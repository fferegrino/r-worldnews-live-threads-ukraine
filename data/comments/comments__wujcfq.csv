🪖 [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1561534935973957633), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561408545073029124.html),  and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561520731011387392.html) have the daily border reports.  The weekend’s guest analyst is Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling [on the war in Ukraine](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561042285214810112.html).

🍄 Ukrainian drone swarms continued to attack Crimea over the weekend hitting all parts of the peninsula including [Sevastopol](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560891101480886275.html) and even the farthest-most tip in [Alupka](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1561314673051332608) proving there is no Ukrainian territory russia can hide in.   We did get several good shots of the drones indicating they are [commercially available drones](https://twitter.com/LavrovTotally/status/1560884190207680512) from Alibaba, modified to [carry an explosive](https://twitter.com/Aviation_Intel/status/1560915127439790080). 

🍄🍿 Between the drones and suspected saboteurs, russia is in [full-on panic mode](https://twitter.com/loogunda/status/1561059132756688898), setting up [obnoxious](https://twitter.com/KramarenkoMari3/status/1561066865966866432) checkpoints, [prohibiting discussion](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560921980928393217.html) of “incidents”,  raiding locals suspected of being saboteurs, closing travel on the Kerch bridge to Ukrainians, requiring special paperwork to travel on the bridge and otherwise [terrorizing the populous](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1561360764484591619).   

🍄 In addition to all the drone excitement there were the usual [HIMARS attacks](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1561191896172601351) that [continue to sap](https://twitter.com/DachiOf/status/1561449959525851139) russia’s ability to fight.

🍄  Ukraine conducted its 37^th attack on [Chornobaivka](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1561027289604825090), better known as the Kherson airport.

🍿 russia accused Kyiv of [poisoning](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1561005261841637380) some of its soldiers in Ukraine with botulism.  Given the notorious low quality of russian rations, the most likely cause of the russian soldier’s misery is the oligarch who pocketed the money meant to ensure the russian soldiers rations were safe.  Still, facts never stood in the way of letting russia engage in some [nuclear terrorism](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561038401364697088.html).  

🥷🏿 Lots of partisan activity this weekend starting with Albania where [2 russians and a Ukrainian](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561075826082340865.html), in the country on tourist visas, were arrested for trying to break into a military base in Gramsh.  Since Albania is a member of NATO, if the alleged saboteurs can be tied to russia it could trigger a NATO [article 4 response](https://twitter.com/PascalHeyman/status/1497120809239863301).   There is a possibility these people are just [urban explorers](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561129048176214016.html) and a possibility they [are not just “urban explorers”](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561121705761902593.html), so we will have to wait on the investigation that will come.

🥷🏿 Alexander Dugin’s daughter, [Darya](https://twitter.com/Brietannia/status/1561133113337585664), was killed by a [car bomb](https://twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1561141766925041668) after attending an event with her father.  Its believed the bomb was meant for [Alexander Dugin](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561359607309680641.html) as he was in the car previously.   It was later reported that Alexander Dugin was [hospitalized](https://twitter.com/OlgaNYC1211/status/1561407809274642434) for a heart attack.  So far Ukraine has [denied it's responsible](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1561283777074286592) for the bombing.  Theories of who is or isn’t  responsible are very numerous and all over the place and since the investigation will be done by russia, we will probably never know the true story.

🥷🏿 There was an [assassination attempt](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1560980769706844160) on the russian appointed head of Mariupol.  He survived to be assassinated on another day.

🥷🏿 In Melitopol, a russian soldier tried to rape a minor girl but was caught by a Ukrainian partisan who [severely injured the soldier](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1561429082897895425.html).  No further details are known.

To be safe, however, [mass gatherings are banned](https://twitter.com/Heroiam_Slava/status/1561289898723778560) in Kyiv from August 22^nd to August 25^th .

👉 If you’ve been following the laugh-a-minute “army games” in russia; over the weekend the [Armenian crew crashed into the Laos team’s tank](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560992033262682112.html) and things just kept getting worse after that.

Due to extreme drought, France has had to [shutter most of its nuclear plants](https://twitter.com/MikeHudema/status/1558479499641192449) and is actually in a worse electric deficit than Germany.

Putin's over-compensating with pomp and pageantry.

Day 180 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it looks like there was no shelling, but they still didn’t forget to fire their missiles from Belgorod. The missile strike today was pretty sudden, as it happened at 9:25pm. This is the earliest time that they launched their missiles in months, it was happening later with each day before, but today it happened at 9pm for some reason.

Because it was so sudden we don’t even know how many missiles were fired exactly. I’m pretty sure 1 missile landed somewhere in Kharkiv, 2 more landed in oblast, and as is tradition – the last missile malfunctioned and landed somewhere in Belgorod, or very close to it, because it triggered car alarms in the city. Russians just can’t stop hitting themselves.

Also out of concern about possible massive missile strikes from Russia during our Independence Day, there will be a long curfew in Kharkiv. It will start at 7pm on 23rd and end on 25th at 7am. I’m pretty sure you are still allowed to go outside if it’s only 100-200m away from your home. And the curfew is extended in general now. Instead of starting at 10pm and ending at 6am, it will now start at 7pm and end at 7am, so we are back to long curfew, unsure if it will stay like that.

Had no idea that rail through Berezyne was even an option here. With [the Galati line into Romania open](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-07/romania-reopens-soviet-era-rail-line-to-aid-ukraine-grain-sales) (and working exactly as I expected it would, just for the record 😁), that should make grain shipments by rail a lot easier. But of course [the Danube has to start drying up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-10/europe-s-low-water-levels-threaten-rhine-river-hit-80b-trade-lifeline) *now* of all times... ugh.

*Edit:* For those wondering what the hell I'm talking about -- Romania and Ukraine have restored two Soviet-era rail lines that should allow the Ukrainians to ship grain through Moldova to the Romanian town of Galati. From Galati, the grain is transported via barge on the Danube River down to the port of Constanta, where it gets shipped out across the Black Sea. Since Romania is a NATO member, the Russians aren't likely to mess with shipments coming from there the way they have with the grain ships coming from Odesa. Mind you, pulling these kinds of crazy logistics no doubt adds to the grain's price. But at least it's something if the Russians decide to clamp down on Odesa again.

Why does it matter? Causing a food crisis by stopping grain shipments is a key Russian tactic in this war. By starving the Third World, the Russians hope to force everyone to acquiesce to whatever gains they make in Ukraine. That they've been letting grain ships out of Odesa is probably an admission that the tactic isn't working, unless the West has been cutting them some kind of break in terms of economic sanctions behind the scenes. (Or maybe they're doing something weird like poisoning the grain fields? That could potentially backfire on them pretty hard, though.)",1661214363.0,1661213390.0,t3_wujcfq,t3_wujcfq,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

Re the NRA: 

I keep seeing people say that because a car was blown up the NRA must be a real thing.  This is a horrible over simplification of the situation.  Is the NRA a real thing or not isn't the point of THIS comment, just want to explain en-mass where this logic is going astray.

Yes, a car was blown-up.  Yes, a group calling itself the NRA is saying they are responsible. Neither of those two statements are being debated.  

What people are failing to understand is, just because a group is claiming responsibility doesn't mean they did it.  Everyone assuming that it is proof they did it and are a real thing really needs to look at the bigger picture.  The best analogy I can think of is Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.

In all those cases, you are told something exists and the proof is that something happened.  Meanwhile it was your parents who did something and then told it was the action of someone else.  This could easily be the same situation.  Or it could be like the kid in school who claimed he did XYZ that happened, even though he had nothing to do with it.

I don't have a problem with people supporting that the NRA is an actual thing (I don't know if they are or aren't for sure either).  I do have a problem with the application of logic that only runs as deep as 'a car blew up, the NRA is real'.

An honest assessment of the situation leads to the following statements possibly being true, all with an equal amount of supporting evidence so far:

1) the NRA is real and is responsible.

2) the NRA is real, but had nothing to do with the bombing and is simply taking credit, but is really 5 guys in a pub.

3) the NRA is the fantasy of someone and they are just taking credit in hopes their fantasy materializes.

4) the NRA is a cover story by a government organization.

Each one of those 4 options has historical precedence.  None of us here know (and if we know we can't say due to security clearance) which one of those 4 options is the actual situation.  Can we PLEASE stop pretending like anything about this situation is truly known, except for the fact that a car blew up, and a group no one ever heard of before is claiming to have done it. 

Sorry for the rant, but I keep seeing the same basic logic being used over and over again, and it is just a dangerous assumption (dangerous in terms of misleading people's understanding of the situation).  It is not different than any number of assumptions that have been made about this situation since the get go; Putin won't invade, Ukraine will fall in 3 days, America will never send (xyz), Ukraine can't (abc), Russia will (def).",False,1661166175.0,t3_wujcfq,t3_wujcfq,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

A legitimate dissident group with the capability of carrying out a car-bomb attack in Moscow would make their existence known before that attack, would claim responsibility either before the attack or nearly simultaneously, would pick a better target, and would offer some evidence to support that claim.






I am extremely skeptical.



If I came up with 100 different theories for what really happened and ranked them all by likelihood? “Previously unknown secret network of dissidents trying to take down the Russian government” would be near the bottom.



I also have “Putin did it so that he could use it as an excuse to crack down on dissent” fairly far down the list, even though Putin will undoubtedly use the attack as best he can. Don’t let a crisis go to waste and all that. But car-bombs going off in Moscow don’t reflect well on him.

There’s no way Kherson will be retaken. And I want it to, badly. It’s critical for shipping access, creating a natural buffer of the river, and retaking the narrative to support more arms and financial backing to Ukraine. 

There was a decent Geopolitics Decanted podcast episode with guests of Michael Koffman and a Ukrainian Colonel. The Colonel admitted that the Ukrainian military leadership, in 30 years of independence, never once trained (in exercises, war games, or even tabletop exercises) for offensive operations. They especially have never trained on assaulting a large, urban center with pre-developed defensive encampments.

This is combined with a deteriorated an exhausted first-tier troops corps and a backbone of barely trained TDF forces (basically militia with second-rate, mismatched gear). Even if you rotate some of the top-tier guys to Kherson, you have nowhere near a 3-1 offensive advantage in manpower. They also have nowhere near 3x the armor, artillery, or munitions. Plus since the Ukrainian military started hyping up the Kherson offensive, 10s of Russian BTGs have flooded into southern Ukraine. Russia has actually pushed back the battle lines further from Kherson. 

The attacks on the bridges have lowered supply access, but not stopped it. Even if the bridges collapse, there’s enough vehicles and armor across the river to keep fighting away from the city. Ferries will get enough munitions across. Russia won’t care about quickly evacing casualties.

Even if the Ukrainians get close to the city, the Russians will level the city a la Mariupol with pre-positioned stationary artillery on the other bank. They’ll also have no problem using the civilians as shields against advancing Ukrainians, so Ukrainian fire into the city will kill or destroy the city as well.

This is combined with what Michael Koffman has said about local reporters confirming no build-up of troops or equipment on the front.

So if there’s any hope of a counter offensive it’s not in Kherson. At best, I could see them focusing on the open terrain north of Melitopol. There’s localized resistance which has proven capable of proving intel. The defenses are less build-up. And the manpower is already built up in the Eastern front, allowing a quicker swing down south. A success there could also cut the rail lines with Russia needs for resupply to Melitopol and the Azov Sea coast.",False,1661183733.0,t3_wujcfq,t3_wujcfq,,0,-71,0,-71,0,0,

But months ago, the Department of Defense's press secretary said something to the effect of ""We're sending highly accurate, guided, 155mm artillery rounds to Ukraine"".

And the defense-guy just kinda of ignored the question.

As per this,

>The analysis of international geopolitics scholars Paul J. Bolt and Sharyl N. Cross is that ""Moscow and Beijing share almost indistinguishable views on the potential domestic and international security threats posed by colored revolutions, and both nations view these revolutionary movements as being orchestrated by the United States and its Western democratic partners to advance geopolitical ambitions.""

The fact that the NRA is using rhetoric which in my opinion, accurately describes the current political dogma facing Russia today, ""Fraticidal war"", changing the constitution to give Putin unbalanced legal powers, absolute control by a dictator and the corruption he's enabling to ensure loyalty and control, arbitrary enforcement of the law, imprisonment of political prisoners, instead of using terminology which would better support the Russian governments conclusions about opposition, suggests to me that its perhaps legitimate and was to a point, a concerted effort at staying under the radar until the opportunity presents itself. This wouldn't be in line with previous attempts at a false flags orchestrated by FSB, GRU or SVR (FSB would be more relevant than the other groups in this case)

To most of us, these false flags couldn't be any more obvious, but to others who are more susceptible to manipulation (Most often their domestic audience), the usual false flags would be convincing enough for them to believe. 

For this to make any sense to me, they would have had to realize that their past attempts at false flags were painfully transparent because they lack any credibility and therefore took a much riskier route using LEGITIMATE criticism against them and using that as their cover story. But this just seems incredibly risky and just outright stupid for them to do.

I guess we just have to wait for more information to come out

**--Plus--**

 Putin wants to give out the impression that the country is locked, safe and sound from outsiders (Azov, Nazis, NATO) or, from the inside, dissidents and traitors. Any kind of threats that can be perceived as immediate to Russia must exist externally, away from anybody who could bare witness and potentially put official Russian government line in doubt if they ever gather any kind of unfavorable evidence. . One of Putins objectives is to convince Russians that they have nothing to fear under Putins Russia. Direct attacks coming from within the country is very counter-productive at this stage versus when Putin blew up a building to go to war against Chechnya, but today, thanks to President Putin's long tenure, those problems no longer exist today.",1661168552.0,1661144949.0,t3_wujcfq,t1_ilaa0d4,,1,39,0,39,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

It’s mostly pushed by the Russians and pro Russians to discourage support for Ukraine by scaring people. Looking at your post history I’m going to assume you’re just a normal person asking a question but you’re going to take some abuse for asking. 

How is this going to end? Likely in one of three ways. 

1. Russia has a general mobilization and grinds down Ukraine by sacrificing more essential young men, worsening their demographic crisis and becoming an international pariah. I’m not sure what this looks like on a map but this it more or less restarts the Cold War but with Russia in a significantly worse position and as a junior partner to China. 

2. Through some combination of western arm twisting, exhaustion, and loss of support in Ukraine, the conflict freezes or some negotiated peace is made. No one is happy with this result so expect someone to reignite the conflict within a decade, likely with both sides significantly better prepared. 

3. Putin feels he can’t mobilize so he maintains what he’s currently doing. Ukraine keeps doing what they’re doing and the war continues for a few more month to a few more years. Eventually through a mixture of grinding assaults, lack of supplies, and low morale the Russian army breaks. I’m not expecting some grand fighting retreat or last stand. In all likelihood more and more of the soldiers decide to just leave. We’re already seeing various reports of numerous soldiers who refuse to participate in assaults and some who wound themselves to go home. This trickle eventually becomes a flood. Ukraine regains most or all of her lost land and Putin is likely to have an accident and be replaced while this is happening.

With multiple dumps getting hit every day, the whole command and control of the Russian army is impacted and has to adapt: much more energy and resource is spent on defence, leaving much less available for attack.  But again, this probably does not itself force a retreat (until morale falls so low that soldiers simply give up; or commanders decide that holding the territory will incur too great a cost).

To be fair, this is only killed. Assuming a 3:1 wounded to killed ratio, Ukraine has 9,000 killed and 27,000 wounded or injured, which is still substantial. However, considering Russia was supposed to be more advanced and was much larger, it should have theoretically taken fewer casualties (if we compared the American invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan). However the CIA and MI6 believe Russia is at around 20,000 deaths, NATO believe Russia has 7,000-15,000 dead, and Ukraine claims 45,500 Russian deaths. A 3:1 ratio would put Russia’s wounded at between 21,000 and 131,000.

To note, Russia’s last casualty update listed 1,351 deaths. However this is assumed to be completely wrong by this stage.

Spot on except that China will have absolutely zero influence on whoever follows Putin if he happens to be deposed because they have no levers with which to control who might come after. That will be decided purely by who can actually command the loyalty of enough of the elite, military and internal security services to actually take control. Russia and China are not really friends, they're just allies of convenience because everyone else dislikes them to varying extent and Russian elites couldn't care less who they want in power.

In addition even in the event that Russia is forced to pull substantially pull back in Ukraine and loses Crimea and most of the eastern gains it's made Putin has extremely tight control over not just the military but also the myriad internal security services, appoints all the regional governors and has stripped away the federal republics autonomy that they were given in the 90's. In addition Putin commands a lot of loyalty amongst the police as he was responsible for significant budget increases after the 1990's. Senior police leaders knows exactly who they owe for that and know they can easily have their own accidents if they step out of line.

Plus he controls the massive media propaganda machine within Russia so even if he clearly loses in Ukraine he can slap a victory sticker on it and even if it's clearly a sham Putin might just skate by with it and remain in power. As much as many think the majority of Russians are pro war the reality is most Russians are apathetic to politics and simply seek to ignore it as best they can. Russians know their vote doesn't count for anything and they know the people in charge don't give a shit about them, they just go on with their lives as best they can.

So with the internal security services, military and police firmly in Putin's pocket and a propaganda machine willing to push even the most batshit crazy narratives that the Putin diehards lap up no matter what and everyone else mostly ignores I think you might be surprised by Putin's chances of holding on to power even if he loses in Ukraine.

I have a couple friends that used to work in TV news and almost anyone with experience has been cut because they cost to much. The experienced people that are left tend to be the senior executives that are not the ones doing the nitty gritty aspects like writing or fact checking. Where as before the kids fresh out of college would be given basic tasks now they are the ones writing the news and as soon as they start to get experience and their salary gets too high they get turfed out and the next group of cheap fresh college grads gets cycled in. Oh and of course they didn't even replace the people in those experienced positions, they just eliminated their positions and dumped the work on whoever was left, which as I mentioned is mostly people with little experience.

All that means that more and more material is just copied verbatim from newswire services like Associated Press and Reuters and when breaking news happens the people left in the newsroom don't have the experience to write their own stories, the time to properly fact check them or to know that anything said on Russian news should be presented as very possibly being little more than propaganda.

Still NATO, but gotta give credit where credit is due for this one. The USA training with M777 probably is more of a standard-artillery loadout rather than an ""elite / crack"" team kinda training. Simplified training, simplified gun (M777 is known to be easier to handle), with more mass production / more guns available. A different kind of purpose compared to a crack/elite team like the French gun donations.

Then again, USA supplied HIMARS and that's definitely ""elite artillery"".

Nonetheless, I will try to give you a sincere answer. 

Nuclear is almost completely unrelated from gas in Germany, given our current energy and electricity infrastructure. Germany has more than enough electricity already. We’re exporting lots of electricity right now. The gain from letting nuclear run longer until the end of winter (which has already been decided, you might have missed that) will save us in total an estimate between 1 and 2 percent of gas. Everything counts. But it’s not as big a gain as you make it seem. We need gas for lots of things other than electricity. 

Gerhard Schröder is an embarrassment. Always has been; no argument there. Luckily, he hasn’t hold any political position in the last 17 years.

The USA did warn all of Europe (not just Germany) all the time and did propose alternatives. That is true. The alternative was: „Don’t buy their gas. Buy our gas!“. Politicians everywhere didn’t take that warning serious, because of the obvious conflict of interests. I won’t blame them for this (in hindsight) error of judgement.

> If you're car-bombing people, I don't think you're ""LARPing"" as terrorists any more.

Yeah, that’s a factual statement and isn’t saying the NRA exists. It’s saying that it can’t be considered LARPing as terrorists if you blow up a car. That’s true whether it’s the NRA or Putin himself. 

> The IRA never pre-announced assassination attempts or attacks that required secrecy to be successful. For a car bomb assassination pre-announcing any kind of attack increases security measures and potentially comprises the entire operation.

> Also the IRA typically only used to pre-announce bombings once the explosives were already in place in order to allow for evacuations for PR reasons.

> Usually never for military or high value targets like Lord Louis Mountbatten.

This is literally just responding to your comment saying the IRA pre-announced car bombings so no one else could take credit. No where does it say that bomb = NRA real. 

> The flaming wreck of a car exists.

This is the third comment and the only one that is even close to your strawman. It’s responding to this comment from you.

> I don't see a reason to BELIEVE they exist.  I didn't say I didn't see a reason why a group like this might exist.  But I don't believe this is such a group.  We will see as time goes on, but this feels more like a random hacking group taking credit for some random website outage.  (Not saying its a hacking group just has all the feel of it).  Right now I am skeptical.  I openly admit it is early and I may be wrong, and will continue to reevaluate.  That said I have read any credible intel brains that believe it either.

You said you see no reason to BELIEVE they exist. A car bomb is evidence to believe that. The use wasn’t saying the NRA was real but there is evidence that a terroristic act happened and they took credit. If you don’t believe that’s evidence of their existence, you don’t know what that means. It doesn’t mean they do exist or even that someone believe they exist. It simply means there is evidence that points to their existence. 

So, again, not a comment that says “ a car exploded so they must exist” but instead one saying “a car exploded which is evidence to believe they exist” which is accurate. It isn’t proof they exist, it’s evidence they exist.

You’re the one speaking in absolutes about how this isn’t evidence. It is. It’s just not conclusive.",1661180809.0,1661180533.0,t3_wujcfq,t1_ilbrvya,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

French has fewer native speakers and not a lot of economic might either. Plus French has the biggest overlap with good English as a second language skills.

What? You’re replying to anyone who says that it’s evidence. Just because you didn’t reply to the comment directly doesn’t change that. You even “quoted” people. That’s a response. It being a “top level comment” doesn’t change that. 

Your entire argument is “THIS ISNT EVIDENCE THEY EXIST!!!!” which is just fucking wrong. It is. Is it conclusive? No. But it’s fucking evidence. 

Believe what you want. It’s fine. But stop making strawmen to argue against.

And you don’t even know what strawman argument is based on your comments 

> an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.

That’s what you did. You said people were saying that because a car exploded the NRA must exist. No one fucking said that. You made it up and then posted an argument against it. That’s the exact fucking definition of a strawman argument. You are misrepresenting other commenters position because you can’t argue against what they actually said.

Edit to add: also, you’re using the classic Trump-esque technique of “many people” and “lots of comments” without actually showing shit. Don’t you feel embarrassed by that?

Also, I can’t get over the fact that you think that the type of comment matters when it comments to whether or not your arguing or making up strawman arguments. Like, you realize these fallacies existed prior to Reddit, right?",1661182395.0,1661181964.0,t3_wujcfq,t1_ilbw6nk,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

And when you have a business unit that is constantly losing money chances are that you aren't giving them as much money next year of course and you might just cut it entirely. Unless you feel that maintaining it brings intangibles that make up for the loss, for a large TV network that means having what looks like a professional news program and that needs at least some kind of newsroom but it gets given as little money as possible. So they leave them on life support so that they can seem reputable but behind the scenes it's barely functional.

Yep, a talking head that randomly blathers for half an hour you can just bumper with ""any opinions expressed by the host are not endorsed by the network"" is way cheaper than a dozen people working behind the scenes gathering and crafting a solid half hour of news.
