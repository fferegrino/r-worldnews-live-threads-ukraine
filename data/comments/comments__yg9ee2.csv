Day 248 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet yet again; there were no missile strikes and no drones. As usual we had quite a lot of air raid alerts, which thankfully were uneventful. During one of those alerts they did fire some missiles, some of which were intercepted, but not all of them. This time they were aiming at critical infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia, not sure what exactly, but they did manage to hit it.

It was great seeing our drones hit Russian ships in Sevastopol this morning. As always Russians are saying that attack was repelled, and that the damage caused to the ships is insignificant. But the last time they were saying that about their ships, was the time Moskva sunk. It will be interesting to see the actual extent of damage caused to their ships, hopefully some of them do sink.

And of course Russians are being childish as usual, stopping the grain deal because we attacked their ships, the same ships that are raining our cities with missiles. So destroying their military ships that attack our cities with missiles is somehow a terrorist act, but when they hit port of Odesa, literally on the next day after signing the grain deal, that was completely fine, and not a terrorist act? This is just laughable, do they not understand just how stupid they sound when they say shit like this?

>Every person in our country who woke on 24 February and saw the images of rocket attacks in Kyiv, of columns of tanks on Ukrainian streets, of the vast scale of the Russian invasion – everyone who woke to these images knew that, on that morning, the world had become a different one.

>Nobody felt the dreadful horror of that morning as deeply as the people of Ukraine itself. I sat with some of them on Tuesday in Koriukivka, a small town near the Belarusian border, in an underground bomb shelter. These people told me their stories, told me how this twenty-fourth of February, the horror of war, erupted into their thoroughly normal lives: the terrible noise of the bombardments, the smoke, the fire, their sudden, naked fear – these men and women trembled as they spoke to me. An older woman recounted how she had watched the seemingly endless convoy of Russian tanks, lorries and military equipment roll past together with her grandson. The grandson looked at her and asked: ""Grandma, are we going to die?"" The grandmother could not answer his question – something that still brings tears to her eyes today.

>Each and every one of you will remember this 24 February. As do I. The wailing of sirens and the dark smoke over Kyiv, the terrible images of that morning affected me, but more than that – they marked the definitive, bitter failure of years of political efforts, including my efforts, to prevent precisely this terrible moment.

The gunner has the Fotona SGS-55 two-axis stabilized day-and-night sight with an integral laser rangefinder. In addition to the integral optic sight the commander has the Fotona COMTOS-55 sight with an independent line-of-sight stabilization, which allows him to acquire targets and lay the gun independently if required. The driver has the Fotona CODRIS combined day/night observation periscope. The LIRD-1A laser illumination warning receiver was mated with front-mounted IS-6 smoke grenade launchers (of which there are six in two clusters, one per side of the turret) and can be automatically activated in an emergency.

The tank can also lay a smoke screen by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust outlet on the left hand side of the hull.

At that point, there are few (basically just Syrian) ports for Russia to operate from in the Med. If they try and run the blockade at Gibraltar, they get sunk. If they stray outside of Syrian waters, Israel harasses them and keeps them away from Ukrainian grain cargo.

9ca1260e4f95516165acd5c5cd0330b1,yg9ee2,iu82of1,"Forbes; ix years ago, the Russian navy formed a new army corps whose job it would be to defend Kaliningrad, Russia’s geographically separate outpost on the Baltic Sea between Poland and Lithuania.

This year, when the war in Ukraine began to go badly for Russia, the Kremlin yanked the 11th Army Corps from Kaliningrad and sent it into Ukraine. Where the Ukrainian army quickly destroyed it.

The formation, deployment and destruction of the 11th Army Corps tell a story that’s bigger than the tragic tale of Russia’s war in Ukraine. The corps, sandwiched between two NATO countries along a strategic sea, was supposed to give Russian forces an advantage in a global war.

Instead, it became cannon fodder for a Ukrainian army that, on paper, was weaker than the Russian army was. Now Kaliningrad is all but defenseless, and the threat the oblast’s troops once posed to NATO … has evaporated.

The 11th Army Corps isn’t really a new formation. It’s a new grouping of existing formations under a single headquarters that itself answers to the Russian navy’s Baltic Fleet. The corps oversees a motorized division, a separate motorized regiment, artillery, rockets, air-defense troops and supporting units.

Before Russia widened its war in Ukraine starting in late February, there were no fewer than 12,000 Russian troops in Kaliningrad with around 100 T-72 tanks, a couple hundred BTR fighting vehicles, Msta-S howitzers and BM-27 and BM-30 rocket-launchers. The 11th Army Corps oversaw most of these forces.

Looming on the western border of Lithuania, one of the weakest NATO member states, the 11th Army Corps was the anvil for a possible Russian invasion of the former Soviet republics Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. The hammer was the 18,000-strong ground force in western Russia on the eastern border of the Baltic states.

NATO warily eyed the Kaliningrad buildup. “Kaliningrad certainly, historically, has been a place where we've been very attentive to the dynamics and the delicate regional situation,” a U.S. defense official told reporters in June.

Those dynamics radically changed after February. The Kremlin committed 80% of its ground forces to a wider invasion of Ukraine—and promptly lost many of them in a doomed bid to capture Kyiv.",False,1667030003.0,t3_yg9ee2,t1_iu81u3i,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

 >The 2022 Chornobaivka attacks consist of a series of Ukrainian attacks against the Russian-held Kherson International Airport at Chornobaivka, which began on 27 February 2022 during the southern Ukraine campaign of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Chornobaivka, located in Ukraine's Kherson Oblast, has seen a total of 39 attacks on Russian positions by the Ukrainian Armed Forces following a bombing and takeover by the Russian Armed Forces of the town's airport. According to Ukraine, these attacks resulted in the death of the Russian general Yakov Rezantsev of the 49th Combined Arms Army on 24 March.

The extremely slow pace would mean that you could really only hit buildings, since they don't tend to move about the place so you can safely assume they'll still be there 77 days later. Since buildings are generally above ground, there are more practical weapons you could use to destroy them.

However, the total number of those mobilized should be greater than Shoigu claims: how many people were called up in the remaining 32 regions for which we could not find data is unknown. The Minister of Defense claimed that all subjects of the Russian Federation received mobilization tasks.

>Even when the 300 thousand people promised by the authorities are called to the front, the mobilization will not stop, CIT experts believe. “We see that they are trying to call on all 300,000 at once. One could assume that they will stretch it out over several waves, they will replenish it little by little, but no, CIT experts comment on the mobilization process. “Further mobilization may be required to make up for the losses [among those called up in the first wave]. On the other hand, it may be that the figures of 1 or 1.2 million [ voiced by the media, citing sources in power] are those whom they plan to call in principle, and they will not need more until the end of the war. Perhaps these 300 thousand will be called up now, and the rest will be recruited gradually, as losses are incurred. In any case, we do not believe that the mobilization will be limited to 300,000.”

The protection vessels don't need to be good. They don't need to be capable. They just need to be *there*.

Something like their Tuzla-class patrol boats would be more than adequate. To be honest, even a tiny inflatable dinghy with a little outboard engine, crewed by a single Turkish sailor but carrying a massive Turkish flag would be sufficient. In fact, there's no reason it even has to be crewed, unmanned vessels flagged as Turkish military are still valid military vessels.

The moment Russia fires on Turkish vessels, Turkey would open the straits to NATO for backup that it's entitled to receive. Of course, that also means they have to open it up for Russian ships not based in the Black Sea... but those ships have to first get there, and secondly have to take the risk that Turkey won't sink them as they pass, which, if Russian vessels in the Black Sea are firing on Turkish ships, is very, *very* much a risk.

So basically, Russia could try this, but it would get pretty bad for them and they would unquestionably be the escalatory party. It would be a very rapid non-nuclear way to fast-track into being a pariah state. I can't imagine China would be too keen on remaining allied to them if they start shooting first at NATO ships.

If Russian vessels are firing naval guns into, launching missiles at, or in the case of submarines actively operating within, NATO waters, then they're going to find themselves on the receiving end of a lot of justified hurt that is *not* an escalation if Russia fired first. If they start sinking grain vessels in Romanian, Bulgarian, or Turkish water, they're going to get sunk by NATO forces.

So, Russia can't interdict once the ships pull out of Odesa because they'll be in NATO waters, and to hit the ships in Odesa (and the Ukrainian coast), they're exposing themselves to counter-fire from shore-based Ukrainian missile systems. Russia's Black Sea Fleet is already heavily depleted, and any attempt to get surface vessels close to Odesa now is suicide.

Waiting an extra day for a grain shipment is much better than that shipment being at the bottom of the sea and unlike consumer level insurance claims, all the money in the world won't bring that amount of grain back until next year's harvest.

Even if they can't kill the subs, they can just work around them to some extent.
