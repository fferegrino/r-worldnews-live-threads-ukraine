Average pay for Russian **Lieutenant** appears to be 80k rubles a month or 960k (we'll round up to 1M rubles a year). https://russiandefpolicy.com/2021/12/27/russian-military-pay-still-lags/

Offering enlisted/conscripted ranks the equivalent of **FIVE YEARS** officer salary seems like an amazing deal, or **208 YEARS** of a conscript salary.

EDIT: Found some more sources about non-officer pay

Looks like 24k rubles a year for conscripts and 62k rubles for contract solders.

The agency said after a meeting of officials from its 22 member states that it was assessing the consequences of sanctions for its cooperation with Russia‚Äôs Roscosmos space agency.

‚ÄúThe sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely,‚Äù for the Europe-Russia ExoMars rover mission, the agency said in a statement.

The launch was already postponed from 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak and technical problems. It was due to blast off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan in September using a Russian Proton rocket. Postponing a launch often means waiting for months or years until another window opens when planets are in the right alignment.

The goal is to put Europe‚Äôs first rover on the red planet to help determine whether there has ever been life on Mars. A test rover launched in 2016 crash-landed at Mars, highlighting the difficulty of putting a spacecraft on the planet.

In Kharkiv russian forces are using heavy artillery and bombs on civilian structures, killing children and women. In Kiev, too.

>WASHINGTON ‚Äì During several encounters with Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recalled, a consistent image stuck with her: that of a ""cold and calculating"" leader true to his background in the dark arts of the KGB, the Soviet-era spy agency.  
>  
>Less than a week into Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Rice has noticed a troubling change.  
>  
>""I have met with him many times, and this is a different Putin,"" Rice told ""Fox News Sunday,"" suggesting that Ukraine's ferocious resistance has rattled the enigmatic strongman. ""He seems erratic. ‚Ä¶ He has descended into something I have not seen before.‚Äù  
>  
>Rice's comments underscored assessments from an increasing number of current and former U.S. officials, as Putin escalated tensions Sunday by placing Russia's nuclear forces on alert amid the invasion of Ukraine.",1646077030.0,1646076961.0,t3_t3lrj9,t3_t3lrj9,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

#‚Ä¢ EU (UE) - the European Union

The EU is a european political trading bloc consisting of 27 member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Louxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden)

#‚Ä¢ NATO - North Atlantic Treaty Organization

NATO is a defensive alliance between EU member states and the US, UK, Canada, Norway, Albania, Turkey, Iceland and Montenegro. 

EU member states who are NOT members of NATO are: Austria, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Cyprus.

**Important: NATO =/= EU. NATO has member states that are not part of the EU and vice versa.**

The NATO defense mechanism Art 5 states, that an attack on one member, is considered to be an attack on all of NATO.

The current Secretary General of NATO is Jens Stoltenberg.

#‚Ä¢ PfP - Partnership for Peace

#‚Ä¢ BRICS - Association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

The BRICS states are an association for 5 major emerging economies around the world. The aim is to deepen economic, political and cultural co-operation between the member states. 

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

_Note: BRICS association is a reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis_

#‚Ä¢ CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Current members are: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan

Up until the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan had been granted observer status.


#‚Ä¢ UN - United Nations

The United Nations are an intergovernmental organization aiming to maintain global peace. Every sovereign state is a member of the UN (193) with the EU having an additional Observer Status. 

The current Secretary General of the UN is Antonio Guterres

#‚Ä¢ UNSC - United Nations Security Council

The Security council has the power to make binding decisions which UN member states have to carry out, since they have agreed to that by signing the UN Charta (Art 25). 

The UNSC consists of 15 members, of which 5 members are permanent members (The US, France, UK, China and Russia) - only the 5 permanent members have the power to Veto a UN resolution, and 10 non-permanent members (Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, UAE) which are elected for two year terms by the UN assembly. 

The presidency of the UNSC rotates alphabetically between the member states every month:

Jan - Norway ; **Feb - Russia** ; March - UAE ; Apr - UK ; May - US ; June - Albania ; July - Brazil ; Aug - China ; Sept - France ; Oct - Gabon ; Nov - Ghana ; Dec - India

#‚Ä¢ DPR (DNR) and LPR (LNR) - Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic

Are two self-proclaimed breakaway Regions in eastern Ukraine which were officially recognised as independent states by Russia on Feb 21 in the prelude to this war.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#‚Ä¢ How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

Speaking after a government meeting today, Kaikkonen told reporters:

The anti-tank weapons can be used to fight armoured vehicles.

Kaikkonen hinted yesterday that the Finnish government was considering scrapping Finland‚Äôs long-standing policy of not allowing weapons to be exported to war zones.

The minister also said that Finland, which is not a Nato member and shares a long border with Russia, had given the green light to Estonia to send previously Finnish-owned field guns to Ukraine.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

It seems like there are a very significant number of posts here hyping up nukes in various ways, from commenting on the existential terror people feel to ‚Äúasking questions‚Äù about what nuclear damage might look like.

Remember that the Russian trolls who tried to convince the world to let Ukraine fall are still very active. Amping up nuclear existential dread is absolutely one of their goals, and as this is Putin‚Äôs last theoretical refuge when faced with a surprisingly united European and broader world, be wary. Unfortunately, this is also many people‚Äôs first brush with mortality, so there are plenty of people doing their work for them unwittingly.

Want to know how you live with the specter of death? By embracing what life gives you. Everything you experience in life has a temporal component; the good times and bad times are importantly both times. There is joy and pain to be found in every day, just as there was before Putin attempted to destroy another nation for his personal benefit. Embrace how sweet a lover‚Äôs hand is in yours, or the pride you feel at your child‚Äôs achievements. Live courageously; do not let a weak, hateful man rob your days of the happiness, pain, and strength that comes from overcoming challenges. Given that this will also rob him of his power is the cherry on top.

An abuser - especially a narcissist who has exulted in attacking our civil society for decades - needs you to give him permission to leave you in fear. I urge everyone here not to succumb to his need for you to let life become tainted by his  stain. If you think for a second this parallel doesn‚Äôt hold, consider this: keeping you paralyzed and fearful is his goal on a cultural and societal level. It allows him to win. If you would not let someone abuse your family or friends in real life, have that same compassion for yourself and live something better.",False,1646072325.0,t3_t3lrj9,t3_t3lrj9,,0,45,0,45,1,0,

* Putin gambled that the West was too preoccupied to condemn his occupation of Crimea, and he lost; sanctions started immediately, beginning a precipitous decline in Russia's economy while basically nobody acknowledged the occupation
* Hitler gambled that the West would rather cede Austria and then the Sudetenland than face war in Europe, and he won, immediately collecting enormous amounts of war supplies and effectively turning Germany into the largest economy in Europe
* Putin gambled that the West would rather cede the Donbass than levy harsh sanctions and risk war in Europe; he lost, and was forced into either revealing his bluff or launching a military invasion of Ukraine
* Hitler invaded Poland and crushed resistance, effectively scaring the entirety of the Allies from any kind of offensive campaign and pushing Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and later Italy into his arms
* Putin invaded Ukraine and immediately faceplanted, showing the entire world that Russia was a paper tiger and encouraging all but Russia's closest allies (and even some of them) to totally distance themselves from Russia

Putin seems similar to Hitler in his overall callousness and disregard for human life. But likening Putin to Hitler due to his geopolitical moves over the past 8 years is giving him too much credit. Hitler and Putin have had similar initial ambitions, but Hitler largely achieved them in the early years while it's had to imagine how Putin could have messed up worse.",False,1646074468.0,t3_t3lrj9,t3_t3lrj9,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

**Ungarn will Waffenlieferungen f√ºr die Ukraine nicht durchlassen**

Ungarn will die Lieferung von Waffen f√ºr die Ukraine √ºber sein Staatsgebiet nicht zulassen. ""Wir werden den Transport t√∂dlicher Waffen √ºber ungarisches Gebiet nicht gestatten"", schrieb Au√üenminister Peter Szijjarto auf Facebook. Szijjarto erl√§uterte, die Entscheidung sei getroffen worden, um die Sicherheit von ungarischen B√ºrgern auf beiden Seiten der Grenze zu gew√§hrleisten. Die Milit√§rtransporte k√∂nnten ""leicht zum Angriffsziel"" werden, f√ºgte der Minister hinzu. Die EU hatte am Wochenende 450 Millionen Euro f√ºr Waffenlieferungen an die von Russland angegriffene Ukraine freigegeben.

**Hungary won't let through arms deliveries for Ukraine**

Hungary will not allow the delivery of weapons for Ukraine through its territory. ""We will not allow the transport of lethal weapons through Hungarian territory,"" Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook. Szijjarto explained that the decision was made to ensure the safety of Hungarian citizens on both sides of the border. The military transports could ""easily become a target of attack,"" the minister added. Over the weekend, the EU had released 450 million euros for arms deliveries to Ukraine, which is under attack from Russia.

The call from MEPs follows images from Kyiv of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy signing the formal letter of application for EU membership.

An EU official has explained the process. The letter of application is written to the president of the council of the EU which is currently held by France.

Member states, the European parliament and national parliaments are then informed of the application by the council.

A meeting of the 27 EU affairs ministers, known as the general affairs council, needs to take a decision to formally seek the European Commission‚Äôs opinion on the application.

It would normally take 15 to 18 months for a commission to issue its opinion although that period could be significantly shortened ‚Äúdepending on the political considerations‚Äù, the official said.

There is a pre-accession period of varying length, during which the candidate country adapts its institutions, standards and infrastructure to enable it to meet its obligations as a member state. The accession process involves compliance with the accession criteria including adoption and implementation of EU law.

>Two things stand out about it. The first is that we could all participate. It was people outside the region deciding whose message went viral, whose side of the story was winning out. But importantly, it was not just winning out online, but it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions. When you go back and map out the targeting by Israeli airstrikes and the pace of them, essentially they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out online. So what was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones, reflecting what you and I were clicking on.

It'll be interesting to see what sort of studies come out after the Russian invasion is over.

8dceca85123b28b7976d82754917436c,t3lrj9,hyt1owa,"After five brutal days of fighting, the first round of talks between Ukraine and Russia ended inconclusively.

Mykhailo Podoliak, advisor to the head of President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs administration, said that a number of core themes had been identified, and that the delegations would go back to their capitals for further discussion. The discussion mainly focused on stopping the fighting.

Negotiations were held on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border near the Prypyat River. 

Podoliak said that the two sides would hold a second round of talks at the earliest possible opportunity.

‚ÄúAt (these talks), the themes (discussed today) will be concretely developed,‚Äù he said.

Podolyak then tweeted that while it did not impose any ultimatums, the Russian side ‚Äúunfortunately still has a non-objective understanding of the destruction it has caused.‚Äù

According to the Ukrainian government, the war has cost 352 Ukrainian lives and approximately 5,300 Russian ones. Russia only acknowledged taking casualties four days into the war, and has thus far refused to give any numbers.

The Ukrainian side was represented by Podoliak, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov, ruling party leader David Arakhamia, Deputy Foreign Minister Mykola Tochytskyi, diplomat Andriy Kostin, and lawmaker Rustem Umerov. 

Russia was represented by Presidential Advisor Vladimir Medinsky, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko, lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, and Russian ambassador to Belarus Boris Gryzlov.

Ukraine went into talks demanding an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all Russian forces from Ukraine.

Podolyak said on Feb. 27 that Russia was seeking to force Ukraine into an ‚Äúunacceptable compromise‚Äù with its all-out assault on Ukraine.

Zelensky said previously that he did not believe the negotiations would yield a positive outcome, but that talks would go ahead so that ‚Äúno citizen of Ukraine doubts that I, as president, tried to stop the war when there was still a chance, however small.‚Äù

Despite an overwhelming manpower and equipment advantage, Russia‚Äôs five-day assault has been marked by tactical failures. Multiple videos have shown Russian tanks and APCs abandoned by roadsides after they ran out of fuel, and many attacks have been beaten back by Ukrainian forces.

According to Bellingcat, Russia has started using cluster munitions in Kharkiv. Cluster bombs are prohibited by a treaty ratified by 110 countries, of which Russia is not one. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also facing domestic opposition to the war after several thousand protestors came out onto the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg despite totalitarian anti-demonstration laws. Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have also publicly called for peace.

Russia has also been pressured by Western sanctions, namely the closure of EU, U.K., and Canadian airspace to all Russian-registered aircraft, and EU plans to throw several large Russian banks off SWIFT, the global payment order system. 

The Russian ruble is 30% down today despite intervention from Russia‚Äôs Central Bank, and analysts fear a possible run on the banks.

Day that changed everything

Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine began just after 4:45 a.m. Kyiv time on Feb. 24, when Putin announced a ‚Äúspecial operation‚Äù to ‚Äúdisarm and de-Nazify‚Äù Ukraine. This was immediately followed by cruise missile strikes on major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, and multi-directional assaults towards Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, and Mariupol.

The outskirts of Kyiv, Ukraine‚Äôs capital, have turned into a major combat zone, with Ukraine‚Äôs government claiming to have destroyed 100 Russian vehicles yesterday in the satellite town of Bucha. 

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that nine civilians and 18 Ukrainian soldiers had died in the city since fighting began, and 106 civilians and soldiers were injured.

The assault was prefaced with an escalation of shelling by Russia and its proxies from the occupied Donbas territories over the previous week. Putin then announced he was recognizing the occupied regions as independent states on Feb. 21. The Russian Parliament officially approved the decision the next day.

U.S. and U.K. intelligence had been warning of an imminent attack since late November 2021. However, Zelensky continued to downplay the threat up until as late as Jan. 28, accusing Western leaders of spreading ‚Äúpanic.‚Äù Ukraine did not begin to mobilize its reserves until Feb. 23, the day before the invasion.

However, since the beginning of an all-out offensive, Zelensky has received plenty of plaudits for his wartime leadership. The president, who is still in Kyiv, responded to a U.S. offer to evacuate him by publicly stating ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a ride, I need ammo.‚Äù

People say that Hungary refuses to support Ukraine and that we support Russia's actions towards Ukraine. THIS IS NOT TRUE! I cannot stress this enough. Hungary does in no way support anything that Russia is doing right now. Both the common people of Hungary and it's government CONDEMS Russia for what they did/are doing.

To the people who're saying that Hungary doesn't support Ukraine. We DO support Ukraine's fight against the Russians. We are actively taking in as many refugees from Ukraine as we can. We are also sending supplies like food, fuel and medical supplies. Hungary only refused to let weapon convoys through.

There are multiple reasons for this.

1) The government fears, that the convoys would come under attack while they're in transit through Hungary. While I don't fully agree with this, I must admit, that it would give Russians a valid reason to unleash hell on our country.

2) Hungary wants to remain as neutral as possible in this conflict. Personally I don't agree that we should remain neutral, but you also need to take it into account that Hungary is a neighbouring country to Ukraine, and if things go south, we don't really stand a chance against the Russians. Which brings me to point number 3.

3) Hungarian military is yet to be fully modernised. Until 2015, we only had really old weapons (mainly Ak based weapons which were produced in the 1970s), and old military vehicles, so we are not really on par with the Russians. And because we are located so close to them, we have to play it safe so we won't be among the first ones to be annihilated, if Putin does decide to start World War 3.

4) Hungary is dependent on Russian natural gas. It's sad but it's a fact. If we lose the gas we receive from Russia, Hungary will be fucked. The majority of people would't have anything to heat their homes with and a lot of companies would go bankrupt, leading to an economic depression.

So to anyone reading this. We DO want to help Ukraine. We are doing the best we can. We are trying to help out any way we can but there are a lot of concerns that simply cannot be ignored. A lot of us don't agree with the decision not to let weapon convoys through, but ultimately the choice is not ours, but the governments. So I think it's unfair of you to judge the whole nation based on the choices of our government alone.",False,1646076437.0,t3_t3lrj9,t3_t3lrj9,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

As a person from a small european country with a looong looooong history with Russian agression (my entire family is made up of the offspring of refugees eho had to flee due to russian aggression), I truly hope these imperialists from both countries will calm down their posturing and try to keep in mind what's truly important, the survival of civilians. Once there are mountains of ukrainian civilians death, I truly hope thei get to make the decision if they want to continue the war or not. Being a citizen of a minor power following politica you quite quickly learn to understand that wars and negotiations in general are not you forcefully trying to have your goals met, but true compromises, even with loss of territory and complete control over allining yourself with other nations. My country has gone trough that, my country has experienced the consequences of that for decades and still does to this day. It's not easy, but in the intereat of world peace, the survival of your nation and the survival of your people, you sometimes have to make these horrific yet necessary compromises. Many Ukrainians might not have realised this yet, and most Americans may never realize it. I continue to pray for the Ukrainian leadership to have wisdom, and the courage it takes to make these hard compromises.

With that in mind, and no policy or plan to motivate voters, they use anger as motivation, because getting their vase to actually show up at the polls and vote is mandatory.

So they keep them angry at Democrats, at the government itself, and keep them perpetually afraid that 'the socialist democrats are going to destroy this country' and 'the government is taking away your freedom.'  This is the essence of Trumpism and Make America Great Again.

As part of keeping the ager up, any action by Democrats is opposed.  Have to wear a face mask for COVID? Well, that's government taking freedom.  Too many people dying? Well, government isn't doing enough.

If the Russians can't even invest into their own companies anymore using market-principles, that's going to be worse for their economy than anything else.

Imagine if you're a business owner trying to raise money in Russia. You were planning to raise money today (or tomorrow) through an IPO, but the market is closed. Now what?

You're screwed. No public money means no more expansion. No more expansion means that every day that market is closed is another day where Russian startups / businesses are unable to trade equity for immediate money.

They have lots of those weapons coming. Drones and aircraft are much more precious and harder to acquire or replace. This isn't like a few days ago where they were ambushing Russia at-will. Russia has reinforced their defenses for their supply lines around Kyiv. Ukraine's anti-tank weapons also have limited range.  They'll need the Russians to get closer to take them out.

Drones seem to be focused on anti-air batteries based on the footage I've seen.  That makes a lot of sense.  Drones can hide and strike anti-air which will allow Ukraine to contest the skies with their fighters. They don't want to use planes for this because they are larger and more vulnerable to Russia's anti-air capabilities.  Also, they can't use troops and tanks because Russia can defend their anti-air units from the ground.  Ukraine has fewer anti-air units than Russia.  They'll need to destroy every one they can find to give their fighters their best chance at survival.

Ukraine's airforce will likely be focused on countering Russia's big push that is coming and contesting Russia's attempt at achieving air supremacy .  Russia will want to use their own airforce to support their combined arms offensive and take out Ukrainian strong-points to allow tanks/infantry to advance without getting mowed down. If Ukraine can keep their airforce in reserve, then they can pick their battles and force the Russians to fight at a disadvantage and inflict disproportionate losses. Allowing them to continue fighting until russia loses. Wasting planes to kill tanks and leaving your own defenses vulnerable would be bad.

Excerpt:

>So why is this happening? Corruption and a toxic culture in the Russian military.

>We've been seeing reports that Russian conscripts are being forced into becoming contract Soldiers. Conscripts in the Russian Army serve for only 1 year. To preserve institutional knowledge among the enlisted, the Russian military reformed in 2008 to encourage Soldiers to sign service contracts in the same way the U.S. Military does.

>These contract service members usually serve as the combat arms component, while conscripts serve as the logistics and support roles.

>Elite units like the VDV are comprised of contract Soldiers, and some units (guards divisions with high concentrations of non-ethnic Russians) have contractors as their NCO Corps only.

>Based on the Soldiers captured by UA, and the lack of tactics shown in the Russian offensives, we‚Äôre seeing that a lot of these Soldiers are probably conscripts forced into contract service, but why? The easiest answer is that manpower has been attrited before the invasion, and I see the following contributors:

>A. The Soldiers committed are of those non-ethnic Russian divisions from the East. Early reports of the composition of forces around Ukraine showed the presence of these Soldiers, deployed there because of the lack of a cultural connection to Ukrainians. However, based on the Slavic appearance of POWs, this is not entirely the case.

>B. COVID decimated the manpower of the combat arms components. Most of the disinformation campaigns that hit the United States regarding vaccination were from Russian troll accounts. Information is a double edged sword though because it probably was consumed by the most conservative members of Russian society, the contract servicemen. Reports during the build up indicated that COVID was flowing through the Russian formations due to the poor living conditions they endured.

>C. Putin is keeping the bulk of his most experienced Soldiers close by to protect against a coup. The mismanagement of logistics in the Russian military indicate that the staff planning the offensive are not the same staff who planned the 2014 hybrid war. The 2020 poisoning of Navalny cues us on a potential wider political purge in the Kremlin. I suspect Gerasimov was removed due to the praise and recognition he received for execution of the Donbas campaign. He was seen as a political threat in the same way that Hitler saw Rommel as a threat. Putin‚Äôs recent behavior indicates paranoia and isolation, supporting the assumption that he‚Äôs worried about a coup and therefore keeping forces on standby.

>D. The Russian unit commanders in their corruption were probably making their slides green on personnel, so readiness was misrepresented to the Kremlin. When shit hit the fan, they had to make up for the ghosts on their rosters and force conscript Soldiers into contracts.",False,1646076856.0,t3_t3lrj9,t1_hytd9nj,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

However, Russia's over-reliance on their elite troops so far suggests a lack of confidence in their regulars.

Militarily? No. They are doing incredibly well... But Russia is advancing (slowly), have taken several cities, and have more supplies and vehicles now within sight of Kiev. The key is the rate of advance, unless Russia gathers some momentum, then each day is a failure. The question is can Ukraine stall that advance so much that Russia will succumb to the effects of the humiliation and sanctions before the forces can achieve their goals.

So it is in India‚Äôa best interest now to be quiet about Russia‚Ä¶

1. The US and Allies have been spying on Russia like a hawk for years. Russia has carried out many tests. We know what tests look like. We will absolutely know when something is brewing that doesn't look like just another test. So far, the US has seen no indication of nuclear ""preparedness"" other than Putin spewing words.

2. Modern Russian warfare is more about tactical (nonstrategic) nukes. Basically, these are smaller warheads that would be brought into battle and would have a much smaller damage zone. I have no doubt Putin will try this in Ukraine because this will REALLY test the West. How do we respond to nukes being used on the battlefield in a non-NATO country? I'm not worried about a nuke coming to the US until this happens. 

3. Biden is arguably one of the best people to have in this position. Say whatever you want about him. He's not hot-headed. He's not here for a dick measuring contest. He has decades of foreign policy experience. He's not escalating anything after Putin's nuke threat. Our intelligence community has been spot on this entire time and I really do believe they'd be equally as transparent about nuclear movements. We don't spend almost a trillion dollars on the military for nothing.

On top of that, today's speech on the Russian soldier's text conversation with his mother effectively pushes more blame onto Putin specifically. To craft such a complex public image in such a short amount of time is truly exceptional.

This isn't to discredit any of it--and I absolutely agree with their stances-- it's just to say that the Ukrainian government knows how to draw attention to the type of stories that grips the public, and to do it in such a way that we consistently think they're winning the war.
