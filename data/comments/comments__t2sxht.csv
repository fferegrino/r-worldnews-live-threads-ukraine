More details now on the new measures announced by the European Union.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc would, for the first time in its history, ""finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack"".

She also said that three new tranches of sanctions would be introduced. They are:

Banning all Russian aircraft from its airspace

""We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians,"" von der Leyen said.

""We're proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered, and Russian-controlled aircraft.

""These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off, or overfly the territory of the European Union.""

She said the move would also cover the private jets of Russian oligarchs.

Banning what von der Leyen called the ""Kremlin's media machine""

""The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin's war,"" she said.

""We are developing tools to ban that toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe"".

#• EU - the European Union

The EU is a european political trading bloc consisting of 27 member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Louxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden)

The EU has a defensive mechanism where if one state is being attacked, other member states _shall offer support_

The current president of the EU (Commission) is Ursula Von der Leyen

#• NATO - North Atlantic Treaty Organization

NATO is a defensive alliance between EU member states and the US, Canada, Norway, Albania, Turkey, Iceland and Montenegro. 

EU member states who are NOT members of NATO are: Austria, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Cyprus.

 Important: NATO =/= EU. NATO has member states that are not part of the EU and vice versa. 

The NATO defense mechanism Art 5 states, that an attack on one member, is considered to be an attack on all of NATO.

The current Secretary General of NATO is Jens Stoltenberg.

#• UN - United Nations

The United Nations are an intergovernmental organization aiming to maintain global peace. Every sovereign state is a member of the UN (193) with the EU having an additional Observer Status. 

The current Secretary General of the UN is Antonio Guterres

#• UNSC - United Nations Security Council

The Security council has the power to make binding decisions which UN member states have to carry out, since they have agreed to that by signing the UN Charta (Art 25). 

The UNSC consists of 15 members, of which 5 members are permanent members (The US, France, UK, China and Russia) - only the 5 permanent members have the power to Veto a UN resolution, and 10 non-permanent members (Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, UAE) which are elected for two year terms by the UN assembly. 

The presidency of the UNSC rotates alphabetically between the member states every month:

Jan - Norway ; **Feb - Russia** ; March - UAE ; Apr - UK ; May - US ; June - Albania ; July - Brazil ; Aug - China ; Sept - France ; Oct - Gabon ; Nov - Ghana ; Dec - India

But that doesn't mean they shy away from conflict, either. Leaders of smaller forces often acted assertively, meeting challenges head-on.

And don't forget hubris, O'Brien says: ""There's also, on the other side (Putin), almost invariably a great deal of overconfidence which kills an army again and again and again.""

> The German government had asked utility firm Uniper (UN01.DE) to resume its plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Wilhelmshaven, Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Sunday, as Germany steps up its plans to cut dependence on Russian gas.

> Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday said Germany will make good on plans to build two LNG terminals and up its natural gas reserves to cut its dependence on Russian gas after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

> ""We will do more to ensure secure energy supply for our country,"" he told lawmakers in a special Bundestag session called to address the Ukraine crisis.

> Scholz said the two LNG terminals will be in Brunsbuettel and Wilhelmshaven. Uniper has an LNG terminal in Wilhelmshaven which it had shelved in 2020, citing reluctance by market players to make binding bookings for import capacities.

> The government is now in talks with the Dusseldorf-based firm to resume building the terminal, Handelsblatt reported, citing people familiar with matter.

> Uniper was not immediately available for comment and the Economy Ministry declined to comment.

> Germany has been under pressure from other Western nations to become less dependent on Russian gas, but its plans to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2030 and to shut its nuclear power plants have left it with few options.

> Energy ministers from European Union countries will on Monday discuss preparations for potential energy supply shocks and measures to shore up gas stocks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

> Earlier this week Germany halted the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, Europe's most divisive energy project, in response to Russia's actions toward Ukraine.

> Russia has since invaded Ukraine, prompting the West to slap further sanctions on Moscow and making the energy supply issue even more pressing.

> ""The events of the past few days have shown us that responsible, forward-looking energy policy is decisive not only for our economy and the environment. It is also decisive for our security,"" Scholz said on Sunday.

> The quicker Germany can expand renewable energy generation, the better, he said.

> In addition, Germany will increase the volume of natural gas in its storage facilities by 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) via long-term options and will buy additional natural gas on world markets in coordination with the European Union, he said.

> Germany has 24 bcm of underground caverns of gas storage, which are currently around 30% full, according to industry group Gas Infrastructure Europe data.

Invasion of a hostile state is always the easiest part of the war, you spearhead your forces into the capital and you have many options in which you can proceed. 1. You surround the city and try to force it to surrender through starvation (siege) though, you must establish air supremacy for this to work because other nations will get involved in airdrops (labelling it as ""Humanitarian aid"") or you 2. Shell/Air raid the city (again, requires air supremacy if you trying to force a surrender.) 3. You invade Kyiv with boots and suffer immense casualties.

I think that going into these talks Russia will be understanding that they have no leverage. If you cannot even invade a territory you have absolutely no chance at occupying it. You cannot establish air supremacy nor superiority: Fact. If you walk into Kyiv you are signing the death warrant of AT LEAST 50k Russian boots: Fact! If you use shock and awe tactics you will not only become war criminals, you will also strengthen the resolve of the remaining Ukrainian populace: Fact! 

Russia is virtually checkmated. They cannot take Kyiv without suffering a horrifying loss of life from their ranks. Kyiv has been preparing for this invasion since 2014, they've had nearly a week to create roadblocks, fortifications, ziplines, choke points, Ied's, molotovs and prep their ambushes. 

Even if Kyiv falls, even if Russia invades the whole of Ukraine, they will never hold it. It will turn into how Vietnam turned into for the U.S. The Ukraine people will never accept Russian rule. If this doesnt end now you are basically giving 100k Russian troops or more an expiration date.

 “I withdrew money at the beginning of all this, and I am going to go search for an ATM again now. Because I want to have a month worth of cash in case there are technical glitches with cards. I already had problems paying for a taxi with Google Pay yesterday,” said Ekaterina, a Moscow resident.

“I believe my bank is not under sanctions, and I doubt my money will disappear altogether, but there is a risk I won’t be able to buy food,” she said. “We simply do not know what to expect of the government. I can’t forecast, so I want cash to be around.”

Bankers are worried about the effect such withdrawals will have on the banking system.

An executive at a western bank in Moscow said: “Their cash withdrawals are harming Russia; the banks’ liquidity is falling.”

Sanctions on the central bank limit its ability for forex interventions, which it had used before to stabilise the rouble and not let it into free float and collapse.

“I cannot even imagine the rouble tomorrow when trading opens up,” the banker said on condition of anonymity. “The central bank will try to support [the rouble; the question is for] how long.

They still don't have air superiority, they haven't encircled Kharkiv or Kyiv, their supply lines are wide open to ambush, and they've lost an enormous amount of manpower and war material. The invaders are having better luck in the south, but even on that front they're having a hard time taking and holding strategic locations. 

Meanwhile Ukraine is receiving intelligence and weapons from NATO. They've assembled an enormous militia to supplement their army, including foreign volunteers. Kyiv is heavily fortified, and morale remains extremely high despite the losses they've no doubt suffered. 

Russia is clearly going to step up their assault on Kyiv in the coming days, but if Ukraine continues to hold the line I don't see how Russia can possibly take the capitol, much less the entire country. Ukraine is huge and most of its population has chosen to fight to the death. 

The longer they hold and the more losses they inflict, the harder this gets for Russia. It's only a matter of time before it gets impossible.",False,1645983991.0,t3_t2sxht,t3_t2sxht,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

4ffaff3dafe3f42d5c179333017ae617,t2sxht,hyo4h0w,"I think there are three big things that Putin miscalculated with this invasion, and it all ties back to his Russian chauvinism that makes him think that everything Russian is strong and every thing not Russian- especially everything Western European- is weak and wimpy.

1. Underestimating the strength, determination, and general badassery of Ukraine- at all levels. The military, the elected leaders, and common people are all united against a foreign invader. I think one of the biggest mistakes that Russia made was not finding a way to cut off internet and cell service from the beginning. The fact that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian forces have been able to control the media narrative of this conflict from the get-go, and in return receive effusive praise and support from the international support. The effect of this messaging on the morale of the ordinary Ukrainian- Ghost of Kyiv, ""Russian warship, go fuck yourself"", ""I don't need a ride, I need ammunition""- what ordinary Ukrainian wouldn't want to do as much as possible in defense of such a homeland? And people say that it is amazing that Zelenskyy, a former comedian, has come out of this so well, but he understands the power of a compelling narrative and a good one-liner. He is controlling the story.
2. Putin ~~underestimated~~ overestimated the preparedness of his own troops. I won't go into this too much, because a lot of other people already are, but this is one of the dangers of autocratic governments. The leader is surrounded by yes-men, and your military's commanding officers are incentivized to lie about their readiness and skim off the top to fulfill their own purses.
3. The biggest thing that Putin miscalculated was the reaction of the EU and the average European citizen. Putin sees the EU as weak and over-reliant on US military aid for their own security. America has reacted exactly as anticipated in this conflict- more sanctions, military aid, and humanitarian support. Putin was prepared for that. But he didn't think that the European leaders would rally together and respond in a way that put their access to Russian gas at risk- Germany specifically. I guarantee that Putin waited until Merkel was out of office before this kicked off, her reputation of strength on the international stage is well known. He didn't think he would get any sort of strong reaction from Scholz. But he also underestimated the response of the average EU citizen- demanding that their democratically elected governments take every action in maximum possible support. After all, Europe and NATO didn't really do much about the Crimea incursion, or Georgia, or Chechnya back in the day. But Europeans certainly care about how this has absolutely shattered the post-WWII Western European conviction that wars are something that can only happen in other places, to other people, and the backlash was more than Putin had reason to expect, given that his previous transgressions resulted in a wrist slap. Putin might have percieve Ukraine in the same Russian chauvinist column of weak post-USSR vassal state, like Georgia and Belarus, but Western Europe sees Ukraine as one of their own.

Anyway, just my two cents on the matter.",1645985137.0,1645984365.0,t3_t2sxht,t3_t2sxht,,0,70,0,70,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

They are not.

On this day in 1943 The Rosenstraße protests began in Berlin.

1,700 Jewish men with non Jewish wives were taken by the Gestapo in Berlin.

The Wives and family members were outraged at the apprehensions, and in a rare occurance in Nazi Germany, took to the streets.

This took place weeks after the disaster at Stalingrad, where 91,000 Germans were lost.

The protesters demanded return of their loved ones, and word quickly began to spread through the depressed reich. 

Soon 6,000 women joined the protests, demanding the return of the men. These women marched for weeks, ignoring the threat of deadly violence from the Reich.

""Within a week, six thousand people had gathered, putting the government in an awkward position because this action led to others like the one in Dortmund-Hörde in April 1943 (the people prevented the arrest of a deserter, shouting “Revolution! Give us back our boys! “) or that of the women of Witten in October of the same year (they rebelled when the local party leader wanted to leave them without a ration card )

Throughout the time that the demonstrations lasted there was only one interruption: it was the night of March 1, 1943, due to a bombing by the RAF. The authorities hoped that this would deter the Mischlinge to stay in their homes but it did not; they returned and in greater numbers, dialectically confronting the SS officers who threatened to open fire (they even placed trucks with machine guns )

Following the disaster in Stalingrad. Reichs minister of propaganda Goebbels,  fearing the double impact of the loss Stalingrad and shooting peaceful protesters (remembering the revolution that took down the Kaiser in 1918). Forbade violence.

The men were released, The vast majority surviving the war.

According to him, if the entire Ukrainian army is destroyed by nuclear strikes, the European part of the Russian Federation itself and Belarus will become unsuitable for life for many years. This is not the price Putin is willing to pay. Arestovich also doubts that Putin's entourage will agree to the use of nuclear weapons: ""It seems to me that even in the case of such a command, there will be a failure somewhere in this chain. For the performers very clearly understand what will follow the execution of such an order - namely, the response of those who themselves possess nuclear weapons.

It appears Russians are now deploying their Western military district forces, meaning the units with the best gear. It's said that out of the 150k Russia has around Ukraine, they have deployed 2/3, so it would appear their starting to send in their better equipped reserves. The early waves were Eastern military district units with armor from the mid 1980s. Ukrainian soldiers joked about the rusting hulks that those BMPs were.

Only in Kyiv did they deploy elite units with modern gear but couldn't bring much heavy armor because of shitty roads from south Belarus. They want to use the highway from Belarus through Chernihiv to Kyiv to bring their best armor but can't take Chernihiv, so their forced to use crappy roads to get to Kyiv that can't take heavy armor. They don't even have enough men in the push to Kyiv to guard their rear, so their columns down to Kyiv keep getting ambushed.

But the world is also showing them the videos of Ukrainian troops taking these soldiers and keeping them safe when captured, getting them help, and so on; those families of the soldiers aren’t going to forget who sent them to die and who sent them to get help.

Ukraine isn’t going after Russian cities right now, they are holding their own territory, it’s purely defensive. Nobody in their right mind is going to believe that the army inside someone else’s city is actually not the aggressor.

Speaking on ABC News on Sunday Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, described Russia’s nuclear deterrence announcement as an example of Putin “manufacturing threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression”.

In televised comments Putin said he had ordered “the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty” due to “aggressive statements” from Nato leaders. Analysts told the Guardian that while the order itself was not immediately clear, it was not indicative of preparation for a first strike.

In response, Psaki said: “At no point has Russia been under threat from Nato, has Russia been under threat from Ukraine, this is all a pattern from President Putin. And we’re going to stand up for it. We have the ability to defend ourselves, but we also need to call out what we’re seeing here from President Putin.”

The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, described the order as indicative of Putin “continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable”. She added in an interview with CBS News: “We have to continue to condemn his actions in ... the strongest possible way.”

On Sunday a number of senior Republicans, including Senator Tom Cotton, a foreign policy hawk, continued to urge Biden to issue a new round of sanctions targeting Russia’s oil and gas exports.

“It’s time for the president and some of our European partners to quit pussy-footing around. The financial sanctions announced last night are riddled with loopholes,” he told ABC News.

The administration has already alluded to further sanctions as the war continues.

Russia and Ukraine is having peace talks.

Russia is only going to offer peace for a positive Russia situation (no leaving Ukraine entirely/letting Ukraine have everything).

Russia expects the peace talks to fall through.

Once they do Russia is going to send everything to invade Kiev in hopes to start to make huge ground and create a puppet government. (They may use this as their bargaining chip- ‘Do X or we’ll send 50k troops in on Kiev’)

I wish that all nuclear arms (in Russia and elsewhere) could be repurposed in existing nuclear power plants to provide clean energy, and that a ban against ever manufacturing such weapons again becomes a reality. Without Russia as a superpower there really isn't much of a reason to keep them around.
Alternately, perhaps one or two such bombs could be kept by the EU or some other entity that has proven consistently levelheaded to be able to handle that responsibility, but certainly not the US.

It is the norm in military planning to develop a range of plans from ""small"" to ""large"" each associated with various degrees of difficulty. So it seems based on the current situation that there were 4 plans sorted by difficulty

1. Capture the Donetsk and Luhask regions (small).
2. Land bridge to Crimea
3. Take control of all Russian speaking areas (Kharviv to Odessa)
4. Full invasion of Ukraine (large)

Based on the current situation on the ground, it seems the military was really only planning to do the first two with the other forces as dummies (towards Kyiv and Kharviv). Putin probably at the last minute jumped from 2 to 4 and that can explain the almost comic level of unpreparedness that the northern attacks (like running out of fuel) face in comparison to the Southern attacks (which overall seemed much more disciplined and it somewhat close to achieving their objectives).

But fact is that Putin has taken their power away, and is using that power now to kill innocent people. What Putin is doing, he is doing in the name of Russia and the Russian people. He can only do this because he has stolen the power from the people, because he has suppressed them and dispirited them through years of propaganda and violence, which has caused the Russians (in some cases) to go into a form of mute acceptance, a survival mode to just let it be and get on with their lives. 

And that is honestly an OK choice when all he is doing is enriching himself and his friends. But now by allowing Putin to stay in power, by avoiding the difficult fight and all that it costs in their own country, they are intrinsically shifting that fight to the Ukranians. The Ukranians now have to fight because the Russian's aren't. 

So ultimately, while it is certainly not the fault of the Russian people, they do bear some responsibility, and I hope they can be courageous enough to act on that responsibility. Many people are already, by protesting despite the threat of arrest, and it is very inspiring to see. I hope more join them.

Again, it's easy for me to say - I am not in those circumstances and I don't know how I would act if I were in their stead. But that doesn't change the fact, that by keeping their heads down, the violence is being passed to the Ukranians - and that is not fair.",False,1645986517.0,t3_t2sxht,t1_hyo8c56,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Fun facts. Pakistan was consistented of Western and Eastern halves, the Muslim majority areas separated by India, even though East Pakistanis (Bengalis) and West Pakistanis (Punjabis, Sindhis, etc.) have completely different cultures. I guess in 1947, somehow making a country this way made sense. Except when the military dictator of Pakistan, Yahya Khan decided to go all genocide on East Pakistan. Did I mention  that Pakistan was a US ally, and Nixon aided and abetted Pakistani war crimes?

The US threatened India to not intervene, forcing India and Russia to sign a friendship treaty if the US attacked India.

Pakistan's brutality in East Pakistan eventually caused a refugee crisis in India because Indira Gandhi opened the borders. India eventually did invade, along with Bengali freedom fighters, and forced the Pakistani Army to surrender. I believe Nixon retaliated by calling Indira Gandhi a bitch.

From what I've read it's primarily supply chain and secondarily how fit the Russian army is in the first place.  Regarding supply chain, they may have actually been straining their fuel and food supplies *even while amassed in Russia*, so all the delays caused by Biden leaking their plans to invade may have had a huge effect in causing Russia to bleed supplies.  Putin was then at a do or die moment of no return; he had to either go forward with his plan or pack it up.  Once again, Biden continued to warn his belief that invasion was imminent.

Second, the Russian army as absolute shit, underpaid, no moral, shit old equipment, and full of corruption that has the effect of overestimating their strength and hiding how absolute shit they are.

edit: the third thing is related to #2: believing your own propaganda.  Russia says its army is strong and ready- it's not, far from it.  Putin was also saying 'Ukraine isn't really a country, they have no identity, really they should be a part of the Russian people, they won't mind if we come, in fact they'll be glad to have us.'

Previously, you had to do an international account-to-account bank transfer that was less familiar to most people. Now it's basically the same as any other online donation.

Not every element of the page gets auto-translated, so:

* **Сума** = total amount (to donate)
* **Збір коштів на потреби армії України** = Fundraising for the needs of the Army of Ukraine (basically the transaction memo)
* **Номер картки** = card number
* **Термін дії** = expiration date
* **Натискаючи на кнопку «Сплатити», Ви приймаєте Угоду користувача** = By clicking on the ""Pay"" button, you accept the User Agreement

Be sure to **select the right currency** from the dropdown box. By default it's set to the Ukrainian currency. Most people will probably want USD (US Dollars) or EUR (Euros).

You also have the option to donate in Rubles, but I don't think that's worth much nowadays.

Where the conflict may be heading exactly isn’t clear, but the short-term market implications are. “The near-term consequences for markets are relatively simple,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist for the research firm Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Energy prices will keep rising, and equities will keep falling

The stock market during the Cold War
The Russian hostilities in Ukraine could be the start of something much bigger: a geopolitical shift that plunges the world into a 21st-century version of the Cold War. But even if that’s the case, the hard numbers suggest that the financial implications for prudent, diversified investors who live far from immediate danger zones may not be all that severe

The Cold War was destructive and debilitating for vast populations, but it was an excellent period for stock investors. Even during recessions and regional wars, the Dow Jones industrial average turned in an outstanding performance.

Here are the numbers, which I calculated over the long Presidents’ Day weekend:

From President Truman’s March 17, 1948, speech to Congress criticizing what he called the Soviet Union’s expansion of Communism in Eastern Europe, until the end of December, 1991, when the Soviet Union ceased to exist, the Dow returned 10.05 percent, annualized. In the roughly 30 years since then, through Friday, the Dow returned 10.77 percent, annualized, a bit better than during the Cold War, but not by much.

(Insert long section here about gas and oil prices that was good but I’m clipping to answer the specific question, will post if wanted)

Hedge your bets
The economic damage caused by the conflict could spiral in unexpected ways. “The biggest danger, of course, is the unintended consequences that we’re bound to see,” Mr. Morse said.

Economics aside, Russia’s grievances with the West have already led to a partial rapprochement with China. If that evolves into a strong alliance, it would shift the balance of global power in a direction that generations of Western strategists have tried to prevent.

“This crisis is a trip back to the future,” Ian Bremmer, president and founder of the risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group, said in a video conversation from the Munich Security Conference last week. Russia’s actions have moved the world closer to a great-power military conflict than at any time since the end of the Soviet Union. of Western strategists have tried to prevent.

The possibility of a confrontation between NATO forces and Russia, with its nuclear arsenal, raises the risks of the Ukraine crisis beyond rational calculation.

Even so, the markets will perform those calculations anyway.

History tells us that the worse things get, the more valuable cash and Treasuries seem. And it also says that Cold Warriors who stuck with the stock market ended up with big fat portfolios.

When you're flying in an airplane (or drone), you are higher up, so the horizon is further out. But even at maximum height (ie: satellite orbit), the horizon will block out some of your view.

IIRC, at typical flying heights, the horizon is 300 miles out. Meaning, to launch an attack from an airplane to anybody, you need to get at least within 300 miles of them. Otherwise, the curvature of the earth itself blocks you (let alone mountains, hills, valleys, buildings, trees or other kinds of cover).

If they're in an urban environment, well, even harder. Buildings block the way, and even if you shove a 1000-lb bomb into the attack, the building probably won't move.

---------

If you're talking about closer strikes, the other issue is that Russians have anti-air of their own. So they are likely shooting down the remains of Ukraine's air force as they attempt to strike high value targets. Still though, the Ukrainian air force has done as good a job as any, and is punching far above its weight class.

If you're talking about simpler drone attacks (ie: the ISIS-style ""suicide drone into Syria"" attack), those are called Javelin missiles and they've killed hundreds of tanks already. A Javelin missile is a point-and-shoot missile that travels at 500mph and blows itself up on a tank automatically.

b88de01e892c4fb5e3e043d1c8ff05aa,t2sxht,hyodk6b,"Yanukovich was a Russian puppet. He was groomed by Paul Manafort, the American felon convicted of operating as a foreign agent after being implicated in the 2016 Russian election interference in the US Presidential election.

A number of the Berkut special police forces that murdered over 100 protestors in the Euromaidan protests either defected to the breakaway regions in the east or, in the case of Sergei Kusyuk, took a command position in the Russian Interior Ministry’s OMON special police force. Unmarked Russian soldiers (the so-called Little Green Men) appeared in the east of Ukraine along with Russian military equipment almost immediately after Yanukovich left Ukraine. He famously fled directly to Moscow.

This illustrates a concerted Russian occupation in Ukraine since at least 2014, but the history of Russian aggression against Ukraine reaches as far back as the 1930s, when 4,000,000 Ukrainians were starved in the Soviet manufactured famine now known as the Holodomor. 

Beyond this, the grey area in this matter is intentionally designed as a form of diplomatic shithousery. Much in the same way this invasion is occurring in the same month as Russia’s tenure as president of the UN Security Council to allow the country to avoid official condemnation by simply vetoing resolutions to do so, obfuscating the true nature of the occupation of the east of Ukraine reduces conversation around it to semantics of what ‘occupation’ really means. 

Occupation is outlined in The Hague Convention of 1907 and technically the *current* Russian invasion meets few of those definitions. However, we can infer geopolitical shithousery by looking at the condition that occupations cannot technically occur in sovereign territory. 

Proxy financing of the initial secession and subsequent ‘fair elections’ overseen solely by these Russian-backed separatists provides legal cover for allowing unmarked troops in ‘their’ territory. Russia’s recognition of this ‘sovereignty’ on an international level allows them to sign ‘defense pacts’ with what is essentially their own proxy to allow them to occupy Ukraine’s territory publicly without being technically defined as an occupier.

Geopolitical shithousery.

Yes some nukes are kept in static silos. These are usually in the interior of the country (believe a lot of US nukes are in Wyoming and Kansas, IIRC) so that if a launch from Russia (or China) is detected they can be launched out of the silo in retaliation before the original launcher's nukes arrive.

Nukes are also sometimes kept on trucks/military vehicles. They are mobile and can hide to launch.

Nukes are also kept on bomber aircraft. They can be up in the air before the nukes hit (they are also usually in the interior of a country). Sometimes during heightened crisis (like now) there may be some aircraft armed with nukes already in the air. 

Nukes are also kept on submarines. They are also highly mobile.

It's way more complicated than just taking out Russia's silos.

The rocket launcher was considered a bad idea in practice, because it didn't have enough range and the two soldiers who used the weapon would die. USA modified the weapon to be a single 50lb briefcase by the 1960s with a timer.

The military was worried about the reliability of the timer, so the also gave the nuke a 100 meter pull cord for detonation. Yeah... Good thing this thing was never actually used.

These Javelin missiles are like 25 lbs for the rocket + 25 lbs for the launcher, so a single soldier can use them. Half the weight of the smallest nuke ever.

The ultimate end to the Davy Crockett nuke was it's final modification as artillery ammo. Artillery can shoot a 100lb projectile 40 miles away, so it was the perfect use of the warhead.

I think people are referring to the sanctions. In 2014, the Russians had estimated that a SWIFT cutoff would cost them 5% of their GDP. Some of the other sanctions (the freezing of foreign reserves? the sanctions on the banks?) were also thought to cost them about 5% of GDP, each time because it limits their trade or their ability to give money to their people. By comparison, the great depression had a 30% drop of GDP over 4 years.

Today it has been reported there is a bank run. Any bank that has a bank run instantly becomes insolvent: it goes bankrupt and cannot give people their money back. This erases the bank accounts of a lot of normal people. Also, people can't get money to buy groceries. Furthermore, bank runs are contagious: because banks make loans to each other, if one bank becomes insolvent and cannot pay back what it owes to other banks, the other banks also become insolvent, etc... This ""sort of"" happened in the 2008 financial crisis that followed the American housing crisis. In that case, the US and EU governments broke the cycle of contagion (=bank bankruptcies) by bailing them out (the federal banks essentially printed money and gave it to the bailed out banks who were sustaining bank runs). However, if the Russian bank runs out of money, or can't print Rubles anymore (see below), then the Russian bank can't bail out their own banks.

The Ruble is plummeting. In normal times, this has good and bad effects. In normal times, a factory owner pays salaries in Rubles, so the factory owner would make more money on exports sold in $, but if there's sanctions and you can't export, you can't take advantage of this. The disadvantage of a weak Ruble is that your imported cars, computers, microwave ovens and so on, increase in price correspondingly. Normal people won't be able to buy good western cars anymore.

If hyperinflation sets in like in Zimbabwe, the Ruble will cease to exist, and ordinary Russians will only accept $ (""dollarization""). In that situation, the Russian government loses the ability to print money, a situation called ""original sin"" in economics, because it can have dire consequences down the road. For example, if Rubles don't exist anymore, then bank runs can't be prevented because you can't bail them out. Also, if the Ruble still exists but is too weak, it becomes impossible to bail out your own banks if their debt is in $.

Actually, even if the Ruble doesn't collapse completely, ""original sin"" is already in play because Russia has been banned from credit markets abroad.",1645988371.0,1645987355.0,t3_t2sxht,t1_hyoabvs,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Say that you're a Russian company, and you want Taiwanese computer chips. The Taiwanese company doesn't want rubles. They want Taiwanese dollars. Meanwhile, Russian companies don't want Taiwanese dollars for the goods that *they* manufacture; they want rubles.

In between is some banking. Russian banks offer access to Russian markets by selling rubles, which which you can buy Russian goods. Taiwanese banks offer access to Taiwanese markets by selling Taiwanese dollars, with which you can buy Taiwanese goods. Done seamlessly enough, you don't see any of this; you just pay Russian rubles for Taiwanese chips. But there's a big process going on behind the scenes to convert currency back and forth.

What if every bank in the West told the Russian banks, ""We're not buying your rubles for any price?"" There's now a big problem. You, a Russian company, have lots of rubles, but you can't actually buy any foreign goods with them. And you can't sell any of your goods to foreigners because nobody will buy rubles to do business with you. You're confined to the domestic market.

---

Exacerbating this is the knowledge from citizens that since there's now much less demand for rubles, rubles are now worth much less. This means that every citizen wants to dump their rubles to some other idiot, for any price, and buy something else with it. And since their *bank balances* are in rubles, that means that everyone wants to withdraw all of their money from their bank accounts. That's called a bank run, and it's very bad - banks almost always lend out deposits, so they don't actually have enough money on hand to pay out all depositors. This exacerbates the bank run, which scares people even more, which makes them more desperate to dump rubles for any price, which collapses the currency even more...",False,1645988269.0,t3_t2sxht,t1_hyoabvs,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

What Russia is doing is extremely sloppy and uncoordinated by comparison and the only reason its worked as well as it has so far is that they have multiple ways of attacking positions from long-range positions via balistic missiles and rocket systems.

Currently, their economy is smaller than the size of Texas and close to the size of Spain. Investing in the future in the way you described wouldn’t be enough to grow their economic power to compete with the rest of the world. In fact, their economic power is going to decline even more based on the future trends. Right now what makes them a super power is their military and monopoly on oil/gas in that region. Most of the energy from Europe comes directly from Russia which gives them significant influence. If a west aligned Ukraine became a significant competitor they would be absolutely fucked. Their influence would drop dramatically because the west could get their resources from someone else.

I think you overestimate how much the west cares. We did nothing when they annexed Crimea and nothing when they invaded Georgia. Yes we don’t like what they’re doing, but we are not willing to risk a end of world scenario unless there’s no other option. They thought invading Ukraine would be easy and straight forward, but Ukraine has shocked them and the world with not only their will to fight, but their ability to galvanize support diplomatically.

The knowledge of the soldiers on day 1 of the actual invasion ranged from ""none"" to ""training exercise"" to ""fighting Nazis in Donbass"" all of which start to become obviously not true rather immediately. Some higher ups know the score but they seem to be making their own calls on what to tell their soldiers so that's further confusion.

It's unclear what Putin actually thinks or knows. It's unclear what information his advisors actually gave him. But at the least it seems unlikely that he expected the current invasion to go so slowly, and expected the sanctions to be much lighter.

Anyone with a sane, stable head and proper information about Ukraine and those territories wouldn't have started this fight in the first place. Maybe, *maybe* could have gotten away with annexing the ""separated"" regions if that was their sole focus, like with Crimea. But that's not what Putin decided to do, so clearly he is thinking or believing something that is not accurate. It's why what happens next is impossible to predict, because maybe Putin does order massive destruction of Ukrainian cities in the hopes it will demoralize Ukranians. Maybe he escalates to nukes in the hopes it will shake the west into acquiescence. Neither of those things are true but he might think they're possible, and when looking at utter failure and crippling your own power, possible starts to look like a way out. There's mention of just throwing full Russian manpower at it which would be hard for Ukraine to stop for long, *if* the Russian military stops sabotaging itself because many of them don't want to be there.",False,1645987078.0,t3_t2sxht,t1_hyo4uxq,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

# The behavioral model and game theory

>  The rational choice theory is based on this idea that people rationally pursue goals for increasing their personal interests. Here, we present a new concept of rational choice as a hyper-rational choice in which the actor thinks about profit or loss of other actors in addition to his personal profit or loss and then will choose an action that is desirable to him. We implement the hyper-rational choice to generalize and expand the game theory. Results of this study will help to model the behavior of people considering environmental conditions, the type of behavioral interaction, valuation system of itself and others, and system of beliefs and internal values of societies. Hyper-rationality helps us understand how human decision-makers behave in interactive decisions.

2: When the Allies launched Operation Market Garden they assumed their ground forces could meet up in time with their paratroopers. The ground forces were unable to meet up with the paratroopers and they got killed and/or Captured becuese of it.

What did Russia do? They sent Paratroopers to capture airfield's and hoped their ground forces could meet up with them to hold out until they could airlift in more troops and supply's. That didn't work and they got killed and/or Captured becuese of it.
