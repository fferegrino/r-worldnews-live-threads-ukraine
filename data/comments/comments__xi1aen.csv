Day 208 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was finally the day where they didn’t fire any missiles at us, the night turned out to be quiet as well. But in the morning, at 8am, they shelled Derhachi which is very close to Kharkiv, so we heard the explosions from here. And they also remotely mined it, apparently from an UAV, though I’m not sure if there are drones with that capability. They do have Zemledeliye remote mining system, but it only has a range of 15km max, and Derhachi is 25km away from the border. 

Today it was a bit less quiet than yesterday, not counting those explosions in Derhachi in the morning, at around 9pm explosions were heard, but there’s no info about where they were coming from. At the same time there were some photos with a fire somewhere, but apparently it wasn’t from shelling/missiles. And speaking of missiles, it looks like they haven’t fired any of them at us today either or at least we don’t know about any of them being launched from Belgorod.

It’s funny that those fake LPR and DPR now suddenly started saying that they need to do a referendum to become a part of Russia immediately. They are definitely scared of losing Luhansk oblast, but just a couple of days ago they were saying that there’s no reason to panic. It’s not like those referendums would even do anything, it won’t stop our forces from liberating them. They don’t really care about Belgorod or Crimea being shelled, but somehow Luhansk and Donetsk would be crossing the line?

Some people correctly point out that the west would respond, likely with their own nukes or joining the conflict directly, and even countries that have supported/remained neutral like Turkey/Iran/China/India would sanction Russia if they used nukes.

Not all of these tanks are immediately suitable for use in Ukraine, but in order to equip one Ukrainian tank brigade with combat-ready equipment, at least about 90 tanks should be found at first.

Russians have a new bridge over Dnipro river at Nova Kakhovka. Already a week ago I remember they started preparing something at that area. As the tweet mentions this is a very difficult crossing to disable for Ukraine. So close to the dam meaning needs a very precise hit at certain angle, the gap is very small so all it takes is to lay 1 mobile bridge (they were transporting them few days ago towards Nova Kakhova). Even if Ukraine manages to hit it likely won't now take long for Russians to make a new bridge. May not be worth wasting long range missiles for this.

I think this is the thing that Girkin meant when he said last week how Russians had ""solved the river crossing issue"".",1663598325.0,1663597263.0,t3_xi1aen,t3_xi1aen,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

That's all changed. The state is NATO and EU aligned and has the military power to provide security to its people. EU economic and political integration will continue while Russian Eu integration is being destroyed.

In 2014, there were 3 main people groups in Crimea—(1)Russian-speaking Ukrainians, (2) Russians, and (3) Tatars.  

(1) The first group had mixed feelings about Russia seizing control.   *Group A—supporters*: Those who welcomed it did so for two reasons—first, economical, they thought that since Russia doesn’t have a beach front, and desperately wants one, that this would be like an enormous resort peninsula, that billions would be made, essentially like Florida.  They thought that could get money to invest, and it would be basically thousands and thousands of square miles of shorefront that could be developed to be like Florida towns—a get rich quick, everyone wins scheme—so that would have thousands of new hotels and full beaches.  (Didn’t happen.  Russians who can afford luxury prefer going to Europe, Dubai, etc.  and also, Crimea turned into a ‘military state.’)
The other reason some welcomed it was that people there watched more Russian television than Ukrainian—because russian television is *in Russian.* It brainwashed them to be accepting, just like Fox News /MAGA.

*Group B—opposers*: The Russian-speaking Ukrainians opposed to Russia, mostly left in 2014 and after.

(2) Sticking with the Crimea has been like Florida theme—it’s a haven for retirees; and the retirees are Russians.  See, Ukraine has lots of coast.  While Russia—more populated, less coast—and what they have, much is inhabitated by Muslim ethnicities (in the south).  Russians frequently retired to Crimea.  Also Crimea is full of sketchy businessmen.  And, had a lax government, very open to corruption.  Even though was ukrainian, it was dominated by a constant influx of Russians—business owners, retirees, Russians who just want to live by the beach—and had been like this for 40 years.  Over time, an enormous chunk of the population had Russian passports—either dual holders, or just solely Russian.  Sorta like what percentage of south Florida was born in south Florida? (Like palm beach—full of retirees—same, but all were russian.)

After 2014, floodgates opened and thousands of Russians moved to Crimea every month.

(3) The third group, the Tatar people—they’re opposed to Russians.  But they’re not really all that involved.  They’re a minority who’ve been mistreated (historically, by Russians), and they primarily stay inland in small towns, try to keep their heads down.  They don’t get very involved in politics, especially now since Russia has started repressing them again, find excuses to arrest and prosecute them, but can be rallied.

*So when you ask*, **people in Crimea**, *who do you mean??*

The Russians?—Bc they’re now by far the majority there.  The Tatars?  They’re not as uninvolved as Amish people... but they’re staying quiet because the repression continues.  

The remaining Ukrainian passport-holder?  There’s very few!  It’s just not the case that you’ll find people in Crimea who’ve families have lived there for multiple generations—it’s totally dominated by newcomers, settlers basically.  Almost all pro-Ukrainians moved.

*Sidenote: there is/was also clusters of ethnic Greek people; but I don’t know if they opposed (and left) or supported Russia.  I know that the Greek population in Mariupol is split, with half supporting Russia, half not.*",1663562916.0,1663561637.0,t3_xi1aen,t3_xi1aen,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Zelensky has been non-stop excellent and their army has been incredible fighting off a much bigger force whilst they built up arms. 

Having said that there are other reasons for my support. If Ukraine falls Russia will become richer and all of the ex-soviet countries would be taken once again, unwilling hostages to Moscow's whims, rules and kleptomania. It would mark the rise of a malicious super-power. Unfortunately political corruption spreads like a disease. So it would not only be that block which would be riven by corruption but other countries would take inspiration, ideas and evil confidence in their own - 'we are not as bad as Russia' or 'everyone else is corrupt'. And so misery would spread almost like the forces of Mordor throughout the global system. 

If you are perhaps a little skeptical, then we can look at the example of the criminal Trump. He refused to accept the election results, and so many other Republicans in their upcoming elections say they will reject a negative result as well. In the UK, if a prime minister was caught maliciously lying it would lead to a resignation, but after Trump, Boris got away with many things, and it seemed to be the mendacity of Trump that paved the way.

Understanding historical conflicts it sometimes helps to separate ""tactical warfare"" from ""strategic warfare"".  Think of them as two separate games.  In the strategic war Ukraine is shooting at Russia's army and Russians are shooting artillery at Ukraine's army (Russians are shooting at more than just army, which was probably bad strategy and certainly unethical but that is separate topic).  It may not matter much where along the front the shooting takes place.  What matters is that the munitions and artillery pieces are there.  If you do not make attacks your opponent's infantry spread out.  Most of the shells just blow up dirt or cause problems for future farmers.  It looks exactly like seizing ground for some tactical reason.  Taking the ground forces the enemy to concentrate to take it back or concentrate to defend it.  The 21'st century western model is to ""attack"" in order identify where targets are located but that is strategically the same thing.  

If you destroy enough enemy or drain enough ammunition the front can become unstable and fluid.  At that point it switches back to tactics and geography.    Even that statement is debatable.  The breakthrough is just a way to leverage the effectiveness of your ammunition because you can target the enemy where they are not fortified and cut up their supply lines.  Cutting their supplies prevents their strategic activity.  

Both sides are pouring ammunition into the front.  At no point does it make sense for a Russian colonel or general to decide to stop fighting.  Stockpiling ammunition just creates traffic jambs and depot targets.  Worse (from Russia's perspective, great for Ukraine) it might leave a depot for Ukraine to capture.

> The leadership culture is dictatorial and enforced by fear. [...] Fear of punishment has created a military in which soldiers will doggedly implement orders even when they no longer make sense.

> There is a limited career path for long-term soldiers. This leads to retention problems that have caused the Russian military to continue to depend upon conscripts.

> With a rapidly ageing population, Russia lacks young recruits.  The low standard of living in much of the country produces troops unfamiliar with much modern technology.

> Moreover, in the absence of any clear ideology or strong leadership in units, troops are largely unmotivated, do not work effectively as teams and are unwilling to risk their lives for one another. The Russian infantry have therefore lacked offensive combat power.

> Perhaps one of the greatest weaknesses of the country’s military system, though, is training. First, it simply does not do enough of it. [...]  Second, Russian soldiers tend to receive training that is narrowly bounded to their assigned task. [...] Third, the Russians do most of their training in their units.

Ukrainian military officials maintained their operational silence regarding the progress of Ukrainian operations in southern Ukraine on September 19, noting Russian forces continued efforts to improve their defensive positions.[14]

Ukrainian sources reported on continued Ukrainian strikes on Russian rear areas and lines of communication.[15] Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian ammunition depots in Mykolayiv Oblast (likely near frontline positions), two unspecified command posts, and a Russian electronic warfare system in Kherson City.[16] Geolocated social media footage confirmed a Ukrainian missile strike against a Russian barracks in Kherson City on September 18.[17] Odesa Military Administration Spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk reported that Ukrainian forces destroyed two Russian ammunition depots in Blahodatne (northwest of Kherson City) and in Kherson City itself on September 18.[18] Satellite imagery and local reporting confirmed continued Russian efforts to repair damage to ground lines of communication (GLOCs) inflicted by Ukrainian strikes. Satellite imagery released on September 19 depicted Russian operations to repair damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam from September 16-18, after Ukrainian strikes partially collapsed the bridge over the dam on September 2.[19]

Ukrainian and Russian sources identified three areas of kinetic activity on September 19: northwest of Kherson City, near the Ukrainian bridgehead over the Inhulets River, and in northern Kherson Oblast near Olhine. Russian milbloggers reported that the frontline did not change northwest of Kherson City on September 19, and Ukrainian official sources reported that Ukrainian forces consolidated their tactical positions along the front.[20] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces repelled Ukrainian attacks near Shchaslyve and Bezimenne (in the Davydiv Brid bridgehead), but ISW cannot verify these reports.[21] A Russian milblogger also claimed that high water levels in the Inhulets River due to Russian strikes on dams upriver are impeding Ukrainian forces' ability to support forward positions.[22] Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that Ukrainian troops repelled Russian reconnaissance groups in the Arkhanhelske (northern Kherson Oblast) region.[23] Geolocated social media footage separately confirmed the presence of Wagner private military company fighters in Arkhanhelske on September 19.[24]

Official Ukrainian forces reported several Russian strikes on Mykolayiv City and the surrounding areas on September 19.[32] Ukraine’s Southern Operational Command reported that six S-300 missiles and three Smerch (MLRS) rockets struck industrial and civilian facilities in Mykolayiv City on September 19.[33] Local city authorities reported that the Russian strikes damaged several buildings and a segment of the city tram network.[34]",False,1663643424.0,t3_xi1aen,t1_ip4xtty,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

It was also a foregone conclusion they were better with Ukraine without even accounting for Ukraine's new alliances or financial aid.  Which isn't enough, by the way.

Crimea's economy is centered around tourism and fishing, neither of which can exist in a state of war.  Its only opportunities for population growth are tied to a water source Ukraine controlled and will likely control again.  If Russia wins their tourism will be strictly domestic and their fishing is still fucked because the sea has been mined to shit and large swathes of wildlife have been killed.

Russia is still firing its artillery like crazy, but all the work Ukraine has done disrupting logistics is starting to bite. Russia has definitely scaled back artillery fire in some regions due to ammunition shortages.

Other issues seem to be brewing for Russian artillery. There's definitely issues with barrels wearing out but a lack of replacements taking place, either because there are none or because they can't move them to where they're needed due to nonexistent communication. Also talk that Russia's supposedly unlimited supply of shells is anything but, and that they are into old stockpiles with high dud rates. There's also been a lot of discussion about the declining quality of Russian artillery crews to basically untrained random guys working the guns. Finally, it seems like Ukrainian counter battery fire is improving, so more Russian guns are getting wiped out as they fire, further exacerbating all operational and manpower issues.

In short, Russia continues to have massive artillery firepower but it's rapidly transitioning from effective if inefficient grid square erasure style saturation barrages to just becoming this totally inaccurate source of random explosive terror at varying and unpredictable volumes of fire. It's degraded but that isn't necessarily a good thing.

The puppet governments in those areas are asking for referenda, which will poll the heavily depleted local population as most have been evacuated West, and the resident numbers inflated with Russians shipped in to areas under more established Russian occupation.

That's assuming that the polls are genuine at all, which is a huge assumption.

Any referenda that take place will not be recognised by anyone other than Russia and a few of their absolute puppet states like the CAR. It's meaningless and mostly for internal Russian consumption.

The only danger is that they use it to spin justification for escalation because Ukraine would be attacking ""Russian"" soil, so they could try and upsell mobilisation or something like tactical nuclear weapons, both of which are in their published doctrine for defending the Russian homeland.

Neither would help Russia's situation and I'm not sure they could actually sell either to their own people now either. It would just change the scale of Russia's defeat and the collateral damage.

Russians do their fake referendums and annex LDPR, then claim Ukraine is attacking their territory and declare mobilisation. 
Or they hope Ukraine will stop, lol.

After mobilisation they will have more meat for defensive positions, just dig thousands of miles of trenches and tanks become obsolete.

The war slows down this winter, it will not become active again in the next years. No deal, no agreement. Russia attempts to rebuild its army while still doing some rocket attacks on civilian targets.


Optimistic take is:

By the next spring:
Ukraine mounts some new counter offensives, Russians flee Kherson leaving or destroying a lot of equipment. Zaporizhie (southern front) is cut in 2, land bridge between Donbass and Crimea is cut off.

Now it’s really hard to tell what would happen after this, it could either be the pessimistic take all over again, or complete collapse of russian army and their withdrawal to Crimea in the south and russia in the east, meaning DPR/LPR will cease to exist, but no clue about Crimea.",1663623438.0,1663623191.0,t3_xi1aen,t1_ip4549j,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

It comes down to what I call institutional inertia. Organizations, governments, companies, societies all have a sort of inertia, a resistance to changing things once they're set in place. The larger the group, or the longer they've been doing it, the more resistance to change there will be. It doesn't make it impossible it just makes it harder and take longer.

The USSR spent 70 years hammering away at the idea of Western ideals being their enemy. And Putin is reviving that rhetoric right now as we sit here on Reddit. Their society already has a lot of inertia and they haven't even started tapping the breaks yet. The fact of the matter is it will take generations before the Russia people will be ready to change. Time I don't think they really have. 

Individuals might of course, even demographics within Russia, but their society as a whole is locked in and it's going to be a long time before they can change direction. To everyone's detriment.",False,1663634875.0,t3_xi1aen,t1_ip4t5it,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Ukraine can’t and won’t take back Crimea by force.  Doing so would require evacuating the Tatar prior—as they’re an ally and are innocent—and they will not go.  Their negative, painful history means they aren’t budging.  Plus, Russia wouldn’t let them go anywhere, anyways.  

Which leaves regaining Crimea thru negotiations.  This requires a change of regime in Russia, or a situation that Russia is in such dire straights that it will willingly cede any claims to the territory—because it has said it will use nukes to defend it. 

And even of Russia agrees to cede control of Crimean territory, dismantle the bridge, remove the additional ports and bases—there’s still like 15 reasons it’s still a mess—there’s actual legitimate legal questions over the lease of that naval base.   And I can’t imagine Ukraine sees the continuation of the lease—which was voided for nonpayment. Or voided bc hostile takeover. Or voided bc “treason” (least legally viable argument)—as possible going forward.  Which means Russia would have to give up Crimea, and a major port they’ve had for 100 years, and all this is enforced without Ukraine having a navy—Ukraine could not have enough carrot or stick to get Russia to do this.  It would require a third party to be party—like US or UK or EU—and has to be things so great that Russia is salivating puddles to get—like immediate retraction of all sanctions—but Russia isn’t there yet.

I don't think it had much to do with Red Sea access; as much as it did to oil deposit access. 

Then again, the Iran-Iraq war was also about Red Sea access, at first. (along with the weaponized shia-vs-sunni conflict).

McConnell’s Russian Issues

McConnell Refused to Agree to Warn the Public About Russian Interference in the 2016 Election
During the 2016 campaign, McConnell refused to sign a bipartisan statement warning the public of Russia’s attempts to influence the election. McConnell thought it was a ‘political play’ by the Democrats. See Biden: McConnell Refused To Sign Bipartisan Statement On Russian Interference from NPR. Before the election, the polls pointed to an almost certain win for Hillary Clinton. Considering this fact, why would the Democrats need to make a ‘political play’ for this election? Was McConnell just incredibly paranoid, or was there something more to his failure to warn the public?


McConnell Has Blocked Election Security Legislation to Protect the Nation From Foreign Interference in Future Elections

McConnell recently blocked two bills that could have protected our elections from foreign interference. These bills were introduced shortly after Robert Mueller testified to Congress that Russia is planning to interfere with the 2020 election. McConnell even blocked a measure that only required that any candidate or campaign official report to the FBI any offers of assistance from foreign governments. See McConnell Blocks Two Election Security Bills from The Hill.

Oleg Deripaska and His Kentucky Factory

Oleg Deripaska was a key player in the Mueller Report. Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, was giving secret briefings to Deripaska on the American elections. Many believe that this information was going back to Putin and Russian Intelligence agencies. Recently, sanctions were lifted on Deripaska in a controversial move by the Republican-led Senate. Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, was a key advocate for the lifting of these sanctions. Shortly after the lifting of sanctions, it was announced that Deripaska’s company would be making a $200,000,000.00 investment by opening an aluminum facility in Kentucky. Mitch McConnell is the senior Senator from Kentucky. Was this a $200,000,000.00 campaign contribution? Yes, in an indirect way. See Sanctioned Russian Oligarch’s Company to Invest Millions in New Aluminum Plant in Mitch McConnell’s State from Newsweek Magazine for more on the McConnell-Deripaska connection. See this very interesting story, A Kremlin-Linked Firm Invested Millions in Kentucky. Were They After More Than Money?, from Time Magazine for the latest on McConnell and Deripaska.

This investment in rural Kentucky by a Russian oligarch tied to the Kremlin is very interesting when a recent Pentagon white paper, Russian Strategic Intentions, is considered. See the second paragraph on page 23 of the report (page 39 on the PDF numbering). It reads as follows:
Hybrid tactics are most effective when the target state has lost the will or capacity to resist. Conversely, countries that do not have these vulnerabilities face little threat from Russian adventurism short of full-scale war. The most prevalent indicators or “signposts” that an entity is vulnerable to Russian hybrid actions include political and social turmoil, large Russian investments in its key capabilities, and weak security structures.

The paper is about 150 pages long. It gives a lot of space to ‘gray zone’ operations by Russians. These ‘gray zone’ operations or ‘hybrid actions’ as mentioned above include influence operations such as the recent Russian election meddling. Another way to influence politics within a country is to have economic clout within the country. One way of developing economic clout is to invest in employing the citizens of the country. This is exactly what Deripaska has done in Kentucky.
Notice these ‘signposts’ that a country is vulnerable to Russian influence operations. We have political turmoil and social turmoil in the US. 

We have severe economic distress in the section of Kentucky where Deripaska just happened to invest. McConnell just happens to be blocking security against Russian influence operations in 2016 and 2020. McConnell is the poster-child for Russian influence. He is political turmoil personified. He blocks funding for programs that could relieve economic distress in regions such as Appalachia. Economic distress often leads to social turmoil.

McConnell welcomes Russian investment even to the extent of removing sanctions against a person, Deripaska, that has been connected to election interference in 2016. If McConnell had wanted the American government to make a small loan for this company ($200 million is a small amount of money for our government), he could have gotten this through Congress. But no, McConnell would rather use his power in the Senate to get Russian investment in his state at the expense of the security of the nation.

Unlike Trump, McConnell is not a useful idiot for the Russians. McConnell had disdain for the American government from the time he arrived in the Senate in the 1980s. McConnell’s hatred for American political norms showed when he expressed his outrage at the Democrats’ failure to confirm Nixon’s hero in the Saturday Night Massacre as a Supreme Court Justice.",False,1663588807.0,t3_xi1aen,t1_ip1wdst,,3,20,0,20,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Actually he said that he was: 

> There is no way out. We **must** de-occupy the territory. It **may happen** that Crimea will be returned by diplomatic means

Emphasis mine.

> Ukraine can’t and won’t take back Crimea by force.  Doing so would require evacuating the Tatar prior—as they’re an ally and are innocent—and they will not go.  Their negative, painful history means they aren’t budging.  Plus, Russia wouldn’t let them go anywhere, anyways.  

No, it wouldn't. If Ukraine is in a position to roll down the peninsula they will.

Also the Tatars are not a Ukrainian ally, they're Ukrainian citizens in occupied territory. The fact that there are potential hostages hasn't discouraged Ukraine from recovering any of its other territory. 

> Which leaves regaining Crimea thru negotiations.  This requires a change of regime in Russia, or a situation that Russia is in such dire straights that it will willingly cede any claims to the territory—because it has said it will use nukes to defend it. 

Flawed assessment. Ukraine would obviously prefer a diplomatic solution; it's an admission of defeat by Russia. Ukraine will not hesitate to use force if required.

> And even of Russia agrees to cede control of Crimean territory, dismantle the bridge, remove the additional ports and bases—there’s still like 15 reasons it’s still a mess—there’s actual legitimate legal questions over the lease of that naval base.   

What are these reasons? Do you seriously think that Ukraine gives a shit about the Russian government's lease after defending against them in a war of aggression? 

> And I can’t imagine Ukraine sees the continuation of the lease—which was voided for nonpayment. Or voided bc hostile takeover. Or voided bc “treason” (least legally viable argument)—as possible going forward. 
 
Oh good, we agree that the lease is void and a non-issue.

> Which means Russia would have to give up Crimea, and a major port they’ve had for 100 years, and all this is enforced without Ukraine having a navy—Ukraine could not have enough carrot or stick to get Russia to do this. 
 
Sounds like Russia's problem. Ukraine absolutely has the will and the ability to defeat the Russians if Western support continues. 

> It would require a third party to be party—like US or UK or EU—and has to be things so great that Russia is salivating puddles to get—like immediate retraction of all sanctions—but Russia isn’t there yet.  They’re not in a painful enough spot.  China needs to cut them off.

Sanctions are having quite the effect, it's still going to take more time for that to become critical.

This leads to voter apathy which makes conservatives stronger.

Biden is handling China and Russia perfectly.

However, I think some real tech resulted from SDI (see Project Marauder) among others.

Part of the impetus behind Reagan's SDI in the 80s was to defend the US from a Soviet ICBM attack launched by rogue Soviet actors (since USSR was in decline and had many, many nukes spread across the SSRs).

For now, US mainly has GBI (ground based interceptor) missiles as anti-ICBM defense but it's mostly for North Korea / Iran as there aren't enough interceptors for a county like Russia. Aegis ABM could help as well but again, not enough coverage / missiles against Russian nuke arsenal. Both have been in development since the 80s. No telling what's been developed in the time since.

They push exactly the narrative you’re putting forward to try to brand themselves as a counterbalance to leftism so that people believe that their narrative is equally valid as other mainstream media. I’m on the fence about whether you’re speaking from the perspective of someone who just leans towards contrarianism, or if you’re an operative in here purposely trying to amplify right wing extremists. 

MSNBC is appealing to older center left people. It’s not purporting to be neutral and it has a slant which they’re transparent about, but not one that is representative of progressives or the so-called “far left.” They’ve backed centrist Democrats and intentionally shut out or ignored politicians who are controversially left. They steer clear of positions on the left that are going to be controversial, like trans rights or BDS. Fox has increasingly normalized extremist politicians who advocate for fascism (I mean that in a very literal way). They’ve also been supportive of Putin and their most popular pundits are quite literally Russian operatives who have taken funds directly from the Kremlin with the purpose of destabilizing our democracy and pushing us towards a coup by validating conspiracy theories and weakening trust in the system.

It is *not the same* and pushing the narrative that it is is actively harmful. Fox doesn’t need people to believe that they’re representing an unbiased centrist perspective, and nobody thinks that they are. They just need people to believe that they’re reporting news that deviates from the center only as much as MSNBC does—exactly what you’re arguing. If they’re only a little bit to the right, then they’re not reporting lies, only a different perspective on the truth, and that belief is what allows people take Fox at face value.

You can see this in polling in Ukraine and in Crimea leasing up to the annexation. Recall in February 2014 they ousted the Russian sycophant Viktor Yanukovych, right before the annexation occurred.

According to [this](https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng&cat=reports&id=236&page=1) poll by the KYIV INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE of SOCIOLOGY, which is a relatively credible Ukrainian (and specifically not Russian) pollster. The Percentage of those, who wants Ukraine to join Russia, table shows 35.9% before and 41.0% after the ouster. Which many conservatives and Russian sympathetic Ukrainians saw as negative. And most likely resulted in numbers moving more towards Russian annexation.

I think there was a possibility enough support existed for doing it legitimately, Russia obviously didn't let that occur.

But the sham referendum definitely doesn't indicate there wasn't significant support for Russia.

Your other point, I'm honestly not sure how that's impacted Crimea. It may be fair enough, but I definitely think Ukraine isn't going to be walking into a primarily supportive population.

With the removal of the Russian port and presence I think they could easily convert the population (and displace those that don't want to be Ukrainian) enough to make it tenable.

But check this out…



https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area



Africa recently created the biggest and most comprehensive free-trade zone in the world. If you look at that map you’ll notice that it’s the countries that Russia is meddling in that haven’t signed up yet. Not a coincidence.




There has even been movement recently on the idea of combining several East African nations in to one!

It’s actually playing in to Africas advantage that none of their borders make any sense.
