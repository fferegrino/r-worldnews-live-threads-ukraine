Shell to stop purchases of Russian crude oil
Shell

Oil giant Shell says it is sorry for buying a shipment of Russian oil last week at knock-down prices.

""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel - despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking - was not the right one and we are sorry,"" chief executive Ben van Beurden says.

The business says it will immediately stop all spot purchases of Russian crude oil and will shut its service stations, aviation fuel and lubricants operations in Russia.

It says its withdrawal from other associations with Russia will be done ""in a phased manner, aligned with new government guidance"".

Several major international companies have pulled out of Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

Fuel prices have shot up since the attack, with the average price for a litre of petrol at UK pumps hitting a record high of £1.56.

* Currently Europe imports 1768 Terrawatt hours of natural gas from Russia a year: Germany accounts for 450 of this.

* The first step would be for Germany to fill up its reserves using *liquid gas* from other countries, which would equate to 275 Terrawatt hours. **Germany needs to build terminals for this type of gas.**

* The next step would be for the German government (or EU) to step in and control where gas is bought from instead of private companies.

* In the short term, coal will have to be used for factories as the current supply of natural gas will need to be restricted. They accept the environmental impacts but point to the fact it is an immediate solution and requires no changing of infrastructure.

* An optimistic scenario requires the coming winter to *not* be colder than average.

* There will need to be government intervention to limit the impact of rising energy prices.

If possible to do, it would cut off c. 1/4 of Russia's gas exports to Europe and makes Putin's threats null and void.",1646745842.0,1646745025.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

(11:37) 

Russian forces are preparing to attack Kyiv in the coming days, according to this eye-catching analysis from the Institute for the Study of War.

The closely-followed US military think tank believes that “Russian forces are concentrating in the eastern, northwestern, and western outskirts of Kyiv for an assault on the capital in the coming 24-96 hours.” Russian forces, plagued by logistics problems, have hardly advanced recently, but the ISW said they were “bringing up supplies and reinforcements as well as conducting artillery, air, and missile attacks to weaken defences and intimidate defenders in advance of such an assault”.

This could herald the start of a critical moment in the war, the analysts write in their latest daily overview.

It is too soon to gauge the likely effectiveness of any Russian attempt to complete the encirclement of Kyiv or to seize the city at this time. If Russian troops have been able to resupply, reorganise, and plan deliberate and coordinated simultaneous operations along the several axes of advance around and into the capital, they may be more successful in this operation than they have in previous undertakings.",False,1646739711.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Before Russia invaded Ukraine, U.S. officials warned China would seek insights for a potential attack on Taiwan. Nearly two weeks in, Vladimir Putin’s war looks more like a deterrent to Xi Jinping than a road map.


Russia’s experience in Ukraine so far suggests that superior firepower alone wouldn’t be enough to guarantee a swift victory with minimal casualties. In Taiwan, where warnings of a Chinese invasion are constant, residents were encouraged by Russia’s early struggles. 


Russia’s struggle to quickly subdue Ukraine despite its superior military is the biggest red flag for China. Hu Xijin, formerly the editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed Global Times, wrote in December that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be over in “a matter of hours” due to a lack of resistance by Taiwan.


Yet events in Ukraine suggest those assumptions may be optimistic. The U.S. tracked Putin’s military buildup for months, and Russia’s army has had difficulty maintaining supply lines despite sharing land borders over a vast area. Moreover, Russia still hasn’t achieved air superiority even though the U.S. and its allies explicitly rejected calls to send troops or enforce a no-fly zone. Of course, Russia has yet to deploy much of its air power. 


“The Ukraine crisis will make Beijing think twice about military adventurism,” said Wen-Ti Sung, a lecturer at the Australian National University’s Taiwan studies program. “It just further raised the threshold of local military superiority that Beijing must enjoy before it can feel confident it’ll win in a cross-strait conflict.”",1646745516.0,1646745073.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Here's an interview Zelenskyy gave. I find his comments about NATO and his willingness to compromise on the issues of Crimea /Donesk/Luhansk interesting. 

There appears to be room for negotiating developing.


___________



Zelensky in an interview with ABC:

We are the people who elected me - not ready for capitulation and ultimatums.

As for Ukraine's accession to NATO, I lost interest in this issue after we realized that NATO is afraid of a confrontation with Russia and is not ready to accept Ukraine. We will not be a country that begs for something on its knees.

As for the ""pseudo-republics"", we are ready to discuss this and look for a compromise on how these territories will exist. What is important for me is how people who want to be part of Ukraine will live there. This issue is much more complicated than just the recognition of these territories.

Putin needs to start a dialogue and stop being in his information bubble, we do not know how realistic the information he receives in this bubble is.

Push the old folks out, Germans move in or move back to places they had been forced out of after WWI. Makes for an easy way to hold newly acquired countries.

Of course Russia can't do this.  Putin is in the opposite situation. Their population is aging and declining and not resettling in Ukraine. There are millions of ethnic Russians in Ukraine and Putin probably thought they would become the overlords of a new subjugated Ukraine.

Here's my opinion to ""Why did Putin do this now?""

This has been brewing for years, since 2014 when Ukraine tried to get into the EU. When that failed and Putin's puppet got overthrown, he had to act. He put ukraines border in a conflict zone so they couldn't get into EU or NATO. He bided his time to take over all of Ukraine. 

Here comes Trump. Putin played trump like a god damn fiddle and convinced him he should pull out of NATO. Trump's national security advisor confirms Trump was going to pull out of NATO in his second term.

That gives Putin the greenlight to not only take Ukraine, but the Baltic states as well (which some are in NATO, but Putin was under the assumption his military could take on the whole EU, just not the USA.)

Trump did his thing, got kicked to the curb. Putin decides.. well, Russia isn't getting stronger, our population is declining, I'm getting old and don't know how much time I have. I need to secure Russia's border and I want my legacy to be reuniting Russia as I see it.

[Original post (in Russian)](https://i.imgur.com/NJ7x3SQ.png)

>I spoke to a guy that I know from the store, and he really opened my eyes. **Damnit, now I know why such a large number of people are genuinely happy about the increasing pressure being put on our country.** I was surprised by the simplicity of this guy's answer. 

>Our people have lived in poverty for a long time, to put it mildly. For example, most of our fellow citizens don't even dream about ever owning a luxurious car. It's hard enough to buy a used one with a loan. And so what does this kind of person see right now? Now NOBODY can afford a car. Any car.

>IKEA is gone? So be it. That means now nobody can buy furniture from there. Adidas and Nike — this clothing is for rich folks, so who needs it? We clothed ourselves somehow before, and we're not going to have problems with it now. Now all things have been MADE EQUAL, and that was the secret desire of so many people.

>Planes? I never flew and wasn't even able to get a passport, so does that make others better than me? NOBODY will fly now. Our manufacturing will grow! Oligarchs are getting their yachts and mansions taken away from them all over the world. It's some kind of holiday!

>**In short, it's amazing, but our foreign comrades messed up and by accident guessed the dreams of so many Russians. They equalized everyone and punished the wealthy. Do you understand? For that reason nobody's upset, but in fact happy.**

It looks like the comment has been removed or deleted by the poster (so I can't see the entirety of it), however the gist was about Zelenskyy's attitude and the talk of replacement government means he's not going to leave- which yes, now he's not- but I don't know if the rest of the comment was intended to say he intends to end up dead if it comes to that.

I obviously don't know what his ultimate plan is but I think it's just common sense to have a continuity plan in a situation like this and the US had to press the issue because he refused to evacuate *now.* That said, I don't think it's an indication that he intends to leave in a body bag. I think a lot of what he's saying is to boost morale and make it clear he's not going to bail on his people when the going gets tough and things could absolutely change- I think if Kyiv falls he'd could absolutely still try to help Ukraine from Lviv or even Poland or somewhere if it came to that.

Ultimately though even if it sucks it's his choice on what he thinks is best for himself, his safety, his family, and his people. I think it's just very tough to watch- in general- but also because it's so common for the leader to jump ship (I'm refraining from any judgement given that I have never personally experienced anything like this).",False,1646716691.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

This appears to be a quality paper examining Russia's reliance on China to protect their industries from supply chain issues and exposure to being cut off from (Crimean-level) sanctions. It seems to have been commissioned or inspired by the pandemic—so it was published around this time last year. I can parse come of it but I don't have the statistical and financial acumen to get a lot out of it other than their tech sector having the most risk of collapse. A lot of specificity here, but I hope someone out there might find it useful:

> The first group is critically import-dependent industries, for which the loss of imports will lead to a drop in output by more than 40% or to a “stop” of the industry: light industry, automotive, mechanical engineering, and the chemical industry.

> The second group is import-dependent industries, for which import restrictions may be significant. At least one of the models showed a drop in their production by more than 15%. These are metallurgy, production of rubber and plastic products, woodworking, furniture and other goods.

> The third group is industries for which the effect of restrictions is insignificant. These are the food industry, production of alcohol and tobacco, the pulp and paper industry, production of coke and petroleum products, production of nonmetallic mineral products, production of computers, electronic and optical products.

> Finally, the fourth group is the industries for which the WIOD models do not contain the necessary data: printed products, pharmaceuticals, metal products, electrical equipment, and transport engineering.

> **Conclusions and their use in public policy**. The modern economy, including the Russian economy, even with significant integration into world production chains, remains sufficiently resistant to local supply shocks, which may be due to the quantitatively small role of imported intermediate consumption in general and the possibilities of using alternative supply options. Without denying the existence of “weak links,” especially in the field of high-tech imported products, we note that the industry as a whole (with the exception of a fairly narrow set of industries and segments) is quite capable of adapting to changes in the world market. Global shocks, however, due to the impossibility of using alternatives, cause an inevitable negative reaction of domestic production.",False,1646726822.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

>ADDRESS TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION FROM THE STAFF OF ST. PETERSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY

>Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!

>At this difficult time you and our country, we are writing to you, a graduate of our University, with words of sincere support. We understand what a difficult and momentous decision you have had to make, and we wholeheartedly approve of it, realizing that you had no other choice.

>The voices of “pacifists”, who for many years ignored the ongoing war, the voices “for peace” and against the government, are ringing out loudly in our society. Unfortunately, this has happened more than once in our history. All the wars that Russia lost, Russia to itself because of internal disorder. In 1854, when the European coalition surrounded the empire from all around, at that time the Russian educated audience toasted champagne to our defeat. And so it was in 1905, when many opposition figures wished Russia to be defeated in the war with Japan because victory would have strengthened the Nicholas regime, which they hated. Will we really make the same mistake again?

>At historical moments of crisis, society must unite. It is unacceptable to take actions that lead to division. Unity should not be reflected in sympathy for extremes, which we see in a rapidly polarizing society, but in an understanding of national interests, in unwavering adherence to them. Calmness and a balanced and rational assessment of the situation must now become the basis of all our actions.

>A realistic view of the current situation in world politics makes us certain that the Russian government and army are not marching against the brotherly Ukrainian people but are defending not only the national security of Russia, but also the security of the entire world.

>We deeply mourn all victims of the conflict that has been going on in Ukraine for 8 years now and hope for a speedy end to it. We express our support to your policy aimed at demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, establishment of peace and restoration of friendly relations between the brotherly peoples of Ukraine and Russia!

An elderly couple just torn apart by a Russian war machine...no no no no... this is just devastating.  

This has gone too far,  NATO needs to intervene.  

So Russia is killing evacuees during a cease fire, mining the evacuation routes, and potentially allowing a nuclear disaster to happen... 

They're shelling residential areas that are miles from the front, indiscriminately bombing civilians in the cities, and now not only sending their fascist Wagner mercenaries but now paying Syrian war criminals to go cause more damage to Ukraine? 

This has gotten way out of hand and it is time for Europe,  NATO, and our global allies to put a stop to this.  

They deserve a NATO no fly zone or more. This propaganda that it will somehow start WWIII is maddening... Russia is barely a regional power, and no other country is going to go to war to stop NATO from defending Ukraine. 

Russia has zero pragmatic reason to use nukes, he simply won't do it unless NATO enters Russian territory,  possibly Crimea. Don't let Putin's madman strategy turn this into another Chamberlain fiasco or allied lack of urgency around the holocaust.

///

BEIJING, March 8. /TASS/. The Chinese government calls on the United States to immediately disclose information about the military biological laboratories located in Ukraine and the viruses that were investigated there. This was announced on Tuesday at a regular briefing by the official representative of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian.

As he noted, 26 American laboratories and other such facilities operated on the territory of Ukraine. ""The United States, as the party that has the greatest amount of information about laboratories, should disclose relevant data as soon as possible, including on the viruses found there and the essence of research on them,"" he said.

""In the name of the health of the residents of Ukraine, neighboring regions and beyond, we call on the relevant parties to ensure the safety of these laboratories,"" Zhao Lijian stressed. ""The United States, as the party that has the greatest amount of information about laboratories, should disclose relevant data as soon as possible, including on the viruses found there and the essence of research on them,"" he said.

U.S. military biological programs in Ukraine may be just the tip of the iceberg. Under the pretext of cooperation to reduce biological risks in the field of safety and protection of world health, the United States controls 336 laboratories in 30 countries. The American side also carried out many military biological studies in the Fort Detrick laboratory. What are the true intentions of the United States? What exactly were they doing?"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

""We call on the United States to provide comprehensive information about its military biological programs both on American territory and abroad, as well as to accept international verification,"" the diplomat concluded.",1646731800.0,1646730730.0,t3_t98pp8,t3_t98pp8,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

So now you're spending is at 100% but your cash on hand is reduced. Your currency crashes so buying external things is twice as expensive. And inflation is so high that internal costs increase too. Essentially your spending is still at 100% but your earnings is at 50% and you can't take out a loan to cover the difference.

So now you need to severely cut services and you're incapable of doing new things because they cost money.

\- Shitty credit: So the worst part in the long run is this tanks the debtors credit and reputation. It will be significantly harder to even get more loans, and the terms of these loans is affected immensely, so your country won't get a good deal for a long time to come. And countries need credit in order to fund their growth.

\- Interest rates: Then you got other shit like higher internal interest rates.

\- Bank runs: Mass withdrawals among the people because they will be afraid the government is gonna seize their assets to cover the loans.

\- Higher exchange rates: Holders will switch to a more stable currency which tanks your own currency value.

\- Trade embargos: Other countries may impose trade embargo, which means they got your economy by the balls. This may be counter-intuitive though since you also cripple their ability to generate income, but then again if you suspect they have the money already it could work.

Day three: Chechens! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces. 

Tomorrow: Street Sharks!

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

It's clear that she has a Pro-Russian view (seeing a couple social media posts she made), but I also know that she has doubts, eg. in regards to Putin and his intentions.

Just two days ago she sent me a link with an interview of that ""Scott Ritter"" guy, former US weapons inspector, and actually now writing for RT and thus quite literally paid by the Russian government.

Interview had ABSURD statements, for example Scott Ritter was up until 2 weeks ago denying that Russia will invade Ukraine, and even cynically put Russian ""military buildup"" in quotes and outright denying it, while Russia in front of the entire world was building up their military on the borders.

I didn't let her know about me VERY pacifist/pro-Western view since I don't think it will be constructive. (We love each other, and she is already getting criticized by many others of her friends who are trying to convince her that she is wrong, and she is getting frustrated about it).

The thing is: My GF is HYPER INTELLIGENT.

I am relying on that in time she can look at all information that is available, and come to her own conclusion what the truth is. She certainly is smart enough to be able to do that.

When it can no longer do this, the economy will be in 'freefall', and eventually lead to [sovereign default](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_default).  This means the currency devalues until the government reaches a point where they can no longer make payments on debt owed either to other states or to internal parties.  While nobody can force Russia to pay debts it owes, including its own citizens, there are consequences.  It receives a D or lower credit rating and will not see foreign investment.  Citizens will not buy bonds.  State banks cannot issue loans.  Printing more money becomes meaningless.  It's an economic black hole.  

There's no easy way of overcoming sovereign default without the assistance of other countries that are trading partners, an assistance assured only when *their* economies stand to take a loss from missing out your business.  Greece, for example, was assisted by other European nations to 'control' its default in a way in which there was a path back.  

Russia has no path back from that scenario except through the 7-8 creditor nations still trading with it, and there will be significant pressure on those nations not to do so (and of course any such aid would mean restructuring their own economies, which they may not want or be able to do).

They have done irreversible damage to the country's economic prospects, infrastructure, research and technology as well as debasing many parliamentary prìnciples on which our constitution is based.

 Liz Truss obviously did not encourage the heightening of nuclear alert levels, however she is a lightweight who makes naive, propaganda fuelling statements and has repeatedly demonstrated that she does not have a grip on her remit. She is only there because Dominic Raab needed to use up his air miles. 

Priti Patel is repeatedly off the mark, pouring fuel on the flames of xenophobia for easy political points with a voter base that is disconnected with the reality of the world and at times outright callous. The situation she finds herself in (visa pressure) however, is a mixture of systemic cuts, incompetence as well as a lack of humanity. 

Boris Johnson is completely unsuitable for office, no need to clarify that particularly but his constant overtures of how much value the assets the UK has sanctioned vs the US or the EU must be recognised for what it is; a measure of the amount of Russian money in the UK (not as they will try to spin, our world leading sanctions), particularly to laundromat that is the city of London. 

Though it could be straight incompetence leading to the slow movement with regard to individual assets (despite all sides of the house willing to back almost any proposals to speed the process up) the likelihood is that they are deliberately acting in the interests of business associates (I am somewhat sceptical that Boris Johnson's 'Not all Russians are bad', whilst a reasonable statement by itself is possibly laying the groundwork for a defence of his own connections). 

The Russia report is depressing reading and it's findings were blocked for a long time. It implicates members of this government and should be followed up.

DPR head Alexander Zakharchenko claimed in August 2014 that there were around 3,000 to 4,000 Russian volunteers fighting for his militia, which included serving and retired Russian Army servicemen.[20] It is alleged that since September 2015, the separatist units, at the battalion level and up, are acting under direct command of Russian Army officers, with former local commanders sometimes serving as their deputies.",False,1646716983.0,t3_t98pp8,t1_hzswndf,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

After putting up a hell of a fight, Ukraine finally accepts a full end to the conflict on the condition that they cede land from roughly Kherson to Luhansk. Russia is willing to do this because it gives them full control and easy access to the energy-rich Crimea and Donetsk regions, plus better positioning in the Black Sea. 

Ukraine gets to stop fighting and starts the rebuilding process, but since they are now practically land-locked (especially in winter) and they ceded the those resource-rich areas, their progress in rebuilding their infrastructure, defenses, and economy is slow. Eventually the Ukranian people get frustrated with the slow rebuild and poorer living conditions than they had prior to the invasion. Russia takes this opportunity to influence their elections and prop up a Putin puppet (though not an obvious one). Russia succeeds because tampering with elections is apparently the only thing Russians are good at. From there on out, they basically treat Ukraine like Belarus and starts to invade Moldova.

By Thomas Gibbons-Neff
May 24, 2018
WASHINGTON — The artillery barrage was so intense that the American commandos dived into foxholes for protection, emerging covered in flying dirt and debris to fire back at a column of tanks advancing under the heavy shelling. It was the opening salvo in a nearly four-hour assault in February by around 500 pro-Syrian government forces — including Russian mercenaries — that threatened to inflame already-simmering tensions between Washington and Moscow.

In the end, 200 to 300 of the attacking fighters were killed. The others retreated under merciless airstrikes from the United States, returning later to retrieve their battlefield dead. None of the Americans at the small outpost in eastern Syria — about 40 by the end of the firefight — were harmed.

The details of the Feb. 7 firefight were gleaned from interviews and documents newly obtained by The New York Times. They provide the Pentagon’s first public on-the-ground accounting of one of the single bloodiest battles the American military has faced in Syria since deploying to fight the Islamic State.

The firefight was described by the Pentagon as an act of self-defense against a unit of pro-Syrian government forces. In interviews, United States military officials said they had watched — with dread — hundreds of approaching rival troops, vehicles and artillery pieces in the week leading up to the attack.

The prospect of Russian military forces and American troops colliding has long been feared as the Cold War adversaries take opposing sides in Syria’s seven-year civil war.

At worst, officials and experts have said, it could plunge both countries into bloody conflict. And at a minimum, squaring off in crowded battlefields has added to heightened tensions between Russia and the United States as they each seek to exert influence in the Middle East.

Commanders of the rival militaries had long steered clear of the other by speaking through often-used deconfliction telephone lines. In the days leading up to the attack, and on opposite sides of the Euphrates River, Russia and the United States were backing separate offensives against the Islamic State in Syria’s oil-rich Deir al-Zour Province, which borders Iraq.

American military officials repeatedly warned about the growing mass of troops. But Russian military officials said they had no control over the fighters assembling near the river — even though American surveillance equipment monitoring radio transmissions had revealed the ground force was speaking in Russian.

The documents described the fighters as a “pro-regime force,” loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. It included some Syrian government soldiers and militias, but American military and intelligence officials have said a majority were private Russian paramilitary mercenaries — and most likely a part of the Wagner Group, a company often used by the Kremlin to carry out objectives that officials do not want to be connected to the Russian government.

“The Russian high command in Syria assured us it was not their people,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told senators in testimony last month. He said he directed Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “for the force, then, to be annihilated.” “And it was.”

Amassing forces
The day began with little hint of the battle that was about to unfold.

A team of about 30 Delta Force soldiers and Rangers from the Joint Special Operations Command were working alongside Kurdish and Arab forces at a small dusty outpost next to a Conoco gas plant, near the city of Deir al-Zour.

Roughly 20 miles away, at a base known as a mission support site, a team of Green Berets and a platoon of infantry Marines stared at their computer screens, watching drone feeds and passing information to the Americans at the gas plant about the gathering fighters.

At 3 p.m. the Syrian force began edging toward the Conoco plant. By early evening, more than 500 troops and 27 vehicles — including tanks and armored personnel carriers — had amassed.

In the American air operations center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, and at the Pentagon, confounded military officers and intelligence analysts watched the scene unfold. Commanders briefed pilots and ground crews. Aircraft across the region were placed on alert, military officials said.

Back at the mission support site, the Green Berets and Marines were preparing a small reaction force — roughly 16 troops in four mine-resistant vehicles — in case they were needed at the Conoco plant. They inspected their weapons and ensured the trucks were loaded with anti-tank missiles, thermal optics and food and water.


At 8:30 p.m., three Russian-made T-72 tanks — vehicles weighing nearly 50 tons and armed with 125-millimeter guns — moved within a mile of the Conoco plant. Bracing for an attack, the Green Berets prepared to launch the reaction force.

At the outpost, American soldiers watched a column of tanks and other armored vehicles turn and drive toward them around 10 p.m., emerging from a neighborhood of houses where they had tried to gather undetected.

A half-hour later, the Russian mercenaries and Syrian forces struck.

The Conoco outpost was hit with a mixture of tank fire, large artillery and mortar rounds, the documents show. The air was filled with dust and shrapnel. The American commandos took cover, then ran behind dirt berms to fire anti-tank missiles and machine guns at the advancing column of armored vehicles.

For the first 15 minutes, American military officials called their Russian counterparts and urged them to stop the attack. When that failed, American troops fired warning shots at a group of vehicles and a howitzer.

Basically nobody knows for sure at what point Russia would engage NATO (there’s a clearer sense of when the reverse happens but even that could change).

Also, them taking that major step towards nuclear war is one of the few things that could make their allies of China and India actually cut them off completely.

2. As far as I can tell, right now, NATO seems mostly willing to provide jets.  The problems seem two-fold.  First, they probably don't want Russian radar to see military jets crossing the NATO boarders into the Ukrainian combat zone as this would, understandably, look indistinguishable from actual direct NATO involvement in the war.  Second, the Polish, on deeper reflection, probably want to make sure that they have something to replace those MIGs with, for their own defense, before they give them away.  I believe that's why the discussion has turned towards the US giving Poland F-16's to back-fill their defense needs.

Zelenskyy's life a month ago was being the president of a beautiful, thriving nation about to enter into its farming season. Now, he's watching his people being shelled and bombed, and Europe is *watching*. Let's be honest. Even if we ARE helping. We are also straight up doomscrolling for more news online. Our leaders aren't doing anything to stop the death of Ukrainian civilians and push back the Russians. 

Now, yes, Zelenskyy likely *knows* that, rationally, they can't intervene because Russia is threatening WWIII and that would kill everyone on the planet. But no matter what, that's going to hurt, and you're going to be mad about it. It's like your neighbour broke down your door with an assault rifle, thrashed up your home, killed your beloved pet, and you're BEGGING the police to stop the guy, but the criminal threatens to set every house in the neighbourhood on fire if they dare to stop them - so the police give YOU all the weapons and guns you'll need to stop them, but god fucking damit, you need NUMBERS to overwhelm the guy, not just grenades and guns. But you also know the guy can and will set every house in the neighbourhood on fire. 

Zelenskyy has nothing to lose by making outrageous demands. Ukraine is his home. He's making demands he knows won't be granted because he NEEDS that help and knows it's the only way to GUARANTEE victory and to stop the genocide of his people. He also knows that logistically, they can't do anything more than what they're doing. 

At this point, it's likely this war ends in a stand-off where there's no real victory on either side. Zelenskyy wants leverage against Russia to discourage them from pulling this stunt again - but at this point, negotiating Crimea as Russian territory and Donetsk as sovereign is something he might genuinely have to consider sacrificing to end this war, and he straight up doesn't want that. That's like allowing said house-breaker permanent access to your garage, and he wants to think that the police will do something to prevent that - but instead they're trying to tell you there's nothing they can do and he might have to accept that in order to get rid of the guy. And that's bullshit.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Seems like a transparent attempt at demoralizing. It is impossible to know precisely how well or unwell the Ukrainians are doing - but all outside reports apart from the propaganda on the Russian side hints at them holding up very well, even winning on a number of fronts. A number of military analysts have even shifted their predictions to account for this, and in all cases it seems clear Russia is absolutely not ""winning"" this war, even if Ukraine is also not winning.

- A long war is disastrous on the economy in general, plus with the sanctions in this case some experts say that Russia will be bankrupt by mid Spring
- Letting untrained or greener troops invade first  gives such an advantage to the Ukrainians that it will allow them to actually train civilians in their home turf with terrain advantage (in relative safety that is) which will allow them to be better defenders as the war goes on. 
- With all these Russian High Officers now KIA I don’t think they would be sending officers with untrained troops that have no experience in the first place.

 >The Battle of the Bulge, also known as the Ardennes Offensive, was a major German offensive campaign on the Western Front during World War II which took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945. It was launched through the densely forested Ardennes region between Belgium and Luxembourg towards the end of the war in Europe. The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and to split the Allied lines, allowing the Germans to encircle and destroy the four Allied forces and cause the Allies to negotiate a peace treaty in the Axis powers' favor.

Overconfidence in their planning - it becomes clear that main goal of their invasion was in the southern part of Ukraine to establish a land connection between Crimea and rest of Russia and that front sees most of progress.

 >A sovereign default is the failure or refusal of the  government of a sovereign state to pay back its debt in full when due. Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by that government's formal declaration that it will not pay (or only partially pay) its debts (repudiation), or it may be unannounced. A credit rating agency will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural defaults, and failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments. Countries have at times escaped some of the real burden of their debt through inflation.

The idea was initially to build more nukes (and other tools of war) than Russia in a race that would certainly bankrupt them. Eventually the economics caught up and we slowly agreed to reduce nukes on both sides as tensions cooled. However the number was never zero and M.A.D. was, and still is, looming over the world  And pretty much we have been able to avoid the apocalypse because of it ever since.

Or if you believe conspiracy theories.... The mid-earthians, aka lizard-people, secretly approached the global leaders after too many nukes were tested in a short time span and threatened the world.

Yes Ukraine has done an amazing job of repelling a heavily disorganized Russia but the stages troops were still like 15% of their total military and 80%+ of the staged army is still operational in some capacity. Supply lines in the well held areas will be reinforced and they will chip away at taking land from the South + East, forcing Ukraine troops in the middle to move West in order to not be cut off from their own supply lines, effectively giving them control of the entire eastern side of the country. 

This war is going to go on for awhile and every time Ukraine losses a jet, AA position or piece of equipment it ends up being more costly to them then the Russian losses are to Russia simply because of man power alone. In all likelihood, Russia will take control of the larger cities up to Kyiv, but it's going to be a gut wrenching war for the world to witness as these cities get utterly destroyed.

Where they can't actually win is likely in long term occupation or governance. They would need to have Russian troops locking down cities for the next decade while simultaneously fighting insurgency, and we all know how the Russian financial situation looks.

It still sounds insane but the best way out of this for literally all parties is still diplomatically.

It's actually insane how badly Putin has misjudged this situation, and to think, if he had just come to the big boy table to play with the other developed nations 10+ years ago he would have vastly improved Russia's economic standing in almost every way imaginable as well as deteriorated the need for Nato in the first place.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Not really.

The destructive potential of a nuclear weapon can only be realised due to a particular series of events inside the physics package.

If you can destroy the missile before it reaches its detonation point, and can cause sufficient damage to the warhead itself that the detonation sequence either can't properly complete or can't even start, then all you've got is a bunch of fissile material plummeting towards the ground.

39ecafbf85a9714799dc3aaf30bebbd0,t98pp8,hzt4v9k,"From the horizon, a barrage of artillery
American warplanes arrived in waves, including Reaper drones, F-22 stealth fighter jets, F-15E Strike Fighters, B-52 bombers, AC-130 gunships and AH-64 Apache helicopters. For the next three hours, American officials said, scores of strikes pummeled enemy troops, tanks and other vehicles. Marine rocket artillery was fired from the ground.

The reaction team sped toward the fight. It was dark, according to the documents, and the roads were littered with felled power lines and shell craters. The 20-mile drive was made all the more difficult since the trucks did not turn on their headlights, relying solely on thermal-imaging cameras to navigate.

As the Green Berets and Marines neared the Conoco plant around 11:30 p.m., they were forced to stop. The barrage of artillery was too dangerous to drive through until airstrikes silenced the enemy’s howitzers and tanks.

At the plant, the commandos were pinned down by enemy artillery and burning through ammunition. Flashes from tank muzzles, antiaircraft weapons and machine guns lit up the air.

At 1 a.m., with the artillery fire dwindling, the team of Marines and Green Berets pulled up to the Conoco outpost and began firing. By then, some of the American warplanes had returned to base, low on either fuel or ammunition.


The United States troops on the ground, now roughly 40 in all, braced their defenses as the mercenaries left their vehicles and headed toward the outpost on foot.

A handful of Marines ran ammunition to machine guns and Javelin missile launchers scattered along the berms and wedged among the trucks. Some of the Green Berets and Marines took aim from exposed hatches. Others remained in their trucks, using a combination of thermal screens and joysticks to control and fire the heavy machine guns affixed on their roofs.

A few of the commandos, including Air Force combat controllers, worked the radios to direct the next fleet of bombers flying toward the battlefield. At least one Marine exposed himself to incoming fire as he used a missile guidance computer to find targets’ locations and pass them on to the commandos calling in the airstrikes.

An hour later, the enemy fighters had started to retreat and the American troops stopped firing. From their outpost, the commandos watched the mercenaries and Syrian fighters return to collect their dead. The small team of American troops was not harmed. One allied Syrian fighter was wounded.

Who led the ill-fated attack?
The number of casualties from the Feb. 7 fight is in dispute.

Initially, Russian officials said only four Russian citizens — but perhaps dozens more — were killed; a Syrian officer said around 100 Syrian soldiers had died. The documents obtained by The Times estimated 200 to 300 of the “pro-regime force” were killed.

The outcome of the battle, and much of its mechanics, suggest that the Russian mercenaries and their Syrian allies were in the wrong part of the world to try a simple, massed assault on an American military position. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the United States Central Command has refined the amount of equipment, logistics, coordination and tactics required to mix weapons fired from both the air and ground.

Questions remain about exactly who the Russian mercenaries were, and why they attacked.

American intelligence officials say that the Wagner Group, known by the nickname of the retired Russian officer who leads it, is in Syria to seize oil and gas fields and protect them on behalf of the Assad government. The mercenaries earn of a share of the production proceeds from the oil fields they reclaim, officials said.

The mercenaries loosely coordinate with the Russian military in Syria, although Wagner’s leaders have reportedly received awards in the Kremlin, and its mercenaries are trained at the Russian Defense Ministry’s bases.

Russian government forces in Syria maintain they were not involved in the battle. But in recent weeks, according to United States military officials, they have jammed the communications of smaller American drones and gunships such as the type used in the attack.

“Right now in Syria, we’re in the most aggressive E.W. environment on the planet from our adversaries,” Gen. Tony Thomas, the head of United States Special Operations Command, said recently, referring to electronic warfare. “They’re testing us every day.”

 >The Central African Republic Civil War is an ongoing civil war in the Central African Republic (CAR) involving the government, rebels from the Séléka coalition, and anti-balaka militias. In the preceding Central African Republic Bush War (2004–2007), the government of President François Bozizé fought with rebels until a peace agreement in 2007. The current conflict arose when a new coalition of varied rebel groups, known as Séléka, accused the government of failing to abide by the peace agreements, captured many towns in 2012 and seized the capital in 2013. Bozizé fled the country, and the rebel leader Michel Djotodia declared himself president.
 
**[Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_civil_war)** 
 
 >The Russian military intervention in the Syrian civil war began in September 2015, after an official request by the Syrian government for military aid against rebel groups. The intervention initially involved air strikes by Russian aircraft deployed to the Khmeimim base against targets primarily in north-western Syria, and against Syrian opposition militant groups opposed to the Syrian government, including the Syrian National Coalition, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in Syria) and the Army of Conquest. In addition, Russian special operations forces and military advisors are deployed to Syria.

 >The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances comprises three identical political agreements signed at the OSCE conference in Budapest, Hungary on 5 December 1994 to provide security assurances by its signatories relating to the accession of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The memorandum was originally signed by three nuclear powers: the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual assurances in separate documents.

Edit: not sure why Im downvoted. Its true, feel free to look it up. The individual SSRs didnt have firing control over the weapons stationed on their land. Just like Montana doesnt have the ability to launch ICBMs whenever they want. After the collapse, gorbachev gave the Nuclear launch codes to Yeltsin.

Kanye West's campaign was run by GOP operatives in 2020 as an attempt to do the same thing Jill Stein did.

Ukraine has overthrown it's elected leaders twice in the last 20 years, and of course, there's been grumblings about whether it's elections have been fair. It's got an ugly political-ethnic divide, with the eastern half of the country, especially the areas Russia took over, being full of ethnic Russians who consider themselves essentially disenfranchised by their political candidates not being allowed to win. That's hardly a 'healthy democracy'. Even that hotbed of Western Capitalist thought, the Economist Intelligence Unit, can't bring itself to class Ukraine using the term 'democracy', placing it as a 'hybrid regime' next to the likes of corrupt, cartel-infested Mexico, serial coup-magnet Fiji and civil-war prone Liberia.

Not to mention the stimulus that Euromaidan gave Ukrainian fascists and ultranationalists, who, while thankfully less prominent than they were 8 years ago, have formed paramilitary units that got absorbed into the state forces (even the Azov battalion's PR shills admit that 10-20% of it's soldiers are actual neo-Nazis; now extrapolate how many more are Nazi-adjacent fascists). This too, is a significant problem.

So for a futures contract of December 2026, two parties are agreeing to exchange USD for Russian rubles at the agreed upon price (in this case, Dec 2026 is 0.002135) vs today's price of 0.0078. That is a decrease of 0.005665 between now and December 2026. Or simply put, a 73% decrease. Although the ruble will decrease far more, and far faster at that.

Its a way to do price discovery of an asset in the future. Futures are great products to help reduce risk and smooth out economic and product uncertainty. Have you ever heard the term ""trade the weather""? You can literally trade the weather. Which sounds silly, but it is an important way for small towns to buy what essentially amounts to an insurance contract in case a huge blizzard hits and they need millions of dollars to pay for snow removal.

Another use for a futures contract would be an airline. If Jet Blue is worried about the price of gas in summer 2024, they can buy a futures contract now that locks in the price and amount and guarantees that they have fuel that will be delivered in the summer of 2024.

Nukes.

Im not sure if you noticed but half the reason ukraine is doing so well is because we sent a fuck tonne of modern weaponry that open their tanks like tin cans, are giving them up to date intelligence and advice, and have brought the russian economy and ability to continue the war to its knees.

Pretending the rest of the world has done nothing purely because they dont want to start a world war and get billions killed in the guaranteed nuclear exchange that would happen is kind of insulting. Spitting in the face of the people helping and supplying you is not a smart tactic.

You will of course find online trolls posing or attempting to pose as them, long an issue on reddit, as these are used for the right-wing's both-sides-isms.

Russian trolls for example, before they began to recently disperse, were littering the r / worldnews posts with all sorts of nonsense, including the really obvious trying to pretend left-wing pro-Russians were a thing in the US, which again is both-sides-ism bullshit.

 >Encirclement is a military term for the situation when a force or target is isolated and surrounded by enemy forces. The situation is highly dangerous for the encircled force. At the strategic level, it cannot receive supplies or reinforcements, and on the tactical level, the units in the force can be subject to an attack from several sides. Lastly, since the force cannot retreat, unless it is relieved or can break out, it must fight to the death or surrender.

If you're in Dallas, you're dead. 13 miles outside of Dallas, your skin begins to burn, you go blind from the flash, and the shockwave will either kill or severely damage all internal organs.

Fallout quickly spreads, falling both as radioactive rain and ash.

Local hospital networks are now overwhelmed and underequipped to handle the Fallout from a nuke.

 >Energy in the United States comes mostly from fossil fuels: in 2020, data showed that 35% of the nation's energy originates from petroleum, 10% from coal, and 34% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 9% and renewable energy supplied 12%, mainly from hydroelectric dams and biomass; however, this also includes other renewable sources like wind, geothermal, and solar. The United States was the second-largest energy consumer in 2010 after China. The country is ranked seventh in energy consumption per capita after Canada and several small nations.

I mean the problem is in ""unjust war"". War can't be justified. Period.

Then, Russians know that the war is on. Even in official media word ""war"" was unbanned several days ago. The problem is that the war is considered ""just war against evil nationalists occupying the Ukraine"". So it's not about being actually clueless, it's much more about justifying the war. Today official media told that Ukrainian nationalists shelled humanitarian help in Mariupol.

I think capitalism in practice is far from a perfect system but in theory it is basically the concept of ""free market"" and not simply an accumulation of money. The idea, as I understand it, is that anybody can choose to offer goods or services at whatever price they want. But the market will ultimately decide if that price is acceptable based on necessity as well as supply and demand. The competition between more entities in any one industry will lead to better prices for the market, which is why monopoly laws exist to prevent one entity being in control of the whole market in their respective sector. Ideally the system self regulates. However this is far from reality it seems thanks to your aforementioned corruption. And that corruption stems from greed and/or lust for power. Ultimately mans inability to treat fellow man according to a moral and ethical code is the root cause of conflict.

59b77cddb26a4fbcef8db8e394df4579,t98pp8,hztm7qw,"There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an Cessna 172, but we were some of the slowest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the 172. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Mundane, maybe. Even boring at times. But there was one day in our Cessna experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be some of the slowest guys out there, at least for a moment.

It occurred when my CFI and I were flying a training flight. We needed 40 hours in the plane to complete my training and attain PPL status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the 40 hour mark. We had made the turn back towards our home airport in a radius of a mile or two and the plane was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the left seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because I would soon be flying as a true pilot, but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Bumbling across the mountains 3,500 feet below us, I could only see the about 8 miles across the ground. I was, finally, after many humbling months of training and study, ahead of the plane.

I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for my CFI in the right seat. There he was, with nothing to do except watch me and monitor two different radios. This wasn't really good practice for him at all. He'd been doing it for years. It had been difficult for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my this part of my flying career, I could handle it on my own. But it was part of the division of duties on this flight and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. My CFI was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding awkward on the radios, a skill that had been roughly sharpened with years of listening to LiveATC.com where the slightest radio miscue was a daily occurrence. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.

Just to get a sense of what my CFI had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Denver Center, not far below us, controlling daily traffic in our sector. While they had us on their scope (for a good while, I might add), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to ascend into their airspace.

We listened as the shaky voice of a lone SR-71 pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied:""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""

Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.

Just moments after the SR-71's inquiry, an F-18 piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground."" Boy, I thought, the F-18 really must think he is dazzling his SR-71 brethren. Then out of the blue, a Twin Beech pilot out of an airport outside of Denver came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Twin Beech driver because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Beechcraft 173-Delta-Charlie ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, that Beech probably has a ground speed indicator in that multi-thousand-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Delta-Charlie here is making sure that every military jock from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the slowest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new bug-smasher. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""173-Delta-Charlie, Center, we have you at 90 knots on the ground.""

And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that my CFI was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere minutes we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Beechcraft must die, and die now. I thought about all of my training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.

Somewhere, half a mile above Colorado, there was a pilot screaming inside his head. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the right seat. That was the very moment that I knew my CFI and I had become a lifelong friends. Very professionally, and with no emotion, my CFI spoke: ""Denver Center, Cessna 56-November-Sierra, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Cessna 56-November-Sierra, I show you at 76 knots, across the ground.""

I think it was the six knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that my CFI and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most CFI-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to 72 on the money.""

For a moment my CFI was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when Denver came back with, ""Roger that November-Sierra, your E6B is probably more accurate than our state-of-the-art radar. You boys have a good one.""

It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable stroll across the west, the Navy had been owned, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Slow, and more importantly, my CFI and I had crossed the threshold of being BFFs. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to our home airport.

Many european languages especially have strong dialects due to the amount of time people have been speaking them there in those somewhat isolated environments. I don't speak Spanish, but I have heard how insanely different spanish sounds in Mexico, different parts of spain, Cuba, etc, and that is only the pronunciation. There are certainly also different words for things. In many parts of Europe, most people are able to speak the textbook version of their language (in german it is called High German), but they spend most of their time speaking the dialect which is much harder to a school-based learner to understand. 

I am convinced that the only viable way to learn a language is to actually go to that country AND be forced to speak it (just going on an exchange trip with your 10 friends from your class isn't gonna help you at all if you all speak English the whole time). You may not know the weird word for a sandwich the day you get there, but once you go into a shop and try to order one and they tell you what it is called, you will not forget it. When I first got to Germany, I went into a deli and tried to ask for turkey (sliced meat). It was my first day in the country, first day outside the US at all, and I really stupidly thought that maybe the word Türkei (the country) would also work.

Simple fact is: There are millions of pissed off Ukrainians and only about 110,000 Russians for combat, the rest are logistics. Simply running the UA's unit's down will help the Russians in the short term but in the long run - it doesn't solve shit for them. They don't have the supply lines to *capture and hold territory* is my main point. They have no more troops to ship in. Kherson is already starting to rebel and more smaller cities/towns are rebelling as well. That ties up Russian BTG's that could be used elsewhere. 

 My hope is that that UA division of units on eastern front will fall back tomorrow before that happens. It will stretch the Russian lines even more out. The Russians aren't even sending bushwhacking teams. They are sticking to the roads only. 

The Russians are also running out of time on the economic clock. They only have an estimated $30 billion in Foreign Currency to pay off their debtors according to[ this FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/3f1c7151-93ed-48ff-a23c-496320919621). And that's to pay the bills. And things will only get worse as time goes on as they can't pay the 200 or so billion dollar bill they need to *run their country each month.* 

The goal at this point for Ukraine is to play for time. The longer it takes to do stuff, the worse it gets for the Russians and they have already minorly shifted their negotiation positions *twice* today. But it's enough to know the pressure is getting to them. I don't think the Russians have the time needed to actually fulfill their plan of encirclement or do a bombardment.

each attack is one battle in a day.

Russia cares less if they're attacked because they'll strike two cities in different NATO countries for every single attack.

there's no just automatic decision if you bomb me, we bomb you..

or if you bomb our ally we bomb you, esp if they've already showed they're not bluffing about nukes....

if NATO responds with force as you say... Russia queues missiles for the capitals of every NATO country and every state and province in Canada and USA....

congrats nobody wins.

but if Russia say waits a few months with their prize of Finland then decides eh let's go for Poland the same exact way... nobody will again stop them.

it's the trolley problem.

there's a trolley and two lanes it could take: one hits a family of 5 with 3 young children, the other 7 elderly adults...

which one do you take?

well there's a lot of thought to decide, the kids are young and could provide a lot of value to the world.

but there's more fatalities if you hit the elderly group...

Putin's logic is more like if I got both groups I don't need to make a choice and I don't even care who dies so what's the point of this exercise?

in other words each strike by the west is going to weigh out a similar trolley problem... which guarantees less loss of life, surrender to a mad man or retaliate and create a chain reaction of retaliations until humanity is annihilated...

Putin has nothing to lose if he's that hell bent, hell there's a good chance he might end up executed for war crimes already for what he's done, so yeah might as well go for full world domination...

MAD as a protection is a fairy tale they told us about to make us feel safe during the cold war. In practice the madman will win unless we call his bluff, and his nukes fail because they suck at maintaining things, or America has secret anti nuke shields to bring them down without detonating them...

We're the only ones capable of understanding the stars, comprehending atoms, appreciating and creating music, art, and poetry.

The only ones who raise pets, bringing life into the world for the sole purpose of caring for, nurturing, and loving it.

The only ones who help after a disaster, who organize humanitarian relief efforts, who at least *try* to prevent stuff like this because we know it's wrong.

The only ones who strive to build a society of moral order, and free of suffering, even if we don't always succeed.

Humans have done a lot of bad things. But we are also the only ones who've ever done anything good.

...On Earth, anyway. Though we haven't found anyone else yet, and our existence certainly isn't relevant to them.

Other species don't give a fuck about war or peace, hate or love. They wouldn't know either way. They follow their base urges and instincts until they either can't eat or get eaten, then die a painful death.

 >The madman theory is a political theory commonly associated with US President Richard Nixon's foreign policy. Nixon and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think he was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response. Some international relations scholars have been skeptical of madman theory as a strategy for success in bargaining.

> Survive? There's no greater scope in this. We just came alive and we strive for survival, that's it.

You're looking at it the wrong way. Exploiting resources doesn't mean wasting it. It means using it.

Sometimes that is waste and sometimes, we do what only humanity does best. We bring purpose to the purposeless.

There's a rock on the ground, what is its purpose? Well, it has none. It's just a rock. It's there. I pick that rock up and now its potential is limitless. I might use it to bash against wood to cut and shape it in order to craft a shelter or a tool. I might stack it in order to create a wall or bridge. I might grind it down to dust, sift that dust based on its chemical makeup, and craft a dozen different products out of what I get.

Let's go larger.

Look at Mars. In the absence of intelligent life, what is Mars going to do across the Sun's remaining several billion years of life? Absolutely nothing. The likelihood that a train of comets is going to come flying in and slamming into Mars to give it a biosphere is so close to zero as to be considered ""not happening"". Mars will do nothing and have no effect on the universe in any fashion. But then clever humans come along, we look at it, stroke our chins a bit and say ""Hrm...I think I can use that."". Deploy our technologies to redirect comets from the Oort cloud over, and inside of a couple centuries Mars has not just a breathable atmosphere, but a thriving biosphere. Sure, without a magnetosphere the solar winds will burn away that atmosphere over the next 5-10 million years (assuming we don't find some way to solve that). We humans might kill ourselves one way or another, but the animals we'd bring to Mars would live on. Several million years is a long time. Who's to say another intelligent species wouldn't evolve the spark of sentience and continue forth?

And that's the other thing. If we don't die in the process, we're GOING to go to the stars one day. And we aren't going alone. We'll be bringing the genetic information of basically every damn creature on the planet, and quite likely the technology with which to clone and artificially birth them.

Imagine horses, elephants, and giraffes on a thousand worlds under a thousand different suns.

WE can do that. Right now, there's no known creature in existence besides us that is capable of this.

The ability to manipulate your environment inevitably opens up the possibility of negative actions and consequences. ALL species deal with this. Predators kill prey animals, and they do so in violent and agonizing ways in most cases. If you remove the predators, you're reducing the suffering of the prey animals right? Wrong. The prey animals will breed to the limits of their ecosystem to sustain them. That sounds nice doesn't it? Perfectly balanced (as all things should be). Except that idea of balance obscures the horror of what it is. When a herd of elk has it's population artificially limited by some form of predator (be that mountain lions or human hunters), they end up staying far away from the limits of their ecosystem. As such, every member of the herd has the ability to achieve a full and varied diet. Their life is eternally at risk of course, but it is also as comfortable as an elk can get while in a natural setting. Remove the predators and what you inevitably get is a herd of elk that grows until it hits that magical balance point. The point at which there's JUST enough ability of the surrounding ecosystem to give each individual elk JUST enough food to not die of starvation. Each and every moment filled with a desperate hunger, constantly fighting with others of the herd for another bite of foliage. In the limited herd scenario, a fight between elk CAN leave members dead, but in many cases the injured party backs off and recovers. They have the excess calories to handle an expensive healing process. In the max-herd scenario, they don't. Sickness is rampant, even minor injuries a death sentence. Your herds exist unchecked in a boom and bust cycle where the population explodes, mass starvation kills them off, and then the population shrinks down to the point where the foliage can regrow. Repeat the process, until one day a new predator evolves to act as a check against this endless cycle of suffering, by providing a new form of suffering.

We have numerous examples of the cruelty of which animals can choose to engage with others. Species of one animal that kill members of another on sight, for no discernable reason. Species that engage in war with themselves (all the way down to ants and all the way up to primates and other higher order animals).

Removing humanity doesn't actually CHANGE anything. The world will still find ways to bring about pain and agony to itself, with or without us.

But just because ""life is suffering"" doesn't mean that life doesn't have it's good parts either. Animals of all species enjoy play, and clearly experience a joy of some kind in the process. The feeling of contentment of a full belly, lazing about on a warm spot during the fading sun is near universal. Various intelligent species enjoy the puzzles that life brings before them. Birds trying to figure out how to break open nuts and such for example.

For all the harm that humanity can and does bring to the world, there is much we have to offer as well, much that nothing else that we know of CAN offer in our stead. To assert that the world would be better off without us is selfish at worst and foolish at best.

While I don't believe it's truly possible to have a species which is incapable of the sorts of logical scenarios that inevitably lead to wars and needless conflict and suffering, humanity surviving to terraform and colonize a million stars will present the greatest possibility to the universe of such a species evolving.

That is our duty. To bring purpose to the purposeless.",1646729048.0,1646728833.0,t3_t98pp8,t1_hztc1s5,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

What Russia is doing is completely reprehensible, but this does not align with ANY of the signals of genocide. We can't even say that we're in the first stage (classification). 

Attacking civilians is a war crime, but not automatically genocide. The attacks are indiscriminately planned, with no central “goal”. 


Compare this disgusting war with the genocide in Rwanda. In Rwanda, 

1. An estimated 400,000 people were killed 

2. The hutus developed a program to identify Tutsi. 

3. The tusti were rounded up and brought to mass killing areas. 

4. The hutu looked to destroy entire villages and bloodlines. Women had babies literally cut from the their wombs. 

5. The presidential guard had a mandate to spare nobody. Every civilian they saw needed to be killed.

The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore, but it's population does. The population of Crimea view themselves as Russian. Therefore the territory should be Russian. This ain't complex. From what you say, it seems you want the territory to be back under Tatar control... Real dumb take. Please use your brain. Local populations should decide what country they are part of. Research into the Crimean population shows they are happy to be part of Russia and support the annexation. Who are you to say they are wrong?

Your argument would be fine if the actual people of Crimea made this decision, if it wasn't an operation in a series of operations against Ukraine by Russia, if it wasn't the same propaganda spewed forth by the 21st century embodiment of hitler. but it wasn't made by them, it was a Russian operation, and it is the same propaganda. there are no nuances here, no they did but they did but THEY did; one side is 100% wrong and the other is 100% right, and you have to choose sides. because not chosing is equivalent to choosing the side that is in the wrong (I'm not eager to explain this to you, good luck out there)",False,1646730272.0,t3_t98pp8,t1_hztfaq5,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

There have been Western backed studies into the annexation of Crimea and the views of the local population. They agree that the people of Crimea support the annexation. Are you saying they are wrong to support it? It's their home, not yours.

Whilst the method of annexation is highly questionable, although there is definitely a case to defend it. The invasion of the rest of Ukraine is indefensible and has clouded people's judgement about all of Russia's foreign policy and claims over territory.",False,1646731042.0,t3_t98pp8,t1_hztfs5y,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
