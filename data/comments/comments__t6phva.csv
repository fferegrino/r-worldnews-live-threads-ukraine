* [This article](https://www.sandboxx.us/blog/russias-high-profile-weapons-are-all-smoke-and-mirrors/) goes into more detail about how Russia oversells its military capacity.
* Russian leadership vastly underestimated Western response, expecting another Crimea.
* Supply lines & logistics were not adequate at all, related to above point.
* Ukrainian resolve has been overwhelming & military response highly effective.
* Zelensky was expected to flee, instead emerged as the new standard in political leadership.

Of course the days and weeks ahead are still full of peril as Russia increasingly targets civilian populations in an attempt to break Ukraine's resolve.

Autocrats around the world are shitting their pants at whats happening in Ukraine and Russia.  This is for two reasons, first the crippling economic sanctions on Russia that have devastated its economy practically overnight. Autocrats with much smaller and more vulnerable economies are looking on absolutely stunned. 

The second is the utter incompetence of one of the main ‘counterbalances’ to western military power, the Russian army. The world sees that Russia is a paper tiger with extremely limited ability to project power beyond their borders. 

This is also obvious evidence that autocratic regimes are actually weaker and much more fragile than democracies. For decades now autocrats have been able to buck the democratic world because they perceive democracies as weak and themselves as strong. That perception is absolutely vital for their own legitimacy. 

The last 2 decades have been a story of democracies in decline and autocracies on the rise all over the world. We are finally seeing what the free world is actually capable of. I hope Ukraine and the resistance of her people will be a symbol of a great turning of the tides. 

Of course I dont want the west or NATO or any other power in the free world to go on the offensive and start bombing autocratic cities. The free world will win because their system of governance and open society is inherently and unequivocally better for humanity.

>Among those openly expressing their dissent are healthcare workers. A group of nearly 12,000 doctors, nurses, and paramedics signed a letter addressed to Vladimir Putin expressing their opposition to the war and asking for its end.

3.	The new Sanctions mean that they won’t have enough money to maintain current readiness levels, even after subtracting the losses. I won’t even get into how impossible it is going to be to replace the lost tanks, planes and expended munitions.

The suspect, identified as an “agent of Russia’s military intelligence agency (GRU)”, is currently detained in Przemysl - near Poland’s border with Ukraine on Sunday night, ABW said in a statement.

The note released by the Police said he was of Russian origin.

ABW said the man carried out operations to benefit Russia and travelled in Europe and elsewhere under the cover of being a journalist.

His lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Reuters he had not yet been able to contact his client. He tweeted earlier that his client had been charged with espionage and was being held in Rzeszow prison.

Spain’s foreign ministry said it had been informed by Polish authorities of the charges but could not provide any details. It said it would offer consular assistance.

“Before his detention, he was planning to go to Ukraine in order to continue his activity,” said Spain’s foreign ministry.

Do you think they really believe Russia should return to some sort of USSR that never really worked?

When Russia's second largest oil company is now openly speaking out against the war, among many artists, local politicians, oligarchs, etc. you really do have a problem, even as a dictator.

Surpressing only goes so far, especially when you're fighting a war and other ""breakaway"" regions such as Georgia, Moldova (Transnistria), etc. are suddenly signing up to the EU/NATO as well (latter is the case for Kosovo).

Putin has to know he's fighting a losing war by now, that is, if he was still surrounded by even semi-competent advisors/cabinet members.

The sad thing for him is he got rid of anyone slightly critical of the corruption going on, and now only has sycophants around him, who are too scared to tell him anything he doesn't want to hear.

The Russian drive past Mykolaiv in the South must cross a huge expanse of mud, drones, and angry Ukrainians (not to mention rear-actions from Odessa, Uman, and Kryvyi Rih, as well as whatever Mykolaiv itself can spare). On the other side of the Dniepre, Zaporizhzhia has to be taken before Dnipro, both very large and defendable cities. Dnipro itself will be an absolute monster to take due to the river chokepoints without the Eastern or Northern forces assisting, which I don't see happening.

From the East, even if the miracle at Kharkiv finally ends, forces from Poltava would threaten any corridor toward Kyiv.

I'm still concerned about Chernihiv, though. A reliable corridor to the eastern side of Kyiv will slow down any Northern counter-offensive toward Ivankiv.

Overall, Russian VDV and mechanized forces have proven absolutely ineffective on every front. That said, everything between Mariupol and Kherson appears within Russian control unless we see a concerted push to liberate Mariupol and conduct a counter-offensive for Berdyansk (there's no evidence that this is possible).

[Volunteer Hackers Converge on Ukraine Conflict With No One in Charge](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/04/technology/ukraine-russia-hackers.html)

>The hackers have claimed a number of disruptions over the past week, blurring the lines between amateurs and groups linked to governments.

>The hackers came from around the world. They knocked Russian and Ukrainian government websites offline, graffitied antiwar messages onto the home pages of Russian media outlets and leaked data from rival hacking operations. And they swarmed into chat rooms, awaiting new instructions and egging each other on.

>The war in Ukraine has provoked an onslaught of cyberattacks by apparent volunteers unlike any that security researchers have seen in previous conflicts, creating widespread disruption, confusion and chaos that researchers fear could provoke more serious attacks by nation-state hackers, escalate the war on the ground or harm civilians.

>“It is crazy, it is bonkers, it is unprecedented,” said Matt Olney, the director of threat intelligence at the security firm Cisco Talos. “This is not going to be solely a conflict among nations. There are going to be participants that are not under the strict control of any government.”

>The online battles have blurred the lines between state-backed hackers and patriotic amateurs, making it difficult for governments to understand who is attacking them and how to retaliate. But both Ukraine and Russia appear to have embraced tech-savvy volunteers, creating channels on the chat app Telegram to direct them to target specific websites.

Edit: added Threadreader unroll - https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1498723689264816128.html

**Jan Nedvidek:**

I work in the aviation sector, and I can tell you that for all intents and purposes Russian aviation has - at best - about **three weeks** before it’s show over.

One aspect is the fact that airspace available to Russian aircraft is very, very limited now. However, there is more:

Very few aircraft are actually owned by airlines, and instead most are owned by lessor companies, most of which are Irish. Under the sanctions regime, the view in the legal community is that those leases have to be terminated, otherwise Irish companies will be criminally liable.

More importantly: Russian operators are unable to effect insurances. Without those, no national aviation authority will allow access to its airspace.  This would in effect mean the end of Russian operators flying internationally.

Furthermore, despite the presence of some Sukhois, Ilyushins and Antonovs, the bulk of aircraft operated in Russia is still Boeing and Airbus. Those use CFM, GE and Rolls Royce engines.

All these manufactures have cut off access to repair manuals without which the aircraft and engines cannot be serviced. They have also issued a global ban on servicing in other countries, so that Russian aircraft cannot be flown abroad for maintenance.

They have also stopped the supply of spare parts. From talking to our clients, I understand most airlines keep about a **2 or 3 weeks worth of spares supplies**.

What does this mean? Russia will be in effect cut off from international travel, perhaps with the notable exception of China. It will be more isolated than the USSR, and even domestic journeys will be severely limited.

Sanctions - if drafted well - do work.",1646421750.0,1646421447.0,t3_t6phva,t3_t6phva,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

The UK prime minister said the changes will “ramp up the pressure on those criminal elites trying to launder money on UK soil”, ensuring they have “nowhere to hide”, PA news agency reports.

The amendments to the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Bill will “help streamline the current legislation so we can respond even more swiftly and effectively to the current crisis in the way we sanction individuals”, the Foreign Office said.

The FCDO said the provisions will allow the UK to align more rapidly with the individual designations imposed by allies such as the US, Canada and the EU.

The changes also include shortening the length of time foreign owners of UK property will be given to declare their true identity under a new register of overseas entities, from 18 months to six months.

Criminal penalties for non-compliance are set to increase from fines of up to 500 per day to up to 2,500 per day under a further amendment.

Serbians rally in support of Russian war in Ukraine
Around a thousand demonstrators rallied in support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the Serbian capital Belgrade as they chanted anti-NATO slogans and showered praise on Putin.

The demonstrators chanted “Serbs-Russians, brothers forever” as they marched through central Belgrade, lighting road flares and waving Russian flags.

“Ukraine is being liberated from neo-Nazis. Russians — our brothers — are liberating the country, and hopefully the world,” Nikola Babic, a 22-year-old security guard, told AFP news agency.

Here’s where we stand now:

Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, was seized by Russian forces on Friday, after an attack that started a fire close to one of its six reactors. No release of radiation was reported, but Ukrainian officials said workers had not been able to check all the safety infrastructure in the wake of the attack.

An emergency of the UN security council was summoned following the attack on the Zaporizhzhia NPP. The US ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the world narrowly averted a “nuclear catastrophe” and condemned Russia’s actions as “reckless” and “dangerous”.

Seven people were killed, including two children, after a Russian air strike hit a rural residential area in the Kyiv region on Friday, Ukrainian police said. Police said the strike hit the village of Markhalivka, around 6 miles from the southwestern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital.

The Ukrainian city of Mariupol has no water, heat or electricity and is running out of food after coming under attack by Russian forces for the past five days, its mayor said in a televised appeal. He called for a humanitarian corridor to evacuate civilians from the south-eastern port city.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia.

Nato foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace, Stoltenberg said. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs.

Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces. Russia’s Novaya Gazeta newspaper said it will remove material on Russia’s military actions in Ukraine from its website.

The BBC is temporarily suspending the work of all its journalists and staff in Russia. BBC director general Tim Davie said the new legislation appeared to “criminalise the process of independent journalism”.

Russia’s media watchdog Roskomnadzor said it had decided to block access to the Facebook network in Russia. It added that there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020.

More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children.

The UN human rights council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against.

In one sense, we're already fighting World War III and arguably have been for many years. It just wasn't conventional warfare.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare

5th generation warefare is still a form of war, and Putin's regime and oligarchs have been undermining stability in the west and agitating extremism since at least 2014 when the Obama era sanctions began. Perhaps earlier.
Those of you who remember social media history should realize that 2014 was a key year for a huge amount of social destabilizing movements in the english speaking world, especially online. BLM rose and was co-opted by troll farms to sew as much division and possible and undermine it. (This is NOT me in any way condeming BLM itself. By and large, I personally support the movement.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_Black_Lives_Matter

GamerGate rose from the chan boards that summer and completely overtook the website, it later became a huge rallying point for the alt-right and the same demographics that would later evolve into radical online Trump support. It got so bad that the original 4chan founder was ousted from the website. This became an extension of the MRA vs Feminists movements which were already likely being fanned by Russia as well.

The more we learn, the more we realize that Brexit also has heavy ties to Putin. Brexit was also predicted in what is essentially Putin's political Bible in ""The Foundation of Geopolitics"" as far back as 1997.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum

The rest of 2016 speaks for itself.

2017 started QAnon on 4chan and that spiraled into its own thing with early russian backings. From QAnon we got antivaxxers and just about every other extreme right wing movement. And in all these years, militant white supremacist movements got huge boosts too.

There has been a substantial change in people's behavior since I'd say about 2012 onward, but 2014 was when it really started to take off and far right fanaticism in the west truly began to be amplified. And all of it benefited Putin.

Putin has been at war with the west and literally any form of western democracy for at least 8 years already. Only in the past week has the west finally started using economic means to truly fight back.

Here are Johnson’s full comments from an interview he did with El País:

[Interview question]: You said in the House of Commons that Putin is a war criminal. Should the West aspire to put this war criminal in front of an International court, like Milosevic or the Nuremberg trial?

[Johnson’s answer] What I certainly believe is that there is a close analogy between Putin’s behavior and the last years of Slobodan Milosevic. It’s very interesting that both leaders had been in power for a long time, both increasingly autocratic, both seeking to shore up their domestic position, and found a great nationalist cause. Slobodan Milosevic identified the birthplace of Serbian nationalism, indeed the Serbian nation, in Kosovo Poljie, and he inspired his people with this misbegotten idea that it needed to be rescued and liberated. There’s a very close sort of analogy between that catastrophic mistake, and what the president of Russia has been saying about Kyiv and the origins of Russian religion and culture and civilization and his objectives in Ukraine. When it comes to the International Criminal Court, that’s a matter for them. There would have to be the gathering of evidence. If there is evidence of the use of illegal munitions, cluster bombs, barrel weapons, this clearly will have to be brought to the Netherlands.

This is a small piece of the overall Sberbank capital structure,” the agency said. “TRS’s remaining exposure to holdings in Russia is proportionately negligible in a portfolio of about $26 billion,” the agency said.

Look how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. I want mutually assured destruction. It’s the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they’re playing the long game. They figure in the long run it’s worth it. Which I disagree with. But it’s not about Ukraine

Kinetic energy squares with the velocity of the force, therefore velocity is a greater factor in kinetic energy output than the mass of the item in consideration.

When discussing rocket munitions you not only have the kinetic energy of the impact (in this case traveling over the speed of sound, and remember kinetic energy scales with velocity) but you also have the chemical and mechanical energy of the warhead itself. 

Kinetic energy formula = 1/2mv^2

A Kalibr missile has a 450kg warhead attached to it. 

I’d have to do the math and research the warhead compound and whether the rocket had a second stage propellant in order to do an apples to apples comparison of the destructive force of a Kalibr missile versus the downing of a 737 (most common passenger aircraft).

But something to think about. Because surviving the impact of a plane crash versus the impact of rocket munitions are two totally different things.

Everyone who says “get rid of your leader” that’s like telling North Koreans to get rid of Kim. Russia has tried. They’ve tried voting, he rigs elections. People run against him, he locks them up or kills them. People protest, he arrests them. I’m so sick of seeing everyone say “do more!” Like it’s as easy as flipping a switch. It’s not. So be mindful of what you say about Russia and Russians. Millions and millions and millions of people are going to suffer for a very long time because of this. I was adopted right after the fall of the Soviet Union. I’m an example of someone who was directly affected by economic collapse; my birth mother couldn’t afford to care for me. I thank her for being so brave and strong, and it hurts to know that there will be so many kids who won’t be as fortunate as I was. I agree, it’s sucks and Putin is wrong in doing this, but I feel worse for the helpless people that will pay the price for this in Russia. I’ll always be proud to be Russian. I’ll always love Russia. Im fortunate enough to be in a position in America where I can be Russian, and be anti Putin, and support Ukraine all without facing repercussions.

Their soldier's sent into a country under false pretences by that delusional cunt Putin and are being massacred not even knowing why they're there. Their economy destroyed because there's no other option to oppose the sheer barbarity being inflicted in Ukraine by Putin. Their reputation ruined by their governments own lies and propaganda.

I honestly hope Putin's government collapses over this but I also hope that this will force any other person in a leadership position that Russia need's to end this belligerent crap and clean itself up at all levels. Their country's going to be broken in the short term after all of this. The only way they truly have out of this to avoid a repeat of the 90's in the long term is to basically modernise, purge the corruption in the same way as Ukraine has and clean itself up.

Ukraine in 8 year's of shaking off Putin's Kleptocratic influence went from a disorganised messed to an extremely formidable country. Russia could easily have this as well if it followed suit. Whether there's anyone there who would have the leadership and the charisma to make this happen is another question entirely though.

Regardless it was Putin's failure to learn from history that has brought his country low. Should Russia get a new government and end this farce in Ukraine it will ultimately have to face some consequences of Putin's Government but if it engages with other countries actively it wont be abandoned or disproportionately punished either. One of the lessons of WW1 was overzealously punishing Germany and laying the foundations for the 2nd World War that had even more tragic results.",1646428260.0,1646427986.0,t3_t6phva,t1_hzcr0ac,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

they've been funding stuff all over the political spectrum, because the more conflict the better & the Russian state is pretty devoid of any genuinely held ideological values besides ""obtain power, wealth, control"" but on the extreme right, worldwide, they are *everywhere*  you look   


wonder why all those hard right-to-naziism/fascism style political groups and movements came popping up abruptly around 2014-15 all over the west?  

Wasn't because of Trump, Le Pen, Bolsonaro et. all's influence - it was, just like the views & messaging the aforementioned people have exhibited have been: entirely backed by, and in the interests of, the Russian state.

That claim isn't without merit - but it's also not watertight. First - we need to realize that political-diplomatic commitments were not uncommonly being made without being put in writing, and still treated as binding - so that alone is not quite sufficient to completely put NATO in the clear.

Then we need to realize there were conflicting statements about what was said by various parties. The facts seem to be that James Baker had floated that promise in return for giving up the GDR, that this was not put in writing, and that the different sides say that promise was/wasn't made verbally - with the US (obviously) claiming that was merely an ""idea floating around"" (which sounds played down) and Russia claiming that they were definitively promised this (which sounds played up).

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

The same thing happens whenever there's news of storms in the Gulf (any of them), stuff shutting down, tankers having issues, despite the overall supply not being impacted.  

Also consider this.  You have a tanker of oil.  Germany is desperate and willing to pay HUGE amounts if you send that tanker to them.  The US isn't desperate so only willing to pay normal amounts.  So you do the logical thing and sell it to Germany.  The next tanker available also goes to Germany.  

Well now other places have less coming in, so offer more to compete and get enough supply.  

So you end up with a combination of factors, people like me and my SO who filled up our tanks at the start of the invasion expecting prices would go up.  We weren't the only ones, future investors also imagined prices would go up.  So they invested now figuring they'd sell their investment at a profit.

Then there's the Oligarchs, whose loyalty to Putin is really being tested.

Feels a bit like everyone in Russia is waiting to see what it looks like after the war is over. If they can force Ukraine into signing a peace treaty that favors Russia and see many of the worst sanctions lifted. Which might be how it goes down. Any country that was on the fence will say that ""now the war is over, and Ukraine + Russia have agreed to peace, our sanctions no longer have a purpose, and we can lift them.""

If Russia takes Kyiv, that is almost certainly how it goes down. I don't think Russia will ever break Ukraine, and they will never truly win.

Russia still is actually expected to win this war. The only issue they will face is whether they are actually willing to go full Stalingrad and battle for every street in the bigger cities.

Don't get me wrong. This has been completely shambolic so far by the Russians. They made so many miscalculations it isn't even funny.

But the reality on the ground is that they are warcriming and shelling civilians in cities and turning those cities into rubble in the process. And we are barely 1 week into this war that might take months and potentially even years.

There is a giant difference between an offensive stalling (which this has but only in their quest to conquer the bigger cities. They sadly have done decently in the South and East and the Ukrainians are in trouble on that front).

Let's be real. Donald Trump COULD have become what happened in Belarus. And he really tried. He really tried fighting the fact that he lost and tried to rile his own base to stay in power - after all, unlike Belarus, the military wasn't on his side.

In the end dude...we're emotional, rationalizing animals. Humans brains don't cope well with constant duress, trauma, or threats of death. While I feel the Russian people have no choice anymore but to stand up and fight - let's not pretend that being threatened with jail or death isn't an effective deterrent to speaking out against authority. And if all of your friends and supporters start dying, dwindling in numbers or giving up - morale drops. Objecting seems pointless. 

I'm not saying Russians shouldn't protest. I am saying that I don't blame the Russian people for feeling burnt out, afraid, and frozen in terror about all of this.

- The rise and fall of Russian Oligarchs. This is the documentary that probably explains what happened in Russia in the 90s and why Putin has been so popular since then. It shows you how Putin lined up oligarchs to serve the Kremlin and not the other way around like in Yeltsin/Berezowski era.

- The assassination of Russia. This is a french documentary about Moscow bombings of 1999 that boosted Putin's popularity. It's based on the book of Litvinenko (former FSB officer who escaped to London and was killed by Moscow with Plutonium). This paints Putin much differently than the one before, as a bloody sociopath that killed hundreds of Russians to motivate a war to boost his popularity.

- Putin's Kiss. This documentary goes more into press freedom in modern Russia and how Putin's entourage created a very unfriendly climate for free press from mang point of views.

I believe those 3 are among the best documentaries you can watch to get a feel of how we got to today's situstion in Russia and you can find them all for free online.

I would also like to know some other docs I didn't see. just please no shitty biased American docs like the PBS shit.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Ukraine can not take them on head-on. The strategy is to defend the cities (because in urban combat the defender has a giant advantage) and to wear them down by targeting supply lines, splitting them up as much as possible and then destroying them tank by tank small convoy by small convoy.

b6ac6f84bcb33f9b5186bda6b4c8b399,t6phva,hzcup0r,"Finland and Sweden might join NATO extremely quickly. Joining NATO is usually very slow because of a few major factors:

**1) Standardization.** NATO STANAG requires the member states to follow specific processes, procedures and terminology for military procedures and equipment. Basically, to join NATO your armed forces must function like NATO does and have compatible equipment. (And be able to function in English or French, the two official languages.)

**2) Article 10.** Any new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty.

**3) Finances.** NATO must be able to trust that the prospective member state is going to be able to spend as much as NATO expects on their military.

**4) Information security.** NATO must be able to trust that sensitive information will not leak our of the new member state.

For many countries, for example Serbia, Ukraine or Bosnia and Herzegovina there are some challenges in all these sectors. There are worries that someone in the Serbian armed forces might be loyal to Russia and sell them information - for example.

However, Finland and Sweden already functionally operate like NATO. Their armies basically train like NATO and practice with NATO. They are in fact in many technical ways more technologically NATO-STANAG -compatible than some current NATO-members.

edc355cea479734e726f9eaab8a277e1,t6phva,hzcn1fq,"I've been wondering lately if Russia allocated themselves a set amount of military resources for Ukraine. Some very smart people (i.e. Fiona Hill) are positive that Russia's ambitions don't end with Ukraine, and if that's the case they may already be planning ahead for multiple fronts. They may have allocated themselves X% of their military capabilities for Ukraine, and aren't willing to throw ""good money"" away on what they're seeing as a front that is only one of several and has already eaten more of their resources than they wanted to spend.

It's like if you're on a set, very tight, budget, and you allocated yourself $200 for car expenses. Your car breaks down, and you get an estimate of $200 to fix it. You spend that $200, only to find out that the issue isn't fixed, and your car still isn't running well. It's getting you where you need to go, but you get there slower and it's not a very comfortable ride. It's embarrassing, and it might hurt you if it breaks down completely at the wrong time, but you have the self control to not spend more money on that car, because if it's developed multiple issues, then it's likely to just keep developing more and more, and eating up more and more of your money, when you'd rather be putting that money towards a different car.

Substitute in ""quickly conquering Ukraine"" and you might have a fair allegory. It seems like they're still making progress, albeit slower than they'd like, and as long as they can eventually subjugate Ukraine, they aren't willing to allocate more than the budget, because they know they can't replace these losses, and they'll need everything they have for other areas. 

Or maybe I'm just completely off-base.

- part of a currency's value is based upon the countries which accept it as payment and will pay with it. If that's only China then they hold a heavy hand over how well the Ruble is valued.

- a system is needed to convert your currency to another for quick payments. That means without swift Russia would need their own. That system will be much weaker, prone to intrusions and problems than SWIFT is.

- Russia cannot supply every single good they need in the country. That means they have to get it either from China or through China which slows the process. It also makes it hard for them to diversify imports if it's all coming through China. It also puts China in a large station of power over Russia.

- Because of having to go through another country that increases the number of middlemen they have to use. That increases costs which increases prices.

A lot of his newer planes were ran way over their limits for material stresses. There is no way they have had time to do serious repair on all of it. In Ukraine he was facing an already heavily dense AA theater (the ukrainian AA is *old* but so is the majority of russian airframes, and they have **a lot**. Then in the matter of just 2 weeks, the same theater was made *supersaturated* with short range AA (the natural counter to medium and high-range AA is to go in low and fast) , and this short range AA of a higher quality than what Ukraine already had. This happened in a timeframe where there wasnt time to compensate in the invasion plans. Especially so since its come out later that the invasion planning was kept secret to anyone byt the highest echelon of Kremlin. They pushed forward with air assets anyways, and within 2 days had lost both a helicopter they had bragged had never been shot down, a transport plane full of VDV, multiple jets, AND it turned out the ukrainian pilots had more training hours, their initial attack to knock out the ukrainian airforce largely failed because they were prewarned, ukrainians had an eery 6th sense of russian raids (they had real time intel delivered) and losses were mounting up quickly.

&nbsp;

Then it turned out the russian troops arriving were NOT met with willing colloborators, the ukrainian command and control were in full control and unaffected and russian troops got bogged down east and north, with only limited progress south. And the west, in unison, started rattling their sabers. Necessitating an operational readiness on other borders. And catastrophe struck; the ukrainians captured russian AA  assets that had not been incapacitated, and got hold of the russian IFF's.

&nbsp;

Russian air command suddenly were facing a world of shit. Their ready asset numbers were always a bluff, and their pilot pool has been limited because of available funds.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Gorbachev had his hand tied up by Yeltsin and the leaders of the Baltic States following the acknowledgement of the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

**1) Standardization.** NATO STANAG requires the member states to follow specific processes, procedures and terminology for military procedures and equipment. Basically, to join NATO your armed forces must function like NATO does and have compatible equipment. (And be able to function in English or French, the two official languages.)

**2) Article 10.** Any new membership requires ratification by all current signers of the treaty.

**3) Finances.** NATO must be able to trust that the prospective member state is going to be able to spend as much as NATO expects on their military.

**4) Information security.** NATO must be able to trust that sensitive information will not leak our of the new member state.

For many countries, for example Serbia, Ukraine or Bosnia and Herzegovina there are some challenges in all these sectors. There are worries that someone in the Serbian armed forces might be loyal to Russia and sell them information - for example.

However, Finland and Sweden already functionally operate like NATO. Their armies basically train like NATO and practice with NATO. They are in fact in many technical ways more technologically NATO-STANAG -compatible than some current NATO-members. As for information security and military spending, I think the current NATO-countries can trust Finland and Sweden to not tell Russia their secrets or be lazy about spending enough.",False,1646423099.0,t3_t6phva,t1_hzcm6m5,,3,14,0,14,0,0,

That's right, but Crimea and mainland Russia are seperated by the Kerch Strait. 


So it's true, they have the military base in Sevastopol, but there's no so-called land bridge to from Russia to the base. I'm guessing that makes the logistics of maintaining the base more difficult. 


Furthermore, the Ukrainian badasses built a dam (after the illegal annexation of Crimea), cutting off the supply of fresh water to Crimea. 


The purpose of the Kerch Strait bridge is not only to connect Crimea and Russia. The other reason is that it enables Russia to block off the Sea of Azov because it's built so low.
