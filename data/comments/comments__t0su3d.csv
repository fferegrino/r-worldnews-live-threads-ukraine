The Ukrainian special services once again figured out Putin's scenario. But this time it is not only about the method of attack, but also its goals. ZN.UA received the information below from its own sources.

According to the operational plan of the Russian Federation, up to 2 thousand special forces are planned to capture one of the two airports in Kiev and air traffic control facilities, the indicated number of military personnel will ensure the arrival of the main group of forces in the amount of up to 10 thousand paratroopers by Il-76 aircraft, along with light armored vehicles and regular armament of the airborne troops (armored personnel carrier, Nonna, cars).

The landing operation will be controlled from the A-50 aircraft, which will be in the airspace of Belarus and the Russian Federation.

The first part of the landing may arrive from Belarus by helicopters or light aircraft.

At the same time, sabotage groups that are already on the territory of Ukraine must commit sabotage at power grids and substations in order to disconnect a significant part of the city from the power grid and communications, which will cause panic among the population.

According to the plan, separate groups of provocateurs should organize arson and acts of looting in order to further sow panic and focus the attention of law enforcement agencies on stabilizing the situation with public safety, and not on searching for saboteurs.

At this time, there will be a massive cyber attack on the authorities and other vital sites in Ukraine.

Before that, activation will take place at the front, provocations are possible along the entire border line with Ukraine, which will force the military-political leadership to take the bulk of combat-ready troops to the defense line, so a small number of troops will be in Kiev.

The task of the landing force is to block Kiev, communications, command and control channels, seize / blow up arsenals, sow panic as much as possible, create conditions for a panic exit from Kiev of ""uncontrolled columns of refugees"" that will block highways / roads, which will complicate the movement of troops, law enforcement agencies on the roads Kiev.

Further, to capture and control the main authorities - the OP, the General Staff, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and hold them until the arrival of the main forces.

A day is given for the landing operation, the beginning - as soon as it is ready, late in the evening or at night.

The DATE of the operation is unknown, it is expected in the coming days, depending on the weather, the development of the political situation in the world and the negotiation processes.

The desired result is to seize the leadership of the state (it is not specified who exactly) and force them to sign a peace agreement on Russian terms under blackmail and the possibility of killing a large number of civilians.

Even if part of the leadership of the state is evacuated, one of the pro-Russian politicians will be able to take ""responsibility"" and sign documents, citing the ""flight"" of the political leadership from Kiev.

As a result, Ukraine can be divided into two parts - according to the principle of West and East Germany, or North and South Korea.

At the same time, the Russian Federation recognizes as legitimate that part of Ukraine that will sign these agreements and be loyal to the Russian Federation. Guided by the principle: ""who controls the capital controls the state",1645757908.0,1645757829.0,t3_t0su3d,t3_t0su3d,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

My thoughts. Why would Russians/Belarussians be moving Ukranian bodies? They have them loaded into back of civilian cars. They would do that if it were their own guys?

Hence the emphasis on quickly decapitating the government. 200k offense, even with equipment advantage, is not enough to beat a nation of 44 million with a (lesser-equipped) 300k army of its own (figure includes reservists). 

  
Note the US sent 180k into Iraq which was far weaker than Ukraine. It still took three weeks to take Baghdad. Even the complete collapse of Afghanistan took a couple weeks. Does Putin have a couple weeks?

  
Of course, Russia hasn't actually committed everything yet; maybe Kiev falls this weekend. But what if it doesn't?

  
What happens if Russia is clearly losing when the first week is out? Authoritarians dont survive losing wars, I don't think so anyway. Putin is smart enough to know that. So he can't lose. 

  
Hence, in the event of preliminary Ukrainian victory, it really goes two ways. Either A) a negotiated ceasefire, with enough concessions to Russia to allow the ruling regime to call it a win back home and remain in power. That is the only way they would agree. Or B) massive, massive bloodshed and civilian casualties as Russia levels population centers to force Ukraine to surrender.  Again, some risk of popular uprising back home, but at least they'd be winning.  


Some people will say ""B"" is unthinkable and a war crime. Sure, but ""war crimes"" are decided by the people who win wars, so Russia need not care about that, provided they win in the end. Destroying population centers is not unprecedented and not unthinkable. Russia leveled Grozny, and that was home soil. The USA nuked Japan rather than spend the blood to take it conventionally. Russia wants Kiev and won't destroy it. But Lviv? Or some other random towns? They can choose cities in Western Ukraine they care less about and make examples of them if they choose to. If the optics of nukes are too bad, they can firebomb them.  


That's the worst case scenario.   


The implication is that Ukraine and Western leaders need to be thinking about what they can propose that lets the Russians choose option A. Taking an absolutist line (""no concessions, you get nothing, go home"") most likely makes them choose ""B.""

“🇺🇦 Ukrainian special services found out Putin's plan to capture Kiev by paratroopers.

Goal: The Kremlin wants to create ""two Ukraines"".

•As ZN.ua writes, according to the operational plan of the Russian Federation, up to 2 thousand special forces are planned to capture one of the two airports in Kiev.

•Further, up to 10,000 more paratroopers will arrive in the capital by Il-76 aircraft along with light armored vehicles.

•One of the tasks is to seize the Ukrainian government and, through blackmail, force them to sign agreements on Russia's terms.

•Even if the authorities have time to evacuate, one of the pro-Russian political puppets will head the government, arguing this with the flight of the previous leadership.

•As a result, Ukraine can be divided into two parts - according to the principle of West and East Germany, or North and South Korea.”",False,1645757629.0,t3_t0su3d,t3_t0su3d,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

a single plane flown low altitude directly into Kiev early morning, and then shot down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems. the only explanation for this is Russia wants to evaluate the AA capabilities of the capital. it may have been unmanned. they are trying to figure out where to land their paratroopers.

i don't think we will see a big siege of Kiev today. it will be a blockade with perhaps surgical strikes to take out anti-aircraft equipment. once that is all done and the airport is re-taken, there will be a large paratrooper landing in the controlled airspace.

This has many similarities to how it was living under Trump and his constant gaslighting. The Russian people are a victim of this despot - even those who have been indoctrinated by his propaganda.

He also suggested Ekaterina Shulman as being very helpful for “removing the fog from his eyes” about what was going on in Russia years ago.

Of course, Ukrainian air defenses could have made a mistake and shot down their own fighter. There were numerous friendly fire incidents between ground-based air defense systems and aircraft during the 2nd Karabakh War and 2008 Russo-Georgia War

1.) Taiwan’s exports highly overlap with South Korea’s, wouldn’t the latter be able to easily fill in the supply gap caused by a potential invasion on Taiwan?

2.) The world is more reliant on Taiwan compared to Ukraine, but it is also more reliant on China compared to Taiwan or Russia. Which is why the EU tends to be very careful about the words it uses to describe Taiwan.

3.) Historically the US has never deployed forces to defend a country that it is not obliged by law to defend. The fact that the US is not giving up on strategic ambiguity (like how NATO wouldn’t accept Ukraine) regarding Taiwan is the sign that the US will not use forces to defend Taiwan in case of an invasion.

4.) Taiwan’s chips make it more of an incentive for China to invade, more so than Ukraine is to Russia. A bloc with Russia’s natural and military resources, China’s market and manufacturing capabilities, and Taiwan’s technology would be a formidable self-sufficient force that not only shrugs off sanctions from the West but also rivals the West itself. Scary.

NATO Air Base (NAB) Geilenkirchen, Germany, is home to 14 AWACS aircraft.

> The active surveillance sensors are located in the radar dome (“rotodome”), which makes the AWACS such a uniquely recognisable aircraft. This structure rotates once every 10 seconds and provides the AWACS aircraft with 360-degree radar coverage that can detect aircraft out to a distance of more than 215 nautical miles (400 kilometres).

* Trump shared intelligence with Russian ambassadors and met with Putin off the record!! Which was shocking at the time but makes even more sense now

There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

And frogs in the pools singing at night,
And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

Robins will wear their feathery fire
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

And not one will know of the war, not one
Will care at last when it is done.

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree
If mankind perished utterly;

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
Would scarcely know that we were gone.

Russia has done nothing to neuter Ukraine's CNC, communciations, or electrical networks.   They have used only a tiny fraction of the amount of air power they can deploy or the amount of armor they can bring to bear.

If you're in a position like that, you don't hold back and probe and play the long game like people seem to suggest when explaining it here.   You overwhelm with staggering firepower and combined arms superiority, before the enemy can rally and coordinate a coherent defense in depth/counterattack strategy, as we're seeing here.

According to the operational plan of the Russian Federation, up to 2 thousand special forces are planned to capture one of the two airports in Kiev and air traffic control facilities, the indicated number of military personnel will ensure the arrival of the main group of forces in the amount of up to 10 thousand paratroopers by Il-76 aircraft, along with light armored vehicles and regular armament of the airborne troops (armored personnel carrier, Nonna, cars).

The landing operation will be controlled from the A-50 aircraft, which will be in the airspace of Belarus and the Russian Federation.

The first part of the landing may arrive from Belarus by helicopters or light aircraft.

At the same time, sabotage groups that are already on the territory of Ukraine must commit sabotage at power grids and substations in order to disconnect a significant part of the city from the power grid and communications, which will cause panic among the population.

According to the plan, separate groups of provocateurs should organize arson and acts of looting in order to further sow panic and focus the attention of law enforcement agencies on stabilizing the situation with public safety, and not on searching for saboteurs.

At this time, there will be a massive cyber attack on the authorities and other vital sites in Ukraine.

Before that, activation will take place at the front, provocations are possible along the entire border line with Ukraine, which will force the military-political leadership to take the bulk of combat-ready troops to the defense line, so a small number of troops will be in Kiev.

The task of the landing force is to block Kiev, communications, command and control channels, seize / blow up arsenals, sow panic as much as possible, create conditions for a panic exit from Kiev of ""uncontrolled columns of refugees"" that will block highways / roads, which will complicate the movement of troops, law enforcement agencies on the roads Kiev.

Further, to capture and control the main authorities - the OP, the General Staff, the Cabinet of Ministers, the Verkhovna Rada and hold them until the arrival of the main forces.

A day is given for the landing operation, the beginning - as soon as it is ready, late in the evening or at night.

The DATE of the operation is unknown, it is expected in the coming days, depending on the weather, the development of the political situation in the world and the negotiation processes.

The desired result is to seize the leadership of the state (it is not specified who exactly) and force them to sign a peace agreement on Russian terms under blackmail and the possibility of killing a large number of civilians.

Even if part of the leadership of the state is evacuated, one of the pro-Russian politicians will be able to take ""responsibility"" and sign documents, citing the ""flight"" of the political leadership from Kiev.

As a result, Ukraine can be divided into two parts - according to the principle of West and East Germany, or North and South Korea.

At the same time, the Russian Federation recognizes as legitimate that part of Ukraine that will sign these agreements and be loyal to the Russian Federation. Guided by the principle: ""who controls the capital controls the state.""",False,1645758218.0,t3_t0su3d,t1_hyby0c4,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

so he's about to go kaboom and might bomb Ukraine, nukes or not, he wants to bomb Ukraine.

I think Ukraine used to be a part of Russia and now they want it back? Idk. It seems weird that Putin's decided to do it now.

1. He's gone insane.
2. He's got nothing to lose (he might be terminally ill, or knows that his presidency is already fucked, etc).
3. It's a distraction (the COVID situation in Russia has been really bad apparently).
4. He wants something from Ukraine (I think someone mentioned oil?).
5. He doesn't just want Ukraine and he's planning to go full WW3.

Unfortunately, I don't think it's an either/or situation.

2. As more and more former USSR countries join NATO, Putin could be worried about having enemies in his front lawn. Aka no buffer countries between him and EU.

2. No one wins a nuclear war. It's just Brinkmanship from putin to try and back down NATO. Because putin knows that the US stance is any nuclear strike against a NATO ally will be seen as an attack on the US, and will result in a full retaliatory strike. Aka mutually assured destruction. Hence why nuclear war has not happened. 

This is however the closest in a long time the major powers of the world have come to war. The economic sanctions are tools our great grandparents didn't have. And we still have more we can do to Russia assests and its oligarchy. 

Putin is not a stupid man. He knows this. And there is no sense in committing your people to death to save face. You can't expand your territory and influence if your nation is a burning nuclear wasteland. 

Long story short. Ukraine will either make this such a bloody war that pressure at home and from the Russian armed forces will force putin to back down and take some meager gains. 

Or Ukraine will be conquered fully. Sanctions will be brought to their highest point. And the world will wait to see if Russia survives economically.",False,1645759832.0,t3_t0su3d,t1_hyc119j,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This is a completely reasonable analysis -- I just don't know how close we are to this point, or if Ukraine (both the government and formal military structure as it stands today) will be able to hold on. Because frankly, it seems rather inevitable that Russia will accomplish their strategic and territorial goals of this operation in the short term. 

Mid to long-term, I agree, resistance both domestically and within Ukraine may be what leads to this operation ultimately failing. But I don't think the loss of a few hundred or even thousand soldiers (who largely seem to be conscripts, as you said), a few dozen tanks, and a handful of aircraft are even close to enough to put the breaks on the operation.

I'd be careful using videos of protests to take the temperature of the citizens for an entire nation. A few thousand protestors in a few major cities certainly does not mean that Putin is feeling any type of pressure to cease this operation.

NATO vs Russia or if Russia pulls allies isn't as easily winnable as some may think, this isn't battleship, the movie, you say you served I believe above, you should know that unless you again don't understand the actual logistics.

Ukraine does have some issues that make it not worth us not joining but I won't elaborate because that is controversial.",False,1645760294.0,t3_t0su3d,t1_hyc2qp0,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

It's a largely symbolic move as NATO's direct budget is relatively small, at about $2.5 billion, and is separate from national defense budgets that NATO recommends should stand at 2% of GDP.


US defense officials tell CNN that the Trump administration sought to reduce its contribution to about 16%, bringing it in line with Germany's, which provides 14.8% despite the US having a larger economy.


US and NATO officials told CNN that the other NATO members are expected to make up the shortfall.

Trump has long slammed NATO allies, particularly Germany for not meeting the 2% NATO defense spending target, which only eight of 29 members currently meet. All members pledged to reach the 2% level by 2024 but not all of them currently have plans to do so. Member countries have boosted defense spending considerably in recent years, something Trump has claimed credit for.

NATO officials including the Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have also credited Trump for the rise in spending, with an extra $100 billion spent since 2014 but have also acknowledged the increased threat from Russia following its seizure of Crimea and other factors have helped to prompt the increase.
