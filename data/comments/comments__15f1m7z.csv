>  
>The young drone squad barged into the base camp near here, boots thumping across the floor where other Ukrainian soldiers slept, as smartphones sounded a 3 a.m. wake-up call.  
>  
>“Good morning, Vietnam!” one shouted, as the recon team, several of them still teenagers, rousted others. They talked and joked as they collected electronic gear and ammo from their makeshift headquarters, a community center in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region. One wore cowboy boots and a bush hat.  
>  
>In the moonlight outside, the soldiers loaded weapons, Mavic drones, and other supplies into a camouflaged pickup truck, then sped off through the ruins of several Ukrainian villages toward the front.  
>  
>For the young drone pilots of 78th Regiment, it was the start of another day in a trench, glued like gamers to the video screens of their drone controllers and staring across a no man’s land at heavily fortified Russian positions as artillery thumped and whistled around them.  
>  
>Their job was to hunt enemy targets with drones in a war that, for some of them, has been going on for more than half their lives. They are part of a generation of Ukrainians that has virtually no memory of peacetime. Now, they wrestle daily with split-second decisions that could mean life or death for themselves or the enemy soldiers they target.  
>  
>Vadym, 19, the fast-talking, wisecracking merry warrior of the bunch, is typical. He was 10 when Moscow invaded Crimea and \[...\] eastern Ukraine in 2014. When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a massive invasion in February 2022, Vadym had just turned 18 — draft age.  
>  
>For most of the youngest soldiers, the war with Russia in the eastern Donbas region seemed far away when they were growing up — a kind of simmering background music that occasionally touched relatives or friends. Now, however, they are on the front, fighting a powerful enemy that can, and does, strike anywhere.  
>  
>Vadym said he was aware that playing rock and roll in the trench was his way of coping with, and perhaps romanticizing, a hellish experience.  
>  
>“For me, Bob Dylan works the best,” Vadym said. “I just became a really big fan of Bob Dylan since the beginning of the war. I mean, a very beautiful song of his is ‘Hard Rain is Gonna Fall.’ It’s just so metaphorically great.”  
>  
>Then, as artillery sounded in the background, Vadym cued the song, and Dylan’s voice asked: “Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?”  
>  
>“War has changed all of us. It changed our perspective on how we see the world,” said Oksana Rubaniak, 20, who grew up in a Carpathian mountain village. Rubaniak was an excellent student who threw herself into Ukrainian history, including Kyivan Rus, the first great Slavic empire, and thought she might become a teacher.  
>  
>When Russia invaded last year, Rubaniak helped evacuate people from Kyiv, joined a territorial defense unit and eventually became a machine-gunner who first saw combat near Bakhmut.  
>  
>She was recently injured, taking shrapnel to the head, shoulder and neck in fighting near Vuhledar, but plans to rejoin the fight now that she has recovered.  
>  
>For Kyril Kharkovsky, 19, war turned his family into evacuees and has elevated him to a position of responsibility faster than he ever imagined. Kharkovsky commands a platoon, a promotion that came only months after he started fighting.  
>  
>Until joining the military, he had never fired a gun, and the only warfare he had seen was “Counter-Strike,” a popular tactical combat video game in Ukraine. He, too, was a kid when he first saw the Maidan protests on TV, with scenes of riot police opening fire on pro-democracy demonstrators.  
>  
>“All these protests, the fighting, the shooting — already at the time I thought, ‘How can this be?’” Kharkovsky said. Yet, even with Russia’s seizure of Crimea in early 2014 and fighting in Donbas, the idea that war would engulf his family seemed far-fetched. Then Russia invaded and occupied territory, including his hometown.  
>  
>After three months under occupation, his family relocated to Lviv, where he enlisted. By early spring, he was in combat near Bakhmut. “It was scary,” Kharkovsky said.  
>  
>He carried a grenade launcher on the front lines. By late June, he was a platoon leader. That, too, was scary. “How is that I’m the youngest,” he wondered, “and I have to command everyone older than me?”  
>  
>Vadym, too, has been given heavy responsibilities, first in a mortar crew, then as a drone pilot.  
>  
>As the sun peeped over the horizon, Vadym settled into the trench for another day of drone warfare. U.S.-provided M777 howitzers lobbed shells so high the soldiers counted 15 seconds before they hit.  
>  
>“Compared to Bakhmut, it’s like going to vacation, you know?” Vadym said. “No one’s trying to, like, kill you every five minutes.”

Video version of the report with spokesman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Oleksandr Shtupun: https://youtu.be/FQw4lHaywqk  
  
Glory to Ukraine!  
  
Day 524 of the russian full-scale military aggression against Ukraine has begun.  
  
The russian federation continues to ignore the laws and customs of war, using terror tactics, striking and shelling both military and civilian targets.  
  
During the day of 31 July, the enemy launched 9x missile and 57x air strikes, 61x MLRS attacks at the positions of Ukrainian troops and various settlements.   
Unfortunately, the russian terrorist attacks have killed and wounded civilians, including children. Residential buildings were destroyed.  
   
The likelihood of further missile and air strikes across Ukraine remains very high.  
  
During the day of 31 July, there were more than 40x combat engagements.  
  
Volyn and Polissya axes:  
no significant changes.   
  
Sivershchyna and Slobozhanshchyna axes:  
the adversary launched an air strike in the vicinities of Stepne (Sumy oblast) and Udy (Kharkiv oblast).  
The enemy fired mortars and artillery at more than 30x settlements, including  
Sen’kivka, Tur’ya, Bleshnya, Buchky (Chernihiv oblast),  
Mefodiivka, Sytne, Starykove, Mohrytsya, Stepok, Ryasne (Sumy oblast),  
Udy, Veterynarne, Starytsya, Vovchans’k, Nesterne, and Budarky (Kharkiv oblast).

The invaders continue shelling settlements, including Berdychi, Avdiivka, Pervomais’ke, and Karlivka (Donets'k oblast).  
  
Mar’yinka axis:  
the enemy launched an air strike in the vicinity of Krasnohorivka.  
The Ukrainian Defence Forces continue to hold back the russian forces’ advance in the vicinities of Mar’yinka and Pobjeda.  
The adversary fired artillery at several settlements, including Mar’yinka, Pobjeda, Heorhiyivka, and Hostre (Donets'k oblast).  
  
Shakhtars’ke axis:  
the enemy launched air strikes in the vicinities of Vuhledar, Blahodatne, and Staromaiors’ke.  
Near the latter, the invaders made unsuccessful attempts to regain the lost position.  
The enemy continues shelling the settlements of Vodyane, Vuhledar, and Blahodatne (Donets'k oblast).  
  
Zaporizhzhia axis:  
the adversary focuses its main efforts on preventing further advance of Ukrainian troops.  
The occupiers launched air strikes in the vicinities of Malynivka and Mala Tokmachka (Zaporizhzhia oblast).  
The enemy fired artillery at more than 15x settlements, including Levadne, Hulyaipole, Zaliznychne, Orikhiv, Stepove, and Kam’yans’ke (Zaporizhzhia oblast).   
  
Kherson axis:  
the adversary continues to maintain its military presence.  
The invaders fired artillery at more than 25x settlements,  including Dmytrivka, Ochakiv (Mykolaiv oblast), Mykhailivka, Dudchany, Beryslav, L’vove, Kherson, and Dniprovs’ke (Kherson oblast).   
  
At the same time, the Ukrainian Defence Forces continue to conduct the offensive operation on Melitopol’ and Berdyans’k axes, consolidating their positions, and firing for effect at the enemy.  
  
The russian occupiers continue to use civilian infrastructure in temporarily occupied settlements.  
Thus, the enemy placed about 100x russian troops in the premises of the miners' sanatorium in Nyzhnii Nahol’chyk (Luhans'k oblast), and more than 100x occupiers were placed in the buildings of an educational institution in the village of Semykozivka (Luhans'k oblast).  
  
During the day of 31 July, Ukrainian Air Force launched 7x air strikes on the concentrations of enemy troops and 3x air strikes on the anti-aircraft missile systems of the adversary.

>\[3:20\] Putin has got to do something now to upgrade his war efforts. He can't just allow the slouching, corrupt, ossified generals to do it, so he's scrambling and looking for ways to succeed. He had allowed these private military companies to form and to participate in battle. What ended up happening is that he had a bunch of people who became all too powerful \[...\] and didn't show loyalty to him. So he's stuck in a place where his normal military generals don't work, he can't have PMCs because that threatens his own power, and so he's looking for any way to turn this thing around.  
>  
>\[5:38\] In any society where you lose a quarter million young men there's got to be pressure, there's got to be cracks. I think the first sign of that was this aborted mutiny by Prigozhin.  
>  
>\[7:03\] Well, I don't believe that there's any chance of any kind of negotiated deal whatsoever. Putin has never, in the 23 years he's been in power, ever shown any ability to negotiate or compromise. \[...\] If he were to do that it would show weakness, and Russia is a country that despises weakness. \[...\] I don't see any negotiation on his side. The Ukrainians were very keen to negotiate in the first weeks of the war; I remember \[Zelenskyy\] effectively begging for negotiation. But after the unbelievable number of atrocities, war crimes, deaths, kidnappings, rapes, and trillion-dollar property damage, I don't see the Ukrainians giving up an inch of their territory.  
>  
>\[8:25\] And furthermore, I don't think that NATO and the US and the UK want Ukraine to capitulate in any way, because everybody understands that if Putin is allowed to get away with this, he's gonna have another go and eventually he'll have a go at NATO countries. Whatever fantasies people have about peace treaties -- those are just fantasies.  
>  
>\[9:45\] Putin has created this image over the last 20 years that he's indispensable, that he's the only one who can hold Russia together, that he's better than the alternative. \[...\] Here we are in a situation where this is the third war that Putin has launched \[...\] He's a terribly dangerous man, he's threatened nuclear war, he's now embarked on a food war with the world (by restricting wheat exports to Africa), and environmental war (by blowing up a dam and flooding Southeast Ukraine). \[...\] This man is a menace to the world and we should do everything possible to \[...\] defeat him on the battlefield and then let the chips fall where they may.  
>  
>\[13:02\] If Chechnya wants to become independent, if Tatarstan wants to become independent, it's none of our business to get involved with that. Our business is to ensure that Russia doesn't pose a risk to the civilized world. We appeased Russia and Putin for two decades, and this is what we end up with: hundreds of thousands dead, millions of refugees, huge economic costs around the world. We should be absolutely tough on whatever comes next. It's not our business to regime-build in Russia, just make sure that the incentives are there so they don't do this again.  
>  
>\[14:36\] This war started in 2014 when Russia took Crimea. That was an act of war and it's continued since then. The war's been going on for nine years now, and will probably go on for another nine years unless we give the Ukrainians what they need to finish this thing.  
>  
>\[16:15\] I think the Putin regime is on its last legs. He has overextended himself with this terrible war; he thought it would be a three-day war to shore up popularity and instead it will be the war that ends his power. \[...\] It's so hard to predict these things. No one can really predict how it's going to play itself out, and certainly the person can't predict it the most is Putin who's sitting there scared to death every day that he's going to be hung from a lamppost.",False,1690919982.0,t3_15f1m7z,t3_15f1m7z,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump was indicted on felony charges Tuesday for working to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the violent riot by his supporters at the U.S. Capitol, with the Justice Department acting to hold him accountable for an unprecedented effort to block the peaceful transfer of presidential power and threaten American democracy.

>
>Last September, Ukraine requested Western tanks from allies to push back against Russia’s invasion. At that time, Russia had not consolidated much of its hold on the territory it had taken. While allies debated whether or not they should send tanks, Russia began to dig in:
>
>Sept. 4, 2022: When Ukraine first requested Western tanks, satellite images show that Russia had only started to build fortifications.
>
>Jan. 25, 2023: By the time Ukraine finally received the tanks, half a year later, hundreds of miles of fortifications were visible from space.
>
>Take the occupied city of Tokmak in Zaporizhzhia Oblast as an example: This is how the city looked in satellite imagery on Oct. 18, 2022.
>
>Over the next two months, Russians set up barriers outside the major roads into the city. By Jan. 26, the entire city was surrounded by fortifications.
>
>The pattern then repeated itself. Ukraine publicly asked for cluster munitions from the United States last winter, shortly after it had liberated the southern city of Kherson. The Biden administration delayed responding to the request. Meanwhile, this is what happened in occupied territory:
>
>Dec. 8, 2022: When Ukraine requested U.S. cluster munitions, most of Russia’s new fortifications were concentrated near the front line.
>
>July 6, 2023: Six months later, when Ukraine finally received the cluster munitions from the United States, Russia had fortified huge swaths of occupied eastern and southern Ukraine, along the border and throughout northern Crimea.
>
>Without fear of Ukrainian-operated Western tanks or long-range missiles, Moscow’s soldiers were able to expand defenses close to the front line and deep within occupied territory.
>
>These positions generally consist of trenches, anti-vehicle barriers and land mines. Michael Newton, who leads the land-mine-clearing operations in Ukraine for the HALO Trust, describes Russia’s mine-laying in occupied Ukrainian territory as taking place on an “industrial level.”
>
>The network of fortifications consists of a primary defensive line and multiple layers of fallback positions. This means that not all of Russia’s trenches are manned, but they provide ready-made fighting positions aimed at stalling a Ukrainian advance.
>
>Here are some illustrative examples:
>
>Russia took the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk in July 2022. New fortifications between the city and a nearby oil refinery underscore its importance to Russian forces.
>
>Located by the Black Sea, Berdyansk Airport is a base for Russian helicopters operating over occupied regions in southern Ukraine. Russian forces put up extensive barriers and trenches around it earlier this year.
>
>Closer to the front line, Russian forces constructed layers of fortifications along the 50 kilometers of highway that connect the occupied cities of Polohy and Tokmak.
>
>Even in Crimea, occupied by Russia since 2014, satellite images show new defenses along roads leading into the peninsula.
>
>The pattern of delay is still in place. Ukraine has been asking for long-range missiles it would like to use to strike Russian command posts, staging areas and supply depots behind the front lines. The United States is once again dragging its feet.
>
>Whether it is worries about escalation, or worries about supply shortages, the smart bet in Washington is that the long-range missiles, like the tanks and the cluster munitions before them, will ultimately be delivered.
>
>If the last year of the conflict has shown anything, it’s that this kind of vacillation is costly. It not only squanders additional Ukrainian lives, but it also makes a protracted, grinding conflict more likely.
>
>Ukraine’s allies have long recognized the frantic pace at which Russia has been building defenses in occupied territory. But this realization had little bearing on the speed of their own decision-making. That needs to change. Instead of uncomfortably looking on as Ukraine’s counteroffensive devolves into a slow war of attrition, Western leaders should become more proactive.

Either they are incredibly stupid and risked open war or the pilots made a mistake and accidentally flew into Polish airspace.

For all we know they were seconds from being shot down, NATO air defense is going to be monitoring that whole area now and won’t allow this to happen a second time.

This isn’t like China flying close to Taiwanese airspace or Russia flying a bomber over the Baltic Sea but they actually flew over Polish land.

Here is the translation from one just today, from a local severdonesk publication. https://sd-ua.translate.goog/news/19837?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp

*earlier in war, when I’d post such, many people would defend the treachery by saying how people must still earn a living in occupation.  I’d like to preemptively reiterate that Ukraine still pays the teachers.  Ukraine literally still gives a salary to sit at home and refuse to cooperate.  However, Russia eventually cut off the banking system so such people could no longer access those salaries.  This forced the teachers to choose whether to go work for the Russians or to leave.  The different areas vary.  For example, Melitopol, most ended up leaving, with something like 8% cooperating.  However, in Mariupol, the number was much higher, like up in the 30s iirc. However that was who got the Russian certification, it wasn’t exactly how many taught, bc not enough children remained; but there was no longer access to payroll data and there was uncertainty on precise figures.  In any case, what Rada has made a crime is the implementation of Russian standards.  They aren’t teaching reading and math.  They’re doing things like reciting pledge of fidelity to Mother Russia every morning.  Homework assignments on Nazi Kyiv and Savior Moscow. That Ukrainian heritage doesn’t exist, that it’s a perversion by mentally ill Russian traitors.  And that these children are Russian.

add barrel degradation

or how any shift in artillery strength in ukraines favour will likley only increase their chances to go after artillery batteries

Since then, the Russian government has attempted to arrest him multiple times through fraudulent Interpol warrants.

The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober. A rival’s coercive nuclear threats have little or no credibility when the balance of resolve favors us, and it is worth remembering that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ever engaged in successful nuclear blackmail during the long Cold War—even against non-nuclear states— despite the enormous arsenals at their disposal.

they are in Germany. Nazis just don't call themselves Nazis, they call themselves something else, and they adopt other symbols to circumvent the banned ones. It's really fairly easy, I don't see why the Ukrainian Nazis would be unable to do the same.

If you have any evidence of any Nazi elements within Ukraine breaking any Ukrainian laws related to Nazism (or any other laws for that matter), then by all means bring it to the attention of Ukrainian authorities, so they can be prosecuted.
