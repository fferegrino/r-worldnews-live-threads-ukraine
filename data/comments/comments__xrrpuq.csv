Day 219 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, there was no shelling, missiles were fired once, but they weren’t aimed at Kharkiv, and landed somewhere in Khrakiv oblast. They launched them at a weird time as well, at 6:50pm, which was very sudden as it was very early for missiles; usually they almost always fire them after dark.

Those bastards continue to intentionally target civilians. In the morning they fired a bunch of missiles at a big civilian convoy heading from Zaporizhzhia to the occupied territories, killing at least 30 people (including 2 children) and injuring at least 88 more. What the fuck do they get out of killing civilians? Do they just do it for their sick pleasure? The people they killed are the people that they supposedly want to “protect” as they live in Zaporizhzhia, which they are saying is now part of Russia, even though they don’t even control it.

Putin’s speech was just enraging; they are truly living in their own reality, which has nothing in common with ours. You can literally just change any “The west” and “Ukraine” in his speech to “Russia”, and then everything he says would be correct, he would be perfectly describing Russia. Putin is saying Russia is anti-colonial on the same event where they are illegally annexing territories of another country? Does he even hear what he says?

It’s funny that they are acting like they have just won the war, even though literally nothing has changed. They also never talk about Lyman, as if it doesn’t exist for them, along with any of their soldiers that still remain there. Will they just stop talking about any territory that they lose as if it doesn’t exist? But they can’t do that anymore, because now they consider those territories Russian, so now they will be losing parts of Russia from their own point of view, which will make every defeat seem much worse in their eyes.",False,1664586206.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,146,0,146,1,0,

>In a move that follows a plodding and predictable script Russia will recognise the four territories it has occupied and captured in conquest. Under the country’s 1993 constitution there needed to be a popular vote for this to happen - hence the hurried fake referenda.  
>  
>Like other autocratic police states pseudo- legalism is of the utmost importance in Russia - we’ll hear a lot more turgid legal language today as a way of giving this international outrage a veneer of legitimacy. By moving to annex Russia has overturned centuries of convention - that you don’t steal land with force.  
>  
>Putin is also returning Europe to a period pre WW2. For the Kremlin though there’s logic and need. Domestically the annexation allows Putin more room to argue that Russia’s ‘Special Military Operation’ is not an offensive but defensive manoeuvre. There was no invasion. Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson are now, according to Putin, part of the motherland.  
>  
>Mobilisation is therefore not only justified but necessary to fight off a wider attack by the west. The Kremlin is signalling it is now battling not a limited war but an unlimited existential war. That’s the sell to the public.  
>  
>What he’s hawking to the west is a bit more nuclear blackmail. As part of Russia these four occupied regions will fall under Moscow’s nuclear umbrella - is it worth WW3 by continuing to support Ukraine?  
>  
>And in the upside down world of Putin’s Russia reality doesn’t matter. The fact that Russian forces don’t even control all of the area he’s about to annex - which is about the size of Portugal - can be glossed over. The war of liberation continues and even if it means bombing his own new subjects.  
>  
>This morning in what appears to be another egregious Russian war crime a convoy of civilians were killed in a missile attack. At the time of writing 28 wounded and 25 dead according to officials in Ukraine. The bigger picture of all of this is that this crisis just got a bit worse. Putin is signposting that - despite manpower shortages and major setbacks on the battlefield - he’s not giving up. Any chance of a negotiated settlement is now non-existent.

> ""The battle for Liman: the situation is difficult, ours launched a counterattack to prevent the enemy from cutting off the garrison of the city

> •The enemy created crossings across the Seversky Donets and accumulated large forces - perhaps in the region of 10,000 militants, where there are several thousand mercenaries.

> The heroic garrisons of Liman and Drobyshevo from the fighters of the LPR, Cossacks and volunteers of the BARS ""Russian Legion"" and BARS ""Kuban"" with the support of the artillery of the RF Armed Forces have been repelling enemy attacks on this sector of the front for almost 2 weeks.

> •In recent days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were daily attacked by armored groups from three directions. At night, HIMARS missiles and NATO 155mm howitzers flew over the reconnoitered positions of our soldiers. 1 time the rocket hit the BC warehouse, but it did not explode (now you can write about it). ⚫Our artillerymen were deployed from different sectors of the front, which helped a lot to contain the enemy.

> •The enemy continued to transfer reserves, intensifying the onslaught. •In recent days, during the stubborn battles, the BARS-16 fighters left Novoselovka, Drobyshevo, on Fri. Yampol was abandoned by our troops. The enemy came close to Liman and attacked from five sides. In the evening, the consolidated group of forces of the Western Military District, with the support of the special forces of the Russian Guard, struck from the side of Torsky, throwing back the enemy, who was trying to tighten the throat of the ""cauldron"", but our forces are still not enough to stop the breakthrough of the front Our wounded soldiers were evacuated to the rear.

Looking at say Lyman in Google maps and then scrolling out, what immediately grabs one's attention is a common denominator in the Russian disaster at Kyiv, then Kharkiv, now Lyman -- it's the forested areas, where Russia has had extreme difficulty from basically day one of the invasion.  There is a band of forest from Kharkiv to Lyman, so one can see that the Russians losing control of the Lyman area give the Ukrainians access to continuing forest that eventually extends east to Severodonetsk and then beyond.

Having lost control of this band of forests, the Russians are going to find the coming season of mud no respite at all for their forces.  In fact, the Russians may simultaneously be finding themselves attacked every single night by Ukrainian special forces using hit-and-run attacks emerging and retreating to the forests, with all supply roads in the area subjected to mortar fire, while finding that the mud immobilizes Russian armor that previously could be pretended to be some sort of mobile reserve.

As noted in the comment below, observe how quickly Ukrainian forces have gone from threatening Lyman to now possibly threatening Kreminna, I think because of this line of forests going east.

In addition, Lyman was supposed to be the southern boundary of the natural defense line formed by the Oskil River, which should become much wider and non-easily bridgeable as the rainy season progresses.  But now Ukrainian forces if they take Lyman can completely break this Oskil River line -- and then where can Russian forces find a better natural line of defense east?

A loss of Lyman unravels the entire Russian front in this sector, and threatens much of Lugansk.  A collapse in Lugansk makes a mockery of any Russian hope for forcing a stalemate let alone resuming offensive operations after the muddy season.  It would become obvious to even the hardest of hard-liners that any hope of success in conventional warfare in Ukraine is over, and that no amount of mobilization can change that equation.",False,1664579287.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

- Medical provision for Russian combat troops in Ukraine is probably growing worse. Some newly mobilised Russian reservists have been ordered to source their own combat first aid supplies, with the advice that female sanitary products are a cost-effective solution.

- Medical training and first-aid awareness is likely poor. Some Russia troops have obtained their own modern, Western-style combat torniquets but have stowed them on their equipment using cable-ties, rather than with the Velcro provided - probably because such equipment is scarce and liable to be pilfered. This is almost certain to hamper or render impossible the timely application of torniquet care in the case of catastrophic bleeding on the battlefield.

- Russian troops' lack of confidence in sufficient medical provision is almost certainly contributing to a declining state of morale and a lack of willingness to undertake offensive operations in many units in Ukraine.

After endless speculation, we can now say it for sure: this is how Vladimir Putin responds when he is backed into a corner.

Throughout seven awful months of war in Ukraine, President Joe Biden has held to a steadfast line when it comes to the Russian invasion: his goal is to help Ukraine win while also insuring that victory does not trigger a Third World War. But as Russian forces have experienced U.S.-aided battlefield setbacks in recent days, Putin has reacted by ratcheting up the pressure. It’s far from clear how Washington will be able to continue to pursue both goals simultaneously, given that Putin is holding Ukraine—and the rest of the world—hostage to his demands. …

On Thursday, I spoke with the Russia expert Fiona Hill. She told me she believes there’s an element of self-delusion to much of the current commentary about the possibility of Washington and the West continuing to back Ukraine while avoiding conflict with Putin—who, after all, launched his war against Ukraine not in February but eight years ago when he invaded the country and illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula. As far as Hill is concerned, we are already fighting in the Third World War, whether we acknowledge it or not. “We’ve been in this for a long time, and we’ve failed to recognize it,” she said.

Her chilling thought raises a searing question about U.S. policy: If the goal is to avoid a conflict in which we are already fighting, then does the rest of Washington’s approach to Russian aggression need to be reconsidered? Hill’s line of thinking is one reason why there are increased calls from many Russia watchers not to kowtow to Putin’s demands at a moment when both his weaknesses and those of his system have been so clearly revealed.

❗ I call on the Ukrainian authorities to stop hostilities immediately. But the choice of these areas is made. Russia will not betray him
 
❗ The West has been looking and is looking for a new chance to weaken and destroy Russia, they are haunted that there is such a great country
 
❗️ The West has gotten away with everything so far
 
❗ A firm promise not to expand NATO to the East turned into a dirty deceit
 
The United States is the only country in the world to have used nuclear weapons twice. The United States, together with the British, turned many German cities into ruins without any need, the goal was to intimidate our country and the whole world.
 
❗ The US is still actually occupying Germany, Japan
 
❗ Explosions on gas pipelines were organized by the West
 
❗ The West is turning its arrows to Russia, they say, this is the source of your troubles. Again lie
 
❗ Only “political masochists and other followers of non-traditional political relations” are ready to live according to the rules of the USA
 
❗ Do we really want to have a Parent No. 1, No. 2 in Russia, are we completely crazy or something? Do we want our children to be told that there are genders other than sex?
 
❗ It won't be like before
 
❗ Truth is behind us, Russia is behind us

Sadly, I am here to rant a bit. This *is* a negative post. I would like to remind you that we may be in an echo chamber.

I am a Turkish citizen. I loathe our current government, and I have also realized that our people give at least *some* credit to Putin's words. The sham referandums? I have seen many Turkish people on Twitter say Ukraine should recognize them (out of sheer ignorance on this issue), I have also seen people applaud Putin's speech today because he also attacked the LGBTQ community.

We know that Russian referendums are null and void. We know that Putin is a scumbag who is trying to appeal to the far-right in the West. But many people in the world, in Turkey, in Africa, in Middle East, in India, in Persia, Pakistan, China, in East Asia, in South America... they give credit to Russia. They sometimes even belive their word. These sham referendums do serve a purpose in the world. Maybe their governments do not recognize the referendums, but people's opinions also matter.

As people who care about Ukraine, its innocent citizens who are dying, its brave soldiers who are fighting, we should also be aware that these ""silly"" plays find some ground in the world. It's the saddest reality of all. People do be like that, they are ignorant of reality. It is the sad truth. We should take it into account with what we do. We should work against it.

Personally, all I can do is downvote pro-Russian replies on Turkish Twitter. If you have better ideas on how to approach this, I would like to hear them.

This is a very sad post for me to write. I am truly disappointed with what I see. Please advocate for better education in your countries in general, people should be better able to protect themselves against the silliness of propaganda, especially from the Russians and the Chinese.",False,1664570447.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

Recall that an invasion of Ukraine was used to threaten Ukraine into not pursuing NATO membership, and then Russia invaded anyways despite Ukraine's assurances they would not pursue NATO membership.

NATO membership hasn't been on the table even after Russia invaded. Russia already did the unthinkable to prevent NATO ascension, and so Ukraine was totally in the clear (and before) to apply for NATO membership at any time since February 25th... but they didn't.

Ukraine brings NATO membership back into the picture to increase their bargaining position at the table in response to Russia's annexation. So now, for any diplomatic resolution to be reached between Ukraine and Russia, Russia will have to give up something in order to stop Ukraine from pursuing NATO membership.

Before the annexation, I think Ukraine didn't bring up a potential bid for NATO membership because of the threat of nukes. However, during this war the threat of nukes has been touted primarily in response to any action by Ukraine to violate the sovereignty of Russia. Now that Russia has expanded their borders to within Ukraine and into the conflict zone, Russia has essentially forced Ukraine over this nuclear red line. The red line has been crossed already now, because of the annexation.

What is Russia's response to this latest news now about Ukraine applying for NATO membership? Another nuclear threat? Well, Ukraine is already violating Russian sovereign territory in the conflict zone and they haven't nuked yet... Could it be reducing exports of gas to EU even more than they've been reduced already? Well, the pipelines are gone now, so that's that.

Russia cannot up the stakes anymore short of actually using nukes, and so Ukraine gets to up their stakes without repercussions, increasing their own bargaining chips at the negotiation table.

Since the use of nukes by Russia would precipitate the military and political defeat of all of Russia's strategic goals in Ukraine, it would be self-defeating. Russia isn't going to end itself, and potentially large swaths of the world, just to stop Ukraine from exercising its own independence.",1664574936.0,1664574640.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

Summary:

The list of “powers and means” actually available to the Kremlin is not very long. Here it is:

* Massive attacks on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure. On Sept. 16, Putin said that the strikes on electric stations in Kharkiv and Kremenchug were meant as “warnings” to the Ukrainian leadership. The energy infrastructure (being the most vulnerable) is likely to be targeted in a bombardment campaign.
* A tactical nuclear strike, or threats of using nuclear weapons, accompanied, possibly, by demonstrative use of such weapons in unpopulated areas.
* Economic measures against western countries that support Ukraine – for instance, a reduction of Russian energy exports in the winter.
* Continued mobilization until the Russian forces at the front reach numerical parity with the Ukrainian army, or else gain a numerical advantage.",False,1664568275.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Ukraine just announced its application to join NATO via an accelerated process. NATO application isn’t something you just announce unless you are trying to get some concessions from NATO members or are guaranteed to be admitted. Russia’s annexation of territory it doesn’t even occupy is enough of a provocative act and total breach of international law that it might bring NATO fully into the war. 

Annexation of territory you occupy does violate international law and generate an international response. However, the response is often anemic because it can be seen as reconciling the de facto state with the de juris one. 

Annexation of territory you do not occupy doesn’t just break international law, it violates the very foundations upon which international law exists. Fundamentally, legal possession and occupation are key in international law. There’s a reason why countries that hate Israel don’t simply annex its territory and instead attempted to invade several times. It’s not their land and they have no claim to it unless they occupy it. They can back the Palestinians, but they can’t outright annex Israel. No wonder NATO and the UN are responding so harshly.",False,1664554375.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

The actual response is the liberation of Lyman thanks to NATO training and weapons. Absolutely more that can be sanctioned (for those who say what left is there to sanction) and sanctions do work overtime, especially the longterm which we havent even hit yet.

820c6e0949aaa66cc06adf875a7209b1,xrrpuq,iqkynis,"Heya! American here. Since we're seeing a few more open-minded Russian and Russian-adjacent (i.e. relatives, etc.) accounts around today, I thought it might be helpful to pause and do a full rundown of the situation as seen from outside of the Putin propaganda bubble. Am I inside other propaganda bubbles myself? No doubt! But mine seem to have the edge in accuracy at the moment. So let's do this one last time:

 1. So you know how Putin said Ukraine isn't a real nation or culture? Yeah, the Ukrainians disagree.

 2. Followup: the Ukrainians really, *really* don't want you there. Like, at all.

 3. Yes, they will kill you all if you come for them. No, it's not very nice, but look at it from their point of view. What did you guys do the last time someone was dumb enough to invade Russia proper?

 4. What about the whole ""we're brother cultures"" approach? I mean, yeah, that might've maybe worked if you'd given it an honest go way back before 2014. But now that you've tried to blitzkrieg their capitol, seems to me that it's just maybe a *little bit late* for that. Tiny bit. Just a tad.

 5. On a side note, the other thing you have standing in your way there is the legacy of Soviet-era stuff like the Holodomor. As far as I know, you've never really honestly contended with that old bad history. And here's where that's gonna really cost you. (Now, is it fair that you have to deal with this given all the shit that *America's* pulled over the years? Nope! I have no doubt karma comes for us all in the end and we all pay for our sins in time. But today? *Today, it's your turn.*)

 6. Did some of the current situation come about as a result of US/NATO meddling? Who knows. But I don't think we'd be here if this wasn't what the Ukrainians really wanted. If we could just magic up fighting spirit and determination, don't you think we would've done that in Afghanistan?

 7. Speaking of which - take it from someone in a country that's recently learned the hard way - *again* - that you can't just remold things to your liking with military force alone: **just stop.** Stop hurting people. Stop making things worse for yourselves and others. At this point, it doesn't matter what you do. Your damaged pride is gonna remain damaged. The Ukrainians are gonna hate you for what you've done to them, maybe for a long time. All you're doing now is throwing lives away into a bad situation that - as far as I can see - only gets worse from here out for everyone, one way or another.

 8. And what about Putin? Well, let's face it. Putin needs to go. Everyone knows it. He's overcommitted himself to all of this. He fully owns this debacle and he knows it. He wouldn't be pushing mobilization otherwise. Now the only question is how many people he takes with him on the long spiral down.

 9. But he's ensconced himself in power and the secret police and military establishments still seem behind him. So... right now, it looks like you're gonna have to do this the hard way. (Though looking at Russian history, are you really that surprised? I mean, shit, what else is new, right?) I don't know how to do that. I'm not a brave person, and I don't like telling people to do what I myself would be afraid of doing. The best I can think of is to maybe take a look at [this](https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/467529962c184258d08f16daec83d5da) for ideas. It's old, but I figure some of the stuff there is timeless.

 10. But let's keep it simple. You're hurting and afraid right now. I see that. Just remember: get rid of Putin, and there's still a chance to turn all of this around. The sanctions can be removed. The conscripts can be pulled back. There's still time. There's still hope. Focus on that. End Putin, end the war. And maybe - just maybe - all of this goes away.

Here endeth the babble. Good luck, everyone. I honestly mean that. Fall's just begun. Suspect there's a long way yet to go before we're all out of the dark.",1664596106.0,1664593223.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Basically, it is about the situation where Russian south neighbours help those anti-war people who flee the country now, in opposite of European countries who just keep banning fleeing Russians. I just wanted to share a few thoughts.

First (as a Russian living in Canada), I want to express a huge gratitude to Georgia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Tajikistan (and Mongolia?) people for helping anti-war Russian refugees with basic needs. There are a lot of volunteers that help Russian refugees with housing and other needs. There are reports of locals in Kazahstan providing their cinema theatres as housing for refugees.

That is truly remarkable, considering how much inconvenience do the refugees cause - rent prices have grown significantly in those countries for example (because most of the refugees are highly educated and bring lots of cash). All this compassion despite my government (Putler) has committed crimes against you (like attacking Georgia). That is so kind, and if anybody reads it from those countries, I will never forget it (especially since my friend is now a refugee in Kazahstan and he only felt help and compassion from the locals).

Second thought is how Europe differs in this case. They decided to close the borders and refuse people who oppose the war.

And I don't even talk about compassion. I don't claim that Europe should think about fleeing Russians who lose almost everything including leaving their parents, jobs etc. What amuses me the most is that they don't care that one fleeing Russian that they could accept is minus one Russian who will be coscripted and will contribute to the destruction of Ukraine and their civil population.

I just don't get it. I would assume that Europe is the main player who would be interested to decrease the number of potential Russian conscripts.

Note: I recognize that this is a very controversial topic and I understand feelings of people who will downvote me as I partially agree with their arguments, but I just wanted to share my feelings. Thank you!",False,1664590223.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

I ask this because these formailities are important, those territories are not yet Russian according to the law, this gives Putin leeway to not escalate the situation further and react according to the battlefiend. If an annexed territory is too contested or seems about to be lost, then expect the controlled opposition to speak up and the ""debate"" to be dragged out in the Duma and Council and whatever steps are necessary for formal annexation. Then Putin can put the blame on politicians and say he did everything he could and it is not his fault the annexations didn't went through. This seems like a very logical thing to me.

Which is why it would be nice if someone here knew the dates for the Russian Legislature to vote on this and also the detailed legal procedure to be considered as part of the Russian Federation.

For the downvotes: I am not legitimizing the annexion or says that this makes it legit Russian land. I am stating that the legal formailities are an excuse for Putin and they can have real impact in the battlefield as they indicate how much Putin can be willing to throw to defend those lands, it is also a good way to measure how the military situation is going for Russia, if you start to see ""debates"" at the procedure then this indicates to us Russia could be preparing to withdraw.",1664579794.0,1664578672.0,t3_xrrpuq,t3_xrrpuq,,0,-8,0,-8,0,0,

Ukraine can't end the war; they are fully mobilized and using every piece of equipment they have, and while they have the momentum they are not getting Russia out any time soon.

Russia probably can't end the war;  they are recently mobilized, and the results of that have yet to be shown, but given their logistic and resource limitations, this probably won't be an overwhelming force.  Russia can't decisively end the war.

NATO could end the war.  NATO is choosing not to.  If you are NATO, you have two options in front of you:

1)  Send a tiny amount of affordable, excess or aging equipment, risk 0% of your human resources, and weaken your enemy.  The longer the conflict goes on, the weaker your enemy forces get, all while you suffer zero domestic risk.

2)  Get involved, dismantle and occupy the largest (geographic) nation on Earth, suffer 5-6 figures of domestic casualties in the process, multiply that by a few fold over the next decade of occupation and insurgency stamping-down, and destabilize the world while gaining no perceivable domestic advantage.

> Current and former American officials described the intelligence breach as one of the worst in decades. It set off a scramble in Washington’s intelligence and law enforcement agencies to contain the fallout, but investigators were bitterly divided over the cause. Some were convinced that a mole within the C.I.A. had betrayed the United States. Others believed that the Chinese had hacked the covert system the C.I.A. used to communicate with its foreign sources. Years later, that debate remains unresolved.

> But there was no disagreement about the damage. From the final weeks of 2010 through the end of 2012, according to former American officials, the Chinese killed at least a dozen of the C.I.A.’s sources.

The US and its allies invented the bomb, used it to save the cost of a horrific invasion, realized it was probably a bad idea (especially once another nation had them) and has since attempted to set up controls to help prevent their spread and use.

Other than that, there is very, very, very little reason for China to do anything than position itself as the ""voice of reason and peace"" and make vague, meaningless calls for peaces and diplomacy.

From a diplomatic and economic standpoint they would benefit from Russia weakening as they would fill the power vacuum with Central Asian states like Kazakhstan, who have already begun to pivot away from Russia and towards China.  Like India (who are being led with the same mindset at the moment) a weak Russia with no market for their energy means cheap energy for China (and India). However they don't want to fully turn against Russia because they need to be in a position to still partner with them should this all somehow end with Putin still in power.  So from their perspective, there is nothing to gain from taking a side, just lots of risk. China (and India) know that Russia will veto everything in the Security Council, so a vote against Russia does nothing but burn bridges with Putin.  Additionally, whether or not they come out diplomatically against Russia or not isn't going to have a material impact on the course of the war or Putin's fate, so again, all risk.

Henry further stated, “the way I am viewing what is going on in Ukraine now, is that the United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia.”  Henry and Gabrielian allegedly offered to provide the UC with private medical records from the United States Army and Medical Institution 1 in order to help the Russian government.  During the same meeting, Gabrielian demanded that if she were put at significant risk of arrest, she wanted her and Henry’s children to, “have a nice flight to Turkey to go on vacation because I don’t want to end in jail here with my kids being hostages over my head.”  Henry also indicated that he was concerned about passing a background check for his security clearance, telling the UC, “I don’t want to know your name . . . because I want plausible deniability too.

And there are reinforcements. ""Heroic"", as the PR man Ilya writes (TG-channel ""Older than Edda"") 20th army.

> The guys who fought on the Kharkov front, No need to explain about the ""heroic"". I personally did not come across, but volunteer friends who fought there described absolutely all interactions with the ""heroic"" as follows: - And then they promise us reinforcements from the ""twenty"".

> They come up... They look... And they leave.

> That's what I've been hearing about ""heroic"" for two months now. I would not write about it: the Russian soldiers of the twentieth army are, of course, heroes. 

> But here leadership raises questions. Many questions.

> Why am I writing? Because here is a fresh message from Fomich, the commander of the ""Russian Legion"", BARS-13, holding Drobyshevo.

> - The Armed Forces of Ukraine brought up additional forces and broke through the Front in the Drobyshevo-Stavka area.

> Perhaps it is worth posing the question in such a way as to change something in the command of the 20th Army? Well, or pull up some other reserves. Sorry. Liman is a pity, the ""Russian Legion"" is a pity, the command of the ""twenty"" is not very good.

While it’s true that russians in Kherson are trapped and under siege, there still is a lot of fighting, and it’s one of the hardest areas.

Russia’s most “elite” units are there, the sheer number of them is just huge.

The geography is not doing a favor for the attacking side, it’s a plain steppe without even enough “tree lines”.

Each UA attack unfortunately comes at a higher price compared to Kharkiv front.

And unfortunately, in this particular front, when we hear about a liberated town and then it doesn’t show up as liberated after even a week or two, it doesn’t always mean it was false or it’s because of fog of war, it often means that RU took it back, or UA had to retreat due to heavy artillery shelling.

I’m sure things will work out and the dynamic will change in this front too, and Ukraine will definitely take back Kherson, but it will be hard… until it won’t be as hard when RU supplies dry out.

And again, unfortunately I’ve seen more footage of destroyed UA equipment (including recently supplied western armored vehicles) on this front than on any other.

Fighting on this front implies a lot of (heavy) armored vehicles, more than anywhere else, due to geography.

In donetsk there’s infantry fighting, because trenches are just a couple dozen meters one from another.

In Kharkiv there’s light vehicles and fast attacks, because RU forces are weak there and are on low numbers.

In zaporizhie front there are mostly artillery duels because the geography is flat too, and both sides lack enough troops on that direction to initiate any attacks, they’re concentrated on other fronts.

In Kherson Ukraine has a strategic goal to liberate it, and RU wants to keep it as the only major city they control, they concentrated a lot of troops there.

Ru had digged in very seriously in this direction.

And since it’s a steppe with huge distances between positions, distance which is under mutual artillery range, the only way to gain something is by using artillery to destroy fortifications, and heavy armory to attack",False,1664529044.0,t3_xrrpuq,t1_iqh5zvg,,1,57,0,57,0,0,

You haven’t noticed the 30 years of brain drain? 

Tldr: It’s better to pack up and go to better lands. 

Ever heard of crab mentality? Ever read 1984? Ever imagined dying? 

Now you are a pissed brave Russian- everyone around you is ok with their situation and suffer peacefully. Scared. Hopeless. 

You will never reach critical mass in changing the situation. Run outside into a meat grinder for protesters or move to your fellow Russians in a foreign country. 

Let’s say you have kids to relying on you not to be sent to the gulags too. 

Don’t bullshit yourself and say Russian you would lead the revolution that will never happen because you know enough people would never join you in the street, the mafia would just fuck you and your entire family if you got a touch too big, and leave your family beyond fucked, murdered, or abandoned at best. 

No, you would suffer quietly like average Russians do or you would pack up and flee like the average Russian brain drain has done for three decades.

Putin has been making veiled nuclear threats, but will likely resort to more conventional - though equally brutal and destructive - carpet bombing of Ukranian cities with strategic bombers, in a desperate attempt to force a ceasefire and drive Ukraine to the negotiation table.

The fact that we've seen so many Russian aircraft shot down in the past weeks could indicate that Russia is actively probing Ukraine's air defenses. Even if faced with serious aircraft losses, they might bank on overwhelming the Ukrainian air defenses by going for massive simultaneous sorties on multiple urban targets beyond the front lines and deep into Ukraine (think Karkhiv, Kyiv, Odessa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, even Lviv). Towards the home front and any neutral countries around the world they will play it as a just conventional warfare tactics similar to the ones employed by the U.S. in many previous conflicts.

The wildcard is how NATO would react to such escalation and whether they might intervene in the defense of Ukrainian cities and civilians (possibly by establishing no-fly zones)  - without the blessing of the U.N.

- The Allies invested in unpopular wars for long periods of time from 2003. This time support remains high and is yielding actual results

- Support for different countries during the cold war didn't precipitate a world war, and the risk to the Allies at the time was much higher (a stronger enemy - USSR)

- A world war would need CCP involvement in some manner. In the event of escalated hostilities, it's more likely they'll non-align in the meantime. Despite hyperbole, they are not ready to go for all out war in Asia.

- If CCP did get involved, long term they are screwed, far too many of their resources are sourced overseas and the Allies have much better power-projection to shut down their supplies. Their industry would effectively be crippled, while many Allied nations would suffer, on the whole their industry will eventually survive.

- Allied nations would eventually be able to source most CCP-made items elsewhere, just at much greater cost.

Too much of the 'WW3' rhetoric relies on CCP, without it it's far more geopolitically like Vietnam or Afghanistan (80s) than WW2. CCP does not want a WW3, it wants a localised conflict it can win, which isn't really a thing at the moment.

It was especially important to Russia when Russia held Kupyansk by virtue of a major rail link direct from Russia, through Lyman, eastwards through Severondetsk to Russia's forces in Donbas.   Holding Lyman was vital to the flow of supplies to the Russian forces. 

When Russia lost Kupyansk and couldn't route rail traffic from Russia to Lyman, Lyman became less relevant as a logistical hub.  Instead,  Russian logistics now pivots through Svatove (watch for that name).

Nevertheless, Lyman remained a rail-supplied ""hard point"" in Russia's defensive line that they absolutely do not want to lose to Ukraine.  If Ukraine can take Lyman, it has the advantage of supplying *its* troops via the supply hub.   If you look at the geography, you will see that Ukraine is divided into a set of valleys with rivers at the bottom surrounded by hilltops.  These make very natural defensive lines.  

But Lyman sits at a junction of several ways across and into the interior.   If Ukraine  can take Lyman, they will essentially have a massive rail-supplied bridgehead over two natural obstacles.  It's a major foot in the door.

Therefore, Lyman is being fiercely defended, by Russian regular troops.  If (when) Ukraine liberates Lyman, Russia will lose a major defensive  position.  

Finally, Russia's defeat at Lyman is proof positive that Ukraine can defeat Russian forces:  prepared, well supplied, and dug in. It's not a ""reprioritization of missions"", it isn't a ""goodwill gesture"", it's not falling victim to a brilliant strategic feint, and it's not because of some incompetent general.

It’s about a combination of:

-	A EU-aligned, prosperous state with a sizable Russiaphone population is an existential INTERNAL SECURITY threat, because the Russian population would begin thinking “why can’t we?”
-	Ukraine is a microcosm of Russia’s potential. Black Sea cost, untapped hydrocarbon wealth, agriculture, and some impressive manufacturing base. A successful Ukraine could actually undercut Russian influence in those areas.  See also past Russian dependence on Ukrainian military and space components.  Ukraine represents an ECONOMIC threat. 
-	And finally, it’s about protecting Russian Black Sea access.  This has been the cause of MULTIPLE wars by Russia.  They are triggered as hell by the idea of Sevastopol or the Azov Sea being interdicted by a non-vassal state.

But Lend/Lease is more than that.  It's a statement.  The US is very proud of our role during WW2 as the arsenal of democracy against fascism.  By passing a Lend/Lease act the current political leaders are telling the world and the American public that we will step up as the arsenal of democracy once again.  That anywhere this new fascism appears, anywhere someone is willing to fight it, they will have access to the full industrial and technical might of the United States.

Lend/Lease isn't a big change to US law like it was in WW2 when it repealed the Neutrality Acts.  But it's a big statement.  And it also means that the Congress can't stop Biden from supporting the war, only the American people can, in 2024.",False,1664522738.0,t3_xrrpuq,t1_iqgxjuq,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative

Consider the Ground Based Midcourse Defense, our current solution to a small ICBM attack from NK or Iran. It cost about $40 billion to make, we have 70 ish interceptors, each one costs $75 million, and a single one has around a 57% change of success so four need to be fired for a 97% chance of success against a single missile with no decoys.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-Based_Midcourse_Defense

It seems like THAAD may have some potential in the future. Right now it is nominally used for medium range AA defense but with how the US deploys it and with future plans for the program, it seems like it has the highest potential as a cost effective interceptor if you read between the lines. Lockheed is trying to get a contract to build an extend range version for example, which came out in response to China's hypersonic glide vehicle test (which is space based).

This website has some good info. Personally I think the free world is capable of substantially reducing the threat of nuclear holocaust using technology, and should do so. I don't care about this like balance of power and such, I'd rather fight a conventional WW3 than have the specter of nuclear annihilation hung over our heads by autocracies.

Russia has no shortage of men power, equipping them is the real problem, so even if Europe takes every person that tries to flee, it wouldn't change the numbers that russians can assemble.

Also, people who are trying  to flee are probably would be less effective fighters and would surrender more easily, so in that sense, it's even better that Russia will draft them.

*At the conclusion of the conference, a tribute to Comrade Stalin was called for. Of course, everyone stood up (just as everyone had leaped to his feet during the conference at every mention of his name). ... For three minutes, four minutes, five minutes, the stormy applause, rising to an ovation, continued. But palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching. And the older people were panting from exhaustion. It was becoming insufferably silly even to those who really adored Stalin.*

*However, who would dare to be the first to stop? … After all, NKVD men were standing in the hall applauding and watching to see who would quit first! And in the obscure, small hall, unknown to the leader, the applause went on – six, seven, eight minutes! They were done for! Their goose was cooked! They couldn’t stop now till they collapsed with heart attacks! At the rear of the hall, which was crowded, they could of course cheat a bit, clap less frequently, less vigorously, not so eagerly – but up there with the presidium where everyone could see them?*

*The director of the local paper factory, an independent and strong-minded man, stood with the presidium. Aware of all the falsity and all the impossibility of the situation, he still kept on applauding! Nine minutes! Ten! In anguish he watched the secretary of the District Party Committee, but the latter dared not stop. Insanity! To the last man! With make-believe enthusiasm on their faces, looking at each other with faint hope, the district leaders were just going to go on and on applauding till they fell where they stood, till they were carried out of the hall on stretchers! And even then those who were left would not falter…*

*Then, after eleven minutes, the director of the paper factory assumed a businesslike expression and sat down in his seat. And, oh, a miracle took place! Where had the universal, uninhibited, indescribable enthusiasm gone? To a man, everyone else stopped dead and sat down. They had been saved!*

*The squirrel had been smart enough to jump off his revolving wheel. That, however, was how they discovered who the independent people were. And that was how they went about eliminating them. That same night the factory director was arrested. They easily pasted ten years on him on the pretext of something quite different. But after he had signed Form 206, the final document of the interrogation, his interrogator reminded him:*

If you look at Russia, China, and North Korea's military propaganda you'd think they're the most ferocious nations on earth.

Russian military training is exactly like this as well. They train for ""success,"" meaning that their battle drills and exercises are highly choreographed, recorded, and incentivized by commanders to show success.

As a US Army vet, I can say that the American military does the opposite. We train to failure. A ""highlight"" clip of an Army brigade at the National Training Center (NTC, in the Mojave Desert) would show the trainers pushing units to the brink of failure - deliberately sabotaging logistics, tanks running out of fuel, random ""missile drops"" that wipe out platoons, etc. NTC is designed so that the training unit always loses.

The difference is that when Russia for success, they naturally don't train for contingencies and redundancies in their plans. When the US trains to failure, it means that by the time they're done they have finally mastered 12 different ways to annihilate the Iraqi Army in weeks.

The fact that we've seen so many Russian aircraft shot down in the past weeks could indicate that Russia is actively probing Ukraine's air defenses. Even if faced with serious aircraft losses, they might bank on overwhelming the Ukrainian air defenses by going for massive simultaneous sorties on multiple urban targets beyond the front lines and deep into Ukraine (think Karkhiv, Kyiv, Odessa, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro). Towards the home front and any neutral countries around the world they will play it as a just conventional warfare tactics similar to the ones employed by the U.S. in many previous conflicts.

Deterrence is way more effective. You deter your opponent from even trying to use nukes by advertising your ability to shoot everything down.

They solved that issue a few years later and that Mikron fab can make anything in 65nm.).

> Recent research has consistently shown trends toward fewer and less lethal wars over time. This trend is most visible when looking at interstate conflict in the 20th century, which has decreased dramatically since the late 1940s. The story for intrastate conflict, such as rebellions and insurgencies, is more complicated: The number of such conflicts in the world today is higher than at the turn of the century, although not as high as it was during the Cold War. Despite the increased intrastate conflict over the same time period, the number of battlefield deaths per year has been trending downward over time (see left).

 >The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed by McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing). Following reviews of proposals, the United States Air Force selected McDonnell Douglas's design in 1969 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the Israeli Air Force.

They believe in the rule of force so long as they encounter limited international resistence (see South China Sea).

The thing we don't know is the limit of their escalation when resistance is met. They are watching Ukraine probably closer than most nations as a failure by the west will be analysed and possibly exploited in Taiwan when the time comes.

I think that ship has sailed to be honest, they played wolf-warrior at the wrong time, it basically woke up the world to what the CCP is really like, and how they see the rest of the world.

Russia invading Ukraine has galvanised the Allies and any force application in Taiwan just got a whole lot more difficult geopolitically.

 >On 30 September 2022, the Russian Federation annexed the partially occupied Ukrainian oblasts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Collectively, these four regions make up around 15% of Ukraine's territory. The annexation was formalized in Moscow at an official ceremony in the presence of Russian-installed heads of the four regions (Leonid Pasechnik, Denis Pushilin, Yevhen Balytskyi and Volodymyr Saldo) and Russian president Vladimir Putin. Ukraine, the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations all stated that the annexation ceremony has no legal value.

Most people don't like intentional bombings of civilians, nerve agent poisonings, and the constant threat of nuclear annihilation. There is already a stereotype of Russian culture being categorized by brutality and abuse; war crimes certainly add to that perception.

No one wants to deal with it anymore. So compassion is only extended to ""good Russians"" who demonstrate that they oppose Putin and the brutality associated with Russian culture.

Most people in the West haven't lived under a dictatorship like Putin's, so while it's easy to say ""rise up and overthrow him"" they don't understand just how hard it is to do so. How dangerous and how likely to end in failure, torture, and death. 

I think at the same time, if I'm being perfectly honest, they can't care anymore. And maybe they shouldn't be expected to. Because while it is true that dictators rule with an iron fist, it is also true that they can only rule if the people let them. In that sense, the people are always in some way responsible for their ruler. In America, Trump was a cancer that we allowed to be unleashed on the world, but he was our responsibility. Any ruler is ALWAYS outnumbered by his people and can be overthrown by them. Russian history itself is a testament to that. And I think that as sick as the West is of Putin's bullying, lies, casual disregard for human life, and nuclear threats.....deep down we are just as sick of the Russian people for allowing it to happen, many even actively enabling and supporting it. They let Putin terrorize the world for decades and now that it's affecting them personally, they're running to Europe to save themselves and Europe isn't having it.

We are looking at the Ukrainian military. You can’t isolate their performance to just now. You have to look at it within context. 

But let’s just forget that they went from 0 to 60 in no time. 

Ukraine has continuously been training new soldiers, getting them to where they need to be quickly, keeping them supplied, retaking massive amounts of territory with relatively low losses, have continuously taken out high ranking Russian officers, have continuously hit very important targets deep behind enemy lines, they’ve seized a staggering amount of equipment, and they’ve been decimating Russian forces at each turn. 

That’s not what experts expected prior to the invasion. Most experts assumed this would be an insurgency. That they would be restrained to fighting using guerrilla tactics while Russia occupied their country. 

That didn’t happen. Instead, Ukraine has been using the resources they’ve been given incredibly effectively and has forced Russia to completely change their tactics/goals.

When you have weapon systems with parts that have a lifespan of hours, you need an ongoing supply chain that reaches from the factory to the military bases at the front to keep the system running.

As for why have parts that only last hours? For the same reason race cars do. Because the equipment can work better, be pushed harder, if you do.

Take for example, regular car brake fluid. The stuff has some amazing specifications, most notably its extremely high temperature resistance. It's got one huge drawback though. Expose it to water, just the water in the air, and it breaks down. So the fluid in your brakes is only exposed to a tiny amount of air in the reservoir, but even that is oversized to keep the air away from the fluid in use in the tubes. Use it as transmission fluid, and it'll be amazing... For a few hours.

So cars don't use it outside of brakes. The military would see that and think, no problem! Just replace it every day, and we can get more power out of the engine!

I repeatedly stated my aswers were about IMMEDIATE membership.

IMMEDIATE membership is completely off the table as any avenue to any kind of membership would take a while to implement.

Ukraine is in a good position with NATO right now and this expedited application is mostly symbolic. NATO refusing the application (for now) will also just be theatrics to show Russia that they are not moving into Ukraine.

Ukraine is getting a whole lot of help from NATO countries, and NATO is not attacking Russia. Once the war nears it's end, the construction of the avenues for memberships will have progressed behind the scene. NATO membership might turn into the biggest bargaining chip for Ukraine.

There's a million ways for Ukraine to join or not join NATO in order to get security guarranties from Russia and full military backing from NATO. This can't be done IMMEDIATLY and NATO countries are already sending all the help they WANT to send Ukraine. They don't WANT to directly engage with Russia right now.

Let's speak hypothetically then: Let's say Russia does decide to nuke a few major cities in Ukraine, killing civilians en masse, and Zelensky decides to throw in the towel as a result.

""All war is inhuman. Here are some comparisons of the atomic bombing with conventional bombing.

At Nagasaki the fatal casualties were 45,000 and the area wrecked was considerably smaller than at Hiroshima because of the configuration of the city.
