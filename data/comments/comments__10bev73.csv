They are celebrating RIGHT now, that they killed innocent people in Dnipro as a result of their missile barrage.

I am once again stating that Western media absolutely does not paint this war correctly. They do not show absolute vile comments, gloating, hatred that Russians display towards Ukraine and Ukrainians. Only few channels do, but the rest is focused on “poor russians”.

If you want to learn what is ""real Russians"" think, just visit few ""neutral"" Russian forums, telegrams and see what they write with translator.

You can visit Pikabu, Telegram channels, Yaplakal, and many other places. Check forum themes where they declare victories, no matter how small.

And the story is ALLWAYS the same. Russians are gloating. They are happy. They are celebrating. They are threating that they will go ""forward"", and that they will ""return Kiev"" and all of Ukraine.

This is the main and absolute difference between Nazi Germany and Nazi Russia.

Germans had vague understanding of what happening for some time, because they chose to ignore it, and looked away.

Russians KNOW full well what is going on. They can watch it in real time. And they are celebrating it. They are proud of atrocities they committing. They want to commit more. They are proud that ""Russia is expanding"". They want to expand it more. They are proud they are genociding Ukrainians.

I hope in the future, all Ukrainian children will learn from these vile comments and we will save them full well to show every and each Ukrainian child what Russians truly are. We must never forget that Russians tried their best to destroy us, that they gloated, laughed, and celebrated genocide of Ukraine and annexation they were conducting. And we MUST never forget who our enemies are.

All these comments, all these reactions of bombings, of “taking” of our cities, they MUST be archived, they must be studied. We must never forget what Russians did to us, and how happy they were doing it. How they celebrated it, taunted us, gloated, and threatened to take Ukraine.

A third could be that significant progress has been made by Ukraine somewhere, most likely Kremmina and Svatove.

An observation: they're really laying it on thick this week.

So let's review.

The Russian media lies like the Russian state: continually and aggressively. No matter the pretense, they have no desire whatsoever to report the actual truth. They aren't allowed to, for one, but the bigger problem is that the Russia has been a shifting swampland of lies and corruption for so long that I don't think they even believe there is a truth to report. The truth is what people believe, and so information, all information, is just another weapon to get what you want.

So the race in on to make up the most extreme, preposterous ""truth"" they can come up with, to get eyes and attention to their broadcasts, and possibly good attention from the sanctified powers-that-be at the top of the pyramid. The capos, kleptos and warlords. The dispensers of all that is good — power, favors and money — in Russia,  because they've stolen it all.  

So if you pay attention to the Russian media you will most definitely be less informed after than before you started. If you end up  hearing something they've said despite this, it's better to assume from the get-go that everything you have heard is a lie of some sort and try and figure it out from there. Or ignore it completely, which is, really, better anyway.

The problem is that they call themselves reporters and they sometimes get considered, by outside sources, as a legitimate take on the news. But that too is a lie, because all this dispensing of favor makes it end up propaganda for the state wrapped up in what amounts to rage-porn entertainment. Which is of course a deeply disturbing idea in itself. Sorry about that, but it's fair. 

Another truly weird and new aspect of this war of information, with reporting used as weapons, is that the Russian doctrine has been taken over by the Spirit of Christmas Selfishness. The acting credo is: ""Who can I fuck over to get ahead?"" So we have all these opposing PMCs and factions, each with their own media pets trying to curry favor, creating their own lies with their own agendas. So nothing is coherent. Which actually serves back into the corrupt idea that there is no truth and truth is what we say it is. The Kremlin and the FSU surely approve. 

So in this confusing cloud of conflicting reports, I get why people say: ""The Russians said this monstrous thing! The Russian said they won that battle! The Russians said the Nazis they're fighting bite the heads off kittens!"" The Russians work to destroy truth and fog the information battlefield by blowing smoke out of their asses. It's *the plan*. So be aware of this and go elsewhere for your news, no matter how tempting it is to hear what the other side has to say for themselves. In most circumstances involving a disagreement it's good to listen to your opponents' point of view. But not when their doctrine explicitly says to use it as a weapon against you. Don't walk into the punch.

Some wanna send Leopard 1 first. And if Leopard 2 then from the industry, so the Bundeswehr can keep theirs. (Think people underestimate how many tanks Germany exported, especially to Spain for example, Saudi Arabia wanted like 600, more than Germany even) 

I guess the job to communicate military topics is the defense minister and current one is on the way out. So partially her fault too. 

In defense, Poland has election this year, and the ruling nationalist-conservative party is low in polls, they get rather populistic easily. But by now it should be clear that several countries would send tanks..Or maybe they know Germany will decline lol.

Second possibility - Russia got those Iranian missiles. They are simple, no dodging, but also smaller and different from Iskander-M. That would explain the report that Russia destroyed Tochka-U missile (which didn't make sense as it doesn't have a range).

Not purely a matter of nations belly-aching about how much it costs to protect Ukraine, but a matter of maximizing bang for the buck. Spending a million on a munition which might not reach its target instead of spending the same on something which Russia, to date, has no answer to.

Our Russian relatives told us that we are getting ""liberated"" first, and then blamed us for ""not giving up"" and called us nazies. There is countless examples of how Russians chose this war and supported invasion and actions, instead of their own family members. 

Russians are supporting this war in masse. They are enabling it. 

It is absolutely NOT ""edgy Russians teenagers"" and ""propagandists on state TV"".  Russia is a HUGE country. When you see so little resistance to the war, its a sign that these people are not proof that ""russians are generally against it"", or “they do not really want this war”. Its a sad sign that they are exception that proves the rule. 

When mobilization started in Russia, some thought they will ""wake up"". Instead they complained that they are ""badly trained and equipped to kill Ukrainians"". Inaction is a choice. Silence is a choice.

See this sort of argument is what I'm talking about, people hammer on about ""end it now"" because it is having a ripple effect globally either by supply chain disruption or governments spending money militarily etc. They believe that a big burst of throwing money&shiney guns at the problem will mitigate the impact in the long run because they think it will be over faster. What I'm saying is this isn't necessarily true cause it will prompt counter-actions from powers that don't want to see the US&friends being successful at playing world cop. Its like boiling a frog if you are impatient the frog will react and in the end you don't save any time and effort compared to slowly upping the heat on top of the extra wet mess you now have to clean up.

This isn't an argument against escalation mind you I agree that by the end of this Ukraine needs western military capabilities, and Russia and its loyal intermediaries needs to be economically isolated if not defanged and broken up, but I do not believe being rash and impatient will get you the results you are hoping for, so If you want to find an argument to rationalize escalating any faster than we already are then its gotta be better than ""it will be over faster"" cause it arguably will not.",False,1673721181.0,t3_10bev73,t1_j4c2fcv,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Making it illegal to talk about isn't going to stop people having opinions, and making it illegal to talk about it is going to be about as effective as making it illegal to do drugs.
