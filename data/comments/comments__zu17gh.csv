Day 304 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet day here in Kharkiv, we had no missile or drone strikes, just some uneventful air raid alerts. Sadly, the same can‚Äôt be said about some other cities, like Kupiansk, where come civilian housing was shelled, killing at least one person, and Kherson, which was shelled relentlessly today. 

Fucking Russian bastards shelled the center of Kherson on the Christmas eve while a lot of civilians were out on the streets. They killed at least 10 people and injured over 60 more, many of whom are in a serious condition. There were no military targets anywhere around, so civilians were their target as usual. Do they still think they can make us surrender by doing this? How fucking stupid can they be?

Immediately after that strike they also started spreading fakes, saying that it was our forces that shelled Kherson with HIMARS, and their ‚Äúevidence‚Äù was a photo of some GMLRS fragments from fucking 2017. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even understand that image search exists, they think they can say whatever they want and everybody will believe it. Well, sadly there are a lot of people that do believe them with no questions asked, which is just horrible, I don‚Äôt understand how some people can believe anything that Russia says.

There is also a very high chance of the next big missile strike happening tomorrow, probably already in a couple of hours from now if it does happen. There are a lot of reports from our military saying that there are currently 4 missile carriers with 24 missiles total in the Black Sea, which are ready to fire, and they are usually out in the sea right before every new big missile strike happens.

bb77b23580a5a7844ecb46247d384eb3,zu17gh,j1jjjkc,"Firstly, thanks for the post. You have illustrated the current situation perfectly.

What you are missing is the fact that Putin does not care about peace or suffering. Not one bit.

To understand what someone like Putin thinks, forget what he says. Words are a weapon for Putin. The same as missiles and troops. They are there to attack his enemies. Period. Any analysis of what he says quickly illustrates contradictions.

Putin‚Äôs actions show his intentions. 

Putin has been very good at leveraging his main advantages and it‚Äôs not Russia‚Äôs resources.

In fact it‚Äôs worth listing his four main advantages in order of importance:

1. Time. As a world leader, Putin has a huge advantage with regard to time. He can, and does, plan over decades. 

2. Absolute power. Unlike most world leaders he can get Russians to do anything. He is not encumbered by opposition.

3. A total lack of normal ethics regarding human dignity and the rule of law. Especially regarding the rights of other countries and people. In fact, ethics is just another weapon to Putin.

4. Russia‚Äôs natural resources and population.

There is lots and lots written about Putin‚Äôs intensions. Most analyses I‚Äôve read miss the mark because they don‚Äôt look over a long enough time frame and over a wide enough breadth of activities.

I‚Äôll say it again, to understand Putin you need to look at his ACTIONS with his advantages in mind (long time, absolute power, no ethics).

I give some examples of his actions:

The internet: Putin has turned cyber crime into an income stream. It has taken years to build, but ransomware and international scam operations are a firm income stream for Putin‚Äôs reigned now. When your grandma gets conned by a scam operation or your hospital gets its data stolen, there‚Äôs a very good chance this is being done by a large scale operation that either pays some form of protection money to Russia, or is based in Russia.

Democracy: over the last 25 years, Russias public purse has increasingly corrupted world politics on a huge scale. No one knows how much Russia pays politicians but it‚Äôs LOTS. This has taken a huge amount of time and patience. Trump getting elected and Brexit are examples of things that simply would not have happened if it wasn‚Äôt for large scale Russian interference.

Crime: Russia is a state sponsor of international drug trafficking, especially to Europe. This has been very successful for Putin for a long time.

Media: leveraging time and money, Russia has an undue influence on susceptible media companies all over the world. There is a reason Tucker Carlson remains on Fox, and it‚Äôs not because his views are legitimate.

War and diplomacy: Russia has been consistently using money and military to control countries. When they cannot be invaded like Georgia or Chechnya, then they can be taken by using proxy governments. Syria, Belarus, and until 2014 Ukraine.

Putin‚Äôs actions tell you what his thinks. 

He‚Äôs like a 14yo kid playing Hearts of Iron or Civilisation. There is no getting on with other countries. There is only trying to conquer them.

When you look it through this lens, Putin‚Äôs intensions are obvious.

He will keeping fighting. He will will try to influence opposition politicians. He will chew through the Russian population (because they are a resource like oil or gas to him). He will continue to spew words of hate, lies.

He will continue to leverage his advantages as hard as he can: time, power, a lack of ethics, and the resources of Russia.

Even now, Putin believes these advantages will still lead to him winning Ukraine.

After all, democracies are so easy to manipulate. Money is too easy to find. Russia has millions of men.

No you cannot.  The word ""genocide"" has meaning.  It is not a thing that you can do ""to an adult male population"".  

""The Men"" is not an ethnicity, race, religion, or a nation.  

It is possible to commit genocide without killing a single person.  Look up ""Indian boarding school"" for numerous examples.  The topic is quite relevant in parts of occupied Ukraine.  Some Russia educators were captured in Kharkiv recently.  The school teachers are civilian.  I have not heard of any school teachers killing Ukrainian school children (the Russian army has killed many children in territory they had not occupied yet).  The accusation is that the educators were attempting to make them learn to be Russians.  Kidnapping children and raising them is another genocide technique.  It is still genocide even if you treat them like your own.  

Sometimes kidnapping children is just kidnapping.  Kidnapping is still unethical whether or not it is done with genocidal intent. 

Commiting mass murder is unethical.  Men have a right to life and liberty too.  ""Killing The Men"" is quite unethical whether or not it is part of a ""genocide"".

According to the numbers of [Kiel Institute](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/?cookieLevel=not-set) from Nov. 20th, the US government had committed to send about 25 billion ‚Ç¨ in humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine. The EU 32 Billion, not including direct contributions of the members (for example additional 3.1 billion from Germany and 0.8 from France...).

The US and the EU has since committed to give more, but I couldn't find concrete numbers for that in a quick way.

So, its not as bad as it seems. The US can give much more military support from their big supplies, that EU countries just don't have. But financially, the EU and its members have nothing to be ashamed of regarding help.

The destruction of the Russian male population isn't being forced, it's being chosen, by a subset of that same population, sharing the same culture and values. It's genocide, but self-inflicted, which is the unusual part. It's a murder-suicide, with all of the psychological overtones that term conjures. Because I can't see the destruction stopping until it removes the cause, the mad-king driving the obsession. With every Russian he kills he becomes more committed to his folly.

Kobe had sex with someone who, he agrees, didn't consent to having sex with him. That made him a rapist.

Edit: for some reason I'm not able to post a reply to your comment below, so I'll put it in here:

Yes, I did consider the possibility. If Kobe had sex with someone he thought consented but who did not consent, then Kobe raped that person. Having sex with someone who doesn't consent to it makes a person a rapist, regardless of what was in their own mind.

I'm not saying that's all Kobe was. It doesn't seem like he had further issues with women and late in his career he seemed to really mature. I'm of the belief that acts don't wipe each other out - do all the good you want but if you rape one person, you're a rapist who did a lot of good. So I'm not on board with OP's opinion that that one really bad act means Kobe's death wasn't tragic. It was. 

I just think that it's important to keep clearly defining what rape **is** so we can fight it. Kobe's case happened when the societal definition was way less clear than it is now, so a lot of people remembered it as ""who knows what really happened"" when Kobe's statement makes it clear that, even if he thought she consented, he raped that girl. I'm not trying to change people's opinions of Kobe, I'm trying to update people's understanding of what constitutes rape. Apologize if it comes off preachy, but I'm not clever enough to do it more pithily.


As to the last but - a court wouldn't order someone to release a specific statement in sexual assault cases, but I wouldn't be surprised if that was a condition of the suit being dropped (so court related, but voluntary).
