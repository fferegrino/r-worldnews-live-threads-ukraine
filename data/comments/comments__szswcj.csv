Excerpt: 

> When I returned for dissertation research in 2012, the default language was still Russian. Whenever I told people that my Ukrainian was stronger than my Russian, though, most people switched to Ukrainian. This was especially so with young people, who had mostly been educated in Ukrainian after 1991 (before 1989, Ukrainian-language schools were quite rare in the city). They chatted and cursed in Russian, but when I asked if they spoke Ukrainian, their beautiful...... slightly formal Ukrainian would come out. ""Of course! We learned it in school! We are Ukrainian citizens, and no one speaks Ukrainian better than Kharkivites!"" And of course no one in Ukraine spoke more idiomatic, sarcastic, and hilarious Russian, either.
>

[...]

> A new war would prove quite different from past Russian offensives during the summer of 2014 and winter 2015. Those battles resulted in the Minsk I and II ceasefires, imposed on Ukraine at gunpoint, but the deals are widely acknowledged in Moscow to have been failures that did not achieve Russia’s political aims. Repeating such operations—limited wars to coerce Ukraine into a deal—would come at great economic cost in exchange for no tangible benefit. Ukraine’s armed forces have improved and expanded considerably since 2014. A smaller war confined to the Donbas would incur higher casualties today, without good prospects for achieving any political objectives. If Russia seeks a quick and decisive victory, it will therefore have to dramatically expand the scope of the conflict—and the types of forces employed.


> Russia has positioned more than 150,000 troops to surround Ukraine from Belarus in the north to Crimea in the south. Together with Russian-led forces in the Donbas, and auxiliaries including Rosgvardia, Russia’s national guard, this figure may exceed 190,000. These ground forces are supported by hundreds of tactical aircraft, forward-deployed attack helicopters and the Russian navy. This is not a force for a limited campaign, but one designed to pursue maximalist political aims. Russia will seek to surround and isolate Ukrainian forces in pockets of territory, forcing them to surrender, and attempt to impose regime change in Kyiv.


> The Russian disposition of forces suggests that its general staff intends to conduct two major pincer movements into Ukraine. The lesser of the two will advance from the north on the capital, Kyiv. The larger attack will seek to encircle Ukrainian forces near Donbas. Russian-led units there may serve as a pinning force, while the main Russian grouping would advance from the north-east by Kharkiv and from Crimea in the south. In this scenario, Moscow would try to prevent Ukrainian forces from being able to conduct an organised retreat to more defensible terrain west of the Dnieper river.


> This war would begin with air strikes, missile strikes and use of electronic warfare and cyber-attacks. Their goal would be to degrade, fragment and paralyse the Ukrainian armed forces along with its political leadership. This air campaign would be brief, followed by a combined arms ground offensive. Russia’s ground force is an artillery army with tanks and mechanised infantry. It emphasises decisive use of firepower. These formations would be backed by attack helicopters, tactical bombers and missile brigades. Those supporting elements would dramatically increase the effectiveness of Russian ground formations in combat.


> Although Ukraine’s armed forces have improved since the fighting of 2014-2015, so have Russia’s. The units surrounding Ukraine are largely staffed by contract soldiers—professional servicemen, rather than conscripts—with high levels of readiness, modernised equipment and officers bloodied in several conflicts, such as the war in Syria. Ukraine’s military is understaffed, poorly supplied, and inexperienced in manoeuvre warfare. Russian forces therefore have considerable quantitative and qualitative superiority.


> Much is contingent in war, but Ukraine’s odds are grim in a conventional fight, even with Western-supplied weapons. Its forces might convert into partisan warfare, or take to the cities. The latter would prove a difficult decision as urban warfare is immensely destructive. Moscow probably hopes to organise local security forces, or to co-opt political elites, to avoid being dragged into urban combat. The current Russian force may be enough to occupy Ukraine’s eastern regions and the capital, but if Russian leaders believe they can control large parts of the country, they are likely to be walking into a sustained insurgency.


> Although Moscow has the military advantage, Russian pronouncements on Ukraine suggest that the Kremlin suffers from a high degree of war optimism—a common mistake made by aggressors throughout history. These conflicts tend to drag on well beyond the initial campaign, or escalate into regional wars. America’s experience in Iraq was hardly an aberration. Using force is always a gamble.

> This is the issue. If Ukraine's military tries to fight a conventional war with Russia, it will be defeated. An unconventional fight means moving into cities, which will lead to greater civilian casualties. All urban warfare is destructive and Russia lacks large PGM stockpiles.

> If Russia tries to conduct regime change, it will likely try to install someone who would reach out to elites in other cities. But if Russian forces go into cities, a lot of civilians could die. That would only increase resistance and make conflict termination more difficult.

> The big question is whether Russia can translate the use of military force into achieving its political goals and what will it do if it can't? A Russian invasion now would be an attempt to achieve what 2014-2015 failed to do, so more force is likely and compromise is less likely.

As we discussed back in October, Russia and India at the time had formally announced that India would be raising its coking coal imports from Russia to 40 million tons per year. Previously, India had been purchasing around 8 million tons of coal (all types) from Russia per year. While it is still unclear how soon imports will reach the 40 million ton level, of note this week is that Russia's Ministry of Energy has announced it has agreed on a deal to increase its coal exports to China to 100 million tons within three to five years. Last year, China purchased 57 million tons of coal from Russia. The majority of Russian coal exports to China are shipped with dry bulk vessels. The fact that Russia and China have announced such a deal at the very same time that tensions are intensifying between Russia and Ukraine is significant to us. While we continue to believe that any military action will result primarily in commodity prices and shipping prices receiving support, it is noteworthy that China is strengthening its relationship with Russia while many other nations are condemning Russia. Also of note is that China's state media editor this week has even gone as far as to say that Beijing must back Russia over Ukraine so it gets support when China fights for Taiwan. In both Ukraine and Russia, the conflict has still not significantly affected dry bulk exports and we continue to believe that it is very unlikely that any dry bulk trade volumes will experience significant losses over time. According to Ukraine's Ministry of Infrastructure, the number of vessels sailing to Ukrainian ports last week was also up on a year-on-year basis and they have been witnessing ""an absolutely normal situation in shipping"". Other than a few dry bulk vessels being forced to sail from Ukraine with partial loads of iron ore due to draft limitations (that have come from minor changes in shipping zones), dry bulk trade flow is not being significantly affected.

](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-crushing-loss-of-hope-in-ukraine)


Putin expects to succeed because he can overwhelm Ukraine with military force, and because he has known the threat of force to be effective against unarmed opposition. Putin’s main opponent, Alexey Navalny, is in prison; the leaders of his movement are all either behind bars or in exile. The number of independent journalists in Russia has dwindled to a handful, and many of them, too, are working from exile, addressing tiny audiences, because the state blocks access to many of their Web sites and has branded others “foreign agents.” Putin’s sabre-rattling against Ukraine has drawn little protest—less even than the annexation of Crimea did eight years ago. On Sunday, six people were detained for staging a protest in Pushkin Square, in central Moscow. One of them held a poster that said “Hands Off Ukraine.” Another was an eighty-year-old former Soviet dissident.

What Putin does not imagine is the kind and scale of resistance that he would actually encounter in Ukraine. These are the people who stood to the death in Independence Square. In 2014, they took up arms to defend Ukraine against a Russian incursion. Underequipped and underprepared, these volunteers joined the war effort from all walks of life. Others organized in monumental numbers to collect equipment and supplies to support the fighters and those suffering from the occupation of the east, in an effort that lasted for several years. When Putin encounters Ukrainian resistance, he will respond the only way he knows: with devastating force. The loss of life will be staggering. Watching it will make it impossible to live and to breathe.",False,1645659216.0,t3_szswcj,t3_szswcj,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

So they can't know precisely when the invasion will take place. 

What they do know is that they received intelligence to suggest something to the effect of  ""In feb, attack will happen"". From there, the only information they can go on is what their satellite imagery is showing, and comparing that imagery to already know information about how the Russian military act (as well as juicy intel from sources we won't ever know about, because we are simpletons from the general population). For example, if you see a bunch of vehicles all neatly parked in a grid formation at a base, near the border, you can surmise that an attack may happen soon. If you then see those vehicles line up one after the other on the road pointing towards the border, you can then surmise ""attack definitely happening very soon"".

1. Ukraine cannot join NATO as long as it has unresolved territorial issues (Crimea, Luhansk, Donetsk).
2. Russia wants to avoid Ukraine joining NATO and to either annex Donetsk and Luhansk or have them as independent forever disputed buffer states.

Ukraine can realistically:

1. Forsake all claims to Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk forever and join NATO thus giving Putin a partial win and a partial loss with the possibility of escalating the situation massively IF Russia invades Ukraine proper and NATO gets involved.
2. Keep the new status quo: Russia is forever sanctioned. But IF Russian troops enter Ukraine proper, Ukraine will be on its own. This can be a big gamble as Putin could end up conquering all of Ukraine and/or launching gradual invasions each time slowly chunking away more territory.

Either way, both Ukraine and Russia have a lot to lose in terms of economy and human lives while other countries (and the world in general) not so much unless a full WW3 breaks out if Uktraine joins NATO and Putin idiotically still invades.

'I'll try to take a slightly different approach to comments below: there is a slim to nil chance that in the next several years this is going to escalate to a WW3. An even slimmer chance that it will go nuclear. There is also a slim to nil chance that anybody's lives will be disrupted as a result of this, except if you live in Ukraine, or find it difficult to pay for gas/electricity.

You have a valid right to be concerned on behalf of the Ukrainian people. But do not be concerned for your own safety if you do not live in Ukraine. Likewise, do not be concerned that this will disrupt any of your plans in the short-to-mid-term. Even if they involve travel to Europe in the next month or so. You have very little to be worried about.

People saying shit like 'make sure to breathe and stay hydrated' are making out like this is something that poses an immediate and direct threat to their lives and that should be obsessively followed.

My suggestion is that if following this is going beyond curiousity for you and veering into obsession, stick your head in the sand for a while. You will notice nothing different apart from your wallet taking a hit. Then come back in a better headspace. The answer is not breathing, staying hydrated and getting some vitamin D. It's getting off this thread because this thread is a massive WW3 LARP by anxious people.

For the inevitable comments forthcoming:

* yes, anything could happen, and things can always spiral but a meteorite could also hit us tomorrow; doesn't mean we live in fear of it, and it doesn't mean that it's a likelihood.

* yes, there are some parallels to pre-WW2, but the context here is overall incredibly different.'",False,1645655945.0,t3_szswcj,t3_szswcj,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

The dominating belief is that we can and have to defend ourselves, and we can only trust ourselves with the defence of our nation, and that everyone else will only stabb us in the back in the end. I believe it's because of trauma from WW2, because the prevailing belief in Finland in 1940 was that we believed we had no other option but to choose between supporting Germany and supporting the USSR, resulting in over 200 000 german troops being stationed in Lapland, and eventually burning and destroying the entirety of Northern Finland, killing thousands of civilians. So basically joining NATO and allowing foreing troops on our soil with the goal of helping Finland defend against an invasion for the first time since 1944 seems to be a realistic option for us only when the only other option is having Russian troops on our soil. I believe the invasion of Ukraine will be viewed as the last straw by many, and public opinion will finally shift here in favour of NATO. and make no mistake, if Finland joins NATO so will Sweden.",False,1645657099.0,t3_szswcj,t3_szswcj,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

Initially they'll likely get removed from their houses and put into refugee camps on the russian side of the line. Inside of there will have Russian propaganda to justify the reasons for the war and explain why they're the good guys.

Some of the citizens will be asked questions regarding military movement and anything they may need to know. They may be told that if they're determined to be withholding any information they will likely be viewed as enemy combatants and face some sort of prison time. 

To the Russians, they will be viewing the Ukrainian citizens as their own citizens. If they were to succeed in annexing Ukraine and withstanding potential NATO counter attacks; Former Ukrainian citizens will be eventually given a 'grace period' to adjust. I imagine they will be in some way scattered from their former neighbors as to instead be surrounded by Russian citizens to influence their stance on the matter. They will be pushed to believe they were instead Liberated from their Ukrainian leaders.

Samoilenko grew up in Antratsyt, which is now part of the Russian-occupied east. On January 22nd, she wrote a Facebook post debunking the very idea that one can prepare for war. “When my town was occupied, the banks were the first to get plundered,” she wrote. “Then medications vanished from the drug stores. . . . Then the doctors left. . . . Many people stayed in town then. My mother’s colleague stayed and was killed in her own apartment; they tortured her for a long time, trying to find out where she hid her retirement payments. . . . Some people were killed on the highway. Someone was killed for his car. Many people faced demands for ransom for their family members. The former mayor was tortured and died. Hundreds of people vanished. Their go bags, their laminated documents, and their survival kits did not protect them.”

How the US will protect Taiwan wasn't made clear but for this reason, an invasion of China is less than what's going on now in Ukraine in my opinion. 

The chances of WW3 is slim because no one wants that. Three things will happen.

1. Ukraine is invaded and Russia is imposed heavy sanctions.

2. Europe unites and helps Ukraine fight back beating the Russians (not likely)

3. If number two happens, then Russia has a high chance of using a counter attack with the possibility of nuclear. This is why number two and three is highly unlikely because no one wants a world war. Either way, this isn't the USSR. Russia does not have the money for a war. Their gdp is about the same as Texas.

My guess is that Russia will instead try to slowly push Ukrainian's West and take the East for themselves (ideally with as little fighting as possible). But we'll see. If Ukraine decides enough is enough then it depends on how far they'll go to defend their territory.

> In comparison to China’s reaction at this point during the Crimea crisis, a consistent pattern is evident. As a theme, China has called for all parties to exercise restraint, prevent escalation, and resolve differences through negotiation. In the cases of both Eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Beijing has emphasized the complex historical factors and realities, a move that appears to place the responsibilities on both sides. If Crimea serves as a precedent, China will remain silent on the issues of sovereignty and territorial integrity, which in reality translates into a tacit recognition of the altered status quo without publicly stating so.

> There are several nuanced differences in China’s position this time around, however. The first is the Foreign Ministry’s statement that all countries’ reasonable security concerns deserve to be respected. In line with China’s balancing act, such a statement applies to Ukraine’s security concern with a Russian invasion, as well as Russian security concerns over the expansion of NATO. Wang Yi had publicly stated that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be protected—Ukraine included. That is widely regarded as the most clearcut position China has delivered on a Russian invasion during this crisis. However, Wang Yi’s statement should be assessed together with the qualifier that he added: that the result in Ukraine today is the consequence of the failure to implement the Minsk II Agreement. But that failure itself is the “Minsk Conundrum,” for which China views both parties as responsible. Last but not least, China claims that it will decide its position according to the merits of the matter itself, a clear move to refute speculations that China will side with Russia based on the joint statement Putin and Xi issued earlier this month in Beijing about Sino-Russia relations having “no limit.”

Its likely that the majority of troops are in that region anyway, since like I said - Belarus, Finland, Baltics will not attack. Nor Kazakhstan. Nor Mongolia.

2. You don't nuke something you want to capture, there is no benefit to it. Kiev is also pretty close to Russia and especially Belarus, they'd hurt themselves with the fallout. Kiev is also a city many Russians consider to be a historic capital of Russia, they'd probably much rather capture it back than remove it from existance.
3. They can win without using a nuke. In fact using one would likely give suicidal resolve to surviving Ukrainians. Also removes any chance of collaboration by pro-Russian Ukrainians.

That's how segregationist groups operate so freely in those areas and lay claim to Donetsk and Luhansk regions. That's why it was so easy for Putin to sign them away as independent, too. So Putin allied with longtime enemies of Ukraine military. Really, in a different world, the region could've separated democratically and ensured diplomacy and deescalation but that's not how it went unfortunately. Same with Crimea. 

The issue next is that they asked for Russia's direct help and Russia has made strong implications that they will fulfill that wish. So Russia is likely about to directly attack Ukraine. So they're basically using these segregationist groups to help them justify the conquering of the entire Ukraine.

NATO has to establish the precedent that not every country on earth gets free defense. NATO contributions are already thin and intervention would be costly for all members. Ideally every country on earth would be paying NATO dues but you have to draw the line somewhere. 

Ukraine does not deserve this obviously but they are a very flawed oligarchy with minimal democracy where political rivals are put in prison. They are by far the lesser evil here but it’s not like if Russia rolled up on France — Ukraine did not join NATO at least partly because membership requires a commitment to fair treatment of citizens etc

Again I truly wish this was not happening. It’s a tragedy.

Your probably right on point 1, and a little on point 2, but China is interested in money and becoming a super power, and the system as it currently exists is working pretty well on that front. Russian starting a war is going to rebalance the global order, hostility and suspicion between countries, less willingness to engage in global trade, not to mention China isn't going to want the reputation of being Russia's buddy after Russia becomes even more of an international outcast. China is borderline an evil authoritarian regime, but they're not dumb and not interested in starting large scale wars over some national pride ego stroking bullshit.

Russian forces have prepared a mobile crematorium for use in any future conflict with Ukraine in what Britain’s Defence Secretary has described as “chilling”.

The MoD released footage of a vehicle-mounted crematorium with room to “evaporate” one human body at a time, which has been seen trailing Russian forces and is expected to follow any troops into Ukraine.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, suggested the use of such a system may be a way for the Kremlin to cover up any future combat losses, fearing a repeat of the criticism at home when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.

Mr Wallace said if Russian forces instigate conflict in Ukraine “we expect to see some of the things they've done previously”.

“Previously they've deployed mobile crematoriums to follow troops around the battlefield, which in anyone's book is chilling.

""If I was a soldier and knew that my generals had so little faith in me that they followed me around the battlefield with a mobile crematorium, or I was the mother or father of a son, potentially deployed into a combat zone, and my government thought that the way to cover up loss was mobile crematorium, I'd be deeply, deeply worried.

""It’s a very chilling side effect of how the Russians view their forces and for those of you who served, and being a soldier, knowing that trundling behind you is a way to evaporate you if you are killed in battle probably says everything you need to know about the Russian regime.""

In the footage released by the MoD, Cyrillic text overlaid on the video says the equipment, which was created specifically for the destruction of hazardous biological waste, comes from a St Petersburg company called Tourmaline. The company’s website says it is ‘The Russian Incinerator Company’.

Attempts by The Telegraph to contact the company went unanswered.
Kremlin cover-up

At the time local and international media outlets, human rights groups and local activists reported Russian soldiers were being buried in unmarked graves in a bid to hide the fact they were operating inside Ukraine.

lol you are a pessimist

its completely plausible that the ruskies don't go for it. Up until the moment a decision is made, they have to prepare for war. The fact that they are observed preparing only confirms that a decision to deescalate has not been made. It does not confirm that one to invade has been made.

The original statement is that trump is openly praising putin.

Your argument is an oversimplified rebuttal: if trump is such a fan, how come putin didn't invade while he was president. This argument is completely ignoring that trump is *openly praising* putin's actions.

Then, you're doubling down on fallacies by using a post hoc argument, which is described as follows 

> if B happened after A, then surely A caused B

So your argument is that since putin attacked Crimea and launched an assault on ukraine when Obama and Biden were presidents, they are therefore a cause. That argument is absolutely bonkers because it ignores literally every other factor involved in this invasion.

Hope you learned something new and try to use proper logic and arguments next time you try and debate someone.",1645665449.0,1645665149.0,t3_szswcj,t1_hy6dzb4,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

It’s sad that so many people try to downplay their lack of understanding by claiming the other party is not  being descriptive enough in their explanations by pointing out their own inability to understand. The intelligent person would not need to qualify their statements with an obtuse unprovable fact such as “…I am smarter than most people on Reddit.”

Ignorance on a subject or in the context of a conversation is not bad, It is an opportunity for learning when one is humble enough to accept their own lack of knowledge and allow themselves to learn or listen to others, egoless. Whether simply not understanding what one is trying to say or not grasping the concepts surrounding the conversation, looking at one’s self as the source of misunderstanding will allow you the ability to self assess one’s knowledge and ego and better formulate their follow-up questions.
