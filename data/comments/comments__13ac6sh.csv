Day 436-438 of my updates from Kharkiv.

In the last couple of days Russians have been very active, they did at least 2 missile strikes (only counting the missiles launched from planes) and sent a ton of Shaheds at many of our cities. The attacks are still continuing even right now, though thankfully they haven’t been targeting Kharkiv much, so for us these days were mostly quiet despite those large-scale attacks.

There were no missile launches from Belgorod, but they still shelled many towns in Kharkiv oblast that are near the frontline/border. They launched quite a lot of missiles from their strategic aircraft in the last 2 days, and sadly they did manage to hit some of their targets, but as usual they target civilian infrastructure. A warehouse of some food company and some recreational facilities were hit in Odesa about an hour ago, the photos are already out and there are no military targets to be seen anywhere on them.

They also sent some Shaheds to Kyiv, by the looks of it most of them were intercepted but the debris fell in the city and injured at least 4 civilians and damaged a couple of buildings. At least one of the drones was most likely targeting an airfield, it was reported that it damaged the runway, possibly because it was intercepted before reaching its target, though it could have also been targeting our planes. The air raid alerts are still ongoing, one Shahed was intercepted in Kharkiv oblast recently, and they are also targeting Zaporizhzhia with missiles, so we can still expect more attacks to happen this night.",False,1683506260.0,t3_13ac6sh,t3_13ac6sh,,0,128,0,128,0,0,

By @KpsZSU ✊

russian propaganda attempts to impose the narrative that russian weapons are the best in the world and one-of-a-kind (""no analogues""). 
That‘s a big mistake. 

The Patriot system, a new powerful tool of Ukrainian air defense, shot down a Kh-47 hypersonic aeroballistic missile launched by russian war criminals at our country. 

Previously, we had no way of destroying such targets, but with the support of our friends the impossible becomes possible!

Deputy Minister of Defense Volodymyr Gavrylov stated this, The Independent reports . 
independent.co.uk/news/world/eur…

He deliberately did not reveal the timing of the counteroffensive, which is expected in the near future, when the spring rains will be replaced by more favorable weather conditions

""The success of Ukraine in its long-awaited counter-offensive against Russia could mean the complete collapse of the Russian Armed Forces or even the Russian economy. This will happen very soon. The offensive will reveal the truth about the tightly controlled Russian propaganda for military action and lead to a retribution among ordinary Russians.

We will launch our counter-offensive and , when that happens Russia will be panicked. You will see a lot of panic. They still don't understand that their propaganda is showing a false picture of what is really happening on the ground. This war will be won on the ground, not on TV screens, not on the internet "", Gavrilov said.

According to him, Russia lost 200,000 people during the war in Ukraine, but the Kremlin hid the true scale of Russian losses from its people. And when Ukraine begins to regain territory, and these losses will increase even more.

""You can't deceive your people for many years... especially if they start to see the difference on the ground, they start to see the killed and wounded, they see the families who lost their men. You can't hide the death of your son, your husband or your brother. Moscow will suffer from the consequences of this,""

Gavrilov added.

He noted that holding the malt-mining town of Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast played a key role in preparing Ukraine for a counteroffensive, allowing defense forces to dictate terms on the front line and depleting Russia's main military resources.

""The situation there has left the morale among Russian officers at a very low level. By keeping the bridgehead at the Bakhmut fortress, Ukraine has demonstrated the fact that the Russian military machine is not of the quality we saw a year ago when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and brought tanks into the first wave. This means that they will inevitably end in disaster sooner or later,"" said the deputy minister.

According to him, Bakhmut demonstrated not only to Ukraine, but also to the enemy that there is no military solution for Russia in this war. Ukraine's Western allies and commercial arms companies were reluctant to supply the country in the early stages of the war without a full upfront payment, believing that Ukraine would not last long enough to make the payments.

""We have demonstrated to others our courage, that we are reliable, serious and ready to defend our country by all means. We need something more sophisticated than ground-based air defense, capable of long-range strikes, to shoot down Russian aircraft at a distance of more than 100 km - simply to protect our people. 

That is why we are asking our partners to provide modern fighter jets such as F16 or similar and we insist that they be sent to us as soon as possible, because it is about saving the lives of civilians. for technological advantage and advantage,"" Gavrilov added

He suggested that 2023 could be the year of Victory.

As reported by OBOZREVATEL, on May 6 , Zaluzhny held a conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, Mark Milley. Ukrainian and American generals discussed the situation at the front and the progress of preparations for the de-occupation of Ukrainian territory.

*C N N:*

The US has high confidence in the accuracy of Ukraine’s claim that it used an American-made Patriot air defense system to intercept a Russian hypersonic missile, according to a source familiar with the matter.  

While the Patriot system has been successful in countering ballistic missiles, its ability to stop air-launched hypersonic missiles was purely theoretical before last week. Ukraine’s intercept has now provided a real-world demonstration of that capability — something that has been viewed within the Pentagon as a major development, the source said. 

Ukraine’s intercept claim created buzz within the Pentagon late last week, the source added, noting it is significant for several reasons.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly touted the capabilities of Russia’s hypersonic weapons and cast them as capable of overcoming all existing air defense systems. 

Production of hypersonic ballistic missiles has always been challenging for Russia and sanctions have only made it more difficult. 

But prior to last week, Russia’s calculus was that if it did use a hypersonic ballistic missile, whatever it was shooting at would assuredly get hit, the source said. This intercept has called that calculation into question, they continued.

The fact that this intercept was conducted by a Ukrainian crew that was trained in Oklahoma, but had no US advisers on the battlefield, is even more of a feather in the cap for the Pentagon, the source added, calling it a major return on investment. 

The intercept also has likely caused a severe amount of uncertainty for Russia, raising the question of whether Ukraine is in possession of a sustainable countermeasure against hypersonic ballistic missiles, the source added.",False,1683496890.0,t3_13ac6sh,t3_13ac6sh,,0,63,0,63,0,0,

Translation:

Regular readers and listeners should remember the assessment of the situation that I laid out (and expressed) last winter. One of the theses was: ""If the necessary national measures for the successful conduct of the war are not taken before May, we will not be able to win this war.

I state: NO MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN. Neither organizational nor personnel. The goals of the war have not been determined, and the inhabitants of the Planet of the Pink Ponies(PRP) have not understood that ""this war will be fought until one side is victorious. Accordingly, since there is no goal, there is no strategy. No strategy - no conscious work on its implementation. But the enemy has a strategy from the beginning and is being implemented with all its might. More and more successfully since the Kremlin is ""playing giveaway"" with an inexplicable enthusiasm and childlike confidence in the ultimate ""contract"" that is comfortable for the elderly Ponies, Elephants, and Unicorns.

Now we have to think about how to preserve the state, the country and the people in a situation of impending military defeat.

And, yes - even for a ""worthy non-fatal defeat"" (in which our enemies will be forced to abandon their plans for the complete fragmentation of Russia and the elimination of its sovereignty) we will have to fight long and hard. Harder and longer than it would have been if we had fought to win decisively from the outset. And the longer the occupants of the PRP will linger in the ""sweet languor"" of confidence in their peaceful and happy old age (which has long come for most of the VIPs) - the less chance that in the end the Russian ship will manage to get out of the military storm and systemic crisis, without sinking (after a long and bloody Troubles) into History.

Nobody asked, but here is my view of what is happening and it involves several elements.

What is happening is Wagner is likely being redeployed to areas the Russians think the counter offensive will happen. Wagner is the more effective Russian troops so this is likely.

 All these statements are probably made to make it sound like Russia has fewer weapons and manpower than they do. This is as an info operation to Ukraine and the west as you would want your opponent to underestimate capabilities. Certainly you are not seeing the tempo of attacks in Bahkmut slowing as one would expect if it was true. Now it is a pretty poorly done info op, but that is what it appears to be. I don't think Ukraine will fall for it and the west has the intel on what is really happening. 

Don't forget this big one too. Putin's efforts to deflect blame from himself is have all those under him get maligned when they fail. Keeps Putin above it to the Russian public. You will note Piggy is not criticizing Putin, but the MoD and Shoigu etc. They will be the fall guys if they don't take Bahkmut. So in the info op to the Russian public is ""this is not Putin's fault"".  This  happens a lot and is why you see commanders who did poorly, get removed from their position, then 6 months later are back in command. Blame was assigned, they were temporarily replaced, after it blows over they have been put back in command in some cases. The Russian leader taking the blame are well aware that they are doing this but have no choice but to go along.

It is notable the Russian trolls are not pushing back on this, if anything they are amplifying Pig-ozhin's message, it is absolutely everywhere on Reddit. That is not a sign of this being real, that is a sign this is an info op, the purposes of which could be the above.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,13ac6sh,jj8xwbt,"Two days ago, the Russian-international-academic-military channel Volya Media reported—shortly after Prigozhin posted his rant video—that it was just a show and was for the purpose of roping Wagner into the military more officially.

In a post titled, *A NonExistent Scandal*, they wrote first that the video was meant for the telegram-military audience.  To bolster acceptance of Wagner... [like, of supplies being given to Wagner]. 

They also wrote that the recently “fired” Deputy Defense Minister was not actually fired, just transferred—that his new division is the GRU, and that he is now on its payroll, in its office.  That in order to rope Wagner more in to the MOD, it’s needs to be under the umbrella of a division.  That it has so far been under the GRU division, but primarily as budget.  It needs to be under its command structure.  The “fired” general is going to be the liaison.  That already, Wagner ops are planned by GRU Officers.... But this higher profile person helps integrate Wagner, shields them from criticism of the domestic audience, as well as various MOD brass.  That supplies and casualties were no different than previously.  But that it was mostly about opening door to Wagner being under the GRU.

> The appearance of Mizintsev as deputy commander of Wagner does not speak to a fall from grace of the colonel general, nor does it speak to the growth of Prigozhin’s influence—but rather, that the PMC will soon be more integrated into the army structure. It’s for this reason, Mizintsev came—in order to concentrate not only military [plans], but also administrative and economic management. According to sources in the [RF] Ministry of Defense, there is no conflict between Mizintsev and Shoigu. 


https://t\.me/volyamedia/638

Regarding the insults, they write that they think that the tension and animosity is embellished—and that that part was for an international audience.  They speculate that Russia may actually want to create an illusion of disunity among elites or military brass, in order to intentionally create ... basically fake defectors or double agents, fooling western intelligence/military who will accept these Russians, but who actually still work for Russia.  [Lol—that’s a stretch! But this *did* happen during soviet days...]  

Well, that channel, as well as *Unian*, previously wrote about the good relationship of Surovikin and Prigozhin. 

Then I see today on Novosti.dn.ua that Prigozhin says Surovikin will now work with Wagner too?  Help plan their movements?

Eventually the flight hours on Russia's air force will built up and the already strained maintenance will cause their percentage of operational air craft to plummet, and the attrition on Russia's AFV stockpile will get to the point that Russia might not be able to even field tanks in numbers.

With such a wide front, and needed to deny both the Kherson river Bank, the entire land bridge, as will as the kremmena-svatova corridor, eastern and Central Bahkmut, and Donesk city itself, it would be easy for Ukraine to continue whittling away at Russian manpower and equipment by using probing attacks to threaten a stronger push all along the front to force the enemy to keep as much as possible within range of Ukrainian weapons.

Hell, basic math says that if Ukraine can field 1000 sniper teams, 1000 mortar crews, 1000 artillery batteries,1000 small tactical drone units, and 1000 ranger squads and between all these various elements kills just 500-1000 Russians in a day, Russia would have losses that cancel out their bi-annual conscription.

There has been a stir in recent days in terms of the internal Russian political factions as Prigozhin has announced a widely shared 'withdrawal' from Bakhmut. I doubt he will follow through, but the fact that he is escalating the dispute at all in this way is a symptom of the troubles between Wagner and the Kremlin on the whole. My friend in Kyiv thinks he is trying to replace Shoigu and Gerasimov. I am not so sure. If I were Prigozhin, I would want to stay as far away from Putin as possible, not get closer to him. But perhaps she is right.  
  
In a rhyme from last year's Severodonetsk-Lysychansk offensive, the Russians appear to be running out of steam in Bakhmut in general. There is one road left under control of the Ukrainian Army, the ""Road of Life"", and so far all Russian attempts to cut it have been unsuccessful. Vicious fighting in close quarters can be seen in all the videos coming out of Bakhmut at the moment, often with brutal trench assaults. The Russians tend to attack over open ground in crude mass attacks and are shot down by the defenders. The Ukrainians tend to operate more carefully, using single armoured vehicles as lead supports, and crawl up to the enemy trenches and then take them using dozens of grenades. At any rate it is evident that the lack of artillery ammunition is straining not only the Russian battlefield capabilities but also their political sphere. And as I have thought, the only way things will get moving in Russia politically is if (or when) they suffer large military defeats, especially losing Crimea. Until then it will remain glacial.  
  
Kyiv has been bombarded again in a wave of drone attacks but this time the Patriot systems are working and the damage has been limited. Meanwhile, the most interesting explosions going off in Russia have been the two at the spire of the Kremlin, just at the base of the flagpole, in the night of May 5th. Theories are out that it was either the Russians doing it to themselves, the Ukrainians, or partisans. So really no-one knows anything. It did not do any real damage but made for quite a visual spectacle. I personally suspect partisans. I can't see any advantage whatsoever that the Kremlin would gain from bombing itself, and the Ukrainians don't seem to have any interest in this type of symbolic stuff.",False,1683503187.0,t3_13ac6sh,t3_13ac6sh,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

The thing you realize when you watch or read literature about Europe in the late 1800s through the Second World War is that for many of them the Empire doesn't exist. It's a far off thing that they have no real connection to, a sticker of a far off concept. There was a poll in 1948 that showed about half of Brits couldn't name a single British colony, even as India and others were demanding independence. While some Dutch farmers may have understood they were getting easy access to spices due to the possession of what would become Indonesia, what mattered in their lives focused more on *Dutch* farming cycles, not the goings on of distant Suriname.

It's really weird in a way. To Mahatma Gandhi and company, the British Raj was an ever present entity that encroached on so much of their way of life. But even to a random Londoner, the fact that Britain was an empire only seemed to effect the stories in the newspaper. 

Just something to think about. To the average Ukrainian invasion the war is an everpresent threat, an illegal invasion where children are being abducted and robbed of their identity among other things. But if you're not a Russian in Belgorod, it's just a threat to the people being drafted...

Naturally, Russia will be heavily pushing propaganda along those lines in the countries who are supporting Ukraine.  

When things are difficult for people they may start wanting themselves putting first rather than some random abstract foreigners in a war which they think is nothing to do with them. For many people things are already difficult. Prices are going up and money is tight for many people. That's going to make all those ideas seem rather more agreeable.  

It reminds me of the old saying ""Charity starts at home"".  

When people are worried about their jobs, prices, wages and government cuts to even basic services, that old saying is what some people are going to start thinking.  

Putin and China are already weaponising the much needed grain shipments from Ukraine to that end. That combined with Chinese investments in southern nations gives China and Russia a lot of leverage in the UN.  

There's another fear. This particular one isn't something people like to even hear, let alone speak about. There is fear of what will happen if Ukraine starts to run short of people who are able to fight.  

I know that's a horribly morbid thought. I really hate it too. But that's something that diplomats, military intelligences and even Ukrainians themselves have spoken of.  

That last reason alone is why Ukraine and some rather vocal supporters have been begging for even more support than they currently have. There is a fear that time is not on their side.

I think this is what Ukraine means by saying people are going to be disappointed. Ukraine knows that getting large swaths of land back quickly in this phase probably won't happen. Russia has learned from that now and have solidified their lines.  

The Ukrainian goal this summer/spring is to further squeeze the noose around Crimea and to worsen Russia's logistical problems. It's the weak spot for Russia right now. The city of Melitopol or Mariupol is the key for this.

The problem for Ukraine is that Russia has been making it clear by evacuating the area of Melitopol and by building the area into a fortress over the winter that they're willing to make Melitopol and the surrounding areas the next Bakhmut. I don't think Ukraine wants this. 

It's minimum goal I would say is to place Melitopol and it's logistical infrastructure under Ukrainian fire control.  To further squeeze the noose around Crimea.

Russia would have to change the strategic dynamics in a fundamental way to create stalemate.

To contrast with an actual stalemate: 

In WWI along the Western Front, the allies and Germans both had sufficient force to achieve a complete military victory against their enemy, and sufficient force to prevent the enemy from achieving a complete military victory.  

They fought from 1914-1917 without being able to change the strategic situation, as both sides had the economic and demographic resources to maintain that scope and scale of military effort.

In 1918, this changed with Russia exiting the war in the East and the US entering the war in the West.

So, the Germans launched a large scale offensive, knowing that they had a short period of tactical and operational superiority before forces from the United States arrived which would give the allies decisive strategic superiority.

So, 1918 the Germans attempt to use their operational superiority to conquer France and achieve a strategic victory.

The Allies hold, the Americans arrive, the strategic balance of power changes in such a way as so the Germans cannot win.  Germany sues for peace.

Since the arrival of HIMARS, this war has been in the same strategic position as the Allies and Germans in 1918, after the failure of the German's Marne offensive.  Russia cannot win on the battlefield, and given a long enough time span Ukraine will win on the battlefield.

That is not stalemate.

To achieve stalemate the Russians would require some way to consistently threaten Ukrainian long range high precision artillery.

Without a fundamental change in the war, similar, and as dramatic, as the Ukrainian victory in the battle of Kiev, one of three outcomes is possible, (1) Ukraine wins quickly, (2) Ukraine wins slowly, or (3) Ukraine or their weapons suppliers in the West lose the political will to continue the war.",1683483789.0,1683483160.0,t3_13ac6sh,t1_jj8gw7u,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

Well, that's kinda the problem here. The reality of it is that the world doesn't revolve around Ukraine. While it is certainly possible, even likely, that Ukraine can grind down Russia's forces to the point of Russia's war infrastructure to collapse, with the help of Western funding. It is a lot of time and money that is going down the drain to achieve this.

Winning the attrition war is great and all, but its not free, and certainly not cheap. There's also basic politics to consider, where conservatives can gain votes with their ""stop wasting our money"" rhetoric. And if Ukraine can't provide good enough results to show that they can speed it up, there's a chance that we'll see some Western support slowly start to pivot towards convincing Ukraine to seek for peace deal in which they lose territory. Time will tell.

Its entirely possible too that Ukraine can keep it up, regardless of Western backing slowing down.

I'm not sure I'd exactly agree with you about your economic and politic archetypes you've laid out though: capitalism is solely an economic system, and fascism a wedding of a political system to that economic system; I don't see the kleptocracy in Russia as somehow *not* being capitalistic at its core. The capital, the money, still runs the show, but there the system works nearly exclusively for the benefit of the capital holders — the oligarchs, be they business owners or political agents or mobsters. The political system from the Soviet times has been rewired and subverted to benefit the ones with money and power, which brings us back to the aforementioned fascism model, which is why that label works. Throw in some rabid populism to control the common people being exploited and you have the fascism trifecta. 

The concentration of power towards the owners of capital has always been a factor in a capitalist system — I believe Adam Smith even noted this if I am not mistaken. So I don't see an oligarchy as being inherently no longer capitalistic. It's a shitty degenerate form, but remains essentially the same. Oligarchs with disproportional power are arguably a factor to some degree in all capitalist systems, even Western democracies. Some call is a defect, others a virtue. Russia just represents a hyperreal extreme. 

But I think we digress. I'm not sure anyone ever believed in Russian super weapons very much. Developing countries probably believed one could get 80% of the quality at half the cost though, allowing parity to be made up with quantity and still coming out ahead.

That metric has been proven wrong, though, when Western super weapons enter the chat. In the case of the US, the biggest super weapon is arguably the logistics chain, but careful combined arms systematically destroying everything at ranges beyond the enemy's capability to even return fire helps quite a bit. But for developing countries slogging it out, the most common form of warfare, I think the Russians found their niche there for a while. But I think even that has evolved with asymmetrical warfare being fought by both sides simultaneously in these conflicts, which I know doesn't make proper sense be here we are. Wars are fought in the information space as well, which is uncharted territory. Drones and automation are really mixing it up.",False,1683485407.0,t3_13ac6sh,t1_jj8gwn7,,6,3,0,3,0,0,

Because in oligarchy the private ownership is degraded by the oligarchy. Oligarch is not private enterprise as he becomes intertwined with the law proposals. It might not have to, but it will in reality from the incentives. So in essence, the ideal capitalism or capitalistic oligarchy is like a sun with 100 fold mass. You can calculate how bright it would become, but when applied on the space time it becomes a black hole, opposite of what it was supposed to be. With careful application of rules and regulations we can attempt to get closer to ideal capitalism. Main ingredient of capitalism is to be able to legally hold capital in its various forms, for 100 years if necessary. For typical businessmen of Russia this is not true.

On the topic of weapon systems, good example: It was a grave concern that West did not have the wide array and variety of long range MLRS or artillery systems that Russia posessed. All sorts of charts and pictures are out there which describe the impotence of western indirect ground based fires. I think the costs are even intertwined there, how cheaply and numerous Russians can field everything (and sustain, from stockpiles we were told are infinite). But the reality was complete opposite, i am not sure how well this was known before it was actually demonstrated on scale.
