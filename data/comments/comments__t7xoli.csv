> Chief of Staff of the Belarusian Military resigned yesterday, citing the refusal of Battalion level commanders and above to take part in fighting.

Source:  https://twitter.com/faaytuks/status/1500382557250240513?s=21

Then, the following comment:

> Apparently the Battalion commanders stated flatly that they expected the enlisted men to shoot their commanding officers as soon as they were over the border and all fully kitted out, and then either surrender or join the Ukrainians.

> The Belarus troops have not been living in the same disinformation bubble as the Russian troops, most of who had their cell phones taken away from them when they went on their ""exercises"". They both know what a clusterfuck the conflict they are being asked to join is, AND they almost certainly know about the standing offer of amnesty and 5 million rubles(between 30 and 40K USD) that the Ukrainians are offering to every soldier that surrenders of his own accord.

The same can happen now. We don’t need NATO to intervene, that would lead to WW3. We need EU and US (and the rest of the countries) to keep their sanctions, and increase them, until Russian economy is completely crushed. It doesn’t matter how much help they get from China, they can’t cover for US and UE, the two biggest economies in the world. 

Eventually, Russia will collapse and Ukraine will be free.

“The anger here is unbearable,” she said as she walked through the rubble of one of the three residential areas that were flattened by the attacks. “People are really defiant … they are saying they are not going anywhere and if the Russians come we will fight them,” she added.

When I ask if such an organization would be justified, the response is usually an emphatic “yes” citing a long history of U.S. Imperialism.  When I ask why former victims of Soviet/Russian domination are not also justified in seeking the protection of NATO, they usually fall back on some variation of the view that U.S. Imperialism is different, that it is a kind of first cause of all problems, which is almost mystical.   
The bottom line is no country is threatened by defence, unless it is planning offence.

Statement of the MFA of the PMR in connection with the application of the Republic of Moldova to join the EU

We regard the submission by the leadership of the Republic of Moldova of an application for membership in the European Union as a geopolitical decision leading to a change in international borders and spheres of influence in the regional space and radically changing the circumstances of the final settlement of Moldovan-Pridnestrovian relations.

We treat with understanding the decision of the leadership of the neighboring republic.

Meanwhile, the submission of an application by the Republic of Moldova for accession to the EU in the context of a long-term unresolved conflict between Pridnestrovie and Moldova, without taking into account the opinion and outside the framework of consultations with the Pridnestrovian side, while completely ignoring the discussion of this issue in existing negotiation formats, including the international platform of the ""Permanent Conference ..."", puts an end to the settlement process, which requires urgent international legal formalization.

In the current new circumstances, including those created by the actions of the Moldovan leadership, we call on the Moldovan side to start a dialogue with Pridnestrovie with the aim of a final civilized settlement of relations based on the peaceful, good-neighborly existence of two independent states by signing a comprehensive interstate agreement.",False,1646580678.0,t3_t7xoli,t3_t7xoli,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Current members are: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan

Up until the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan had been granted observer status.


#• UN - United Nations

The United Nations are an intergovernmental organization aiming to maintain global peace. Every sovereign state is a member of the UN (193) with the EU having an additional Observer Status. 

The current Secretary General of the UN is Antonio Guterres

#• UNSC - United Nations Security Council

The Security council has the power to make binding decisions which UN member states have to carry out, since they have agreed to that by signing the UN Charta (Art 25). 

The UNSC consists of 15 members, of which 5 members are permanent members (The US, France, UK, China and Russia) - only the 5 permanent members have the power to Veto a UN resolution, and 10 non-permanent members (Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, UAE) which are elected for two year terms by the UN assembly. 

The presidency of the UNSC rotates alphabetically between the member states every month:

Jan - Norway ; **Feb - Russia** ; March - UAE ; Apr - UK ; May - US ; June - Albania ; July - Brazil ; Aug - China ; Sept - France ; Oct - Gabon ; Nov - Ghana ; Dec - India

#• DPR (DNR) and LPR (LNR) - Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic

Are two self-proclaimed breakaway Regions in eastern Ukraine which were officially recognised as independent states by Russia on Feb 21 in the prelude to this war.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

#• Putin contemplates invoking martial law - what does that mean?

Martial law essentially means the suspension of civil law and that the army or military bodies will enforce strict rules like for example curfew's or to prohibit big public gatherings of people.

Usually martial law is invoked to suppress people and prevent them from rising up and voicing their dissent with the current ruling party. 

In this instance it would likely mean that russian people wont be able to protest the war anymore without gettinf severely punished. [will be updated once we know more - rumor has it that it will be announced friday the 4th]

It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  The problem is, we are facing a real life ethical nightmare. It's called ""The Trolley Problem"": 


>The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.  


https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/trolley-problem-moral-philosophy-ethics


In this case, Russia is the Trolley, the 5 people represent the world at large, and the 1 person represents Ukraine.  This is the decision the world faces in a very real sense.  


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

I think a lot of people on here are too young to of lived through the fall of the USSR as well. It's one thing to read it in a history book (which is awesome. I love history) and another to of lived through it. I vividly remember seeing images and videos of their grocery stores. Empty aisles, no basic necessities, no bread or milk, etc. They lived in almost mass poverty, or as very lower middle class. The elites lived the great life during the USSR's height. Those are the ones who remember the ""great Soviet Union"". They were so absorbed in the arms race and influencing communism across the world after the victory in WW2. The money and resources never made it to the common man or woman. They had little money, poor access to health care and education. The rest of the world felt towards them much like they do currently with Russia. They hated the regime, but felt for its people.

As far as I can tell, what Putin has done is played himself and everyone else. He's got his intelligence to produce reports on outlandish and insane plans (from their perspective) and being patriotic they predict massive success. He's taken those plans, as hard evidence, to his inner circle, who whilst an economic cabal, do not really know the first thing about military action else would have immediately identified all the faults in the intelligence reports. As a result, they take them at face value and greenlight what they think will be a cakewalk where Ukraine capitulates in 3 days. A massive, easy win that will give them Ukraine's resources to exploit and make them even richer.

All the evidence is of this being the case. Nothing is set up for a sustained war with serious pushback. Logistics in disarray. Total lack of military engineering units amongst the invasion force. No bridge builders, no road fixers, no railway repair teams. Lots of modern equipment not battlefield ready, sitting in maintenance yards hundreds of miles from the border.

Nobody other than Putin really wants this war. They really don't want it to boil over and above everything they won't want it to go nuclear. Even if Putin has lost it, they haven't.

Putin might want to push the button if NATO (or anyone else aligned to them) joins Ukraine, but nobody else in Russia will want to. They aren't prepared to end the world over Ukraine. It just doesn't make sense.

The only question is whether anyone has the power to stop the process if Putin pushes the button. If he doesn't have absolute control, then it's time to intervene. If he does, maybe backchannel communications saying ""sort him out or we'll wipe the floor with Russia's forces"" are what's needed.

Engines for airlines should be easier to produce than military engines - no afterburners, less stress on the engines (g forces, rapid changes in power levels, etc) and their power to weight ratio isn't as critical if the airliner can live with 1960s fuel efficiency. You don't need cutting edge nodes for the microchips on an airliner either. As far as design goes, I could see Russia just reverse engineering the existing engines - they've done that before.

As long as they can mine raw materials or source them from China, I could see them scaling up and producing parts for airliners domestically.

Here's why:

North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have all been under heavy sanctions and their governments have not been toppled yet. In fact, despite several big protests at times (Venezeula) nothing changes. 

And it definitely won't happen in Russia because:

1. Russia will still survive on selling gas to Europe, China and countless trade deals with India.
2. Russia's population is already accustomed to harsh economic conditions and this is actually a return to normal for Russia.
3. Russia likes authoritative leaders and Putin still probably has majority support
4. All the independent liberal thinkers end up leaving Russia and will continue to do so, leaving a population who is totally fine with Putin....à la Venezuela

I am almost certain that you'd be the first to scramble over the heads and necks of your unarmed fellows to get away from the armed fucker as possible, and make yourself as small as possible.

Understand human psychology - and this isn't Russia only thing. It's a human only thing - and you might eventually figure out how to end this. I prefer to liken Russia to an abused spouse.

It's just that abusers hold such control over the abused. They isolate them completely. And they eventually make you believe that, sure, he beats her, but he's also the only one who loves her. And she believes him. She will fucking fistfight the police come to split up a domestic dispute to protect her abusive spouse. And all the bystanders are frustrated as fuck, until they give up on her.

That's Russia generalised. Its people are the battered wife. It's not even about sympathy anymore. You may not feel sympathy for the battered wife caping for her husband at all, but not only is it the right thing to do to condition her to rise up and leave, but it saves her family too, because her family's hurting. And in this case, her family is the rest of us here in Eastern Europe, no one more so than Ukraine, who is.... basically Russia's mother.

Not only that, but as sanctions are increasingly severe in nature, the more that the average Russian citizen is affected; I think initially the sanctions were designed to avoid this as much as possible, but with further conflict I think NATO and the EU would be given no choice.

Firstly, complete disconnection from the SWIFT network. 

Secondly, halting of importation of all goods into Russia, including food, medicine and humanitarian aid.

Thirdly, further seizure of assets.

Fourthly, complete halting of purchasing of Russian oil and gas - this would be a major one.

As well as those formal sanctions, individual companies divesting from Russia add momentum to the economic fallout, especially when those companies are unlikely to reinvest for the foreseeable future, even if Putin agreed to back off. There's no point having Prada shops when people can't eat, after all.

This whole thing is extremely, extremely sad. Millions of Ukrainians **and** Russians will suffer for a very long time as a result of Putin's miscalculated narcissism. Putin genuinely improved the quality of life for Russian citizens in his initial 10 years - if he stopped there, he'd have honestly had the legacy that he now seems to be desperate to grip on to, ""The saviour of Russia"".

I know everyone wants to help Ukraine. But think about what is going on.

You might lose planes but pilots are harder to replace. You can’t train a pilot quickly. That’s why they are sending older migs. Because western aircraft are different and take a lot of time to learn how to use. 

Ukrainian shot done over Ukraine can just hop in another jet if there is one. Like the Brits and Poles did during the Battle of Britain.

But I don't blame the Russian people at all (Well, mostly I don't. There's always some culpability for letting your government get away with shit, but I'm just as guilty of it).

Hell, I probably should have left the US during the Iraq war because I hated the US during it, but I stayed and kept spending money and paying taxes, so I get it. It's hard to leave your home.

I've been reading some IT forums, as I'm also in IT, and just about anyone with any technical skills is desperately trying to get the hell out of Russia right now (and refer to it as 'escaping', not leaving). 

Leaving behind their homes, families, jobs (well not so much jobs anymore, so many companies have already exited Russia and/or had to close up shop and lay everyone off and/or can't pay their employees because international payment networks cut Russia off), and most of their investments (because they had to try to get foreign currency in a hurry, at a massive markup, when already their rubles have halved in value in a week, and Russia also won't let you leave with too much of foreign currency). 

And they can only fly to a handful of countries because so many other countries already have shut off their airspace to Russian planes. And when they get there, they have a hard time finding new jobs because a lot of people there are avoiding hiring them (supposedly). 

They're already super freaked out and hurting, and that's going to cause a massive brain drain in Russia that will hurt it for decades to come. And many of these people have family members in Ukraine as well, so they're worried for them as well.

Probably why Russia should declare martial law even though they're swearing they won't (until they come up with a good false pretext for it, probably), as it would stop these people from leaving.

If I were in their position I would like to think I would have already left months ago, but maybe I wouldn't. I'm sure I'd be desperately trying to flee the country by now, though.

sigh.  Because implementing a NFZ escalates the situation.  We'd then have to enforce it and that means NATO directly engaging Russia.  That is very, very dangerous.  It raises the stakes.  Russia knows it can't win against NATO so its only options is to surrender (not likely from an authoritarian tyrant), or to find a way to level the playing field.  The only way Russia can even the odds is with nukes.  

>If we implement a full no fly zone, shoot the shit out of Russian planes over the skies of Ukraine, why should we assume Putin would kill himself by launching a nuke?

Again, because Russia has been terrified of NATO for 70 years.  From Russia's perspective, NATOs entire purpose was to eventually start a war and conquer Russia.  So will Putin and the military believe NATO will stop at Ukraine's borders now that they've done what Russia has always feared, which is start a direct war with Russia?  So to them, NATO joining a war against Russia is NATO starting ww3.  NATO implementing a NFW is NATO making the first aggressive move.   At that point all bets are off.  If Russia believes (and they do) NATO has been building its forces against Russia for decades, then implementing MAD is the only option left.  

In short, in Russia's mind, if NATO enters the war, its ww3 and Russia's existence is on the line.  It immediately becomes bigger than just Ukraine.  Russia can say ""A ha! I knew it! NATO finally did it and started the war we've always feared would happen!"".  The only way Russia can defend against NATO is with nukes.  If Russia is going to be destroyed anyway (NATO is going to destroy Russia once it starts a war), might as well take NATO down with them.

Since the war started the propaganda machine finally started and really managed to warp the reality for most people, they really believe that Russian people are saviors here, they believe there are nazis (and there really are some, check Azov battalion, part of Ukraine's defense forces, so it's not all a lie), that the Ukrainians worship a nazi war criminals (Stepan Bandera has streets named in his name and he worked with nazis, true, but Russian news never mentioned that most of all he wanted independence for Ukraine), that Russian soldiers are welcomed warmly (and it might be true as well in Donbass, where Russian propaganda and the same Azov battalion did a lot to make people love Russia more than Ukraine).

But they never hear about destruction of Kharkiv, about the intense fights going around the Ukraine, about the atrocities of Russian soldiers, about the locals not wanting the Russian army to come and pushing tanks wigh their bare hands.

For a normal Russian only watching the news this is a small scale conflict where only Ukrainian bastards can cause loss of life and Russia is trying to save Ukraine from Ukrainians. It's not even on TV the whole time, just a segment in 8 o'clock news where they show happy people of Donbass getting humanitarian aid and brave Donbass soldiers (not Russian soldiers, they are only there to assist) fighting for their land. 

Look at Russia's UN statements with all this in mind, look at the Putin's speeches. This is what reality for an average Russian looks like and for them it's not big enough to cause a revolt.

What blows my mind and maybe our missile tech has just gotten that much better, but I would think the anti-missile defenses, specifically the flares for the infrared seeking portable manpads would work a bit better than the numbers we're seeing.

But also part of me wonders if it's from corruption or lack of resources as this is from an article in 2018 about SU-25's over Syria had this to say:

>Russian observers remarked that an absence of infra-red decoy flares being ejected from the Su-25 shown in the videos is unusual. It is common to see a series of bright flares ejected from an aircraft as a countermeasure to heat-seeking anti-aircraft missiles.

Second, Japan and Germany were defeated before nuclear era. Russia possesses, iirc, the biggest nuclear arsenal. If they see their existence threatened like Germany and Japan in WW2, I don’t see them not using their nukes.

Finally, if NATO and/or EU is attacked, I see people of these countries rallying to support our defense. But I very much doubt they’ll support crushing Russia, with the inevitable enormous looses that would bring.

Coptic Orthodox have their own Pope however.

But pretty much Greek Orthodox for lack of a better term is the ""head"" orthodox church.


EDIT: adding in below a comment I've made in previous live threads about orthodox christianity.

Russian Orthodox tried a mini coup of sorts almost 10 years ago by separating from the Greek Orthodox, with it's patriarchal seat in since Byzantine times in Constantinople, even through today to Istanbul. The Russians have basically since forever been claiming themselves as ""the third rome"" since the Greeks up until their independence still referred to themselves as Romans.

They've (the Russian Orthodox church) since split into their own leadership (like how the Coptic Orthodox have their own pope) where as before they would take direction from Istanbul, all because the Greek Orthodox Church gave Ukrainian Orthodox churches the right to self govern themselves, but still take direction from Istanbul. Previously the Russians had the Ukrainians under the umbrella.

Ukrainians hold the key road coming from Sumi through Konotop and Russians couldn't break through the ambushes. So they went SW through the countryside and dashed like 100km fairly quickly but suffered several big ambushes near Purluky and Sribne. They pushed on further to Nova Basan like 5 days ago and Berezan? like 3 days ago.

But no one know how much of that space they actually controlled and given how bad their logistics were is they could sustain forces that far out. Plus the reports of contact in that area were sparse mostly recon elements. The Ukrainian army claimed they got that far because they had vehicles flying the Ukrainian flag and basically speed as fast as they could to get as far as they could.

But if their using 2 MLRS means it aint forward recon elements anymore. Though if it was an actual column they would have more than just 2 GRADs. So it's still iffy how close they are to forming a line on Eastern Kyiv. But that would be really bad and pressure the defenders hard.

7bfae43db34122c5cfff0338e108996e,t7xoli,hzkyffs,"I'll bite.  Let's talk about Libya/Chad/Eritrea/Sudan, but mostly Darfur.  Things have been terrible there since at least the 1970s and 1980s when there was civil war in both Chad and Sudan.  That sort of set the stage for the Islamic coup in 1989 by Omar al-Bashir. Since then the inefficiency and lack of government oversight has fostered an environment decimated by corruption and war.  So this gets confusing and I apologize if I get any of this wrong, but my understanding is that you had:

1. The National Islamic Front run by Omar al-Bashir and Dr. Hassan al-Turabi that overthrew the existing Sudanese Government.  It began a systematic marginalization of the non-arab population, especially in Darfur.  His government has fostered extensive levels of corruption, oppression, and death.
2. As a result of that marginalization, the Darfur Liberation Front was created and eventually morphed into the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army.  In 2006 that broke into separate Minnawi and al-Nur factions, and there have been multiple other splinter groups since.
3. The Janjaweed was created in part by Libya and Sudan as they provided supplies and arms for the Arab nomads to fight in border-clash disputes against Chad.  Later this same group was armed as a counter-insurgency group to the SLA after they started winning significant military engagements in the early-mid 2000s.  There was little oversight however and the Janjaweed ended up operating as bandits who raped, murdered, and tortured non-Arab people including children.
4. Next you have Eritrea, who has had on-going border disputes with Sudan and at least partially supported the SLA and other rebels.  Note that this is the same Eritrea that just backed Russia in their war against Ukraine.

In August of 2006 the United Nations approved a resolution to send a peacekeeping force of \~17000 into the region with strong opposition from Sudan who basically said the UN had no right to come in and try to police the region.  Later that year the US imposed sanctions on Sudan that froze assets of those involved in the genocide and shored up other existing sanctions, partially in an effort to get Sudan to agree to let the UN in.  They rejected those plans.  Eventually in 2007 a hybrid UN/AU peacekeeping force was approved.  Since then there have been various atrocities committed by the Sudanese government and on-again-off-again peace talks.

So, given all of that.  What should the west do about this conflict?  Should we overthrow the Sudan government because of what they've done in Darfur?  The situation in Ukraine is far easier in some ways.  Russia clearly broke their agreement with Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum and is invading and killing the people of a sovereign nation.  It's easy to support Ukraine because they were in no way aggressors and have an internationally recognized right to exist and govern themselves.

In the case of Sudan though, can the world come in and replace the (admittedly illegitimate) government of Sudan because we don't like what they are doing to innocent people in their own country?  It's far less straightforward than the situation in Ukraine.",1646580384.0,1646579029.0,t3_t7xoli,t1_hzkmp9z,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.
 
**[Dead Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand)** 
 
 >Dead Hand (Russian: Система «Периметр», Systema ""Perimetr"", lit. ""Perimeter"" System, with the GRAU Index 15E601, Cyrillic: 15Э601), also known as Perimeter, is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear weapons-control system (similar in concept to the American AN/DRC-8 Emergency Rocket Communications System) that was used by the Soviet Union. The system remains in use in the post-Soviet Russian Federation.
 
**[Nuclear holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust)** 
 
 >A nuclear holocaust, nuclear apocalypse or atomic holocaust is a theoretical scenario where the mass detonation of nuclear weapons causes globally widespread destruction and radioactive fallout. Such a scenario envisages large parts of the Earth becoming uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear warfare, potentially causing the collapse of civilization and, in the worst case, extinction of humanity and/or termination of life on earth.

The clip is about the response of the West in general, and those incidents are only about Ukrainians and Poles. Ukrainians just changed focus towards the West 8 years ago, and Belarus have weaponized MENA immigrants against the Poles the past year.

Secondly, I don't know if you noticed this, but there is an actual war going on. No, not the type of ""war"" that leaves the women and children at home while the men flee *en masse.* It's the opposite type of war. The one were the men are forced to fight and are seen as cowards if they flee.

In this context, of course *any* male refugee will be treated worse, regardless of their color. If these people were white, everyone would support this too. Of course, this does not excuse actual racism, but again not only is Poles and Ukrainians not representative of the West as a whole, but individual un-proven cases are not necessarily representative of them in general either.

Thirdly, I hear no complaint over all the men who are forced to stay at home which you'd think would be *massively* worse discrimination if you really wanted to play that game.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Sure it does. Once this hits the occupation stage, Russia can't shoot back at the Ukrainian resistance without committing atrocities against civilians. They will be essentially at war with the Ukrainian people, and that makes the occupation difficult to justify politically to international opinion or the Russian people; there's no doubt which side those civilians are on. You might call this objectionable - but it's pretty much been part and parcel of modern warfare since World War 2 or thereabouts. It's why the Ukrainians are going to win this war even if Russia takes the country, (which is looking less and less likely).

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

I think people become so politically-cynical these days because the political system and the abundance of laws and different interpretations and sub categeories like EU laws, have become so many that barely anybody can still see the full picture. While common sense would dictate you to act and solve a problem, the democratic political system, if it is so convoluted, will take months or years at best to address that problem. And in a world where 'change' is faster and more unpredictable, it becomes less effective and more slow. In my country there was a minister for 20 years, and during this time she had an ambition to just solve 1 obvious problem, that was awfully expensive for the tax payer for no reason, and they just couldn't fix it, couldn't get it to be an issue to be voted upon, too many differences within parties etc. What is it worth if you are minister and cant fix 1 single law that is detrimental to everyone because it is so old? She resigned because it felt to depressive to her to continue. 



When I look at organized crime gangs and them abusing EU subsidies to found new firms which they let go insolvent a year later, while getting extra funds for hiring workers from the state and Covid money for potential losses. What is the bureaucracy worth if you can't address these issues? In my country the population is aging which leads that teacher, police men, critical infrastructure jobs, lawyers are missing in the future or now already. Instead of making life easier for the young generation or middleaged generation, we just burden them more to pay for the pensions of the increasing old generation. Birthrates are low, because it is too expensive to get kids or even buy an apartment. What do our politicans do? Open the doors for immigration, but they are mostly uneducated. So what does it solve... it only increased gang criminality while they abuse the social system. Meanwhile our politicans have auto-inflationadjusted high salaries, carefree life. They noticed its bad press to increase the salary every year in the parlament, so the increase is automatically now. And what jobs did politicans learn? Some were journalists, psychologists, studied politics, or worked in banks - this is the majority. They don't have a perspective for what jobs are really important in a society.

Of course. It's happened throughout history. Countries like India are criticized because they are big trading partners of Russia, so by not helping with the sanctions they are making them less effective- and the sanctions are seen as the only weapon we have against this unprovoked aggression. At the beginning of these sanctions people were criticizing Switzerland and Germany quite heavily too when it looked like they wouldn't be joining in. Not everything is racial.

 
> Look at the US responding to it, and again the sympathy itself shouldn’t be limited to only people that “look like me”.

A lot of the American response is due to Russia's involvement, not because we're a ""racist country who only cares about white people."" Russia is and has been our biggest rival with a nuclear arsenal as big as ours. So *obviously* we are going to be very concerned when they start invading neighbors. We'd be stupid not to be.

China is not actually communist, but they hope to one day have enough development to become communist. Or something. It's not very clear, but right now it's state capitalist. Yeah they have really improved global standards of living by propping up north Korea, the junta in Myanmar, and Russia. They want to legitimise their authoritarian model of government, and they want to deal with other autocracies because it's easier. They undermine democracy at every turn. China can prosper, but if they rise to be able to take on the US military, then things become dangerous.

Proximity I buy as you're mostly likely to be murdered by someone you know.  So Middle Easterners kill Middle Easterners and Africans kill Africans cause their countries are closed to each other.  Now whites are killing whites in Europe in something that could spin into a conflict that'd kill people of all colors.  But let's focus right now, as a nuclear armed madman is trying to reshape the world, on why white people aren't as focused on ""minority"" (more non-whites on the globe than whites) people killed in basically little dust ups relatively speaking (that is relative to the potential of a regional war that could easily go nuclear).  Right.  Well tell you what, ""people like you"" (whatever that is and I reiterate you used those words first) worry about the violence you do, and receive, and try to find the most peaceful place you can be while the rest of us worry about the most dangerous conflict in the world at the moment.

You could've fooled me with all that saber-rattling about nuking us!

But also because the Chinese made better choices and have had a more organized strategy for self-improvement.

>Taiwan will never choose to be ruled from Beijing, as they have seen what happened in Hong Kong, and they are not stupid.

That remains to be seen. If China becomes extremely prosperous and begins to look as attractive to Taiwanese as Europe looks to Ukrainians, then we might see movement in the other direction. People have always been shown to prioritize financial security and wellbeing over intangibles like self-governance.

>Yeah they have really improved global standards of living by propping up north Korea,

The very very low price we pay on almost everything is due to the fact that it's made in China by a competent people who've designed their cities around efficient supply chains and production of goods.

>They want to legitimise their authoritarian model of government,

Yeah, that's unfortunate, but we can mitigate that by showing what freedom offers.

People did care about Crimea in 2014? It was widely criticised and reported on as bad, and people showed sympathy for Ukraine, it just wasn’t as big as this is. I am just saying you brought up Libya going to
War as a reason to not care as much which is why I brought up crimea it’s not really comparable to what went on to happen.

A smattering of inconsequential sanctions were placed in 2014 that served to embolden Putin and lead to today's situation.  20-30 billion of offensive deadly aid to Ukraine then and likely we wouldn't be here now.  The response was tepid at best from all of the West much less the responses from other enablers of Putin.  

I didn't group any countries together except to say we had become numbed to violence in the middle east.  Hell Israel has become numb to rocked flying at them. It is what happens when things just continue in the same way.  As I didn't say that it isn't part of my issue.  I also didn't say Middle Eastern countries were destined to be at war with one another.  In fact I pointed out the huge money we give Israel and Egypt to not fight.

The world agreed? Pretty funny because I don’t remember the Palestinians or Arabs around Israel agreeing.

It is not a “Muslim vs Jewish” thing at all it’s the fact that they established Israel a Jewish only state in an area of people who weren’t Jewish and did not want to give up their homes. It was a stupid idea it failed with India and Pakistan as well which happened at the same time the only difference is that it hold religious significance for high so they are incentivised to feel like they deserved to live there.
