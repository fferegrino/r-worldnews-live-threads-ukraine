Day 291 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a very quiet and uneventful day, which is great. There were no missile or drone strikes, but we had air raid alerts going off one after another. We had 6 alerts in total today, most of them were because of Russian UAV/aircraft activity along our borders, but also during one of the alerts air defenses in Belgorod were actively trying to shoot something down.

The situation with electricity in Kharkiv is pretty stable, especially compared to most other cities. Today we saw less buildings around us without power than usual, though the blackouts do continue. My apartment building, and other ones of the same type of soviet apartment buildings seem to get blackouts very selectively, as in, only some parts of the building sit without electricity while others have it. 

It’s grouped kinda weirdly, for example my building has 12 entrances/parts, and right now of those 12 only the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 7, 8, 9 get blackouts, while the numbers 4, 5, 6 and 10, 11, 12 rarely get them, so my part of the building didn’t have any blackouts in the last week. They also change the groups sometimes, because about a month ago the two groups were just – 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

Yesterday there were news saying that Odesa might have no electricity for the next 2-3 months because of the drone strike on the energy infrastructure in the morning, which would have been a complete disaster. But today it was clarified that the 2-3 months number was how long it would take to repair all the damage that was done, and not how long there would be no electricity in the city. That one wrong message created enough panic that the one who posted it is now being investigated by SBU, so that was a pretty big fuckup.

The differences are: airpower and artillery. Namely, Russia has *much* less of both.

Russia‘s firepower in Bakhmut is probably 10 times more than what Ukraine has. They vastly outgun Ukraine. But they probably have 10 times less now than in Popasna. And the airpower is incomparable.

In Popasna, Russia dropped incredible amounts of ordinance. They destroyed everything. Ukraine took *massive* casualties. Russia is currently incapable of this type of bombardment in Bakhmut. And I doubt they will ever have this capability again.

Long story short, as the war goes on, Russia‘s capabilities drain away. They have finite resources, and expending insane resources on any one objective just means they have less for whatever comes next.

In the aftermath of WW1, Poland was resurrected from Germany/Russia, and Ukraine was a nation trying to establish itself and grain recognition. In its goal to expand its borders to wherever Polish people were living, Poland invaded and fought Ukraine over Eastern Galicia, the area where modern Lviv is located. This was part of a lot of confusing and chaotic wars in eastern Europe in the few years after WW1 ended.

So this is what Putin is referring to, trying to play on non-existent fears rooted in history that's over 100 years old... the same time in history when Ukraine was part of imperial Russia.

From wiki:

Following the expiration in 2017 of the 1994 agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which granted Tatarstan substantial autonomy, the title of President was expected to be replaced with Head of the Republic, as it was done with all other [Russian republics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_Russia).[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-1) The government of Tatarstan resisted attempts to have the title abolished and the federal government declined to press the issue.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-2)

However, shortly after a [legislative election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_legislative_election) held in September 2021, a bill was submitted to the [State Duma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma) to unify the titles of the leaders of all Russia's regions to ""Head"".[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-3) The bill, widely seen as directly aimed at Tatarstan, would ban the title ""President"" throughout the country and reserve it exclusively for the [President of Russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Russia).[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-4) In response lawmakers in the [State Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Council_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan) voted against the bill.[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-5) The bill was approved in its first reading in November.[[6]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-6) On 15 December, it was approved by the [Federation Council](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_Council) and subsequently signed by President [Vladimir Putin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) on 21 December.[[7]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-7)

The law went into effect on 1 June 2022.[[8]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-8) Tatarstan's presidential secretary said that the title will remain during a transitional period throughout 2022 where the constitution will be amended.[[9]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-9) The title change will occur by 1 January 2023.[[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-10) The loss of the title was mourned by both the ruling elite and ordinary citizens of Tatarstan, who perceived it as a further erosion of their autonomy within Russia.[[11]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan#cite_note-11)",False,1670760526.0,t3_zie640,t1_izrrfw6,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

I think that is a very debatable point. They may have captured a ton of equipment from the Russians, enough to field several new mechanized units, they have also received a lot of equipment from the west enough to modernize their most of their professional army. However, they have also lost a ton of equipment themselves, especially in the opening phase of the war. 

And not only that, they are becoming more and more reliant on western manufacture equipment, especially artillery, where not only is Ukraine lacking in barrels, they are lacking in ammunition as well. 

You also need to account for the fact that Ukraine can't simply move all spare units to the frontline. They have to protect the northern border with Belarus, even if the prospects of an invasion through Belarus remain low, while Russia can pretty much pull most of its army from all other borders, including the ones with NATO countries, because it is fully aware that it is under no immediate threat of an invasion. 

There is also another factor. Russia started mobilization, and though it has already started committing a lot of that mobilized personnel into the fight, they are still keeping some of it back, in training in Russia that they likely plan to use in their next offensive, probably next year. So Ukraine needs to have some reserves of its own to deal with that, they can't just go all in hoping to break Russia's will to fight before Christmas.",False,1670772122.0,t3_zie640,t1_izsf82u,,1,33,0,33,0,0,

[I am not trained military. I have no intension of diminishing the *value of surviving*.  I am not suggesting the western militaries change tank design ]

It is not a popular opinion... but T72s and T80s are ""high quality tanks"".  The life expectancy of a T72 crew is much lower than the life expectancy of an M1 tank crew.  This is not a trivial difference.  Both the crew and their mothers want them back alive.  

However, look what you actually have in hand when the tank gets somewhere.  You get two machine guns in an elevated position.  One coaxial and one independent.  Then one big fat gun.  The T72's gun is actually a few millimeters bigger.  A 125mm tank gun does anything a 125mm howitzer could do.  The offensive capability is identical..  The T72s are fast light weight and they use half as much gas as M1s.  The lower weight means they can cross bridges or utilize smaller transports.  All tanks are nearly useless once they run out of gas.  Worse than useless if parked in a field with no gas and then captured by the enemy.  

You can throw four times as many T72s into the fight and lose half of them.  Then the remaining half only need the same refueling as the M1.  If a Su27 drops a 500 lb bomb on your tank you are down a tank but then it is better to have 3 spares.  A land mine will bust the tread on both M1s and T72s.",False,1670794628.0,t3_zie640,t1_izsxkq2,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

The average salary for US soldiers is around 40,000 per year (if not almost 70,000, you'll find lots of different numbers), which means that around 50 billion only go into salaries (or over 90 billion if you assume an average salary of 70k).

For the same reason it'd be really useful to Ukraine to take, splitting the Russian forces in half and making them go the very long way around the Azov sea with limited logistics for the next 6 months maybe, it's something the Russians can afford to lose the least.

They've always kept significant forces there, no matter how bad Kherson or Kharkiv got. This is something Arestovych said a couple of months back, the Russians ""are terrified of losing there"". 

In that situation an offensive in the Svatove area would put additional pressure on the Russian army to thin their lines in the Hulyaipole area. Risk losing the so-called republics to keep that strategically important area, or risk losing the strategically important area to keep the so-called republics.

Best case scenario Ukraine does a push in the Svatove area, Russia moves forces from the Hulyaipole area leaving that weakened, then Ukraine adds a second push in the Hulyaipole area towards the azov sea while the Svatove area collapses and Russia loses it anyway along with a big risk of losing the south east.

Worst case scenario (in the better scenarios of course) Russia keeps forces in the south east and Ukraine steamrolls over the north east and the so-called Republics. Putin takes one right in the eye in the loss of a lot of the territory they've gained/held since 2014.

Remotely operated drones might not do well in an EW heavy conflict zone. An expendable weapons platform is usually more efficient than a survivable weapons platform unless air defenses are weakened. That's why Kamakazis exist, and were used by virtually all sides in WWII.

As one military commander once put it, the ideal drone is a missile. It has one target, can guide in on it without needing a human operator, and it doesn't need to be retrieved. 

Some survivable unmanned platforms will have a place in the future of warfare, especially in cases where manning the system would be impossible or impractical. On the one level, planes like th B-21 have the ability to be optionally unmanned. You'll also have semi-autonymous drone support planes flying along side and being commanded by manned platforms. You can even had the weapons racks for manned aircraft be detachable semi-autonymous wingmem to a manned aircraft. There can be drone jammer and decoys flying around to defend the other aircraft in a strike group. You might even see unmanned cargo planes resupplying Frontline units, or carrying massive amounts of ordinance that can be commaned by manned aircraft.

 But nobody credible in the military is advocating for large strikes with only drones, aside from a program called rapid dragon where the idea is to send swarms of glide bombs released from a cargo plane. But there isn't any intention to retrieve those drone. They all go boom. 

But the most expensive platforms, the ones you want back, are usually going to be accompanied by a manned aircraft that can stop it from being hijacked by enemy EW. Or you're going to use cheap unmanned ISTAR aircraft that can fly longer than a person can stay awake in counter insurgent missions.

The reality is that the Ukrainian  counteroffensive in Luhansk ran out of steam, both due to the weather - it started to run out of steam just as the muddy season began. But also due to the mobilization effort of the Russians, who basically threw bodies at the frontline in order to hold the Ukrainians. These two factors, plus i'm sure significant Ukrainian casualties after over 2 months of offensive operations since it began in early September, caused the Ukrainian advance in Luhansk to slow down to a crawl, to the point where the Russians were even able to launch some small, but fairly successful counter attacks of their own. The Ukrainians are still advancing in that sector, but as i said, their pace has been slowed down to an absolute crawl.

There is tremendous value in demoralizing the enemy, and I think the idea of attacking training centers is not the worst idea in the world.

As they get closer to the border this will become inevitable. So when exactly do they start?

These are complex questions that I’m not suggesting I have good answers for. But the idea is not stupid. Targeting civilians in Russia, Tit-for-tat, for example is stupid for the moral high ground argument you brought. Targeting soldiers is war. 

So no, not frivolous. I’m not fond of the idea myself, but it isn’t inherently stupid either.

What made the Soviet invasion so much scarier was precisely the demonstrated Soviet disregard for their own massive losses.  There would be no political backlash in the U.S.S.R. for the devastating consequences of a ground invasion of Japan; hence, the Japanese knew they couldn't use diplomacy to force an acceptance of conditional surrender.


When the nuclear bombs started falling (consecutively, and with the deliberate intent to create the impression that the US could continue dropping nukes at the pace of one or two a week - which we absolutely could not), the Japanese realized that there was no threat of massive troop loss to discourage a democratic electorate from supporting the military campaign.  So the US government would have full support and electoral assurance to continue the military campaign unabated.

He was obviously very talented at his exhibitionist-style Aikido, but Aikido people typically get utterly destroyed in tournaments; because it's not really practical for civilian self-defense or any kind of ""real"" fighting. (yes, it is popular with police, because it has a lot of great moves for taking down untrained unarmed knobs, while you're buddy's backing you up with guns, tasers, and can call for radio backup).

Now: Aikido is basically an offshoot of Jujitsu which is a legitimate martial art, that has a good track record in tournament fighting (both jujitsu, and in MMA).  Aikido techniques were selected for ""non-lethality"" because that was the philosophy of the guy who invented it. It was really meant for hobbyist enthusiasts, not actual practitioners. 

That said; I studied the Korean copy of Aikido, Hapkido (which is basically Aikido with a bunch of Shotokan karate mixed in, because Koreans knew Aikido wouldn't stand up on its own) - and I accidentally injured a friend who now has lifelong problems with his hand, because of an Aikido/Hapkido move that didn't go as planned because he didn't react the way an opponent usually does in training. One of my teachers also got his knee very badly fucked up, and even after a knee replacement, ended up having to use a cane just to walk. 

Judo on the other hand, was also an offshoot of Jujitsu. Not as philosophical as Aikido; definitely doesn't have a use for all the magical mumbo-jumbo.  Judo was designed as a competitive sport, in a way that protected competitors from life-altering injuries (like getting knees blown out, - - a lot of MMA tournaments also use judo-like rules to ban certain moves that had a tendency to fuck up fighters so they couldn't compete anymore - - same with boxing, frankly: boxer use those gloves to protect their hands from spiral fractures. Not to protect their opponents' head).

So when it comes to Putin's competence, he supposedly has a good reputation in Judo matches.  But people who've studied films of those matches, or watched them, saw the obvious cues that his opponents let him win, because he was fucking Vladimir Putin.
