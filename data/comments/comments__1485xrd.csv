https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-13-23/index.html

""Ukraine is claiming that it has gained ground from Russia in the southern Zaporizhzhia region as fierce fighting continues there and in the eastern Donetsk region. 

“Ukrainian Defense forces continue the defense operation in the Bakhmut direction. Our soldiers are advancing, the enemy is losing ground on the flanks,” Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian Land Forces, said Tuesday. 

Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian troops have made advances in three directions in the past day: “In the Bakhmut direction in the area of Berkhivka reservoir - by 250 meters (about .2 miles); in the Toretsk direction - by 200 meters (about .1 mile); and in the Berdiansk direction, it now controls 3 square kilometers (about 1.2 square miles).”

“The enemy is doing everything to hold the positions it has captured. It is actively using attack and army aircraft, and is conducting intense artillery fire. During the offensive, our troops face continuous minefields combined with anti-tank ditches. All of this is combined with constant counterattacks by enemy units on armored vehicles and the massive use of ATGMs (anti-tank guided missiles) and kamikaze drones,” she said Tuesday.

Fighting between Russian and Ukrainian armed forces is ongoing near the contested village of Makarivka, which is reported to have changed hands several times now. Ukrainian officials say fighting is happening Tuesday in the villages of Mala Tokmachka, Novodanylivka, Mariinka, Yahidne and Vesele.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-13-23/index.html

""The Russian Ministry of Defense on Tuesday claimed to have repelled Ukrainian attacks near the southern Donetsk villages of Rivnopil, Makarivka and Prechystivka. 

The villages are close to the border of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, where both Russia and Ukraine have reported clashes. 

“Over the past 24 hours, the Ukrainian troops continued to attempt to carry out an offensive in South Donetsk direction,” according to the Russian ministry's daily briefing on Tuesday.

“Three attacks by Ukrainian units reinforced with tanks and armored fighting vehicles were repelled in the area of Makarivka,” it said.

The contested village is reported to have changed hands several times.

Two attacks near Rivnopil and another attack near Prechystivka were also repelled, the Russian ministry said.

CNN cannot independently verify battlefield reports.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say fighting is happening Tuesday in the regions' villages of Mala Tokmachka, Novodanylivka, Mariinka, Yahidne and Vesele. 

Deputy Defense Minister of Ukraine Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian troops have made advances in three directions in the past day.""",False,1686668513.0,t3_1485xrd,t3_1485xrd,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

Today, the hangars of many countries are filled with modern military equipment that is covered with dust and is not planned to be used. Question. If Russia is the main strategic doctrinal threat to Europe and the war with Russia is going on in Ukraine today... why do you need so many weapons right now? With whom else do you plan to fight on this continent in the 21st century?

Every single attempt at negotiations failed.

(1)

For one, they’ve are now sending cadets (from the numerous military academies).

(2) 

Regarding mobilized ^1, the ages have recently broadened for those subject to the at-large mobilization.  The age is extended to something rather late, like 48yo.  It also now includes those with criminal records—something inconceivable several years back.  It should be noted that the older men mobilized—there’s a host of exemptions, including importance of your employment, medical issues, family dependents. 

The mode of informing who has been mobilized is now non-confrontational.  There’s no in-person delivery of summons, thus hiding out at the dacha is pointless.  Now, it’s posted to a government website, and if fail to show, the police, rosgvardia, fsb track you down.  Absconders are charges, they receive 4-7 years. 

(3)

For the *young* conscripts^1 , which is *supposed* to not be permitted to be “sent abroad,” but were *initially* sent to Ukraine (due to Shoigu not telling the regional generals that were actually invading, and then too complicated to suddenly pluck out thousands and would’ve been obvious in those hours prior); but when those young conscripts ended up getting killed, it caused an uproar in RF and were largely taken out of Ukraine...last summer.  But—one of the reasons for the swift fake-annexation—those war zones were no longer “abroad.”  Annexation meant that those are considered  “new Russian territories” and can be deployed to a war zone now because that is now “part of Russia.”

(4) 

The age, background, physical requirements for “volunteers,”^2 has now been expanded, something like accept “volunteers” to sign a contract until age 58.  Seems like up to 65 if have railway or engineering experience.  Those with physical limitations are promised that won’t be front line, rather, will be drivers, mechanics, cooks, etc. 

(5) 

The regional press initially had many stories of local families of fallen soldiers who had countless obstacles in obtaining their promised death benefits, pensions, subsidies.  Russia really ramped up those efforts, so all the regions have multiple offices and the paperwork required and wait time has significantly decreased.  Even the families of prisoners recruited get a payout.  Word has gotten out.  This has kept the families calm.  It also motivates men from impoverished areas to go sign up, bc it apparently makes them feel useful.  That even if die, they still helped family. 

(6)

Those who go to the “new territories” (ie Ukraine, ie warzone) as civilians still end up serving.  I’ve read numerous reports in Russian papers of medical personnel who went “to help,” and ended up have things like “overnight ammunition guard duty”—I mean people like pulmonologists, radiologist, orthopedic surgeons, etc.  This happens to contractors, engineers, etc.

(7) 

The government has recently pressured oligarchs to more visibly support the war.  In the last few weeks, there’s been announcements in the regional press from whoever the local scion is in that areas industry, that they will pay bounties to the men from their respective regions who capture or destroy big-ticket items.  They list the equipment, artillery, Officer ranks, etc and then how much will pay out to the soldiers from their region who successfully eliminate those (Ukrainian officers is dead or capture)—it’s in the millions of rubles, which actually isn’t that much—however, it does motivate men on the lower end of the intelligence scale to volunteer. 

*In conclusion:*

Because of all these changes and efforts, Russia is on track to meet its personnel goal, it says.

In addition we do kind of need them to intercept any Russian military planes that come into our arctic airspace, a somewhat regular occurrence. We've upgraded them over the years but we only have about 60 flyable left, give or take, and they're all we have until the F-35's we ordered start coming in. The Fins have some Hornets too but are in the same situation we are, they need fighters to counter potential Russian incursions into their airspace and are waiting for F-35's. The US Marines are also waiting for their F-35's, they're not going to be giving up their old Hornets without a replacement. Yes the US has a ton of jet fighters but they seem reluctant to supply fighters in general and they will not strip a core air support component from Marine expeditionary forces from them without a substitute.

And I know this puts a damper on the understandable desire to help Ukraine out every single way possible but if Ukraine is already going to be getting a substantial number of F-16's in the near future learning to maintain and fly F-18's as well could be a diversion of the kind of highly skilled manpower that is no doubt already stretched to the limit in Ukraine. Plus we already picked over the Australian F-18 fleet when they decommissioned it and bought the best airframes and a lot of spare parts. So with few operators and a production line that ended 25 years there might not be the spare parts available to fly any F-18's we do give Ukraine for very long.

I don't think giving Ukraine F-18 Hornets gets them operating a western combat aircraft any faster than we could get them up and running with F-16 Falcons. And once they're up and running with Falcons it makes more sense to just give them more when there are so many more of them potentially available for Ukraine, a much more ample supply of spare parts and more people with expertise to help train Ukrainian pilots and maintainers. Giving them Hornets might see Ukraine invest time and manpower learning to fly a platform that runs out of spare parts in a few months when they could have just been flying more Falcons anyway.",False,1686708659.0,t3_1485xrd,t1_jo1ps4x,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

NATO-tanks are so large because they prioritize survivability. All that extra space leaves more room for enemy attacks to be deflected. It does make them easier to spot however.

The US military was doing a tech demonstration for different drones to clear anti-personnel minefields, and one of the entries was a caterpillar-like robot that had lots of legs. The robot would just wander through the minefield, and if it stepped on a mine, a couple of legs would get blown off, but it could keep moving. After a while, the robot had all but one of its legs blown off, and was still dragging itself across the ground... and the ~~Marine~~ Army colonel running the demo forced them to stop, because he couldn't stand the sight of this poor damaged robot dragging itself through the minefield.

Ukrainians have taken up positions in the mix of ruins and residential areas, in any advantageous firing position.

c9f518c0620797dc9e2ab2daeb70f6c6,1485xrd,jnzfyhx,"So, if you were a modern military with capable commanders and time to prepare, the Russian lines would be something like the below: 

First lines are the grey zone,  areas that have been under constant shelling throughout,  Shallow trenches and hand dug fortifications normally in the tree lines.  anti vehicle Minefields possibly seeded by artillery across the open fields and some by hand on expected vehicle routes.  The villages, mostly shells of houses  are generally small logistics hubs for these mostly infantry held positions.  

First line of defense around  5-10 kms back will be larger trench works, dug by diggers as well as by hand,  larger fortification and logisitcs ""hubs"" built inside the trench networks, reinforced with possibly concrete pillboxes and well sandbagged and shored up. These defences will be up to 2kms deep. The trench lines will be well built and zigzagged going parallel to the expected attack line with offshoots back towards the defensive lines as well, allowing resupply and to create confusion and firing positions if Infantry do manage to breach them (also reduces effectiveness of artillery hits on the trench). 

Lines of fire will have been cleared around gun/RPG emplacements,  artillery will be presighted on expected lines of advance and placed 10 - 30 kms back (likely most of them will be closer than this) .  Trees will have been felled and anti tank ditches and other things like dragon's teeth and barbed wire put in place.  They will make use of natural defensive features to secure flanks. These will be backed up with fighting positions for vehicles that can also be used as troop transport in case of a fighting withdrawal.  Built well the defense networks should offer a lot less protection to the army attacking if they are successful in breaching these defences. 

The Second line of defense will be a better prepared version of the first somewhere a few kms behind the first, in between will be mostly empty fields and prepped for ""mobile defense"".  If the first line is breached it will allow the defenders to retreat to the second and then organise counterattacks on the exposed flanks of the attacking force when they look to cross this mobile defense line.  The attacking force will be under constant artillery bombardment firing from a range too deep for effective counter artillery fire. There will be barriers to create choke points all through these lines. 

The area between the two lines in Russian doctrine is thought of almost as a killzone.  This area is for mobile defense.  They will bring mechanised reserves to the area as quick as they can and you are most  likely to see the vaunted tank on tank and Bradley on tank action at this point in the war.  The Russians will be most likely to risk their planes and helicopters in CAS (Close air support) missions in this zone.  It's effectively the best area for defense of all as long as the fighting withdrawal from the first line has been organised and not a rout.... This area is one where individual regiments in Russian doctrine are given some autonomy to counter attack (manoeuvre defence) where they see fit.  I could see this having been effective two years ago but now with poorly trained troops making up large numbers of the regiments it is unlikely they will be trusted with such battlefield decision making (probably rightly so) 

Third line is generally the reserve in well protected and hidden positions with a few fall back positions, if the second line is breached I don't expect the third to hold, if the second is breached I am pretty sure the entire reserve will have already been committed.   Unfortunately there is almost no way Ukraine gets across the second line without very very high losses of manpower and equipment

Doing all of this without air superiority is a Herculean task.  The air superiority that Western armies would expect would mean a constant bombardment of defending ground troops and vehicles but more importantly the artillery 20 - 30 km back would be destroyed pretty quick and the defending army has no CAS.  Ukraine are having to rely on the precision rocket systems and will probably have Western Anti air systems pulled as close to the front as they dare to cover this assault - probably IRIS - T Possibly backed up by Gepard for the drones and loitering munitions.  Together this will have to do a similar job, hopefully it will be as effective as I expect. 

The biggest thing for the Russians in holding these defensive lines is cohesion between defending units and command and control.  The reason I am optimistic in light of the seemingly overwhelming odds is threefold. 

1.  Ukraine have been superb at cutting the head off the snake and leaving Russian troops without clear orders.  Without the NCO structure and without the trust in subordinates to make effective battlefield decisions this will leave weaknesses in the lines between units and once Ukraine finds one they will exploit it quickly. 
2. The regiments defending these lines are not at full strength and are not stocked with well trained troops, Mobilised soldiers make up large portions of even the elite VDV units (who should be the reserve troops but have been fighting front line duties in a number of areas already) 
3. The mobile long range scoot and shoot artillery systems Ukraine now has will be able to supply a lot of precise covering fire",False,1686656133.0,t3_1485xrd,t1_jnz98r8,,2,46,0,46,0,0,

Secondly, a war of attrition means more Ukrainain soldiers killed. Equipment supply from NATO might vastly outnumber Russian equipment, but trained manpower is not infinite. As it is, the war has grinded through so much Ukraine trained manpower that it necessitates training more new manpower. Older units around since the war start has had 50% to 100% turnover.

Russia has none of this: their junior officer core is a joke and their NCOs are basically there to keep the scum in line.

I don't need evidence when I am speculating something, because I'm not claiming that this is what is occurring, but I'm commenting that it's a possibility. Nothing in my comment claims any evidence that isn't readily publicly available. My thoughts are that Ukraine may be inflicting mission kills. That means that Ukraine is shooting down missiles so they don't hit their intended target, which is a documented possibility, and I am wondering if this is what is happening on a technical level. I think morally it makes a great deal of sense for Ukraine to shoot down missiles even if they hit apartments because I assume they do so protecting much more important things. 

I think people here are being a bit overzealous by adding a moral tone to my comment which was an analytical question. When I say direct or indirect, I am not speaking of who is to blame morally, I literally just mean did Russia mean to hit this apartment building or was a missile shot down into it? And my speculation is that it's possible for it to be the later, because 1.

First, the US and Russian militaries were staying well separated in order to avoid direct conflict, and the US in particular was trying to avoid engagements for political reasons. Second, Russia was using Wagner for a lot of frontline ops specifically for plausible deniability, so they could be aggressive without being too obvious about it. And third, the specific oil refinery in question had recently been liberated by Kurdish troops with US backing. So Wagner thought they were going to be fighting locals, not the US directly.

Possibly they saw just a few US troops in the area and didn't expect to engage them. It was clear that the US didn't have many troops actually on the ground there. However, when Wagner began to advance, the US did have a ton of mostly idle air power available. Ready to escalate if necessary to defend themselves. And Russia had orders to avoid engaging the US themselves. So Russia immediately disavowed Wagner, and the US deployed severe overkill in air power terms just to make a point. Get their pilots some combat experience, defend their handful on the ground because what else would they be there for.

Wagner really wasn't intending to take on the USAF at all. Mostly it reads like Russia was using Wagner to advance, and planned in advance to abandon them if a major problem cropped up. And while I don't know this for sure, I suspect that Wagner mistook the US's general unwillingness to engage as a sign of weakness instead of a political stance of minimizing involvement.

Firstly, in the short term, manpower and equipment are limited. Ukraine and NATO took months to train and supply the current troops with weapons. The issue is not the amount of supplies or manpower Ukraine can get, the issue is with the rate at which these can be generated. Once troops need to rest and equipment needs to be substantially resupplied, then the counteroffensive has to be called off, otherwise attrition rates go up and entire units are destroyed. Ukraine's own planning shows that they are well aware of this and take this into account.

Secondly, history has shown us again and again there is a limit to how long units can keep fighting. If they spend too long on the frontline, even with rotations to rear areas, with time, combat effectiveness is lost, attrition rates drastically go up. This is unnecessary in terms of human cost and should be avoided at all cost. Historically, entire units have been destroyed this way, very complacent to not take this into account. 

Thirdly, it is very complacent to assume that Western support will be there if there are no visible results. Just look at Syria. Western support dropped off once it became a stalemate. Ukraine themselves are well aware of this, that is why Zelenskiy goes around to garner support. He does this to keep Ukraine visible, to keep the war visible. If a stalemate develops it will be very difficult to keep the war visible, the support will drop off. It is very unwise to assume that Western support will be indefinite. That is not how international politics work, Zelenskiy himself is well aware of that.

Also, the faster the battles end, the more manpower and equipment is available for the next counteroffensive, the rearming and resupply period can be shorter.

Also, tactically it is very silly to try to grind down the enemy if faster ways of ending the battle is available. Russia does not have the manpower or equipment to defend the entire frontline, just that they are not weak enough now to allow Ukraine to exploit it.
