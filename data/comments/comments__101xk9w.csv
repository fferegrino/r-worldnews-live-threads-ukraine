Russia recently changed their Subsistence Level calculation. The old one was created in 1992 as the corpse of the Soviet economy was rotting. It's just the cost of food for the month so the person does not starve. In 1992 nearly 50% of Russians were food insecure. The idea was, as soon as the food situation improves the index should be expanded to include things like clothes and shoes and soap, but the economy kept crashing in the 90s. When Putin came to power the number of Russians below the poverty line, e.g. those who are starving, was about 30%.

The oil boom in the 2000s allowed Putin to reduce the number of food insecure Russians to 20%. Instead of including more expenses in the index he kept chasing pretty numbers, so adding shoes and clothes to the index was nixed because it would immediately bump up the poverty level to ~50%. After modest improvements in his first ten years the food insecurity statistics remained static for the last twelve as Russia's economy stagnated. 

The new index is no longer tied to cost of goods but is instead some really complex formula based on weighing wages that even experts struggle to comprehend. The end result is, it shows that the same magical 20% of Russians are food insecure in 2023. No one got poorer, see!

Of course, even the old index was BS. It did not consider families and did not consider children; a family of two adults making minimum wage rated exactly the same as two earners feeding two kids. The statistics also fluctuated wildly region by region. The poorest regions are the exact same ones over-represented in Putin's army: 30% of people in Ingushetia are food insecure. Only 3% of people in Buryatia earn more than $1K a month. 

The living conditions of Russia's poor are as you can imagine abysmal. 36% of Russians live in conditions ""below minimum livable standard"", e.g. less than 60 sq ft per person AND lack one or more basic utilities. 27% more are also missing utilities but have more living space. That is, 63% of people living in Putin's paradise lack electricity, heat, water, or sewage. 

To feed themselves they rely on various government handouts and subsidies. With the sanctions and the wartime economy those will inevitably run out. 

This is the reality behind Putin's propaganda. A third to over half of Russians never saw their living conditions improve since the fall of the Soviet Union 3o years ago. Over half live without basic utilities and a good third can't afford basic food. Keeping them docile requires immense government handouts.",False,1672764502.0,t3_101xk9w,t3_101xk9w,,0,63,0,63,0,0,

^1 ^(Ukrainians, contrastingly, are overly-cautious regarding their soldiers health—pull men out if *might be* injured, requires official clearance from authorized doctor in order to return—this can entail more than just conventional medical care—sometimes it’s psychological care, including “rest.” Obviously, doctors give approval to return if injury doesn’t affect work.

Day 314 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a pretty quiet day, there were no missile or drone strikes here in Kharkiv, but not that long ago, at 11pm, there was a missile strike in Zaporizhzhia. It is reported that civilian infrastructure was the target as usual, which is not surprising. It seems like Russians forgot that military targets exist, but that’s even better for us, they are just wasting their missiles for nothing.

I bet that yesterday’s strike on ice arena in Druzhkivka was their desperate attempt to try and get some kind of a win. They most likely thought that it was used by our forces in the same way they used the school that was levelled in Makiivka, but it was empty. There was nothing inside that could have been seen as a military target, so they ended up just wasting their missiles yet again. 

And at the same time in the past couple of days there were a couple more successful strikes on Russian bases by our forces, with another 100-300 casualties. Also, there was one strike on a warehouse that they were using to store vehicles, which was hit because one of their soldiers was posting videos from there. It’s great that they are providing targeting data for their military targets to our forces without us even asking for it first.

Apparently just now Russian MoD said that the number of casualties in Makiivka rose to 89, it’s unlike them to talk about their losses, but they have to do it in this case because it’s impossible to hide this particular incident. Too many people know about it already, and a lot of them don’t believe in the small number of casualties that is being reported, so they have to say something about it.

2/ The relatives of two mobilised men from Samara region say that a total of four HIMARS missiles hit the building, which they say was occupied by about 400 men at the time. They included soldiers from the 44th and 45th regiments. Some escaped after the first missile hit. 

3/ According to the relative of one of the survivors, ""Many more people [than the claimed 63] were killed. They are still being pulled out from under the rubble."" She suspects that local people gave the location to the Ukrainians: ""They were breathing poison on them there."" 

4/ Some soldiers managed to escape from the building's basement. As previously reported, many of the casualties will need to be identified from DNA records. One survivor says he and his colleagues have been ""cleaning brains off our boots.""

8 weeks into the war, they filmed Jonas Ohman, the founder and CEO of a Lithuanian NGO that supplies non-lethal aid to Ukrainians. He stated maybe 30 pct of the aid reached the front.

In a documentary aired in August CBS used the clip out of context to imply that 30 pct of US MILITARY AID is lost. A tankie from Amnesty then implied it probably went to the black market. CBS took some of their lies down, but continued to lie about the criticism, instead stating that ""we're told things have changed since the original clip"".

>**Russia Is Afraid of Western Psychic Attacks**

>**Pseudoscience and mysticism are common among the Moscow elite.**

>By Lauren Wolfe

>*There are plenty of reasons these days to wonder if Russian President Vladimir Putin and his cronies are off their rockers. But a recently leaked memo from the Kremlin reveals that those in charge of the Russian government are farther down the rabbit hole than most of us realized.*

>*The memo, published by the Insider, a Russian news outlet in exile, outlines how the Russian Federal Guard Service (FSO), which protects high-ranking officials such as Putin, would handle the invasion of Ukraine — or any other war — spilling over onto the country’s own soil. It focuses on psychological preparedness, ensuring that FSO officers would have the “moral and psychological support” needed to resist what the memo calls a potential “massive ideological attack.” But the Russians aren’t simply worried about the usual wartime propaganda, like sneaky radio broadcasts or underground newspapers. Instead, the Kremlin is mounting preparations for what it calls the “psychological infection of personnel” by an enemy who would manipulate them through hypnosis—as well as through unknown mystical and psychic powers. The memo warns of “psi-generators” and “hypnotic abilities” used by foreign personnel...*

Troops are being built into units.  Units of friends who will want to protect each other under fire.  There is a very important difference here and it's the first rule of military training:  troops in battle do not rush bravely into battle because they are ""trained"" to follow orders. But they do amazing ""do or die"" things to protect their buddies.   This level of bonding has well known procedures. It just takes time.  

Second thing... every soldier is, in the end, infantry... either that or incapacitated.   When the radio conks out, or the gas is empty, when the tank is hit, after ejecting from a plane, when caught encircled... regardless of your ""specialty""... it doesn't matter. In the end you're on the ground, you're using a rifle.   But you can't really tell that to folks who don't want to be infantry too early.  You first need to tell them that they are going to be posted in a nice safe warm position, well out of range.  So that they (and their buddies they will ultimately fight to the death to defend) don't turn on you and fight you, rather than face Ukraine's armed forces. 

Third:  artillery is about as rear as you can get and still be in the game.  

Presto: if you are Russia and you need to throw a crapton of meat at Ukraine's army in order to deplete them of shells and bullets, you ""train"" units to be artillery.  Which keeps them comfy during the weeks of unit-forming. And only then, when it's too late, do you dump 'em on the front as the infantry you planned for them to be.",False,1672764040.0,t3_101xk9w,t1_j2s7tn2,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

We all know what happens when a few dozen drunk hooligans start something at a football match and the rest of the crowd follows along.  Now imagine them armed with military weapons.   Multiply this by a few hundred.  This is the RuAF conscript reality at the moment. 

Russia needs to break 'em up to keep it from getting out of control, but they also need them in large enough groups that they can make a difference on the front, and it's pissing wet and cold outside.  

Russia also needs to make sure they have no clue when they're about to be dumped on the front line.  Because if they find out too soon before they get there, someone is going to have done the math and realize their chances of survival are astronomically higher if they fight their commanding officers before having to fight Ukraine's army. 

They can't be bivouacked too far from the front line.  You have to get them used to piling into vehicles, driving a short distance, and coming back alive before you can get them willingly piling in for that last and most purposeful ride to the front.  If that last ride is too long, they may figure it out enroute and they may cut and run as soon as they are fully armed.

So... where do you put them?

People whisper to each other in the dark.  Form communities. It's part of what you want to happen.  But that carries the risk that they are hostile communities.  

If you are a Russian officer, you are at least going to want a good night's sleep.   It's cold and wet outside. Tents in this weather are miserable. You need buildings. Buildings that are easy to guard, and easy to control with a small number of loyal folks who are as afraid for their skins as you are of yours.  You need institutional buildings, with corridors you can guard and doors you can lock. 

There are only so many of these places still standing near the front lines. And Ukraine knows where all of them are.

The tech is nowhere near there. We can't even get ""full self driving"" cars after years of dedicated R&D by huge teams, and that's a far easier problem: stay on the ground, stay between the lines, follow a predetermined static path, avoid obstacles. The law of diminishing returns continues to plague self-driving vehicles, and it's even more of a factor if we're talking about off-road or flying vehicles using image recognition to destroy, not avoid targets.

Just like self-driving cars, these combat robots can probably get to 'almost there' fairly quickly. But on a complex mixed battlefield like Ukraine it's a recipe for disaster.

The end of combat will not end the flow of weapons/munitions won't stop (because Ukraine needs a well equipped standing army).  Ukraine will now be a de-facto NATO standard equipment tester in the near term and will need to be a user in the long term.  So the MIC based economic reason to prolong the war is just not there.  They're making bank either way.

Economically, sanctions won't be lifted immediately at the end of conflict.  Russia is fucked either way.

But while the war continues, we risk several things:

1. Energy crisis in Europe (winter cold snap)
2. Humanitarian crisis in Ukraine (cold snap + infrastructure damage)
3. US elections resulting in culling of support
4. Fertilizer supply crunch
5. Neon/Silicon supply crunch
6. Wheat/food supply crunch (mostly impacts the middle east)

Finish this up, crush and humiliate Russia, force a full withdrawal, then negotiated ceasefire + economic lifeline to avoid total collapse.  As European leaders have said, paradoxically, the best way to end the war quickly is to *increase support to Ukraine*.

I am convinced if the West is not providing something, there's a logistical, intel or risk based reason for it.  ATACMS and Abrams probably come down to logistics; other advanced stuff probably comes down to intel/risk.  The rest is training, and for all we know that's happening on the quiet.  They're not gonna advertise it.

I really don't think they're worried about red lines or nukes.  Ukraine isn't going to cross into Russia.  They just want their shit back, including Crimea.  Russia overstepped here and needs to come out behind, not ahead or break even.  Russia has already shown Crimea can be attacked without nuclear reprisal.  It's a bad showing.

The closest thing to a stalemate this might become is cross-border shelling/drones/PGM, once Russia gets pushed back.   Really, Crimea is the only open question, that'll be more like a siege than an assault.  All those built up defensive emplacements in Donetsk and Luhansk are just HIMARS training dummies.",1672764916.0,1672761017.0,t3_101xk9w,t1_j2s05ea,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

I mean even western media give far too much oxygen to Russian claims but I've found Indian stuff to be further in that direction.

Both blow my mind when we consider how often Russian officials and media lies, and easily demonstrably so.

Just one example off the top of my head was a series of stuff from western outlets about the strikes in Makiivka. They only quoted Russian claims for casualty numbers, which is just complete crap given their consistent lies for casualties and equipment losses (even compared to visual confirmations). And we have some unconfirmed accounts from those on the ground or linked to people there that claim at least 200-300 dead, or at least in the building at the time.

A good rule of thumb is if you read Russian statements, cross reference with other sources. Or just assume it's far more likely to be a lie than the truth.

Don't get me wrong, Ukraine has made some questionable statements but they are far more likely to be truthful.

It makes sense when you understand the intent behind these things. Russia wants to downplay casualties and has institutional issues with the truth. Ukraine is trying to be a modern, factual and honest European nation. Any lie Ukraine tells sets them back in this goal, so they will just generally not say something rather than flat out lie. Whereas Russian outlets are primarily trying to control information and shape support in Russia.

The western media is just guilty of trying to portray 'both sides' - not accounting for the fact that one side can be 90+% wrong, and the other 90+% right.

Many folks then get caught up in what I call 'averaged truth' (IDK what it's official term is) but it's where you take two accounts and pick a rough middle point as the 'probable facts'.

Which is of course pure bs... One party can be 100% truthful and the other 100% fabrication.

Best option - digest a range of news sources and cross reference the facts. Eventually you'll find the more reputable organisations and so can rely more on them.

Also good to keep an eye on replies in these threads as many worldnews vets constantly do fact checking and cross-referencing to try and find the truth.

Last summer, the headquarters of a tank battalion in Horlivka was smashed to rubble by a similar flight [of missiles].

It ended with them shooting randomly in all directions, abandoning their vehicles,running every which way and not putting up a coherent ambush response. It was clear they didn't have any urban combat training and they weren't expecting to be shot at.

Additionally, they don’t really have the ability to produce modern weapons at scale, so even if they throw bodies at problems, those bodies will be slaughtered by better armed and fortified Ukrainians.

There also in a demographic meltdown.  Incredibly low birth rate, their population structure is weighted towards older demographics.  Meaning they have a much more limited young/fighting age population then they would admit.  Every death is exponentially worse because of this.  It will make the demographic issues worse, and hue their economy.

They also have had massive immigration of people fleeing from that younger demographic, many of them in highly skilled and hard to replace fields.

The land where this Slav population lived become known as Rus'.

The ruler of one such early Rus' states, marched south to the Kiev, and conquered it, which created a state that later came to dominate the other princes, thus its ruler became known as ""The Grand Prince of Kiev"". We call that state Kievan Rus' today, and the dynasty that ruled it Rurikids, after its legendary founder Rurik (who was a Norse chief according to the legend).

&nbsp;

That state existed for some time, until it disintegrated in the 12th century, into squabbling princedoms once more.

One such princedom was Vladimir-Suzdal with the capital in Vladimir. In 1169 its ruler, Prince Andrey Bogolyubskiy, a Rurikid, son of the Grand Price of Kiev, sacked Kiev, at which point Vladimir become the most important city and principality.

And then the Mongols came, and done some remodeling. Vladimir was destroyed and the prince killed. Principality of Vladimir disintegrated into many statelets ruled by petty princes, who fought for supremacy, while being vassals of the Golden Horde.

&nbsp;

Not all parts of the former Kievan Rus were in a similar situation, however. In the west, Principality of Galicia–Volhynia was largely spared the Mongol rule, with its prince submitting to the Mongols only nominally, while in reality, putting up a resistance.

In order to gain support, the Principality turned to the West, including with the Pope. In 1253, Daniel I, a Rurikid, was crowned by the Pope as King of Ruthenia, and his state become what is now known as Kingdom of Ruthenia — Ruthenia being the western evolution of Rus'.

In 1277, the capital of the kingdom was moved to... Lviv.

[Also, check out the colors on the kingdom's coat of arms!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia#/media/File:Alex_K_Halych-Volhynia.svg)

Do they remind you of something?

In 1323, the Rurikid dynasty died out in the kingdom, and there was a conflict about inheriting it, eventually won by Poland's king, Casimir III. Since then, it was part of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

&nbsp;

While all of that was happening, a tiny principality of Moscow, grew in size by eating other post-Vladimir princes. Eventually, prince Yuri entered a close relationship with the Mongols, by marrying the khan's sister. From that point on, Moscow was an enforcer of the Mongols, beating up other Rus' people to get them to pay up to the khan.

That was a very beneficial position, which allowed Moscow to, in the name of the Mongols, take over Vladimir, Novgorod and become a massive duchy — Grand Duchy of Moscow.

When the Golden Horde became attacked by Tamerlane, its power started to wane, allowing Moscow to became more independent.

Finally, with the conquering of large part of Rus', and after the final defeat of the Mongol remnant in 1480, Ivan the Terrible was in 1547 declared Tsar of Russia — ""Russia"" being the eastern evolution of ""Rus'"". In 1598, his son Feodor I died, ending that branch of Rurikids, and the house as well.

&nbsp;

In the meantime, the Wild Fields were populated by Rus' people, who could not give a fuck about any of that. They were living on their own, without kings or tsars, embracing many aspects of their lifestyle from the Mongols. They were the Cossacks.

One group of them, Zaporozhian Cossacks, had enough of the Polish attempts at subduing them, including their Orthodox religion. They had rebelled and kick the Poles out.

[Here is their leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky entering Kiev, the old capital of Keivan Rus' as the savior.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Pic_I_V_Ivasiuk_Mykola_Bohdan_Khmelnytskys_Entry_to_Kyiv.jpg)

Note the religious leaders grateful for the protection of the Rus' people's religion from the evil Catholics.

The result of the victory was the creation of the Cossack Hetmanate.

[Here is its coat of arms, and please notice the colors it is using.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohdan_Khmelnytsky#/media/File:Herb_Viyska_Zaporozkoho.svg)

[As a way of dealing with the uprising, the Polish elites had proposed turning the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into a Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth. Here is how it would look like.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Hadiach#/media/File:Rzeczpospolita_Trojga_Narod%C3%B3w_w_roku_1658.png) Notice that Rus', whoops... I mean Ruthenia would have the capital in Kiev.

This did not work out because many Ruthenians believed it to be a bad deal.

In order to protect itself from Poland, the Hetmanate entered into a treaty with Russia. Cossacks considered it to be an alliance, but the Tsars considered it to be a vassalage. Fights between Russia and the Hetmanate continued, until Catherine the Great, the one that had her statue in Odessa until just a few days ago, said this in 1775:

> With this we would like to let our Empire and our faithful subjects be known that the Zaporozhian Sich is now destroyed and the name of Zaporozhian Cossacks is to be no more as well, mentioning of whom will be considered no less as an affront to our Imperial Majesty for their deeds and insolence for disobeying the will of our Imperial Majesty.

The army entered the borders, razed what it could, and exiled whoever they wanted. From now on, Ukraine would be under the Russian Empire.

&nbsp;

One interesting thing that was happening back then, was the slow transformation of the identity of the Russian state. It originally claimed to be the successor to Kievan Rus' but as more and more non-Slavic people lived in its ever-expanding borders, it started to look at itself as an Empire — a successor to the Byzantines.

&nbsp;

During the 19th century the people living in the territories of the former Kingdom of Ruthenia and Cossack Hetmanate started to see themselves through the lens of nation.

They were speaking a similar language, different to the Russian one which has undergone a shift away from the original Rus' language thanks to the influence of Church Slavonic, which had its origin in South Slavic. 

They had a shared history, through Kievan Rus', the Mongols, and the expansion of Kingdom of Ruthenia to the east, as it fought for the control of Kiev.

But above all, they had a shared goal of achieving independence.

The term ""Ukrainians"" became commonly used, through a reference to the name of the geographic region they inhabited. The previously used terms: Rus', Rusyns, Ruthenians , all had the problem of being too close to the hated ""Russians"", which was eagerly used by the Russian propaganda.

&nbsp;

Ukraine has finally got its independence in 1991, after a lot of events that fall outside our scope here. Its internationally recognized borders contain: Kiev, the capital of Kievan Rus', where Oleg is supposed to had founded that state; Lviv, the capital of Ruthenian Kingdom, from which Kings of Rus' used to rule; and Crimea, where according to one version, the baptism of Vladimir the Great had occurred, bringing Christianity, and Byzantine influences to Kiev.

Inside the internationally recognized borders of Russia, we have: Novgorod, the city where the legendary Rurik is supposed to had lived, and from where Oleg moved to Kiev; Vladimir, the capital of that guy that took part in the collapse of Kievan Rus' by sacking its capital; and Moscow, which was but a tiny town by the time Kievan Rus's was collapsing, and which later become the seat of the Mongol tax collectors.

I am jesting here, but I hope you see the point here. Is Russia the same state as Kievan Rus'? That is ridiculous. It has a tradition going back there — but so does Ukraine, or for that matter, Belarus.

Ukraine is also located on its former core territories, while Russia consists almost entirely of territories that have nothing to do with Rus'. And the territories it does own, are distant borderlands, that were not even settled by Rus' at the time when Kievan Rus' was founded; and Novgorod, which was destroyed together with its democratic system by the guy who was the first ""Tsar of Russia"". Pitiful.

You talk about Rurikids, but that dynasty ended with the son of the founder of Russia, which precipitated a massive crisis where the crown was passed around like a box of candies. And Kingdom of Ruthenia was also ruled by Rurikids.

Further, the culture of Russia underwent a massive development away from the Rus' one. First, as the result of the Mongols, whose presence was stronger in the east, while in the west Kingdom of Ruthenia could be formed. Then, under princes that became Mongol loyalists, thus adopting a lot of the Horde's political culture. Then under absolute Emperors who done with the populace as they saw fit. And I have already mentioned the language.

Once again, I am not saying that it is Ukraine that is Kievan Rus'. They have also underwent a looong journey. Some of it is even the same, like the influence from the Mongols. But if you want to be stubborn, and insist that Kevan Rus' still exists — be careful, because both Ukraine and Belarus have their own arguments, and they are not weaker than the Russian one.

The strategy is to delay, and it is exactly what any military commander would also try to do in such a situation. The longer the war drags on, the bigger the chances are that Western support eventually dies down. Russia is hoping that Western voters will lose the stomach for paychecks to Ukraine, and they are hoping that Western military commanders will decide that stockpiles of Western weapons are getting too low and will halt resupply on their own.

Neither of these outcomes are out of the question. It is also quite possible that this gamble won't pay off for Russia, but that doesn't undercut the possibility that it also will pay off.

Is it the *best* strategy? Absolutely not, because Putin is an egomaniac. He should be trying to liberalize Russia and de-escalate the war, but he won't. That does not, however, make the limited variety of choices Russian military commanders have available all equally shitty. Some strategies are less shitty than others. Because they have several hundred thousand bodies available to throw into Bakhmut, and because they don't happen to care what happens to those men, putting pressure on Ukraine and halting further Ukrainian offensives is probably the least-bad military strategy Russia can do right now.

It seems doubtful that a Russian offensive would succeed in much beyond further delaying tactics for Ukraine getting its land back, but attritional warfare is hard to gauge that far out.

I think the more important fear that Russian propaganda pushes on people is that there are Russians in Ukraine who are being actively genocide by Ukraine, supported by the west. Contrary to what a lot of people think from the outside, most Russians even the pro-Putin Z-zombies don't really care whether Ukraine belongs to Russia or not - if that was the case, Russian propaganda would be pushing that angle, of restoring USSR borders. But they don't, and actually they largely try to avoid that take because they don't want this to be perceived as imperialism.

Putins whole thing that he sells to the Russian nation is this idea that the west was responsible for colonialism of the old world and Africa, and that they never stopped. He makes everyone terrified that the decadent west is desperately trying to corrupt everyone, to purge non-western cultures, to purge all traditional ways of life. Young urban Russians all know this is bullshit because we have seen the west, a lot of them travelled there, we've had the internet, and it's obvious that it's all lies. But Putin only needs around half the country to vote for him, some meddling ensures his regime while giving people the illusion of choice, and meanwhile he champions himself as the honorable defender. 

I don't say this to justify or excuse this behavior of course. But if you consider the typical Russian, who has no idea about anything in the world except what a competent and consistent propaganda machine has been feeding them for at least 20 years, it's not hard to see how a vast majority believe they have a righteous cause right now. I mean, imagine Fox News was actually incredibly competent, and since 9/11 Americans had no other media to watch, little to no access to any other news sources, and a leader who appears strong and confident. 

The only thing that will fix this is if Russia is forced to face their sins the same way Germany was post-WW2. Even then, many Germans who were older in the post war days didn't even change their thinking, they just kept it quiet. I'd still take that over what we have now.

Obviously with nukes it's not possible to occupy Russia, but I think any peace deal with us should, in addition to regime change, actually force us to show and broadcast evidence of Russian war crimes on Russian TV. Play videos of Bucha, mariupol, everything, for like 72 hours straight on the main channels. Many might still reject it as fake news, but it will hopefully begin to establish a taboo around this way of thinking, so that future generations at least might grow up uncorrected by it.

Sorry for the long post, but I think it's important to for people to try and understand the enemy as well as possible, and hopefully I helped a bit.",1672780679.0,1672780487.0,t3_101xk9w,t1_j2szht9,,4,11,0,11,0,0,

Hence words often have multiple and even sometimes contradictory definitions. 
2. I'd say you are going out on limb claiming surety into the mental state of the people targeting a barracks known to be crammed with sleeping soldiers with the intent of wholesale destruction to life. The military utility and even necessity of such an act has nothing to do with the personal feelings of those doing the acts. Most people are unwilling or at least resistant to killing one person they can see in broad daylight. I would suggest being ""cold-blooded"" — unemotionally denying personal feelings  — can even be required to perform much if not more of what happens on the battlefield. I would go as far as to say too much enjoyment of the role is also detrimental to keeping one's eye on the prize.

They all mean roughly the same thing.  A massacre is just a whole bunch all at once in one place.  

The only thing wrong with massacring people is the same things that are also wrong with killing people.  Shooting people one at a time in numerous places does not make killing that same number of people ethical.  

Killing people is the purpose of the missiles.  Also equipment.  A tank massacre is the correct use of the term ""massacre"".

Exchanging fire or ""combat"" can also happen when both sides of a war have competent armies.  It is still an attempt at a massacre but defensive tactics evade that outcome some of the time.  

Effective combat units usually try to maneuver into a position where their opponent cannot effectively defend themselves.  The ability to achieve this is how ""effective officers"" are distinguish from mediocre or poor officers.  

Armies try to equip themselves with weapons that the enemy cannot defend against.  Armor is the inverse.  Armies expect to get massacred if they do not have either armor or stealth.

Words in English are defined by how they are used, not used as how they are defined. The Oxford English Dictionary, the largest effort made towards codifying the English language, is a generation-spanning effort to write down this usage by bringing together the independent efforts of thousands of scholars attempting to nail down individual attempts at defining meaning. It represents a Herculean decentralized effort. It's a really interesting story. 

The dictionary definitions have meaning, of course. It isn't either-or, right or wrong. But you can't hold up the definition as proof a word does not apply because the circumstance does not fit every aspect of the definition, either.

I, for example, am focusing on the ""without emotion or pity"" part of the definition, with a later nod to the word ""callous"". We don't need to be ""deliberately cruel"" for the word to fit. I think that I made my case why this applies to this event, and even to much of warfare in general. 

To further my point I'd say many cultures throughout history have had an honor prohibition against killing a sleeping enemy. To be clear, I'm not arguing the ethics here in any way. It was a good hit and necessary. I'm just giving a reason a soldier could reasonably think twice about doing what is necessary in a situation like this. Which is exactly why training, and being dispassionate — ""cold-blooded"" — is important. 

---

Your other definition, of ""massacre"" is a bit different, because this word is often used outside its most literal definition to add color to a conversation. What we are left with is that there is undeniably a lot of killing going on, but the specifics are more hazy if we define the word by how it is actually used.  This is much like the drift we see in ""decimated"" no longer meaning ""to reduce (by killing) one-tenth"". Now it means a vague but stronger wholesale destruction. 

Words are often used outside their specific definitions. Case in point my use of ""wholesale"" above. No actual sales are involved, but the image of a bulk purchase conveys the correct message.

At this point numerous interviews with Zelensky and Zaluzhny in December. Here's one from [Dec 15:](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-military-russia-wants-prolonged-war-ukraine-2022-12-15/)

>General Valery Zaluzhny, commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, told the Economist magazine that Russian forces were doing all they could to prevent Kyiv from striking back.

>""This is why you are seeing battles along the 1,500 km frontline ... they are constraining our troops in order not to allow us to regroup,"" the magazine cited him as saying in an interview published on Thursday.

>""The next problem that we have is, first of all, to hold this line and not lose any more ground. It's crucial ... Our troops are all tied up in battles now, they are bleeding.""

This is also paired with Russia's war on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. They are trying to tie up Ukrainian resources and make a longer war more difficult for Ukraine. If they can delay the AFU from further counter-offensives, then Russia hopes that they get the West to the bargaining table.

The harder the war becomes for Ukraine, and the more expensive it is for the West, the higher the chances are that Russia can keep at least some of the territory they have captured in a peace deal. The soldiers Russia is wasting on Bakhmut mean nothing compared to those political goals. Reinforcements can't last forever, but if they can last for a year or so, that's honestly not that terrible of a gamble on Russia's part.

>We will hear ""Zaporizhye was going to collapse"" and ""Crimea was going to collapse' pretty soon.

No we won't. The supply situation in Kherson was always tenuous as soon as Ukraine opened up with HIMARS on the two bridges that supply Kherson. There are no other comparable situations on the front line. That *may* change if Ukraine reconquers southern Ukraine and can isolate Crimea, but that will never apply to the rest of the front.

>Manpower is not infinite. If you intend to delay, you don't throw it away.

That entirely depends on the time table that you are shooting for. For Russia, they are banking on Western support diminishing within the next year. Their manpower will easily withstand that length of attrition.

>And yes - it also wastes ammo, clothing, fuel, medical services, etc etc.

These are not such scarce commodities that this will impact their overall warfighting ability in a worse way than it would to allow Ukraine to launch another grand counter-offensive. Russia needs the captured land a lot more than it needs these small arms and medical supplies. The land can be used as a bargaining chip at a future time to save face in a negotiation; these supplies can't.

Correct. But they have the option of using side streets and main roads from the east that they did not have for Kherson City. Kherson City's fall was so predetermined that Russia withdrew from the entire area before Ukraine's forces were even 5 kilometers away from the city outskirts. That's a huge departure from how they defended Izyum, Kupiansk, Lyman, and now Svatove and Kremina. They aren't withdrawing from those places until they are nearly surrounded because their supply situation is much better.
