>	Baykar has been informed that a crowdfunding campaign dubbed ""The People's Bayraktar"" was successful in raising funds to buy several Bayraktar TB2 UAVs for Ukrainians to use in defense of their Homeland.

>	Business leaders and ordinary people alike contributed funds - small and large - to reach this milestone within a matter of a few days' time.

>	Baykar will not accept payment for the TB2s, and will send 3 UAVs free of charge to the Ukrainian war front. We ask that raised funds be remitted instead to the struggling people of Ukraine. We are touched by their solidarity and resolve in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

>	Baykar prays for a just resolution and lasting peace.

The US plans to announce as soon as this week that it has purchased an advanced, medium-to-long range surface-to-air missile defense system for Ukraine.

A source familiar with the announcement has told CNN about this, Ukrinform reports.

U.S. President Joe Biden announced recently that the U.S. would provide Ukraine with ""more advanced rocket systems and munitions.""

In response to requests by Ukrainian forces, other military assistance is also likely to be announced this week, including additional artillery ammunition and counter-battery radars. Ukrainian officials have asked for the missile defense system, known as a NASAMS system, given the weapons can hit targets more than 160 km away, though the Ukrainian forces will likely need to be trained on the systems, a source said.

The US has been steadily announcing additional security assistance for Ukraine. Last week, the Biden administration announced an additional $450 million in military assistance for Ukraine, giving it four more multiple launch rocket systems and artillery ammunition for other systems.

By Deborah Haynes, security and defence editor

NATO will significantly increase the number of forces on high alert to well over 300,000 from 40,000 as part of the biggest overhaul of the alliance's defences since the Cold War.

Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, also confirmed that allies will expand troop deployments in NATO countries that sit closest to Russia.

The decisions will be set out at a landmark summit of the 30-member NATO alliance this week in Madrid, which is taking place in the shadow of Russia's war in Ukraine.

""We will transform the NATO response force and increase the number of our high readiness forces to well over 300,000,"" Mr Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday in a briefing, previewing the three-day summit.

The NATO Response Force is currently around 40,000 soldiers, sailors and air personnel.

Day 124 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today outside of the usual missile strike we were also shelled during the day. They shelled Northern Saltivka again, this time killing 5 people and injuring over 20 more. They shelled some random street with no military targets anywhere nearby; killing civilians is all they know how to do.

As the dreaded 11pm came, the missiles from Belgorod were launched again, today they fired at least 6 of them, but it sounded like more. Apparently they hit yet another school, that’s 2 days in a row now, yesterday the missile landed right in the middle of the courtyard of a school, it left a big crater and shattered all windows, but it doesn’t look like the building itself was damaged much. They must be really scared of education.

It’s absolutely horrific that Russians hit that mall in Kremenchuck with missiles today. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, so they can’t even deny that they were targeting that mall. After all, they always say how they only use “precision strike munitions” meaning they always mean to hit whatever is hit. What do they want to achieve by indiscriminately killing civilians? Do they get satisfaction from being hated by everyone?

What is even worse is how regular Russians respond to the news about that mall being bombed. They are happy about it; they want more Ukrainians to be killed. They also say that they didn’t do it, that “it’s another fake like Bucha.” They are seriously saying that we didn’t do it, but even if we did they deserved it.

👉 In the north near Kharkiv the war remains a stalemate.

👉 In the previous week russia captured Severodonetsk as Ukrainian forces withdrew to Lysychansk.  While Lysychansk is strategic high ground, recent russian gains around the city have left it in a precarious position and russia is pressing into the city itself with urban street battles reported. 

👉 In the south around Kherson, there was news that russia had withdrawn almost all of its troops from Mariupol and sent them to re-enforce the contact lines around Kherson and engaged in some counter-attacks.  Ukrainian partisan attacks in occupied south Ukraine continue to ramp up with several high-profile collaborators injured, killed or targeted in the last few days.

No immediate assault on Kherson is expected.  In military parlance, this is called ""shaping the battlefield"".  Ukraine is likely waiting for more western heavy weapons to arrive before committing its troops. 

👉 To acknowledge the g7 meeting that putin was not invited to, russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv, destroying several high-rise apartments.

👉 Western made HIMARS MLRS missile systems were confirmed to be in Ukraine and several precision strikes have already obliterated russian ammo dumps, command posts -- thrice, and caused heavy damage to Snake Island -- twice.  Additionally the west will announce this week the transfer of  NASAMS anti-missile systems which would be the most technologically advanced system yet provided to Ukraine.

👉 The russian front has greatly expanded as putin appoints [Major General Pavel](https://twitter.com/chootchyface/status/1541047728079130624) to command the special operation forces in the Donbas areas.  General Pavel is expected to quickly become the target of Ukrainian MLRS and memes since he is such an easy target.  The 67 year old General, previously commanded russian forces in Afghanistan.

👉 russia has defaulted on its international bond interest payments.  This will make it more expensive and difficult for russia to borrow money if sanctions are ever lifted.  Since the bonds are now in default, courts can order bond holders to be paid from assets held by sanctions.

👉 Quickly: Belarus is unlikely to enter the war despite recent reports indicating putin is trying to make it so.   Nothing is likely to come of Lithuania blocking sanctioned goods from being transported to Kaliningrad across its territory.

Boris Johnson has praised the ""Dunkirk spirit"" being shown to help get grain out Ukraine, a government source has said.

Last month, reports emerged that a Russian blockade, combined with the shortage of overland shipping routes, meant that significant supplies of grain remained in storage in Ukraine and could not be exported.

The UK has promised funding to repair Ukraine's damaged railways to move grain overland, but Mr Johnson was struck by the ingenuity already being shown in the country.

""One of the things the PM has been struck by is people are talking about all kinds of smaller ways in which things are happening at the moment,"" a government source said.

""Whether it's boats on canals, lorries, railways, he saw a bit of the Dunkirk spirit. You can achieve a lot through small micro movements.

""It's not a substitute for the mass transit of grain as it used to be shipped, but it's not as if all the grains are sitting there about to rot and none of it is getting out.

""What is getting out is increasing week by week and so there are micro solutions as well as an exploration of a big solution.

""That is important as they've all been discussing the world needs it and the more of it that is there, the lower prices go.

""But also because the Ukraine needs the money that it gets for selling that grain, so there's a double hit for the world and Ukraine in not solving it, which is why it's a big priority.""",False,1656353200.0,t3_vlmgm3,t3_vlmgm3,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 27 June 2022
 

- While Russia's main operational focus remains the Sieverodonetsk-Lysychansk pocket, a week of consistently heavy shelling suggests Russia is now trying to regain momentum on the northern Izium axis. Ukrainian forces continue to hold the line in that sector, making good use of forested terrain to assist their defence.



- Over the coming weeks, Russia's campaign will highly likely increasingly rely on echelons of reserve forces. These consist of several distinct components which Russia has almost certainly already started to field.



- Russia's Combat Army Reserve is a recent innovation of part-time but volunteer reservists, which deploy as whole units typically ear-marked for rear area security tasks. The Human Mobilisation Resource is the sizable pool of all veterans who have served in the regular military in the last five years. Russian authorities are likely using volunteers from this category to fill out the third battalions within regular brigades. Despite a continued shortfall in the number of deployable reservists for Ukraine, the Russian leadership likely remains reluctant to order a general mobilisation.

Some Taiwanese holders of Russian Eurobonds have not received interest due on May 27 after a grace period expired on Sunday evening, two sources told Reuters.

President Vladimir Putin signed a decree last Wednesday to launch temporary procedures and give the government 10 days to choose banks to handle payments under a new scheme, suggesting Russia will consider its debt obligations fulfilled when it pays bondholders in roubles.

One of the Taiwanese sources told Reuters that with the two Eurobonds in question there was “no rouble clause attached”.

“The coupon cannot be paid in roubles instead,” the source added.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has addressed the citizens of Belarus, telling them they are being ""drawn into a war"" by Moscow.

Paris will send ""significant quantities"" of armored personnel carriers to Ukraine, announced the French Minister for the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu in an interview published Monday evening June 27. ""To move quickly in areas under enemy fire, armies need armored vehicles,"" he said in an interview with Parisian-Today in France and broadcast on the daily's website. France will therefore “deliver, in significant quantities, transport vehicles of this type, VAB (Armored Forward Vehicles), which are armed”, he adds.

Mr. Lecornu also confirms the sending to Ukraine of six additional Caesar guns, the flagship of French artillery, beyond the twelve already deployed against the Russians. However, he does not give any details on the date scheduled for the dispatch of this additional reinforcement which had been announced by the Head of State Emmanuel Macron on June 16 during his visit to kyiv.

As for the delivery of anti-ship missiles, requested by kyiv to ""open breaches in this maritime blockade imposed by Russia and which deprives many countries of deliveries of cereals and raw materials"", this ""is part of the files examined"" , adds the minister, without giving more details. Since the start of the military offensive launched by Moscow in Ukraine on February 24, Paris has delivered to kyiv, beyond Caesar cannons, Milan anti-tank missiles and even Mistral anti-aircraft missiles.

The Group of Seven rich democracies will commit to a new sanctions package targeting Russia on Tuesday, a senior US official has said.

Major Russian state-owned enterprises will be targeted, as well as hundreds of Russian officials and entities supporting the war.

The measures will limit Russia’s ability to replace the military equipment it has lost in Ukraine, the official said.

Leaders will agree to raise tariffs on Russian imports to their countries.

Some 570 categories of goods will be affected.

The official said the measures are not expected to impact the US supply chain or raise costs for consumers.

G7 countries will also finalise plans to pursue a price cap on Russian oil to curb Moscow's energy revenues.

The details of how the limit would work, as well as its impact on the Russian economy, would be resolved by G7 finance ministers in the coming weeks and months.

The White House has previously said leaders would make an ""unprecedented, long-term security commitment to providing Ukraine with financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support as long as it takes,"" including the timely provision of advanced weapons.

This build up has been discussed since the start of the war, and has been expedited by the brutality of the invasion so far. They don’t want Bucha happening in other parts of Europe. 

NATO is a defensive alliance and military pact, and when member states in Eastern Europe feel threatened (like right now), the alliance needs to reassure them and send forces to the region to support them. Estonia, Lithuania, Poland etc have been asking for more support from NATO because they fear what would happen if Russia attacked them: they worry that they could fall and be massacred before a proper NATO force gets there. Where there is a concern, troops are placed to show strength and to reassure. Much like Finland and Sweden deciding to join NATO, it’s a precautionary measure.

The build up is there to deter Russia, to show we’re not going to just roll over if Putin tries anymore invasions, and to show the world it’s still a united, strong force- which is the opposite of what Putin wants. There was an increase after Crimea, and there’s a much bigger increase now because this has been taken as truly a threat to European peace and stability, and they don’t want to repeat past mistakes. During the Cold War (at it’s height), there were 400,000 troops just from the US alone in Europe, and WW3 didn’t happen. 

This may be something of an “escalation”, and Russia will inevitably start blustering about it as usual, but Russia opened that box in February. We’re moving back to a more Cold War mindset to address the concern- but that doesn’t necessarily mean all out war.

Right now analysts and experts seem more focused on Ukraine itself, supplying them with weapons and keeping NATO united and on guard, rather than a NATO-Russia clash being imminent. Like Alperovitch [here](https://twitter.com/dalperovitch/status/1540421677661786114?s=21&t=VtT8JfKHM_7wqadx6ZAwBA).

SCHLOSS ELMAU, Germany (Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy nations mocked the macho image of their absent adversary Vladimir Putin on Sunday, at a meeting in Germany dominated by the Russian President's invasion of Ukraine.

As the besuited leaders sat down for their first meeting of the three-day G7 summit in the sweltering Bavarian Alps, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked if their jackets should come off - or if they should even disrobe further.

""We all have to show that we're tougher than Putin,"" Johnson said, to laughter from some of his colleagues.

""Bare-chested horseback riding,"" shot back Canada's Justin Trudeau.

""Oh yes,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. ""Horseback riding is the best.""

Putin, who prizes his sporty image, has been pictured shirtless several times in photos released by Russian state media, including one set in which he rode a brown horse while wearing wrap-around sunglasses, a gold chain and army trousers.

The G7 leaders discussed efforts to further isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which has killed thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. Britain, Canada, Japan and the United States announced moves to ban imports of Russian gold. The G7 also includes France, Italy and Germany.

1) The protracted battle of the “Second (Concrete) Stage of the SMO” is gradually ending.

Whether it will end with an operational pause, or will immediately move into the “Battle for the initiative” (“the effective stage” announced by Kadyrov) - I won’t be guessing, but I still expect that this battle will start outside of Donbas.

The current battle is ending with tactical successes of RF AF, but strategically, in general it is unsuccessful since by the 5th month of SMO the group of UAF in Donbas is still not defeated, likewise it was not pushed out of the majority of its positions.

2) The defeat of UAF in the battle for Severodonetsk on one hand, and the failure of the strategic operation to liberate Donbas by RF AF on the other has already lead to the further increase of military supplies for UAF from the “dear western partners” (not mine).

In July-August a lot will be decided after deployment of reserves from both sides. The time is working both against the so-called “Ukraine” and the RF. But against the RF, the time is working harder.

Especially considering how the Russian political authorities seduced by local (and very expensive) successes are critically slowly realising the necessity of putting the country’s economy onto “war rails”.

It's about Ukraine, but it's also about much more than Ukraine. Could the quickest way to make the war **too** painful for Putin to continue maybe not be to attrite Russia's capabilities for the war in Ukraine but to attrite the capabilities they need for any future war against a NATO quality equipped force? The capabilities for the latter are likely to be significantly more complex and difficult to replace under sanctions.

For example, Russia needs complex radar systems in Ukraine but the need for them against a NATO style foe would be 1000x greater due to NATO's overwhelming airpower and dominance in long-range precision guided munitions. They simply couldn't engage in any such conflict without advanced radar guided anti-defence missile systems and electronic warfare equipment. If they start losing them left, right and center in Ukraine they might think twice about the value of continuing the conflict.

It might be a good question to ask on top of looking for pain-points in their current conflict. What can't Russia afford to lose in Ukraine if they intend to fight a larger war in the next decade? What can we give Ukraine to nail those pain-points.",1656323877.0,1656323602.0,t3_vlmgm3,t3_vlmgm3,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

https://www.csis.org/analysis/next-step-us-aid-ukraine-operational-contractors

>The first problem with this plan is time. New systems take months or years for units to assimilate. When a U.S. military unit is set to get new equipment, for example, a new artillery piece, the process takes many months. Personnel need to train on how to maintain the new system, even if they already understand the maintenance basics. Operators need to learn how to use the system. Training time for the different skills can take from weeks to months. Certain specialties in tank units can take up to six months, and similarly long training times occur with other kinds of equipment.

>The supply system needs to set up inventories down to the unit level. Higher echelon maintenance, like depot maintenance, which rebuilds systems in a factory-like environment, needs to be established with specialized tooling and processes. All this takes time, but Ukraine does not have time; it needs the systems to be ready now.

>The second problem is the reported concept of “train the trainers.” Under that approach, a group of personnel get trained and then return to their units to train the actual operators and maintainers. Even in the best of circumstances, it's not a great system since these trainers lack the support of a dedicated schoolhouse and the experience of professional trainers who cover their material year after year. For Ukraine today, this is far from the best of circumstances. In the midst of a conflict, no unit wants to give up its top maintainers and operators to attend a several-week school back in Europe, away from day-to-day combat operations.

>The unfortunate result will likely be parking lots full of idle equipment. These new systems are being rushed to Ukraine but will be sidelined waiting for enough trained operators to take them to the field and trained maintainers to repair them once they have broken down. It will be more embarrassing if Russia can capitalize on this by targeting these holding areas.

>Even if this train-the-trainer concept works, it will take many months for the trainers to be trained and then for them to return to Ukraine and pass the skills on to the actual operators and maintainers. Equipment will be idle while this process plays out.

>The solution is battlefield contractors (or operational contractor support, as the Department of Defense formally refers to the activities). The Department of Defense defines operational contractor support as the “process of planning for and obtaining supplies, services, and construction from commercial sources in support of CCDR [combatant commandant]-directed operations.” Unlike contractors who work on bases or in factories, these contractors go into conflict zones to conduct a wide variety of services from training to maintenance to translation to security. They are attractive in Ukraine for two reasons.

>First, they do not contravene President Biden's direction that U.S. service members will not enter Ukraine. That also avoids a red line that Putin has established.

>Second, there is a long history of contractors providing this sort of support. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, contractors provided thousands of personnel for training and maintenance. (Note: Armed security contractors received most of the attention, but they were few in number and are not at issue here.) For example, in Iraq in 2013 (the first year data is available), there were roughly 7,500 personnel providing maintenance and training services.

>Whenever defense industry provides equipment for foreign customers, it typically sends a contact team to help get the equipment and logistics processes set up. Saudi Arabia, which has acquired large amounts of U.S. military equipment over the years, has had thousands of contractors in country to help maintain and operate the systems.

>Many U.S. companies have long experience providing such support. KBR and Amentum (formerly DynCorp International) are probably the best known of the military service providers, but there are many others.

>If the United States shies away from direct involvement, then Ukraine could structure this support under its own auspices (with the United States providing funding). Thus, Ukraine could set up its own military services company and hire foreigners to work as technicians. The employees would not be combatants and would likely operate in rear echelons to avoid legal problems. (The status of such service providers is complicated under international law.)

>The Russians would undoubtedly complain about “NATO mercenaries” (and not without some justification), but it is unlikely they would take any extreme action. For example, they have not taken action against the “Mozart group” of international combatants fighting for Ukraine. The Russians are hardly in a position to complain too vigorously since they are recruiting Chechens, Syrians, and anyone else who will join their ranks in order to replace their heavy losses.",False,1656361301.0,t3_vlmgm3,t1_idyz7a3,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Not to mention, you know, the language. It's actually really interesting from a linguistic standpoint, since it lacks final obstruent devoicing, unlike most Slavic languages, and actually shares some sound changes like the merger of y and i with South Slavic

(I've been working on a Slavic-inspired conlang, so I've been doing a *lot* of research)

EDIT: Okay, more explanation. Final obstruent devoicing is a fancy word for that thing a *lot* of languages do, where voiced consonants like B and D become devoiced like P and T at the ends of words. So for example, the Polish words chleb (bread) and sklep (shop) both end in a P sound, but when you add an ending like -y (plural), it changes to a B sound in chleby, but not sklepy. Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian are the only two Slavic languages that lack this.

Meanwhile, Slavic languages are mostly split into 3 groups. West is Polish, Czech, and Slovak, East is Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, and South is Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croation, and Slovene. Well in Common Slavic, there were 6 vowels, with <y> being sort of an ""ih"" sound, but it merged with <i> /i/ ""ee"" in South Slavic, Czech, and Ukrainian.

The previous NATO strategy was that if Russia was to attack and invade and NATO country, then NATO would be able to re-take that land in weeks to months.

On seeing what Russia will do to civilians in weeks to months, NATO has decided this outcome would be unacceptable.

Erdogan just wants to look tough for upcoming elections.

He doesn't really expect them to honor the bogus Interpol warrants that no other country will either.

What he is really after is getting arm sanctions dropped that the US imposed after he bought S400 air defense systems from Russia after he was warned there would be consequences if he did so. This has left them unable to upgrade their US F-16's and got them kicked out of the F35 fighter program. Then his military incursions into Iraqi Kurdistan and Syria only pissed the US off even more.

In the coming weeks look for both Sweden and Finland make some vague statements about not supporting Kurdish terrorists so Erdogan can use them for the election to show the Turkish public how he bent them to his will and so by his good graces he has decided to allow them into NATO.

We told the kids that it was a localized weather phenomenon because our nextdoor neighbor was always the nicest person and would always go out of his way to help everyone on the block - we wanted to wait until we knew more to tell them anything else.

Granted, he was sick and didn't realize it - cancer was ravaging his body, but he refused to see a doctor until the barricaded situation because he had interpreted the Fox programming he was consuming had led him to stop trusting medical professionals.  At the conclusion of the barricaded situation he was taken by ambulance to the hospital and that's when they found the cancer was eating him alive... this was pre-covid.

1) Maintain a Mariupol -> Melitopol -> Crimea land bridge, which would be a rather thin strip of land running across the eastern coast of Ukraine

2) Lock down the gains in the Donbas and Luhansk regions, to the territorial borders.

I suspect this is their new 'Mission Accomplished' goal.   However, that's really going to depend on Ukrainian willingness to enter into negotiations (which is highly unlikely) to allow that to happen.    I'm thinking the Russians will make a play for 'peace talks' once they've managed to take and hold the above territory, and do their typical non-negotiation negotiations.   They'll hope to either perform some force regeneration over a few months to renew the conflict, or prolong things to the point where they believe Ukrainian ally commitment starts to wane.

The west can agree with the proposed date, and change their tactics to indeed helping making this the real outcome. 2.

It is far more likely that they will first attempt to encircle the city, to cut off from reinforcements and supply, this is an achievable goal for the Russians, considering the momentum that they have built ever since they pushed from Popasna.   


If the Ukrainians lose Lysychanks, that is not ""all of Donbas"". the Donbas region is far bigger than those two cities, and it is not at all plausible that the Russians will be able to achieve a capture of the entire Donbas region anytime soon. They are making progress, but it is slow.  
And remember, capture isn't a permanent status, it can be recaptured.   
And even if the Russians are able to take the entire Donbas, how would they stop? declare victory? this isn't a game, you don't unilaterally declare victory, if the other side isn't willing to accept your peace terms, the war doesn't end.

Assuming the Russians are able to take the Donbas (this is a big IF) It is hard to say if they will have forces necessary to make another big push for a different objective. Most experts  believe that the Russians will have to perform a strategic pause at some point in the near future in order to consolidate and regroup and rest their troops.

At the same time, there is probably not enough data for an AI to learn the difference between ammo convoys/depots and those for other military supplies.

My neighbor's dad had serious mental issues after Vietnam.

Here's a thread by Twitterperson Thomas C. Theiner (@noclador), Italian Army vet, addressing the challenges of handling artillery supply, both in Russian and Western-style militaries.  [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1528024733983424512.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1528024733983424512.html)

I would point out parts 10-14 of that thread for relevant pictures.   Note that there is a lot of support equipment required to handle the unloading and positioning of ammunition packs  for the HIMARS to load and unload.  That is a LOT of heavy equipment.

So, if we were to provide the best loading conditions for the HIMARS to operate, not only would they need the HIMARS units themselves, but they would need the equipment to handle it.   All of that - the HIMARS units, the ammunition, and the support equipment - takes up a lot of room in a cargo plane, a boat, or a train, and it takes effort to get to the front.

Take that, and multiply this several times.  That is a LOT of equipment.   Equipment that not only needs to be brought in, but maintained.   And we're talking in an environment where (a) they're at war, (b) they're brand new to dealing with the logistical requirements of this equipment - just look at what the Russian-style ammo management looks like in that same thread, and (c) that's more equipment you have to provide security and safety from aerial attack.

Then multiply that again several times for each piece of new equipment they get from varying countries trying to help with the effort.   Each of those systems have their own needs and requirements to operate optimally, too.   The Ukrainians are not just spinning one dish on a pole - they have a whole boxful of plates they're having to keep spinning too.

It's not that the US and allies don't want to hand over a firehose worth of equipment.   But they have to make sure that the Ukrainians can handle it all, and squeeze out 100% of what those new pieces of equipment can give them.

As it stands today the response force deploys recon teams within 5 days and then takes 30 days to deploy all of it's troops and equipment. That might seem like a long time but just as the build up of Russian troops before they invaded Ukraine in February didn't go undetected any large build up means that 30 days is more than enough time and to move 300,000 troops from so many different countries would actually be very impressive.

So it's not like these forces are just sitting around doing nothing all geared up waiting to jump on a plane and be in come other country the next day. The training aspect I mentioned is huge, you need to train a bunch of different armies to work together under one joint command. And being able to make those deployment deadlines is no small task, a big difference between a reaction force of 40,000 versus 300,000 is that it will force NATO countries to make sure their logistics can handle moving their troops within those timelines. Then because of that aforementioned training they already did together they can hit the ground running as a large multinational force. If you don't work out this stuff beforehand countering a major Russian invasion of a NATO country, as impossible as that might seem at the moment, would have been far more chaos than it will be when you have 300,000 troops that have already practiced together and all the sea, ground and air transportation is in place to make it happen.

It's a huge increase but I think some people might think that ""high alert"" roughly equates to pilots sitting besides their jet fighter ready to jump into combat at a moments notice. In this case higher alert just means they can be made available in a certain number of days and that they have done the proper training so it hopefully isn't a total mess when they deploy to where the trouble is.",False,1656365247.0,t3_vlmgm3,t1_idz1imi,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

There's plenty of media coverage of alleged pressure on Ukraine to concede territory in order to end the war. It is just as prevalent as the escalatory stuff you are showcasing here.

Here is Joseph Borrell's remarks on 6/23, when he arrived in Brussels: https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/european-council-remarks-high-representative-josep-borrell-upon-arrival-3_en

>First, in Kaliningrad, there is not a blockade. The Lithuanian administration is implementing the guidelines of the [European] Commission in accordance with our sanctions. But, at the same time, we want to make controls that could prevent any kind of sanctions avoidance, and not preventing the traffic. And the [European] Commission and the European External Action Service are going to review the guidelines in order to clarify that we do not want to block or prevent the traffic between Russia and Kaliningrad. [There are] two objectives: to prevent circumvention of the sanctions; and not to block the traffic. Both things should be possible, and we are working on that.

They had to drastically change their operational goals, from the whole country + capital, down to half the country down to a small section of the country and now, a small city in that small section of the country, maybe the one after that too?

They have depleted massive amounts of their guided missile stock, that will be very hard to replenish. it's not that they have none anymore, they just cant shoot as many

There biggest losses have been in armored vehicles, literally thousands of tanks, IFVs and APCs lost that will basically be impossible to replace, scrap metal in a foreign land. They do have some tanks in storage to be repaired (costly as fuck) and could make a nominal amount of new vehicles, though never enough to replace the losses (looking at you, T-14 and BMP-T)

Planes are a big loss each time one is downed, and while Ukraine has shot down a decent number there are likely many more in reserve, but still an unfortunate loss for an economy as small as Russia's.

Their small logistics fleet of trucks has been forced to stay further from the front. Large numbers of trucks (of which Russia already had too few of) were destroyed in the first days of the war, now they have tried to keep them back from the front to stop losses, to moderate success.

The loss of the Moscva is in no way decisive, but is a huge embarrassment. A missile defense ship dying to what amounts to a knock off brand anti-ship missile made in house by Ukraine.

So why hasn't Ukraine won? well no doubt they have also lost a decent chunk of stuff as well, and is also even poorer and smaller than Russia. So relatively speaking Russia can continue to fight with less and less equipment so long as they outmatch their opponents, which they still do.

>Trade, yes, when it advantages India. Supporting Russia? No.

India has a problem where they have pretty hostile relations to two of their neighbors. Pakistan and China.

India was forced to get friendlier with Russia because of US - Pakistan relations during the cold war. The US - Pakistan relations were again strengthened during the war on terror in Afghanistan, but relations soured towards the end of the war.

With the US allied to one enemy, and China on not the best terms, they only had Russia to fall back on.

Now, the current state would be the perfect time for India to get closer ties with the US / Europe, but it seems like they are not doing it.",False,1656322945.0,t3_vlmgm3,t1_idwljhx,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Their flagship cruiser which should have had the latest and greatest of their technology was sunk by 2 missiles it was designed to defend against. Just poof. Like that.

Let's take an objective look at the situation, shall we? Russia has all but stalled on every front.

Will they regain momentum? No. More HIMARS are on the way, as is anti-air, counter battery radars and precision guided artillery. In another couple of months, Ukraine will be a veritable fortress. Impossible for Russia to continue advancing, no matter how much cannon fodder they're willing to expens. Then, at a time of Ukraine's choosing, the counterattack will start. Ukraine has more reserves, better training, better command structure, better intelligence, better logistics, better weapons, and support of insurgents in the occupied territories.

I don't buy it.

What we've done is cause Ukranians to bleed and die so that the NATO/US can politically ""adjust"" to the reality that they have to send real shit.  The only way to do that is to show that Russia isn't just going to flash-in-the-pan this, that they're going to hang in there and continue to cause suffering in Ukraine.

In the latter, who knows?  Imagine if NATO/US had put boots on the ground.  That *would* be viewed as an existential threat to Russia (no matter how we intended it).

Hussein had a similar strategy and even similar fighting g strength and components to the current Russian force in Ukraine. And the reason it was so ineffective was because the sheer power of the Coalition airforce rendered this whole ground fighting obsolete.

It does cost a lot more to do this strategy but the benefit is you don't have to do it very long before a conventional force is no more.

However, a more experienced pilot would take less than half that time, and someone requalifying on type after a break would only take a few weeks. If operational reasons demanded, then a much shorter course for experienced pilots learning a new type, focussed only on the relevant tactics and weapons, could be done in four to six weeks, much of which could be done on simulators.

-----

Ideally, you do things like Super TSpin Double, or even Imperial Cross (less reliable in practice, despite the easy-to-see pattern) to set up multiple TSD in a row.

TST + TSpin mini-single is only 7 or 8 damage. Yes, you clean the overhang, but Super TSpin Double is 9 damage.

Study TKI, Albatross, Pelican, DT Cannon at first. These are easy (erm... easier) openings that have a lot of applicability to the mid-game.

DT Cannon is probably the 1st TSpin opening to teach, given how easy it is and consistent. (But 3-bags to setup is slower than others)

TKI is probably the best opening for T-Spin double practice.

Albatross and Pelican are your introductions to floating-TSpins.

-----------

From there, you study Super-TSD, King Crimson, Infinite TSpin Triples, etc. etc. and carry forth.

Its easier to setup from ""the opening"" due to how the bag-randomizer works. Once you can consistently do it in the opening, you then start practicing mid-game setups (mid-game pattern recognition). Since your fingers know how to do it from opening practice, your brain isn't working quite as hard and you're better able to recognize the patterns.

DT, Super-TSD, King Crimson, Infinite TST are strategies to convert 2x or 3x T-pieces into a solid burst of 9 to 14 damage, which can KO your opponents in practice.

Deep Battle doctrine did work wonders - Soviets just needed time to prepare it. Shooting your own men in the back is another myth - this only happened to penal battalions. Later on Germans were sustaining losses equivalent to the Soviets.

The West really did underestimate Ukraine and planned on supporting an occupied insurgency, but I think you're mistaken by calling what's happening as ""slowly drip feeding"". Sending military equipment around Europe and around in the world, without access to the sea ports, really is a huge task.

Yes, Ukraine needs a lot more supplies and equipment, and they ask for more, but just because we're not giving them the amounts they need upfront doesn't mean we're not moving quickly. Ukraine may need a thousand HIMARS, but we may only be able to deliver between 5-20 in a week (I don't know the actual logistical limit). Also, all of these weapons and the associated shipping cost money, which is being done amidst inflation and economic woes. Of course it would be great if we could just give Ukraine a thousand HIMARS, a million+ rockets today and have them end the war tomorrow, but Ukraine's logistical lines extend around the entire world and they're *still*  giving Russia hell right near its own borders.

For context, Russia built up its entire invasion force over 3 months, yet just 4 months later Ukraine's military arsenal is beginning to be upgraded (with relevant training), and Russia has still failed to achieve air supremacy (and in fact seems to avoid flying in Ukraine), and their offensive has slowed to a crawl. Effectively, Ukraine has almost all of the ingredients for their own NFZ (with more anti-air upgrades on the way), against a country that should have had air supremacy almost instantly. They achieved this largely with the support of western weapons.

There are obviously some key players dragging their feet on things, but overall Ukraine is already transforming into one of the strongest non-NATO militaries in the world thanks in no small part to western support (training, weapons and supplies).

Currently, Russia has an air advantage (heavily impacted) and an artillery advantage. Each delivery of HIMARS and anti-air reduces those advantages. You really won't see the difference until the tide has turned (offensive stalls and switches). But Ukraine is already on an upgrade path that will wipe out the last few advantages Russia has.

Russia has very few options to counter these upgrades. They have a collapsing domestic military complex, that can't be restored by their collapsing economy, and they can't effectively innovate after 30+ years of brain drain, and they can't effectively govern an alternate path after decades of the grift.

Russia started this war with a *huge* military advantage (and the element of surprise, and months of planning), and in a matter of months that has dropped to the point of near-even footing, thanks to both Ukrainian bravery (and strength) and western support.

Ukrainians dying is not an acceptable price at all (but it is an imposed one, thanks to Russia launching this stupid invasion), and if the war ended tomorrow (Russia withdrawing and/or surrendering) it'd be fucking great. But it's going to take time for weapons to really turn the tide. We have to source them, we have to move them, and we have to teach Ukrainians how to use them. And we're doing all 3 of these things, while being cut off from energy supplies, while dealing with inflation and a looming recession, while dealing with our own internal politics.",False,1656346215.0,t3_vlmgm3,t1_idxj4w2,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

For quite a while, in fact right up until modern smart munitions really took off, the US and most militaries, or at least segments of many militaries, adhered to the idea that a civilian population is in many senses an extension of the military. They provide food, clothes, weapons, medical treatment, and manpower that create a military.  Target the civilians, as the logic goes, and you degrade the enemy's ability to make war economically, demoralize their fighting spirit, and get closer to victory.  

Whether this thinking is right or wrong - and I believe it is tragically wrong - it justified some of the most horrible moments in human warfare, such as the fire bombings of Dresden and Tokyo, and ultimately the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

The point being that this logic is not limited to the Russian state or Russian society writ large and I believe trying to argue that it is somehow intrinsic to some flaw in the Russian people is also tragically misguided. 

Of course, it is hard to say if the mall itself was specifically targeted or just hit by mistake, as some sources report a military target is a short distance away from the mall.

Apparently not, since they have gone from trying to take Kyiv and encircle the whole Donbass to fighting for some no name villages in less than 4 months.

Meanwhile Ukraine is fighting the war for its existence. They can draft pretty much the whole population if needed.



 _""and hundreds of times more equipment than the Ukrainians, western supplied included.""_

Russia already lost more than a half of all combat ready tanks in the country. They are forced to use outdated T-62.  With the arrival of HIMARS Ukraine will likely negate Russian advantage in artillery as well.
