>In repeat bombing of Odesa, Putin deepens economic war on Ukraine
>
>PAVLIVKA, Ukraine — When four Russian cruise missiles ripped apart a grain storage facility in this southern village last week, shock waves shattered the windows of adjacent homes, sending broken glass everywhere.
>
>One shard left a nearly three-inch wound in the arm of Tetiana Lazarova, a nearby resident who jumped out of her bed after she heard the second explosion.
>
>“The sound was so foul,” she said. “It felt like the world was ending.”
>
>Like many of the farmers who live near Odesa, one of Ukraine’s major port cities, Lazarova is convinced that Moscow’s attacks on the port and its agriculture sector are aimed at extracting maximum pain following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to terminate a United Nations-brokered deal allowing grain exports from the Black Sea.
>
>“They’re sick! They are doing it on purpose!” she said, nursing a bandage on her arm as she stood among twisted scraps of metal strewn about the nearby homes.
>
>Odessa’s grain industry suffered tens of millions of dollars in damage due to the near-nightly Russian airstrikes. According to the U.N. World Food Program, the attacks destroyed at least 60,000 tons of grain, enough to feed more than 270,000 people for a year.
>
>Follow-on attacks Monday targeted grain warehouses along the Danube River — a critical alternative route for exports following the collapse of the Black Sea deal — and appeared to be aimed at crippling the country’s entire agricultural industry, which accounted for about 20 per cent of Ukraine’s economy before Russia’s invasion.
>
>On Thursday, another Russian missile hit Odesa’s cargo terminal and administrative buildings, killing one employee, Ukraine’s military said.
>
>Russia, one of the world’s largest producers of fertilizer, said it backed out of the Black Sea deal because it was being implemented to benefit only Ukraine and was not resulting in a substantial increase of exports of Russian grain and fertilizer because of Western sanctions — a point fiercely disputed by the United Nations, the United States and international aid agencies.
>
>“Only upon receipt of concrete results, and not promises and assurances, will Russia be ready to consider restoring the deal,” Russia’s Foreign Ministry said.
>
>U.S. officials reject that Western sanctions are to blame and see Putin executing an explicit strategy. “This is very intentional,” Samantha Power, the U.S. Agency for International Development administrator, told reporters this week after returning from a visit to Odessa.
>
>Not only is Putin using “food as a weapon of war,” Power said, “but it also appears to be part of an ongoing campaign to decimate Ukraine’s economy.” Many Ukrainian farmers also face the danger of thousands of deadly land mines and other unexploded ordnance now strewn across their fields.
>
>The Black Sea deal, forged by the United Nations and Turkey in July 2022, ended a four-month Russian naval blockade of Ukraine’s ports that had dramatically curtailed Ukraine’s exports, devastating its already war-battered economy. The following year, the deal allowed Ukraine to export 33 million tons of grain and other food products.
>
>Power has made it her goal to salvage Ukraine’s agricultural sector, announcing an additional $250 million to increase the rate of loading and unloading at Danube ports, expand access to financing for farmers who lost business in the war and cannot afford to plant new crops, and streamline Western border checkpoints to increase trade.

""Blindness to Russian colonialism distorts Westerners’ view of the Ukraine war""

\--------------

The tell in West's remarks was calling the U.S. an empire but referring to Russia by its de jure name, implicitly erasing its imperial, colonial character. It's a common tendency among the segment of the left to which West belongs, one that Kazakhstan-born Pitzer College sociology professor Azamat Junisbai attributes to ignorance and a myopic, know-nothing focus on American imperialism to the exclusion of imperialism by other nations.

""They're kind of imperial about their anti-imperialism,"" Junisbai said. ""There's something very provincial and strange about it where you literally do not know anything about what's happening beyond this one issue you care about.""

While West and other leftists blame ""NATO expansion"" for provoking Russia, Junisbai compares NATO membership – which, after all, the former Warsaw Pact and Baltic countries all sought voluntarily – to a restraining order against an abusive partner.

""People don't recognize that there was an abusive relationship, that there was colonialism,"" he said, speculating that blindness to Russian colonialism could be due to a failure of Western education systems as well as Soviet propaganda and leftist valorization of the Soviet Union as a foe of Western imperialism. Another potential culprit is knee-jerk distrust toward American foreign policy popular among some leftists and alternative media that leads to a simplistic ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" worldview.

""People, I think, just get so wedded to their vision of themselves as fighting 'The Man,' fighting the power that they are blinded and taken for a ride by Russia, in this case serving as useful idiots,"" Junisbai said.",False,1690644019.0,t3_15cic48,t3_15cic48,,0,94,0,94,0,0,

**What does the data show?**  
In short, Ukraine controls 80.5% of her core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22 2022, and up from 80.3% six weeks ago (equating to 400 square miles recaptured). Prior to last year's invasion, control was at 90.9%. 

Since the Ukrainian counter-offensive began in early June, some 550 square miles have been retaken. In 2023, Russian forces have lost approximately 850 square miles of territory on net, despite some localised gains and the costly offensive in the Bakhmut direction. In 2023, at least 34,000 Russian soldiers have been killed. Approximately 14,000 Ukrainian soldiers have also been killed in the same time.

🔴 Russian KIAs are an estimated 73,400 (± 7,300), with a 30-day average of 140 KIA per day, down from 160 KIA per day last month.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs are an estimated 28,700 (± 1,400), with a 30-day average of 110 KIA per day, up from 80 KIA per day last month.

Note: this territorial analysis and estimates of KIA both rely only on publicly available data and should be taken only as illustrating long-term trends, not as scientific data points. These numbers are retrospectively revised as new, more trusted, estimates or maps emerge.

> Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the main intelligence directorate of Ukraine’s defence ministry, has raised the prospect of Ukrainian forces “soon” entering Crimea in an effort to retake the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.

> Budanov, Sky News reports, citing TSN, did not specify a date in which the military operation would begin. However, Crimea has been subject to attacks in recent weeks – including the explosion which damaged the Kerch bridge.

some of the recent attacks by the ukr forces (company sized) have not looked great..  
and many have sat back and stated things about the command and judgements...  
the simple facts are......  
1. this is war and losses will be taken..  
2. ukr is on the offensive and the losses will go up now..  
3. we are not on the ground, we dont know the intel, we dont know the prep, and we dont know the overall real ground truth.  
4. as bad as some assults look we are finding out that most of them do gain ground and ukr is moving forward...   
5. this is a HARD fight without traditional air support, with a peer that MOST people thought would crush them in 3 days.   
6. war is hard, its dirty, it never goes as expected, and there are always losses, even in the best operations.  
7. some people are fixating on losses and not looking at the big picture.. few of the forces have been used so far, and more are coming.   
8. im not going to pile on a company commander right now that may have had a bad mission.  many times that commander is the first to die.  constructive feedback is good and needed, and if a higher commander is needed to be replaced it will happen.  have faith in the guys on the ground im confident that in the end ukr will have a breakthrough... till then the fight will be hard, and there will be losses.. but ukr will win the war.""

With that being said, I wouldn’t put it past Putin to orchestrate a false flag (he’s done it before), hoping have the west reconsider sending Ukraine drones or some shit like that.

Solar is one example, the government in all countries could have solar installed on every roof, not 3kw per roof but roofs full of solar cells to their capacity.. Right now we are suffering in the Uk from unrealistic electricity prices, while the government of the people could very quickly make electricity almost free. But then they could not enjoy the massive or even minor bribes that give them the ability to live in comfort while so many struggles from day to day. All other systems used and promoted cost more for electricity than even the older cheaper systems. Yet they do not need to burn millions of tons of coal or gas a year.

Or container gardens which are able to grow as much as an average size farm every year using 1% of the water and no electricity as solar is all needed to grow anything. Why do we not see hundreds of them in every city supplying veg for consumption, very fresh veg harvested every week?

Some countries have proven this beyond any argument that big business or governments spread, encouraging naysayers to mock or disagree with the facts, nuclear the worst pollution energy producer is promoted every time you see anyone talk about solar, but it is seriously polluting no matter what they say about new cleaner nuclear coming soon to a shop near you.

That comment shows your countries propaganda is working fine.

For context my wife is Polish and when we first met we went to a few museums and all. I pointed out that Russian propaganda never really worked for the Poles; they knew they had to say they believed but they also knew there was no toilet paper in the shops (or anything else).

Then we went to the US and saw just how stunningly good US propaganda is. Lots of Americans don't even realise that the word American when referring to citizens of the USA is in itself propaganda. Getting a crowd to chant U S A U S A at the drop of hat? well you can guess I would chuck that in the propaganda basket.

At least when Australians do the aussie aussie aussie oi oi oi thing most of them are being slightly facetious. And at least some tv people for the Olympics got worried enough about the xenophobic undertones to put up a prize for something else to yell.

I noted your previous comment history, which you now deleted.

* Biden was right, Putin has to go.
* The Russia leaves Ukraine.
* Deported children & people return home to Ukraine. 
* At least Putin & Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova are sent to The Hague.
* Security for Ukraine in form of NATO & EU.
* Demilitarize the Russia.

To fulfill those the Russia must ofc acknowledge the war crimes & the genocide.

That is to start with, then we can discuss how the Russia will pay for building up Ukraine. Eg natural resources, frozen assets, etc.

Meanwhile send more weapons, better weapons, longer ranges. Send missiles, jets, tanks, cluster bombs. It is very well spent tax money.

My point is that cheap drones can be a significant threat to us if their numbers are too much. We shouldn't underestimate them just because they're bad individually. And neither should we rely on other countries military being trash.

We've seen Ukraine how they're using cheap drones quite effectively.

Cheap drones, unlike stuff like rifles, tanks, etc. don't put much risk on your side if something goes wrong. They're disposable for a reason and can be used in high risk situations without putting anything valuable on your side at risk. And using many of them at once can create a great threat even against targets that may be able to destroy a couple of them. They're effective against any target, whether it's infantry or tanks. Although for the latter it's more in terms of crippling its capabilities instead of actually destroying it. i.e. taking out cameras and sensors.

Drones are an integral part of the future of warfare and that's for both the expensive ones and the cheap ones. That's why I compared cheap drones to something like grenades. Grenades ain't some wonder weapons and they're quite cheap, which allows them to be used in large numbers. Of course drones won't be as widespread as grenades, but imagine if there is a drone specialist in every few squads with a few drones in his backpack. Whether it's reconnaissance or using a suicide drone to attack a fortified position, all of that opens up many options for soldiers on the ground. Sure, a predator drone (and their newer versions) are great, but if you can have a hundred squads equipped with a drone specialist instead then that's also a great option. And in terms of cost the difference is really that big.

Of course these are all just possibilities. How widespread drone usage will become in the future and how quickly we'll reach that point are all things still unknown for us.",False,1690658380.0,t3_15cic48,t1_jtz4xbt,,8,1,0,1,0,0,
