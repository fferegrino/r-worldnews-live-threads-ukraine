**Q- Reporter**

**A - Biden**

**Q: Do you have any plans to talk to Putin? Will this be spiralling out of control?**

A; It's a large conflict already, in particular with the Eastern Baltic states \[?\]. I have no plans to talk with Putin.

**Q: Why have you not mentioned Swift - are allies not willing to use SWIFT as a sanction tool?**

A: Our current sanctions will be hitting Putin hard enough. SWIFT is not an option that the rest of Europe wishes to take.

**Q: Sanctions is no. How and when will this end? Will he go beyond Ukraine? Is Putin threating Nuclear Strikes.**

A: (sigh) Nobody knows what he'll be doing, only what he's done. Nobody thought that the sanctions would prevent the War. He's testing our resolve..

**Q: How painful will the sanctions get for American people.**

A: As long as we stand united and impose sanctions, we will \[didn't catch this\]

**Q: Would you still describe Putin as a worthy opponent? Would you still underestimate him?**

A: I never underestimated him, and I still think him a worthy adversary. Have you read his books? He has larger ambitions - he wants to re-establish the Soviet Union.

**Q: If Sanctions can't stop him, what can?**

A: Threat of sanctions and the effect of the sanctions are two different things. We will weaken his country so much, that he'll have to make a big decision.

Sanctioning Putin is on the table.

**Q: Why not sanctioning Putin today?**

No answer given.

**Q: Respectfully, what more are you waiting for to use SWIFT as a sanction?**

A: Our current sanctions exceed SWIFT. Let's see if they are working.

**Q: Is there a complete rift in Russian/American Relationship/the beginning of a new Cold War?**

A: There is a complete rift in Russia/American relationship. About Cold War - we stand united. You don't see many people coming to this defense?

**Q: Should China also help to isolate Russia?**

A: Not prepared to comment on that on the moment.

**Q: Will you help if he moves to NATO country?**

A: Yes. If we don't stop him now with sanctions, he will be emboldened.

**Q: Is India fully in sync with you about RUssia?**

A: We are in consultation with India about that at the moment.",1645731329.0,1645730238.0,t3_t0i53m,t3_t0i53m,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

\---------------------------

*Putin just started a war without justification.*

*He moved more than 160000 troops, equipment and blood banks to the border. This tells you all you need to know about his intentions.*

*For weeks, we have been warning that this would happen.*

*Last week, we have seen shelling increased in the Donbass. More cyberattacks, a state theater in Moscow, declaring that Ukraine committed a genocide & was ready to use chemical weapons without any justification, without any evidence*

*At the very moment the UN was meeting to starting, Putin declared his war.*

*Then the missiles fell, the air raids, the tanks...*

*We have been transparent with the world, and declassified confidential information.*

*Let me be clear - Putin is the Aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the costs.*

***I'm declaring new sanctions, designed for long-term impact on Russia and minimise impact on US& allies. We are not doing this alone - More than 1/2 of the global economy (Au, Ja, Ger, ...) stand united in these sanctions. We will limit Russia's participation in the global economy, their ability to grow their economy, etc.***

***We have already seen the impact on the Russian Rubel, which early today hits its weakest limit ever.*** *Today's actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks ($1.3 Trillion assets) and other banks - cut off the American system - their assets will be frozen.*

*This includes VBT. We will also sanction oligarchs and their family members. They profited off the system, they will share the pain.*

***On Tuesday, we stopped Russia from getting money from European banks. Our sanctions will now target the Russian industry.***

*One of the most powerful impact will come over time. We will cut off over more than 1/2 of Russia's tech imports. We will hurt their ability in space, ships and compete economically.*

*We will hurt Putin's long-term ambitions for Russia.*

*Tomorrow, we will convene NATO and confirm our unity and map the next steps. Our forces will not be engaged in conflict in Ukraine, but they will defend and assure our allies in the East. The United states will defend every inch of NATO territory. NATO is more united than ever. There's no doubt they will all meet the NATO 5 Article. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.*

***I have authorised deployment of troops in Estonia, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Our allies have also stepped up and given provisions.***

***NATO came together and activated a response plan - we can deploy as and when to needed. I'm authorising an additional deployment to Germany - airforce troops (?). I have also discussed additional moves should they become necessary.***

*My government is doing everything to protect American families at the gas pump. Businesses should not exploit this to raise the prices. We are monitoring the prices of gas supply. We are working with other countries to ensure that the impact is minimal. US will be releasing additional barrels if warranted.*

*It's critical to me to me that American families will not be impacted.*

*But it would be much more if we let this agression continue.*

*If Russia continues to pursue cyberattacks, we will respond. We have taken all precautions and are prepared for Cyber attacks. We will provide Ukraine with relief & tech to relieve their suffering.*

*..But the Ukrainians have known 30 years of independence, and they will not let their country be taken.*

*This is a dangerous moment for Europe. Now we all see what Putin and his allies are all about. This was never a security concern. It was always about changing is borders - a war without a cause.*

***The US and its allies will emerge from this stronger, united and more purposeful. Putin's aggression will hurt Russia economically and ??. We will make sure of that.***

***Any country that stands with him will be stained by association.***

Just look at the sanctions that have already been announced, those are very very significant sanctions already and there still is more on the table.

These sanctions genuinely have the potential to cripple the russian economy for decades and mr Biden is correct in saying, that it could come down to a test of resolve, to see who blinks first. 

But beyond sanctions, NATO has and is still delivering weapons to Ukraine. They are sharing intel with them. They are doing anything they can, short of putting boots on the ground - because the second a russian soldiers shoots at a NATO soldier, we have WW3. Yall need to take a moment and consider that - its not cool like the CoD games, it would be a total fucking catastrophe. 

And imo it was always clear, that Ukraine would have to fight alone and most likely, at some point will get overwhelmed by the numbers and air superiority.

BUT, and heres a thing i liked about Biden's speech - territorial gain is the easy part in an invasion, controlling it is a whole different ball game.

And this is where the sanctions come back into play - if Ukraine is able to fight an asymmetrical war, while its people rise up against russian oppression in combination with those severe sanctions, it will become a real endurance test for Putler quickly

And i do think that not even Putler would want that - right now, he is just playing up to this madman persona because it aids him and prevents the rest of the world to bother him.",1645730303.0,1645729997.0,t3_t0i53m,t3_t0i53m,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Sanctions are a good move. Holding out on further sanctions gives us bargaining power if the situation continues to escalate. Unfortunately it will take time for the effects to be felt, but hopefully it will cause further division between Russian citizens and the oligarchy. 

Lots of people want an immediate solution but putting boots on the ground escalates things dramatically at the expense of everyone, especially those on the front line. It seems like we are still gathering intelligence and communicating with other world leaders, and I think that is a good and diplomatic move. 

The reporters asked some silly questions, how can you expect Biden to predict the future about how China will react, if Putin will move past Ukraine, what exactly he meant by a vague threat, or how the stock market will handle it?

NATO's goal is to ensure that this doesn't reach as far that. Hence troops on NATO borders, more supplies to Ukraine, etc.

So why wait on the sanctions? Sanctions are probably our best, universally approved hand to play. If you play it now Russia still finishes off Ukraine and then based on how well they're doing economically, decides whether to push their luck further.

https://www.itv.com/news/2022-02-24/in-full-uk-hits-russia-with-most-severe-set-of-sanctions-it-has-ever-seen

Here's the full list of sanctions:

The government plans to freeze all UK assets of all major Russian banks with immediate effect, including an immediate freeze on the country's biggest bank, VTB Bank.

Legislation will be introduced on Tuesday to prohibit all major Russian firms from raising finance in the UK and prevent the Russian state from raising sovereign debt in the UK.

Over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries will be sanctioned, including Russia's biggest defence company and several oligarchs.

Oligarchs hit personally by the sanctions:
- Kirill Shamalov, Russia's youngest billionaire formerly married to Mr Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova.
- Pyotr Fradkov, the head of sanctioned Promsvyazbank, and son of former head of FSB.
- Denis Bortnikov, the deputy president of VTB bank.
- Yury Slyusar, the director of United Aircraft Corporation, one of major defence organisations which is also being sanctioned.
- Elena Georgieva, the chair of the board of Novikombank, which bankrolls Rostec.

The government is also looking to imminently ban all Russian Airlines - commonly known as Aeroflot - from landing in the UK.

All dual export licences on any items that could be used in the Russian military will be suspended immediately.

Within days all high tech exports and exports in the extractives industry (eg, oil refinery) to Russia will be prohibited.

Legislation will be introduced to limit deposits Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts.

The UK will work with allies to essentially shut off Russian access to SWIFT international payment system.

The full range of measures will be extended to Belarus given its ties to the Russian state.

Unexplained wealth orders will be strengthened under the economic crime bill which will be brought to Parliament before Easter recess.",False,1645729355.0,t3_t0i53m,t3_t0i53m,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

In the event of an increased influx of people from Ukraine to Slovakia, we are ready to strengthen the control and service at the Slovak-Ukrainian border and increase the number of border crossings by so-called hotspots. Here, the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic will also help the members of the Police Force so that we can register the incoming people and guide them.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

**Entry will be granted to all persons fleeing the war.**  
**Entry into the territory of the Slovak Republic will be made possible after individual assessment also to persons who will not have a valid travel document (biometric passport).**  
The current waiting times at the Vyšné Nemecké border crossing are 8 hours and at the Ubľa border crossing 360 minutes. It cannot be ruled out that the waiting time at these border crossings may be extended.

In the event of an increased influx of people from Ukraine to Slovakia, we are ready to strengthen the control and service at the Slovak-Ukrainian border and increase the number of border crossings by so-called hotspots.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

 YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

Here's why. 

Sanctions will hurt Russia, I get that. But that takes time to hurt them and Russia could destroy Ukraine by the time they really start to feel the pain of sanctions. So at that point there is nothing Russia can do to get the sanctions removed, right? Because you did the damage so the punishment stays. Like if Russia just had a button to instantly burn the country to the ground in an hour and then go back home the world wouldn't say ""ok you pulled back your troops so we will remove the sanctions now"". No, the country is destroyed so the sanctions would stay in place forever, I'd assume. 

Which would piss off Russia and when their economy on the verge of collapse from sanctions (I'm assuming that's the goal they are basically threatening) then they'd need to invade somewhere else as a threat to get resources or to make NATO stand down. 

Which at that point that triggers article 5 and we get WW3. So basically sanctions now just seem to be sacrificing a country and hoping it pulls a miracle or WW3 happens eventually if Ukraine falls.

I want to be wrong, but can someone show me an alternative or am I not thinking how the sanctions change or something if Ukraine falls?",False,1645731273.0,t3_t0i53m,t3_t0i53m,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.”
> 
> The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
> The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
> The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
> Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
> Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
> Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
> The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.”
> The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
> Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
> Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
> Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”
> Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
> Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
> Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”",False,1645729037.0,t3_t0i53m,t3_t0i53m,,0,0,0,0,0,0,

Yes , you can sanctions  putin directly,  but sanctioning from the bottom of the pyramid is more effective then sanctioning from the very top. 

I hope this helps you. 

So you could freeze putins Assets today, but he would just pull them from somewhere else, sanctioning from the bottom  means that everything is cheaper for any other nation state to buy, and more expensive for Russia, which effectively doubles the rate of whatever the sanctions effect are. 

I.e . The ruble drops by 20%, it acts actually as 40% . 

So tanks become more expensive for Russia to build, and because the states dollar is worth more in comparison, cheaper for the US to build, because procuring the resource rich material becomes easier.

Yeah, asking about SWIFT is legit, but not everyone in NATO is in agreement. The U.S. can't just do whatever the hell they want while also trying to strengthen our alliances. The ""no comment"" on the question about ""China's response"" is perfect...because that's obviously some classified shit and not a great idea to provoke an even stronger alliance between Russia and China. Also loved the question about India, cause I hadn't kept up with that yet and the response was exactly what it is...we haven't figured all of that out yet.

This all sucks, but we're also trying to prevent another World War, which seems to be an underlying goal of this Russian invasion. Seems like Putin wants to trigger us into joining a fight, so that his actions can be claimed as ""self-defense"" while he tries to destabilize NATO. Hoping we can get some stronger sanctions going and further strengthen our alliances, but it's definitely not an uncomplicated situation.

I think the more likely situation is that Putin has gotten desperate.  He basically staked his legacy on rebuilding the USSR in a pseudo form via the [Eurasian Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union).  To do this he committed to using [The Foundations of Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) as his roadmap. (Nearly every action he's taken seems to pull from the book)

Unfortunately I think now he knows his gamble won't pay off. Ukraine more or less shifted towards wanting the EU/NATO by 2013, which lead him to invade (which furthered their desire to move west). That then stalled the EAU completely (Ukraine was a key partner from the beginning).  It lead to sanctions that made the EAU less than viable as an economic block.  This completely stalled it since it went live in 2015.

Additionally some of his expectations that his ""playbook"" was correct may have been a miscalculation.  A consensus seems to be that he didn't expect NATO to respond as it did (especially given its reacion in 2014). I believe he thought he'd destabilized NATO further than he did. (And I also suspect he expected a second Trump term, where it was reported that Trump was going to pull the US out of NATO. Which would have made his move on Ukraine a perfect moment to truly break the alliance)

So now he's got a failing economy, a high mortality rate from the pandemic, and limited prospects for a meaningful legacy. All while plans he needed/expected to happen didn't go to fruition.",False,1645732364.0,t3_t0i53m,t1_hya4gn6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

> Voyager 1 was speeding out of the solar system — beyond Neptune and about 3.7 billion miles (6 billion kilometers) from the Sun — when mission managers commanded it to look back toward home for a final time. It snapped a series of 60 images that were used to create the first “family portrait” of our solar system.

> The picture that would become known as the Pale Blue Dot shows Earth within a scattered ray of sunlight. Voyager 1 was so far away that — from its vantage point — Earth was just a point of light about a pixel in size.

> Sagan also was a member of the Voyager Imaging Team. He had the original idea in 1981 to use the cameras on one of the two Voyager spacecraft to image Earth.

According to a Ukrainian veteran, Putin intended today's offensive as a blitzkrieg: blast everything with missiles, cause chaos and panic, then roll in quickly, encircle major cities, and force a surrender in short order.

This clearly didn't work out, the Russian army is currently getting bogged down, their main offensive on Kharkiv having stalled completely. In other areas they're taking more casualties as time goes on.

This idea is supported by Putin having offered Ukraine negotiations about a few hours ago, about them becoming a neutral country:

[https://www.unian.net/politics/putin-pytaetsya-prinudit-ukrainu-k-peregovoram-novosti-ukraina-11716054.html](https://www.unian.net/politics/putin-pytaetsya-prinudit-ukrainu-k-peregovoram-novosti-ukraina-11716054.html)

As a rule of thumb, if you're certain you'll win, you don't offer your enemy negotiation 12 hours after invading them.

In the meantime, the first anti-war protests are springing up across Russia. Things might just get out of hand as losses for the Russians mount.

&#x200B;

In other words, this will not be over as fast as ""some"" might hope. Ukrainians have been prepared for guerilla warfare for some time now, which once again prevent a blitzkreig

We already have boots on the ground in continental NATO member states so as soon as an ally is attacked the balloon goes up. You will see a lot of morons - otherwise known as trumpers - ask “why didn’t this happen under trump?”

Because Putin didn’t need to; trump was a wrecking ball where NATO and our European allies were concerned. Look at how shitty he was to merkel & macron while fawning over putin. Trump got mad at Denmark (who does that?) because they immediately dismissed his proposal to buy Greenland (really, who the fuck does that?).

Before getting elected in 2016, Trump already showed signs of weakness when it came to his political benefactors in Moscow. During the Republican National Convention, for example, the candidate and his team showed no real interest in the platform’s contents, except to remove language about providing Ukraine with defensive weapons.

Also before Election Day, Trump touted Putin for having “outsmarted“ U.S. leaders.

All the while, Trump was seeking, receiving, benefiting from, and lying about Russia’s intervention in the 2016 elections on his behalf.

During the post-election presidential transition period, Trump spoke openly about easing sanctions on Russia, which roughly coincided with Michael Flynn’s secret communications with Russia, which he would later lie to the FBI about.

Two weeks after his inauguration day, Trump talked about his “respect” for Putin. Reminded that the Russian autocrat is a “killer,” the new American president questioned his own country’s moral authority. “We’ve got a lot of killers,” the Republican said. “What, do you think our country’s so innocent?”

Two weeks later, top members of Trump’s team explored ways to lift sanctions against Russia.

Trump had only been in office for a few months when he prepared to reward Russia — apparently in exchange for nothing — by giving it diplomatic compounds on American soil that had been taken during the Obama administration.
The same month, Trump welcomed Russian diplomats into the Oval Office — at Putin’s request — at which time the Republican revealed highly classified information to his Russian guests for no apparent reason.

By July 2017, as Congress approved new sanctions against Russia for having attacked our elections, the Trump White House tried to weaken the legislation. The then-president grudgingly signed the bill — not because he supported it, but because it passed by veto-proof margins. He then issued a statement criticizing Congress’ proposal.

The same month, Trump had a private chat with Putin, after which the Republican announced plans to partner with Russia on an “impenetrable Cyber Security unit.”

In August 2017, the Russian government expelled 755 people from the American embassy and consulate staff. Trump responded by “thanking” Putin and saying he “greatly appreciated” the striking diplomatic move.

In early 2018, after Putin won a sham election, White House officials pleaded with Trump not to congratulate the Russian leader. The Republican ignored them.

A few months later, Trump appeared alongside Putin in Helsinki, lashed out at Americans he doesn’t like, and announced that he considered the Russian leader more reliable than his own country’s intelligence agencies. As 2018 neared its end, Trump lifted Russian sanctions.

In 2019, leveraged military aid to launch an illegal extortion scheme with Ukraine, personally forced out a capable U.S. ambassador in Ukraine, and called for Russia to be welcomed back into the G7.

During his re-election campaign, Trump also prepared to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany, which also happened to be in line with Moscow’s wishes.

All the while, Trump criticized NATO, expressed disdain for the European Union, and undermined democracy in the United States — which also put the Republican’s agenda in line with Putin’s plans.

Trump’s own director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, suggested to Bob Woodward that he couldn’t shake the suspicion that Trump was beholden to Putin.
