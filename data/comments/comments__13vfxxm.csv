https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-30-23/index.html

""The US expects Sweden’s accession to NATO to be completed “in the weeks ahead,” according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.

“We have no doubt that it can be, and it should be and we expect it to be,” said Blinken at a news conference in Luleå, Sweden, with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.

Key context: Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine prompted non-aligned Finland and Sweden to abandon their neutrality and seek protection within NATO. Finland officially became the 31st member of NATO on April 4.

US President Joe Biden said he spoke on Monday with newly reelected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and discussed the potential of approving the sale of new US fighter jets if Turkey drops its objections to Sweden joining NATO.

However, Blinken said the two issues are viewed as separate by the administration.

“From our perspective, we believe that both should go forward and should go forward as quickly as possible — that is to say, Sweden's accession — and we'll move forward on the F-16 package,” Blinken said.

The secretary of state also said that it was “appropriate” that every member have its say on the accession of new members into the alliance.

“Each member is making a solemn commitment to every other member that it will join in coming to their defense if they are the victims of aggression, and so it's important that every member have its say in this process,” he said.""",False,1685476149.0,t3_13vfxxm,t3_13vfxxm,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

The goal of Putinist propaganda is not to convice everyone about some absolute truth, but rather to blur the line between fiction and reality, between the plausible and implausible, between honesty and lies, and so on.  
In the eyes of the propagandists, the perfect citizen is the one who reacts to all the bullshit by saying ""I don't really know what to believe, it's all so confusing"".  


That might work as long as the trouble is somewhere else. You can afford to just ignore it and let the Kremlin do its thing. (Having riot police regularly beating protesters to a pulp also helps to reinforce this sentiment, of course)

👉 After the failure of the missile blitzkrieg in winter and early spring, when the Russians unsuccessfully tried to destroy Ukraine's energy infrastructure and sow panic among society, the aggressor state changed its tactics.

📌 Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, told about this in an interview with Online.ua .

""The tactics of missile strikes [of the Russians] have changed. For the most part, it is aimed at complicating or disrupting the plans of the Ukrainian Security and Defense Forces regarding the further liberation of the occupied territories,"" Yusov explained, adding that the defeat of Kyiv remains a priority for terrorist Moscow.

""Kyiv, which is resisting, which drove away the newest horde, remains an unconquered target for the aggressor. That's why the danger remains,"" emphasized the representative of military intelligence of Ukraine.

☝️ At the same time, Andriy Yusov emphasized that the successful mastering by the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the air defense equipment provided by the Western partners effectively neutralizes another missile attack by the Russians.

""The enemy would like to show that their ""analogovnet"" weapons can do something to the Ukrainian army and Western weapons. But it turns out not. How many shots in a row - in fact, all targets are missed. Our fighters, the Air Force, and air defense equipment are showing the best results,"" Yusov said.

☑️ According to him, the aggressor is using the next wave of missile terror for demonstrative propaganda about alleged damage to samples of Western weapons.

""The attempt is active, massive, unprecedented, but to a large extent, these are demonstrative performances. The Russians will not be able to repeat such performances so often and with the same intensity and number,"" - concluded the representative of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

""Ukraine does have the legitimate right to defend itself. It has the legitimate right to do so within its own borders, of course, but it does also have the right to project force beyond its borders to undermine Russia’s ability to project force into Ukraine itself,"" Cleverly told reporters after a joint news conference with Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. ""So legitimate military targets beyond its own border are part of Ukraine’s self-defense. And we should recognize that,"" he added.

Cleverly said he does not have any assessment over the drone attacks in Moscow on Tuesday, and he was referring to military targets more broadly beyond borders that are ""internationally recognized as being legitimate as part of a nation’s self-defense.""

EDIT: Vlad Vexler is a Russian-British philosopher, very insightful, very pro-Ukraine. His main take in this video, my interpretation at least, is: If you think it’s a false flag, that’s a mistake that is increasing difficult to accept as innocent. This will continue to happen, and expand in scope and impact. Russia is doing far worse. It’s unhelpful to hark about how morally wrong it might be to send drones against Moscow. Ukraine is fighting an existential and defensive war and they want it to increasingly be fought on Russian territory. Kremlin is currently playing it down but that could change - and we should expect some nuke threats from the propagandists. On the streets of Moscow, most people are probably still depoliticized and waiting to see what this all means while their gov and media tell them everything is under control.

>1. Losses Incurred by the Ukrainian Armed Forces: Over the past month, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have suffered significant losses, including more than 16,000 military personnel, 16 aircraft, 466 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and over 400 tanks and armored combat vehicles.

>2. Western Sponsors' Demands on Ukraine: Despite the considerable losses suffered by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Western sponsors are pressuring Kiev to initiate an offensive. It is alarming that the Ukrainian authorities are utilizing NATO weaponry to strike civilian targets and carry out acts of terrorism against peaceful Russian citizens.

>3. Interception of Long-Range Missiles: Russian forces have successfully intercepted 29 Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles in the past month. Additionally, 196 HIMARS missiles and 16 HARM missiles have been neutralized.

>4. Destruction of Targets in Kiev and Surrounding Areas: The Ukrainian ""Patriot"" air defense system has been rendered ineffective once again. In recent days, significant weapons depots in Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, and Mykolaiv have also been destroyed.

>5. Advancements in Aviation Tactics: The Russian Armed Forces are continually enhancing the application of aviation in their special operations. They are also mastering new equipment and means of engagement.

>6. Monitoring and Counterattacks: Russian forces are actively monitoring the supply routes of Western weapons to Ukraine and launching strikes against them.

>7. Enhancing Flight Safety: Ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of flights have led to a significant reduction in accidents caused by human factors within the Russian Armed Forces.",False,1685443247.0,t3_13vfxxm,t3_13vfxxm,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

First, let Ukraine run the best possible counteroffensive, then tell Russia that they have lost, and have X weeks to get out of Ukraine before it joins NATO.  After that deadline, any remaining Russian forces deal with NATO directly.

Russia is done, but they are going to drag this out as long as they can.  NATO needs to park a shitload of assets around Ukraine and just call it. Russia will whine and cry, but as long as the action remains in Ukraine and the deadline is only about Ukrainian borders, the likely result is actually deescalation.  Russia knows its remaining forces will get demolished by the West, which is why they don't mess with other NATO countries.

Sure, there's the internal voting issues of Hungary and maybe Turkey.  Worst case is that it's a coalition of mostly-NATO countries rather than NATO itself.  

But the cost for this action will probably be even cheaper than continued arms and financial support, and the world economy will benefit hugely from this bullshit invasion being over with.  The fact that one of the biggest NATO air exercises in history is already scheduled for June means that a lot of the assets are already in place to do this.

Ваше завдання буде не з легких. Ваш ворог добре навчений, оснащений і загартований у боях. Він буде жорстоко битися.

That's my concern if this ends up being Ukraine. We're heavily relying on Western support and as much as I would love to see Ukraine bring this war to Russia (and not against civilians), would be a heavy cost if it meant losing that support.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, we have no idea what's discussed outside of the public view, but public perception is also important and can't imagine US being happy anything being used could strike civilian infrastructure.

The goal being, to make the Russian populace feel the war, which is why Moscow would be the target, that where opinion matters. Secondly it serves the purpose of drawing Russian resources away from the front and potential counter offensive. Like the raids it serves to take Russia's focus off of where Ukraine is focusing. And helps spread out Russian air-d over Ukraine which takes the weight off the Ukrainian AF and will make any F-16 suppression of air-d that little bit easier if they try.

Of course, it _didn't work_ far more often than it did, bombing Kyiv to mush is clearly not on the table either.

So far RF military tactics appear to primarily involve a bunch of unrelated platoons not communicating anything they learned in the hope the other platoons eat the ambushes, (between PMCs and MOD's forces, but even between a single entity's troops too) and even if they do know, fuck it, continue with the failing tactics anyway.

I guess that includes wasting your rapidly dwindling supply and tiny lines of resupply for drones and bombs on hitting military irrelevant targets that are capable of shooting down most of what you throw at it.

There's more than that though. Many comparisons were drawn between Russia's missile tantrums and V-2 rockets tossed over the English Channel in WW2, which did far more to galvanize the UK war effort than it did to scare the British people into pulling back. If Ukraine begins long-range drone attacks on Moscow, the same comparisons arise.

> unhelpful

If you think the problem is the people in this thread not reaching a consensus on something, you're missing the point. There are active movements in Western countries right now to try to kill aid to Ukraine, and they will take anything they can get their hands on to either character-assassinate Ukraine or defend Russian behavior. Certainly, that's not fair to Ukraine - but fighting this war isn't about fairness, it's about practical realities.

The concern here isn't about morals - it's about what is and isn't smart with respect to winning the war, and that includes impacts to Putin's ability to mobilize further and/or impacts to military provisions from abroad. Even if it's not a false flag, that doesn't necessarily make it a _good idea_.",1685486554.0,1685486335.0,t3_13vfxxm,t1_jm97dpq,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Thus, they are not capable of defending the entirety of a counties air space due to the number of systems required to do so.  Instead they are placed so as to defend specific targets.  With mid to high altitude SAM systems, like the Russian S-300 and S-400, protecting against aircraft and ballistic missile type threats.  While, systems like the Russian Pantsir, will protect against low flying drones and cruise missiles.  The Pantsir system is what was seen engaging the drones over Moscow.

Low flying drones and cruise missiles are particularly difficult to detect.  This is due the low altitude they fly at, as it reduces its detection range against air defense radars.

The type of drone reported to be used was most likely INS+GPS guided.  Thus, a flight path is set prior to the drone being launched.  This enables the strike path to be planned around enemy air defense.  This type of GPS guidance is also vulnerable to Russian Electronic Warfare jamming, which has proven to be very effective during this war.

Air defense is very expensive and you need a lot of it to adequately cover an area. If someone launched 50 shahed drones at Chicago I think a lot may actually hit their targets.

Ordinarily you'd expect the UK to give nowhere *near* 50% of stockpiles.  The thing that complicated Storm Shadows is that the UK intends to replace them before too long and has other overlapping capabilities.

> has used roughly 40-50 Storm Shadows out of a total estimate of 800 UK stockpile

Or about 1.5% per week of burn.  You can do that for awhile.

But in any case: IMO, the principal benefit of something like Storm Shadow is not the damage that it can do, but the way that it constrains enemy actions and logistics.  They have to believe you might launch frequently and not just nibble here and there for that to work, though.

Next up as the counteroffensive really kicks off is GLSDB, launching volleys of 6 individually targetable 100 kilogram munitions from nimble HIMARS launchers.

GLSDB  doesn't have quite the ""reach out and touch you"" capability of SS with a range of ""only"" 150km, but boy we should be able to give a lot.  Cost per volley is probably about 1/10th of a Storm Shadow launch.  It's a similar quantity of explosive per volley.

Our air offensive has severely reduced their air power and their ability to wage war on the ground.  Our home fronts have provided us with an overwhelming advantage in military weapons and ammunition and have placed at our disposal large reserves of trained fighting men.  The tide has turned.

What seems likely is that Ukraine would not purposefully target civilians, but if these drones were shot down or jammed electronically then they have to crash somewhere, and the forest south west of Moscow that happens to contain the really exclusive neighborhoods is also the most likely crash zone on the presumed flight path.

The gains for Ukraine even from a failure to hit the intended military targets are still there. There's a psychological advantage to the citizens of Moscow no longer feeling safe and isolated from the war, and it potentially has a huge impact on the willingness of third countries to send airliners into Moscow airspace, which hurts Russia more than the third countries.

Ukraine striking back at longer range shows the world that they can do that too, challenging Russia's stance that they can attack an enemy capitol with no consequence.

2: a deterrent to Russia. Timing future drone strikes against Russia's missile and drone attacks on kyiv will help knock down the willingness of Russia to strike civilian targets in Ukraine.

Given everyone knows, in general terms, that an offensive is coming, logically it makes sense for Ukraine to try to make high profile announcements to trigger russia going to maximum readiness- things like bringing troops back to the line, restocking ammo depots, concentrating mobile reaction forces, there is operational value to that for Ukraine- they get to see what the russian dispositions are like, have more targets for missile strikes and also just leave the defenders dangling- there's only so long people can remain on alert before their attention starts to drop off again.

By the same token, there is a limited time Ukraine can remain ready to go. Their brigades are presumably going to remain as dispersed as possible until the last possible minute to avoid offering a target for russian missiles and avoid making their intentions clear. Once they concentrate, they pretty much need to start the attack immediately to achieve at least local surprise, and avoid offering a juicy target for artillery or missiles. There's only so long a brigade sized force can remain in a staging area before its own effectiveness starts to degrade, bearing in mind troops need to be fed, vehicles need to be fueled (and moved around to avoid being located and fired on.)

My guess is they'll might wait a few more days or a week, even do a few more 'psyche' announcements from Zaluzhny or Zelensky to keep the russians guessing and make them start to wonder if it is happening at all, and then it will be on for real.

Russia will be infuriated by the loss of ground and will throw everything they have to reconquer it.

I dislike the Russians as much as the next guy, but the human wave myth needs to die. They operated on pretty much the same set of principles as anyone else. Create or exploit a weak point in the enemy lines then push through as many divisions as possible and race toward the enemy rear. This was their doctrine. (GS Isserson's ""On the Evolution of the Operational Art"" is a great read on the subject since it was a foundational work in Soviet military doctrine.) From 1943 on they rode roughshod over German formations. I mean, Operation Bagration wiped Army Group Center off the face of the eaerth. 

Yes they incurred horrendous casualties along the way, but why is that surprising? How? Germany had, even toward the end, one of the best armies in the world. From 1939-1941 they stood astride the world like a mighty colossus. They had good equipment, a decently competent officer corps, plenty of solid infantry, and, initially, a tactical and operational superiority over the USSR. Why are we surprised that the Soviets suffered such horrendous casualties? While Germany stood astride the world like that great colossus, the Russians were a half-lobotomized colossus with okay equipment, a beheaded officer corps, political commissars influencing unit activities, an unruly mob of poorly trained conscripts and, initially, no significant tactical or operational experience against a Western power, and were caught in the middle of a doctrinal shift from the Deep Operation back to pre-1930s bullshit then back to Deep Operation. But that glaring dichotomy is somehow completely ignored.

I don’t think that’s true at all. A full mobilization won’t benefit Russia and they don’t need a false flag to do it. A full mobilization much more likely to turn people against Russia regardless of reason. Second, even fully mobilizing doesn’t give them what they need in terms of supplies or training.
