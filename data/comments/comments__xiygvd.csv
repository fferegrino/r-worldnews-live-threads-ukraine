- The command of Russia's Black Sea Fleet has almost certainly relocated its KILO-class submarines from their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea to Novorossiysk in Krasnodar Krai, southern Russia.

- This is highly likely due to the recent change in the local security threat level in the face of increased Ukrainian long-range strike capability. In the last two months, the fleet headquarters and its main naval aviation airfield have been attacked.

- Guaranteeing the Black Sea Fleet's Crimea basing was likely one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's motivations for annexing the peninsula in 2014. Base security has now been directly undermined by Russia's continued aggression against Ukraine.

Day 209 of my updates from Kharkiv.

They’ve fired an absolute shit ton of missiles at us today, at the very least 12, but most likely far more, even up to 20. They have been launching missiles all throughout the day, some during the day, which is why they are hard to count, they are almost impossible to see against the blue sky. Some missiles were aimed to destroy the dam at Pechenihy reservoir, just east of Kharkiv, bastards are trying to flood us.

Then they started launching missiles at 1:10am, it looks like there were seven in total. We don’t know where they landed, there were reports of explosions in Kharkiv oblast, but we couldn’t hear them from the city, they might have been aimed at the dam again, but we don’t know for sure yet.

At 1:50am a series of extremely loud explosions happened in Kharkiv, there were no prior messages about missiles being fired, so they were very sudden. Those bastards hit a 12-story apartment building in Kholodna Hora district. They hit it directly in the roof, completely destroying the last floor, damaging at least a couple more floors, and breaking all the windows in the building. 

We don’t know if there are any casualties yet, but some people are trapped under the rubble, and being rescued right now. That building is full of people, photos and videos show that the lights are on in at least half of the apartments, even directly under the place where the missile hit. Literally a chunk of the roof is gone, and right under that hole there’s light in an apartment. Those fucking terrorists are trying to kill civilians with everything they have.",1663719733.0,1663719578.0,t3_xiygvd,t3_xiygvd,,0,177,0,177,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

> The great transition of power in Russia is
getting closer and the main actors
are actively involved in its preparation.
While Russian President Vladimir
Putin is busy interpreting the
interpretations of the two main
questions “Who is to blame?” and “what to do?”,
Secretary of the Russian Security
Council Nikolai Patrushev went to
China, preparing the ground for transit,
to enlist the support of the Chinese
leadership.
Patrushev presented to the Chinese
comrades the prospects and contours
of Russia's foreign and
domestic policy after his son Dmitry
Patrushev becomes president. The Secretary
of the Security Council
conveyed promises from his son
and his own guarantees that the
Russian leadership, headed by Dmitry,
would be a loyal ally of China,
and that all agreements would be
unconditionally respected. Moreover, Patrushev
made several proposals regarding
the joint use of Russian natural
resources and the economic
development of the two countries.
There were many promises and assurances
from the Secretary of the
Security Council, to which the Chinese
colleagues, after listening
carefully, said that time was needed
for reflection, and that was the
decision. There was no talk of any
requests to help Russia with weapons or
goods for the military
industry at Patrushev's meeting
with representatives of the Chinese
leadership. Through diplomatic
channels, the Russian leadership
was informed that it was
undesirable to discuss this
topic during Patrushev's visit to China.
Chinese counterparts asked Nikolai
Patrushev how his son was going to
end the war in Ukraine, to which the
Secretary of the Security Council replied
that the war would be over before his
son Dmitry became president.
Dmitry Patrushev himself is preparing
for transit no less than his father.
Dmitry has already visited the leadership
of the main confessions in Russia and
secured partly with the approval of plans,
and partly with a blessing for the reign.
The main meme among Dmitry
Patrushev's friends and relatives is his
frequently repeated phrase-quote from
Sivenson's Treasure Island: “I'm

It does not solve short- and medium-term equipment shortages, nor the problem that the force structure of the Russian Armed Forces is ill-fitted for mass conscription (unlike the old Soviet Armed Forces), nor the shortage of training staff for new conscripts since regular units are in Ukraine and elite forces are disproportionately on Ukrainian soil (or beneath it.) The forced abduction of talented personnel also makes worse Russia's catastrophic economic and fiscal crisis, (today Putin announced increased taxation on oil and gas companies to fill a hole of around $50 billion) and the fact that MOBILISATION IS HUGELY UNPOPULAR. 

This last point is huge. Even on censored message boards where Ukrainians are called Nazis, mobilisation is about as popular as kicking a corgi to death. This is a country, remember, that couldn't even be mobilised to get the vaccine. The number of vaccinated in Russia is around 50%. The USA is over 85%.

The question when it comes to mobilisation is throughput, and throughput is going to be small, in the very low thousands for the first few months, only crossing ten thousand per month next year.

Desire to Mobilize: Ethnically Russian people have yet to really fight in this war. They won't like dying and their families will like it less. This action will galvanize the anti-war movement in Russia and give them a lot more clout. There will be more and louder calls for leadership change and more anti-war activities carried out.

Proper training takes months. Russia has weeks before further collapse in Kherson and Luhansk Regions. Recent prisoner soldiers had 1 week training. Held a gun once and didn't have any ammo to fire.

Supply and Logistics. There is no equipment for the conscripts to use. The prisoner soldiers had almost no combat fatigues. There were only ~1000. LPR/DPR soldiers are using rifles manufactured in 1897. This week Russia pulled SAM batteries from St Petersburg and Finnish border to go to the frontlines. A couple of weeks ago they recommissioned artillery that was last manufactured in 1957 and decommissioned in the 80's and was being used as avalanche clearing. They've asked North Korea for ammo, Iran for weapons and pulled all resources from Tajikistan. There is no equipment for 100k surplus troops. They won't even have enough combat fatigues imo. ADDITIONALLY, you need to feed and transport all these people. Russia has shown that their logistics game is a nightmare. This is another problem which they will fail to address.

All told, they may mobilize, but doing so is unlikely to change the outcome of the war beyond adding thousands of more casualties to the Russian side as Ukraine will not struggle to defeat unmotivated, poorly equipped, starving men with no training.",False,1663683207.0,t3_xiygvd,t3_xiygvd,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

We talked about his family, what he thought of the US coming here - just getting his vibe. He has several children and described how he traveled to their sporting events: a seemingly interested and committed father. One of our last convos was his passionate position that anyone who resides here and dares talk crap about their country should get a reality check of what others go through in other countries. He was pretty passionate about how much the US has to offer compared to where he came from.

A country so large is going to have issues when conscripts from areas like Vladivostok are pulled to fight a war on the other side of the continent. Any communication with home will likely be rife with conversation of an imploding economy.

Multiply this by the millions of affected Russians and now you have armed and trained (even if poorly) soldiers with little motivation to fight Ukraine and a first hand seat to the reality of the war not obscured by state TV.

That's the ingredients for civil issues at the very least, topping out at a civil war.

Now the part that worries me is that we don't have a smooth coup but rather regional breakouts like Chechnya, were looking at an interesting equation with Russia's nuclear arsenal.

Russia's key problem at this moment is that it is running out of people stupid enough to volunteer to be HIMARS targets.   General mobilization would solve that, but it comes at a huge social, economic and military price.    But they don't need general mobilization...  At least not yet.

The first step is annexation of territory.  At which point it is legal for Russia to deploy conscript soldiers to that territory.  It doesn't really matter what the rest of the world thinks, for the purposes of getting meat into the theatre, as long as no Russian can claim in Russia that it's illegal, then it's legal.  Done.

Since they have several hundred thousand conscripts already on payroll, already being fed and being (cough) ""trained"", they can at least throw more meat into the grinder without increasing their logistics and training burden.  Whether this meat is *effective* or not is another matter.  

Presto:  Russia's immediate meat shortage in Ukraine is solved, without significantly changing Russia's legal framework. 

A second problem is production of materials.  That's more tricky because if they add 2X the number of soldiers to the front, they're going to have to find some way to send 2x the ammunition, food, fuel, etc... and winter is coming.    So they need to mobilize *production*.  That needs factories on a wartime footing.  Which could be spun positively as jobs for everyone, but not ""mobilization""...  

Ultimately if (when)  the conscript forces are defeated, then it will have been by attack on Russia, and that will justify mobilization.",False,1663712523.0,t3_xiygvd,t3_xiygvd,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

The first is young people aged 22 to 26 who have recently completed military service, as well as reserve officers of the necessary military specialties (artillerymen, tankmen, scouts, marines, paratroopers, special forces, pilots, air defense, missilemen). The first wave may begin immediately after martial law is declared in the Russian Federation, that is, already in mid-October.

They plan to send recruits to the occupied territories after a month or a three-week training course to strengthen the defense. There are no recruitment indicators yet, but, according to the military, we are talking about 55-70 thousand people.

The second group of conscripts of the first wave is 27-35 years old, who have completed military service or have contract service experience. There are also no recruitment figures yet, but according to military estimates, from 250 to 300 thousand people should be put under arms. Due to the lack of training camps, instructors and equipment, the recruitment will not be carried out at once, but in waves over three months.

Recruits from the second group are planned to be driven through a three-month training course and sent to the combat zone as soon as they are ready. That is, the first replenishment from this group will reach Ukraine in late December - mid-January.

In the spring, if necessary, the older ages (over 35 years old) will go, followed by the younger ones.

Russia's military is about 100 times larger than Germany's as of 2021.

Russia and Germany both spent about 50 Billion dollars on their Military each year for the past couple years. It peaked at 80 billion but rose there from the low 10's.

What do you think is going to happen when Russia pulls these thousands of reserves from mothballs after they've sat there for decades having most likely never been serviced.

Keeping in mind that we haven't even addressed the massive corruption that sees part of the Russian military budget being funneled to people's pockets.

If you want to know why Russia has been faceplanting so hard during this conflict they should have won easily, here's your answer. Their corruption and spending policies have fucked them hard and there's no way to fix it, even with overwhelming manpower. WW2 was easy because weapons were simple by comparison. This is the modern age. The 90's proved that a simple RPG could stop a Russia T-62, T-64, T-72 without a second thought.

- salt the potatoes during the cooking as opposed to after (potatoes *love* salt)

- halving the carrots is fine, just cut 'em thin... No need to quarter them.

- chopping the garlic and then crushing it will deliver, no need to take the time to dice it (RIP knife handle, real cooks don't need 'em anyway)

- we're cooking some items separately.  Potatoes are done and moving on, we're gonna set them aside so they don't mash.  Next up: carrots.  They're going on first because they'll take longer to cook - shortly followed by the onions and garlic.  We're looking for a little bit of caramelization which is a sign that the cooking process is breaking down larger sugars into simpler ones - which are *delicious*.

- cabbage.  Somewhat tricky, but quick, high heat and a bit of technical know-how learned from experience and perfection can be achieved.  The issue with cabbage can come from *over* cooking it as doing so will produce sulfurs.  Looks like dude is *nailing* it.

- what's that vegetable?  Cucumber?  Zucchini?  Can't tell, but it's cut nicely.

- mushrooms.  The often forgotten umami that will bring a fullness to the pallet of many savory dishes.  Seriously, next time you're cooking burgers in your cast iron, toss some on with the patties - if you're grilling, throw them on the grill (whole), upside down and don't take them off until the end of their stem starts to sweat heavily. ... You're welcome.

- herbs.  Some fresh (or dried, for that matter) herbs go a long way.  Regrettably, I can't identify the herb in the video (I could tell you what it's *not*, though) but that's kind of a moot point because the fullness an herb will bring is priceless.  Granted, a mispaired herb can ruin a dish (experience on my part with fresh thyme and dill, but this guy looks like he knows what he's doing - *I want to know that herb!*)

- some corn and peas near the end of it.  *More* flavor and more to sink your teeth into.  I'm onboard.

Now, here's the kicker.  After watching this I'm hungry, and I'd imagine you're not that far away from that yourself.  **But**, do you realize that a *vegetarian* dish just did that to you?  No meat!  How frikkin cool is that?

I mean, meat is a tricky thing when you're not next to a refrigerator.  (Granted, iirc, the Tartars used to preserve meat with copious amounts of raw garlic and eat it raw, too - but I digress).  ... My point is that this guy just pulled off a high calorie, observably delicious, *filing* dish without needing a single bit of meat.

I think that this evening I'm going to take a shot at something similar (up through the potatoes, carrots, onions, and garlic) because that's what I have on hand (no cabbage in house - and I still want to know the mystery veggie, although I might be able to make some of the frozen broccoli and cauliflower I have on hand work ... regardless).

They might not immediately be up to the same tactical standards of an american pilot after graduating from the full flight school program, but they don't really need to be to utilize the main feature that an F-16 would give them: the ability to fire U.S. long distance air to air missiles. If you take an F-16, change all the lables to Ukranian in the cockpit, your average Ukranian Mig-29 pilot will be able to immediately fly it at a basic level. The stick, throttles, rudder pedals, basic gauges, etc. all work largely the same. The mechanics of flying a fighter, with some airframe specific quirks are largely the same. Take that same pilot and give them a couple months intensive training on how to use the U.S. weapon systems, sensors and maybe some general F-16 specific tactics and general theory, and they would be pretty easily operational. The much bigger hurdle is going to be training maintenance staff how to care for, maintain and repair an F-16. Especially the computerized components. I don't see an easy way to expedite that training and U.S. jet engines in particular have very much different maintenance procedures and requirements than Soviet era jet engines did. I see that, and upgrading the service bays to even handle an F-16 as being the two biggest hurdles to realistically deploying them to Ukraine. It might literally be easier to try and fit a U.S. missile system and radar to a Mig, similar but much more involved than what they did to fit HARM missiles on them already than trying to upgrade the Ukraine airforce to deal with NATO jets during a war. And if you want to train those pilots and maintenance people, they can't be training and simultaneously fighting on the front lines. So you are probably looking at new recruits with some pilot or maintenance aptitude who can be spared, sent over to be trained for a 6 month to 1 year period where they are not available for combat operations, and then 13 months from when you start, you have the first of those new air assets available for use in combat.",False,1663689188.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip75tad,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Tyres is the obvious answer. Many tyre brands had factories there, like Pirelli, that were developing and manufacturing tyres for the rest of the world. Half decent, too.

They also had until this war a relatively good domestic wristwatch industry, at one point Soviet wristwatches were actually quite excellent, possibly second only to the Swiss, although the watchmaking industry was much reduced post quartz watches, losing out, like almost every nation, to Japan. However, the big surviving player, Vostok (the Chistopol Watch Factory, technically) traded mostly on the fact that it still produced the vintage Amphibia and Komandirskie designs, which were like buying a 1960s mechanical watch, but brand new, and at a very competitive price - well under a hundred dollars, so a lot of watch for not much money. Watch nerds generally either loved or hated them but they were an excellent entry into mechanical watches or vintage watches. Compared to a 60s reissue from a Swiss brand being less authentic and also many thousands of dollars, Vostok watches sold really quite well and were completely made down to the last component in one factory in Russia, a level of ""in house"" (to use the watchmaking term) or ""vertically integrated"" (in more general terms) manufacturing which even many Swiss companies do not achieve.

Also, vacuum tubes for audio use. Anyone who is into tube amps will tell you the *only* decent modern tubes available were the Russian ones. Basically three countries made them: China (modern tooling, generally garbage), Slovakia (good tubes but often too delicate and short lived when used in Vox/Marshall type circuits that hammer the power tubes and not all that consistent, quality control hit and miss), and Russia, who built tubes that were actually an improvement upon old-stock tubes and could take the abuse that old British Mullards could, whilst delivering consistent sonic performance and high standards of construction.

If Russia annex LPR/DPR, then it opens the door for mobilization. But it's not guaranteed either. It just give them the opportunity to call for mobilization if they really decide it can be done.

Russia has four issues right now that underpin the failures it's experienced in Ukraine:

1. Manpower

2. Equipment

3. Logistics

4. Command and discipline.

Mobilisation addresses issue 1. However, it puts huge additional pressure on issue 2 which is that despite Russia having huge stockpiles, most of it is stored so badly that it's unserviceable. Their equipment reserves basically only exist on paper because they've not been maintained since 1991.

It also strains issue 3, because Russian logistics are already struggling to supply the current size of force on the frontline. Unless the aim is a human wave with no resupply, adding more troops to the mix will just make failing logistics collapse further. Entire divisions will be overrun by Ukraine simply because they have nothing left with which to shoot.

Finally, mobilisation will descend into chaos because of issue 4. Russian command structures are a joke, they were obsolete during the Napoleonic Wars 200 years ago. Absolute top-down rigid command structures with non-negotiable implementation and a lack of an NCO corps to translate high-level orders into low-level actions are something everyone else has consigned to the depths of history. The other issue with a huge void between the officers and soldiers is that discipline is near impossible, the officers do not have enough numbers or power to enforce discipline themselves and rely on troops being responsible for their own collective discipline. That works if and only if you have a well trained, loyal, possibly even brainwashed army. Russia does not. It has a disorganised rabble of young boys who don't even know how to look after their basic needs, and commit atrocities whilst on the brink of survival like animals, because that's how they're treated.

So yeah. Mobilisation is a huge mistake for Russia because it follows a school of thought that died out two centuries ago. Which is exactly why it's inevitable they'll try it.",False,1663705708.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip8o10y,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Russia is playing a deliberate game here, which is for the consumption of Russians in Russia, namely that it's threatening to declare the areas of Ukraine it controls to be officially Russian not just occupied by Russia.

The mad influx of posting is because this truthfully does represent a step change in Russian attitude and it's clear that it must have a specific and definite purpose. Otherwise, why now and not in March?

Therefore, everyone is getting very excitable speculating what it could be. The truth is that we don't know.

It could be as simple as allowing Russia to legally deploy conscripted soldiers to the front lines, and whilst people might ask ""since when does Russia care about legality"" some of these things it still does properly and by the book to prevent giving detractors too easy an attack.

The frenzy is because it could also be used to justify mobilization as Ukraine would be moving onto ""Russian"" soil. It could also be used to ""justify"" a tactical nuclear strike in the region as Russian doctrine permits a first strike in the defence of Russian soil.

Of course, none of these are actually sensible options for Russia.

it doesn't mean Russia will send a larger percentage of their army to Ukraine. they already have their entire army (minus a few border garrisons) in Ukraine.

They really don’t have much more they *can* commit to fighting Ukraine. The overwhelming majority of their ground combat forces are already there. They’re barely able to defend their borders as it is, though they don’t really need to worry about that thanks to their nuclear arsenal.

Mobilization is about calling up their reservists—something different from what this would mean in the West—and conscripting fresh personnel. These people will need training to be even remotely effective in combat, which takes time. They’ll need equipment, the best of which Russia has already burned through.

Even if they accomplish all of this in a timely manner, throwing tens of thousands of conscripts into the fray will merely worsen their logistics situation and produce atrocious casualties likely to spark anti-war sentiment on the home front.

It's hard to put up a credible defense when you're surrounded, out of fuel and food, and didn't have many bullets to start with. So many of these units which were in theory Russia's best trained and equipped had to surrender immediately, without even being able to put up more than a token resistance.

Putin is too far gone to imperialistic fantasy. He hasn't wavered on insisting on his version of reality.

> Up until now NATO hasn't had to seriously consider whether or not they want to risk an all out war to protect Ukraine. If Putin really does raise the stakes and go all in, there's a good chance the west will have to choose the lesser evil.

Absolute tripe.  NATO were fully expecting a general mobilisation to be announced back at the Victory Day parade in May.

Instead, at every turn, he has opted to deescalate, to paint the losses as either purely accidental or a deliberate Russian decision.

Chances of Ukraine surviving: close to 100%.

In all seriousness if Russia belives that mobilization actually helps them they've got a few problems (1) Russia is losing now, not 6 - 12 months from now; and (2) Russia has shown that they cannot reliable feed cloth and arm 200,000+ soldiers in Ukraine, while Ukraine has shown they can reliable whip less than 200,000 Russian soldiers.

Likely, putting large number of conscripts in the field just slows the war down.  Allows Russia to create defensive lines in depth, which they don't currently appear to have.

For starters it has already sent a lot of trainers and the like to fight in Ukraine when it was pulling forces from wherever it could. Meaning Russia has less personnel available to help train new conscripts.

They could theoretically send them early, but that's nothing short of suicide by proxy. 

Another problem is that Russia's supply network can already barely support the current amount of soldiers, and more than likely can't consistently. More soldiers is only going to make the supply issue vastly worse.

Aside from that there's the simple issue that merely more infantry isn't going to do a whole lot by itself. And Russia doesn't really have the resources left for anything other than infantry in such masses.

Yeah maybe they could now have more units to throw at fortifications or to hold controlled territory. Which might create some more pressure. For a while. But this number increase would inevitably be reduced again because the Russians will just spend those lives pointlessly with very high attritional fights and tactics.

To put it simply, mobilization is very far from an instant win button for Russia.

Some examples:

+ Standard issue infantry rifle: Kar98k vs MN91/30 - both were 5 round bolt action rifles with similar handling characteristics. Balanced, no advantage either way. Saying that, the USSR had high levels of automatic fire at the squad-level by 1943, with entire assault divisions equipped with PPSh-41 and PPS-42 SMGs. At no point was Wehrmacht SMG issue anywhere near that level of prevalence, and even with the late war introduction of magazine fed select-fire rifles like the MP-44/StG-44 or the Volkssturmgewehr, they never achieved the same quantities as the USSR fielded.

+ Typical fighter aircraft: Bf-109G vs Yak-3. Similar performance, possibly even advantage USSR. The German fighters were flown by better trained pilots with arguably better handling aircraft and more no-nonsense tactics (the USSR persevered with the idea of accurate-shooting a single (or pair of) high-calibre cannon with a low rate of fire *way* too long into the war, where peers like the US recognised that a bank of a dozen rapid-firing 50-cals was *way* more effective than a single 20mm cannon), but the Russian designs won out on maintenance.

+ Typical battle tank: Pz. V ""Panther"" vs T-34-85. Similar performance again, advantage Germany on quality, advantage USSR on numbers.

Compare that kind of conflict, where the USSR was fielding like-for-like or better equipment in *serious number advantage* and yet still took 10m losses to the Germans 5m on *all* fronts, to today where Russia fields 1960s kit against the Ukrainians who have 21st century gear. Wave tactics don't work well. They only got away with it in 1944/45 because they had the huge rural population to burn compared to Germany. They don't have that now.

Russian losses then were easily 3:1 or 4:1. They're at least 10:1 now with current tactics from both sides. If they go full human wave, this is going to turn into an outright Russian massacre.",False,1663698826.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip860yk,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

For example, multi-role functionality.    The Russians, though they have made a glacial shift away from it, have definitive breakdowns in who does what in their doctrine.   Fighter pilots fight, bomber pilots bomb, and tactical strike aircraft strike.  Their pilots are trained in that fashion, and the planes are designed around that, including avionics, munitions and mechanicals.  In NATO, completely not the case.   NATO emphasizes that their planes pilots be able to perform multiple roles in that 'fewer but smarter' setup, as required by the tempo and requirements of the ground war.   You might be set up for aerial dominance for one day, then spend the next 3 doing ground support, then back to AD again.   NATO-standard planes like the F-16 have been built for this task, and so has the training of all the pilots around it.

That means your pilot has to be able to handle the low-and-slow mission of tactical support just as well as the boom-and-zoom missions.  He or she needs to know how to swap the various built-in systems that were designed to work across the various modes that NATO demands their pilots be able to handle - especially if he or she is on call to hold station and react on request.  And that's not counting figuring out how these calls are going to be made, who will be giving them, and how they will communicate and work with other groups.

Could you get around it by declaring it fine that your pilot doesn't know how to switch between roles during the flight, or other tasks that need to be performed by a pilot in that new situation?  Probably.   You might even get away with flying it the way you handled your MiG-29 or Su-27.   People can say 'Oh, they're smart, they'll figure it out' all they want.

Hence the entire 'special operation' thing.  War and mobilization has to be built up to, like the adage of boiling a frog by slowly raising its temperature (not true, but useful).  Even among older Russians who worship Putin war would be a dirty word.  They have to believe whatever they're sanctioning is a means of *preventing* war.  So police, mercs, reservists, they're prepared to swallow that inch by inch.  

The young people in Russia are less like western revolutionary youth groups and more like the youth in Iran.  They've lived with oppression all their lives and are not used to thinking for themselves.  They favor the status quo and retreat into apathy rather than action when conditions worsen.

Mostly because they haven't made many major gains. The only time they made big gains was at the start, which was when supply was an absolute mess. Their supply even with static fronts hasn't been stellar, but it's been serviceable. 

>The real question is how much equipment they have available to give these new recruits, how can they integrate them in units, do they have officers to lead them. And importantly how long will they train them, because the less time they give them to train the faster they will deploy, but also the more useless they'll be.

I agree on this. This is certainly the bigger concern for mobilization. It's also worth considering that they may lack even proper training equipment in the first place. 

>Russia may regain the advantage with mobilization, but they are behind on training and the boost may come too late.

“I think there will be partial mobilization. According to some reports, this may happen: 

According to our information, two groups will fall under mobilization in the first wave. The first is young people aged 22 to 26 who have recently completed military service, as well as reserve officers of the necessary military specialties (artillerymen, tankmen, scouts, marines, paratroopers, special forces, pilots, air defense, missilemen). The first wave may begin immediately after martial law is declared in the Russian Federation, that is, already in mid-October.

They plan to send recruits to the occupied territories after a month or a three-week training course to strengthen the defense. There are no recruitment indicators yet, but, according to the military, we are talking about 55-70 thousand people.

The second group of conscripts of the first wave is 27-35 years old, who have completed military service or have contract service experience. There are also no recruitment figures yet, but according to military estimates, from 250 to 300 thousand people should be put under arms. Due to the lack of training camps, instructors and equipment, the recruitment will not be carried out at once, but in waves over three months. 

Recruits from the second group are planned to be driven through a three-month training course and sent to the combat zone as soon as they are ready. That is, the first replenishment from this group will reach Ukraine in late December - mid-January.

In the spring, if necessary, the older ages (over 35 years old) will go, followed by the younger ones.

It's not like you can just parachute 100 Abrams tanks into Ukraine and walk away.  


My guess is that the training is being done to get Ukrainian crews ready and maintenance teams prepared as well as prepping the logistical chain needed to keep them in gear.  Also, as with other big systems, they will probably be deployed before we get the announcements that they are being sent.  That's a double punch to the Russians, as they won't have time to change there tactics, as much as they can, to deal with the new threats until they've been hit already.    


There's also the disinformation element of Ukraine asking for lots of things to make itself look weak.  Before the latest Kherson attack there were big rounds of that, to the point that many folks were saying that Ukraine was so under equipped it wouldn't be able to launch any attacks for the rest of the year.

>Navalny’s political fame rests primarily on his success as an anti-corruption activist — but he’s also made waves with his strident xenophobia. In one notorious 2007 video, he equates **Muslim militants with “cockroaches” that can only be dealt with by exterminating them**. In another from 2011, he depicts himself as an unapologetic nationalist who will deport non-White immigrants from Central Asia and the Caucasus by ruthlessly deporting them. There are other examples.

From the rferl source below:

>In one clip, Navalny is shown in a dentist's outfit as footage of migrants in Moscow is interspersed with his references to harmful tooth cavities. ""I recommend full sanitization,"" he says. ""Everything in our way should be carefully but decisively be removed through deportation.""

>Much of the attention focuses on Navalny's unabashed endorsement of nationalist causes in the late 2000s, including **his appearances at the Russian March, an annual event that gathers ultranationalists of all stripes in Moscow** but has dwindled in size in recent years.  
>  
>In response, the liberal Yabloko party expelled Navalny from its ranks, but under the banner of a new group called the National Russian Liberation Movement in 2007 he released YouTube videos describing himself as a ""certified nationalist"" and advancing thinly veiled xenophobia.

They're also evidence of continued metallurgical engineering work beyond simply making more of the same.

Old stock tubes that are really good, are better, but good luck getting hold of more than a matched pair of them, and when replacing don't expect the next matched pair to sound the same. There's also a lot of bad old stock tubes around too, and you won't know until you've bought them.

The Slovakian tubes, JJ, are good, but they're a small company suddenly handed a huge market, a victim of their own success which has meant some consistency issues. They're also much better with American circuit designs which have less aggressive bias voltages. However, most valve amp circuits are derived from Vox or Marshall designs, and for these the Russian tubes are generally better.

Basically one company controlled all Russian audio tube export - New Sensor Inc, the American company behind Electro Harmonix, the effects brand. They had a massive market share of tubes. With sanctions, no tubes from Russia.

The talk is that New Sensor / EHX will never restart production of tubes in Russia. This genuinely might be the beginning of the end for affordable valve amplifiers. There's a reason the likes of Fender have been pushing their ""valve emulation"" amps to the professional grade player, like the Fender Tone Master series. Incidentally the Russian tube industry was already floundering, even before Covid and well before the war, so it's not entirely without warning but the timescale has accelerated, a lot.",False,1663715800.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip9b5wd,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

2. The USSR included Ukrainians fighting on their side and by many accounts they were some of the best, most effective, and most professional fighters.

3. Lend lease made a huge difference. Even mid war Soviet designs for equipment used British or American R&D and lessons learned from loaner equipment. Look at how the Yak-3 changes from the Yak-1 and gets much more like a Spitfire or Hurricane, with wing-root guns, a bubble canopy, more rounded flight surfaces. Look at how late war trucks copy the American 6x6 design with long suspension travel and a very high front profile rather than being simply rear wheel drive and high clearance alone but on stiff leaf springs with a big low hanging bumper. Once the cold war hit they lost that finger on the pulse.

4. Dare I say it, some of the right minds in the right place at the right time, like Zhukov. In contrast, the main goal of Russian military leadership today is loyalty to the regime and actually being inept is a positive attribute because you're not viewed as a threat by the FSB.

The real reason why NATO has generally stuck to sending old Soviet material and comparatively simple weapons such as RPGs, ATGMs, MANPADS and infantry vehicles, is that otherwise Ukrainian logistics would have collapsed, not because of ""fear of escalation"". That is also why somewhat more complex weapons (HIMARS, long-range howitzers, Gepards) arrived only during the summer, after Ukrainian troops could get somewhat adequate training.

Listening to the latest sounds regarding Western main battle tanks, I guess Ukrainians have already been quietly training on those for a while, and deliveries will start once everything is ready for them.

bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,xiygvd,ip7jisu,"The answer is 'not as many as you would think'.    To rationalize how weapons and supplies are being shipped, you have to think of it in terms of moving things from one warehouse into another, with a limited number of trucks available.

We know that the source warehouse has a ton of stuff they can ship.   We know that the receiving warehouse has a ton of demands, but only so many hands available to unload trucks and move the stuff to where it needs to go.  In between those warehouses, you have a limited number of trucks you can actually load and move stock between the two warehouses that can only do so many runs a day.  And in that receiving warehouse, we know that there is a certain list of items they need to have on hand in order to sustain operations.

So - you know every day, you can only run, say, 6 trucks.  Of those 6 trucks, lets say 3 of them are going to be running those necessary supplies.   That leaves you 3 trucks left over for whatever else you think needs to go over to the receiving warehouse.   Great, you have some wiggle room.  Pack more necessary daily supplies, get them in place, etc.

But twenty managers then chime in, each saying they need something sent to the receiving warehouse.  Some of them are easier and smaller to port over, but you can't say for certain whether they'll help or not.   Other requests might be more challenging, but ultimately necessary for operations.   And then you have those big requests, which not only mean that you need to handle that item, but the supplies to make that work - and on top of that, it means you've just added to the list of things you needed to keep supplied.  So those 3 trucks you had to spare? You now have 2.

It's the part about the big requests I wanted to  emphasize.  Every time we talk about a large system, you have to count ALL of the items, materials and equipment you're going to need to keep the system up and running on a day-to-day basis.  And that's not something you can go ""Here, have a mess of parts, and a mess of supplies, you should be good for a month of running this thing.""   It has to be sustained.   And this is on top of the many other systems that are new to the Ukrainians - they're all competing for that limited supply channel.   Any logistical management team for NATO and Ukraine is playing this knife-edge balance HOURLY.   To them, the answer to the question you posed is going to be ""I don't know.   Sure, you might have some fighters and tanks, but was it worth sacrificing shipping small-arms ammunition and body armor to the troops on the ground that we know they needed, or the shells and rockets for the M777s and HIMARS that are just as important?""",1663690347.0,1663689709.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip7871y,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, also known as the 1993 October Coup, Black October, the Shooting of the White House or Ukaz 1400, was a political stand-off and a constitutional crisis between the Russian president Boris Yeltsin and the Russian parliament that was resolved by Yeltsin using military force. The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The power struggle reached its crisis on 21 September 1993, when President Yeltsin intended to dissolve the country's highest body (Congress of People's Deputies) and parliament (Supreme Soviet), although the constitution did not give the president the power to do so.

F-16s would take losses in the Ukraine war, in the hands of either side. And that's in spite of all the extra tech they have on board since they were first rolled out in the 70s.

Ironically the pre lend-lease Soviet truck was actually a license built US truck, the Ford Model AA built as the GAZ-AA (and later the MM and AAA). The only downfall was that the AA was built as a commercial on-road truck for the US where whilst dirt tracks still existed, highways were in full swing and so the design reflected mixed road use, with relatively stiff suspension, skinny tyres on a single rear axle, and consequential high axle weight, and a rear wheel drive 2x4 power train with only 4 speeds and relatively long gearing for the era to maximize top speed on long straights. It also featured a low, wide front bumper that extended in front of both wheels. On much poorer rural Soviet roads, it was inadequate as a military truck in every regard.

The lend lease GMC and Studebaker trucks arrived with soft, high travel suspension, selectable 6x6 all wheel drivetrains including hi/low range transfer case, extra low first gear in either range, double rear axles on thick knobbly tyres and much lower axle weight, and a vastly improved front that did away with a low level bumper and allowed much rougher terrain to be traversed with ease.

 >Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov (Russian: Станисла́в Евгра́фович Петро́в; 7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who played a key role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident. On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm.

A couple of big things kicked them though.

Firstly, they really didn't nail transistors. Partly this was due to not being driven by the same needs as the USA, and partly this was due to their scientific skillset lying outside of electronics. The US development of transistors was massively accelerated by the need for smaller and lighter guidance systems on missiles and spacecraft, especially as the Apollo moon missions loomed. Try as they might, the Americans were struggling to increase the payload capacity of their rockets and every kilogram of computer ate into carrying ability. The Soviets however, actually led the way on multistage heavy lift rockets, and so the need for payload weight reduction was far less. Their big rockets had no such cap on payload, and so much larger (but actually more reliable in space) vacuum tube systems were perfectly acceptable for their needs. Computers outside of the military were little more than a curiosity at this stage. Being an aerospace engineer was far more glamorous than an electronic engineer, so the imbalance continued with electronic engineers generally getting a lower calibre of intake.

Secondly, those rockets, and their end purposes, became a huge money sink for the USSR. The space race and the nuclear arms race would be huge expenses that they absolutely could not skimp on for fear of losing the edge in the Cold War, and the Soviets truly believed that the moment they failed to maintain MAD, the US would wipe them off the Earth. All of those spaceflight and missile firsts in the 60s that had the US so worried came at immense and long term financial cost - the arms race would effectively bankrupt the USSR by the late 70s, and would also consume almost all of their technological development budget. Subsequent consumer products were for the most part made using proven older designs (which actually gave them a good role as no-frills products on the export market) or through reverse engineering Western designs. The most long-lived Soviet brands often combined both - the FED camera that was still highly popular as a first ""good"" camera for amateurs the world over was a near perfect copy of the pre-WW2 Leica cameras using tooling they obtained during the invasion of Germany.",False,1663713057.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip95qqx,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Sometimes they just skip numbers too because several ideas might get scrapped in a row without any serious work being done on them.

On the whole, this is the order of America's air superiority and fighter-bomber fleet since the 1970s:

- F-14 Tom Cat: America's primary aircraft carrier frame. Designed to be light and nimble and take off and touch down on carriers. It's the plane featured in the original Top Gun. It's been retired for a while. It's so out of date at this point that many American friendly countries, as well as neutral and even ""enemy"" countries like Iran, have it in their possession.

- F-16 Falcon: Designed to be the predominant air-bomber for the US and NATO-aligned countries. It can do most air-to-air and air-to-ground tasks. Functions well in clearing the skies and bombing small to medium-sized targets on the ground. The plane is less complicated than more advanced aircraft and was designed to out-produce the competition. It has an efficient flow of repair and replacement parts, making logistics easy. Many, many frames are still maintained to this day in America's arsenal, and the F-16 has been proliferated down to dozens of friendly countries, including 

- F-15: America's primary air superiority specialty fighter, completed after the F-16. Not nearly have been produced. It has a massive dual engine and is designed to go toe-to-toe with the Soviet Union's Mig-25 Foxbat, which scared the shit out of NATO when they first learned about it. Until the 2000s, the F-15 was arguably the best fighter aircraft in the world, with the best targeting technology.

- F-18 Super Hornet: America's replacement for the F-14 Tom Cat. It's a heavier airframe, seats two people, and has a large bomb load. The F-18 allows America to bomb entire countries from the takeoff position of a single aircraft carrier sitting outside enemy range in blue ocean waters. It's still the predominant aircraft used on American carriers today; however, it needs replacement because it is incapable of stealth.

- F-117 Night Hawk: America's original stealth light bomber. It's not as massive as the enormous B-2. It also had mixed results when deployed in the Gulf War and Kosovo theaters. It has now been retired from America's operational fleets because its stealth technology left more to be desired than its appearance would suggest.

- F-22 Raptor: America's (and the world's) most advanced stealth air superiority fighter ever produced. It is the first and is still the very best Generation 5 aircraft. Today, an F-22 could likely single-handedly knock out half a dozen F-35s on its own from ranges the F-35s wouldn't even be able to detect it. It is designed to be better hidden than all enemy aircraft while also possessing better detection capabilities than all other enemy aircraft, and based on published results this design has succeeded in its goals. Its only limitation in the air is its limited ammunition because it needs to keep its load light to make best use of its stealth design. It was designed during the 1990s, when it was first thought that the USSR would still be a threat, but of course the USSR rapidly crumbled away, so much of the F-22 program was curbed back. Manufacturing chains for replacement parts and frames were never kicked into high gear, and as time went on the US decided to just skip to the next generation of air superiority fighter instead of bothering to update this frame. There are still a few dozen F-22s in use to this day, and they are still the unquestioned best frame in the skies anywhere on Earth, but the US has stopped producing replacement parts for these birds and is incrementally retiring them as they wear down.

- F-35: The F-35 was designed in the late 90s/early 2000s, as a replacement for... no, not the F-22, but actually a replacement for the F-16 and F-18. It is intended to be not only America's but the entire Western world's backbone in the air. It is not the same as the F-22. It's not as expensive or as impressive, and that is intentional. It's supposed to be a ""multi-role"" fighter-bomber like the F-16 and F-18. It can clear the skies like an F-22 (but not as well) and it can bomb the shit out of the enemy's advanced warning, radar, and AA systems like an F-16 or F-18 (but not as well). It is stealthed like the F-22 (but not as well), and it is very low on bomb/missile load to maintain its proper stealth profile. When used in ideal circumstances, the F-35 has no missiles outside of an internal bomb bay, and several F-35 designs don't even bother having a machine gun in the nose so that it can save on weight.

- The real benefit of the F-35 most people don't know about: Not only is the F-35 stealthed, which is awesome, but it's actually better than the F-22 in two big ways. First, it possesses the technology for an integrated *network* of weapons, reconnaissance and targeting. This means that the F-35 can get close to an enemy target with its stealth mode, target that enemy, and a *non-stealthed bomber way behind it* can unleash the weapon intended to bomb that target. The F-35 can operate in a network swarm of multiple air frames, guiding in missiles and bombs, without the enemy ever seeing a single American aircraft. This is an unprecedented force multiplier technology that will become commonplace in the next 10-20 years in all advanced militaries. The second benefit is the F-35s cost and prevalence. You probably remember a lot of talk in the last 15 years about the exploding costs of the F-35. The reality is, as more and more of them have been built and rolled out, their production and maintenance costs have reduced dramatically. It is now cheaper for the F-35 to be produced than it is for many non-stealthed generation 4 and 4.5, newer designed European peer aircraft like the Grippin and Eurofighter. It's even going to be cheaper to produce and maintain than the F-16. Already, more F-35s are produced every year than virtually all other peer-level aircraft by all other nations combined. China has made a few dozen stealth craft this past year; Lockheed Martin produced *more than 500 F-35s in that same time period*. There are going to be more than 2,000 F-35s produced and deployed to both the US and its friends in the next few years, and they will be pumping out and maintaining these aircraft until the 2050s at least.

- The final aircraft coming down the pipeline in the next 10 years or so is the ""Sixth Generation Fighter."" It is an ultra-stealthed aircraft still in pre-prototype stages. It will allegedly be operable as both a piloted craft and as a drone. Provided the US can economically afford it in its intended role, this project is on target to easily outpace anything China or Russia have coming down their own pipelines in the same time period.",1663688747.0,1663688007.0,t3_xiygvd,t1_ip7awoo,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
