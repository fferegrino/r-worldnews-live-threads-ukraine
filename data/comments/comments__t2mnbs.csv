Article 3c of the same bans reinsurance of any aircraft used by a Russian person or to be used in Russia. The vast majority of the civil aviation fleet in the world is leased and lessors have to comply with EU sanctions. It is a condition of most aircraft lease contracts that adequate reinsurance is maintained. 

Unless the reinsurers on the London reinsurance market wishes to violate EU sanctions which is incredibly unlikely (and the UK will probably pass their own identical sanctions anyway even if they did not directly apply to the reinsurers involved) no Russian airline will be able to obtain reinsurance from a reinsurer compliant with EU sanctions for any flight anywhere. Doesn’t matter if an aircraft is registered in Russia or Bermuda or anywhere else. Doesn’t matter if it’s a foreign airline flying over Russia. Doesn’t matter if it goes from Moscow to St Petersburg. It’s not happening. Although execution of the prohibition is suspended until 28 March 2022 for contracts concluded before 26 February 2022 aircraft leasing companies will likely seek to repossess their planes from Russia en masse now that the reinsurance will be imminently cancelled.

If anyone reading this is in Russia and wishes to leave then get out. Now. Don’t book a flight (expect lots of cancellations as airlines get their fleets repossessed). Take the train. Don’t look back.

""On 26 September 1983, the nuclear early-warning radar of the Soviet Union reported the launch of one intercontinental ballistic missile with four more missiles behind it, from bases in the United States. These missile attack warnings were suspected to be false alarms by Stanislav Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces on duty at the command center of the early-warning system.

I always thought NATO could easily trash the Russian army if it wanted to. But I did not expect the gap to be this big. Perhaps slightly worse due to a number of factors.

Some observations based on combat footage and post-battle reports being thrown around in the media.

A) Russian logistics are already screwed after just a few days. This is so weird to me, surely when you spend months to plan an invasion you would be prepared in such a way that you could at least keep logistics tight for a week or more, minimally. Especially when your aim is to topple Kiev within a few days. 

B) Many inexperienced soldiers. I have seen videos of Russians showing no knowledge of tactics. Walking in a street with 3 armoured vehicles, and all the soldiers besides them bunched up. Easy target for an ambush. This narrative seems to be dominant thus far. Many many inexperienced troops. And the few experienced troops seem to have been wasted resources. The paratroopers being used early on  for example.

C) The above is probably aggravated due to many unmotivated soldiers. If the narrative is true that many conscripts have been forced into a war. 

D) Underestimated Ukraine's defenses and sheer willpower. 

E) Likely a less than optimal strategy being used thus far. No clear doctrine can be found. I heard from the reddit live meeting one of the ex-US Air Force veterans pretty much summed it up that way; total surprise about this strange strategy being used.",False,1645964878.0,t3_t2mnbs,t3_t2mnbs,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

It is worth pointing out a few issues with trying to draw these parallels.

Firstly Ukraine has already given up it’s nukes, which were left over from the fall over the Soviet Union. It has already signed a global treaty with regards to basing nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which includes NATO nukes. Further proliferation of NATO nukes in European countries, close to Russia, is a history. 

Moreover, there is key difference between Ukraine and Cuba. Castro was set on using them. It’s the primary reason why Khrushchev had them removed. He was actually scared Castro was going to use them on Guantanamo, and then the US, regardless of the affect of his own people and Russian troops in Cuba. 

Khrushchev said the following in his secret memoirs about Castro. 

> ""This is insane. Not only is he preparing to die himself, he wants to drag us with him. Only lunatics or suicides, who themselves want to perish and to destroy the whole world before they die, could do this.""

Goes on to point out that Russia can't gain control of 44+ million people. He said Putin is doing this because Ukraine's democracy is a threat to Russia; believes once Russians see how successful Ukraine is with elected leaders, they'll want democracy too and that'll what Putin is afraid of. He asked people around the world not to use Russian media so that Russia can't profit from it and can't spread propaganda. No-fly zone: they want a humanitarian no-fly zone and he wants Russians to feel the same economic pains as Ukraine is feeling now, so more sanctions. Ended by saying: ""Freedom will prevail.""

He was inside a building that had lights on, seemed calm, and looked very good (considering what's going on). I've no idea how he got through the interview, but I'm so glad members of the government are doing interviews, really puts a very personal connection on this for those of us far away. As ever, incredibly impressed by the Ukrainians.

“The world order, as it appeared as the result of WW2 after 1945, seems to not represent the real political and economical balance of powers and the challenges which we face. A new world order has still not been found. Finding it can impossibly be up to Germany or it’s parliament alone. However, we will have to do our part. A world in which there are wars, in which nations threaten each other with weapons of mass destruction, in which millions of people live hunger and misery, in which human rights are violated on a daily basis, and in which the natural basis of life of future generations is destroyed, is no just world.“ 

And he was fucking right. That was 24 years ago, and yet we are still here. It‘s fucking depressing. 

Edit: “Alterspräsident” is literally “President of the house due to old age”. In the UK that role is called father/mother of the house. Until the “Parlamentspräsident” (speaker of the house) is elected by the parliament, the oldest member of parliament used to temporarily fill that role.

The Western alliance promised to ""hold Russia"" and Belarus ""accountable"" for the ""brutal and wholly unprovoked and unjustified"" ""invasion"" of Ukraine on Friday, warning that Moscow would be made to pay ""a severe price"" for its actions.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the military to put the nation's nuclear deterrence forces on high alert Sunday following ""aggressive statements"" from NATO.

""Top officials of leading NATO nations indulge in making aggressive statements about our country. Therefore, I am ordering the minister of defence and the chief of the general staff to put the deterrence forces of the Russian army into special combat duty mode,"" Putin said in a briefing with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov.

The video shows a mess of   Russian soldiers clustered around armored vehicles like it's still World War 2. They scatter aimlessly as soon as firing starts. Now there are videos of Ukrainians looting the abandoned vehicles.  I'm not a soldier and I know that the first way to die in a war zone is to group up. This is insanity. The plans for a quick war didn't work out. Putin needs to come to the table.

Russia can occupy Ukraine, but he is insane if he thinks the cost will be small.

Scholz admitted that the urgency of the Ukraine crisis had forced the decision to invest in the German military telling the emergency session of the Bundestag “it is clear that we must invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and democracy.”  
He called it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Russian president Vladimir Putin “does not turn the clocks back”.  
Long-term, defence spending is to be increased year on year by more than 2% of GDP he said. It is currently around 1.5% with Germany having been under growing pressure from its NATO allies, in particular the US, to increase the amount for years. The existence of the special fund should be anchored in Germany’s constitution Scholz said in order to ensure it remained a guarantee beyond the life of the current parliament.  
Germany has long been criticised by its allies for its resistance to increasing its defence spending. This position has been reinforced by a strong pacifist sentiment amongst the electorate linked to Germany’s bloody Nazi past. In recent weeks the country was also under fire for having not offered enough material support in particular refusing to deliver lethal weapons to assist Ukraine to defend itself against Russia.  
But a turning point came on Saturday evening when the government made the surprise announcement that it would be sending weapons and other supplies to Ukraine, including 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 surface to air Stinger missiles and thousands of gallons of petrol.  
The decision marks a historical break with Germany’s post-war pledge to not export weapons to conflict zones.

No worries, it's confusing times alright! This guy seems more of the 'bought and paid for' ilk of right wing/far right American politicians whose sole purpose is to seek disruption. 

1. [Claiming that only two areas would be invaded](https://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1496473769707192330) which has obviously not been the case. Also lying as [Luhansk] (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk) people is 49% Ukranian vs 47% Russian, while [Donetsk](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk) is 56% Ukranian vs. 38% Russian, though Russian is the dominant language in each. 

2. [Talking about how Ukraine was ""torn apart from the USSR""](https://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1497075166035202068) when the Ukranian people [voted for their own independence in 1991 with over 92% of the vote.]
(http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Ukrainian_independence_referendum)

3. [Again downplaying that an invasion is happening and trying to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty.]
(http://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1495907439245410304)

4. [A week before the invasion, implying that it was nonsense and wouldn't be happening.] (https://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1493987128388292617)

5. [Outright support of the invasion](https://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1496091167074754563) because of... the Cuban missile crisis 60 years ago. 

6. [Trying to blame the US President for any potential issues arising in Chernobyl,] (https://mobile.twitter.com/BryanDMcNally/status/1496869918645669888), which he had claimed in those earlier tweets was not going to be invaded, for not taking stronger action, despite his claims that no action was needed at all.

So to summarise their claims: the Russian majority of Luhansk and Donetsk (who are not a majority) want this and only those areas will be invaded (even though all of Ukraine has been invaded), as Ukraine was 'torn apart' from USSR (when it voted 92% for independence), and that other areas not being invaded but also being invaded like Chernobyl will be the fault of foreign politicians for not taking stronger action when they should have taken no action at all.

Now to be clear, some of what they are claiming to be fake very likely is - information and disinformation are key parts of any war - but this person is on no way even attempting to be hienst on the whole and is happy to spread lies and change them to new lies as and when needed.",1645964553.0,1645964315.0,t3_t2mnbs,t3_t2mnbs,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Security correspondent, BBC News

President Putin has ordered his military command to put nuclear forces on a ""special' state of alert.

This is after what Moscow calls ""aggressive statements"" by Nato countries.

Russia's leader had already issued a coded warning that he was willing to use nuclear weapons as he began his invasion of Ukraine.

Last week, he warned that ""whoever tries to hinder us"" would see consequences ""you have never seen in your history"".

These words were widely interpreted as signalling a threat to use nuclear weapons if the West stood in his way.

The very public shift to high alert status is a way for Moscow to send a warning. Moving to alert status is likely to make it easier to launch weapons more quickly. But it does not mean there is a current intent to use them.

Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world but also knows that Nato also has enough to destroy Russia if they were used.

But the aim is likely to try and deter Nato support for Ukraine by creating fears over how far he is willing to go and creating ambiguity over what kind of support for Ukraine he will consider to be too much.",False,1645970296.0,t3_t2mnbs,t3_t2mnbs,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

We’ve even seen a picture of this soiree, thanks to trigger-happy Instagrammer Liz Truss, who came along for the fun, along with several other senior Tory women.

I have some important stuff to say. 

I know the situation is dire. I am so fucking sorry that my Ukrainian brothers and sisters are going through this hell. I am half Ukrainian myself. A year ago, I genuinely thought about moving to Ukraine if Russia becomes too dangerous to live (being gay, trans, and politically active kinda makes you scared to be Russian).

There are lots of talks about pressing Putin from outside Russia while Russian peoples must press him from inside the country. To do that, Western representatives are imposing sanctions to force common people into action (SWIFT, import limitations, PayPal etc.)

You are right. We must clean up the mess we made. Although I was only 18 when Crimea was annexed, and even younger when Putin became the autocrat he is; realistically, he is the mess our parents made. Putin fed into their post-90's, post-Afghan anxiety so much that they kept rooting for him for the sake of feeling safe for the first time in their adult lives.

We as Russians have to do our part in getting rid of this fucking embarrassment of a president.

But frankly, we as protesters feel extremely isolated and alone. Our parents are fed with propaganda, they are stubborn as fucking hell. They never protested and never will because the Russian government abused, gaslit, and scared them shitless.

So most our protesters are pro-West freelancers 30 y.o. and younger, artists, feminists, queer people who depend on working with European and American customers. For many of us, this is the only source of income that allows us to eat at least 2 times a day, pay our rent, and stay authentic and fair in our work (instead of, you know, getting on a Kremlebot payroll and spamming your socials with dangerous MAGA bullshit).

PAYPAL IS OUR PROTESTERS' ONLY MEANS OF LIVING. The government doesn't even use it. BY REMOVING PAYPAL FROM RUSSIA, YOU ARE SUFFOCATING RUSSIAN PROTESTS. 

Tl;dr STOP PAYPAL FROM LEAVING RUSSIA. This is the only source of income left for the Russian protesters. This is how we support our lives AND our fight. PayPal's leaving will sink our ship instead of keeping it afloat. DO NOT ISOLATE US FROM PAYPAL, ELSE WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO EAT.

Edit 1: clarity

Edit 2: I'm sorry, I really didn't make it clear.

I would never wanted to victimize myself when Ukrainians have fucking war on their doorstep. My point is, Paypal's leaving Russia means that WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PROTEST. 

We need money to pay our fines when we are detained. We need money to donate to our human rights organizations that stop the police from abusing and torturing protesters. We need to spread our anti-war leaflets. And for sure we need to eat.

We all so desperately want to fucking do something and stop this madness.

SWIFT blocking has much less of an effect as the central bank assets freezing. I underestimated that swift is just very annoying as you have to find other ways to deal with transactions. The security freezing is what blocks the banks ability to control the Rubel. Normally you buy or sell Rubel or the other currency to stabilize it. Now you can't sell dollars or euros because they are frozen.

No idea why they made the mistake of keeping those funds accessible in Europe. Swiss or back home would have been a better option due to inaccessibility.

Now they need to be clever, there are certain ways to bypass it, but it's hard. You need to trust that the money would be recoverable eventually in the future to make deals with frozen assets as guarantee. It's possible (similar to I.O.U.), but you need to be fast and a step ahead of freezing, not behind.

I know Reddit has been pretty focal about its criticism of Germany, calling it an embarrassment, but I wonder if this is just Reddit being Reddit or if this sentiment is shared by the general population of Germany?

Edit: Lots of people trying to be smart and claim the invasion is the reason, which is clearly not the case.

Not that I think you should agree with it, but I think you should be allowed to express your opinion. Unfortunately objectivity isn't a thing that we're that great at, and it's not exactly uncommon after conflicts to look back and go ""oh shit, my government really wasn't the good guy there huh?""(again, I 100% support Ukraine, not saying that's the case in this war) Fortunately we are free (normally) to protest wars, and express our opinions to our government (kinda the point of a democratic government you know?) 

Forcing people to pretend they agree with you is never going to do anything but drive the dissenters underground and into echo chambery groups. Discussion is the way to change people's mind, and free speech is needed for that.

Edit: no need to get spicy, I have my opinion, you have yours. 

I simply believe that you should never be prosecuted by a government for expressing your opinion. No matter how wrong it is in my point of view, I think that ""we'll remove your right to argue against us so that they don't remove your right to argue against them"" isn't the way to go about things.

Edit 2: Okay so turns out this is actually quite a reasonable, pre existing restriction on speech.

Part of me wonders if he will use it as an excuse to go to war with the world. He knows he can’t win, but he seems like exactly the kind of megalomaniac that would trigger all these events because he feels the end coming for him, and go out in a blaze of nuclear fire just to fuck over the world and his own people who no longer accept him.

They can't afford to lose their momentum (such as it is and what there is of it) but their forward operating bases across the border barely have the resources to supply the troops just sitting there.

So since they can't just sit and wait a week or two to build up enough fuel and other supplies to make a sizable push, they are just throwing themselves forward piecemeal and hoping to get lucky.

How to use it: This is a favourite swear word in Russian. It was previously used freely, but in the 19th century made it to the list of restricted words. The root of the word means ‘wander around’, referring to a woman who sleeps around. The original meaning refers to a woman of an ancient profession but actually isn’t used in that sense.

In the same fashion, Putin likely launched this war to bolster his domestic support with a quick and easy win, not unlike when he seized the Crimea in 2014.  Now that his forces are getting bogged down and taking severe casualties, he's quickly reaching the point where even 'victory' wouldn't help him achieve his real objectives and the mounting casualties may even do more harm to domestic support problem.

Germany has been very hard stance anti military / anti military spending for a long time because they get slammed continually by distrust and reminders of Ww2. Anytime they would increase spend or send support to other countries, they got alot of hate for individual germans just living their lives. You see it on games, and forums all the time anytime Germany is mentioned. Hell it's been posted so many times here this last week.

Getting a country where the people are so against war and military spending to change their laws and government policies takes time. They never were against providing aid, and never were against supporting, they just had to change more stuff in the background to allow it to happen. They also weren't against swift being withdrawn - they specifically always said it should be the next escalation.

Well, if it helps, such a strategy would be literally one of the dumbest strategies in the history of warfare. Think like this:  
  
1) Why would they purposefully give up the element of surprise, allowing the defenders time to fortify and rally their troops (and giving the Ukrainian reserves and civilians fighting experience by letting them train against a weaker enemy)?  
  
2) Why would they *on purpose* humiliate themselves on the world stage by seeming incompetent, untrained and underequipped if they weren't?  
  
3) Why would they drag things out so the west can put sanctions on them and give time for said sanctions to start working, ruining their economy even *before* the supposed ""real"" attack?  
  
4) Why would they do something that absolutely ruins the morale of their own troops and people while rallying the Ukrainians and boosting their morale?  
  
Real wartime strategy is not structured like some survival horde mode in a video game, where increasingly stronger waves of enemies are thrown at the player as they level up.  
  
Russia expected this to be a quick war. Blitzkrieg. Seize Kyiv and other major cities, neutralize military bases and air bases, install a puppet government, keep the infrastructure intact so the country remains productive.

I have talked with several of Indians on reddit, they are 100% behind Russia. They despise the west. You will hear a lot about 1971, and that is why they must support a dictator in Moscow. Don't believe the non-aligned BS they spew.

Some snippets that convey the overwhelming attitude I've seen from Indians on reddit:

>Why should we say anything about Ukraine,? Like at all? They are of no importance to us.

>And yes, it really is pro Russia. We just can't say that part out loud. We need Russia more than they need us and we need to do everything possible to preserve that alliance

...

>sure. fund terrorist nations to attack india, then send an armada to strong arm us, kill our nuclear, space scientists and hamper us even during 1999 kargil war.

>Of course we are gonna choose russia who helped us during ALL of the above US/NATO did to us. Fuck you too.

...

>Agree but india got sanctioned by most of the modern world after their nuclear tests. The us blocked countries from providing tech like the cryogenic engine so what should have taken a few years took India decades to develop. Mismanagement is also to blame but that’s not the point here. India needs arms to defend against hostile neighbors like China and Pakistan so until it can product its own, it will rely on its tested ally Russia.

...

>Ukraine voted against India when India got its nuclear weapons and also against India regarding Kashmir in the past

>Plus India has no significant economic, cultural, or defence ties to Ukraine so why should it care in its view?

>When has the west ever supported India regarding Kashmir, Chinese incursions, etc?

...

>Fyi just google Ukraine tank deal with Pakistan and then say why India should suddenly turn a blind eye to everything. Also, I don't remember Ukraine exactly shedding tears for us when our soldiers were being martyred last year in Galwan or any of the other wars.

...

>West including Ukraine tried to sanction India for developing it's own nuclear weapons just 2 decades ago. Thanks to Russia, west's effort converting India into next North Korea didn't succeeded.

>West have always stood against India during India's crucial moments.

...


>Lol. Weren't US citizens killing Indian Sikhs after 9/11? You fucks are so ignorant that any guy with brown skin looks like a terrorist to you. So, please fuck off.

>Indians prefer communism anyway. All of our major religions support communism. We don't need ""kill your grandmother for stock prices"" capitalism here. Also, we are more democratic than US. So, sincerely, fuck off with your judgement.

>I might hate Russia for stupid things too, but I will still prefer them over US or UK.",False,1645965892.0,t3_t2mnbs,t1_hymyljp,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

If it's the first then there is a chance - however slim - that Ukraine will eventually fall, that Russia will be able to withstand the sanctions, and that this will all turn into Cold War 2 between West and East. Furthermore this has a chance of India siding with Russia over NATO/EU, and even a chance of China growing stronger as a Third Power/Peacekeeper between the two sides.

If it's the second then we will see much more death in Ukraine but in my opinion likely with the country still standing by the end of this, with or without Luhansk/Donetsk. I do not believe Putin will have much of anything if this offensive isn't over in Russia's favour, if he will still even be alive by the end of it. Depending on the situation inside Russia proper there we can see anything from a coup to a civil war, no matter what happens to Putin. This in turn will likely lead to more horrors for the people of Russia.

NATO permanently creates forward bases adjacent to borders. Unpleasant side effect of increasing chance of accidental f*ck-up leading to further conflict / all out war. 

2 Russia turns Ukraine into Europe's Syria. Long term conflict, destabilisation, and prevent functioning democracy. Putin could see this as a win. Bordering countries affected by serious economic downturn, and huge long term humanitarian crisis. 

3 either mafia-oligarchs decide the shit show is bad for business, and-or military decide that turning eastern Europe into a wasteland through chemical/biological/tactical nuclear is a step too far; and there is a coup against Putin. Takes a while for the dust to settle, and then the Mafia and oligarchs go back to doing what they do best, and the Russian people (yet again) are shafted. 

Putin's original plan (install puppet govt) IMHO has almost zero chance of happening. The CivPop is now armed and motivated with little to lose. Escalating violence will only harden resolve, and drive us to #2.

Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi was referring to a decision by the European Commission and Group of Seven nations to remove certain Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system.
“Ukraine has made an official request for Japan to take a similar action,” Hayashi said Feb. 27 during a news program aired by public broadcaster Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). “Japan will make a response while closely monitoring the effects on financial markets.”

On the gas... Infrastructure. Yet the infrastructure was a pro-Bono job (for most countries) in which they give exclusivity for a bunch of years to the Gas companies in order to get the return on investment. As the countries didn’t want to improve/build that’s infrastructure and let private companies do it. 

That’s pretty common even with teleco companies. Movistar (Telefónica) build all the “optic fiber infrastructure” and they had a monopoly for years until they got the return on investment and x% of benefits. Nowadays they are still the national supplier and run all the cables and other companies just sell a service on the back of them, basically they rent the infrastructure. 

So this also happens with certain countries (mostly small ones). So they can be like, “I don’t want you to use our infrastructure”.

Also, the prices you’re used to certain price they can rise to a point that people must just check out for other alternative energy sources. 

Oil, is more about the prices. Oil already grow and it’s really expensive already so blocking Russian firms will bring more power to the other competitors.

So this is all a numbers game. Now most countries suffer from inflation and that could really mess the personal budgets of each.

We’ve been told our entire life that we’ve fucked up history pretty bad and that under no circumstances we as a nation can allow for something like this to ever happen again.

I was among the first generation not to be drafted into the military or community service at all. Armed forces around here have been on a steady decline and have mostly shifted priorities to defense and domestic aid, which made sense for us, because among us regulars, war always seemed so distant.

Right now there is a reason to ramp up the military again. I think we were kind of naive to wait until something actually happened, but I think we were hesitant because of our past and this is why it took us so long. Just not wanting to fuck it up again.

Wars are won not in the battlefield but politically.

The only way Russia could win this was if Ukraine leadership fled and the surrender took place in 1-2 days. Common Russian citizen feels no impact. The world has no news cycle of war, and other countries have no time to help mobilize aid.

The way Ukraine will win this is by holding out resistance till the economic pressures get to the wealthy in Russia and the common people. Also, the more they hold out, the more non-aligned countries lie Germany start to add aid. Once citizens of Russia feel the pain, they will start to turn on the leadership.

It doesn't make sense for the Ukranians to defend in open spaces. The Russian forces have the advantage in armor and planes, which are much less effective in city environments, so that's where the Ukranians are taking the fight. So looking at pure land gains isn't necessarily the right metric to look at.

So far the Russian forces have not been able to take any major population center, nor have they achieved full air supremacy. Both of those things were expected by outside observers and very likely the Russians themselves. So from that perspective, the Ukranians are doing well.

It's unfathomable to me that the Russians haven't claimed the air space, *and* that they are pressing ahead under those conditions. This violates a key tenet of modern warfare since WWII.

Their vanguard airborne units are getting taken out before they are dropped or destroyed on the ground. That means the Russian columns have to press into unfriendly territory with no established beachhead in front of them. It also means that their helicopters and other rapid-response units don't have a forward location to deploy from. That really cuts down on the ability to quickly respond to changing conditions.

This will not happen.""** Russia had already imposed import restrictions on certain Ukrainian products and Glazyev did not rule out further sanctions if the agreement was signed. Glazyev allowed for the possibility of separatist movements springing up in the Russian-speaking east and south of Ukraine. He insisted that, if Ukraine signed the agreement, it would violate the bilateral treaty on strategic partnership and friendship with Russia that delineates the countries borders. Russia would no longer guarantee Ukraine's status as a state and could possibly intervene if pro-Russian regions of the country appealed directly to Russia.[175]

> We were sitting next to McNamara in January 1992 when he learned from Russian General Anatoly Gribkov about the possibility of a nuclear attack on an invading US force in Cuba, a force that would not initially have been equipped with nuclear weapons. Normally loquacious, McNamara was rendered temporarily speechless. His face turned pale. He couldn’t believe what he had just heard. He asked the interpreters to confirm the accuracy of the translation. They did so. He became aware that the greatest danger of Armageddon in the crisis lay in what he and his president had not known, and in fact had never even imagined. His discovery might be summarized this way: In the event of any non-nuclear US air attack and invasion of Cuba, the nuclear war he wanted desperately to avoid would have begun on the beaches of Cuba at the initiation of the Soviets and Cubans. On October 26, 1962, McNamara imagined that such a US attack might be required within 24 hours, never dreaming that such an action would have been the penultimate move toward a catastrophic nuclear war that would begin in Cuba.

What did Castro learn? During the event, he believed for good reason that Cuba’s fate was sealed: The US attack was virtually inevitable, probably imminent, and likely nuclear. Here is what he told McNamara at the 1992 Havana conference:

Now, we started from the assumption that if there was an invasion of Cuba, nuclear war would erupt. We were certain of that. If the invasion had taken place in the situation that had been created, nuclear war would have been the result. Everybody here was simply resigned to the fate that we would be forced to pay the price, that we would disappear.

With this in mind, Castro wrote a now-famous letter on October 26, 1962, requesting that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev order a nuclear attack on the United States if, as expected, the Americans first attacked and invaded Cuba. (Castro declassified and released that letter in November 1990, during the run-up to a preparatory US-Cuban-Russian conference we organized in Antigua in January 1991.) The Cuban leader was worried about what he believed was a regrettable Russian tendency to delay (as Stalin had done in the hours immediately following the Nazi invasion). It may be asked: How could any factual revelations about the Cuban missile crisis have “haunted” a leader who seems to have expected, and to have faced defiantly, the total obliteration of his country?

Tanks and to an extent other armored vehicles generally are cramped with things you don't want exposed to hot high velocity things going through: People, Ammo, and Fuel. There are strategies in building tanks to try mitigate it, like blow out panels to try to vent an ammo explosion outside. However, They are more of a secondary thing as they've already defeated your armor. So if something does hit and cause a fire/detonation you get results like that. 

Generally if something does penetrate^1, The best hope is that the crew gets out and maybe the tank can be salvaged later. Worst case, it immediately 'cooks off' the ammo and that leads to the pictures of tank turrets blown up into the air from the pressure and completely burned out tanks. A straight fire will also look similar, but there's a chance the crew gets out. 


^1 It's complicated as you've also got spalling which is where I'm an impact  where the projectile doesn't go though, but flakes off the back of the armor, which can be as bad.

Wouldn't he be put on trial for the numerous horrific war-crimes we've been seeing? Wouldn't the other countries take some military/legal action on him?  
Also, how would the unfortunate Russian public deal with the economic after-math & the burden of being lead by a war-criminal? The world has been slow to impose sanctions and penalties (or take military action), but there are some in motion anyway.. how and when will those be lifted? With or without Putin still being there?  
 Not doing anything that actively affects Putin directly seems to me to be putting a bad precedent for any other such maniacal leaders that might be contemplating something similar and hoping to get away with sanctions on the country that will fade away over time...  
 

Sorry for these random uninformed thoughts, I'm just so scared and concerned for my colleagues, friends and public both in Russia and Ukraine. More so for the ones in Ukraine understandably, but I'd hate to be in the position Russian civilians  that have nothing to do with the war are in.

After the invasion of Georgia in 2008 he realized that traditional warfare wouldn't work. So he began using softer tactics: deniable invasion of Crimea and the Donbas in 2014, destabilizing democracies in Europe and North America by funding far right groups and nationalist candidates, destabilizing NATO through the same (and Trump), destabilizing the EU by funding Brexit politicians, building up a cyber warfare arm, etc. He also began focusing on improving The Russian military so it could win a stand up fight.


My theory is that all of those things were likely supposed to culminate in a 2020 or 2021 attack on Ukraine, either Trump is still the American president and he prevents NATO from uniting. Or the United States is wracked with insurrection (Russian influence operatives are still active in the QAnon and fascist web spheres). Either way NATO and the EU don't respond firmly. And after a lightning conquest of Ukraine he can move onto Lithuania or Latvia or Estonia because NATO is too weak to stand up to him.


 *But* COVID-19 happened and his plans got delayed to 2022. Trump is out of office, Biden is firmly in control, Brexit is done so the EU has recovered and so has Britain. NATO unites and stands up to him. Ukraine is well funded and trained.

Is it, though?

A week ago, I think this was the conventional wisdom. But as it stands now, Russia still doesn't control a single major city and supplies are flowing in from the Southwest to Ukraine, which I don't think Russia is going to be able to stop anytime soon.

I'm a bit annoyed at the Reddit echo chamber, but that doesn't mean that Russian supply lines won't break down and that Russian troops won't defect en masse or that the Russian army *won't* completely run out of steam. Even if they gain control of three-quarters of the country, that may not be enough to secure a surrender and they'll be stretched quite thin, as Ukraine is rather large.
