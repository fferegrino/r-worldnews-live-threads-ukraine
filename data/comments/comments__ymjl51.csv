One 60-something villager says that in her experience, the occupiers came in waves—some waves had thieves and rapists, other waves had men who’d bring humanitarian aid to villages, admit they were fascists, that what they do to Ukraine was wrong, then also coldly recount how they themselves had murdered civilians already—making the contrition hollow.  

> According to her, the occupiers constantly climbed around the houses.  They looked for sugar and yeast for brewing, vodka, moonshine, stole all alcohol, even its empty bottles. 

> They also stole warm clothes, blankets, and appliances—heaters, washing machines, refrigerators. A computer was taken from one woman, which was later found at another house. The invaders carried everything they stole around the village, from house to house, using it.

> She did not hear about torture happening in her village [all elderly], but says that the occupiers shot a volunteer nearby.

> For 6 months, she would daydream about the Russians being pushed back, about Ukrainian soldiers entering the village, about what her first meeting with them would be like.

> When the Russians did flee, the village drew quiet—the dogs stopped barking. She walked down the road to a friend’s place, to invite her to tea and cake to celebrate their liberation. On the way, she suddenly met two dozen soldiers.

> *""Everything went cold inside me. I think ‘it's o&%!’  I stood still, I didn’t know what to do. . . And then I notice—they have yellow ribbons tied on their sleeves and helmets!  Tears streamed and started to choke me. I covered my mouth with my hand and ran to them. ‘Boys! say that you are our boys!’ They laugh. ‘We’re yours, we’re yours.’ I burst into tears, hugging them and saying: ‘We have waited for you for so long!’”* -recalls the resident of Kherson region, crying.  

> According to her, the boys were tired, the locals fed them, even gave them that cake.  She herself invited several of them to her place for the night, ""so that they could sleep in a human way,"" and in the morning she fed them breakfast. She says that during the six months of horror in which she lived during the occupation, the most terrifying thing was not the shells that flew overhead, but the presence of Russians in the village.

The man says that his battalion arrived on the front line in the early hours of 2 November.

“They sent us there and told us to dig trenches. We had only three shovels for the entire battalion, we had no equipment at all. We dug what we could, and by the morning, they’d started firing at us: from artillery, Grads [rocket launchers], mortars, drones, they shot to kill. When it started, the officers immediately ran away. Between the attacks, we tried to dig trenches, but we were detected by drones right away and shot at. **Out of 570 people, 29 survived, 12 are injured, the rest are gone,” Agafonov said.**

Day 255 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Both yesterday and today it was pretty quiet, we had no missile strikes and no drones. Though just an hour ago, at 9pm, there were some missile launches from Belgorod, which were most likely air defenses, but apparently some missiles were headed for Chuhuiv again. So what could have happened is that they launched more missiles in our direction and they just malfunctioned as usual, blowing up over Belgorod yet again.

We were supposed to have planned rolling blackouts here, but thankfully they never happened in my district, or rather they only happened once. And we are not even sure if that one time was actually planned, because just 20 minutes before that blackout happened we had the last massive Russian missile strike on our energy infrastructure all over Ukraine, which means that that blackout was probably not a scheduled one. 

Though as we found out just recently today, blackouts *do happen* in Kharkiv. We talked with our friends from Saltivka district and they said that they have been sitting without electricity since 11am today. So it’s not that blackouts don’t happen in Kharkiv, it’s just that they haven’t happened in our district so far. We are also apparently now having emergency blackouts instead of scheduled ones, so electricity is getting turned off depending on current situation in a particular city/district, instead of it being planned beforehand.

I will return from war and look them in the eye
All those who claim they have no desire to live
Who are fed up with their jobs and bored by television
I will give them a glimpse into what I have seen...

The extremes of unbearable cold by night
And overwhelming heat by day
While they were waiting too long for a taxi
And getting caught in the rain

We dared not fall asleep even for a moment, uncertain
When the Grad missiles would hit like thunder

We learned how to sleep despite the noise of the mortars
We took turns at being alert, so that others could ?doze off?

Instead of tents, my friend, we slept in cellars
Cold holes in the ground warmed by nothing
Except our dreams and longing for our homes

There were times when we drank water off the ground
And the only supper for ten men was one fried common snake
We were all healthy, or seemed to be
Since no one ever spoke about being sick

The worst experience to which one grew accustomed
Was the daily loss of another man

And the uncertainty that the next day it could be YOU
We learned to deal with it... we found the strength...we could cope

We are not the heroes you say we are...
This is a place where humans go insane, their souls unhealthy
From the experience of war... from a profound grief

While most others have shown their strength
Blood and pain have made them stronger

We are here so that YOU can live there in peace
We are here with the same desire for peace...
And even when I am lying in a slit trench
I never mistake it for a grave...

Instead my thoughts are about home, and work, and family
I look forward to removing this armor for the last time...
You can help by loving life
There where you have peace and good fortune

Don't wish ill upon yourself

https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3211167/sabrina-singh-deputy-pentagon-press-secretary-holds-a-press-briefing/

This briefing is focused on the **USAI** weapons contracts that was just announced. There are also some questions about the North Korean situation.

Since I still see people making this mistake, I'm going to clarify this again - PDA and USAI are not the same thing.

PDA (Presidential Drawdown Authority) is a program that allows the President to pull fully functional military equipment that is already in stock in warehouses around the world, and give it to Ukraine.

USAI (Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative) is a program that issues *contracts* for equipment to be purchased/built/refurbished so that it can be given to Ukraine. These will be *future* deliveries, not an immediate shipment. 

These are two different programs, with different budgets, and different purposes. There's a bit of further explanation in the transcript, including a program called Excess Defense Articles . . .

>which is a program that services can use to declare equipment in excess and make available for allies and partners.  So this often includes older equipment, equipment's in need of, you know, service and repairs or upgrades, and they just no longer meet the services' requirements

A few points of interest:

>To maintain the historic level of our ongoing security assistance support for Ukraine, I'm pleased to announce today that the department will establish the Security Assistance Group Ukraine, what we will SAGU, which is a dedicated headquarters element in Wiesbaden, Germany and under U.S. European Command to coordinate our efforts. 

>So none of these are U.S. tanks.  They're coming from the Czech Republic defense base.  So we are paying for 45 of these to be refurbished, and the government of the Netherlands is paying for an additional 45 to be refurbished, so they're matching our commitment.  So a total of 90 tanks will be delivered to Ukraine.

>some of the tanks will be available to Ukraine before the end of December, so the end of this year, with additional deliveries to be completed in 2023.

>In terms of why aren't we providing new tanks or American tanks, introducing a new main battle tank is extremely costly, it's time-sensitive, and it would be a huge undertaking for the Ukrainian forces.",False,1667665679.0,t3_ymjl51,t3_ymjl51,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

Not long after he claimed he was going to Ukraine personally to lead some sort of unit of unknown size. He posted evidence he was in Ukraine (it was geolocated to Rostov-On-Don immediately) 

Well since then he has been posting semi-regularily but all of it is to collect donations for his ""unit"" which he will never specify where they are fighting, what their size is or what they're doing. Just that they definitely TOTALLY exist and he isn't just in hiding and trying to grift for personal gain. Couldn't be possible

Anyways the only post out of the ordinary from his usual begging is a bizarre post from today about 12 hours ago, it reads (underneath an anti-abortion video)

*The cannibals in white coats sell Russian children for their organs! They should be shot on the spot!* 

*How many Russians die as a result of SVO (Special military operation), and instead of strengthening the home front, they also kill their offspring on the home front*

When Ukraine does major offenses they are generally successful. 

If Ukraine continues to get sufficient western support it will win in a long time at terrible cost. 

Russia has somehow managed to make Ukraine a partisan issue in the US, which fucking sucks.   

The war will start to depend as much on foreign election cycles as on facts on the ground in Ukraine. 

The reality is that if Putin wants to spend hundreds of billions and hundreds of thousands of lives on this, he can. Ukraine can’t liberate its territory or even stop Russian progress against that without significant foreign help. 

Iran and NK are helping Russia. At least in theory Russia will be able to start to get a better domestic arms industry even in the face of sanctions. Iran can help Russia a lot in making okay weapons despite sanctions. 

This will still go on a very long time.

1) The URSS (and later russia) were poor countries. So, optimizing and reduce expenses was essential. Railways are way cheaper than land/air based logistics. Imagine transporting a full batallion of tanks. A few trains can do it.

2) The URSS always assumed if war broke out it would be againsnt Nato, so the railways were developed in their western front. The rest of the country has poor logistics. That's why it takes so long to deploy stuff that was on the chinese border or deep in siberia.

3) Russia always assumed war would be close to their borders, so no heavy land or air logistics needed.

4) Low or inexistent maintenance. Soviet/Russian equipment breaks a lot. And a lot really means a lot. I remember reading some experts analysing russian truckssaying that most of the tires were pretty much dead. Cracks everywhere and manufacture dates from the 90's. This can't last for long.

5) There were some images/videos of trucks heavily loaded. I'm pretty sure because of logistic strain they loaded trucks well beyond their maximum wheight. Things will break down more.

More EMTs, social workers, mental health professionals that can deescalate situations, with police on standby if needed.

>The show was inspired by and loosely modeled on David Stirling's British Special Air Service (SAS), which used modified Jeeps armed with machine guns as their transport through the treacherous desert terrain, and Popski's Private Army. Such units did not exist as part of the American military until after the Second World War. The title of the program refers to the nicknames given to some of the British Commonwealth forces in the North African campaign (Rats of Tobruk, the primarily Australian defenders of the city of Tobruk or the British Desert Rats).

>At the time of the original telecast, many British, Australian, and New Zealand viewers took offense at the majority of American characters on the program, resulting in the show's being pulled from the BBC after six episodes. In Australia, the show was quickly relegated to a Saturday afternoon timeslot, when most people were out. The main audience became children who didn't know the history of WWII.

>I don’t want to hear about how we should be funding your unarmed dead men therapists when we should be funding more law enforcement to keep order.

Well you're gonna hear about it whether you like it or not.

""Eugene Police Chief Chris Skinner called theirs a 'symbiotic relationship' that better serves some residents of Eugene.

CAHOOTS addresses the shocking statistics showing a huge number of those shot by police have mental health issues. A bipolar or brain damaged person may go through episodes where they appear to be violent, and a police officer is not effectively trained to assess the threat level. 

Do you know that the model of a guy with the gun showing up to deal with nearly every problem isn't consistent around the world? When I was in Saudi Arabia, for example, the person responding to a traffic accident or motor vehicle violation was not a cop. It was basically a meter maid who just wrote a citation.

Which side of the border? If cartels are commonly cutting off the hands of Americans, that's news to me. I believe you are overstating the issue. El Paso looks across the river at Juarez, and yet it's one of the top couple safest big cities in the US. The drug war hasn't worked. We tried as hard as we could. Failed. It's over--this whole routine where we say ""If we only go at them a little harder."" More police, more tactical government agencies, hell, let's try the military. Bull. I've got buddies who were on the National Guard border mission. They didn't do shit. We need a ""left"" approach to make a big change, and it can be done swiftly. A significant portion of cartel money comes from marijuana trafficking (dwindling some in recent years due to state legalization). We can fix that right quick by switching to legal home grown. Cut the legs out from under them. And when needed, sure, go ahead and send police to bust the legit traffickers. So then we still have the problem of people getting hooked on fentanyl snuck into other drugs. Expand testing where people can get their drugs checked. Provide safe places where they can use with almost no risk of dying due to overdose.

Ah, my mistake. You're not backpedaling. You're just straight-up lying about what you said earlier to make your current lies sound less absurd.

There's no sense in which this is true, as 2020's election certification was subject to a violent insurrection which was aided and abetted by members of the House GOP.

> And since 2000 we’ve had contested elections (including 04, 08, 12) in some form

Well your second paragraph was ninja-edited in. Which isn't blameworthy in and of itself - I've ninja-edited posts. But the fact that you're attempting to impugn someone else based on failure to response to your ninja edits definitely makes your fundamental dishonesty that much more obvious.

But sure, let's respond to your second paragraph, which is apparently quite important:

So, let me make sure I'm getting your argument right - feel free to correct me here.

You're arguing that governing via executive order + court packing are meaningfully comparable to violent insurrections, frivolous lawsuits designed to derail elections, violent threats against poll workers, attempts to send fake electors to the College, etc?
