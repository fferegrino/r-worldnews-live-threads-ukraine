Day 306 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a bit less quiet day than usual, because there was one missile strike that happened around 7pm. We don’t know how many missiles they fired, but it was definitely more than one. I’m not sure what they were aiming at, but at least one of the missiles was intercepted by our air defense, which was the explosion that people heard here. The missile that was intercepted might have been aimed at Kharkiv, but others weren’t, as there were some reports about missiles landing somewhere in Kharkiv oblast.

The expected next big missile strike still hasn’t happened yet, which is great, and I think our new strike on Engels airbase might have just postponed that missile strike for quite some time. I hope we get some photos of the damage that was done to the airbase soon. Hopefully we will be able to see if any of the bombers were destroyed or at least damaged, I guess if they are evacuating them to airbases far to the east, then at least some damage must have been done and they don’t feel safe anymore.

It looks like rumors about our forces already being in Kreminna didn’t turn out to be true in the end, but there is definitely some movement happening in there, as we are getting new footage of fighting in the forests around Kreminna, which means our forces are getting closer to the town. The fact that Russians are evacuating their officers from Kreminna also tells us a lot, they probably don’t think that they can hold it for long and of course their officers would run first, they don’t care about their troops. Their soldiers will love that move, seeing your commanders run for their lives a great morale boost.

Russia has a national “air defence day”, where the purpose of this day is to celebrate how good their air defence is.

The Ukrainians then flew straight up to one of Russia’s most valuable airports, launched two missiles and killed a number of Russian pilots.

The way they look at it, you never give your enemy accurate intel for free, and the rest of the world is the enemy, since even if they aren't directly at war with it, they are still competing with it, all the time (just like any hyper-competitive assholes you may have had the misfortune to meet in real life, they don't really have any friends).

So they lie per doctrine. All the time, about true things and false things. Any intel at all is intel, so they lie about every single thing. The idea is that after reading what they have to say you know less than when you started. I'm surprised they spoke of hitting the airbase at all. Assume every thing they have to say though is a lie. So your question becomes irrelevant, in a way: there may or may not have beed a drone attack, or a plane attack, or a missile attack, or a bomb planted, or an accidental fire, or a Russian missile misfire, or a malfunctioning plane exploded, or a gas leak. Russians may have been killed, or not, and planes or buildings hit, or not, or AA defenses used, successfully or unsuccessfully. They may have been shooting at birds they thought were stealth bombers. Who knows?

The only thing we know for sure is whatever they said happened didn't happen, because at minimum someone lied to cover their ass. Then their superior lied to cover their ass.

First, she and her handler/escort blatantly broke the rules.  She’s been working in a war zone for months—the onus is on *her* to comply—not the military, not her handler, *her.*  She and her escort/handler (1) proceed to a no-go zone to interview the farmer, and (2) didn’t even wait for their documents to be approved to be in the region, anyways.  She takes zero responsibility for this—it’s everyone else’s fault.  Mostly, her handler—a total newbie—for letting them set off towards something in a no-go zone. And another journalist previously interviewed them, so must be ok? And her DR boss wanted interview, so must be ok? Take some accountability, lady.  It’s not your escorts fault. Or your boss. Or the slow office. Or the other journalist.  Or the guards at the checkpoint. Or the farmer.  

Second, she thinks that since she placed some phone calls and they told her procedures and various people advocated for her reinstatement, she’s *entitled* to reinstatement. She’s not.  She’s there at the approval of Ukraine.

Third, she proceeds to insult Ukrainians for not understanding her Danish jokes. That she sarcastically posts about Putin, and Ukraine shouldn’t take that seriously.  Lady, this is war.  Act professional.

Fourth, she absolutely did herself no favors by having a history of covering annexed territories in such a way that didn’t make abundantly clear that Ukraine has “been wronged” by Russian aggression, including displacing thousands of people who are now not in those places to represent the extreme *dis*pleasure at annexation. 
Since she’s been there so long, she should know how incredibly sensitive Ukraine is regarding coverage of stories from occupied- Donetsk and Crimea.  They expect to make extremely clear that it’s all morally wrong and a criminal state—any “straight journalism” from there is considered by the Ukrainians to be pro-Russia.  Why does she think she’s the only one in Donetsk in 2017?  All other journalists know that can’t be unbiased/straight there or else UA finds you suspicious.  And she didn’t have a solid justification or explanation for Crimea.  She instead showed parades? Happy faces? Prosperity? What the heck, lady?  

Fifth, she’s offered some friendly advice—“go make some clearly pro-Ukrainian articles, or at least fb posts, so we know you’re not pro-Russia, and we’ll take that under consideration if you appeal.”  Does she do that?  Nope.  And a load of excuses why she hasn’t, that are—frankly—bs.

Could the Russians mass tens of thousands of poorly trained troops, scrape together some armor and transport and invade from Belarus again? Sure but the chances of making it even as far as they did in the initial invasion are slim to none. In February they had better trained, far better equipped troops and the element of surprise. Ukraine defeated them with dogged determination, some bayracktar's, artillery and a pile of Javelins.

The troops currently guarding the northern border with Belarus are not the best trained or equipped soldiers Ukraine has now but there are more of them than in February, they have had a chance to dig in and would know the invasion is coming. If Russia couldn't even take Kyiv when they had the advantage in men and material I don't see how they succeed when they are now at a clear disadvantage and their enemy will be ready.

Putting on my armchair generals hat I would be shocked if the Russians made it halfway to Kyiv. As for separating Ukraine in two? That's a fucking pipe dream.

Edit: And I don't think there will be any new Russian push from Belarus anyway. Russia is just using Belarus to train troops since so much of their training capacity has been lost by attrition in Ukraine and making it look like there is a slight chance they might cross the border again fixes some extra Ukrainian troops in place. If you already have troops training across the border making some noise that you're going to attack is a no brainer for Russia so of course they are. It is in fact a rare example of Russia employing some good strategy for once, not that it is likely to have any effect on the outcome of the war but you still might as well tie up some of your enemies forces if it will take little to no extra effort.",1672104854.0,1672103880.0,t3_zvejwo,t1_j1sbjd2,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

(I have no real information on this incident)

It makes sense to assume Ukraine would try to destroy or disable the bombers that carry missiles into Ukraine.    At a airfield/airport you would have both pilots and aircraft.  

The Russian attitude would be exactly the opposite of a US Air Force attitude.  We (USA) would respond with ""ha ha you didn't get anyone"" if the missiles hit empty planes.  We can just replace the equipment.  Russian Federation thinks they won if the planes are undamaged.  Russia can just replace the pilots.  

When you shoot down planes or drones they are still going down.  There was an incident by Okinawa in WWII where an American pilot shot the tail and half of a wing off of a Japanese kamikaze.  The flaming mess that was left spiral flopped into the magazine of the destroyer it was attacking and cause a large detonation.  All hands below deck sank.  Quite likely the plane would have missed the ship entirely if it had not been shot down.  The pilot, wingman, and AA crews were called back to Washington to testify.  The Navy was worried that Japan had developed some sort of new missile system that could one shot annihilate ships.  It was just really bad luck.  That plane was identical to other kamikaze planes until the tail and wing were removed.",False,1672064183.0,t3_zvejwo,t1_j1pxod3,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

Your argument is that because Gen Z is so radically different from boomers that Gen Z won't ""put up with"" the behavior of autocratic heads of state launching wars. This idea supposes that if boomers hadn't ""put up with"" such, we could have already ended it. This conclusion requires us to deliberately ignore the boomers experience during the Vietnam War era.

Wrong, I even stated earlier that we've seen a global decline in the willingness to die in wars for the ambitions of tyrants and that the boomers' resistance to Vietnam is an example of this trajectory. To your final point, I am not one of the people who thinks that all wars are started to funnel money upwards into the pockets of a few billionaires, so yes, I do make that distinction. Every war the US is involved in, even the ones it starts, has arguably more complex origins (even when they're started directly for the benefit of the MIC) simply because the organization of the US government is not autocratic or despotic.",False,1672098794.0,t3_zvejwo,t1_j1rbn5l,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
