>GEN. MILLEY: ...What's the military problem to solve here with the air power? And it's control of the airspace, and you can do that two ways. **You can do that air-to-air or you can do that from the ground to the air.**

>In terms of the most effective and efficient and cost-effective way to do that right now for the Ukrainians is from ground to air through air defense systems, and that's what they've been provided from the beginning if this war 'til now. And that's important, because what you want to do is protect those assault forces from Russian close-air support and/or attack-helicopter support, and they've got air defense systems, the Ru- -- Ukrainians do, that can do that.

>The casualties that the Ukrainians are suffering on this offensive are not so much from Russian airpower; they're from minefields, minefields that are covered with direct fire from anti-tank hunter-killer teams, that sort of thing. So it's minefields. So the problem to solve is minefields, not the air piece right this minute. And that's what the coalition is trying to provide them: additional mine clearing, MICLICs, line charges, Bangalores -- that sort of thing, in order to continue to work their way through the minefields.

>So I'm confident that they can do this, and especially if they execute the tactics, techniques and procedures that they've been taught, which they are doing, and execute these operations at night, which would deny the Russians the ability to use any of their airpower anyway. So the real problem is the minefields. It's not right now the AirPower.

>Now, having said that, just do a quick math drill here. **Ten F-16s are $2 billion, so the Russians have hundreds of fourth- and fifth-generation airframes. So if they're going to try to match the Russians one for one, or even, you know, two-to-one, you're talking about a large number of aircraft. That's going to take years to train the pilots, years to do the maintenance and sustainment, years to generate that degree of financial support to do that. You're talking way more billions of dollars than has already been generated.**

>So the key thing is to focus on air defense, focus on the blocking-and-tackling sort of offensive combined arms maneuver, which is artillery, as both long-range and short-range artillery, and then get in your engineers and your mine-breaching equipment. That's the kind of stuff they need. That's what they want. That's what they're asking for.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-19-23/index.html

""Russian President Vladimir Putin called the West's failure to comply with Moscow’s demands to extend the UN-brokered Black Sea Grain initiative “arrogance and impudence,” and says his country would consider returning if conditions are met.

“Just outright arrogance and impudence. Promises and empty chatter. And they only compromised themselves with this,” Putin said during a remote meeting with the members of the government broadcast on Wednesday. “The authority was undermined, among other things, of the leadership of the UN secretariat, which actually acted as a guarantor of the grain deal.”

Moscow had shown “miracles of endurance and tolerance,” by continuously extending the deal in the past, the Russian president said.

“The West has done everything to derail the grain deal, they have not spared their efforts,” he said, adding Russia was obstructed from donating fertilizers to the poorest countries.

Putin also said Moscow would consider the possibility of returning to the deal if all the principles in it, without exception, are taken into account and implemented.

“The continuation of the grain deal in the form in which it existed has lost all meaning. That is why we objected to the further extension of this so-called deal,” he said. “All obstacles must be removed for Russian banks, financial institutions that aid the supply of food and fertilizers. This includes their immediate connection to the SWIFT international banking settlement system.”

“We don't need promises and ideas in this regard. We need the fulfillment of these conditions,"" he added.""",False,1689792844.0,t3_153k31i,t3_153k31i,,0,38,0,38,0,0,

The fear of escalation allows Russia to lob missiles/drones over its borders into civilian centres without any fear of returned fire.

So why does Ukraine need them- he indicates they aren't necessary. In the flat fields of Zap, they have to completely clear the trenches in advance of demining as a few Russians with some anti tank weaponry can take out demining machines and tanks from kilometers away.

Why not shell and or drone those Russians to death? Well they are trying to completely clear trenches before advancing to avoid this problem, but often they have to do this with foot soldiers which takes time. Also some of the hard point fortifications are  10ft deep concrete bunkers and you need the heavy air bombs, the jdams, to take them out easily. 

 The other reason for the planes according to the Atlantic is that they can see over the horizon and so force Russian aviation with their jdams to back off. 

I agree they are expensive, but the Ukrainians cannot be left to completely run out of aircraft either.

Panama Helt — The cargo ship, owned by the Tallinn-based Vista Shipping Agency, sank off the coast of Ukraine on 2 March 2022, likely after striking a mine.[107] The Panama Maritime Authority later reported that the ship was sunk by a Russian missile.

Marshall Islands Yasa Jupiter — The bulk carrier, owned by the Turkish Ya-Sa Holding, was struck by a missile fired by Russian forces in the Black Sea off Odesa, Ukraine on 24 February 2022 and was damaged. She was on a voyage from the Dniepr to Constanța, Romania.[95][96]

Moldova Millennial Spirit — The chemical tanker was shelled in the Black Sea off the coast of Ukraine on 25 February 2022. Its crew of ten were rescued.[97]

Panama Namura Queen — The cargo ship was struck in the Black Sea off the coast of Ukraine by a missile fired by Russian forces on 25 February 2022.[98] There was no casualties reported and ship remains afloat.[99]

Dominica Azburg — The cargo ship was shelled and sunk on 4 April 2022 during the Battle of Mariupol, after being damaged the day before by two Russian missiles. One crew member was injured.

The Montreux Convention does not only apply to Turkey. All of the signatories guarantee the safe passage of other countries ships in exchange for safe passage of their own.



Clearly, Turkey has been playing nice, not calling any of those incidents a violation of the treaty, even though they clearly are. 



A new and bolder incident could easily prompt Turkey in to declaring Russia in violation of the Montreux Convention, and therefore no longer protected by it. With a few spoken words, Turkey could close the Bosphorus to all Russian commercial traffic.

Even Nabiullina admits to the bad economic situation in Russia:

&#x200B;

>Russia’s Central Bank said Thursday that the ruble’s weakening was brought on by falling export proceeds.  
>  
>“We see that when our exchange rate weakens, various conspiracies arise about how \[the ruble\] is deliberated weakened to increase budget revenues… But we must look, first of all, at the dynamics of foreign trade,” Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.  
>  
>Nabiullina explained that the ruble — which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine — managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.  
>  
>“If we compare the positive current account in the first quarter \[of 2023\], then compared to last year's peak, it fell five times, so the floating rate is changing under the influence of foreign trade,” Nabiullina added.  
>  
>The ruble has traded with extreme volatility in the 16 months since Russia invaded Ukraine as the West has targeted Moscow’s foreign currency reserves and crucial energy exports through sanctions designed to cripple Russia’s economy.  
>  
>Nabiullina highlighted the potential inflationary risks stemming from the continued depreciation of the ruble, emphasizing that such factors would be taken into account during the Central Bank’s upcoming meeting where it will decide whether to adjust its key rate, which has remained steady at 7.5% since September.",False,1689805883.0,t3_153k31i,t1_jsnfwsd,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

Helping Ukraine defend itself against a Russian attack and liberate their territory has strong support in the West. But enabling Ukraine to strike into Russian territory, however justified that may be from a strategic, military point of view, has far less public support.

A Western leader who gives Ukraine a lot of long range weapons and says ""Do with them what you want."" would jeopardize public support for military aid alltogether.

But I think that, fortunately, Putin's regime will not survive if Russian troops are expelled from all occupied territories, especially Crimea. The new Russian government will then pragmatically make peace.",False,1689748841.0,t3_153k31i,t1_jsk1rkm,,1,32,0,32,0,0,

If you fly at 10m above the ground, then things like pylons, buildings, tall trees, big hills are all factors. What's also a factor is even if you have GPWS and an accurate terrain map, you have to change altitude to hug the ground and that both slows you down and makes you manoeuvre more and all of these are factors in being detected and intercepted. There's also a chance of skylining your aircraft as you crest over a hill and being pinged very visibly on radar.

Remember also that many of these cruise missiles are running mid 20th century guidance technology. It's not that good at flying complex routes.

Russia wanted all of Ukraine, or at least to replace the leadership with more pliant subjects, or at least to prevent Ukraine from moving further West, or at least to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Russia already had a big chunk of territory in Donbas and Crimea, they've since acquired some more.

It's so funny to me that people look at the destruction of a damn (which although tragic is a completely localized incident) and then they take the response to that and go ""well I suppose a nuclear power plant blowing up and literally blowing radiation on NATO countries would have the same response clearly"".

As a response to ""no jets"".

Firstly Russian military doctrine is ALWAYS focused on saturation of ground based anti-air platforms. Just giving Ukraine some jets does literally fuck all. They would be in the same operational capacity they do now in regards to how sorties need to be flown (low and quick). The western missles mounted on the plane are arguably more important then the jet.

Also comparing global sanctions, countries training troops, and literally billions of dollars of weapons, armour, and ammo sent this is as far from ""appeasement"" as possible.

It's mostly representatives of NATO and not NATO itself, as NATO, as an official entity, can only respond to concrete evidence and facts. Otherwise they'll lose their credibility.

And honestly speaking, there is actually little risk of a ZNPP explosion. The NGO and independent IAEA said 'There are no mines on any vital infrastructure of the ZNPP.', an explosion wouldn't be beneficial for Russia in any measure. The only source claiming plans for an attack is the Ukrainian SBU. In this case, their info is not very reliable and is countered by independent reports from the premise.

Lastly, you're somewhat right regarding your comparison with Chernobyl. Chernobyl put much more radiated particles into the air as the ZNPP could. But it is important to mention that during the Chernobyl explosion, an unusual strong southern wind blew the radioactive particles north, north west.

One of those exceptions is when Turkey is at war.  Another is that warships of a country that is at war may not pass through the straights except to return to their home base, hence Russia's Black Sea fleet is currently stuck in the Black Sea and its other fleets cannot currently enter the Black Sea.

Under the Convention, warships of countries not at war (such as the US, as of right now) continue to be permitted passage subject to standard peacetime restrictions (regarding eg notice, tonnage and duration of stay within the Black Sea).

HOWEVER, when closing the straights to Russian warships last year, the announcement by the Turkish government was more ambiguous and appeared to ban passage by warships of all nations.

>Russia’s Central Bank said Thursday that the ruble’s weakening was brought on by falling export proceeds.

>“We see that when our exchange rate weakens, various conspiracies arise about how \[the ruble\] is deliberated weakened to increase budget revenues… But we must look, first of all, at the dynamics of foreign trade,” Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.

>Nabiullina explained that the ruble — which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine — managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.
