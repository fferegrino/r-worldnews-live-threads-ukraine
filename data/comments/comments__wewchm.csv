Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 3 August 2022
 

- As a result of a Ukrainian strike against a Russian ammunition train in Kherson oblast, southern Ukraine, it is highly unlikely the rail link connecting Kherson with Crimea remains operational. Russian forces are likely to repair the railway line within a few days, although it will remain a vulnerability for Russian forces and their logistical resupply route from Crimea into Kherson.


- Russia has promoted the ferry crossing recently established to replace the damaged Antonovsky Bridge over the Dnipro River in Kherson for civilian use. However, Russian military forces will almost certainly utilise it for troop movements and logistical resupply.


- It is likely we will see an increase in civilians attempting to flee Kherson and the surrounding area as hostilities continue and food shortages worsen. This will create pressure on transport nodes and routes, likely resulting in measures to control movement being implemented.

🪖 The battle lines didn’t move much on Tuesday,  but [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1554652287276093440), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554511395852615680.html),  and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554598719219187712.html) go over all the action of the day.  Tuesday's guest assessment is by [Jomini](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554647160804851712.html).

🪖 I usually start these summaries off with “the battle lines didn’t move much” statements.  Here is what that means: 

> On Tuesday, the tiny little Ukrainian village of Pisky, really just a suburb of Donetsk where the airport used to be, was pressed by russian troops.  The Ukrainian troops only [had two mortars](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1554565411122954249) in the area against superior russian artillery — no HIMARS, no m777s, no Panzerhaubitze 2000s, just two dinky mortars against enough russian artillery to lay out over 6,000 shells on the tiny village over the course of the battle.

> After a fierce and bloody fight, russia broke the Ukrainian line and took the city.  There were [massive losses](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1554567134008823808) on both sides — truly “[hell](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554552814092828677)”.  

> Ukraine regrouped, rushed in fresh troops and a new battle ensued.  And after another fierce and bloody fight, the Ukrainian troops forced the exhausted russians [to retreat](https://twitter.com/WarMonitor3/status/1554575155543810054).  

> At least in Pisky, Tuesday ended with no territory gained or lost.  And if you read all that and think, “Jesus, someone could make a movie out of that…”, remember that is what “The battle lines didn’t move much on Tuesday” entails.  And every day there are a dozen such Piskys in Ukraine.

🚧  Ukrainians in Kherson are starting to find leaflets with instructions on [what to do](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1554491323058737158.html) during the forthcoming liberation. 

🚧  The official score of blown up russian munition trains now stands at Ukraine-1, [russia-1](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPR/status/1554630777287106562). 

👉 The security service of Ukraine took down [a million dollar bot farm](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554570371399122945) operating out of Ukraine.  The farm was owned by a [russian national](https://twitter.com/7Stork7/status/1554425666149416963) living in Kyiv and was spreading disinformation about Ukraine on the Internet.

👉 The supreme court of russia [ruled “Azov”](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1554439202133123073) a “terrorist organization”.  Ukraine pointed out that the decision is meaningless as Azov operates solely within the confines of [Ukraine’s borders](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554538944301355008). 

👉 russia agreed to hand over the bodies of the executed Azov prisoners of war, but only after it finishes its “[investigation](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554189840710877184)”.  russia is continuing to refuse the International Red Cross access to the site of the execution as required by the Geneva convention.  russia has also not handed over a list of [dead and wounded prisoners](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554488312886337536) although a list that russia has posted publicly has been [partially confirmed](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554571890450219010).

👉  The first trainload of [mandatory evacuees](https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine/status/1554625596344266753) from the Donetsk Oblast has made it to safety.  “Mandatory” is a bit of a misnomer as it’s possible to stay after being made aware of the risks and signing a waiver.

💰🇧🇪 Belgium froze €50 billion euros in russian cash and stock owned by 1,229 sanctioned individuals and 110 entities.  Previously only €13.8 billion euros in assets had been frozen in the entire EU.

🇪🇸🎁 Due to unsatisfactory condition, Spain has decided [not to transfer](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554473738405642246) its Leopard tanks to Ukraine.

🎁 Ukraine’s ‘Army of Drones’ initiative raises over [$20 million](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554672341531099136) for the purchase and repair of drones for the Ukrainian troops!

🌾  It’s a minor point now, but the first cargo ship with Ukrainian grain [arrived in Istanbul](https://twitter.com/OlKubrakov/status/1554540978530394112) safely.  Meanwhile [Ukrainian farmers](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1554490092483395584)…
 
🌾🇱🇧  A few days ago it was reported that Lebanon [seized a ship](https://twitter.com/StratcomCentre/status/1553780024842543112) carrying stollen Ukrainian grain.  On Tuesday, Ukraine proposed that [Lebanon purchase that grain](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1554575729358262272).

👉 Ukraine stated it has [not lost a single HIMARS](https://twitter.com/DEFENSEEXPRESS/status/1554523332850098176) in the war, despite [compelling russian evidence](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554058264903847937) to the contrary that [27 of the 16](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1554058192207880193) deployed HIMARS have been destroyed.

Day 161 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, but the missiles in the morning were aimed at Kharkiv this time. For some reason they only fired 2 missiles, honestly we got more worried because they fired so little of them, we thought there would be a second wave, but it didn’t happen. With those 2 missiles they hit a factory with one and nothing with the other, it hit the ground, though there were residential buildings nearby, so they might have been aiming at them.

I haven’t written about Russian insanity for some time, so here’s some stuff that happened with our relatives from Russia. Couple of days ago, on the day of the Russian Navy (the holiday) my mom’s brother wrote to us, longing about celebrating it together with us and my grandpa, who was an officer in the Soviet Navy, which is why we celebrated it before. He literally wrote to us about celebrating our killers, how clueless can you be? Read the room for fuck sake.  

He also wrote about how grandpa would love to celebrate it if he was alive. No, no he fucking wouldn’t, that Navy is the one firing cruise missiles at us. The fact that the people who he, and our family, knew could be the ones killing our people right now is just mind boggling. He served in both Sevastopol and Severomorsk (a closed town-military base) over 40 years ago and the people our family knew from Severomorsk are complete zombies that celebrate killing Ukrainians.

I guess it might be a good thing that he didn’t live long enough to see the second coming of the Nazis, he survived the first one in the occupation, then served in the army that would become the new Nazis in the future. Actually they might have got to him even after death, Russians fired some missiles very close to the cemetery he’s in, and our friends who have been to another cemetery close to his said that it has been destroyed by shelling, and that there are coffins lying on the ground everywhere, it has to be one terrible sight.",False,1659559516.0,t3_wewchm,t3_wewchm,,0,138,0,138,1,0,

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO (more on this).

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack / leak domestic opposition's data (""Russia, if you're listening..."").

- Trump extorted Zelenskyy who was requesting aid in exchange for dirt on Joe Biden (leading to Abuse of Power impeachment of Trump).

- In 2018, 8 Congressional Republicans flew to Moscow (On July 4th) and met with their government officials in a closed-door meeting.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting, voting Republican, or 3rd-party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties as it stands). Every Democrat should be railing Republicans, particularly Trump, over this nonstop. And despite them rapidly going into damage-control, remind them that Democrats were, once again, ahead of the curve on this issue in telling them so.

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO.

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

They would've had to use a lot of resources and tropps inside their territory, to prevent any further attack and also to handle civilians panic. Imagine the economic, logistic and morale disaster for them to handle.

The US continued training troops and telling Ukraine that Russia would not invade invade. Russia was broke, a joke and to much of a bitch now to invade and after crimea this retoric continued saying they was a special unfortunate situation. Trump was wanted a return for everything ala art of the deal, exactly the dumb shit everyone expected of him. Classical geopolitical thought on Russia shifted because of bipartisan warhawks taking Russia's weakend state as a sign they were incapable or even afraid to enforce their stated redline. Another person who believed predicted this outcome is the current CIA director William Burns who was ambassador to Russia and knows Putin and all the Kremlin players personally. Most of the Republicans are jumping for joy that their is a new war to keep the weapons manufactures in their states flush with tax payer dollars and the recent no votes against aid haven't been reported on kindly by the left or the right. Rand Pual knew the aid package would pass but wanted it on record that his sole objection was there should be some sort of tracking of the weapons because of the law of unintended consequences that always accompanies US interventions.
