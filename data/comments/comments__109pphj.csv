>  
>In Soledar in eastern Ukraine, both sides sought to control the narrative of a bloody fight for the salt mining town near the fiercely contested city of Bakhmut, where a Russian advance could give Moscow a symbolic win.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, meanwhile, reported Thursday morning that more than a hundred Russian service members were killed in the area.

The figures provide Russia’s sobering measure of the economic costs of President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, which the Kremlin has sought to minimize. The costs, in blood and treasure, are mounting and expected to rise even further in 2023.

>  
>Warsaw and London have yet to finalize such a move, but doing so would meet a demand Kyiv has been making almost since the start of the war and support potential offensives against Russian forces in the coming months. Poland would require a sign-off from Berlin to send its German-made tanks.  
>  
>Defense officials in the United States and Europe have long held concerns that giving Ukraine tanks would signal more direct Western involvement in the war and could prompt President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into escalation.  
>  
>On Wednesday, the president of Poland said that his country was prepared to send German-made Leopard II tanks to Ukraine if an “international coalition” agreed to do so. No such Western-made battle tanks have been sent to Ukraine since the invasion.  
>  
>Poland had already decided to include the Leopards as part of a package from the coalition, President Andrzej Duda said, speaking at a joint news conference in Lviv with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and President Gitanas Nausėda of Lithuania. Mr. Duda added that he hoped the tanks would “soon flow through various routes to Ukraine.”  
>  
>Mr. Duda did not specify which countries might be involved in such a coalition. But Polish officials have urged Western nations several times this week to band together and jointly send more modern tanks to bolster Ukraine’s diminishing supply of Soviet-era tanks.  
>  
>Germany has long resisted sending Ukraine offensive weaponry out of concerns about escalating the war and said it would not be the first NATO ally to send tanks. And, out of ethical concerns, Germany places limits on its vast, lucrative arms exports and their re-export, so its agreement is required for Poland or any other country to send Ukraine the German-made Leopards.  
>  
>Mr. Zelensky said on Wednesday that Ukraine expected a “joint decision” on the transfer of the tanks and that it would take donations from several countries to meet the needs of Ukrainian forces. “One state cannot help us with Leopards, because we are fighting against thousands of tanks of the Russian Federation,” he said.  
>  
>The mounting pressure on Berlin comes a day after Britain said it was considering sending Challenger II tanks. No decision has yet been made on whether the Challenger II tanks — reportedly as few as 10 — will be donated to Ukraine.  
>  
>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, expressed hope that the floodgates had been opened for the West to send battle tanks after France, the United States and Germany agreed in quick succession last week to send lighter armored fighting vehicles: AMX-10 RC reconnaissance vehicles from France, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles from the U.S., and Marder Infantry Fighting Vehicles from Germany.  
>  
>Germany’s decision to send the Marders marked a significant shift in Berlin’s approach, and the armored vehicles pledged by the three countries are some of the most advanced Ukraine has received since the start of the war. Still, they fall short of the capabilities of battle tanks like the Leopards, which analysts say could be key for Ukraine to push beyond the grinding attrition that has defined the war this winter.

>  
>Russian forces have been in Soledar before, and their return — and Kremlin claims of progress in taking the town — might not signal a collapse of Ukrainian lines, according to soldiers who have fought in the now deserted town and military analysts.  
>  
>There are competing claims over control of Soledar, as has been the case in previous zones of urban combat. Early in the war, for example, Ukrainian authorities claimed control of the Kyiv suburb of Irpin, though street fighting persisted for several days before the Ukrainian Army solidified its hold.  
>  
>In the chaos of urban warfare and fierce house-to-house fighting, it can be hard to tell who controls what at any moment, soldiers say. With both sides frequently changing positions to avoid artillery, there can be a swirl of confusing firefights.  
>  
>“In Soledar, we are in one building and the enemy is in the next,” Lt. Vadym Maksymets, a platoon commander in Ukraine’s 93rd Mechanized Brigade who fought in Soledar last fall, said in an interview on Wednesday.  
>  
>“There is shooting back and forth,” Lieutenant Maksymets said of typical street battles in the small town. “One moment we attack, the next they attack,” he added. “When we were there in November, it was street-by-street fighting.”  
>  
>In some senses, it is easier to fight in the city than on the trench lines around it, he said, because there is protection in ruined buildings. “In the city, you have cover,” Lieutenant Maksymets said. “In the forest, you need to build all of it.”  
>  
>In addition, soldiers on the offensive in urban areas need to outnumber defenders by a greater ratio than in the fields, he said. But, he said, “there are a lot of Russians there” in Soledar.  
>  
>He described one firefight in which he had retreated from a position in the morning, only to return and recapture it in the afternoon. He was pleased that “then we spent the night there,” he said.  
>  
>That isn’t to suggest that such feats are easy or simple.  
>  
>Pvt. Oleksiy Kondakov, a Ukrainian soldier who fought in the fields south of Soledar for three months until rotating out in early December, said in an interview that he had been involved in combat near two tactically important sites — at a road junction and a destroyed gas station — and had fired mortars into the town when the Russian forces were there.  
>  
>“You hear only explosions and the whistle of artillery,” he said, describing “the smell of smoke and death all the time.”

Main points:

1. Prison recruits proved to be substantially more motivated and ""brave"" than general mobiks. While mobiks have no idea what they are doing there and have zero motivation to fight, prisoners seek to fight to earn money for their families and prove that they are not ""complete failures and criminals"".
2. Rusarmy took note of that and started to recruit prisoners themselves in past few weeks. In particular, another PMC called ""Redut"" (which is closely affiliated with Rusarmy) started to recruit prisoners quite aggressively.
3. There are reports that after being recruited, prisoners first go to Rostov for a 2 week training before being thrown directly to the front. But that's only on paper, lots of indications tell us that the so-called training lasts a week max.
4. Generally, prisoners make a 6-month contracts with Wagner, but there are reports of shorter 3-month contracts for prisoners who were going to be released soon.
5. Recent Wagner announcement of the first pool of prisoners who finished their contracts and were released back home might have been a PR stunt, but there are actual indications that at least several prisoners have indeed returned back home and were amnestied.
6. Some of the prisoner recruits that conversed with Meduza journalists claim that Wagner leaders didn't value their lives whatsoever, ordering them to storm Ukrainian positions with only a gun and 4 magazines of ammo. They say that dozens of their fellow prisoner recruits were dying on their eyes every day.

18f77564ecd9869810e28b55000462e1,109pphj,j42q3ap,"Soledar armchair analysis, January 12

*([previous analysis from two days ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1080153/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j3t96yf/))*

The fog of war is thick. Russians were claiming to be in complete control of Soledar for days, while Ukrainians encouraged calm and posted some videos from the western outskirts. Ukrainians just now reported a successful counter-attack, claiming that they retook the train station and the 'mine' which is likely Mine #3 on the western side of town. Lots of analyses and a wide range of best-guess maps are floating around. My personal assessment is that as of this second not one single person on Earth has the true accurate information on where all the troops from both sides are. The situation is so fluid even the most accurate line on a map will become obsolete within hours. 

Russians still have not posted anything geolocated further west than the 'administration building' video from days ago. 

There have been still-unconfirmed reports about a Ukrainian rear guard of about 100 that had surrendered after being surrounded in the high-rises in the Eastern part of town that Russia almost certainly still controls. There have also been reports of a Ukrainian strike hitting a concentration of about that many Russians.

Multiple videos posted by Madyar give us the best glimpse of what's been happening in Soledar in the past 48 hours. Obviously a carefully managed slice, they do show large groups of Russian infantry advancing on foot with light weapons. Whereas they previously most often attacked in 5-man groups, we are now seeing groups of 20-30 Russians break up into groups of 8 and perhaps even work together. 

The fog of war has also lifted enough for us to get a better idea of how we got here. The lines around Soledar have been mostly static for months, with Russia mounting constant anemic attacks by poorly trained, poorly equipped 5-man squads interspersed with constant shelling of Ukrainian positions. 

The sudden Russian break-through came on January 3rd when they managed to push through Ukrainian defenses on both flanks around Soledar. This does constitute both an intelligence and a command failure on the Ukrainian side, both of which are very human. Cold and tired, under constant attack, men naturally fall into a routine and became complacent. We can assume that January 3 was the day when Russia switched up their tactics and used larger units of better trained, better equipped, better motivated infantry. Ukrainian intelligence failed to spot the build-up, and command on the ground failed to react in time. The two flanking pincers were a huge boon for Russia because they gained control of the high ground overlooking Soledar from both north and south. 

Russia is also apparently using drones with artillery effectively. We've seen videos of Ukrainians destroy their drone teams, and we also see both Russian and Ukrainian videos of extremely precise Russian hits. This means that Ukrainians likely got the second unpleasant surprise at the same time, finding their units on the low ground overlooked by multiple drone teams linked with better-than-before artillery. 

What can we expect in the future?

* The loss of (most of) Soledar once again shows the value of the element of surprise. Now that Ukraine has settled down after being surprised, Russia is less likely to pull off another major surprise in the coming weeks. 

* Russian situation cannot be accurately gauged. The fact they stopped attacking and the lines stopped moving may mean they're out of steam but I think that's wishful thinking. They are likely regrouping for another try which may or may not come at Soledar. 

* Ukrainians are under a lot of pressure to preserve men and equipment. Retaking Soledar feels impossible without first securing their flanks. Ukrainians missed the chance to hit the Russians a week ago, and by now are likely facing heavy battles and blankets of artillery on the heights, which may not be worth it.

* The strategic value of Soledar is minimal. It's likely not worth wasting precious vehicles and even more precious Ukrainian lives. Ukrainians may instead work to solidify new lines of defense, and hopefully be better prepared for future Russian attacks.

* Russia continues to mobilize and deploy more men. Their forces in theater grew from 250 to 280 BTGs just in the past week. With the shake-up in high command we should expect more surprises and more sectors of the front where Russia will be able to concentrate enough manpower and artillery to push back Ukrainian defenses. 

* Ukraine has been making slow but steady progress towards the strategic Svatove-Kreminna highway. In the past few months they took a few Soledar-tier targets without much fanfare, and are now apparently on the outskirts or inside Kreminna itself. Kreminna has more strategic value than Bakhmut, much less Soledar.",False,1673552508.0,t3_109pphj,t3_109pphj,,0,99,0,99,0,0,

So as of an hour ago, Ukraine still claims parts of Soledar as contested, likely the Western portion.

edit: ISW frames it this way:

> The elevation of Gerasimov and the Russian MoD over Surovikin, a favorite of Prigozhin and the siloviki faction, **is additionally highly likely to have been in part a political decision to reassert the primacy of the Russian MoD in an internal Russian power struggle**. The Russian MoD and the siloviki faction, often most publicly represented by Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, have feuded throughout 2022 on Russia’s conduct of the war in Ukraine. Prigozhin has increasingly criticized the Russian MoD’s conduct of the war since late 2022.[8] **Igor Girkin, former commander of Russian militants in Donbas and a prominent milblogger heavily implied that he would support the removal of Russian President Vladimir Putin from office** in his most direct criticism of Putin to date on January 10.[9] Surovikin, the previous theater commander in Ukraine, was a public favorite of Prigozhin, and Ukrainian intelligence reported Surovikin is a rival of Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.[10] It is unclear why Putin implicitly demoted Surovikin in favor of Gerasimov, unlike previously replaced Russian theater commanders who were blamed for battlefield setbacks. Gerasimov’s elevation is likely in part a political move to weaken the influence of the broadly anti-MoD siloviki faction and a signal for Prigozhin and other actors to reduce their criticism of the MoD.
> 
> Putin’s elevation of Gerasimov and the highly criticized Russian MoD may prompt siloviki like Prigozhin to further carve up the Russian information space and push back on the Kremlin’s conduct of the war, however. Prigozhin has relentlessly promoted the Wagner Group at the expense of the Russian MoD’s reputation and may double down on his flashy advertisements on Russian social media and state-affiliated outlets to assert the superiority of his forces.[11] Gerasimov's centralizing efforts will additionally likely face resistance from Prigozhin and other actors eager to retain their private stakes in the war in Ukraine. Prigozhin may have known of Putin’s decision to reappoint these commanders and attempted to preempt this news by amplifying information about Wagner’s efforts to seize Soledar in the past several days to claim a victory.[12] Putin’s decision to elevate the MoD may also signal Putin’s departure from attempts to appease siloviki-affiliated milbloggers in an effort to regain control over the dominant narrative. ISW will continue to monitor the sentiment among different milblogger factions regarding their ability to criticize the Russian MoD or Russian military commanders.",1673501835.0,1673496844.0,t3_109pphj,t3_109pphj,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

>Such is the degeneration of Russia’s regular forces following nearly 11 months of war that Wagner was estimated by the west this week to account for “a quarter or more of Russian combatants” in Ukraine.

>Prigozhin and Surovikin are allies, who many believe hope to usurp the Kremlin military establishment of Gerasimov and his immediate boss, defence minister Sergei Shoigu.

>Sir Lawrence Freedman, author of Command, a book about the politics of military operations, said: “My suspicion is that this is a move by the old guard against what was seen to be a Prigozhin-Surovikin axis, prompted by Wagner’s propaganda about the Soledar-Bakhmut battle and complaints about Gerasimov’s lack of support.”

Not just for Surovkin, this would be too big of a job for Alexander the Great. They need more men at the top to manage it. They're moving men around Surovkin while maintaining the overall hierarchy. Remember that Russia is still not at war, so they have to do an extra dance to give people ""special"" duties.

Gerasimov was Surovkin's nominal boss all along. This is the default move, the result of taking things how they already are, and just putting new labels on them.

Now both these MBTs are fighting without the massive amount of Air superiority and against massed artillery. do not be surprised if you see all the challenger and leopard 2 PLs blown to bits at some point and probably on some RU propaganda video.

No, its not hundreds each for most of them, but that kind of also is by design.

Yes, its also a case of Western Europe having built down military capacity, but its **also** the fact that the Leo 2's are expected to perform better than its counterparts, by an order of magnitudes.

One Leo 2, is really in the hands of a capable operator with the other elements of combined arms in place too, worth a lot of T-72's and likely 5-10 T-90's. At the least. So if the ball starts rolling, as it indeed looks to be, it will definetly be possible to scrounge up 50-100 Leo 2's relatively fast (over the next few months) and that *is* a formidable force, that by itself along with the Bradley's, Marders and the French Light tanks will negate any risk of a last Russian attempt at a grand scale armored thrust. And it will absolutely put in the hands of Ukraine the final elements on the ground side of modern nato-style combined arms.

They'll get more as they master them and by late summer we will see the equivalent of what would have happened if several NATO mechanized expeditionary corps' rolled into Ukraine to take on the Russians. With any luck the discussion will by then long ago have passed on to F-16's and deliveries already have started (and we know pilots have been training on them since October at least.

From what reports have emerged, my impression is that it was simply that they threw enough troops all at once, with a high-enough concentration of professionals, to provide a break-through. The last couple months, Russia has been very happy to throw plentiful mobik lives at Bakhmut and to a lesser extent Soledar, but far less willing to risk professional soldiers. It seems the need for some kind of a PR victory pushed the risk equation here.

Now, all the hand-wringing online about Soledar misses the point that Ukraine is happy to trade limited gains for asymmetrical attrition. Russia has gained a couple square miles at most, out of 230,000+ that Ukraine contains. And Russia this whole war has been bad at consolidating recent gains. They tend to lose stuff they just took.

I think the focus on Bakhmut is mostly due to Prigozhin trying to make a political argument that his Wagner forces are more effective than MoD forces. But with so many lives spent there, Bakhmut has become somewhat of a symbol. Ukraine has a careful balancing act of defending Bakhmut to try to deny Russia this single PR victory, without spoiling their asymmetric advantage as defenders.

From where I sit it is impossible to estimate the lives expended on either side. I worry Ukraine has become as emotionally invested in Bakhmut as Russia is, and will spend too many resources there for what is ultimately not a tactically important site. But ultimately if I was Ukraine, this is what I would want: Russia pushing straight into prepared defenses for months on end. If Russia is willing to risk more professional soldiers, they probably will be more successful at making territorial gains. However, they are also expending a far more strategically significant resource than the lives of mobiks.",False,1673554644.0,t3_109pphj,t1_j42r9js,,2,22,0,22,0,0,

Now by listening to Prigozhin , Kadyrov, and overall pro-war people who said that the ministry of defense waging the war wrong, Putin appointed Surovikin as was suggested by many, all he managed to do is to leave Kherson and use rockets on attacks with very doubtful military effect. He is not the first to replace Gerasimov , Dvornikov was also tried as operational commander of the war before that, for a short period of 7 weeks. 

Keep in mind that Putin knows Gerasimov for a minimum of a decade and he is in his closest circle of trust, now that Putin tried to put in charge someone else and that's failed multiple times , it becomes clear that the problem is  not in generals, and their demotion was premature, to win the ministry of defense back Putin now restoring their position in hopes for their loyalty in future in return.",False,1673503842.0,t3_109pphj,t1_j3zv1yk,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

For this war to end by military means, those supplies will need to become exhausted. The only thing we've seen actually work to slowing Russia down is HIMARS strikes on frontline ammo depots. 

In my armchair-general view, in order to really slow this shit down, Ukraine will need to do some strategic strikes to cripple Russia's ability to wage war.  And unfortunately, Ukraine has not been given the weapons to do this.  (yet).  

I agree with the common speculation that Russia's days of strategic strikes are nearing an end. They exhausted their long-range cruise missiles, and have slowed their rate of terrorist strikes. 

Ukraine needs to destroy Russia's factories, and cripple their manufacturing. 

I think that if Ukraine finally gets the heavy armor that they're apparently about to receive, that may also change the dynamics on the battlefield, and allow them to actually capture and recover territory.

National security is something nation states crave.

Plus, again, you can't just ship unlimited gear to a country and expect it to be useful. Training takes a ton of time, logistics make it a nightmare, etc. There's a reason the EU has been sending soviet style gear most of the time: Ukraine has the ability to use it without much overhead.

Ukraine doesn't have some legion of bored tank crews waiting around for want of a tank, either. Every man they pull back to retrain on new equipment is one less on a precarious front line vs hordes of Russian mobilized conscripts.
