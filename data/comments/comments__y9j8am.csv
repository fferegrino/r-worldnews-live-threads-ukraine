Day 240 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with a missile strike, something that hasn’t happened in quite a long time. At 8am there were posts saying that Russians are launching missiles from Kherson, but a couple of minutes later 3 missiles hit Kharkiv, it was pretty unexpected and quite loud. They very rarely fire missiles at us in the morning, the vast majority of times it happens either in the evening or at night.
 
We are not sure if the missiles that hit our city came from Kherson of not, because there were no posts about incoming missiles from Belgorod before we got hit. But it’s also pretty hard to see the missiles being launched against the blue sky, so maybe nobody noticed them because of that. The missiles hit some factory, injuring 6 people, but thankfully without killing anyone. They also hit us with missiles again at 10:15am, not sure what they were targeting that time, but they injured 3 more people.

They didn’t have to wait too long for our response, because at 5:15pm we already hit one of their factories and a substation in Belgorod oblast. The fire was really big, as even people from Belgorod, which is about 25km away, could see it. I really like how quickly our army responds to Russian missile strikes. They need to understand that now for every missile strike on Kharkiv they will be hit back. Maybe that will make them think twice before sending missiles in our direction.",False,1666400075.0,t3_y9j8am,t3_y9j8am,,0,152,0,152,1,0,

>But the rancor of the debate itself reflects the deep changes that have already taken place. Of all the Western democracies, Germany made the biggest bet on Russian trade and Russian gas, as well as the biggest bet on Putin’s rationality. Germany is now paying the largest economic price for the war too. Support for the Ukrainian military defense nevertheless remains very strong. In a September poll, 70 percent of Germans surveyed still said they want to help Ukraine win even if it means higher energy prices.
>
>Scholz himself recently spoke about the Russian “crusade” against liberal democracy, acknowledging that Putin is committed to the destruction of the world in which Germany formerly existed and prospered. Schmidt likes to say that the vigor of the argument about tanks and other weapons in Germany reflects the fact that Germans are not used to leadership, that they are still “in our teenage years,” no longer followers but not quite ready to lead.
>
>He is clearly right, though I would put it differently: In truth, some Germans are ready to lead, some Germans have re-learned the lessons of history, and some Germans are beginning to convince their compatriots that the world has changed, and that they have to change along with it. They haven’t quite won that argument yet.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 21 October 2022
 

- On 14 October 2022, Belarussian president Aleksandr Lukashenko said that 70,000 Belarusian troops and up to 15,000 Russians would be involved in a new Russian-Belarussian Group of Forces. On 15 October 2022, the Belarussian authorities released a video claiming to show the arrival of Russian troops in Belarus. However, to date it is unlikely that Russia has actually deployed a significant number of extra troops into Belarus.

- Russia is unlikely to be able to generate combat-ready formations of the claimed size: its forces are committed in Ukraine. The Belarussian military highly likely maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations.

- The announcement is likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarussian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.",False,1666338407.0,t3_y9j8am,t3_y9j8am,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

“I’m not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,” Sen. Shelby told Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin. “I’m saying that we should all strive for a better relationship.”

This was the day after it was reported two more victims were exposed to Novichok in Salisbury, and the senate intelligence committee confirmed intelligence reports of Russia’s election interference. 

A year and a half later all Senate Republicans besides Mitt Romney would acquit Trump after he was impeached for witholding vital military aid from Ukraine, pressuring Zelenskyy to interfere in the 2020 elections, by launching fake investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden. 

There are a million reasons to vote in the midterms. Just don’t forget it’s not just Americans that will be affected. Republicans might seem to support Ukraine because it’s in their best interests atm, but they will gladly accept Russian money to lift sanctions or limit military aid as soon as they get the chance.

I don't know if this has been published here before but this is a 2 hours video with a BBC reporter interviewing Ekaterina Schulmann who is an extremely popular and competent Russian political scientist and blogger. Was an interesting watch. I personally found it surprising when she said that ""Previously the Russian elites were foreigners and the peasantry were natives, nowadays it's the other way around"" and this was in regards to the Soviet heritage in current decisionmaking. She thought that the special operation is a way for Putin to bind even the future generations of Russians to this sort of government by basically making them pariahs and ruining their reputation with every country.

To make this retreat work as well as possible under the circumstances, Russia needs two things: 

1. They need a shitload of civilian shields from Kherson interspersed with the convoy to keep the way out safe. The Russians could compel people through force, but that eats up time and resources they don’t have. 

2. They need to create a credible reason for Ukraine not to follow and take a big fat chunk out of the fleeing frontline troops. 

The dam threat accomplishes both. It ensures compliant civilians join the convoy to avoid getting caught in the flood, and it gives Ukrainian soldiers on the left bank pause to follow into potential flood zones. 

They can even let/instruct Ukrainian loyalists seek higher ground on the west bank and create additional cover for those retreating troops. Also the added bonus of a humanitarian crisis for the Ukrainians to mitigate when they eventually follow. 

To be clear, under these assumptions Russia probably doesn’t blow the dam. They just need to convince enough people in Kherson to think they might.",1666360106.0,1666328031.0,t3_y9j8am,t3_y9j8am,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

They're good at protecting a small highly critical area but the cost of ringing an entire city with them would be unbelievably costly compared to the area you could cover with a few surface to air missile systems. Cost estimates I could find for a Phalanx are in the [$10-15 million USD range](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/c-ram-an-advanced-automated-point-defense-gatling-gun) *per unit.* One [NASAMS battery is $23 million](https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/europe/2022/10/12/explained-the-iris-t-slm-and-nasams-air-defence-systems-ukraine-needs/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20one%20Nasams,costs%20more%20than%20%241.2%20million.) and can engage missiles out to 50 km and detect them up to 100 km

Sure ammunition is cheaper than missiles but it isn't free, the same source I listed above states the cost of a typical engagement shooting down a missile is $30,000-60,000 USD. NASAMS and IRIS T can shoot cheaper missiles cost $400,000 to $1.2 million for the long range AIM-120 for NASMAS but you have to take into account servicing your dozens of Phalanx's. Plus with their limited range an enemy could just send a missile above them. Only put them on one side of your city to save on costs and a cruise missile can be routed around them. I guess you could try and work it into a layered air defense but because they have such limited range Phalanx's essentially have to be set to always be on and active because there is no time to involve a human in the loop like a SAM system that has longer range. I feel that would complicate matters a lot because you might have Phalanx trying to engage targets on the edge of it's effective range which it then doesn't hit or you fire an expensive missile at something it does end up taking down.

All that is why you don't see anyone in the military talking about installing 100 Phalanx's around Kyiv. The upfront cost is hideous, the limited range is a huge handicap, the ammo is still a substantial cost and servicing so many systems would be a huge ongoing expense. I get that continuing to shoot down drones that cost tens of thousands at most with missiles that cost hundreds of thousands might not be practical but as it stands neither are a bunch of Phalanx's.

I feel like the [Vampire system](https://greydynamics.com/vampires-in-ukraine-l3s-new-rocket-system/) which is being deployed to Ukraine, or maybe already has been they don't reveal everything, is the best solution there is for cheap drones kamikaze or otherwise. The laser guided rocket it fires ""only"" costs $27,500 and it probably has a range double that of Phalanx but the system itself costs way less. Hard to find a number for the overall cost of the system but they keep using the phrase ""low cost"" in the literature so I can't imagine it would be much over $1 million maybe, maybe not even that, certainly well below what a Phalanx costs.

Finland and Sweden are absolutely de facto members now and probably have been for decades, in the sense that  an attack on either of them would have resulted in a response by many NATO countries if not the alliance itself. 

Ukraine is not similarly situated.

If MNNA means a country like Japan or Australia, Ukraine isn't quite there either. 

Even after all Ukrainian territory is liberated, the war won't end without a negotiated settlement and at that point Ukraine will formally be brought under a defense umbrella of some kind or another. 

Immediate or accelerated NATO membership is unlikely, because that is something Ukraine can give up in negotiations without actually losing the protection NATO would give. 

An obvious alternative would be a mutual defense pact that was limited to, for example, Ukraine, the UK, the Baltics, and Poland. That would be sufficient might to deter any future Russian invasion, and Putin could declare a victory against NATO expansion and US imperialism, Ukraine would remain safe, and the deal would keep moving forward.

 >The siege of Leningrad (Russian: блокада Ленинграда; German: Leningrader Blockade) was a prolonged military blockade undertaken by the Axis powers against the Soviet city of Leningrad (present-day Saint Petersburg) on the Eastern Front of World War II. Germany's Army Group North advanced from the south, while the German-allied Finnish army invaded from the north and completed the ring around the city. The siege began on 8 September 1941, when the Wehrmacht severed the last road to the city. Although Soviet forces managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, the Red Army did not lift the siege until 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began.
 
**[Driftwood theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driftwood_theory)** 
 
 >The driftwood theory (Finnish: ajopuuteoria, Swedish: drivvedsteorin) states that Finnish involvement in the Second World War as an aggressor was the cause of inadvertent decisions made on the basis of a limited choice of policies. The first arguments that Finland drifted into the Continuation War were made for the war responsibility trials in 1945 by the Hornborg committee, whose final report criticized Finnish political leadership for being passive and fatalistic. In the actual war responsibility trials of 1945–1946, the defense claimed that the defendants lacked active responsibility for the outbreak and continuation of the conflict.

Kherson is sort of unique because of how early it fell and was occupied making it fair to wonder how far along the Russians were in instituting a banking system for Russians, let alone Ukrainians they came to subjugate in contrast to a place like Severodonetsk, where evac orders were well in place, and those who could would have left.

The winter will already slow down the pace of the war, and blowing the dam would make even slower, so they would have time to catch their breath as it were. Right now, on the back foot, with Ukraine not really stopping their offensive, the Russians are having a hard time keeping up and they're effectively just throwing conscripts in the way as speedbumps for the time being. 

Even just from an internal political perspective, that's not sustainable at the current rate. They're losing control of the broader narrative and people are likely starting to really feel the impacts of the war more broadly thanks to mobilization and people fleeing russia to avoid mobilization. 

Based on what I've been reading and seeing in news reports the last while, Russia really needs more time than it needs anything else right this moment. Doing something crazy like blowing a dam would buy them that time. 

Even if they don't do it, but threaten that it may happen, they still buy time because Ukraine has to decide how many military personnel and how much equipment they want to risk in a potential catastrophic flood zone. It may mean Ukraine has to slow down the Kherson offensive and instead put more effort on taking and holding that hydro electric dam to then continue the Kherson offensive. 

It isn't ""good"" for either side if that damn blows up, but the Russian side has much more to lose in the short term and they're much more desperate so may be willing to accept a known quantity loss of their own making (crimea water supply issues) than take further risks that the UAF offensive continues to be effective before Russia can catch their breath and mount a new, well supplied, defensive line.",False,1666362841.0,t3_y9j8am,t1_it7h74n,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Putin isn’t crazy. He’s ignorant but not crazy. You just don’t understand his reasoning or logic. 

The invasion of Ukraine appears to be insane but it’s not if you look at the larger picture. 

When Russia went into Ukraine in 2014, they rolled over their military with ease. They expected the same this time. They assumed it would be done in a few days and they’d be fine. They’d take out Zelensky, install a puppet, have a parade, and start exploiting the natural resources for profit. 

When that didn’t happen, the mission became to take key areas. They assumed the Ukrainians would only be able to defend the areas they held and would lack the resources to take back areas effectively. They were wrong. 

Putin knew there was 0 risk to him personally by invading Ukraine. He didn’t care about the thousands of Russians he sent to die. He never has. He blew some up with bombs to get into power. 

He also didn’t care about the economic issues because Ukraine was going to provide a wealth of resources to more than make up for it. 

For him, invading Ukraine was all reward and no risk. He’s finding out that isn’t exactly true. The west’s reaction has been far greater than he expected. This has put them in a tight spot. What do they do now?

Now they wait and try to hold on to what they have until after the midterms in the states. They’re hoping the GOP will win and pull aid from Ukraine. That won’t happen but they’re hoping. 

However, Putin knows using a nuke, of any size, means the GOP wouldn’t be able to do that. He knows it means a response from the west that would cripple his military. A crippling conventional response to nukes would be far more embarrassing than Russia returning to Russia and giving Ukraine all of its land back.

The same reason the west has supply issues on everything at the moment.  We decided to deindustrialize and try to make everything  financially efficient.  The past 30 years has been a story of closure after closure of major ammunition factories.

Then add in smart weapon construction is measured in single units per day.  Many ammo types have the absolute minimum production line capable of sustaining itself - simply to keep the industry/tooling going.  No investment is made beyond the absolute bare minimum.

> Most likely they have begun production at some point after the invasion started.

You'd think so, wouldn't you?  Unfortunately that has only just started happening, and at a pathetic basis.  New factories need to be built from scratch and the west has yet to start.

That said - the west has utterly massive stockpiles of most ""dumb"" ammo.  We just don't have the ability to manufacture it in real time.

I don't think supply will be meaningful in this conflict - but hopefully this is a wakeup call to our political and military leadership that our industrial capabilities are by far our #1 strategic problem at the moment.  The west has utterly no capability to fight a sustained major conflict.  Period.

The US currently has the capability to manufacture about 10k 155mm rounds per month.  You can do the math from there.  75,357 M795 rounds were purchased in 2021 for example.  If you google around for random articles pre-2022 you will see a whole lot of ""above levels to sustain the manufacturing base"".",1666406621.0,1666406082.0,t3_y9j8am,t1_it9zsqg,,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,

And yeah, he was pretty awesome.  Taught me how to dice garlic when I was little.  Also, the guy cleaned his house gutters himself until he was 94 years old.  Only stopped because my dad insisted on it because he commented he would get dizzy while on the ladder.  (He washed skyscraper windows for a living before they had those baskets with the cranes...  What he did was open the window, attach a leather belt to two hooks on the outside, climb out and close the window behind him, then wash and climb back inside.  Dude has some wicked stories of things that went down that he was able to help with from that...  Tangentially, my favorite is a story about how he realized the company bosses were getting ready to steamroll his union while he was president of it.  He thought quick and kept everyone's wages and benefit demands from failing.)

Regardless, he didn't want to die at home; he wanted to die in the hospital.  (Hospitals don't like that in America, it gets reported to the government for statistical analysis.). His doctor insisted that he be sent home on hospice.  Grandpa's response was simply, 'nope,' and he refused to take his heart meds because he, ""wasn't getting paid overtime to live [that] long"". He died before his discharge time, *that day*, came.

Guy was a legend.

Oh, and there's the time he decided *not* to shoot the Nazi mayor of the town he was a POW in because the mayor had already shot himself (and his own wife, and tried to (unsuccessfully) shoot his daughter (she jumped out of the second story window) because the allies were coming.  -The reason was that the mayor had kicked him down a flight of stairs because he asked for new wooden inserts for his shoes, the old ones had cracked and we're cutting his feet.-

Grandpa was about to *make sure* the mayor was dead when he realized that there was a good chance that he might need that bullet later (he had also been feeding information to the allies - ""if they want a phone call, it's important; if the want a letter, it isn't,"").

At any rate, that's how I know the value of a bullet and the phrase, ""he's not worth the bullet,"" actually made a lot more sense to me than other kids growing up.

Unclear, but typically vote as whipped: Risch, Boozman, Crapo, Braun, Moran, Daines, Graham, Scott (SC), Rounds, Hagerty, Lummis, Marshall.  [The senators of ND, SD, IN and two from MT and ID are a little squad—they normally all vote the same, and it’s what Thune or Hoeven publicly says.  So Daines, Boozman, Braun, Crapo, Rounds are almost certainly with the leadership.] 12

New generation/obstinate to own leadership/subservient to Trump: Cotton, Scott (F), Marshall, Paul, Kennedy, Hyde-Smith, Cruz, Lee, Hawley, Blackburn, Tubbeville. 11

Unknown: Vance?, Johnson?, NCguy?, Oz? NHcandidate?, AZcandidate? Laxalt? 7  [The thing is, these guys learn in orientation that if they won’t be whipped, ie comply w leadership, then the leadership won’t bring their legislation to committee or the floor.  That’s how it works.  It’s supposed to make them compliant from day 1.  It angers a few, and they’re forever unwieldy, like Paul or Cruz.

Using nukes doesn't win him the war as he doesn't have the forces to take advantage of any gaps in the line they would create. Even nuking a city probably doesn't get Ukraine to surrender. What using a nuke does do is get the US more directly involved in the war, they announced they've told Russia what their response would be.
I would assume it would be using airpower to attack Russian forces in Ukraine, if that's the case Russia loses that war in a real hurry. It also loses Russia every single ""friend"" they have left, India and probably even China would buy less oil. And it risks increasing internal problems within Russia for Putin. Does using a nuke make even Putin's inner circle think he's gone to far? They don't want to die because Putin risked starting world war 3.

Plus Putin keeps saying how the war is to save Russians in Ukraine from Ukranian Nazi's, how's he supposed to keep up that pretense by nuking the country he says he's trying to save? Russia denies every war crime they commit in Ukraine and blames it on them, well they don't have nukes so Russia couldn't deny it. Using a nuke risks more Russians finally realizing they're the bad guy, with the tensions mobilization has already caused who knows what might happen internally in Russia if they used a nuke.

Also lots of people were saying an invasion was imminent before February and getting that right does not make you automatically right about everything else to do with the conflict.

Anyway using nuclear weapons makes Putin's power less secure in Russia and doesn't win him the war anyway. Putin is not insane and he won't use a nuke for fear of further destabilizing his regime.

Kessler in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.

The reality of the situation is that Putin can try to influence those norms through military might and petulant contrarianism all he wants, but there is a reason why those modes of influence have fallen to the wayside under the weight of the west's ideological and economic unity.  This has nothing to do with fairness or morality or high minded idealism - it is cold, hard reality.  Putin tilting at half the world's GDP, 80% of its military might and damn near 100% of it's dominant culture.

We all stand on the same soil and breath the same air, and share the same history as a planet.  Maybe the reason these other would-be superpowers can't break through their own glass ceiling is because they are so blinded by knee jerk opposition to western liberalism, that they refuse to understand how it has come to dominate the developed world, and that any ""oppression"" which arises from it is self-imposed.

He wanted to take back Ukraine and it blew up in his face, it's not going to happen and of course he'll be lucky to hold onto any of it at all long term.

He's viewed as the one that rescued Russia from the chaos of the 90's and stabilized things.

A dictator does need some base of support in the population, if everyone turns against him that could be the end of him. If he uses a nuke and US air power kicks their ass back to Russia it's another humiliation, that risks destabilizing his regime.

There are no ""immigrants"" coming from Ukraine right now. People are fleeing war. They are refugees running from the Russians.

But then Russians fucked up so bad they had to draft people.

I will just say that between fear of death, and fear of the government, the latter clearly won for russians. 

For Ukraine death of this soldier- is one of the best outcomes. At least this enemy soldier will not kill, steal or rape anyone ever again. 

The only better outcome for everyone - is if Russia and their people just relised that they MUST avoid going to Ukraine at all costs, and stopped going there.

Not really. Most effective resistance to established dictatorship regimes does not build in the country itself. It builds with the material support of other countries, without which regime change is usually impossible. Until that support exists, it's worthless suicide to speak up. People who resist the dictatorship from the inside tend to be those whose families have already been killed by the dictatorship - they usually already don't have much to lose by the time they flip the switch.

The fact that you are willing to believe this without requiring a fairly rigorous amount of evidence proving it is the height of laziness.

Man are you so wrong. If you had spent some time in any nearby country, you would find plenty of uninformed people voicing such complaints. Not a majority of population in any of these countries, but if you would use them as voters in an election, you'd be on the verge of having enough to get into the parliaments of those respective countries.

It takes a lot of effort to find the truth in Russia. Banned sites, firewalls, censorship, information overload... It's hard to find the truth about minor scandals about politicians or celebrities in the western countries. Situation in Russia makes this 10x harder.

>They had 100 of choices

Choices with their own consequences, which you know nothing about. Imagine if Russia managed to suppress the changes in Ukraine, and you were in a puppet state, that would send you to fight against Moldova. Would you go? Knowing that you could be beaten or tortured if you refused and then sent anyway. Knowing that they could hurt your family. Or would you go if you knew absolutely nothing about what's going on in that conflict? You probably have an excuse for eveything prepared in your head, but you have no real experience with facing the negative consequences of such choice.

>For Ukraine death of this soldier- is one of the best outcomes. At least this enemy soldier will not kill, steal or rape anyone ever again.

That's where you're wrong. Russians, who disagree with their leadership, and who would at most begrudgingly kill Ukrainian soldiers in firefight, are what Russia needs to change from within. If those people die, then only brainwashed and nationalist people will remain. People like the guy that sparked this discussion aren't the leaders. They can't set an example, but there are far too few such honorable people left in Russia. Meanwhile guys, who silently disagree with Russian leadership, there are more of them still present in Russia. Given an example, a leader, a spark - they could be a force which could at least start a positive change. Without them, Russia is doomed to remain a barbaric state.

And that will be the case, if Russia doesn't change, then the threat of conflict with Russia will loom over Ukraine for generations to come. Russia as it is today will never stand by and watch idly.
