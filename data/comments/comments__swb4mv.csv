* According to Zelesnky, Ukraine demands to move from a policy of appeasement to ensuring security and peace guarantees in Ukraine.
* Zelensky noted that he instructed the Foreign Ministry to convene a summit of the countries participating in the Budapest Memorandum, and if **it does not take place or does not provide Ukraine with security guarantees, it will be recognized by Kiev as invalid along with the clauses signed in 1994.**

Please don't shoot (downvote) the messenger. 

""For a day now, Kiev has been shelling the DPR and LPR. Thousands of refugees, women with children are fleeing the war,"" the politician stated, noting that none of the participants of the Munich Security Conference was concerned about this issue. ""It seems ridiculous to the German Chancellor what is happening in the DPR and LPR. He doesn't consider it genocide. An inexplicable and cynical statement, given the history of Germany,"" the speaker said.

At the same time, he continued, Western politicians threaten sanctions of unprecedented proportions, ""if Russia stands up to protect its citizens and compatriots living in the DPR and LPR,"" instead of showing concern for the fate and lives of people, trying to ""justify the behavior of Kiev.""

""On sanctions. Firstly, they do not frighten anyone - we have been living in such conditions for 8 years. Yes, it creates problems, it is better to cooperate and develop relationships than to conflict. But it was not our choice to introduce restrictions,"" Volodin continued. ""Secondly, everyone came to understand: there will still be sanctions against Russia,"" he added


Volodin also stated that Washington and Brussels will always find something to accuse Moscow of, regardless of its actions and plans. ""[Russian President] Vladimir Putin spoke about this yesterday at a press conference after a meeting with [Belarusian President] Alexander Lukashenko. The reason is one thing - they want to stop the development of our country,"" he explained.

""We must not allow this to happen. At the next meeting of the State Duma, we will discuss these issues,"" Volodin concluded.

Zelenskyy wants to avoid a run on the banks. 

At the same time, Zelenskyy wants sanctions imposed on Russia now before they invade. The West thinks that’s the catalyst that may spark an immediate invasion. The U.S and U.K think the threat of sanctions are a deterrent. 

Also, Germany has an enormous role in how this plays out. Olaf Scholz is being very coy about everything. Germany is heavily dependent on Russia for energy. If Russia cuts Germany off from its natural gas/oil, Germany would very quickly enter an energy crisis. Scholz has hinted or implied that Nordstream 2 may be cancelled if Russia invades, but he hasn’t said those exact words. Likely because he fears an energy crisis ensuing. Nordstream 2 is the biggest piece in all of this. Russia experts and Academics strongly suspect that Putin has invested A LOT of his own money into Nordstream 2. This potentially gives Germany a lot of leverage in deterring a Russian invasion.

TLDR; Germany has a lot of leverage in preventing a Ukrainian invasion, but they are also essentially held hostage by Russian energy at the same time.",1645286162.0,1645285968.0,t3_swb4mv,t3_swb4mv,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

Cripple the economy, the morale, and the function of Ukraine; remove ukrainian leadership and install pro-Russian politicians where applicable. Gain access to the sea and Ukraine while never actually ""sending in the Russian military"".

A long, drawn out boa constrictor.

Edit: Downvotes why?

It is literally one of only 3 possibilities.

1. Russia officially invades.

2. Russia goes home and apologises.

3. Russia never actually crosses into Ukraine with the full might of it's military and instead tries to choke out Ukraine.

There are only 3 options: Peace, War, and Siege that's basically War anyway. The last option give's Russia the dumbest pf deniability with ""we never _actually_ invaded.""

There's more ways to choke out a country than literally stopping supply lines to it. Cripple the value of its currency, cyber attacks on critical aspects of government function (already underway), make international business investments look like a terrible opportunity. Destroy vital infastructure... ALL of which can be done without sending one official russian soldier across the border.

And it's not a mistake. Every single word choice is very intentional. 

There's no justifiable excuse for this word choice.

972334d72a38fbf9cfa4b96cbf0324f2,swb4mv,hxlysgl,"I have a theory as to why this is happening. The *real* reason Putin is invading Ukraine is because he wants to send China a message. He wants Xi and the rest of the CCP to see that Russia is no pushover, especially with the threat of NATO. It's all about making Russia look as intimidating as it was 40 years ago when the West was paranoic towards them. This was around the same time the USSR was China's only gateway to the rest of the world as it recovered from the atrocious effects of Maoism, which I'll add to later.

Think of China as Rome, Russia as Ireland, and Putin as Prasutagus – a Celtic chieftain the Romans respected enough to allow him to rule his own village for the time being. When Prasutagus died the Romans took over his lands and raped/killed his widow Boudica for resisting. Likewise, the day Putin is no longer in power is the day China invades Russian Siberia. He's the only reason why China hasn't invaded, but they will soon; China's population is growing and they're low on raw material. What better source of gas and ore to reap from than their neighbor north of them? >!(No, not Mongolia.)!<

[The CCP does not respect the concept of democracy.](https://hbr.org/2021/05/what-the-west-gets-wrong-about-china) They spit on it and has made anti-democratic rhetoric a mandatory aspect of their educational curriculum. Thus, when the Soviet Union fell, China became the only authoritarian regime of any significance left in the world. It was easier said than done but China quickly rose as an economical powerhouse through Dengist policies and exploiting around 15% of its own people (roughly 100 million around the 80s) by opening its market to the West. Cold and ruthless, the CCP made full use of its power and succeeded the USSR as the new threat to the West, which – by virtue of its new form of governance – now includes Russia.

There's a reason why the FSB (the modern KGB) got involved in the 2016 elections: Trump was the candidate crazy enough to wage war with China, and that's exactly what Putin wanted.",1645297285.0,1645297210.0,t3_swb4mv,t3_swb4mv,,0,-17,0,-17,0,0,

This escalation was always going to happen.

Russia used this time to accumulate more troops and supplies, and get them into position.

c39c724bf4316e1a329bd66efff6fd32,swb4mv,hxleblx,"ANYWHERE YOU turn in Moscow, it's easy to find members of the Russian elite who wonder why the West thinks that war in Ukraine is the Kremlin’s preferred course of action. Even if the Russian army managed to force Kyiv into a swift and humiliating defeat without too many casualties, the damage to Russia’s national interests would surely outweigh any potential military gains.

The problem is that the same logic was just as true eight years ago when the fateful decisions were made to annex Crimea and to stir conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region. The fact that Russia has been able to endure the international fallout for all these years helps to explain why the region finds itself again on the brink of war.

When it comes to Ukraine, people in Moscow and the West can be forgiven for assuming that the Kremlin’s policy is informed by a dispassionate strategy derived from endless hours of interagency debate and the weighing of pros and cons. What actually drives the Kremlin are the tough ideas and interests of a small group of longtime lieutenants to President Vladimir Putin, as well as those of the Russian leader himself. Emboldened by perceptions of the West’s terminal decline, no one in this group loses much sleep about the prospect of an open-ended confrontation with America and Europe. In fact, the core members of this group would all be among the main beneficiaries of a deeper schism.

Consider Mr Putin’s war cabinet, which is the locus of most decision-making. It consists of Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Security Council; Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the FSB (the main successor agency of the KGB intelligence service); Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service; and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Their average age is 68 years old and they have a lot in common. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which Mr Putin famously described as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, was the defining episode of their adult lives. Four out of five have a KGB background, with three, including the president himself, coming from the ranks of counterintelligence. It is these hardened men, not polished diplomats like Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who run the country’s foreign policy.

In recent years members of this group have become very vocal. Messrs Patrushev and Naryshkin frequently give lengthy interviews articulating their views on global developments and Russia’s international role. According to them, the American-led order is in deep crisis thanks to the failure of Western democracy and internal conflicts spurred by the promotion of tolerance, multiculturalism and respect for the rights of minorities. A new multipolar order is taking shape that reflects an unstoppable shift in power to authoritarian regimes that support traditional values. A feisty, resurgent Russia is a pioneering force behind the arrival of this new order, along with a rising China. Given the state of affairs in western countries, the pair contend, it's only natural that they seek to contain Russia and to install pro-Western regimes in former Soviet republics. The West’s ultimate goal of a colour revolution in Russia itself would lead to the country’s conclusive collapse.

Washington sees unfinished business in Russia’s persistence and success, according to Mr Putin’s entourage. As America’s power wanes, its methods are becoming more aggressive. This is why the West cannot be trusted. The best way to ensure the safety of Russia’s existing political regime and to advance its national interests is to keep America off balance.

Seen this way, Ukraine is the central battleground of the struggle. The stakes could not be higher. Should Moscow allow that country to be fully absorbed into a western sphere of influence, Russia’s endurance as a great power will itself be under threat. On a personal level, the world view of the hard men is an odd amalgam of Soviet nostalgia, great-power chauvinism and the trappings of the Russian Orthodox faith. The fact that the new elite in Kyiv glorifies the Ukrainian nationalists of the 20th century and thumb their noses at Moscow is a huge personal affront.

Why then are the people around Putin not scared about possible fallout from a new round of far-reaching economic sanctions? In their eyes, the sanctions that the West imposed to punish Russia for the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas were intended largely to check Russia’s rise. America and its allies would have found a way to introduce them one way or another, they were just looking for an excuse. Since 2014 such views have solidified. Messrs Patrushev, Bortnikov and Naryshkin all find themselves on the U.S. Treasury’s blacklist already, along with many other members of Mr Putin’s inner circle. There is no way back for them to the West’s creature comforts. They are destined to end their lives in Fortress Russia, with their assets and their relatives alongside them.

As for sanctions by sector, including those that President Joe Biden’s team plans to impose should Russia invade Ukraine, these may end up largely strengthening the hard men’s grip on the national economy. Import substitution efforts have generated large flows of budget funds that are controlled by the coterie and their proxies, including through Rostec. The massive state conglomerate is run by a friend of Mr Putin’s from his KGB days in East Germany, Sergey Chemezov. In a similar vein, a ban on food imports from countries that have sanctioned Russia has led to spectacular growth in Russian agribusiness. The sector is overseen by Mr Patrushev’s elder son Dmitry, who is Mr Putin’s agriculture minister.

Similarly much-touted financial sanctions have led to a bigger role for state-owned banks which, unsurprisingly enough, are also filled with KGB veterans. If anything, further sanctions wouldn’t just fail to hurt Mr Putin’s war cabinet, they would secure its members' place as the top beneficiaries of Russia’s deepening economic autarky. The same logic is true of domestic politics: as the country descends into a near-permanent state of siege, the security services will be the most important pillar of the regime. That further cements the hard men’s grip on the country.

After two years of covid-induced self-isolation for Kremlin bosses, there is a clear tendency toward tunnel vision and a dearth of checks and balances. Russia’s interests are increasingly becoming conflated with the personal interests of the people at the very top of the system.",False,1645288856.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxldtay,,1,58,0,58,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

4de5d4e9e8e84253f3a2dac17f25a52c,swb4mv,hxmc14i,"Really broadly:

For most of the last few centuries, up until the fall of the USSR, Russia has had control over Ukraine. Between the 90s and 2013, the Ukrainian government was nominally independent but still very closely tied to the Kremlin.

I’m 2013, Ukraines government announced it would stop pursuing EU membership in favour of even more robust ties with Russia. This led to a protest movement, which became the Revolution of Dignity, or Maidan revolution. Afterwards, Ukraine’s government has been pivoting towards ties with the west, including EU and NATO membership.

Russia feared the loss of one of their few remaining “warm water” ports (those which are not bound by ice for large portions of the year) in Sevastopol, on the Crimean peninsula. A pro-Russian separatist movement in Crimea gained momentum, and we learned as things progressed they were supported by Russian military. Shortly thereafter, Crimea held a sham referendum under Russian supervision to declare themselves independent of Ukraine, and the following day, joined the Russian federation.

Meanwhile, pro-Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine increasingly militarized and captured several cities and swathes of land, and have contested them ever since.

In the past year, talk of Ukraine joining NATO seemingly accelerated. Russia deeply opposed this, as it would further cement Ukraine as a western aligned state, and give NATO access to the Russian border along the European plain. 

Currently, despite talks, Ukraine is not eligible for NATO membership, as one of the conditions is not having territorial disputes (for example Crimea or the eastern regions). Russia fears that if Ukraine regains controls of those eastern regions, they will be admitted to NATO and be effectively beyond Russian control forever.

Russia has responded in recent months by building up a massive ground force along the border between Russia and Ukraine, as well as within Belarus to the north (Belarus is very much Russian aligned). The rebel separatist groups have been emboldened and reinforced by this, and the fear is that the Russian and Belarusian militaries will sweep into Ukraine and seize the eastern regions in a similar (but more direct and violent) way to the Crimean annexation. Furthermore, western intelligence indicates that Russia may even push to capture Kyiv in order to annex the entire country, or install a puppet regime akin to Belarus.

The current Russian force along the border is believed to be large enough to accomplish this, as well as actively prepared to do so. NATO member states and other western aligned powers have been supplying the Ukrainian military with large amounts of military aid (ammunition, anti-tank missile systems, training, etc) for months now, in order to prepare them to resist Russian invasion. The outlook for Ukraine is grim, but NATO has indicated it will absolutely not directly involve themselves with their own militaries. Active conflict between NATO militaries and the Russian Federation would almost certainly lead to world war, and the danger of escalation to nuclear conflict. 

Western nations have indicated a willingness to impose economic sanctions on Russia if they do invade, which have the real potential to utterly cripple the Russian economy. Complicating this is the fact Western Europe receives much of their petroleum and natural gas supply in trade with Russia, and a massive natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany called Nordstream 2 is nearly completed.

In Western Europe and North America, the danger to the average citizen is low in terms of physical safety. Unless NATO militaries directly engage Russia, or Russia pushes through Ukraine and into Poland (or invades the Baltic States), this is largely a regional conflict. There is always the chance it escalates to that, but it would be incredibly costly for both sides and it doesn’t seem to be in Russias plans.

Global oil and natural gas prices are of concern for everyone. If the supply of Russian gas into Western Europe is interrupted, many nations will be scrambling to secure supply of LNG (liquified natural gas) from other sources (the United States and Canada are likely candidates) in order to ensure their peoples homes are heated and powered. As a Canadian in a gas producing region, I can tell you even this is complicated as our limited pipeline system drastically reduces our ability to bring LNG to tidewater for international trade. Expect prices to rise substantially for heating and electricity.

Of course the gravest concern is for the safety of the Ukrainian people and their ongoing freedom and independence. This is still a far more complex issue than I’ve covered, but I hope it helps.",False,1645302714.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxm8h2s,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

0645d7b629a8355a8fd4d78837e26c07,swb4mv,hxmfgel,"**Backstory:**

Ukraine has a tormented history, having been conquered by the Ottoman Turks, then conquered by Russia, then lost a war for independence, then were conquered by Germany in WW2, then reclaimed by Russia again. When the USSR collapsed they finally found independence

Ukraine sits between NATO and their rival, Russia.

Ukraine's society is split along geographical lines, with western regions favoring Western democracies & NATO, and eastern regions favoring Russia.

Some years back, the far eastern portion of Ukraine declared independence, as the Republic of Crimea. This separatist faction, favoring Russian rule, basically handed Crimea over to Russia. The western regions of Ukraine reject the legitimacy of these actions, and consider this an illegal occupation by Russia.

**Now:**

In recent months, there have been growing talks about Ukraine joining NATO to protect themselves from further advances by Russia.

Russia views this as a hostile action, as the move would result in NATO directly bordering Russia whereas previously Ukraine had served as a neutral party separating the two opposing forces.

Existing peace accords promised that neither NATO nor Russia would lay claim to Ukraine, but the Western faction views these treaties as having already been violated by the Crimea situation.

Over the past few weeks, Russia has been building an enormous military presence along the border, both in Russia and in the Russian-allied neighboring nation of Belarus. Western forces have been sending military supplies to Ukraine, as well as increasing their own troop presence to dissuade any Russian incursions.

Russia has been making claims of a genocide taking place in Ukraine, suggesting that they should enter Ukraine to intervene. The US has been claiming that Russia is making false claims and that Russia will potentially stage a false-flag event to feign justification for invasion. Cyberattacks have gone back and forth. Threats have been made by Russia against pretty much every Western-aligned faction across the globe.

**The future:**

It could be that any day now, Russia will invade and conquer Ukraine. If the US tried to intervene, there is no doubt that the result would be World War 3, and obliteration.

Most likely if Russia were to invade, the US would simply pull back and stand by uselessly as Ukraine falls. Russia knows this.

Russia also knows that the US has suffered a serious blow to its reputation with the fall of Afghanistan last year. The US appears very weak, and its allies don't feel they can rely on the US anymore.

Russia also knows that the media is massively influential on both public perception and on politician's internal perception. Russia can move troops around innocuously and the media will go wild, hyping up a bold story to get as many clicks as possible. Fear and uncertainty will swell among the public, and even the politicians will fall in line with whatever narrative the media claim. Our society is very open to manipulation and exploitation. Russia knows that fear and distrust are extremely powerful.

They can send us into a panic attack that WW3 is imminent, and then pull back, claim total innocence, and watch as our society has to come to terms with our own manipulation by our media, and our lack of confidence in our leadership.

It's surely no coincidence that the first occurrence of Havana Syndrome inside the gates of the White House this week. It's to let us know that we are not safe. Even the White House can't protect itself from whatever system Russia has in place that is causing the mysterious ailment. This is an overt attempt to inspire fear.

Whether Russia intends to move forward with an invasion, or is merely using this as an opportunity to toy with our weaknesses and undermine Western forces, only time will tell.",1645304528.0,1645304209.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxm8h2s,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Because they are not part of NATO but has intention to do it.

What has Putin to gain. Well, he needs to secure some sort of permanent frontier geographically, which would be Dnieper river so the enemy just cant attack russias heartland. 

Furthermore, it would also give him land access to Krim. The eastern half of Ukraine is also the most russian speaking part of Ukraine with the most fertile land and resources.

Finally, i could see him proclaim east ukraine as an independent country/satelite state like Belarus and thus he still has a buffer between russia and nato while still having ""won"" something.

Russia will get sanctioned but already now there are talks about not cutting them out of SWIFT which would be economic suicide for Russia which would set a very dangerous trajectory for the world and Russia.

Two things i see can happen. 
1. Russia breaks apart which to some would sound like a good idea but we will have to remember that we are talking about the country with the most nuclear weapons.

 >A dirty bomb or radiological dispersal device is a speculative radiological weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives. The purpose of the weapon is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material, serving primarily as an area denial device against civilians. It is, however, not to be confused with a nuclear explosion, such as a fission bomb, which by releasing nuclear energy produces blast effects far in excess of what is achievable by the use of conventional explosives.

1) “Taking Taiwan” is not the kind of thing you can decide to do in an instant. It’s a massive technically difficult military invasion that would make D Day look easy against an enemy that literally has the high ground and has had the last eighty years to dig in.

2) China isn’t going to win against Taiwan, or increase its odds of winning by striking when the US is “distracted” (which it isn’t, see below). If there is a plan that China has in connection with the Russia-Ukraine affair then it is that by either encouraging US isolationism or drawing in more resources to Eastern Europe it can discourage the US from extending security guarantees in the Asia-Pacific over the course of the next half decade, just in time for it to have an aircraft carrier or two it can park off Taiwan’s coast. 

3) the US is on alert for this kind of thing. If you’re thinking it, they’re thinking it. China would be foolish to try anything.

Second, geopolitically it shows that a conflict has arisen that has truly divided the globe and that conflict is so great, leaders are willing to potentially kill millions of people over it.

99bbf61ff9de15fe9900a4fa8b7cbcc0,swb4mv,hxmhuu6,"The US had a defensive alliance with Kuwait. When Iraq attacked and occupied Kuwait, the US was obligated to defend them, which drew the US into the conflict. Once the US drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, major hostilities ceased; however, while peace agreements were negotiated, none was ever signed, so the US and Iraq remained at war. 

In the interim, Saddam Hussein decided to eliminate tribes he thought were hostile to his rule. While Saddam’s ruling tribe were Sunni, the vast majority of Iraqi tribes are Shia, which made for significant tensions between the rulers and the ruled. One of the groups Saddam attempted to eliminate was the Marsh Arabs. In order to protect them, the US established no fly zones in the north and south of Iraq in order to keep Saddam from bombing and killing rival Iraqi families. These no fly zones were made a condition of the ceasefire. 

Saddam routinely violated the no fly zones so he could continue killing Marsh Arabs. These violations essentially ended the ceasefire; however, the US continued to refrain from hostilities until the 11 September 2001. 

Rightly or wrongly, the 9/11 attacks convinced the US government that the Middle East had become so volatile as to threaten US security. The Bush admin wrongly believed establishing a democratic government in the Middle East would reduce volatility and since Iraq was considered more westernized than other Middle East states AND we were at war with them (thanks to all of the no fly violations), they decided to depose Saddam and install a democratic government. Unfortunately, they thought they could do it in the cheap and did not adequately plan for the occupation after the quick takeover. Kicking out all members of Saddams Ba’ath party was a significant tactical error. 

Thus, the situation with Russia/Ukraine is not at all, in any way, comparable with US/Iraq. Russia and Ukraine are not at war and Russia has no legal justification for its impending invasion. Hence Russia’s repeated false reports of Ukraine attacks against Russia and Russian assets and allies. It’s an attempt to provide justification for the invasion. 

Like it or not, the US had that justification. Doesn’t mean they should have used it, but they had it. Russia has none. In addition, the US attempted to install a democratic government. Russia intends to install a puppet government favorable to its oligarchy in order to destroy Ukrainian democracy and weaken democratic governments in the region in general.",False,1645305257.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxmc8k2,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

They are really just anti-US but they know it sounds righteous calling it ""anti-imperialism."" When other countries like Russia/Soviet Union engage in imperialism, it is not actually imperialism, they will always find ways to spin it as not. 

They almost always side with those seen as at odds with the US regardless of their economic system, ideology, religious extremism, etc. US bad, so by default, the other side deserves their full support. 

> Imperialism is a policy or ideology of extending rule over peoples and other countries,[2] for extending political and economic access, power and control, often through employing hard power, especially military force, but also soft power[citation needed]. While related to the concepts of colonialism and empire, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government.

At least any man aged 18-65 was ordered to stay and I believe be prepared to take up arms in the event of ""Ukrainian"" aggression.

They were basically conscripted into the army of a Russian backed rebel group and most likely will be sent into conflict with Ukraine to allow Russia to send it's troops in as ""support"".

It's also possible that the women and children being evacuated may be used as another false flag. I saw reports of them not having any heating and being told that they are not allowed to exit the buses. Apparently just now there was an explosive device found in the path of the buses, placed by ""Ukraine"". I'm hoping that's as far as that goes, simply Russia placing an unexploded device there and pointing fingers.

How do you know that they're only looking forward to nights of drinking? Can you personally speak to what they think of their future?

I feel like we're generalizing a lot here.

If I had to guess I'd say none of the stuff besides the 2 facts is true, it's just what Russian leadership would have us believe so we don't realize that this is an entirely selfish pursuit that benefits nobody else on the planet but then.

It's 2022. It's not the 1940s where citizens hear tales of victory and aren't subjected to the ugly sides of war. Russian citizens are likely to see clips of relatives and friends dying. They share a social bond with Ukraine, not in a national sense, but in the sense that even though it's a different country those are still their friends and people they care for.

Like I'm tired of the way American life is heading. I hate that it feels like police brutality, corrupt politicians, and an economy circling the drain are all I have to look forward to. Does that mean I want to see Canadians or Mexicans across the border slaughtered? Of course not. Going to war with them would provide me no peace. It would only make things worse.

Don't try to argue that the ""propaganda machine"" would have them see it differently. I'm not denying that it exists, but Ukraine is filled with people that Russian citizens know. That know people they know. They aren't nameless and faceless populations that Russia will just be able to attribute atrocities to.

They'll tell you they can of course. You'll see comments saying they have complete control and an iron fist on the populations thoughts. They don't.

In both scenarios Iraq had a larger ground force and were on the defense (which is a much larger advantage then people now a days give it credit for). However do to the major gaps in tech it allowed the coalitions to keep Iraq on its heels from the onset. 


Ukraine is much closer to near peer to Russia then Iraq was to the US led coalitions tech wise. The numbers however are not even close. 



Western doctrine generally calls for a 3-1 attacker vs defender to be comfortable for an assault. This changes based on various force multipliers but to simplify it we will just look at tanks, artillery, and air capabilities. Which Russia has a huge advantage in. All that to say that conventionally Ukraine will not win off the rip. 


Unconventionally is a completely different story. Unless Russia goes salting the Earth as they have done in the past they can not hold Ukraine forever. If they go about it that way then the economic situation becomes much much worse for Russia. It would essentially become a race of what breaks first the Ukrainian people's resolve to not be under a Russian thumb or the economy of Russia. We could potentially be looking at a 10+ year very kinetic conflict that would have the same outcome as the Russian-Afghan war. Which would be an economically ruined and politically collapsed Russia along with a war torn Ukraine.

Yanukovych, the Russophilic president whose ouster in Euromaidan triggered the present conflict, won every raion in these two oblasts by 80-90% in the second round of the 2010 election. 

So yes, there’s Russian propaganda at play here, but there’s also clearly a strong sense of Russian identity (as well as a more general Eurasian identity complemented by Soviet nostalgia) and a proclivity towards pro-Russian politics among a majority of the population of this region of Ukraine. This isn’t a defense of Putin or Russian foreign policy, but I don’t think it’s productive to act like the Kremlin conjured everything that’s currently happening in Ukraine out of thin air.

Next you will tell me that NATO is designed to protect peace against Western European countries and not for economically, diplomatically and militarily isolating post-Soviet Russia - the Russia which is ""super, super poor and corrupt"" according to Reddit and which is not a legitimate global threat to Western civilisation/American/German hegemony anymore? 

Please explain how NATO is *not* a sphere of influence and a consolidation of nation-crippling power.

 >By the 18th century, the Russian Empire extended its control to the Pacific, peacefully forming a common border with the Qing Empire and Empire of Japan. This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The Polish–Russian War of 1792 took place after Polish nobility from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth wrote the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The war resulted in eastern Poland being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918.

It's obvious their question is not sincere. They're hoping ignorant lurkers assume based on the wording of the question, the answer must be none and don't actually look it up themselves. It's a common tactic for Russia and their psyops accounts, as well as Leninists/MLs, to make people think only the US engages in imperialism and the actions of countries at odds with the US, like Russia, that meet the definition of imperialism are actually not because reasons. 

> Imperialism is a policy or ideology of extending rule over peoples and other countries,[2] for extending political and economic access, power and control, often through employing hard power, especially military force, but also soft power[citation needed]. While related to the concepts of colonialism and empire, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government.

An actual invasion would put him in a very hard place, why bother when trolling from the border has so many advantages.

It justifies the huge military budget (having more than half of your entire budget exclusively on military needs some justifications especially when there’s no war going on). It focus attention away from domestic policy failures… fearmongering is an actual valid strategy for both, but invasion is a loose-loose proposition. Ukrainian will be screwed again so is EU.

Because as said. Winters still exist and people want to have warm homes. With less coal being used and also a drop out of nuclear energy there is a gap between now and a future with only renewables that gets us through winters with heat via electicity.

Also Nordstream 1 was a project that was very heavily talked about in Germany often also negativly yet it is a ""alternative"" without any transit countries. So the gas that runs through Nordstream 1 would mostly still get to Germany but in other pipelines.

If you do your research a bit deeper you'll find a name ""Gerhard Schröder"" back then he was the Chancellor of Germany and now has a really high position at Gazprom.

Nordstream 2 is also highly controversal and is seen as a bit of political project ot get better connections to Russia as well as economical needed.

Yes it isn't the best explanation and a lot of infos are missing but regarding Nordstream 1 there was a need.

>Yes you are. Why didn't just follow France's example?

Things are not always so simple in Germany. As I said, the nuclear phase-out was an emotional reaction to Fukushima and, in the final analysis, an exit from the phase-out that had been decided years earlier. Nuclear energy has always had a hard time in Germany, partly because of the issue of a final storage site and many reservations. So it is not easy to go the French way, especially since there were and still are many interests in Germany to prefer coal energy to nuclear energy (lobbyism).  
Whether the phase-out was sensible or not is relative, but it is now simply no longer economical for Germany to say that we are building new nuclear power plants, which take decades from planning to commissioning, and which are economically inferior to renewable energies in Germany. Finally, there is the problem of NIMBYs, which would prolong possible construction projects into the beyond.",False,1645288658.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxl961h,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Kinda what I said: Germany imports what it lacks in terms of energy which is absolutely no problem as Germany has plenty of wealth to do so and generally since years an excess of exported goods in others products making importing energy a healhier trading relationship.

It's not about living with or without other countries and that is exactly what trade is for.
Your conclusion is irrelevant because international trade is completly irrelevant to the question whether a country could live without the other. Germany exports other goods in turn to France, both benefit from eachother - economics 101.

Conclusion: Nothing wrong with having largely renewables and importing energy as this leads to a healhier import-export balance since Germany is usually heavier on exports and a strong and wealthy economy.

 >The Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine. From 1986 onward, the total death toll of the disaster has lacked consensus; as peer-reviewed medical journal The Lancet and other sources have noted, it remains contested. There is consensus that a total of approximately 30 people died  from immediate blast trauma and acute radiation syndrome (ARS) in the seconds to months after the disaster, respectively, with 60 in total in the decades since, inclusive of later radiation induced cancer.

Putin knows that thanks to the economic state of the country support for him and his government has been slowly slipping. If he can spin it a war is an excellent way to both win some of that back, and keep people distracted from the countries crippled economy. Of course that doesn't work long term, and so if Putin does make a grab for Ukraine he's probably hoping the Ukraine economy will help bolster his own.

Outside of that it's possible he sees western countries and nato as genuine threat. Especially if Ukraine joins nato. In that case there will be no physical land buffer between Russia and its next most likely adversaries. And so in the event of a major European war, because history has proven it will probably happen at some point, Russia would very much like a layer of a satellite states to take the brunt of the war and bloodshed. This is exactly what the ussr had the soviet block for.

But, Putin also potentially has plenty to gain from *almost* invading but not quite. Piling on the pressure on the Ukraine border puts Russia, and Putin, in the international spotlight. He has the attention of the world, and he is parading Russias military might with intent. This means, if Western leaders are weak they'll try to appease him to prevent a war. This is exactly what happened before wwii with Britain and France trying to appease Hitler as he flexed the German military might and grabbed little bits of land here and there.

 >Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17/MAS17) was a scheduled passenger flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur that was shot down on 17 July 2014 while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbas in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

And it paid off, they are now energy independent and don't have to buy oil from Russia and OPEC.


>Nowadays renewables are cheaper, safer, and faster to roll out. We quintupled our supply to 60% in the last 20 years. It's not a fever dream. It's happening in one of the most industrialized countries on the planet.

Its cheap, yes. At least on small scale. But its unreliable and resource & area ineffective, compared to traditional power plants. If there is no wind or sun the production = 0, which means that it always has to be supplemented by regular powerplants, and instead of chosing something that is actually climate and environmentally friendly, you prefer coal, oil and gas.

The other requirement is also storage (through conversion of energy into hydrogen, batteries, water dams or whatever) which adds another layer of resource and area requirement.


And when you push through renewable energy on a macro scale, this means that it requires a massive amount of resources and area to build, especally to counteract the reliability issues. While nuclear power can have concentrated, reliable, safe and adjustable production that are independent of weather.


And to put it into scale, lets say you have an ideal windturbine (approx 8MW), you would need 125 wind turbines to have the same production as a 1GW nuclear powerplant. And those windturbines are like 200m tall, and has a diameter on the windblades of like 170m. Basically they are fucking massive. And the area they will use will be even bigger, as you need a big distance between them to maintain good airflow.",1645299613.0,1645299188.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxm322n,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

You’re inferring things. You don’t have to work for someone to do things on their behalf. I have no idea why Tucker is doing that, short of the obvious that he does what’s in his best interest- always, no matter the cost to his credibility or morality.

You also admit you don’t know. You haven’t looked into it. Those of us correcting you have. You cannot admit ignorance and then maintain a position of certainty on the thing you plead ignorance to.

So to recap here:

Yes, Tucker Carlson absolutely has been pushing pro-Russian talking points. As someone else has already told you here- he’s gone so far as to suggest we should ally with Russia and help them to invade Ukraine. It’s for sure he benefits from doing so somehow. Could be as simple as ratings. I imagine it’s more nefarious than that, but I won’t speculate further. You’ve admitted you know nothing about that, or any of this.

Russia or nazi germany fills the same role in the scheme. USA built its power on the destruction of Europe, in the end wars in Europe is a strategic profit for them.
What they are trying to do here is persuade the european countries to fulfill there role as a loyal OTAN member. They tried to make Germany the leader or European response, and now after the germans said they had no business entering in direct conflict they turn to France. And sadly they might have more success using the french guilt feeling (that they helped growing themselves in the Iraq campaigns) to make them fight to regain ""honnor"".

But really if the US do not want to let Russia invade Ukraine, it is because they know it will be Russia challenging their world lead. So whatever the European response, USA will engage if there is an invasion. They will not let Russia do it. Now the question is do they have to do it alone or can they use Europe.

My point is not to say ""US are villains"" or ""Russians are villains"" or whatever. As you say it, when it comes to the strategic interest of a nation, one plays with the cards he gets.
Strategy and morale are two things to separate. For example, when USA makes the marshall plan to rebuild Europe, did Europe profit of it? Surely it did, and would be in a terrible state without it. Was it a sheer act of selfless kindness? Well not really, because US ensured themselves the loyalty of western Europe while not having their domination challenged.

Now today Putin is trying to invade a country. Is Putin a ruthless dictator no one should ever trust? Surely he is. Is US protecting Ukraine only because Putin is a very bad man? Well not realy, because if they do not act it would mean their authority can be contested, and no one has any reason to listen to them as world leaders any more.

And in this situation, in the case of European countries, they have zero benefits in engaging with Russia, because no matter their position, US will never in a million years let Putin invade Ukraine.

Notice how the polls start in 1990? That is because martial law was lifted in 1988, and prior to that supporting even the idea of ""Taiwanese"" independence or identity would have got you arrested or even killed. You were forced to identify as Chinese by the authoritarian dictatorship...

Prior to martial law, such concepts were heavily discussed during the Taiwanese nativist literature movement from the 1920's. The 1946 novel [Orphan of Asia by Wu Chuo-liu](https://toolkit.culture.tw/en/literatureinfo_79_170.html) is one of many perfect examples of this: 

>""The Orphan of Asia examines the issue of colonial identity – a controversial theme that challenged Wu’s readers to ask themselves: Am I Chinese, Japanese, or Taiwanese?

>“That was recognised with the work that the Reagan administration did to lay out the policies that the United States has adhered to now for three-and-a-half decades,” he said.

The United States does not have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, but they recognize the government in Taipei as the governing authorities over Taiwan through binding de jure public law. Taiwan Relations Act defines Taiwan as:

>“Taiwan” includes, as the context may require, the islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores, the people on those islands, corporations and other entities and associations created or organized under the laws applied on those islands, and **the governing authorities on Taiwan recognized by the United States as the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979, and any successor governing authorities** (including political subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities thereof).""",False,1645322549.0,t3_swb4mv,t1_hxlqp5w,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Lol yes it definitely isn’t that costly to move almost 200k people to the border /s
Just the movements that they have done so far alone have already cost billions usd. Let alone what the actual war will cost. War is expensive. The war in Iraq cost the US 2 trillion dollars, the equivalent of 133% of Russia’s current gdp. The war in Afghanistan was the equivalent of 400% or 4 times Russia’s GDP over a spread of 20 years. This is equal to 20% of all Russia’s income for 2 decades. It will likely cost more than this for Russia to invade considering the Ukrainians are very well armed and organized. Russia already struggles with intense poverty and this will not help and may be the final nail in the coffin for their crumbling government. Ukraine is a much more powerful military than Iraq or Afghanistan had and has 4 million more people than Iraq had. They also have financial and equipment backing from nato. This war will not “pay for itself”. It will literally cost Russia trillions and they may not even win anything. Russia has not and will not ever profit enough from gas to pay for this. Also, did you not hear of the intense sanctions being threatened against them? These have strong effects and cannot be ignored. Just some extra billions that Russia will lose. That will negate any extra income off of gas by itself. You’re delusional if you believe Russia’s struggling economy can handle a war larger than the U.S’s invasion of both Iraq and Afghanistan. In terms of invasion difficulty (not even getting into the cost of occupying) this will be closer to Russia’s Vietnam.

The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to support Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah's last name was Al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيرة الصباح) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States.

In the lead-up to the invasion, the United States and the United Kingdom claimed that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction and that he thus presented a threat to his neighbors and to the world community. The US stated, ""on November 8, 2002; the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1441. All 15 members of the Security Council agreed to give Iraq a final opportunity to comply with its obligations and disarm or face the serious consequences of failing to disarm. The resolution strengthened the mandate of the UN Monitoring and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), giving them the authority to go anywhere, at any time, and talk to anyone in order to verify Iraq's disarmament.""[3] Throughout late 2001, 2002, and early 2003, the Bush administration worked to build a case for invading Iraq, culminating in then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's February 2003 address to the Security Council.[4] Shortly after the invasion, the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, and other intelligence agencies largely discredited evidence related to Iraqi weapons as well as alleged links to al-Qaeda, and at this point, the Bush and Blair administrations began to shift to secondary rationales for the war, such as the Saddam Hussein government's human rights record and promoting democracy in Iraq.[5][6] Opinion polls showed that people of nearly all countries opposed a war without a UN mandate and that the perception of the United States as a danger to world peace had significantly increased.[7][8] UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the war as illegal, saying in a September 2004 interview that it was ""not in conformity with the Security Council"".[9]

Accusations of faulty evidence and alleged shifting rationales became the focal point for critics of the war, who charge that the Bush administration purposely fabricated evidence to justify an invasion that it had long planned to launch.[10] The US led the effort for ""the redirection of former Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) scientists, technicians, and engineers to civilian employment and discourage emigration of this community from Iraq"".[11]

You see that in the western hemisphere, the survival of a government is absolutely contingent upon following US guidelines or said government will be replaced by a government handpicked by the US. After acknowledging this, you say that these governments are not puppets nor are they ruled. They're certainly not independent.

This directly implies that Putin’s atrocities are on the same level as Hitler’s. I adamantly reject that comparison. Each is guilty of invading neighboring territories, but this is not what makes Hitler the monster we remember him as, so the comparison is far from apt.

>	hitler isn’t just holocaust man. that guy literally never mentioned the holocaust, and was just randomly called a holocaust denier because he mentioned hitler invading his neighbors without saying the token “Hitler did holocaust” you seem to expect from everyone who discusses the man.

This is exactly what downplays the genuine atrocity of the Holocaust. You cannot casually say someone will “go down in the history books with the likes of Hitler” because of a similarity unrelated to why we remember Hitler as we do. Hitler was not the horrendous villain he was because he disputed territory. This alone would not have been historically anomalous enough to warrant the disgust we have for him. He is remembered as the monster he was for one singular reason: the Holocaust. To say or imply otherwise is a denial of the true atrocity that the Holocaust was.
