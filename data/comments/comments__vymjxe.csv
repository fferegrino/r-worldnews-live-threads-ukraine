Day 141 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a relatively quiet day, there was no shelling and they only did a single missile strike. They change their missile launch time almost every day now, this time it was at 2:30am. In total 4 missiles were fired, 2 of them struck the same place, one apparently blew up in the air for whatever reason, and the last missile was most likely intercepted, or at least that is what some people reported.

Yesterday’s missile strike was aimed at a subway train depot, because it looks like they are not just scared of schools, but also of the public transport. This is not the first time they are hitting one of our subway train depots, and I really don’t understand why, it just seems so pointless.

That missile strike in the middle of Vinnytsia was horrific. This is yet another attempt to terrorize regular people. I wonder how long it will take them to understand that it won’t ever work. Maybe they will never understand it, especially seeing how regular Russians cheer on those missile strikes; they celebrate every civilian death, seeing it as “another Nazi dead.” It’s absolutely vile; some of them were saying that it is revenge for destroying their ammo dump in Nova Kakhovka, because apparently killing civilians is a worthy retaliation for destroying their military target? 

This could have gone way worse than it already did, because later in the day there was supposed to be a charity concert in the Officers’ House, which by the way, doesn’t actually have anything to do with military, it’s a public concert hall. Why the fuck would we have our high command sitting in a building literally called “Officers’ House”? Did they even think what they were targeting before firing?",False,1657852315.0,t3_vymjxe,t3_vymjxe,,0,61,0,61,1,0,

""A new report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe documents the discovery of torture chambers at a summer camp in Bucha, Ukraine.  
  
This report — OSCE's second one — covered the period between April 1 to June 25. The OSCE experts traveled to Ukraine to collect evidence, including visiting the towns of Bucha and Irpin, which the report said were “two emblematic examples of the breaches of International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, which constitute war crimes.”  
  
The experts noted that photographic and video evidence showed Russian forces carried out “targeted, organized killings of civilians in Bucha” who were found shot dead with their hands tied behind their backs.  
  
The report documented a “series of torture chambers separated by concrete walls” discovered at a summer camp in Bucha, including a room that the report said appeared to be used for executions with bullet holes in the walls.  
  
In another room where experts said there was evidence of torture and waterboarding, five dead men were found. “They were covered with burns, bruises, and lacerations,” the report said.  
  
In a village in the Bucha district, the bodies of 18 men, women and children were discovered in a basement.  
  
The report said that “some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out.”  
The OSCE mission wrote that reports of women and girls being raped and sexually abused by Russian forces “have become abundant,” especially in territories newly occupied by Russian forces.  
  
The report noted several particularly atrocious cases, including a report from the Ukrainian Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmyla Denisova, who said that 25 girls aged 14 to 24 years old were kept in a basement in Bucha and gang-raped. Nine became pregnant, the report said.  
  
The report also documented instances of Ukrainian civilians being used as “human shields,” being forced to fight alongside Russians against their own country in the ongoing war and being displaced to Russia without their consent.   
  
The report noted: “Russian soldiers used over 300 Ukrainian civilians as human shields and held them captive for 25 days in March in the basement of Yahidne School, where a major Russian military camp was located.”",False,1657842676.0,t3_vymjxe,t3_vymjxe,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

👉 On Wednesday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  That doesn't mean nothing's happening, and here's a nice [recap of the action](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547384107851825153.html) if you want to head into the weeds.

🍄 Ukraine continues attacking russia's logistics.  Nova Kakhovka was hit again on the 13^th, not as spectacularly as on the 12^th though the [trolls tried to make it so](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547308858422579202.html). The following ammo dumps were also HIMARed on the 13^th:  

* 🍄 Chaplinka (district), Kherson Oblast
* 🍄 Chornobayivka, Kherson Oblast
* 🍄 Horlivka, Donetsk Oblast
* 🍄 Luhansk
* 🍄 Makiiivka, Donetsk Oblast

👉 In addition to HIMARS, Ukrainian partisan attacks continue with the mayor of a small town in the russian controlled east [assassinated](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1547311499886067713).  Additionally, the russian installed governor of the Kherson area was poisoned and [hospitalized in critical condition](https://twitter.com/alexpez05298224/status/1547222785956667392) -- this was the third attempt on his life.

💰 Lithuania is set to [allow russia to ship sanctioned goods](https://twitter.com/Insider_FX/status/1547321502302871552) to its exclave Kaliningrad.  Although Europe also caved to russia on the Canadian Gas Turbine, the russian oil company Gazprom today said that it [still can't receive the turbine](https://twitter.com/WarInUkraineYet/status/1547261482282487808) which lead many to believe russia is going to use the turbine as an excuse to keep the gas turned off, punishing Europe for its support of Ukraine.

👉 Ukraine has [nothing to discuss](https://twitter.com/RobertPaul1/status/1547286017526431744) with russia in regards to peace talks, reiterating that there will be war so long as russia occupies Ukrainian soil.

👉 While peace talks may be off, Ukraine, UN, Turkey, and russia held talks on establishing grain corridors and are making [some progress](https://twitter.com/Mariia_Zolkina/status/1547309311273177090) .  Although the recently opened [Danube](https://twitter.com/theusarticles/status/1547137907584077824) trade corridor will help Ukraine to ship more grain, it needs the port in Odessa to really get back to near pre-war levels of shipments.

👉 russia has stolen [$613 million](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1547320211015172097) in Ukrainian crops and oils.  No doubt it would steal more, but russia [stole the harvesters](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1547280319400787968) necessary to harvest the crops in occupied territories.  russia continues to [target](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1547288408934027270) Ukrainian [farms](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1547214809170690048) so it can use its own grain reserves as [political capital](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1547233562746929152).

👉 Iran [denied](https://twitter.com/rogue_corq/status/1547213026226425856) it's going to supply drones to russia.  Meanwhile, the Ukrainians, already world-renowned hackers, are modifying their drones to [help them win on the battlefield](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547331386536755200.html)

👉 The US [highlighted](https://twitter.com/WesselBaden/status/1547262044461621253) russia's forced deportation of nearly [2 million](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1547291860858798081.html) Ukrainians to the farthest flung places in russia.

👉 The US and Ukraine [are in talks](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1547301184913932289) that may eventually allow Ukraine to procure 300km long-range HIMARS missiles that would give russia no refuge anywhere within Ukraine's lawful borders.

>	Battlefield update:
Kharkiv: 🇷🇺 attempting to move west from Kozacha Lopan on Svitlichne. Attempt at Dementiivka got repelled.

>	Marinka, Vuhledar: tactical movements
Zaporozhye: tactical actions
Kherson: 🇺🇦 mercilessly bombing rear, warehouses, destroying personnel and ammo.

>	M142 HIMARS:

>	Last 24 hours destroyed warehouses in Donetsk (2x), Nova Khakovka (again), Kirovsky District, Kherson district and more. Air defense missile supplies hit in Luhansk area, when damaged those missiles can fly somewhere 1-3km.

>	A battalion or brigade stationed nearby reportedly also damaged in secondary explosions.
Last week over 50 hits, all successful. Intercepted calls and other communications are near panic – huge losses, and no idea what to do.
It is game-changing weapon.

>	Since 2008, 🇷🇺 has spent billions $ to improve their army, yet 10 vehicles can change everything. It should never happen to any military, it shows how much corruption is happening to build fake army.
Discussions for obtaining 300km ATACMS missiles.

>	More reports on destroyed 🇷🇺 ammo depots: Luhansk, Chornobaivka, Makiivka, Chaplinka, Horlivka.

>	🇷🇺 Losses:

>	From July 1st-10th, in Luhansk and Donetsk hospitals (only 2 directions out of 6) received 543 wounded solders, from those 187 🇷🇺 regular forces, 332 from 1st/2nd corps, 24 non-identified, possibly Wagner. Not accounted Rosguardia, Border guards, FSB and missing/not evacuated.

>	Real losses are estimated doubled – 1000 in 10 days.
Izium-Bakhmut have approx 40-50 non-full BTGs, estimating about 20-25k solders, taking losses 1k every 10 days. Units losing battle capabilities in about month.

>	Estimated over 50k solders and other 🇷🇺 personnel killed, additional 22k from LNR/DNR killed. Total losses approaching 100k. What for?

>	Poll – 🇷🇺 citizens don’t want to finance 🇷🇺 army [link]:
63.4% won’t help, 8.4% would help with 10% of their income.

>	55% called victory senseless.
45% feeling increased anxiety, depression and bad mood.
Poll shows, that mobilization can’t be done, can’t even escalate.

>	🇷🇺 emergency meeting:
Emergency meeting to be held on 15th of July.

>	Anything that 🇷🇺 can do now, will be 30 times weaker than in 24th February. Meanwhile 🇺🇦 is 100 times better prepared, better weapons. Most likely firing some officials, social-economical changes, asking citizens to tighten belts, possibly blaming and/or firing government.

>	🇷🇺 has understood, it has lost, possibly now taking measures of after war. Some officials might think, that they can hold onto Luhansk and Donetsk districts, use them as leverage in negotiations. It’s largest wave since April, when 🇷🇺 trying to negotiate.

. . . 

>	🇷🇺 army had advantage in artillery and armored vehicles. Artillery advantage is now solved, 🇺🇦 needs more armored vehicles. When 🇺🇦 has enough armored vehicles, it will be ready for offensive. Until then 🇺🇦 is wearing out 🇷🇺 on built up defense.

>	🇷🇺 started to dig trenches near Antonovskiy Bridge in Kherson. It looks like Kherson is already lost in 🇷🇺 minds.

>	🇧🇾 Belarus:
Again rumors on possible plan to kill Lukashenka, and replace with someone controlled by Putin.

>	Highly unlikely, as 🇧🇾 would not be able to attack then due to internal politics and riots. Problems would start, if 🇷🇺 army would enter 🇧🇾, but 🇷🇺 doesn’t have enough army. In mobilization drill, 90% refused to arrive in war commissariat.

Earlier U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Tehran was planning to supply military drones to Russia. However, the Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Hossein Amir-Abdollahian denied Sullivans’ claim, La Repubblica reported on July 13.

Iran avoids any actions that could lead to further escalation in Ukraine, including the supply of military equipment, Amir-Abdollahian said.

“We have defense agreements with Russia, but we will not help any of the parties involved in this conflict,” he added.

Another good news came from the eastern direction . Attack aircraft from the 80th brigade, having organized a clear tactical interaction with other units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard, destroyed a tank company of Russians in a day.

This was reported by the  press service of the brigade on Facebook.
According to information, the day before, on July 13, the enemy launched a massive attack on Ukrainian positions. However, our defenders were ready for this and prepared a ""hot reception"" for the invaders.

As a result, clear tactical interactions led to losses:

- 9 Russian tanks (almost a tank company)

- 7 units of other armored vehicles (armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles) 
- about 70 invaders

The brigade emphasized that they smashed the enemy equipment and infantry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine competently and harmoniously. 

Reconnaissance noticed and fixed targets, and then they were disposed of by artillery and assault groups with the help of Stugna, Javelins, NLAW ATGMs and RPG-7, AT-4 grenade launchers.

The destruction of so many invaders' vehicles in just one day is, of course, not the final victory of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but a significant step towards its approach, our defenders added.",False,1657826593.0,t3_vymjxe,t3_vymjxe,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

*Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Nasser Kanaani has responded to a question by journalists regarding the US national security advisor's remarks about Iran's sale of homegrown new technologies to Russia.*  
  
*Kanaani said cooperation between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation dates back to before the onset of the Ukraine war and no specific development came about recently in this regard.*  
  
*He added that the Islamic Republic of Iran's stance on the Ukraine war is absolutely clear and has been declared time and again officially.*  
  
*Kanaani said the US official makes such claims at a time when Washington and European governments have turned occupying and invading countries including in West Asia into an arsenal of their diverse lethal arms.*  
  
*He added undoubtedly without those arms, the Zionists would not have been able to continue their crimes, aggression and occupation of Palestine for more than seven decades.*

""No specific development"" could very easily mean they are still sending the drones since they in no way 100% denied sending anything.

It has to do with the fact that the social construct called ""Russia"" starting from the time of Mongolian rule was built on domination and sadism meaning the whole Russian population is used to their ""state"" not only not caring about them but actively needing to subjugate them and being a predatory presence in their life. 

Because of this there is a red thread of sadism that runs through the whole states operation and much of the population coupled with a quite strongly warped sense of what constitutes a truth vs a lie. 

This is the reason the Russian army is built around hazing and more akin to an organized crime outfit as is the judiciary and most other state institutions. 

The Russian concept of truth and lie is a hilarious thing to learn about as one of their concepts of truth in reality is what in the west would be considered a shared lie. 

When the Russian state actively targets civilians with these terror bombing campaigns while publicly stating they are not the point of doing so is to demonstrate sadistic power and they force the Russian people to share in the obvious lie that they aren't doing it thus making them have some ownership of the murderous act.

The Russian culture truly has some vile aspects to it.

The biggest foe Ukraine faces right now is potential for he loss of western resolve and support. Two months may be on the optimistic side.

The ruzzian war machine isn't on the mat yet and it might futher mobilize, yes those troops will be suspect, but I believe a lot of the ruzzian loses to date are DPR/LPR conscripts.

As long a Western nations are united in support of a full defeat of putin, Ukraine will prevail. Once again I think two months is a bit optimistic.

🌻 Call your government and demand more sanctions on rusia. Reach to your governors social media and publicly ask them what have they done to help stop rusia, what is their next move and when there will be more weapons. Demand more help to Ukraine.

\-isn't campaigning for reelection

\-benefits politically from cutting off Russian interference

\-has justification to return the favor of 2016

\-has already publicly tried to stop this war from starting, giving Putin tons of leverage to fall back

\-has already publicly slow-walked everything

\-knows that Putin fears a manufactured color revolution (despite that Ukraine did theirs themselves...the US could learn from Ukraine on that one in some ways)

\-isn't going to be in office much longer (2024 is questionable)

\-isn't going to *live* much longer, and already lost a son tragically; he also lost most of his family tragically once in the 70s, which has colored many of his positions/opinions

\-has the untapped benefit of a youth base that is violently nihilistic and angry as hell.  Blaming Russia and Republicans would solve a ***lot*** of political problems

\-**will not** go below 35% approval and a solid voter turnout because the alternative is so toxic the US may as well not exist at all to his own party's constituents (some of them see ""nukes over the ice caps"" as *preferable* to Desantis), and *literally nothing can stop that*

The entire global economy depends on OPEC's oil output. PERIOD. End of story. This was obvious to me in 1972.

And it's been true every single time there's either a real disruption, or even suspected or threatened disruption (as happened in 2006 due to the Iraq war), inflation is driven up (due to increased transportation costs of goods).  

Trying to fix inflation by raising interest rates: sure, it works. But you also end up forcing hundreds of thousands or millions of workers to have their lives and incomes disrupted by layoffs. It's equivalent to sabotaging your own labor force.

People don't want to admit that a lot of evil things happen in the world, because we allow major oil producers to dictate policy via blackmail. 

Climate change is bad, of course.

When you speak of the Russian people ""sharing in the obvious lie"" (that Russia is not actively targeting civilians with terror bombing campaigns), I guess you are assuming what Martti refers to as круговая порука (translated as ""gang guarantee"" in the subtitles)?

A friend of mine is married to an elder Russian lady, who very much bought into the whole Russian propaganda at the outset of this war.  Her views have since softened, but this has led to her being cast out by her (Russian) friends and family, which has caused considerable upset.  Had this been a ""shared lie"", which everyone always understood to be false but nonetheless parroted for the advancement of the group's goals (Martti's explanation of круговая порука), surely personal relationships would not have been so disrupted?

""And now, when 90 percent of the plant is completed, **Kaliningrad has replaced, without retendering, the contractor with a local company**, which will take responsibility for the whole plant,"" NDEP manager Jaakko Henttonen said last month, speaking from Kaliningrad. ""It's like a bad joke.""  
Tsukanov, who has been governor since September 2010, did not respond to a request for comment.

They also gave the Excalibur which is also GPS precision guided at 68km with sub 3m precision and BONUS which is the same on top of SPGs which don't really need the GPS guided rounds for extreme precision.

On top of that UA does not need these to hit field targets but critical infrastructure and assets. UA has more than enough cheap area off effect MLRS which uses dumb munitions that they actually produce them selves.

No no UA wont have a M30/M31 shortage anytime soon. And they are not just spraying these around looking at videos they use 1-3 rounds for fairly large warehouses since ammo and fuel ignition cascades and brings down the rest.

Also US can produce some 10,000 M30/M31 and there are large stocks elsewhere as well. ATACMS is also not really in very limited amount.

I don't think ATACMS is really useful for UA until they actually get rid of a larger portion of Russian AA. M30/M31 are fast, low approach, small and hard to detect. ATACMS is a fat and slow missile, not that it is bad mind you just that there is not that many targets for it and its easier to intercept.

M30/M31 allow UA to strike up to 120km into Russian territory. Having your ammo dumps fragmented creates a logistical nightmare having it 50km+ behind the line is already a nightmare, having it 100km+ your frontline will start to collapse soon and you wont really be making any advances.

We already see the effect of HIMARS strikes. Russian conventional and rocket artillery are down and their operations have become very limited.

However, the control only works up to the end of the radar horizon of the FCR, which is quite limited on land, even if the radar is elevated. This means that the missile may not receive any control data from a few hundred meters above the ground and is then flying blind. This is probably the reason for the relatively low precision. The large missiles, however, have a 140kg HE warhead and the effective range should be quite decent if it triggers a few meters above ground.

He's very well read, and in fact, I can't even really approach this discussion with him, because at that level, he always quotes some obscure material by Tolstoy or whatever and I have no idea what he's talking about.  

And at the end of the day, I'm just not as invested in this stuff to spend the kind of time to do that much reading.  

And it's completely orthogonal to the point that, the propaganda that Ukrainians are NAZIs or the ""Odessa Massacre"" happened, and justifies Russias ""peacekeeping"" is justified - - is utterly false, and baseless made up garbage, not based in fact.

So he's so emotionally-invested in his ""Communism solves all of humanity's problems so Russian tactics are all justified"" worldview, and IDENTITY, that really no debate is possible. In his mind, anyone who hasn't read the foundational Marxism stuff is just an ""evil liberal"", and Nazi-adjacent.  And i guess you're right - it's kind of 'black-and-white' thinking.

Almost 2 in 5 italians (39%) believe our media has a strong pro-Ukrainian bias and that we don't receive a complete and transparent information.

I suppose at least people who are basically financially broken won't need to care about money, as at least for Germany the state will provide them with accommodation. Although the accommodation might not be so good.

Also the language barrier seems to be quite hard. Even many young people don't seem to speak English.

Also of course if you know that your city probably might be taken next week by Russian soldiers it seems obvious to leave, while you might be more inclined to stay in relatively less unsafe places.

Also one needs to have high resilience to handle the mental load. It's hard even for people who aren't affiliated with Ukrainians, so I can't images how hard it might be for Ukrainians.

There is a possibility to install GPS based guidance package. I read about some tests of S-300 system where their SARH homing was used in connection with GPS for anti-radar duties. Basically you could enter the position, program the frequency pattern  launch the missile and it was flying to the position and if the radar was active - it was homing on it's signal. If not - it was striking the coordinates. I don't know if it could continue on the homing path if the radar was turned off in the terminal phase (like HARM can).

We also have reached an interesting age for infantry AT. ATGMs like the Javelin and NLAW are *man-portable*, but that doesn't mean they're comfortable to carry or suitable for long foot patrol work, both are pretty heavy systems. Lightweight AT does exist - the AT4, the M72 LAW, the RPG-7, but none are particularly useful against modern armour.

So, infantry has a tough choice - schlep old AT around that's light enough to carry, perfectly viable against BTRs and the like, but might be dead weight when faced with a T-80 or something else newer, have a constant vehicle companion with heavier AT to be unloaded, or forego AT entirely and rely on cover, low profile, and high mobility.

Currently the greatest advantage Ukraine has is morale: they are fighting for their lives and homes and Russians don't know what they're fighting for. Don't boost Russian morale if you don't need to. The other advantage is global support; Ukraine has been tailoring their messaging to a world audience to convince slow-moving and recalcitrant governments to send arms and aid. Blowing up any civilian infrastructure is contrary to that messaging, but especially when it's cutting off the opponent's retreat: If you want the invader to leave the country, don't blow up their exit ramp. 

Now if at any point that bridge became a key pipeline of Russian weapons and logistics, I could see the need to blow it up. But currently that is not the case, as Russia shares a huge land border. If the south and the east fronts become disconnected, the need may arise to blow up the bridge.

All of that combined leaves Russia with a system that is pretty diverse on paper and allows for its subjects (the subjects of the federation at large) to have a lot of autonomy in a lot of questions and ways, but the reality is, Putin has stripped away nearly all of it by installing obeying puppets everywhere he could, and when he couldn't, he went his good ol' repressionism, political harassment and calling people ""foreign agents"". One great example is [Sergei Furgal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Furgal) who wasn't backed by the regime in any way, but still won thanks to people's support and Alexei Navalny's Smart Voting initiative that aimed to guide people through voting possible Putin puppets out of the offices in various regions of the country. The initiative was great, really, because it was shaking the regime across the country with all the non-Putin's politicians taking seats and then making their own decisions, for the good of their... whatever their responsibility was, like region or something smaller/bigger, sorry, too many details here haha.

So point is, now that Navalny is in jail and repressions are it its highest (as it seems), Putin managed once again establish an overly-centralized system where he is the only puppeteer (can't call the fuck the master of puppets as that's one cool hell of a name for such a miserable little prick) - the vast majority of the money that various subjects of the federation manage to make go to Moscow (some go to St. Petersburg, too) and nobody is making decisions that you would expect from an adequately operating federation.

Hope that clears something out! In my opinion, not long after Putin's demise and provided that Russia stays as one country (or at least doesn't break up into MANY smaller sovereign ones), we will definitely see a huge rise of the local authorities, all within the existing laws and, most importantly, the constitution. The latter is actually great - it if was followed and obeyed, Russia would be quite wonderful of a place to live with all the rights and freedoms its constitution guarantees.",False,1657800856.0,t3_vymjxe,t1_ig3t7xd,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

They got a scout report that a ""column"" of tanks was heading towards their position and that allied tanks and air support were not available. So they carried all the AT gear up a ridge to set up an ambush for the ""column"".

The column turned out to be a lone T-55. He then commented that him, and apparently every other soldier, realized that if they fired their weapon, they wouldn't have to haul it back down the ridge.

homie, these rocket batteries are already built.

These are designed according to tight specs. They either work well, or they don't.

Couldn't they sell some gas now without cancelling long term contracts?

Or if they make fertiliser, then fertiliser prices should be lower than otherwise. That also helps, maybe by replacing some other production and freeing fuel there.
