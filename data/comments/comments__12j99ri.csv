I have only read transcripts and summaries, I watched enough of this type of content during the ISIS era. Thank you to those that did, while words can't describe how disgusting it is, you bear witness for us all. This is important, so try and take some solace in that.

If you are struggling with having seen that content, I found distraction and focus on other things helpful last time round (I watched far too many ISIS vids). If you can't escape it, seek help ASAP or it will eat your brain and invade your dreams.

On the subject of the video - this is completely abhorrent and should serve as a reminder for what Ukraine fights for. It is not just democracy, Europe or international norms, it's basic human values.

To do this is so disgusting it should make us feel sick, to do it, record it and then release it... ... That is even worse. That means they're proud of it and wish to instill fear in enemies and make the behaviour ok for their peers... Potentially even encourage more such heinous acts.

We need to remember this, and we need to strengthen our resolve. We need to put our representatives on notice, more aid for Ukraine and now. This is a war of ***survival***, survival from torture, persecution and medieval barbarity. Survival of basic human values, for life.

Tank crews drive towards the frontline in Bakhmut from Chasiv Yar, the nearest town to its west.

Few buildings remain intact and those queuing for food and other aid do not even flinch at the sound of artillery. 

Should Russia gain Bakhmut, Chasiv Yar contains Ukraine's defensive lines to stop enemy soldiers advancing to two bigger cities in the Donetsk region - Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.

Twice as many Russian soldiers have been killed in action than Ukrainian ones, supposed US intelligence leaks show.

If authentic, 354,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured so far.

The documents cite the US Defence Intelligence Agency as estimating the number of casualties are around 10 times bigger than any public figures published by either Moscow or Kyiv.

Russian wounded: 154,000 to 180,000

Russian deaths: 35,500 to 43,000

Ukrainian wounded: 109,000 to 113,500

Ukrainian deaths: 15,500 to 17,500

They also show that while Russia has numerical superiority in some areas, Ukraine has almost double the number of tanks and 500 more armoured personnel carriers (APCs) on the battlefield.

The number of those lost in theatre were estimated to be:

Russian tank losses: 2,048

Russian APC losses: 3,900

Ukrainian tank losses: 468

Ukrainian APC losses: 1,020

As we have written previously, Sky News cannot independently verify the documents and their veracity has  been questioned by some countries.

Since we know this is a higher than normal number, we can extrapolate a maximum. The hotline has been active since September (though there were unofficial channels before this), and so it's been active for 7 months.

Simple estimation would be 7x3k = 21k surrendered. I'd guesstimate the lows would be around half, and peaks during the mobilization periods (Russia has been shadow mobilizing in the last few months), so I'd take that total number down to around 16-17k.

A more interesting statistic would be the rate of surrender. Considering that in the last few months we've seen daily casualties  in the 600+ range, it seems that surrender is not an attractive option for most Russian soldiers, despite the option being easily accessible. As such, I'd advise handing a big can of STFU to anyone crying about the fates of the poor mobiks, forced into the war. They have a way out of it, yet they choose not to take it.  


edit: Looks like there are some official numbers - 6500 from September to end of January, so including the 3k from March, we're likely around 10-11k total

With some wars some people enlisted as they didn't realise it was going to be a long difficult war. Now doesn't that sound familiar? How long was Putin's easy ""special operation"" going to take? 3 days wasn't it?  

Not all heroes are soldiers either. Just think of all those truly selfless medics, doctors, nurses, all the people keeping supplies moving back and too, the spies, those who processed information, manufactured munitions, kept the troops morale up, etc. Don't forget that during some wars there were reserved occupations, such as farmers. Here in the UK farming was vital during the war, especially with rationing.  

Years ago I knew an old Polish man. Only once did he speak of his youth. He was a young man working on his parents farm when the Nazis invaded Poland. He was given a choice, fight with the Nazis or watch his parents be shot right there and then.  

Given that choice he did what he thought would save their lives and fought for the Nazis. At the first opportunity he surrendered to the allies and became a PoW.  

After the war he was released in the UK where he spent the rest of his life working on farms until his poor health forced him to retire. As far as I know he didn't know what really happened to his parents. I wondered if he was afraid to find out.  

Deep down he wasn't really a fighter either. All he wanted to do was to paint along with Bob Ross. He was a gentle man. So much so that he would even gently pet bees by ever so slightly stroking the hairs on their backs.  

That was the only time he spoke of his youth and the war.  

I've known others who have seen active duty.  

My dad told me about terrorists giving bombs with badly made timers to young kids to deliver to the army camp. Most of the time the bombs went off early while the children were still holding them.

There are war crimes happening at the behest, direction, or benefit of leaders. The tortured and murdered captees at Irpen, Kherson and Izyum are examples of this.

The beheading is caused by different problems. Mainly, the problem is that this is a 2,000-kilometer-long front with hundreds of thousands of soldiers without good officer leadership. It is almost inevitable that such a large force will have many sadistic psychopaths inside of it, particularly when so many of the troops are literal convicted murderers and rapists.

When you unleash so many people upon a countryside and don't have enough officers (of any quality) to watch over them, and when a war devolves into completely animalistic struggles for survival, then this is what happens. Many of these soldiers no longer even give a fuck about their lives -- they actively assume that they are going to die within a week or a month or so. They lose friends over and over and over again, to the point where they are numb and view relationships as fleeting concepts. They view human life itself as pointless because it's all been shocked out of their heads. And if they joined the war effort already being someone inside who enjoys inflicting misery on other human beings, then this descent happens even faster.

The soldiers in this film are so far-gone, logic-wise, that they lack even the self-preservatory instinct to not film this, and to not upload it. This happens a lot with war crimes. The war criminals get so caught up in the act of catharsis -- torturing and mutilating an ""enemy"" -- that they don't even snap out of the bloodlust *after* it's complete and stop to wonder if it's maybe not the best idea to broadcast their sins for the entire world to see. They don't think about it because they don't care -- they actively assume they'll be killed in battle before they face any accountability.",1681305922.0,1681305590.0,t3_12j99ri,t1_jfyflw5,,3,19,0,19,0,0,

That MAY change but I think people over-estimate DeSantis' willingness to run for president. He can be a lot more fascist in a small controlled ecosystem like Florida than being president which in some ways has relatively limited powers. He also does not seem to talk about foreign affairs much from what I've seen he just wants to turn his state into a hell hole.

Though I also think Trump will lose if he runs again barring something major happening. Trump has committed the one grave sin in the eyes of the average Republican voter: he lost. He's a loser. Either he lost to Biden in an election fair and square, or Biden and his crew out-maneuvered his and successfully stole the election in the game of political fuckery Republicans so clearly think is okay to engage in. (at least when they are the ones doing it.) THEN he failed a coup attempt that was hilariously weak. Nowadays he doesn't draw much of a crowd. He whines. He can't tweet (currently), nobody really cares about his little social media posts. Every time he's in the headlines it's about another way he's losing. And he's STILL the best the Republicans have lol. Remember that 30 point lead is not over Biden, it is among Republicans over the other candidates. 

Also while I do believe Republicans are just brains-not-connected-to-body stupid, an unexciting third Trump election will hopefully leave enough of them at home that Democrats and maybe some independeints pick up other seats in the other races as well in that same election.

This is objectively false. Russia literally yesterday passed laws to catch draft dodgers because they need more meat. Ukraine is pulling reasonable kill ratio's around Bakhmut. 

Russia is rolling out such material as T-55, its T-90s have T-72 gear inside. Russia is not doing as well as the propaganda wants you to believe. 

its officer core was already weak by European standards and they have been wiped out multiple times. Thankfully Russian command is so entrenched that no capable commanders can bubble to the top either.

What if I voted for Donald Trump in both primaries and general elections?  Or for some fictional candidate who's only platform plank was entrenching and supporting the electoral college?  Would it make me responsible for the electoral college?  Would it make the system democratic somehow?  Would it mean that I was somehow unworthy to report on the state of things because I didn't struggle in vain every moment of my life to change that state at the expense of all other concerns?

I choose not to play your game.  I do not need to prove myself to you or anyone else.
