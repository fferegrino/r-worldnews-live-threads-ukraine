For newcomers, this is an amateur's take on the ISW daily bullet points. I know nothing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>Ukrainian forces made tactically significant gains in and east of Robotyne in western Zaporizhia Oblast on August 20-21 while continuing counteroffensive operations on the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast administrative border and in eastern Ukraine.

Quite frankly it's remarkable Ukraine can advance on multiple fronts simultaneously. A true testament to their resolve (and Russian weakness). 

The most important news comes from Robotyne where we've got geolocated footage of Ukrainians in its center.  Despite everything the RF threw at the Ukrainian advance (and they threw the kitchen sink), they're slowly, inexorably losing ground. The loss of fifty-percent (plus one) of Robotyne opens more vectors of attack. The sides become harder to hold as Ukraine has a defensive urban environment to sally into the flanks, which allows for removal of mines and an expansion of the local chokepoint (a defender's strongest asset). The Robotyne bastion becomes increasingly untenable with every meter of ground the RF loses. True, it hasn't fallen yet, but I feel it's only a matter of time. And when it does fall, the Ukrainians will move past the worst of the mines. 

Step by bloody step, Ukraine marches on Tokmak.

>Russian milbloggers continue to indicate that Russian forces lack equipment and suffer from low morale along the entire frontline.

It's the antagonistic relationship between the RF officers and the infantry which drew my eye. Those people are at each other's throats. It's a recipe for ""friendly"" fire and dereliction of duty. Shit will not get done unless an officer is directly supervising. That is a HUGE weakness.

>The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) is creating new military formations possibly to allow more combat effective units currently defending in Kherson Oblast to redeploy to more critical sectors of the front.

Russia isn't magicking-up new people. They're condensing units and weakening the Kherson front to bolster the Zaporizhia defense. And when they say 'combat effective' they mean conscripts. Cannon fodder. I sincerely doubt these new units will show up with their full equipment allotment, either. 

However, the weakened defenses in Kherson do present an opportunity, though I doubt Ukraine has the capacity to take full advantage. 

>Russian insider sources indicated that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov may have decisively won Russian President Vladimir’s Putin favor following the June 24 Wagner Group rebellion.

Wonderful! Putin has successfully excised every human of middling competence from his immediate vicinity. The fucking idiot is *still* prioritizing regime and political stability over military affairs. The dumbass doesn't recognize that if the latter fails then the former is irrelevant. He thinks he can survive a military collapse. Fat fucking chance.

>Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin may be attempting to re-establish Wagner in Africa, and some Russian sources are portraying this reported effort as necessary for Wagner’s survival.

Oh, Prigozhin...I'm almost rooting for you, buddy. I mean, I would if he weren't a fucking monster who smashes skulls with a sledgehammer. 

>Some Russian sources are likely running an information operation to exaggerate the degree to which Wagner is struggling to survive, possibly in support of the Russian MoD effort to destroy Prigozhin’s reputation and the whole Wagner Group.

I don't think they're exaggerating too much. There's reports of infighting among Wagner leadership. They're probably pissed Prigozhin lacked the balls to follow through, and they're *definitely* pissed they lost their cushy contracts with the Russian MOD. They're a mercenary company without a client. 

In my opinion NATO has a moral obligation to keep them out of Africa. That poor continent has suffered enough. 

>Russian sources made and walked back claims about significant Russian advances in the Kupyansk direction amid continued offensive actions on August 21.

Evidence of a minor RF breakdown of information space control. Looks like someone got excited and released a prepared statement prior to the proper indicators.

>Russian forces conducted offensive operations near Kreminna, Bakhmut, and along the Avdiivka-Donetsk City line and advanced near Bakhmut.

Bakhmut pushes are counterattacks. Russia lost ground and wants to take it back before Ukraine entrenches itself. View this as an indicator of a positive Ukrainian offensive action. 

>The Russian government continues to introduce mandatory nationalistic and militaristic courses into high school curriculum to promote military service among Russian youth.

In like thirty years I'm going to be in a coffee shop on the moon talking to someone who was a member of the Putler Youth. I'm going to tell them to watch JoJo Rabbit. God, that a was a fucking amazing movie. 

>Belarusian authorities reportedly exposed forcibly deported Ukrainian children to pro-Kremlin propaganda in Belarus.

Huh...I don't really know what to make of this. Looks like the FSB has its hooks pretty deep in Belarus to interfere with something as (currently) inconsequential as child indoctrination. Does anyone know if Belarus presently ships kidnapped Ukrainian children to Russia proper?

Soldiers of the 47th separate mechanized brigade entered the village of ROBOTYNE, which is in the Melitopol direction!

Two months of fierce fighting, and the fighters of our brigade, with the support of other units, broke through the multi-echelon defense line of the occupiers!

The first thing the servicemen did was to notify the locals of the need to leave urgently, because the invaders cynically continues to wipe the village off the face of the earth.

""We waited a year and a half for the ZSU. We grabbed things, documents and ran, throwing away those packages on the way, because life is the most valuable thing. And then these guys from the 47th brigade took us out on a tank,"" - that's how people called the American Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, which withstands mine explosions and direct hits from Invaders artillery.

Already in a safer place, medics of the 47th separate mechanized brigade examined the civilians and gave them the opportunity to call their relatives.

We will publish footage from the village of Robotyne later for the SAFETY of our soldiers. The battles continue and we are entrenched in the achieved boundaries.

Believe in the Armed Forces! Believe in the fighters of the 47th separate mechanized brigade! 5/5

For those wishing to avoid instant brain cancer, the TLDR is Solovyov shouts loudly at his guests that Russia should be using tactical nuclear weapons, because America won't respond (always everything pitched as US!) because they see Ukraine as 'expendable'. He also advocates for leveling all of Ukraine as necessary and 'starting again', and questions how dangerous post-nuclear spaces really are, suggesting there is nothing dangerous about Chernobyl and people live and work there now (lol) and nothing bad happened to the Russian soldiers who went there (lol).

The guests try to moderate him a little, but he shouts them down and doesn't let them speak beyond a single phrase without barking some more.

Finally, he is asked why Russia should resort to nukes if its army is so great. Solovyov has no answer so just makes horrified noises.

It's clear everyone here is speaking with their head half turned over their shoulder, worried they'll say something that doesn't full tow the party line and gets them imprisoned or killed.

Russians have mined no man's land with orders of magnitude more mines than anyone could have imagined.

If Ukrainian vehicles don't all blow up in the minefields, they hit fortifications and remain stationary long enough for Russian artillery to hit them. Russian Ka-52s are also really effective at engaging Ukrainian vehicles at a range beyond ZSU's ability to retaliate. 

Ukraine is making the best of it, conserving manpower and equipment and slowly moving forward. Russia is defending idiotically, throwing away their best most experienced troops and precious vehicles, either of which they can never replenish. 

However there are still a lot of layers of defense and empty fields for Ukraine to cover. The only scenario under which things change dramatically is a complete Russian collapse and rout. Is it possible? Sure. Is it the most likely scenario? No.

No they don't, Russia is incompetent and their attacks have all resulted in massive casualties lately. The average redditor doesn't get it, Ukraine would prefer the Russians come to them. This ""failed counteroffensive"" is all about attacking just enough to get the Russians to reveal themselves so they can be pounded into the dirt with superior Ukrainian firepower and accuracy.

What seems more likely here is that Ukraine will be the side doing the encircling. If they can punch through the second line at Verbove, then they have a legitimate shot at rolling up Polohy. If they can bring that big of a chunk of the first line into contention, then Russia has to seriously consider withdrawing from the Center of their prepared defenses on the Southern front or potentially see a large number of their forces encircled and captured or destroyed.

1. AA defenses have much more bandwidth than the number of drones available, such that probability of evading AA defenses is unrelated to the volume of drones.

2. Intelligence about targets is only valid for a short window after acquisition and waiting a couple of weeks invalidates the target.

The word strategic is often used in media (and social media) wrongly.  But it's hard to know exactly what the strategic regions are in the south - a breakthrough anywhere along the lines that allows a bunch of tanks and IFVs through could allow an advance, so really any real breakthrough point could have strategic aka war-wide implications.

That's just bluster, Putin, or any possible Russian leader, knows they have zero chance of winning a conventional war against NATO and a nuclear one just leaves you at best in a bunker ruling over a pile of ashes that used to be Russia. I just don't see them doing it.

US Law is designed for big companies to create something. Then the US Government takes those things, and passes it to Ukraine.

Its really not designed for little folks to be passing designs back and forth. And anyone doing that kind of thing is going to be assumed to be a foreign spy by US Law (because... in practice, its foreign spies who try to do the stuff you're about to do).

I recognize that 3d printing has made these kinds of small weapon designs easier to talk, prototype, and share.

------------------

I think your best bet is to become a weapons manufacturer officially. I'm not kidding. There's stories about all sorts of small weapon manufacturers making unique items for the US Military.

Once you sell enough to get a reputation, you then work on your ITAR license and all the legal fees involved.

Alternatively, you find a small weapons manufacturer in the USA to commercialize your design and invest. They'll already have an ITAR license and have all the legal ducks in order already.

----------

But in the USA, military-grade weapons production is extremely tightly regulated. For good reason mind you. I recognize that you wanna just mess with things in your backyard using the newest techs.
