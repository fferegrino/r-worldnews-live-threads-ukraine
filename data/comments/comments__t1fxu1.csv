Even as the artillery barrages intensified, not everyone was ready to hide. Walking with intention toward the source of the artillery booms on the outskirts of Kharkiv was Roman Balakelyev, dressed in camouflage, a double-barreled shotgun slung over his shoulder.

“I live here, this is my home. I’m going to defend it,” said Mr. Balakelyev, who also pulled out a large knife he had strapped to his back as if to show it off. “I don’t think the Russians understand me like I understand them.”

A short while later, Mr. Balakelyev reached the edge of the city, where the Ukrainian troops were huddled around the abandoned Russian troop transports. They watched as he passed.

* [Snake Island 13](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-soldiers-snake-island-russia-warship-b2023039.html) - 13 Ukranian Border Guards who told a Russian warship to **""Fuck off!""**

* [sunflower seeds woman](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2022/feb/25/ukrainian-woman-sunflower-seeds-russian-soldiers-video) - Who went right up to armed Russian soldiers and told them to put her sunflower seeds in their pockets so that their corpses may sprout the national flower of Ukraine.

* [punching a bunch of armored vehicles guy](https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-convoy-invasion-ukraine/31723406.html) - Ukranian dude, channeling Florida Man energy to the max, takes on a Russian Armored Column with just his fists

* the [engineer who blew the bridge he was on](https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukrainian-marine-sacrifices-himself-to-blow-up-bridge-ukrainian-military-says)  - No commentary from me here ""Vitaliy Volodymyrovych Skakun, a battalion engineer, had voluntarily undertaken a mission to mine out the support structure of the Genichesky Bridge near the Kyiv before Russian forces could cross it. Shakun did not have time to flee the blast zone before detonating the explosives, and informed his battalion that he would be blowing it up regardless.""

* the [Irish fishing fleet,](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2022/01/how-irish-fishermen-took-russian-fleet-and-won/361377/) - Arguably the funniest and earliest victory in this conflict. A bunch of surly Irish fishermen chased off the Russian Fleet that was planning to do military drills off the Irish coast.
 
* [Grandpa 2 Shirts](https://mobile.twitter.com/azeritimes/status/1497068304053194767) - 80 year old man showed up to volunteer for his country with very minimal belongings. I do not expect he believes he will be going home after this.

The world said Russian army was overwhelmingly powerful, yet they sent you not an army of soldiers, but they sent you untrained men.

The world said they were tactically superior, but they have shown blunder after blunder. 

Putin said you were doing evil deeds and must be stopped, yet they target a single child for a strike, missile strikes to homes, hospitals, schools, and shelled non-military targets. 

They say you are weak, but you are strong! Your leader fights besides you as one of you, not cowering in some far away place barking orders. Your leader is strong, you are strong. Their leader is weak and afraid. 


If the enemy has to break so many international war laws to fight you, that is not a sign os strength, that is a sign of desperation of a weak force.

If the enemy has to threaten nuclear Armageddon for even giving you a bottle of water, that is not strength, that is weakness.


If the enemy has to desperately try to get your soldiers to run and hide by playing mind games, that is not strength, that is weakness. 

They are afraid, they are hungry, tired, and weak. 


You, who are able to tell a warship to go fuck itself, who strikes fear in a so called powerful leader, that is strength, you are strong.


They say russain army is going to make a large scale advance, but remember, you are strong, do not falter and punch them hard in the balls to kindly remind them that you said please when you asked for peace, and they said peace is no longer an option.

""This is a war of Russia's choice. Russia choose to violate humanity, the UN charter. Now people are fleeing all over Ukraine. Metro stations have beomce bomb shelters. Kindergartens attacked. Newborn babies placed in bomb shelters. We have seen heart-breaking images of fathers crying as they send their children away, while they stand behind to defend their country... more than 50.000 people have left Ukraine in the last 48h ..  
We have seen protests in Russia. 

This body was created to prevent War. This attack by Russia was so bold, so brazen taht it violates our system, our values. We believe that this institution still has a place in the 21st century. 

The people in Ukraine soon will need water and shelter. US and Albania have proposed a draft resolution holding Russia to account. It condemns Russian agression.

**It demands the Russian federation to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces. We need to provide humanitarian aide,**

**We are taking a stance and we will impose severe consequences - immediate and economic costs on Russia. Sanctions and Export control that will cut off Russia from vital input, and undercut Russian ambitions to play a role on the world stage.**

**As announced, Biden will sanction Putin and Lavrov themselves.**

History will judge us for our actions, or lack thereof. Russia has already subverted the UN's mission of peace. The rest of us has the obligation to object and stand up.

To those who say ""all are coupable"" - this is a cop-out. Only one country is invading the other, and that is Russia. Take a hard look at the kindergarden.

Fanatics who want to wipe Ukraine off the face of the earth told me he acted out of character. The evidence is mounting. On the radio, Primakov, a former prime minister who worked with him, said he couldn't even recognize the man. When Macron met him, he noticed his strange demeanor.

Human Rights Watch interviewed separately by phone a doctor and an official from the hospital, known as the Central City Hospital, who gave the names of those who were wounded or killed, and shared photographs of two of the dead. Human Rights Watch also verified photographs posted to social media or sent directly by hospital staff that show damage from the attack, including two dead bodies, and the remnant of the weapon that was apparently used, a 9M79-series Tochka ballistic missile with a 9N123 cluster munition warhead.

Even as the artillery barrages intensified, not everyone was ready to hide. Walking with intention toward the source of the artillery booms on the outskirts of Kharkiv was Roman Balakelyev, dressed in camouflage, a double-barreled shotgun slung over his shoulder.
“I live here, this is my home. I’m going to defend it,” said Mr. Balakelyev, who also pulled out a large knife he had strapped to his back as if to show it off. “I don’t think the Russians understand me like I understand them.”
A short while later, Mr. Balakelyev reached the edge of the city, where the Ukrainian troops were huddled around the abandoned Russian troop transports. They watched as he passed. No one moved to stop him. One soldier uttered: “Intent on victory.”

The Russian military decided to not maximally employ its fires capability, which could have inflicted thousands of casualties. Russia likely thought a large number of Ukrainian casualties would make it more difficult to achieve a long-term political solution.

So instead the emphasis has been on speed and reaching Kyiv as rapidly as possible, but not on maximally targeting the Ukrainian military. Russia can escalate if it can't achieve its objectives with its more limited use of force though.

There is no guarantee that Russia can translate this military force into achieving its ambitious political goals, and determined resistance in cities would force Russia to use more force, which would lead to more civilian casualties and make conflict termination more difficult.

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets. The risk of greater Russian and Ukrainian casualties, domestic disapproval, foreign anger economic costs, and difficulty achieving a political solution are all exacerbated the longer this goes on. Speed is critical.

Ukraine isn't occupied. There's some russian military forces on the southern edge and in northern regions. Big cities like Kharkiv, Kyiv, Odessa are under artillery and air attacks whole day, at night it's mostly quiet.

Russians are low on gas now, civilians giving em gasoline with sugar (hehe boi). 

So many died (tens of times more than Ukrainian troopers). They don't know our geography good and this is playing for us. Some civilians injured, a few died. Bombs and rockets now are not only falling at strategic-important points, but also on a common houses, hospitals, schools etc. People are hiding in the bomb shelters, metro and underground levels of buildings. So many evacuated from big cities into villages. 

So many disinformation in social media. The only trusted sources of info are friends now.

I understand why NATO and UN can't help them. And I don't think it's fair to force them to do so. True, what happens with Ukraine right now deserve the utmost priority for help, but they are helping with sanctions right now. It may not seem like much, but when the economy collapsed, it should make Putin thinks about his country's economy too, especially when Russia is banned from everything.
Why they send troops ? Because it will definitely be the beginning of ww3, and nobody wants that. They have to think about their own countries too, their own civilians who will be targeted if ww3 ever happens, not to mention nuclear war. It will be absolutely devastating.

So when they don't do something, try to think logically what will happen to their countries if they do, and maybe that's why they don't. Ukraine's people are important, no question about that, but being the leader of their own countries, their people's safety will be their priority.

* How costly this war will be

Stuff he probably didn't expect:

* Chinese support for Ukraine
* Shooting down ships from Turkey, Japan, etc.

India has already asked for de-escalation of the situation. We haven't supported Putin's efforts, we haven't supported the horrific war crimes happening, we haven't derecognized Ukraine as a sovereign state. 

Yes, we have tried to open trade lines with Russia, paying in rupees, for fertilizers. Before the knives come out, I want you to think about it for moment - this isn't about energy, or weaponry, of technology. This is about food, the thing that's at the very bottom and basic level of the hierarchy of needs. India is still an agrarian society, with 700 million farmers feeding over a billion people. That fertilizer is as important to us as crude oil or precious minerals. A vast section of India is still poor, living not a paycheck to paycheck, but a day to day existence. The fact that I'm typing this on a smartphone, in English, on Reddit, already makes me more privileged then those people could ever imagine to be. 

It hurts when I see abuse hurled at us. It hurts when I see Jen Psaki justify not sanctioning Russian energy as protecting the interests of the US people, as she rightly should, but not face such terrible backlash for it. She's calling it diplomacy, but we're told it's cowardice? We're only doing the same, for millions of people who have families, who've never heard of either Russia or Ukraine, whose only thought is to work, and earn, and live. Who will tell them that their crops and their livelihoods will go to waste to sanction a war that's taking place in a country they've never even envisioned? It sounds callous but that is what the reality is for them. We're abused for this but there are nations who're 3rd and 4th on the list of exporters in fertilizers, but aren't willing to reach out with an alternate deal? Nations that backed our enemy in the war now expect us to side with them against the sole country that did, effectively ruining the single barrier we have in the entire subcontinent without a promise of a better protection? We see a country that gave up its nukes on an agreement that is being honoured in the weakest sense, and feel afraid to strike similar arguments. 

I digress. Cast us as the villains all you want, call us on the wrong side of history, but we don't see anybody reaching out to help out to the right side. Our hands and legs are bound and we can't make that jump without sacrificing the lives and livelihoods of millions of innocents of our own. Even if you can't offer empathy, offer understanding of our situation. This isn't about getting gas to keep us warm or weapons to defend our borders, it's about keeping shelters over the heads of our farmers and food in their bellies. The Indian diaspora you see in your countries, or in the news, or online, is a tiny, tiny portion of India's population. Abuse us all you want, but also pressurize your local politicians to offer alternatives to India. Demand that they undercut current deals to make new ones that allow us to impose the rightful sanctions. None of this is black and white. 

Ukraine is in our hearts every moment. Nobody in this country wants this war or condones it. But it's difficult to keep someone else warm by setting oneself on fire. If that makes me a coward, well. So be it.",False,1645827754.0,t3_t1fxu1,t3_t1fxu1,,0,-8,0,-8,0,0,

Ukraine must realize that Russia could have overrun the country by now if it wanted to. They are proud fighters, but as they say, resistance may be futile. I think Putin's strategy is to get a surrender. If it doesn't come, he may have to take minor action to get it.

Hear me out. There were rumours he has Parkinson's within the last year. Now, there's always rumours, but lets just assume for a second *that* rumour is true. What does a man in his position do? Well, the first thing he will want is to get medication from his doctor to minimalize symptoms, he sure as hell can't afford to show weakness. So what does his doctor do? Well, the first thing they'll prescribe is actual Parkinson's medication. 

&nbsp;

Here comes the problem. There isn't much to chose from. And the ones that exist all have the same exact problem. It has in recent times come out that medication, can **seriously** mess with your frontal cortex, and *impulse control* in particular. And general practitioners are not really aware on a general basis. We had one published example here, an accomplished doctor. He described how he'd do insanely impulsive things like fall in love with surfing on a holiday (he was in his 60's) and proceed to buy surf boards *for his entire family*. Completely out of character for him. Sounds innocent? The more common result; lots of patients have taken up gambling and gambled fortune, house and marriages away. Completely void of risk aversion.

Just one hitting a population center would be a catastrophe, not just from the explosion but the fallout. If multiple hit...well, that's not good for everyone. That's why NATO/EU are tip-toeing around Russia right now. If Russia didn't have nukes, pretty good odds NATO/EU would have rolled Russia by now.

Of course some funds by charities like UNICEF will be used for fundraising, but majority of your donation will go to direct humanitarian action. And a larger organisation such as UNICEF is able to make better use of these donations by pooling them together.

On top of this, I've also shared links by the Ukrainian government, which detail where they believe donations would be best placed.

In terms of contacting representatives, there are others in this thread and others sharing that information. I, personally, have contacted my MP expressing my views, asking them to share my views (particularly in parliament), and to pressure my government to push forward with further sanctions and further action.

Then nearly a million directly dying when launching a full-scale invasion by false pretenses and false motives (as a US citizen we must recognize this is the reality) for years to topple the government, leading to political instability and increased terrorism in the entire region? Setting back these countries decades in progress, costing millions of lives, ruining millions of others, and pissing away tens of trillions of OUR money to accomplish exactly nothing besides enriching OUR oligarchs, e.g. defense/arms contractors and manufacturers and corporate executives.

So if, say, China decided that the U.S. government has gotten so corrupt by corporations and dark money interest, and its citizens aren’t given any significant choices in their elections, as well as increased violence, poverty, debt, misery and suffering for the benefit only of our wealthy, and if they classified our government as a “dangerous plutocracy”. Would your logic then follow that it’s OK if they decided to launch a massive invasion of millions of soldiers landing on US soil and launching missile strikes on our cities and infrastructure to “liberate Americans from their evil, corrupt regime” and install another government at their whims after the deaths and suffering of millions of us?

You see why this is problematic, right? Anyone can claim anyone else deserves invading because of “democracy” and more often than not it isn’t the actual motive. This is OUR corporate/pro-war/intervention propaganda at work here. Don’t let yourself fall for the trap that our major corporate news outlets are benevolent forces for “truth” and that they actually report 100% truth.

I don't think it's about wanting to be a world power (I'd argue by most measures Russia is a significant world power already; not on the level of US or China, but nobody other than those two are.)

The buffer state idea comes from a very game-theory outlook, that if you are not 'winning' a situation you are losing. Yes, I agree with you that shouldn't be the basis of foreign policy in the 21st century, but it still rules the day in many ways. 

I think the main reason for being so fixated on getting political control over Ukraine is because it is culturally and historically so closely linked with Russia, if Ukraine were to develop and see improvements due to Western-based associations, that could start to undermine Russians' perspectives on their own situation. A thriving, Western-linked Ukraine would make Russia look bad domestically and undercut a lot of the rhetoric and rationale that is used to keep the current government at least generally accepted. 

And yes, there is a certain element of 'I will do this because I can', which comes from ego, I agree. I just see it as part of a larger strategic outlook than just because of mad selfish ambition.",False,1645831279.0,t3_t1fxu1,t1_hyfzqob,,5,6,0,6,0,0,
