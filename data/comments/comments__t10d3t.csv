He repeats the line from Vladimir Putin that Moscow does not want to occupy Ukraine - but rather ""demilitarise"" it.

Asked whether it was Russia's wish to topple a democratic country, Lavrov implies the country can not be called democratic.

He then makes claims about Ukraine's treatment of Russian-speaking people in the country.

Turkey cannot stop Russian warships accessing the Black Sea via its straits, as Ukraine has requested, due to a clause in an international pact that allows vessels to return to their home base, the Turkish foreign minister said.

Reuters reports:

Ukraine has appealed to Turkey to block Russian warships from passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits which lead to the Black Sea, after Moscow on Thursday launched a full-blown assault on Ukraine from land, air and sea.

Russian forces landed at Ukraine‚Äôs Black and Azov Sea ports as part of the invasion.

Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the straits and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened, but the request has put the Nato member in a difficult position as it tries to manage its Western commitments and close ties with Russia.

Speaking in Kazakhstan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey was studying Kyiv‚Äôs request but said Russia had the right under the Convention to return ships to their home base, in this case the Black Sea.

So even if Turkey decided after a legal process to accept Ukraine‚Äôs request and close the straits to Russian warships, he said, they would only be prevented from travelling in the other direction, away from their home base into the Mediterranean.",False,1645785815.0,t3_t10d3t,t3_t10d3t,,0,62,0,62,0,0,

Kremlin says Russians ""do not have the right to organize protest actions"" without permission


The Russian government has said that people who are against the country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine ‚Äúdo not have the right to organize protest actions‚Äù without seeking permission first.

‚ÄúUnder the law, without following the appropriate procedures, these citizens do not have the right to organize protest actions in order to express their point of view,‚Äù Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a conference call with foreign journalists. 

Hundreds of protesters were detained by police on Thursday during anti-war demonstrations, with Russian riot police dispersing people via loudspeakers in Moscow, according to CNN teams in the city.

Under Russian law, large demonstrations require protesters apply for a permit, which has to be submitted no more than 15 but no less than 10 days before the event. Heavy fines -- and in some cases even prison time -- can be imposed on those who protest without a permit.

Individuals are allowed to stage solo ‚Äúsingle pickets,‚Äù but it is not unheard of for people to be detained for those as well.

‚ÄúThere are single pickets, but such‚Ä¶ well, I would not say mass events‚Ä¶ but events with the participation of a certain number of people - they are simply not allowed by law. And therefore, certain measures were taken against them,‚Äù Peskov added. 


Peskov conceded that there are Russians who are against what the Kremlin continues to describe as a ‚Äúspecial operation,‚Äù and that the government needs to ‚Äúbetter explain [its motives] to these citizens.‚Äù He also suggested there are more Russians in favor of the invasion than against. 

‚ÄúThe President hears everyone's opinion and understands the proportions of those who have a different point of view and those who are sympathetic to such necessary operations,‚Äù Peskov said.

MUMBAI, Feb 25 (Reuters) - India is exploring ways to set up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia to soften the blow on New Delhi of Western sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, government and banking sources said.

Indian officials are concerned that vital supplies of fertilizer from Russia could be disrupted as sanctions intensify, threatening India's vast farm sector.

India has called for an end to violence in Ukraine but refrained from outright condemnation of Russia, with which it has long-standing political and security ties.

Russia invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday in the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.

Russian forces pressed their advance on Friday and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy pleaded with the international community to do more, saying sanctions announced so far were not enough.

Officials said the plan was to get Russian banks and companies to open accounts with a few state-run banks in India for trade settlement, a banking source involved in the discussions said.

""This is a proactive move assuming that the conflict escalates and there could be a slew of sanctions in place,"" the source said.

""In this case we would not be able to settle the transaction in dollars and so an arrangement has been proposed to set up a rupee account, which is being considered.""

Funds in such accounts act as a guarantee of payment for trade exchanged between two countries, while the parties barter commodities from each other to offset the sum, the source said.

A similar arrangement, in which part of the settlement with Russia is in foreign currency and rest is through local rupee accounts, was also being explored, said the banking and the government source.

Such mechanisms are often used by countries to shield themselves from the blow of sanctions and India also used it with Iran after it came under Western sanctions for its nuclear weapons programme, the source said.

The programme was introduced in 2012 and worked well for several years.

The discussions on Russia were still at an early stage and formal talks had not yet begun between the two sides, an Indian government official said.

EU leaders agreed on Thursday to impose new economic sanctions on Russia, joining the United States and Britain in trying to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies for the attack.

The sanctions impede Russia's ability to do business in major currencies and target individual banks and state-owned enterprises.

The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. None of the sources wanted to be identified as the discussions are private.

Russia's exports to India stood at $6.9 billion in 2021, mainly mineral oils, fertilisers and rough diamonds, while India exported $3.33 billion worth of goods to Russia in 2021, mainly pharmaceutical products, tea and coffee. Russia and Belarus usually account for nearly a third of India's total potash imports. It would not be feasible to replace them amid a rally in fertilizer prices to a record high, a senior industry official told Reuters.

New Delhi is also holding a meeting with fertilizer industry officials on Friday to explore ways to secure supplies from Russia and Belarus, said a senior fertilizer industry official, who declined to be identified.

>To underscore the potential consequences for Russia, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, delivered a stark message to his Russian counterpart when they spoke in late December: Yes, General Milley said, the Ukrainian military stands little chance of repelling the larger, better armed Russian force.

>But a swift victory would be followed, General Milley told Gen. Valery Gerasimov, by a bloody insurgency, similar to the one that led the Soviet Union to leave Afghanistan in 1989, according to officials familiar with the discussion.

>General Milley did not detail to General Gerasimov the planning underway in Washington to support an insurgency, a so-called ‚Äúporcupine strategy‚Äù to make invading Ukraine hard for the Russians to swallow. That includes the advance positioning of arms for Ukrainian insurgents, including Stinger antiaircraft missiles, that could be used against Russian forces. 

The Javelins, Stingers etc. weren't really intended to be effective against the type of invasion Russia has conducted so far: air and missile strikes/long range artillery. Or if they just invade but do not occupy. I doubt it's Ukraine's intention to fight to the last man to hold Kyiv, but rather to fall back and blend in at some point. No one ever believed that Ukraine could hold off 150,000+ troops coming at them from 3 sides, but they also didn't believe for a second that Putin doesn't intend to occupy Ukraine, and that this porcupine strategy is what they're planning around, including the U.S. and allies supporting that insurgency in the future.

Telephone conversation with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad

 At the initiative of the Syrian side, Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with President of the Syrian Arab Republic Bashar al-Assad.

 February 25, 2022 14:00
 The President of Syria expressed his strong support for the special military operation carried out by Russia to protect the civilian population of the Donbass republics, while condemning the destabilizing policy of the United States and NATO, which at one time led to a serious degradation of the situation in the Middle East.  Thanking Bashar al-Assad for such a principled position, Vladimir Putin, in turn, shared his assessment of the development of the situation in the context of the decisions taken and being implemented by Russia.

 The leaders discussed the subject of the Syrian settlement and, in particular, the promotion of the political process within the Astana format in order to ensure the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Syria.

 A number of issues of bilateral cooperation, primarily in the trade and economic sphere, were considered.

So they have to keep staggering them bit by bit to be shown to be doing something as time passes. Because if you just go all in on sanctions on day one and he doesn't stop the attack, then what more can you threaten on day two? 

It all just seems like a political game where everyone is pretending to help and saying the right things, but only to save face, because they all realise their words aren't going to do shit. Only direct action is going to have an effect and it's clear that that's not going to happen. 

You'd expect the intelligence services to have an idea what kind of sanctions would truly stop this invasion, and if they had that answer then surely they'd use it before it gets too late?

I'd honestly appreciate some reassurance that I'm completely wrong because this is fucking awful

EDIT: Thanks for the responses guys. Sounds like these sanctions aren't expected to help Ukraine, but to destroy Russia over time. Seems like a bit of bullshit that the media is dominated by these sanction headlines, when realistically it makes absolute zero difference to the people and country of Ukraine. I understand its difficult for countries to actually help Ukraine directly, I just wish they'd stop pretending that these press talks are actually doing anything.

Lavrov referenced Western interventions in the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya - which he said caused thousands of casualties in the name of promoting democracy.

Third, nations can DECIDE to invoke A5, it isn't automatic. A Turkish ship was hit by a rocket, and Turkey has DECIDED to not escalate via A5 because there is no clear and present danger to their nation.

Our economy was already very bad, just look at our public debt, pre-Covid, and got even worse during the last couple of years. Given the recent virus situation, we are barely starting to see some light ahead of the tunnel. 

Another hit though, would cripple the country and Russia/Ukraine are decent trading partners, especially regarding gas imports. Note that we use gas also to produce energy, decades ago we had the brilliant idea to ban nuclear reactors and never bothered with improving others sources. 

As a final note, the last batch of energy/gas bills got their dues tripled (no exaggeration), another hit and we would see a riot in the streets, probably.

Don't take this comment as an excuse, just a bunch of info

PS: note that Putin wasn't unanimously seen as a bad leader up until the last week, actually our right-wing leaders praised him many times in the past

PPS: the whole ""trust in EU"" thing doesn't work, there is already a strong anti-EU current. The whole migrant's situation over the last decade hasn't helped a bit in that regard, the general idea is that we are/were left on our own when there is no gain in it

We should have put a carrier group in the Black Sea as a deterrent to Putin invasion plans under the premise of us establishing a no fly zone for the Russian Air Force. We should have also deployed some of our ballistic missile subs to the region as a deterrent also for them being that close should have put the fear of God into Putin.

I am an American and we all need to stand together against Putin he is using a similar playbook as Hitler did with Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland land grab then later the invasion of Czechoslovakia itself. Putin took Crimea and looks to be trying to take Ukraine now through a possible puppet government if reports and/or projections are accurate. Additionally this could be a first step in recreating the territory that the Soviet Union once controlled of which Putin has said the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the single greatest tragedy of 20th century.

The US won't sanction Russian energy. The UK won't really sanction the billionaires living in London and pumping money into their football clubs. They sure as hell will jump in like vultures on both Ukraine and Russia, and continue outsourcing their work to the South East Asian seaboard while simultaneously denigrating the people that live there.

Is it because it's a European war compared to a Middle Eastern war?

You make so many valid points: and people need to understand the centuries of history that cause the connection (as well as rifts) between Russians and Ukrainians are also guilty for the mindset of the people of these populations. Their world view and fear of their government is almost genetic. My own family left Russia during the Bolshevik revolution. They spent a generation in China before moving west. They still have those imbedded fears, nerves, and mistrust ingrained in their Slavic souls. Be it Tsars, Soviet Leaders, Russian Federation and Ukrainian Leaders, they have been bred to fear and disbelieve them, and one another. 

I wish the Ukrainian people know so many Russians stand side by side them in solidarity - including those of us pseudo-Russians in the western diaspora - and we support those people in Russia who also long to be free of mad men leaders - be it openly against or in their minds voice. I don‚Äôt judge those who cower and don‚Äôt protest through fear: we understand why. 

Hopefully these recent events will add to our common resolve and together and with international support we will communally wake up and start to make the changes we so desire and bring Russia back into the bosom of Europe where she belongs. Not as an adversary, oh yin to other‚Äôs yang - but as a partner, neighbour and friend.

I've been profoundly annoyed by their repeated decision to decommission nuclear power plants and build yet more pipelines for buying Russian gas and oil, all while pretending to be serious about climate change.

Now this *blatantly obvious and entirely predictable* invasion has kicked off, and they're stuck with their economic hands tied, by their own doing.

I know the decisions that got them here are complex, and I'm not making the claim that the USA hasn't been just as stupid and irrational and greedy (probably moreso actually), but this dependence on Russian gas is exacerbating one of the worlds leading threats to peace and security.

On the other hand, I am very glad to hear that nevertheless, there appears to be significant pressure within Germany to cut Russia off from SWIFT.

That's quite a good start, but I hope they can make a plan to get through the winter, make the conscious choice to make a sacrifice, and do the thing I'm sure Putin genuinely does not expect, cutting off Russian oil and gas imports.

And yes, there's also a very valid excuse for non-intervention due to the risk of escalation. Personally, I think we should have called the bluff and put forces in before the intervention as a tripwire force, but that's easy for me to say after the fact.

Now as to whether or not Putin would attack NATO or not in future escalations, that's different. I actually don't think that it's completely certain that he won't -- if he thinks he can get away with the scenario where internal support for US/other allies fulfilling their article 5 commitments doesn't happen, then I think he absolutely would. 

I'll frame the rest of my comment from the perspective of a US citizen as to how this could happen:

Thing is (and you can probably see by the comments just in this thread alone) - there's a substantial portion of our population advocating against military intervention of any kind whatsoever in current situations in europe. It does seem to me that at this point there's quite a few people that would be ok with doing nothing more than ""strongly condemn"" Russia even in the highly unlikely event they were to nuke someone -- so long as it isn't the US, simply because ""if we do start then it's going to be the end of the world""

While theoretically, that's a moot point and we will fulfill our article 5 responsibilities regardless if, as an example, Poland gets invaded... I'm not so sure of that honestly. As an illustrative example, please see a [recent 2020 study](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/02/09/nato-seen-favorably-across-member-states/pg_2020-02-09_nato_0-03/) \- while it does not include the US in the ""our country should use military force"" question, it is a very real concern across many of the NATO member states. It's very easy to use the same excuse (debates on whether said excuse is valid or not aside) that the US cannot get involved or we go into MAD, better to sacrifice a country or ten, we used here in Ukraine to justify not getting involved; and hey, I get it -- I don't really want to go out in a ball of nuclear fire either you know?

This is where putting those extra forces in NATO nations comes in useful - I've seen some comments in this thread deriding it for being a useless symbolic gesture. While certainly symbolic, I don't think it is useless: in my mind it is more of a commitment than to serve a tangible defensive purpose (although they certainly can hold their own!). It's a lot harder for people to stomach using that excuse when your own country's troops have already died, and thus 1) prevents Putin from thinking he can get away with it and 2) reassures those allies that we *won't* be making excuses to not intervene if they do get attacked, because if they get attacked, our troops die, and we are thus forcibly already in military conflict.",False,1645793301.0,t3_t10d3t,t1_hydggr1,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

‚ÄúI will stress: read what Putin said. No strikes on civilian infrastructure, no strikes on the personnel of the Ukrainian army, on their dormitories, or other places not connected to the military facilities. The statistics that we have confirm this,‚Äù Lavrov said.

‚ÄúNobody is going to somehow degrade the Ukrainian Armed Forces. We are talking about preventing Neo-Nazis and those promoting genocide from ruling this country,‚Äù he continued.

If Russia becomes internationally isolated, then they would have to rely upon their internal economy. This means that they would need to source all goods and services from inside their own country. This is called an [AUTARKY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky).

Russia is vast. The amount of raw materials they potentially have is huge.

They also have a large population. 145 million people. That's a significant amount of people that can be utilised for an economy, as both consumers and producers.

In terms of food they have some very productive agricultural land. They can feed themselves.

Of course the problem is in the transition to an autarky. The economy would be severely restricted for many years. If we assume the Russians allow a well oiled and regulated free market to grow, then enterprises will eventually start up to profit from demand. But this will take time. 

They will also have to develop their own tech industry. All those computers and laptops and mobile phones that people and businesses need will have to be sourced internally, and it'll take time for them to do this.",False,1645788324.0,t3_t10d3t,t1_hyd7t81,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is very perceptive.

Back in the postwar period, it was believed that freeing up trade between nations would be a way to promote peace and democracy. And this was sort of true, since the nations that dominated international trade were liberal democracies.

But the rot really showed up in the 1970s. Saudi Arabia and other oil nations were making fortunes from liberal democracies but weren't becoming liberal democracies themselves. And what were the Saudis doing with all that money? Some of it went into radical Islam - Al Qaeda and Bin Laden were funded by members of the Saudi government. But a lot of it just went back to America as lobbying and to gain influence in US politics.

And this has continued. Russia and China are both huge donors to political parties in Liberal Democratic countries. And the result is not a growth in liberal democracy in these countries, but an erosion of liberal democracy in western countries.

I believe the solution is to have a Liberal Democratic trade bloc, in which only liberal democracies can trade with one another. Those outside of the bloc are excluded from trading... however any country that approaches the bloc and promises to set up changes to their country to become liberal democratic will be able to join provisionally.",False,1645789626.0,t3_t10d3t,t1_hyda78k,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Too many people on reddit don't realise just how serious that is for their own lives. Countries aren't in the business of sacrificing their own citizens to help the citizens of another at substantial cost to themselves without substantial upside. It doesn't work that way and if it did, the countries your in right now would be in much worse positions than they are today and your life might even look more like that of the Ukrainians.

Seizing Russian assets seems like a much smarter decision. Upside for the host country and cuts Putin's legs out. Why would you stab yourself in the knee whilst this is an option?

All men in their 20s are required to spend 12 or 18 months (I'm not totally sure on this detail) in basic military service. Even once they complete this obligation, they can be recalled to active service if war ever breaks out.

Many European countries either still use conscription (all of Scandinavia and Greece, to name the most notable) or discontinued the practice within the last 20 years (just about all other countries on the continent except for the UK).

While I totally agree with your sentiment that this is a terrible humanitarian crisis, the majority of people who grew up in this sort of country are going to be familiar with basic military service and any potential duties to their country. I grew up facing this, served my time and would then have been able to be recalled for a period of 15 years.

I don't want to get too far afield by talking about how conscripted forces are a relic of the 20th century, but if a country's population believes this type of military recruitment isn't to their advantage, they can always change it.

Shut reddit / the news / social media down for the night. Close your bedroom curtains and if you have anything to cover your eyes like a headband or maybe even a beanie hat, use it as an eye mask to keep out the morning light.  
  
Set an alarm for 1pm. Get six hours sleep - it's not a lot, but it's enough for people who wake up and go do a 10-12 hour shift in some places of the world, so it'll be okay for you. And if you don't manage 6 hours sleep, let's say you only get 2 or 3, that's still perfectly okay so long as you were in bed resting for the rest of the time. Your body will still thank you for not wasting your energy.  
   
 At 1pm, get up and make a coffee or drink an energy drink. Resist the urge to check your phone or watch the news. Go in the shower.   
   
Spend the next 3 hours skim reading as many of your notes  / books as possible for exam prep. While you do it, write the key points out into a notebook in bullet points. Read them out loud to yourself while you do it and after you finish.  
    
Yes, even if you think you will definitely remember those things and even if you feel stupid doing it. Research shows that we remember things better when we take them in by as many of our senses as possible - so read them, speak and hear them, and 'feel' them by writing them down by hand. Maybe don't lick them and taste them though :)   
   
Grab some more caffeine, grab some chewing gum (aids concentration), grab your bullet points and take them with you to the exam. Keep looking at them until the very last moment possible.

2) Putin will just nuke us/escalation etc. etc. - Brilliant. So when Putin invades a NATO country we suddenly don't fight because 'he might nuke us'? We have artificial lines drawn here about what we can and can't do. Invade Poland - fight and Putin won't nuke us but invade Ukraine - don't fight because he might nuke us

Ukrainian air defense appeared to have shot down a missile or plane during the night, which crashed in a residential area. Fighting continues to rage across the country, and **Ukraine also appears to have shot a missile at a Russian airfield in the Rostov region, which borders the Donbas, appearing to have destroyed aircraft in the process.** In a meeting of European leaders, French President Emmanuel Macron also pledged that Europe would provide an additional $1.3 billion in economic aid to Ukraine.Still, the situation has grown increasingly dire for Ukraine. Russian troops have now entered the capital city of Kyiv and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has made a plea for ordinary citizens to build Molotov cocktails to hurl at Russian forces entering the city. Russia continues to pursue a ""decapitation"" strategy of prioritizing the capture of the Ukrainian capital, possibly in hopes of deflating Ukrainian morale to trigger a collapse of other Ukrainian fronts. /u/Isentrope

My roots grow from there. I grew up there.

I clearly understand that an eastern Ukrainian really has much more in common with western Russians than with western Ukrainians (language, religion, common culture). All these 8 years, many world economies have simply used this conflict to sell weapons to both sides. Now these same economies are imposing sanctions and pretending that what is happening is news to them. 

For decades they gladly hosted the oligarchs. They sold real estate for cash, provided them with bank accounts and safe deposit boxes, sold their citizenships for money and opportunities to earn money. And now, instead of helping to hold a fair referendum, protect western Ukraine tactically (only way right now) and do everything possible for real diplomatic negotiations, they decide simply wait as long as possible, Right now they are just looking for an excuse to cash in on this conflict again.

Do everything to ensure that Putin and Zelensky peacefully sit down at the negotiating table as soon as possible. Each new day of the war brings new victims, panic, looting.

  
Control the conduct of a truly fair referendum in the eastern part of Ukraine.

  
Do not be surprised if, even with the events of recent days, eastern Ukrainians want to secede independently or become part of Russia. This will not be a hoax, most of the territories bordering Russia are indeed much more ""Russian"" than Western Ukrainian. This is not the choice of ""Putin or democracy"", this is the choice of their usual religion, language, culture - relatives and friends living a few tens of kilometers on the other side of the border. I already answered here that for the main part of Ukraine the war began three days ago and it was unleashed by the Russians. For the LPR and the DPR, it began eight years ago, it never stopped, and the provocation was mutual.

  
Ensure the security of the western part of Ukraine and its borders.

There's a huge gap between intervention and nukes.

  
Firstly if Russia plays dirty with little green men why cant the west? Theres already so many western volunteers fighting.

Secondly the west will not use Nukes as a first strike and if the Russian military leadership is rational neither will they. Its not just Putin with a button. Launching nukes require a chain of command all to say yes, down to the corporal pressing the launch button. The possibility of it getting this bad is not likely.

Thirdly the West couldve done more and sent more arms since 2014. Only did we start sending NLAWs, JAVELINS and MANPADS in the last few months and none of this and sanctions successfully deterrred Putin from going for the riskiest move. A full scale invasion.

Its not something I would do, but it would put the nuclear hot potato back in Putin's lap.

If this really is for his legacy, which idk that it can be anything else...then his legacy would be the man who ended the world. I think calling his bluff would actually work, but obviously not worth the risk

Also what is to say Putin won't threaten nuclear war against NATO countries, particularly to control Baltics down the road? He can bluff his way with nukes through Europe if he really wanted to, it is something eventually humanity is going to have to contend with

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it.

I dont care if they are in a country with a different name for the most part we share the exact same wants and needs and its disheartening to think we are not going to do whatever we can to help them.

Maybe people are right and we shouldn't I just don't agree with that. 

But yeah I'm sitting in the comfort of my home not hearing alarms and fighting going on so its easy for me to say I just can't ever justify not doing whatever we can to help. Regardless of what putin threatens.

Its not as if the majority of Russian population is on board with there corrupt government because they are not and I dont wish anybody anywhere to have to live under that type of oppression.

Looking at the science behind nuclear missile defense shows that the fundamental problem is perhaps as complicated or moreso as any AI problem, but with underlying hardware that will cost at minimum billions of dollars.

Our publicly available ICBM defense capabilities have a predicted 50% likelihood of success at intercepting ICBMs.

We have all but certainly developed and deployed more advanced defensive systems in limited locations (especially aboard ships, where the existence of some of our ""not officially public"" anti missile tech is a pretty open secret. You can see the things in photos).

However, there are other types of missiles that are much harder to defend against, and we very likely have not deployed more highly advanced anti missile systems in a total protective shell around Russia or the US.

In the event of a full scale nuclear attack from Russia, I think the most likely outcome is the almost complete denuclearization and demilitarization of Russia, probably within a few minutes or hours, but also tens of millions of deaths in the US and hundreds of millions of deaths in NATO countries as a whole.

This assumes China and other nuclear powers do not launch nuclear attacks against NATO, which they almost definitely will not do under circumstances like these.

China for example will be very glad at the opportunity to stay *all* the way out of that bullshit, and to end up with no domestic damage and a full nuclear stockpile. India will likely think similar thoughts. It makes little sense for them to light themselves up as a target in a nuclear war between US and Russia, because even after glassing half of Russia the US nuclear and conventional military power would be staggering, and simply unprofitable to attack.

China may even offer humanitarian aid to both Russia and NATO countries in the aftermath. It would surprise me if they didn't. A very good opportunity to come out of the conflict with a massively improved reputation and increased international influence, for relatively little cost and pretty much no risk.

In fact, modern reactors are typically built in this way, and do not pose significant radiation risk when targeted by conventional explosives of essentially any magnitude, because if the way in which the reaction chamber and fuel assembly are designed to fail.

Think huge vaults of sand suspended above, and the molten salt system designed to dump over that, and reaction designs that can't go supercritical, channels for molten fuel to disperse into chambers under the ground, structural designs made to cave in in a certain way and form a good seal over the fuel no matter what angle they are destroyed from or what vector the forces are applied.

Fukushima for example had measures proposed to prevent catastrophe in *exactly* the case that ended up happening, and those measures were cut for cost reasons despite the catastrophic failure scenario being predicted as an almost statistical certainty over the course of the facilities lifespan. Japan gets waves big enough to have caused that crisis pretty predictably over long time spans.

It is also worth noting that the reopening of coal fired power plants actually contributed significantly more harm to the German people than even a nuclear disaster may have, by an enormous margin.

The reason Putin makes such over the top aggressive language when even the possibility of Nato involvement is mentioned is because he knows he would be utterly fucked if they intervened militarily. If the war stayed conventional, he'd lose and be overthrown, and nuclear threats are hollow when the other side is just as capable of exterminating your people with their own arsenal.

Put yourself in Russia's shoes. 

Imagine if 1 month ago, when they started to enter the final stages of their plan to invade Ukraine, a hostile global superpower, with the largest most advanced conventional military in the world, a network of global alliances and a massive nuclear arsenal had announced it had signed a defensive pact with Ukraine and would be deploying US troops there. Are you really going to push ahead with the invasion and start shooting?

Hell, what if that superpower had just said they wouldn't deploy any troops in advance of an invasion, but in the event of any russian incursion, at the request by the ukraininan government they would institute a no fly zone and respond proportionately if their planes were attacked? Would you still invade, knowing your ground forces would be horribly vulnerable, and firing on american planes might trigger a chain reaction which leads to the downfall of your country and the death of everyone on the planet?  Would the invasion really be worth that risk? Would your generals agree to take that risk?

Simply put the point where this invasion became an absolute certainty was the point where Biden ruled out any military action to defend Ukraine. At that point Putin was certain those risks no longer existed. Why on earth would you give him that certainty? 

No one wants a nuclear war but it seems we've replaced  MAD with a new doctrine called 'russia can do whatever the fuck it wants because we forgot we also have a nuclear deterrent.'

But the reason Russia can invade Ukraine right now is because it's not a NATO member state. Russia dares the west to intervene and sets a precedent that non-members are fair game.

Invading a member state is completely untested, and allowing it would set the precedent that invading member states is acceptable. Permitting that would go against the very simplest strategic doctrine. Once Russia is engaged with NATO, it is completely, wildly outgunned in conventional warfare.

NATO was started as an anti-Soviet military alliance at the beginning of the Cold War. You would think that since the Soviet Union dissolved and is no longer socialist there would be no more need for a NATO but since then they have expanded in several countries that were once part of the Soviet Union (Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania). So for decades basically all political figures in Russia, not just Putin, have objected to this expansion as a repurposed military alliance aimed at encircling Russia. 

NATO says it‚Äôs a defensive alliance but went on to topple governments in Libya, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan after the Cold War. Given this history, Russia probably has fears about being the next target. Their objection to NATO expansion isn‚Äôt exactly unreasonable either considering NATO made several promises that the NATO alliance wouldn‚Äôt expand past Germany. Those promises have since been broken with western leaders openly dreaming of regime change inside Russia itself, again probably not helping the paranoia of the ones in charge. 

In the early 2010s the Ukraine wanted no part in NATO, specifically during Viktor Yanukovyvh. I‚Äôm going to skip over some history right now but eventually this lead to literal armed Nazis (Azov Battalion) seizing the presidents palace. These protesters were openly supported by American politicians and ushered in a new far-right anti-Russian government that aggressively sought Ukraine membership in NATO. From Russias perspective you can see why the coup in Ukraine was pretty serious. They were already surrounded by NATO countries and foreign powers had previously invaded Russia through Ukraine in BOTH world wars. The addition of Ukraine would guarantee that any future clash on Russias border would trigger mutual defense obligation from all NATO and thus WW3.

On top of that, when people in the eastern Ukrainian region called the Donbas rejected the new coup government and sought closer ties with Russia, a civil war began where the western part of Ukraine has been killing its own people for the last 7 years. There is a ceasefire called the Minsk agreement that has not been honored and thus brings us to today. 

So yes, it is Putin and his oligarchs decision to invade Ukraine but history does shows that NATO instigated and inflamed what is currently happening. In the end it is just going to cost thousands of lives on both sides.",1645787569.0,1645786488.0,t3_t10d3t,t1_hyd503w,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

Also that comes to and end of course. Nuclear is not renewable in the same sense of solar energy is, we will run out of fuel there as well.

Having said that. We need something that we can apply at scale, and that we can control. And we need it like yesterday. Apart from our energy dependence from horrible regimes (which should be enough reason to switch), climate change is the existential threat that is hanging over our head like the sword of Damocles. Nuclear power is clean, it's scalable and it's safe. 

Solar/wind come with massive problems with regard to reliability (it doesn't work at night or when it's not windy) and storage technology is not there yet to solve that issue. Conventional green energy does help, but only in combination with something that we can scale at instant (like a nuclear power plant). Using solar panels by day, and then a nuclear plant by night. That would be a way to go before we have proper nuclear fusion reactors.

Either way, to keep it short. I agree with you on nuclear power. But with the caveat that it's because I see it as a necessity that we have to use as a bridge towards ""real"" green alternatives rather than as a permanent solution. The situation is too urgent to wait on other alternatives to develop. I honestly think many people don't see the gravity of the situation we're in.

Just don't eat the dirt after and take a few potassium iodide pills and you'll be fine.


2) Even if every nuke on the planet was hit, they wouldn't be evenly distributed and many of the areas that would take the most strikes are relatively unpopulated. e.g. roughly half of the weapons that would likely be hit if Russia sent all of its nukes to the US would land in rural North Dakota, Montana and around the Wyoming/Colorado border. Because that's where we keep most of our ICBMs. But relatively few people live there. 

3) The worst cause fall out scenario wouldn't do it, but even if it did, preferred detonation methods do not create particularly high levels of radioactive fall out. Airburst and ground penetrating weapons both bring up much less material into the atmosphere than surface strike weapons. Airburst may have 0 fall out if detonated at a high enough altitude.

There is no bluff.  

  Russia has created a crisis BECAUSE civilized nations desire Russian collaboration in peaceful harmony‚Äîand that moment is currently impossible. 

For example, Russia could have encouraged Ukraines entrance into EU, submitted their own bid, and negotiated entrance into NATO as a new ally and in time tilted the balance of power away from war and into one of prosperity.  

However, Putin is adrift and unable to think beyond his grave - the box that claims all men - and so has shit the bed, rolling tanks where he can, into a self selected democratic government that does not desire war. 

This is alarming‚Äîthe dream of a unified European continent is dead; Russia has chosen the path of madness; the rest of humanity must assume the tanks will not stop.  What assurances are there to the contrary?

And as you mention, renewables have a lot of issues. And the biggest problems I see with them is resource requirement (you need way more renewable energy systems for equivalent energy production), and the area requirement, as things like potential wind or sun in any given area is mostly finite, and even with 100% efficiency in solar panels across 24/h per day, there is still only so much energy you can get per m^2. This means that in practice renewables will require a lot more excavation and intrusion into nature to place these renewable systems, which I am kind of against. If they are placed in urban areas, its okay. But covering up entire shore lines or the sahara desert in solar panels (which has huge ecological consequences) is very problematic.

 And there is all the huge issues with storage, like you mentioned. UK/Germany are apparently considering making huge hydrogen gas pipelines etc which seems like insanity in my eyes.


I'd like to see nuclear as the ""baseline"" and then a portion of the energy mix should be covered by renewables, and if nuclear is less flexible than natural gas then just use energy conversion through storages to counteract that issue.

I just don't want to see the entire planet covered in renewable power systems, especally that so much of the ecological systems are threatned towards extinction.

Ultimately the hard truth is that the West or NATO can not directly topple Putin. Only his own people in Russia can do that. Thats also exactly why this is happening right now.

Truthfully we have a better chance of Mossad taking out Putin than anything else if it truly became that close.

Empires always fall. They never last forever. Who ends up where is determined by the pages of time.

It has to be his own people (probably someone from his inner circle giving in to the outside pressure of the russian people and their own interests ultimately).

Nobody else can do it. And the issue is that these people around Putin that you think would stop him from pressing the button will only do so if they think this is the final act of a mad men having lost control. Not if they believe that NATO is about to conquer Russia and that it will be their end as well.

I also disagree with your stance that the only thing you can do is to start a military conflict with them right now.

It seems like Ukraine is lost (and I am incredibly sad about this) but don't make the mistake that the response this is getting is ""nothing"". This will isolate Russia and cripple their putrid economy even further. Putin is not a magician. You need money and ressources to fight wars. Especially if you are forced into a bloody occupation like this might turn out to be if the Ukrainians don't just lay down and take it. Putin is not immune to this. Even if he conquers the Baltics or Poland and NATO actually is so cowardly to not respond with military forces, odds are he wouldn't be able to hold it for all too long and would ultimately lead to his downfall ultimately.

Don't really understand your colonialism statement.

I mean the US arguably did something like that in Vietnam and especially Iraq (what WMDs? ) and nobody could do anything to stop it even if they wanted to. But as the US has seen, that does not mean that you won't ultimately regret it badly.

&#x200B;

I think its both actually. There are reports out there that Putin had a complete freakout over what happened to Gaddafi and ultimately the biggest threat to him are his own people getting the wrong ideas about freedom or democracy or what a life might look without him. Thats why he can't allow Ukraine to prosper in his backyard given the similarities between the Russians and Ukrainians. 

That he had ambitions to restore the greatness of the Soviet Union where he was a former KGB officer is obviously always something that was well known.
