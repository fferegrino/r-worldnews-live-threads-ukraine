If you just disconnect all the power, that water starts boiling, and eventually boils off completely. The nuclear fuel is stored inside some other materials that keep it from going critical, but they're not meant to handle the high heat without the water around them keeping them cool. The whole thing can catch fire, which would release radioactive smoke, similar to what happened at chernobyl.

There are usually back-up generators to keep the water flowing and cool, but those run on fuel, and won't run forever.

Before we go down the OMG WE'RE ALL DOOMED route, let's calm it down a bit with the reactor.

It is shut down. The fuel that is inside the facility is going to be giving off minimal amounts of waste heat. As long as the cooling pools that the fuel is resting in are not destroyed, they will be fine.

The actual reactor itself is underneath a very strong concrete/steel containment structure and is an extremely strong piece of pressure-rated steel. It will take a LOT of concentrated shelling and mortaring to break through the structure. Even if the reactor contains fuel, having been shut down for maintenance will lower the decay heat of the fuel to a low enough level that it may be able to be cooled via passive water circulation. US navy reactors actually use this as a mode of operation, as no pumps = silent running.

Long story short. The plant is tough. It will be safe UNLESS Russia goes out of its way to make it unsafe. At that point, they will be guilty of creating the world's largest dirty bomb.",False,1646359235.0,t3_t67kwg,t3_t67kwg,,0,334,0,334,4,2,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 2}"

Matthew Bunn, the James R. Schlesinger Professor of the Practice of Energy, National Security, and Foreign Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School (and PI of Managing the Atom):

* It appears that Russian forces are shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. At least one building at the site is on fire.

* This is shockingly reckless, and a violation of multiple agreements.

* The member states of the [International Atomic Energy Agency] unanimously agreed years ago that attacking a nuclear power plant “constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency,” as IAEA DG @Rafael Grossi has pointed out.

* This shelling COULD cause a major radioactive release, but it’s too soon to tell whether (a) that will happen, (b) that’s what Russian forces intended, or (c) if it does happen, how big the release will be.

* The most crucial thing for maintaining safety of a nuclear plant is keeping the core cooled.  In the core of a nuclear reactor, and even in its spent fuel pool, there’s a LOT of heat...

* ...even if the reactor has been shut down (it comes from radioactive decay of the fission products).  If it’s not kept continuously cooled, bad things happen, as we saw at Fukushima.

* That cooling requires off-site electricity to run the relevant pumps and so on.  Because sometimes electricity goes down, all nuclear reactors have on-site diesel generators as a backup (and typically batteries that can last for a few hours).

* Shelling could cause  what’s called “station blackout” – if the off-site power goes down, and either the diesel generators don’t work or they run out of fuel.

* Then the reactor’s cooling would fail and the reactor would melt down, and a radioactive release would be quite likely (though the specifics depend on how well the building holds in the steam pressure...

* ...and whether hydrogen released from the reaction of the zirconium fuel cladding with high-temperature steam detonates and causes an explosion that shatters the building, as happened at Fukushima, etc.)

* Shelling could also cause damage to critical cooling systems – pumps, pipes, etc. – but in general the building surrounding the reactor is heavily reinforced concrete, so those systems MAY be adequately protected.

* The spent fuel pool, outside the heavily protected reactor building, is also an issue.

* If IT loses electricity, the water will eventually boil/evaporate away, the fuel would melt and make a nasty mess in the pool, which might NOT lead to a radioactive release, depending on the design of the fuel building.

* If the fuel building was shattered by shelling, then any fission products released from the melted fuel could get out into the surrounding countryside.  Shelling could also cause a water leak that could lead to fuel melting, even if the electricity stayed on.

* IF the fuel pool is really overstuffed with spent fuel , AND the hot fuel assemblies recently discharged from the reactor are stored next to each other (rather than interspersed throughout the pool)...

* ...the fuel can get so hot it catches fire – that, plus a shattering of the building, is really the worst-case scenario. That could release a quantity of radioactivity even worse than Chernobyl, potentially.

* Exactly under what circumstances fire would occur is hotly debated, as there is very little real data on the subject.

* If anyone has good data on the quantity of spent fuel in the pools at Zhaporizhzhia, and the arrangements for preventing fire, I’d [Matthew Bunn] want to see it, as should others.

* Staff are likely to be unable to continue at the plant.  Responsible staff will likely have shut down the reactors at the site by now, but even so, the heat from radioactive decay is is still getting generated,

* the cooling still has to happen – you need knowledgeable operators on-site to keep things safe.  None of these plants are “walk-away safe.” Nevertheless, the main hazard to Ukrainians today is bullets, shells, and bombs, not radiation.",False,1646360515.0,t3_t67kwg,t3_t67kwg,,0,83,0,83,0,0,

Delusional, yes, but at first I thought maybe he truly sees this as righting some historical wrong and trying to bring Ukraine back ""into the fold"", international norms be damned.

But now I don't believe any of that. It's all bollocks meant to sell it to the public who are sympathetic to the cultural ties. Look at his actions. You do not treat your brothers and sisters this way. You do not carpet bomb cities, you do not bomb hospitals and schools and apartments, you do not attack a nuclear power plant and risk a devastating meltdown. He talks out of one side of his mouth that the Ukrainian people all want to be part of Russia and it's supposedly these ""Nazis"" at the top that need to be eliminated. But then he goes on an utterly brutal campaign of killing across **all** of Ukraine.

This isn't about reunification. I think all this comes down to is jealousy. Putin, quite simply, does not like the fact that Ukraine will likely become more successful than Russia, despite being much smaller. He views Ukraine as his property, and the idea that it would adopt Western ways and have an economy that grows faster than his, he just can't stand it. That is why he is using such brutal tactics. He wants to put Ukraine in its place and snuff out their happiness. I am sure that Zelensky infuriates him most of all, because he doesn't understand the bravery and love that Zelensky demonstrates. He does not understand how Zelensky can be such a happy person and smile, even amid his country being invaded. He cannot comprehend any of it, and he wants to put a stop to it. If Russia can't have post-Soviet success, neither can you. I really think it is that simple.

Even with all the modern safeguards and hardening, those safeguards and hardening aren't really designed to account for large scale military bombardment. Things break and fail unpredictably, chaotically.  Fires break out.  Backup systems positioned and designed to account for natural disasters or equipment failures or operator mistakes can be rendered inoperable and incapable of performing their tasks.   Even if the control rods stop the reaction and a meltdown, a large scale fire can waft radioactive material high into the atmosphere.  That won't cause instant death, but it could cause a spike of cancer incidents and birth defects for a wide swath of Eurasia.

Nuclear power plants are heavily protected and difficult to destroy precisely because the consequences of catastrophic accidents are so serious for so many people. 

Battles are innately unpredictable chaotic things. We don't know who has what weapons, We don't know what kind of artillery, fire support or explosives might be in the area, and we don't know what snap decisions are going to be made by relatively junior people under the stress of a firefight. We don't know what state of repair the plant is in, and although there are plenty of experts out there, noone in the world is a going to be able to confidently say that there is zero risk of a major radiation leak  if a randomly selected assortment of systems and structures in a Soviet era nuclear power plant take catastrophic damage. What happens if, say someone shot down a fully laden helicopter gunship at the exact wrong time or if someone a few km away heard decided to fire off a thermobaric rocket  salvo in the direction of the ukrainian defenders. It's not 100% predictable. If it were, Fukushima wouldn't have happened.

For me this is the absolute final straw. 

NATO should tell Russia, today, that any attack or military action within a 5 km radius of any nuclear facility will result in the immediate involvement of NATO troops to secure all such facilities in Ukraine. Hell, if they kick up a fuss about that demand Russia agree to the deployment of Swiss/Swedish or Israeli troops to immediately secure nuclear power plants or Nato comes in.

I’m scared as well but we need to unite as a species and figure out a way to end this peacefully before we wipe ourselves from the history books. 

We need to be able to come out of this stronger, more prepared for a new evolving world, cooperate to further our species so we may further explore the universe, do away with the old energy producing methods and embrace clean alternatives and further their research so they can evolve to help find answers to reversing the damage. Endorse freedom and liberty but most importantly deliver it as promised inclusive of all. Provide the less fortunate with ways to succeed and feed themselves. We need to give future generations a platform to prove themselves and be the spark that lit the fire with which we first created our warmth and safety.

The days of Yuri Orlov and the like.  Even more scary than today in some respects.  Nevertheless and I cant be more emphatic about this, we don't want a return to chaos in Russia. 

The Russian people in and of themselves are good people and we do not need to demonize them.  They have families and aspirations. Its the land of Pushkin, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and culture.

 At the close of the 1990s, and like so many before them, they put their faith in a strongman, and ultimately bargained away their liberties for the false security and lies that he seemingly provided.  Its a story as old as time itself.  But that does not mean that the people themselves are bad.  It just means they got duped, as the US almost was very recently. 

And what caused the chaos 1990s is that the West won the cold war, and rather than actually helping the Russians, we sent over a cadre of Chicago School economists whose advice succeeded only in creating the circumstances  that allowed the rise of the Oligarchs and the kleptocratic regime.  The Russian language film Tycoon captures this moment to a tee, and is a must watch for anyone interested. 

BY NO MEANS am I trying to lessen the tragedy that the people of Ukraine are now facing.  Its merely to make the point that we should not equate the Russian people themselves with the crimes of the regime.

1) nobody disagrees with the statement! Nobody is ""scared"" someone might actually do it!

3) Putin's claims of being provoked by the west etc. appear mostly absurd to much of the world. This makes defending Russia's position less politically tenable.

4) Graham callign for the offing of Putin just legitimizes a lot of what Putin has been saying. Makes it easier to rally behind russia as a victim of western bullying.

cb95236444aed69cdd034daae2a3ecdc,t67kwg,hz9mj99,"Putin said for 10 years, this video from five years ago, and even last week. He wants to balance the power of the west. And he believes The threat of “mutually assured destruction“ was the only way for Russia 
 to regain any leverage. And that he would go to that brink and wants Cold War years to come back to get back that leverage. He is out right threatened World War III He wants to put the process emotions and not go through with it but he believes going through that process will get him a deal. It’s not about Ukraine. And he believes he has some mute weapons technology that was somehow drive us to the bargaining table. Maybe he thinks in his twisted mind that he can provoke us and somehow use these new weapons that will somehow make us come running to bargain with him. But what rational person would make a deal to scale back NATO now? After this? And how can you trust any deal with someone willing in the first week to already start threatening nukes? Which again is his point. Look at North Korea. There’s not much you can do but isolate a country with nukes. Mutually assured destruction is an equalizer. And Putin is absolutely convinced he can somehow get an equalizing deal by doing this. So he’s going all the way. He’s not going to launch a nuclear attack. But he wants to make it seem as if he really would. I believe that’s why he is even trying to look a little bit crazy and disheveled, losing his composure in ways he never has in his life. Because you need to look crazy to threaten nuclear war. Like they said with Trump Dash it might be a good bargaining technique to make a president look unstable because you don’t know what he will do.

https://youtu.be/kqD8lIdIMRo[five years ago threatening nuclear war in order to balance power in a calm manner at an economic forum ](https://youtu.be/kqD8lIdIMRo)

I mean in a perfect world you could dare him to go through with this blast. But in reality when it comes to nukes you can never be 100% sure what will happen so the threat is always a threat.

He can level Ukraine in one day with all of his military mate. This is meant to start out slow and drag out and then escalate and escalate and escalate until he thinks he can get this deal. West is going to need restraint. Because it seems like he wants to provoke something so he can escalate into that nuclear threat. But I have no idea where this is going. But it’s definitely not about Ukraine

It was bringing up World War III for a while now and supposedly has the weapons to do it. Maybe he means he’s able to deliver a nuclear warhead on a hypersonic missile. Which we now know exists because China used one last year. Putin has been bragging he has one for a while now. And we may as well we have been testing them. But the point is Putin has never stated he would actually ever launch the weapon. But he has actually calmly explain that he wants to have a nuclear threat in order to balance out power and regain leverage lost after the Cold War. And then re-creating the Cold War he may try to re-create the Cuban missile crisis. Only my guess would be Venezuela. Remember when they gave him $1 billion in gold in 2019? And he flew it out? What did they get an exchange? And how hard would it be to get a warhead into Venezuela? I mean that is a serious question. I have no idea. But I wouldn’t put it past him and his poisoned mind to think that having some nuclear standoff get that tens will somehow give him a deal and leverage that he lost. It will probably only make him go through the Cold War depression and spiral his country out of control in the end. He’s rational according to his logic. But totally irrational according to mine 

I think this was planned for a while and he knew he would be sanctioned. But I don’t think he knew his economy would for this much. It’s probably why three or four years ago they were buying gold like crazy. They wanted enough gold in their war chest to stave off inflation.

He has also been probing the only Internet cable that connects Europe and America for several years now. So he knows where to cut if we ever do engage in any war. With the cyber attacks I’m sure he has a lot of good Intel. And apparently according to Intel, he’s already hacked the power grid and other infrastructure. 

https://www.wired.com/story/russian-hackers-us-power-grid-attacks/


So he thinks he can disrupt us in our economy and play these games and somehow will be begging him for a deal? Doesn’t make sense as far as the endgame but that’s what he’s been saying. And so far he’s done everything he has said.

https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/russian-submarines-could-be-tampering-undersea-cables-make-internet-work-169587

You can argue he said he wasn’t going to war. But he has still been truthful because he is playing semantics. He’s calling it a military incursion. And he’s even sentencing military to 15 years if they ever call it a war.


He even said Russia was ready for the new Cuban missile crisis

Bet the pool needs power to keep cool, right? Why does all this sound familiar? Well, Fukushima’s nuclear power plant lost power to keep their pools cool and so the spent fuel rods polluted the atmosphere for quite some time as a result.

A lot of safety measures all sound good to hear, but I doubt there is a chapter in the nuclear power plant design specifications for hardening against sustained military bombardment and/or unchallenged deliberate on-site espionage from a sophisticated cyber attacking adversary. Putin and I’m sure a few people involved with the Russian invasion definitely have some screws loose. Regardless, I doubt the safety of the nuclear waste is as highly maintained as the reactor.

Assuming there are sufficient safety measures for the reactor and waste, few people on the planet have actually reviewed the as-builts to see if the nuclear plant actually got built to meet the lofty specifications set for nuclear power plants, evaluated the risk analysis assessments, and also kept tabs on the maintenance reports which underpins the integrity of the whole facility. Let us hear from them, and only them, about how safe this plant is from a military assault.

The response for assaulting a nuclear power plant needs to be significant. A precedence needs to be set. There are nuclear power plants all over the world, and they need to be kept safe.

If he’s just absolutely destroying cities because he knows they can’t take them otherwise, he’s panicking and trying to get any sort of tighter grip on Ukraine. Do we think he’s desperate enough to just destroy the country entirely and then retreat, say by blowing up a nuclear reactor or just bombing the shit out of the country if he’s seeing no other way out? He won’t just surrender and back down, if he’s backing down, he’s making damn sure Ukraine isn’t standing back up. I’ve seen plenty of videos of Russian soldiers complaining about conditions and notably mentioning that Russia has been telling them for days that someone’s coming to bring them back home but no one has shown up. It seems clear Russia knows morale is in the dumps and is doing anything to get them to stick around just a little longer. I genuinely think if countries promised them salvation, Russian soldiers would dip.

The west will courageously pat itself on the back hard enough to break a wrist for sanctions that don’t halt the invasion even an inch right up until it’s popularly realized that it’s too late to do anything meaningful anymore. Then we’ll bicker about what we should have done as Ukraine burns.

There will be a strong insurgency fighting back against splitting up the country into sectors and installing puppet governments that will in some ways resemble the USSR’s foray into Afghanistan.

The world will become even less stable as western weakness is put on display and the global power vacuum grows in intensity. China will see this as an opportunity and take Taiwan within the decade; which will lead to chip shortages as Taiwan won’t leave TSMC to China.

Bet the pool needs power to keep cool, right? Why does all this sound familiar? Well, Fukushima’s nuclear power plant lost power to keep their pools cool and so the spent fuel rods polluted the atmosphere for quite some time as a result.

A lot of safety measures all sound good to hear, but I doubt there is a chapter in the nuclear power plant design specifications for hardening against sustained military bombardment and/or unchallenged deliberate on-site espionage from a sophisticated cyber attacking adversary. Putin and I’m sure a few people involved with the Russian invasion definitely have some screws loose. Regardless, I doubt the safety of the nuclear waste is as highly maintained as the reactor.

Assuming there are sufficient safety measures for the reactor and waste, few people on the planet have actually reviewed the as-builts to see if the nuclear plant actually got built to meet the lofty specifications set for nuclear power plants, evaluated the risk analysis assessments, and also kept tabs on the maintenance reports which underpins the integrity of the whole facility.

 >Crab mentality, also known as crab theory, crabs in a bucket (also barrel, basket, or pot) mentality, or the crab-bucket effect, is a way of thinking best described by the phrase ""if I can't have it, neither can you"". The metaphor is derived from a pattern of behavior noted in crabs when they are trapped in a bucket. While any one crab could easily escape, its efforts will be undermined by others, ensuring the group's collective demise. As such, the crab mentality shares some features in common with a similar phenomenon of human behaviour called tall poppy syndrome.

World War 1.

Germany et al was the bad guy.

Russia et al were the harbingers of freedom, putting the bad guys in their place.

Well guess what?

Russia lost to Germany in March 1918 and gave up around a dozen countries.

Ukraine was one of those countries. Probably the biggest of them all?

So Russia lost their country. To the bad guy. For nothing. For trying to help.

Imagine America giving up Puerto Rico to China. Unthinkable under any war scenario. And Puerto Rico isn't even important.

No more wondering why Putin would want Ukraine back now. All the Russian leaders wanted ""The"" Ukraine back. Putin is just the one really trying to get it back like right now with nukes and stuff.

You can argue whether Ukraine belonged to Russia in <1918 or not.

You can also argue whether any of America belongs to anyone other than the Native Americans who were wiped out by invading American pioneers. A few thousand dead brown people dressed in funny clothing, wearing colorful beads and jewelry? Yeap that's a state now. Repeat that process a few dozen times and you have America. It was just as savage and brutal as Russia conquering Ukraine 20 times over 1000 years. Exactly how invading Russian invaders are wiping out Native Ukrainians.

\>Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of the Cossacks.\[61\] In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian tsar, Alexis; whose acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War.

Technically Ukraine belongs to Russia because in 1654 it was given to Russia by the leader of Ukraine. So there, that settles it once and for all.",1646362242.0,1646360965.0,t3_t67kwg,t1_hz9k6rh,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

There have been notable exceptions like tsunamis or human error in the past (see Chernobyl).  But the international community has largely made nuclear power as safe as it can be for how fission works.  

By nature, the design of a reactor is such that it can withstand forces that make small arms damage seem paltry in comparison.  There are other points of failure but most of those are constantly monitored and procedures controlled with sub-second precision, including emergency shutdowns as a last resort.

What they don’t plan for is heavy weapons like missiles, bombs, incendiary devices, and armor penetrating rounds from tanks.  Yeah a massive bomb dropped directly on a reactor would invalidate any procedures that could be performed.  I would guess that any armed conflict around a reactor would be considered “severe danger”.

I think the “we’re safe” idea comes from the assumption that Russian forces want to capture the plant, not destroy it.  If that is the case, a meltdown is highly unlikely because they won’t be using weapons capable of damaging the reactors.",False,1646359637.0,t3_t67kwg,t1_hz9h57z,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

They're very sturdily built (heavily reinforced concrete, within larger buildings, typically at the bottom of pools of water), that render them very difficult to disrupt.

The Ukrainians are certainly in a position to exaggerate, but even some Ukrainian sources have noted the plant is okay. The fighting also appears to be on outer admin buildings.

I think ""nuclear"" invokes such fear that the news really loves fixating on it, and people on social media can get lots of views.

Honestly the burning is not a huge deal in and among itself, but it is indicative that things are bad, real bad. The fire (from the video) appeared to be the museum and admin building. The control rooms for the reactors would be elsewhere and hardened. All should be hardened to withstand a direct airline crash. The threat is the fire and other destruction causes damage to the safety equipment. There are (at least) three ways this could go badly.


1. Stray shells could damage the retention pools where spent fuel is. If the water drains out of the pools, it would have exposed radioactive material open to the air. The result is a dirty bomb. (Water is a phenomenal absorber of radioactivity. If you're on a boat in one of these ponds, you'd get far, far more radiation from the sun than the radioactive material a few meters below you.)
2. The cooling system could go offline. (This is what happened in 2011 in Japan at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.) Even when the reactors are offline, if they are fueled (all 6 are fueled at this facility) they need to be cooled. If water cannot be pumped in to cool it, the containment structure itself can burn/char. This process causes a buildup of hydrogen gas which then can explode, rupturing the containment vessel like in Japan.
3. A direct hit on a reactor with sufficient force. This would be more like a Chernobyl event as the core would be exposed.

There is no scenario this explodes like a traditional mushroom cloud.

I probably got some details wrong, but I'm confident the high level is correct. Hope this provides some clarity.

However, Russia didn't tell Afghanistan that they would protect them. Didn't make a huge public show of daring him not to do it. Didn't threaten them with sanctions and punishments. 

For the record, I hope sincerely that the West doesn't go any further than they already have. No no fly zone.

But it's starting to feel like in for a penny, in for a pound. The cries for help and atrocities only increase from here. It feels like language of politicians is changing on the matter. Clear direct threats. Shows of force. This is way past Cuban missle crisis. 

Also, a conflict with Russia does not guarantee nuclear war or destruction. It significantly raises the risk, but again, nuclear war everyone loses, so what scenario implores either side to destroy the entire world? There is no way to prevent either side from retaliating. 

So here is hoping that doesn't happen, that US stays on their side of the street, but at the pace of escalation world wide, I won't be surprised should things go that way.

There are political and logistical reasons why no NATO countries are directly interefering, and it's because ordering official troops there to invade is a declaration of war. Most political superpowers that could provide military support are affiliated with NATO or EU. A country from either of those groups declaring war means other countries must also join. **Declaration of War from any superpower or large military nation at this point will begin World War Three because when most countries in the world are in a war, that's a World War.**

You are allowed to be angry. And frustrated. And furious and want our world leaders to do something about it. But if YOU are so personally invested in defending Ukraine, join the Foreign Army that Ukraine has set up and do it yourself as many others voluntarily have. 

I am *hoping* you're not a goddamn bot as you've only been on Reddit for 2 months and your comments are wildly varying but encouraging military aggression is a constant. 

We all want our countries to destroy the bully in the Kremlin. We're not fools. I bet you 20$ if every world leader in Europe right now could flagrantly throw laws, caution and self preservation to the wind, they would order the complete decimation of Russia right this fucking second, because as you said, they *can*. But guess what? The USA had a leader who threw caution to the wind and the entire international community hated him because he was unpredictable, volatile, dangerous, and kept saying shit with no thought or regard to the consequences of them. He was narcissistic and represented himself, NOT the people. The leaders of Nations should represent the PEOPLE. The CHOICES of the people. The SAFETY of their people. The VOICES of their people. And NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH RISKING WORLD WAR 3. You, personally, not feeling ""good about humanity's chances in the long run"" does not fucking matter. Your voice is only one in the voices of millions, and millions are still praying that humanity DOES have a chance to stop this with enough force, determination and volunteering. 

Starting World War 3 WILL have consequences. 

If you are so angry that you can't even fathom those consequences, it's time for you to get off the internet and stop doomscrolling. That's enough. There's nothing you can do. You're a person sitting at a computer or typing at a phone screen, angry, frustrated, feeling trapped and helpless.

We lost that war by the way. And also, I agree that Putin needs to be stopped because I don’t believe he is just going to stop under any circumstances. This is the history of world war 2 repeating itself.

Before the end of 2019 I send this list of links like these ones to a friend in the intelligence community saying this guy is definitely up to something. Buying all the stave off inflation, lining up troops all over the world. Claiming he has these new weapons. Probing through cyber warfare. Probing the worlds Internet cables. Building and showing off these new giant submarines. So I thought around 2020 or 2021 this guy was going to do something. I didn’t necessarily think it would be Ukraine.  I was just getting goosebumps. My grandparents were in the middle of all of this living in Ukraine during World War II. They went through the bomb shelters. They went through refugee camps. They went through and survived the epicenter I was bombing between the Soviets and the Germans. And they were more terrified of the Soviets than the Nazis.

I believe he was planning to do this sooner. 2020 or 2021. He was counting on Trump being an office. Look at the guy he’s praising him even now. And I believe covid derailed his plans. Postponed them. And Trump would have been in office still if not for Covid also. Everything was pointing toward the reelection with a booming economy. And so this all would have been easier under Trump. He got Trump to break our nuclear proliferation deals. Trump broken peace treaties with Iran. And so here we are a couple of years after he want to do it with us and maybe some things aren’t going according to plan. But the plan has been prepared for a long time. And the plan is not simply to just take your crane and go home. He has stayed it over and over and over again. I am looking to lead the world to mutually assured destruction if I don’t get this deal. And I’m willing to initiate World War III, but essentially never push the button, because that mutually assured destruction threat is the only way I can get the leverage of my old Soviet glory days.

 >United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 is a United Nations Security Council resolution adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council on 8 November 2002, offering Iraq under Saddam Hussein ""a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations"" that had been set out in several previous resolutions (Resolutions 660, 661, 678, 686, 687, 688, 707, 715, 986, and 1284). It provided a justification for the subsequent US invasion of Iraq. Resolution 1441 stated that Iraq was in material breach of the ceasefire terms presented under the terms of Resolution 687.

Their site is easy to browse for anyone that speaks English 

Most of the refugees just transit Romania on their way to other EU countries. Based on the interactive map I just linked it's a longer wait to get out of the country than to get in.

The alternative is that we continue the revived Lend-Lease act until Russia cuts Ukraine off from the west and then we wring our hands and say what a tragedy it is while millions of people are killed by a madman.

If that happens, I say we call his bluff. I would rather die fighting than watch a genocide happen (im pretty sure Putin wants to finish what Stalin started with thr Holodomor). At least in that case, we would have done the right thing. I know it's not a comfort to know that we did the right thing when we could have done nothing and been safe, after all, its not our people fighting and dying.

If we're willing to watch another genocide occur,  then why would anyone want to live on this earth anymore? If Hitler had nukes, would we have all just sat back and let the Holocaust happen? I literally cannot fathom the people who would rather let millions of people be murdered by an insane dictator, and not do anything, so they can breathe a sigh of relief that they're safe.

The prospect of nuclear war is terrible, but we could all be hit by a gamma ray burst tomorrow or a vacuum instability event could destroy the local group. Life is uncertain and should be protected. Ironically, sometimes that protection has to come from war and killing.

Putin won't stop with Ukraine. He won't stop with Moldova or Kazakhstan. He'll stop when he has his neo-USSR or someone stops him. Hopefully someone stops him before things get even worse.

All that said, not everyone wants to, or can, fight this war physically. Remember: **Donating financially and materially is helping. Making sure that people understand what Russia is doing and that they pay for their crimes helps. Ensuring that the Russian people know that Putin needs to be stopped and is an absolute walking shitstain of a human being helps.**",False,1646364075.0,t3_t67kwg,t1_hz9msrc,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Someone just merely saying something, you scoffing at it, or just reading it, could cause an incorrect memory later.

 A huge part of information warfare is being able to corroborate and confirm. Anything that doesn't have multiple reputable sources corroborating it should be taken with a grain of salt. Even if it comes from either horses' mouth.

Ultimately, we're not intelligence officials, if we want to stay reasonable, and stay sane, we should only trust what can absolutely be verified, and then just leave the rest of the [Doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) at the door.

I provided some links for you to read if you weren't completely informed on what all of this is, as a lot of people coming around for news aren't attuned to these kinds of playbooks.

Worrying about this will get you nowhere my friend. If it's damaging your mental health and making you unable to function, you can leave. Anyone who tells you that you shouldn't, or can't, or anything otherwise... is just text on the internet, they're an **asshole** plain and simple. I can press F12 and delete it, or I can turn my computer off. If what they said actually does bother me, I emphasize the shut-off as the issue being 'shut off'. Some people can't stomach it and keep it together **and that's fucking fine. There's nothing wrong with that, there's nothing wrong with you, other people are the problem.** But it's on you to cut off the toxicity. I'd start by just deleting Reddit. Closing out the toxic discussion and minimizing your exposure to the bots, trolls, propaganda and everything in-between is the first step.

It helps if you remember that the person on the other end can be a Teenager who hasn't even learned how to wash their face and clean their sheets yet.

**If you actually want Patriotism though**, remember that this Nation is responsible for quite a fucking lot of today's world. From the achievements made at Bell Labs, WW1&2, fucking JAZZ music (look up it's exponential impact on music), to the American Revolution helping to inspire the same bravery for liberty across the world. Hurr durr American inflated self importance aside, we've done a **fucking lot**, but with all of our change comes bad too.

I always say that America's two most valuable exports are Culture and Security. Don't like America's practices? 

Fine, but don't deny our importance. Our inventions are responsible for today's comforts. Our movies, our culture, our music, our influence, sits in your home. And to those from a nation who has been hurt by the West, the US, and all of our involvements. I haven't forgotten you either, you're as equally important.

But today, 300 years later, we stand united with half the world against someone who would send us back into those dark ages we fought so hard to come back from.

We've done bad, we've done good, so has everyone. So has every nation, and every man, woman or child. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. We didn't pick to be born here, but we sure as fuck shouldn't just walk away because we hate it. Everyone before us fought to stay here, to keep their lives free. So should we, for our future, our kids, and if not OUR kids, someone else's.

Give Americans a common enemy, and we're physically, logistically and literally unstoppable, short of Nuclear war, you can't fucking touch us, come across the sea, fight our infantry, our troops, our citizens. 

Try(don't), go ahead. There's a reason we dumped **two trillion** dollars into the F35 and risk international incidents to recover downed ones. It's a fucking beast of a plane.

Does this concept NOT make any sense to you? Do you understand the weight of that choice? Look at me in the eye and tell me that in the event that you were made leader of your nation, you would risk sacrificing your family, your friends, the neighbourhood you grew up in, the cities of people who had no choice in your decision, JUST to protect a country that you likely didn't even THINK about two weeks ago. In story books and legends, yes, you would. But reality is, humans are animals and we are emotional and panicky. We are not as brave and virtuous as we think we are. 

And if you DO make that decision, tell me you will be able to deal with the vitriol, the frustration, the anger of OTHER nations allied with you, hating you for forcing them into war, putting the lives of THEIR people at risk without considering them, because YOU wanted to play Superman and save a poor innocent country from the big bad boogeyman without consulting everyone else. And NOT snap. And STILL play nice with all the other nations. Because there was a leader who didn't give a fuck what everyone else did. His name was Donald Trump and most people who weren't brainwashed Americans or brainwashed Russians hated him.

You are looking at this through the lens of ultimate consequence. I am telling you that there's a reason our world leaders have not declared war, and the fact that you would prefer to encourage war means simply this: **volunteer yourself.** Ukraine has set up a Foreign Military Sector for people like you who want to defend Ukraine and not wait for our leaders to agree to make this call. 

You have zero education or right to declare what is and isn't right for the entire globe, and neither do I. We are idiots doomscrolling news on a war, feeling helpless and wanting this shit to end, hiding behind our computer screens with access to internet, and freedom to say whatever bullshit we want without risk of being arrested for it.

The US Federal government consists of three branches, the executive, legislative and judicial.  The three are supposed to have ""checks and balances"" over each other so none are extraordinarily powerful.  

The executive is lead by the President.  He can't make laws or do much ironically.  His main power is nominating judicial Supreme Court justices, which have to be confirmed by the Senate (part of the legislative).  He also is the Commander in Chief of all armed forces.  He's responsible for enforcing and implementing the laws the legislative body creates.  

The legislative consists of two bodies, the Senate and House of Representatives.  There are 100 senate seats, two from each State.  There are 435 representatives which are based on the populations of the various States.  Being a senator is a more prestigious government position.  

The legislative body is who creates the laws of the US, which may be rejected or signed into law by the President.  

The judicial is lead by the Supreme Court justices, who hold lifetime appointments until they step down.  There are multiple tiers of courts and various districts throughout the nation.  The court system further defines how laws are interpreted and resolves issues of implementation, and they may undo a law for legal reasons.

3. To my point about Call of Duty, younger generations glorify war because we’re so used to it. It’s all we’ve known. I’ve lived through US conflict for most of my life. We’ve become so desensitized to war that conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan stopped making news. We got bored of war because it was a constant. NATO involvement would drag us into absolutely *massive* scales of conflict not seen since World War 2, likely even greater. People who call for NATO involvement seem to have forgotten the effect of war on EVERYONE involved. It’s easy to call for all out war when you forgot what war was. Except, this wouldn’t even be a kind of war that anyone alive has ever had the unfortunate chance to experience. An attack on NATO soil, which Russia would surely attempt with direct Western military action, would be very similar to the early days of WW1 when alliances and pacts yanked countries into conflict over the assassination of a future duke by what was essentially an extremist organization. Simply put, it’s not worth it to NATO to get involved. It sucks for Ukraine, no doubt about it, but it’s not going to happen.

Economic might is PARAMOUNT. So I would like to be aware of the narratives both sides push out. It is an information war, in a battle for hearts and minds out there.

Guys, the main fucking show is still the US and Soviet Union. America needs to control the world order through the international system and institutions to maintain their insatiable need to be on top of the global economy! Capitalism shares the ideology of the cancer cell, it grows for the sake of growing! 

And why wouldn’t Russia and their bloodthirsty oligarchs want to challenge that world order? It’s a big pie and they want their share of influence and economic advantages as well! It’s just that they don’t have the fucking finesse of the west’s Cold War game.   They don’t understand that fear doesn’t motivate people to act like sheep, as much as hope does.

And in this instance, the aggressor is Russia and it needs to pay. But if we consider the legacy of the Cold War and the school of thought that the creation of NATO and the establishment of American hegemony over the international system (Bretton woods, the IMF) can also be perceived as American expansionism for the control of global markets to buy American goods and services, this conflict has shades of the need for America to delegitimize a fellow superpowr’s need for its sphere of influence. It’s hypocritical when America is NUMBER ONE in cultivating a band of loyal nations/economies as chess pieces against Russia/Soviet. 

Now for the war crimes/disproportionate use of force, I am not surprised Russia went that route. They don’t share the same values of the free and open world. But who set these values as the norm in the first place? The noobest part of Russia’s game is they fail to keep up with the times - hope, rather than fear, is what wins you friends. Are hope, freedom, democracy good things? Of course! But what lies beneath this moralistic narrative is the capitalist machinery that demands the continued dominion over the rest of the great powers to the lower rungs in the global value chain. War is great justification to level global punishment onto Russia. The west are clearly winning this war of narratives, and rightfully so. But to paint the Russians as barbaric aggressors? Don’t give them that credit, they just not as good in the game as the west. But ultimately, ordinary citizens and lives get FUCKED. Never forget.

First off, nuclear subs are nuclear reactor powered, they are not necessarily carrying nuclear weapons.

Nuclear reactors don't 'blow up' like a nuclear bomb.  They leak radiation when damaged, along with radioactive materials if damaged enough.

Nuclear weapons don't blow up when damaged, creating a nuclear explosion requires an insanely complex series of events involving extremely precise timing.

People are only pushing that narrative because it drives more people to view tweets, videos and buy newspapers. All that stuff's money really.

You won't ever see a ground war between the US and Russia specifically because of nukes. Putin may be an idiot, but he's not stupid. Everyone knows what the stakes are here, and he's run out of bargaining chips. Usually in diplomacy and geopolitics, you *threaten* the enemy with your supposed capability to try and get the enemy to fold. Remember how North Korea would often test missiles and they'd land in the Pacific Ocean? Well the reason they conducted the test is not just so that they can see how far their missiles can reach, but rather to show *everyone else* how far their missiles go. It's like a dick-wave, showing ""Hey! Look! This is how far our missiles go. So fuck with us, and we'll blow you apart."" 

We know North Korea's military is a joke. We know that the country can barely feed itself, and is on the verge of collapse. But the threat of those missiles keeps the US from invading. We know it's a bluff, but there's no point in calling the bluff, so we just let them be.

Same with Russia in this situation. For the longest time, the Soviets/Russians held the title for the largest and strongest military in the world, backed by the largest amount of nukes by any one country. The Russians bluffed, saying to everyone ""Not only can we steamroll you, but we might not even need to fire a single nuke because we're just *that* strong. Putin used the *supposed* might of his army as his bluff, to make sure that noone messed with them and that they got their way. 

But the thing about bluffing the strength of your military, is that you only *say* you have a good army. You never should *show* the enemy what your army is like, because chances are they're nowhere near as strong as your enemy believes they are.

Case in point: the US lost to Rice farmers(Vietnam) and Mountain goat herders(Afghanistan). The Soviets lost to those same Mountain goat herders when they also invaded Afghanistan before the US did, and now the Russians will lose to a bunch of Ukranians. Putin has lost a bunch of geopolitical bargaining, because now everyone knows what a sad state the military is, and with the new sanctions, we also see how shit their economy has become. I'm willing to bet that there will be a major restructuring within Putin's political leadership, if not the outright removal of him as leader. 

And lastly, just know that we've already been way *way* ***way*** closer to nuclear war than we are now. The Cuban Missile Crisis is already well known, but there's also two events in 1983 that almost saw us end each other.

In 1983, NATO began a series of training drills known as Able Archer 83. The drill saw NATO deploy over 23,000 soldiers to the Soviet border, along with thousands of aircraft, warships, nuclear-capable missiles armed and prepped for launch. The Soviets phoned up the US and asked ""Hey what the fuck are you guys doing?"" and the US said ""Oh it's just some training drills"". Naturally the Soviets didn't believe them, so they said ""Stop this now or we're gonna fucking nuke you all"".

TL;DR. There legitimately is a very low chance that we're going to die in WW3. Anyone trying to tell you otherwise is just trying to fear monger. If it keeps stressing you out, I recommend just blocking any media news sites and just looking at kittens.
