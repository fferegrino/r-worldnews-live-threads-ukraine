Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 22 March 2023.  


* Over recent days Ukrainian forces initiated a local counterattack to the west of the Donetsk Oblast town of Bakhmut, which is likely to relieve pressure on the threatened H-32 supply route.  

* Fighting continues around the town centre and the Ukrainian defence remains at risk from envelopment from the north and south.  

* However, there is a realistic possibility that the Russian assault on the town is losing the limited momentum it had obtained, partially because some Russian MoD units have been reallocated to other sectors.

Chronology 

The first explosion was heard at about 4.30 and was not very loud. 

At 4:46 a strong roar was heard in the central region of Sevastopol. From the shock wave in the apartments, windows and doors trembled, cars howled. At the same time, Sevastopol residents note that at the moment they do not see any smoke, they do not hear any sirens of special vehicles. 

Three such explosions were heard with an interval of 10-15 minutes. 

5:44 - A new explosion sound is reported. 

5:53 - Sevastopol residents say that automatic bursts are heard in the city. It is believed that there is shooting at the UAV. 

6:00 - shots and roar are still regularly heard in the sea bay. Sevastopol residents report that ships of the Black Sea Fleet are operating in the waters. 
Smoke is nowhere to be seen above the city. 

6:13 - the city is noisy again. It is reported about the active work of air defense. 

6:23 - Sevastopol residents report that they see strange lights at the entrance to the bay, presumably, a naval UAV was shot down.

And while there probably are still more modern tanks in stock and also in repair/revision, and certainly a number of more modern tanks will be in active duty currently, and there is of course some number that will be produced new, it does appear their stocks are nearing their end.

If that is the case, then it would appear Putin's strategy of prolonging the war to exhaust Western patience has failed.

The US should not make the same mistakes with Xi that it made with Putin. Xi and his gang are self-interested and couldn't care less about Putin or this supposed friendship. They respect strength and will advance if faced by weakness in Ukraine and elsewhere.

*Today, some Ukrainian troops (that were operating in the Orikhiv area) entered the village of Novodanilovka—a town which is just south of Orikhiv and in the gray zone.  There weren't any Russian units there.*

*At the moment, the Armed Forces of Ukraine control half of Novodanilovka and they’re digging in. Their attacks on Russian positions are expected to resume in the next couple of days.*

*FPV Drones are deployed along the front of the Orikhiv-Polohi line. In addition, there is an accumulation of Western-made heavy armored vehicles near Orikhiv. According to some reports, the Ukrainian command is intending to use a large number of different UAVs, simultaneously, in order to overload Russian air defense.

Kharkiv was a total disorganized rout, and Kherson was unbelievably well performed, in my opinion the best display of command by the Russians in the whole war (not saying much). It was a retreat under fire and across a wide contested river with no usable infrastructure and they barely left any equipment and personnel behind. 

As pathetic as their strategy has been this whole war, it’s still never a good idea to underestimate your enemy. One of the best (for Ukraine) strategic turns since the return of Kherson has been the demotion of Surovikin, as he seemed to be the only person in the Russian ministry of defense to have any tactical sense.

Obviously though, the cope is that “Ukraine didn’t succeed in Kherson”. By all accounts, Ukraine’s Kherson offensive brought a smile to Sun-Tzu’s skeleton, they fought Russia on their own terms, and took back the city itself without having to resort to block by block urban fighting.

I've tried for awhile to come up with a way to illustrate this point, and I think now may be the time to do so.

This went all the way into the Obama administration (Hence our reaction's to the Georgian and Crimea situation).  For the Atlantic to come out and state they agree with DeSantis on this policy isn't a matter of supporting the GOP all the sudden, its more so them leaning on previous political foreign policy strategy.  In all reality DeSantis is quoting realism is a matter of convenience, especially given the Trumper's infighting with the Neocon's.  Again, you have to remember that for the past four decades the GOP has always been about heavy military intervention regardless of world powers impact (A very anti Realist approach), where as the left has wanted to maintain the delicate balance.

We very well could be seeing the Left and Right flip flop this decade on Foreign policy approaches of old, so it may not be surprising for some left leaning organizations to still hold onto that, IMHO, terrible foreign policy strategy.",1679510513.0,1679510234.0,t3_11y69ax,t1_jd911lq,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Well that’s kind of what artillery is for. And other tanks, IFVs, Javelins, TOWs. The T-55 is ass.

I think we can still laugh because the vaunted Russian armored corps (second army in the world btw) has lost so many of their mighty MBTs that they are down to using post-WW2 shitboxes. And they are going to be way less dangerous than still being able to field replacement T-72B3s, T-80BVMs or T-90Ms. Same as the Mosin example above, it can still fill the role in some capacity but overall capability is significantly lowered.

It is very difficult for either side to do this, and it is primarily a result of better intelligence and better longer range weapons.

And if you've got a vehicle column that does advance when the artillery has them spotted, you get vuhledar.

If they were to face off in a tank duel again in Ukraine, could the T-55 do any damage? Depends on where they hit. Hitting an Abrams or Challenger from the front, no. In the Gulf War, an Abrams was hit in the front with a 120mm DU shell (friendly fire) and there was no internal damage. T-55 rocks a 105mm. Ain’t no way.

Western optics and sensors are absurd. A Chally 2 killed an Iraqi tank from *2.9 miles (4700m) away.* Even the best Russian thermal optics (Sosna U) relies on Western components.

The man was accused of deliberately wearing the shirt, meaning to express his consent to the crimes committed in relation to the Russian aggression, punishable under § 140 StGB. All of those aspects have to be proven by the court. Higher courts already had to render judgements in more severe cases (for example: OLG Hamburg Beschl. v. 31.1.2023 – 5 Ws 5-6/23). 

§ 140 does only apply for a very limited amount of crimes, including few punishable under international criminal law. It's not about ""just"" wearing a shirt. It's about wearing a shirt in order to show sympathy to the crimes, in a way to disturb public peace.

If people are okay with a bit of nuance I think it was mistake for Biden and the Dems to not go higher in terms of support while they had the majority. A 50 or 60 billion dollar bill could probably have been passed especially since McConnel wasn’t anti Ukraine and when Pelosi was still speaker.

I do know that many House Republicans and Senate Republicans do support Ukraine and would normally vote for more funding but if anti Ukraine support becomes the default stance by the nominee that may be impossible. Still Congress has sometimes been known to quietly pass things that might otherwise be unpopular without many people noticing. If House Republicans allow more Ukraine aid to quietly slip into an otherwise popular omnibus spending bill and Trump doesn’t make it a center piece of his attacks then I do think we could see another significant aid package. Even if more drawdown doesn’t pass there is still lend-lease and other forms of US aid but I don’t want to rely on those.",False,1679513267.0,t3_11y69ax,t1_jd94axi,,2,9,0,9,0,0,

To the extent that nation states have pragmatic interests, can you really separate those interests from an underlying ideology which guides them?  I would argue that no, you cannot.

What are they basing that on? Most senior Republicans still support aid as do the majority of Republican voters the last survey I saw a couple months ago. Yes over a year into the war support for military aid to Ukraine has softened somewhat but that is true no matter what your political ideology.

Sure it could shift more over time but most senior and rank and file Republican politicians support and vote for aid to Ukraine, most of the people that vote for them support it and their donors in the military industrial complex definitely support it. I think the idea the Republicans are going to start letting that money go to Democrats is ridiculous, they're much more likely to keep their views aligned with a major campaign funder which is exactly what we see happening so far.

Its dangerous in its own right and it also prevents local commanders from growing too powerful (because the top-level commanders in Moscow get the credit, rather than the frontline soldiers).

First, it enters our minds in the true state. Then it is tested and marked as false as required. If a person is bombarded with a fast flow of information it can basically short-circuit that process and leave the lie in the true state.

Inside? Maybe not, but if you assume Lawton/Fort Sill as a single moderately sized town with a military base as part of it then you can find wonderful food like Red Pepper, which is a whole in the wall mix of Asian cuisine, and Mutti's, which is as close to authentic German cooking as you're likely to find in the central United States. If Indian food is more your jam then Chef India at the very least tastes like authentic Indian food. It's probably the best food in this region, at least in my opinion.

You've got options. They might not be plentiful but they exist.

I didn't read this until after I wrote that. Honestly, they're probably not allowed to leave for their own safety.

Edit: on second thought, you probably overdid it a little. What separates a good troll from the best is a little subtlety. Try it out, you'll have redditors going nuts at you.",False,1679513178.0,t3_11y69ax,t1_jd99no8,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Some more tips: be more subtle. Once you give yourself away as a troll, people don't take you seriously. You need to sound genuine and civil just enough to trick them into thinking they are having a serious conversation, but inflammatory and provocative enough to really get their jimmies rustled. 

Also, if you really want to rustle jimmies, primary school insults might seem like low hanging fruit but you'll just come across as a bit of a clown. Read up on some fallacies like the strawman - that's a really good one. Don't be too obvious with it, though. Really use semantics to twist their arguments just enough to come to wildly different conclusions. That works really well on redditors who are actually intelligent too - nothing grates them more than having to abandon their own argument to tell you why yours is wrong! 

You'll get there mate. Keep living the dream! I'll keep an eye out for you and watch your trolly career with great interest!",False,1679520046.0,t3_11y69ax,t1_jd9equw,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
