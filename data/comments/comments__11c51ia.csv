According to BYPOL, the front and center parts of the aircraft, avionics and radar antenna were damaged. 


“The damage is serious, the aircraft is definitely not flying anywhere anymore. The accident occurred while snowplows were working near the aircraft. [...] Belarusian partisans are consistent in expelling fascists from their land,” BYPOL writes.


Thus, BYPOL confirmed and significantly supplemented the information previously published by the Belarusian Hajun that A-50 aircraft was damaged.

>This weekend the MP for Norwich South, Clive Lewis, a former territorial army officer and shadow defence secretary under Corbyn, questioned why the MoD was selling used Apache helicopters on the open market rather than giving them to the Ukrainians “in their hour of need”...

>She recently wrote: “To support arming Ukraine isn’t to oppose the idea of peace talks. The question is what position Ukraine would enter them from. It’s right to avoid escalation into a direct conflict between Moscow and Nato. However, arming the resistance is a way to allow Ukraine to negotiate from a position of strength, not surrender...”

>...[Lewis'] intervention comes days after John McDonnell, former shadow chancellor and a close political ally of Corbyn, also wrote in support of arming Ukraine, arguing that while he respected the pacifist position, he felt it would not deliver peace but rather risk defeat for Kyiv by Vladimir Putin’s forces.

Day 367-368 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a pretty quiet day, nothing much happened other than a couple of air raid alerts. Today there were still no missile strikes, but a couple of hours ago Russians started launching a bunch of drones at our cities, some of which may have been recon drones, but mostly Shaheds. Sometimes those drone attacks are followed by a big missile strike, so there’s a chance there will be one tomorrow.

They are still launching those drones even right now, and it’s already 4am. At least a couple of drones were intercepted near Kyiv, there was also an explosion reported in Khmelnytskyi, but we are not sure what it was yet, could have just been the sound of our air defense intercepting something. And also about 30 minutes ago there was yet another drone intercepted, but this time near Kharkiv, they are trying to hit many cities at once, but so far it doesn’t seem to work.

The rumors about the explosion in Belarus destroying one of the Russian AWACS planes would be amazing if they turn out to be true. They don’t have many of these planes and if it is destroyed, then there’s a chance that they will delay their next massive missile strike for at least a couple of days.

By militarily “cooperating” with Belarus, it gave Russia an excuse to flood the country with soldiers. They’re effectively soft occupying Belarus, and my money is on them never leaving. Lukashenko has either willingly sold his country off, or is completely brain dead.

If Ukraine had fallen early in the war, the Kremlin would have moved on officially annexing the country (+ Moldova), swallowing up Belarus shortly after. With Hungary then on their direct border, and effectively a USSR mole within NATO, European security would have been completely undermined.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y057YoXtP9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y057YoXtP9I)

It's a few days old, but I just came across it now and found it excellent. I don't normally appreciate *Conflict Zone*'s confrontational interviewing style, but Goncharenko handled it masterfully and gave compelling answers to all questions. A few quotes:

[3:06] On the subject of red lines in the minds of Western leaders:
> The main red line is that many people here want Ukraine to win the war, but at the same time they're afraid of Russia.

[3:43] On the subject of cluster munitions:
> They're using it against us every day. [...] We have all moral right to use it because we're defending ourselves [...] and we're not signatories [to the convention] so we have a juridical right. [...] I think when you're saying this, you just don't realize that every day Ukrainians are killed by Russians on our own soil and in our own homes. How controversial can it be?

[6:30] On the subject of Western fears:
> It's not about Russian escalation. There is a fear that Russian defeat on the battlefield will lead to a collapse of the Russian Federation and then there will be many challenges. [...] The problem is that today's challenge is bigger: a live Russian empire is more dangerous than what will be after the collapse.

[8:36] On China's peace proposal:
> We're interested in all peace proposals, we're ready for negotiations, but what should the subject be? If it's about Russia leaving Ukrainian territory: we're very interested, we're ready, we're eager to go ahead. If it's about concessions from Ukrainian side: that's not the kind of negotiations we're interested in, because it will mean that the international order is still violated. [...] If one inch of Ukrainian territory will be taken by Russia, it will mean that countries can move borders by force.

[13:43] On General Mark Milley's prediction of a stalemate:
> One year ago, the same people in the Pentagon said that Ukraine will fall in 3 days. [...] They were wrong one year ago, why should we be sure they're not wrong today?

[15:27] On the wider global implications:
> Tyrants are geopolitical maniacs: they won't stop, they can only be stopped. And if Putin could be successful in any way, it would send a message to other dictators and tyrants in the world that they can attack.

> Thirty years ago, Ukraine was the first country in human history which voluntarily gave up nuclear weapons. [...] What would be the message to the world, if after Ukraine gave up nuclear weaponry our territorial integrity would not be restored? That will mean one thing to all countries in the world: ""go nukes!"" You should become nuclear powers if you want to have security, because nobody will help you. [...] This war is a crucial moment in the first half of the 21st century. That's something we need to explain to people.

[18:27] On past mistakes:
> If the free world had stopped it in 2014, 2022 would never have happened. [...] Putin felt emboldened, and that was a huge mistake.

[25:00] On the political future of Ukraine
> Because we're a democracy, and Russia showed this to us: political battles are the only way to prevent physical battles on the frontline. [...] [Zelenskyy] bears his responsibilities with dignity, he's been a great commander-in-chief since Feb 24, but I have many questions for him about how we got to Feb 24.

Federal Defense Minister Pistorius hinted at this in the evening on the ARD program “Report from Berlin”.  He does not want to confirm this now, but there are corresponding considerations, according to the SPD politician.  According to Pistorius, such a maneuver would be a ""very clear"" signal to the NATO alliance, but also to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  This shows the Russian President: ""This NATO is by no means as weak as he thought,"" said Pistorius.  The exercise could be held in Poland.  It is also important for the countries on NATO's eastern flank to see that Germany and the USA stand by their commitment to alliance defense, said Pistorius.

This is interesting as in that map it does not fully show that Yahidne has been fully overrun & taken, contrary to earlier todays reports. Granted the only proof of that was a photo of Wagner units by the sign of the village, which would only speculate they reached the very outskirts/entrance point to the village.

His recent speech had a lot of rhetoric designed for Western pro-Putin audiences and made me wonder if we haven't moved into *a new phase* of Russian propaganda operations, to try to break Western resolve by appealing to pacifism.

Consider that many analysts are saying that Russia's expected offensive is already happening  and is failing, and that Russia may be on the defensive for the next while, with a Ukrainian offensive expected in the Spring.

Consider also the conspicuous recent right-wing flurry in the US denying that the war is even happening. And the pacifist protests in some European capitals organised by Russia-aligned agencies. 

Attempts to condition people to seeing the war as over may precede efforts to paint Ukrainian forces as the bad guys for attacking and retaking territory in the months to come. To recast Ukraine as the aggressors.

We may start hearing things like:

>""Ukrainians are invading Russian territory, these places voted to be part of Russia.""  
>  
>""Why is NATO funding an aggressive war to kill people who want to be Russian.""

And thus Putin can continue the war, in a defensive posture for years, if need be, and if the West tires or turns away, Russia could potentially renew offensives to capture the rest of the oblasts they've annexed - or more.

You want an air-force so that you can clear out the skies of fighter aircraft so that you can use ground-attack aircraft. You want ground-attack aircraft so that troops on the ground can call in precision air-strikes on ground targets. It’s the precision strike capability that is the whole point.



I’ve been seeing those videos of Excalibur rounds hitting within a few feet of their target on their first shot. Provided you have an artillery system set up within range, and provided they have a supply of precision-guided shells, there isn’t a functional difference with having a whole air force over-head.



The range is obviously a big difference. A single artillery system can only support a small area compared to what an F-16 can cover. That makes it more difficult to cover a wide area, but for a small area? I’d think that it’s advantage precision artillery. It’s not realistic to ever have 50 jets covering one small area of front. But 50 artillery guns is doable. 




I understand that Excalibur rounds have been in fairly short supply. But imagine if that has changed? We’ve seen them used to very good effect on the defensive. But I don’t think that anybody has ever seen what they could do concentrated on a smaller area supporting an offensive. 



All they need are targets. And that’s why the emphasis has been on supplying Ukraine Bradley’s, I think. Bradley’s are specialized target-acquiring machines. Between drones spotting targets, Bradley’s spotting targets, people spotting targets, and precision artillery concentrated behind them… it’s like having combat air-support that can loiter indefinitely, doesn’t run out of fuel, never has to go back to base. Even the tanks that are coming, they would probably just assume not have them actually shoot if they didn’t have to. Let them use their target-acquisition technology, and then call in an Excalibur round, unless the extra 15 seconds is critical. 



When Ukraine goes on the offensive, I think that we will see some brand-new war-fighting methods. I might be wrong about the artillery. I’m assuming that manufacturing of them got ramped up substantially but hasn’t been talked about. But war-fighting is definitely changing, a lot of conventional wisdom isn’t so wise any more, and I have zero doubts that the Ukrainian military has some new tricks up their sleeves.",1677432424.0,1677431743.0,t3_11c51ia,t3_11c51ia,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

It's a gross obfuscation and simplification of history boiled down to that phrase, but that's what he's going for. 

Furthermore, it echoes with people who were colonized by European powers, especially British/English, around the world. It's why Africa, South Asia and some in South America have been shifting some of their rhetoric. 

Moreover, it also tracts with the frustrations the world has at seeing the U.S., where I'm from, fuck up internationally the last decades with our own military engagements, whether some were for good reasons or not. 

The messiness of Iraq, what happened with the Arab Spring, what happened after Libya was abandoned following the successful campaign against Gaddhafi, what's happening with Afghanistan, and the seemingly blind eye turned to other tragedies/genocides around the world has led to discontent with people the world over who are not from Europe or advanced economies in Asia and the South Pacific. 

I'm not here to litigate these issues, but it's more of what I've been reading in the news around the world the last decade. It has certainly, seemingly become more of an issue as the war drags on and the sanctions have an impact felt across the developing and underdeveloped nations of the world that are not part of the Western alliances. The Russian/Chinese propaganda machine has been in overdrive in these places to put the blame on Western sanctions, instead of the target of those sanctions who started the situation, as well as the narrative that Russia *had* to do it, because the West, as it has been doing for decades now (re: wars in M.E. and Asia by the West just this century), has been continuously encroaching on not just Russia's, but others' sovereignty, and feels they know best in the world, while never facing their own justice for their own actions during these recent conflicts.

Basically, a big ol' ""what-about-ism"" going on that is being effectively pushed on the non-aligned, marginalized nations (many of which have semi 'strongmen' leaders) of the world by China and Russia, as they have been seeking to detach the world and shift them to their POV of how geopolitics in the world should work going back to at least George W.

Second, Russia has still not got over the Mongolian invasion and defeat of Kievan Rus in the 13'th century - the echoes of which dominate Russia's social and political structure.  

Third, Russia is resource rich, and conveniently close to Europe.  With Russia and Europe in a trade relationship, simple economics, deep mutual mistrust, and the cost of transportation mean that in the world of 2020, China cannot access Russia's resources except at a premium.

Against the backdrop of these facts, imagine a future in which Russia is estranged from everyone, and its resources are pariah to western economies? Then Russia either gets over its enmity with China, or starves.  Either way, China's interests are served by isolating Russia.  

A defeated Russia is a Russia that can be brought back into the European fold (because economics will force that in the end), subject to reparations, straps, caveats, etc... in short, resources at a discount.  A Russia at war cannot.  

It is therefore in China's interest that Russia is not swiftly defeated, that the conflict is prolonged, and that Europe and US turn their backs on Russia for the duration.  

Meanwhile, starved of capacity to continue the conflict by sanctions, Russia can be forced to build trade capacity (e.g. ports/terminals/pipelines) with China as the price of getting shells and tanks.   These are not agreements that take a few months to make, they take years.

Mech infantry, artillery, air.   

Air destroys artillery, and Russian doctrine is all about artillery.   Presto, the straight linear thinking is that Ukraine needs aviation.  But this is not strictly true.  Russian artillery sucks when it comes to accuracy, and instead relies on sheer overwhelming volume. 

But volume of artillery means a volume of shells.  Russian artillery without a lot of shells is about as useful as an udder on a bull.  

Furthermore, it's not just about having tons or thousands of shells.   If the shells aren't where the artillery is, when the artillery needs to drink them, for as long as the artillery is thirsty, Russia's at risk of sucking from udders on bulls. 

And this is Russia's major strategic weakness.  Firstly, it is folly to stock more than a few hours of artillery in one place.  If you put too many eggs in one basket, your enemy can lob a single egg and clear out your basket.   You need depots safely out of harm's way.  

Harms way is now a long long way.  85 kms is a few hours over crappy roads.   150 kms is an eternity - particularly when you consider the time it takes to load and unload, and the risk of being intercepted (particularly during unloading).  And the time it takes to give the go-ahead to start the truck on its way.  Because once it's on its way to Point A, you can't use that ammunition at Point B.

Russia needs to be sending ammunition from depots hours (up to perhaps even a day) before it's needed, or it won't arrive safely and in time.  

You don't need to pound artillery with aviation, or risk getting shot from the sky if you can whipsaw the logistics chain to starve a front-line location of artillery.  If the artillery starves, the line collapses.  With sufficient mech infantry, and a thousand kms of front on which  attack, that delay in the decision loop can be exploited. Without exposing precious aircraft and (even more precious) pilots.

Instead, what you need is airlift, because once you break a line you need to get a lot of mechanized infantry across the breach, as fast as possible and into the rear supply lines.  And then you'll see Russia's front unzip.   I suspect it won't matter where the line is breached, but that wherever it breaches, entire sections of front will unzip.",False,1677429523.0,t3_11c51ia,t1_ja3dx98,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,11c51ia,ja4pv00,"Reality: F16s are sexy.  Try to name a model of airplane that has better aesthetic appeal.  It is like trying to argue that cotton t-shirts are more practical for outdoor farm work than a silk camisole. 

For USA their are practical matters of supply.  It is very likely that soldiers operating an M777 will be using a shell that was airlifted to an airbase.  Now the army has to defend the road that leads from the airbase to the howitzer.  Pounding the ground with explosives from the air has a type of efficiency.  Whether it is better or not should not be judged by only the last step.  

For Ukraine they are using NATO ammunition.  The amount of ammunition that can be used is limited by the amount of ammunition that exists.  Because NATO has air forces the NATO countries have stockpiles of aircraft bombs and industries that manufacture air to ground bombs and missiles.  Even if Excaliburs were the best for Ukraine Ukraine probably would appreciate getting twice as many.  Even if the alternative platform is only half as useful getting that added on is still a 50% increase in what Ukraine gets.  

We can look at thermodynamics.  People often do not like thermodynamics but it will never go away regardless of how you feel about it.  You can compare the effectiveness of guns (howitzers) and mortars.  For a given mass of ammunition a mortar will deliver much more explosive than the howitzer.  A very rounded rule of thumb for 3 tons of ammo the guns deliver 1 ton of shell and the mortar delivers 2.  This comparison does not work for rockets because you can have any size (within reason) of rocket motor and any size of warhead.  However, the general trend is the same. The designer can trade range and warhead mass.  You can scrap the warhead completely and launch another missile.  This is how we get things into space.  Rockets have a delta-v and a mass ratio.  This is governed by the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.  A turbofan jet engine does extremely well compared to rockets because they do not have to haul air with them.  The plane carries only the aviation fuel but both a rocket and artillery need a mixed propellant.  

IMO the Excalibre round should be considered a two stage device.  First tube artillery and then guided rocket.  The competition should be a long range air to ground munition.  You could toss them out of any airplane.  The B-52 plus Tomahawk for example.  I am not sure why you cannot simply roll a small diameter bomb out the back of a C130.  Or for that matter why you cannot strap a SDB to a Cessna and have the pilot cut the strap with scissors.  

Air Forces like to have air superiority and do not usually like the suggestion of hauling ordinance being their only purpose.  They like to shoot down other airplanes.  In that context the F16 made sense.  It was already going to be up their dominating the airspace so that engine might as well haul ordinance too.

However, the reasoning for Russia being the guilty party is as following:

- Nordstream was not going to be used anyway. It was a stranded asset so blowing it up was not a loss for Russia.
- Attacking EU energy infrastructure sent a clear signal that Russia is willing to escalate in unconventional ways. It is a display of escalation and brinkmanship, a shot across the bow so to speak.
- A large attack on civilian EU objects creates fear and unrest among the civilian population. Russia's goal is to outlast NATO in Ukraine, which is more likely if the civilian population in Europe stops supporting the war out of fear.
- The risk for any NATO/EU nation to unilaterally attack the Nordstream would be enormous. They would lose all standing and trust among allies and it would significantly weaken the NATO alliance if found out. The same is true for a smaller subset of NATO/EU countries acting independently from the rest. Anyone not in the plot would lose all trust in the ones who were. The potential fallout would be orders of magnitude larger than any type of derived benefit.
- The likelihood of a conspiracy and agreement among all NATO/EU countries is close to zero. Finding consensus for such a move would be nearly impossible, and keeping it secret would be even less likely.

counterattack near the village of Krasne. Contrary to previous  
information, there is no retreat from eastern Bakhmut, only AU counterattack  
there. It's getting really  
interesting. Additional UA reserves  
are to enter the action

forces here a few days ago and have reserves  
What the AU forces north of Bakhmut are doing right now is very risky and

They have a scheduled daily report that may already be outdated, so who knows. But a couple minutes ago their report was that one of the last lines of defense got breeched to the north of Bakhmut. This caused a cascading failure of other northern lines which basically leaves the Russians with a clear shot at the last highway out of Bakhmut. And that basically the only thing holding back the advancing Russians right now is a dam the Ukrainians blew up earlier and shitty weather conditions. But the gist of the report was that the shitty weather is now also a problem for Ukraine who may need to GTFO of Bakhmut, like within the next few days from the sound of it.

That said, the vast majority of Ukrainian forces in the region are outside and to the west. So they could theoretically bring those to bear to smash the front, cause chaos, and make some more breathing room. But would that be in their best interest? And also, wouldn't the weather conditions really interfere with the effectiveness of any combined arms maneuver? At the same time, I could see the counter-attack attempted if they felt the Russians might genuinely clamp down from the north and block in a few thousands Ukrainian troops still in Bakhmut.

This is dumb.

The EU did just fine without ""the potential Ukrane has to offer"" before the war and will do fine after the war ends.

The EU is not after Ukraine's resources, the EU is helping Ukraine for various reasons, most important one being that it's the right thing.

Ukraine doesn't deserve a spot in the EU or NATO just because of the war.

Like every other country, it has to reform itself, it has to do a lot of work in order to integrate in these structures.

That's corruption.

Ukraine is not perfect just because it has been attacked by Ruzzia, and a lot of people here forget that. There will be many years after the war is ended before Ukraine is anywhere close to integrating in the EU/NATO structures, may be decades until that happens.

Let's not jump the horse, let's be realistic here.

Also, from a strategic perspective, regardless of the results of the war, Ruzzia is always going to have a bone to pick with Ukraine. And that is stress the EU and NATO aren't looking too fondly towards, it will make these structures unstable.

It would not be surprising to see the US government spend a fortune inside USA training pilots.  Lots of defense contracts for the aviation companies that make planes, targets, and missiles.  Plenty of contracts for support of both the trainers and trainees.  

Meanwhile in Ukraine the economy collapses.  People need basic necessities.  You pay rent or maintain a property.  You need clothes.  You need tools and transportation to work.

Ukrainians who opposed the invasion and are/were willing to make sacrifices.  But some will reach the limits of how much they are willing to sacrifice.  There are also likely Ukrainian soldiers and supporters who sacrificed their lives and/or resources but were never really loyal to the nation.

F16 doesn't need anything to shoot its gun. Just point the gun, bang, the things over there are dead. That's the advantage of direct fire. The pilot sees the thing he wants to shoot, and shoots it. Ditto with the bombs and missiles the F16 holds, as soon as the pilot decides to shoot, the bombs are dropped or the missiles are going.

Excalibur rounds / artillery (and mortar and other systems) are indirect fire. The operator cannot see the target its shooting at. Due to the incredible range that artillery acts in, there's an incredible delay from shots to landing.

-----------

This is also what a M2 Bradley or M1 Abrams is supposed to do btw, except just from the ground rather than the air. Airplanes are faster, higher (ultimate ""high ground"" advantage, seeing most of the battlefield), etc. etc. But they're far more expensive.

I think M2 Bradley / M1 Abrams and other tank / IFV platforms are the more logical step forward for providing front-line direct fire support. Air support (F16 and the like) are great, but the ground battle is more important.

While their force projection in those first days doesn’t come close to USA in iraq, it did seem genuinely threatening, it was a 4 axis combined arms assault and they were going for the head of the snake (Zelenskyy and Kyiv). When I spoke with my brother on invasion day, I said wow for them to do this, it has to be clean, they have to know it would be clean. 

They blew their early lead, the invasion wasn’t planned out in any depth besides 3 day take over, the shift in momentum in favor of Ukraine was clear, any semblance of moral authority was shattered with war crimes against civilians, commanders have been repeatedly replaced with no concrete gains to show for it, and it’s been nothing but downhill since. Maybe Putin needed another 6 months of planning in secret to pull it off, maybe the usa blew his cover and he felt he had to go now if he was going to go. Now they are running on fumes while Ukraine is getting stronger by the day. 

I think the Russians could’ve pulled off their poker bluff to keep with your analogy, but in a different dimension where the war never got out of the early game phase. On a long enough time frame the cracks of the Russian military begin to show and eventually lead to structural collapse. This doesn’t sound too complicated because it isn’t , but somehow this was too much for the incompetent Russian armed forces. To do that they should’ve maintained a higher element of surprise, spent about another years worth of planning, (for example they should’ve had like 20 backups or simultaneous attacks in the vein of the hostomel landing lol), focused solely or almost exclusively on capturing Kyiv and the leadership. They were stretched thin like not enough butter over too much bread. If they had any gifted tacticians, they were not assigned to Ukraine. I believe the ball was in Russia’s court in the early days and they fumbled, and Ukraine has been running away with a growing lead ever since. Russia may gain Bakmut and a couple other villages , but the trend has shifted, and the next wave of Ukrainian counter assaults this year will in my opinion recapture 50x the territory that Russia has gained in Donbas these last few months",1677394036.0,1677393780.0,t3_11c51ia,t1_ja1w46q,,4,6,0,6,0,0,

The Ukrainians were the industrial heartland of the USSR, there were other places that had arms or space or heavy industry or nuclear talent, but few to none as concentrated as Ukraine. The thing that has been holding them back isn't lack of ideas or talent, it is  systemic corruption; much of which traces it's roots back to Russia. 

On the one side, I am not saying that they won't get ideas from western gear, so much as that they don't necessarily need them.  Moskova was sunk with a indigenous (Neptune) modern AShM, Ukraine has occasionally made strikes well outside of the range of their declared arsenal, which may point to a limited operational capacity for the indigenous Grim-2 SRBM system (potentially up to 500km). They make the BTR-4 in small quantities, which is probably (now that the bugs have been shook out) one of the best BMP/BTR style IFVs ever. The Russians were, ironically, still buying many missile parts and other things for their military from the Ukrainians when they invaded.  

On the other, the Ukrainians have a more current and comprehensive experience experience with near-peer war than anyone else right now. The vibe that I get from western brass is that they kinda hope that the Ukrainians *do get ideas* so that they can integrate those ideas into *their* doctrine moving forward.

There will never be political will for such a thing. These countries have cultures that are vastly too different than the European cultures. They could simply never integrate.
