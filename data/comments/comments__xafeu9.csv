*The enemy in his entire offensive combined everything that is required for modern and not very offensive operations - reconnaissance, strategy (implementation of the plan), advantages in artillery and counter-battery fire, and, most importantly, the motivation of personnel.*

*You can talk about lend-lease for the enemy as much as you like, complain about it, but the West only slightly leveled their forces with these deliveries. You can talk about voluntary mercenaries from different countries who fight for the enemy, but in fact there are only a few of them out of the total. But you need to objectively evaluate your own actions, as well as inaction, which we have not done for 30 years.*

*While it was necessary to hit bridges, railway hubs, and LDPE, which had to be previously opened by intelligence, we reported every day with missiles in Kharkov.

*Well… the day before yesterday in the daily briefing it was reported about another downed Su-25 of the Ukrainian Air Force.

Day 199 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was a lot of shelling again, some aimed at the city, other at the outskirts of Khrakiv/bordering towns. The first time we were shelled around 6:20pm, they aimed at civilians as always, hitting private houses and causing fires. That shelling killed 1 person and injured 2 others. We were then shelled a second time at 7:20pm, pretty much the same places were hit, at least 3 private houses were damaged, but thankfully that time there were no casualties.

After that there was some shelling at 10:45pm, but it wasn’t aimed at the city this time, there were around 4 explosions on the outskirts of Kharkiv. Then at midnight the missile strike started, they fired 9 missiles at us this time, which means they are really mad about their losses. Most of the missiles landed somewhere far away from the city, but at least 2 landed in Kharkiv. The 7th missile was especially loud, it sounded pretty close to us, and then the 9th missile had that weird long sound of explosion.

Those missiles were being launched at intervals every couple of minutes, so while the missile strike started at 12:00am, the last missile landed here at 12:18am, so we had to wait for those missiles for 18 minutes, which sucks a lot, especially when you think that this is the last missile, and then another one is fired a minute later, so you need to go away from the windows again.

But the progress in liberation of our territories is just unbelievable these days, all the progress Russians had achieved in the region since the start of the war undone within a week, they do have every reason to be mad at themselves, but  I still don’t understand why do they think shelling civilians will help them in any way. You can just feel their rage in those strikes against civilians, they are really mad about their entire front disintegrating, but apparently their official stance is that it’s all going according to plan, they definitely meant to abandon all that territory, because that makes sense in their mind I guess?

>
>Mid-July to late August, Ukraine systematically targeted russian supply lines around Kherson, Kharkiv, Crimea, Donbas & other areas. The 80km HIMARS range and other undisclosed arms allowed clinical strikes. The AFU warned of an imminent Kherson counter offensive
>
>2/n The russians, seeing the strikes & warnings, started reinforcing Kherson with up to 30,000 soldiers. The Ukrainians continued to attack logistics, and exit routes, making it almost impossible for russia to resupply their forward soldiers
>
>3/n End of Aug / beginning of Sep, Ukraine announced it was going on the counter offensive in Kherson, but that they would not share any info. Pro-russia journalists and politicians immediately used this to say that the counter-offensive on day 1-2-3 was failing / had failed
>
>4/n Around the 3rd/4th of Sep, rumours started appearing that Ukraine had made enormous gains around Kharkiv, even though this had never been a stated aim for the operation. However, OPSEC did not allow for concrete details. Progress was starting to become visible in Kherson area
>
>5/n On the 5th of Sep, it became obvious to all that Ukraine's counter-offensive was moving rapidly in multiple directions, and they had taken Balakliia by complete surprise – rumours started appearing that it too had been liberated, and the russians could not reinforce there
>
>6/n On 6th Sep, images of Balakliia started appearing with Ukrainian flags, and the general staff announced that more than a dozen settlements had been freed. At the same time, rumours started appearing that Kherson offensive was on, but AFU was moving even faster than expected
>
>7/n 6th cont: OSINT & commentators started talking about a small town called Kupyansk, which was the key to russian supply lines for Izyum, a city they've occupied for months. russians started to realise the level of crap they were in, and became desperate to reinforce
>
>8/n By the 7th, Balakliia was confirmed to be around Ukraine, huge advances in and around Kherson, & it was clear the russians were unable to reinforce in any way. Stories of 1000+ POWs, 600+ KIAs started coming out. Meanwhile, AFU opened up 2 axes to take Kupyansk
>
>9/n By the 8th, reports of further progress had appeared  on all fronts, and the AFU was rumoured to have taken Kupyansk, though not confirmed.
>
>russians lost another 650+ KIA, and serious panic started to spread. Videos surfaced of russians reinforcing, but those were fake
>
>10/n Today, it is certain that Kupyansk has been taken, but the scope of the counter-offensive is bigger than anyone could have imagined. Intense fighting around Izyum, Lyman confirmed, and reports of huge numbers of POWs coming out. At the same time, AFU advances to Kherson
>
>11/n Meanwhile, there have been explosions in Melitopol, Mariupol, Berdyansk, Crimea, and a whole bunch of other cities, by partisans and the AFU.
>
>russians are unable to reinforce in any area, their weapons are not working, and numerous videos are emerging of their surrenders
>
>12/n The real scope of this counter-offensive is unclear, but it's starting to look like a turning point in this war.
>
>Remember, what you or I can see on the internet is behind a day at least. And from what I'm hearing the situation is far worse for the russians than what we see

[**Latest Charts (10 Sept)**](https://imgur.com/a/5j7tKT2)

**What does the data show?**

1. In short, Ukraine controls 79.3% of their core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22. Before February's invasion, they controlled 90.9%.
2. In the past week, Ukraine has liberated 0.8% of their territory (almost 2,000 square miles), and over 750 square miles in the past 24 hours.

🔴 Russian KIAs sit at 30,900 (± 3,100), and the rolling 30-day average is 180 KIA per day.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs sit at 12,200 (± 600), and the rolling 30-day average is 35 KIA per day.

**How is this analysis done?**

I run simple colour analysis tools on the daily update maps published by ISW, and chart in a spreadsheet how these proportions (one colour for Russia, the other for Ukraine) have changed throughout the war.

I track casualties, using Ukrainian figures for Ukraine's losses, which are higher than NATO figures, and NATO figures for Russian losses, which are lower than Ukrainian estimates. I extrapolate where information is missing (by continuing rolling 7-day averages), and make clear the large uncertainties involved. I also only track KIA, so indeed the wounded, captured and desertions may be 2x-3x the KIA figures.",1662835987.0,1662835875.0,t3_xafeu9,t3_xafeu9,,0,68,0,68,0,0,

The Russian Defense Ministry on Saturday confirmed that it had pulled forces out of Balakliya and Izyum, after a decision to “regroup” and transfer them toward the regional capital of Donetsk in the south “in order to achieve the goals of the special military operation.”

The stunning rout of Russian forces by Ukraine’s flash counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region does not, on its own, signal a decisive shift in the war to Ukraine’s advantage.

Russia still occupies extensive Ukrainian territory, including the cities of Mariupol, Melitopol and Kherson, and Russian troops still control Putin’s coveted “land bridge” to Crimea, which Russia annexed illegally in 2014. And on Saturday afternoon, Russia immediately began to pummel the reclaimed territories with a fierce barrage of high-powered missiles.

But the Ukrainian campaign has cut enemy supply lines, revealed disarray in the Russians’ ranks, electrified Ukrainians, forced occupying authorities to flee and infuriated Kremlin boosters.

“A major defeat,” Igor Girkin, a hard-line former commander of separatists in Ukraine, lamented in a pro-Russian military Telegram channel.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his country was still far from claiming any triumph. “A sign of victory for me will be boarding a plane in Kharkiv and landing in Mariupol,” Reznikov said in a speech Saturday at a conference in Kyiv.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at the same conference on a surprise visit to the capital, cheered Ukraine’s gains. “Troops are moving forward; they are not only gaining back territory but liberating people,” Baerbock said. “I think it’s really a moment of hope, even though maybe it’s a small moment of hope. This is what we need.”

…

The advances have come at a cost, according to Ukrainian commanders.
Anatoli Pryhrusha, who led a unit in the fight to take back the town of Balakliya, said in an interview that the fighting had been fierce and bloody. “It’s good the Russians ran away, but we paid with a lot of lives,” Pryhrusha said.

The local victories could add up to a broader strategic shift if Ukrainians continue to press their sudden advantage, analysts said.

Ukrainian troops were pushing southeast along the M03 highway, which would eventually allow them to reconnect Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with the adjacent Donbas region, joining two key front-line theaters.

On Saturday, before the Russian retreat, the mayor of Izyum, an occupied city just 44 miles north of the Donbas city of Kramatorsk, said in an interview that Ukrainian troops had entered his city and were battling Russian troops street by street with small arms and automatic weapons.

“I’m speechless,” the mayor, Valeriy Marchenko, said of the Ukrainians’ rapid and unexpected progress in the region. “No one was expecting this to be so fast.”

The pullout from Izyum, which Russia had used as a resupply hub for its offensive through the eastern Donbas region, marked one of the biggest setbacks for Russia since its troops rolled into Ukraine in February.

With Russian troops out of Izyum, Russia’s ability to fulfill its objective of seizing the entirety of the Donbas region — the only publicly declared goal of Putin’s proclaimed “special military operation” — is now in doubt, said Kirill Mikhailov, a Kyiv-based analyst with the Conflict Intelligence Team, a Russian military research group.

Izyum is an important command and supply hub for Russia’s northern front and Russia’s only major bridgehead on the right bank of the Donets River, he said, and losing it would eliminate an entire front — the northern front — in its efforts to conquer Donetsk.

“The bottom line is that it really improves Ukrainian chances of retaining Donetsk,” he said.

Russia’s confirmation of the Ukrainian advances sparked furious rebukes by its supporters on what normally would be a day of jubilant celebrations of City Day, an annual holiday, in Moscow.

“Tonight, the capital of our Motherland — the city of Moscow — will salute the surrender of Balakliya, Izyum and half of Kupyansk to the enemy with 25,000 high-altitude fireworks,” Girkin wrote on Telegram. Indeed, throughout the afternoon, high-powered explosions were being felt as Russia pounded the Kharkiv region with rockets.

Girkin complained bitterly about extravagant celebrations for City Day in Moscow, where Putin visited a new martial arts center and presided over the openings of a section of new highway and a giant, 460-foot tall Ferris wheel called the Moscow Sun.

“There is nothing like that in Europe,” Putin said, according to the Tass news agency. “It is very important for people to have a chance to chill out with their family and friends.”

Girkin has long warned that Russia cannot win the war without a massive military mobilization, a move the Kremlin has avoided because it would be deeply unpopular to require conscriptions in the urban centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg.

“For Russia, things are only going to get worse,” said Lee, the military analyst. “For Russia, this is going to cause a morale problem. There aren’t any good reasons for Russia to believe it can achieve any more in Ukraine than it already has.”",False,1662848858.0,t3_xafeu9,t3_xafeu9,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

It looks likely that the best case scenario is a gruelling defeat taking many losses over months until an inevitable ultimate defeat. Taking losses can be justified if you're taking ground but not of your side is in terminal decline. 

This leaves you with two choices. Die pointlessly(from your perspective) in war your side will lose eventually anyway.
Or just take the L and bail now and atleast you can live your old life again maybe.

You know the people who have been saying for literal months before today that Russia's rate of attrition is not sustainable?

They were right and this success is the result of that.

You know those people advocating patience, saying that outside of holding action Ukraine is furiously preparing to retake their lands? 

They were right and the success is the result of that. 

This has been months in the making. A massive amount of planning and preparation have gone into this. Those guys who died from shelling, holding seemingly hopeless positions in Popasna? This is what they were buying time for.

The Ukraine battle front is huge. Russia's starting nominal force was around 220k between ""LNR/DPR"" and all branches of Russian military. This includes supply, navy, air and air defense. It's also going with nominal unit headcounts, which are likely inflated for well documented reasons. 

Well, Russia has surely sustained over 100k casualties in killed, serious injury or MIA / deserted / captured.   The remaining force has been fighting for *seven months.* Russia has been using a variety of manpower sources indicating they aren't regenerating troops appropriately.

Oh and Russia is the invader so they are also using some of this force to control rear areas.

Command and control was always their Achilles-heel. Rigid, top-down power structures are brittle and prone to collapse.

We're sourcing medical supplies requested by Hospitallers brigade that are hard for orgs on the ground to procure in Europe. Amazon will ship them to the fundraiser's house and she ships them to Kyiv.  
  
\- We've collected 231 items total so far! That's over $7,600 in supplies! We still hope people will continue to contribute if they have spare cash! Check out our [public spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bRbCobUuLC3gUJVvn9kZZyBV1x96g33CXapozBoDLHs/edit#gid=0) tracking contributions and shipments. We update it at least daily.  
  
\- We shipped our [third shipment](https://twitter.com/annabananastand/status/1567943961318412288) the other day! This brings us to a total of $5,598 in supplies shipped to Ukraine. You can track the packages in the spreadsheet linked above. Our first two shipments are now in international shipments, and we're estimating the first one will arrive in a week (hopefully). We do express shipping, but our test package that we did before this fundraiser took 3 weeks.  
  
\- FOX Chest Seals are back up to $25! But this is still the cheapest yet one of the most desperately needed items. Celox Rapid is the other one the Hospitallers have asked for urgently.

ebfeb9bb30bf522444167d8c4b0ae268,xafeu9,inukz7p,"Just throwing out some thoughts:

Russia started the invasion with something like 200k troops and maybe a few dozen thousand from the separatist regions. 

A fairly conservative estimate is that 30k Russian troops have died. With standard estimate of 3x the wounded, that's at least 120k troops out of fighting. Russia claims it doesn't use conscripts in the invasion (it does, but maybe some of that was accidental) and instead everyone is on a contract. Those contracts often are only for a few months, and if I was a Russian soldier, I certainly wouldn't renew my contract after seeing what happened in April. So how many tens of thousands have had their contract expire and have gone home? How many soldiers are missing from the statistics and have had to go home because their health has entirely collapsed from spending over 6 months without proper rotation at the front lines? 

All put together, I don't think it is too unrealistic to say that more or less the whole original invasion army has died, is wounded, has deserted, or has gone home. 
The question is, how many people has Russia been able to recruit to replace them? A few thousand Wagner mercenaries, maybe some tens of thousands of volunteers and people ""covertly mobilized""?

Months ago, many analysts were saying that Russia needs to mobilize, because it takes months to do, and in a few months they will have run out of manpower in the attrition war. And now we are a few months later, there was no mobilization, and Russian defences seem to be folding like cheap soggy cardboard, with pretty much no one there to meet the Ukrainian push. 

Russia, a country whose name is almost a synonym for ""endless manpower"" has somehow managed to run out of manpower. That they haven't mobilized seems by now seems clear evidence to me that they cannot mobilize. Either they are too stupid to understand that they should have mobilized, or the leadership doesn't have the political capital and public support to mobilize without facing a revolution, or they think they don't have the means to effectively organise a mobilization, and a failed mobilization would be the worst humiliation of all, and reveal that Russian defences basically don't exist, which sounds like a massive security risk to me unless you are 100% confident in your nuclear deterrent.",False,1662813855.0,t3_xafeu9,t3_xafeu9,,0,54,0,54,0,0,

The equipment they're getting is what NATO can spare. In the case of the US it's extra hardware that's warehoused and not actively deployed anywhere. The training Ukraine has gotten has at most taken place over what... 6 months?

And Russia with supposedly the 2nd strongest military has gotten creamed by them from start to finish. First with their failed attempt to take Kiev, next with their embarassing summer offensive which resulted in very few gains outside of Donbas and catastrophic losses. Now this rout, which may prove to be the decisive end to Russian occupation if Ukraine can secure the territory they've gained ahead of winter.

I won't say that western intelligence, training, and supplies haven't been factors, but none of that matters if Ukraine loses its will to fight or fails to execute. They've only become more resolved as things have gone on. Meanwhile, Russia is looking like internal collapse of the regime is imminent. This is going to be an epic account for the history books, and Ukraine has more than earned its independence and entry into the EU once this is over.

* Reparations in the multi-billions to compensate families and help rebuild Ukraine. May or may not come from frozen assets
* Return of all POWs and trafficked Ukrainian citizens
* War crime tribunals of key civilian and military leaders

I may be mistaken in my optimism, but I believe Russia may agree to these terms in return for sanctions being lifted, as this is when western economic warfare will truly shine. Ukraine can't and won't push into Russia proper because of nukes (and because it's not their territory), so the only leverage the West has over Russia is sanctions. By that time, the long-term effects of sanctions will (hopefully) be fully felt. The foreign currency reserves will be at critical levels, the economy will be in shambles, and everyday Russians will be living in even more misery than they are right now. So hopefully the Russian government (presumably not led by Putin anymore) will agree in return for some semblance of normalcy.",False,1662816338.0,t3_xafeu9,t3_xafeu9,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

on the prospects for the development of events in light of the information presented, assuming that it was correct.
First, Putin gave the floor to Patrushev, but he offered to give the floor to representatives of the General Staff.

He literally in a few words expressed confidence that the information contained in the report corresponds to the plans of the USA, after which he said that our troops have no more offensive opportunities, and soon there will be no opportunity for defence.

Further, he summarized with the phrase: ""You lost Vladimir Vladimirovich!"" After that, he fell silent, and because of the shock of the participants in the meeting, who were sincerely amazed at the audacity of the general, there was a long pause.

The pause was interrupted by Patrushev. He said: ""How do you talk to the supreme commander?"" To which the general began to respond with a stream of new, no less harsh statements, and they hurriedly disconnected him from the call.


Then yesterday it was a clear desire to express a complaint to the President in his face. The military leadership is well aware that they will be made guilty of the defeat in the war that Putin unleashed.

Therefore, we should expect further discontent in the circles of the leadership of the military bloc, whom the President simply has to make ""scapegoats""

The news in Ukraine always seemed so far off in the background. Putin's assassinations were as ordinary as news of a hurricane. Something horrible but natural that happens from time to time. The plane that downed over Ukraine, and the bellingcat boys before I knew what bellingcat was pulling traffic cam footage to prove it was the Russians when we all knew it was them. Deny deny deny.

Trump ran for office, and news of his campaign manager quitting the summer before the election for his involvement with Viktor Yanucovic. New names coming out over the radio on my way home from work.

Trump was elected, and news of Putin's fuckery. More new names. Learned more and more and more about the horrible things America has done and the horrible things the ussr did as I read and read and read. I learned a lot about intelligence agencies. And money laundering. And lies. Lots of lies. Ukraine elects a new president, a comedian. Man I wish someone like John Stewart would run for office here.

Seeing my loved ones and relatives twist and morph into angry, ignorant, hateful morons. Learning more and more about the crazy shit floating around online, and listening to Rush Limbaugh and Glen Beck and Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. The Mueller report is released, but redacted and misrepresented and long and clunky and boring to the public. Shortly after, the young comedian president of ukraine's name is in the news again. Trump is impeached for a gruesome quid pro quo. This for that, or else.... Lies lies lies, no consequence. 

Then COVID. More lies. Lies about vaccines. Lies about COVID numbers. ""It's just a flu"" they say. Black Lives Matter, election fraud, lies lies lies. The world is quietly trying to hold it together, and the lies are pulling us apart. January 6. More lies. The world picks up the pieces as the hospitals resign to our new paradigm. More lies. 

December 2021. Russia is staging troops on the border. And blood transfusions and vehicles and missiles. This is pointed out, and Putin lies. And releases a manifesto draped in history sewn with lies. More lies. 
Invasion. Special military operation. Lies. Hate. Ignorance. 

Our world is falling apart. Climate change is going to make us do horrible things to each other is we cannot communicate. And you cannot communicate with hate and lies for long. Eventually, blood spills. 

And as I've stared into my little bright rectangle to try to find out what the fuck is going on, and how it got to this, I have found myself absorbed in the dance around the drain. 
Putin is naked standing on the mountain of his lies. I had a philosophy professor tell our class, the greatest ideal in life is to, after having loved your life, be able to stand naked in the sun. I don't know if I've lived up to that ideal. But I try to be honest and to seek the truth in the world and myself.

And to see Putin now at this, the global high watermark for bullshit ever pooled... All I can do is wait. May the blinding light of truth cut through him like a sword once and for all.

When they take Kherson I bet there is no reason to expect much resistance from theother side either and the south all the way to Crimea is vulnerable. I bet they have plans for crossing the dnipro fast. Then it's time to blow the kerch bridge and isolate Crimea and start picking away at positions in stranded Crimea taking their time. A small force sets up to keep Crimea defended. That can wait and be degraded now that the Kerch bridge is blown. While the main force heads east and pushes toward Meletopol from the west while Russian troops are mostly set up north of there and facing north at the front.

The northern UKR forces are free now and can pinch down from the south on Donbas and the southern Forces come at Donbas area from the south.meanwhile a small force kicks the Russians out of Straight north of Kharkuv.

Crimea is isolated and can't resupply so its just like Kherson Oblast right now.

The reason I think of a Sherman's March to the Azov sea from Luhansk is because the Donbass has more hilly and forest terrain compared to the flat farming regions of the south and Kherson, so it could be ""safer"" to push. There are also more towns concentrated in this region so we could see more urban combat, to fully test the combined arms tactics of the Ukrainians. 

Attack the resupplies from Russia through the limited number road into the Donbass region, so the land corridor in the south could be cut off. This leaves the Russians with only the Crimean corridor. Then the Kerch bridge can be blown up, cutting off the South from resupply.

That front was depopulated for the longest time. It is a huge line defended by a single division with questionable readiness. If UA has one more 20k unit or two, then the time is near for an offensive towards Melitopol. Again, I am no expert, but I roam the internet for juicy UKR-RU war content and seen somewhere (dont remember where) that UKR prepared 3 army corps (~20k strong) for these offensives. One is in Kherson, one is in Kharkiv, the other? I just hope they are prawling for their chance to march on Melitopol.

It is the perfect setting for such an operation. Kherson fight is going on, there is panic to stop UA in Kharkiv with whatever RU has. Just as the UA offensive on Kharkiv culminates, I believe they will go for it. The war may look very different before winter comes.

In a country there is hawks and doves. 

In russia, the hawks want to annex ukraine, and the doves want to do business with the west.

which of them support putin?

Obviously not the doves, as the sanction stop exactly that.

But the hawk only conditionally support putin - only if putin is making progress on ukraine annexation. 

In fact, the hawks have beefs with putin. 

Back in 2014, it is putin who stop Strelkov from conquering the ukraine in one go, and now, it is putin who decide to pull troops for military exercise, and putin who micromanage the troops, causing the collapse at the eastern front.

In at most 1 year, the doves will realize the sanction hit really hard, and the energy card does jack shit, while the hawk will realize that ukraine will never be annexed and will be 'fallen to the westen side' forever.

I do believe the defense and ability to counterattack in the Donetsk reason will be the true show of if this can be turned around and what kind of timeline that will prove to be.

took the city under their control. The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation retain a small part of the city, which has neither actual nor strategic importance, as it is under constant fire.

The enemy in their entire offensive combined everything that is required for modern (and not only) offensive operations - reconnaissance, strategy (implementation o the plan), advantages in artillery and counter-battery fire, and, most importantly, the motivation of personnel.
You can talk about lend-lease for the enemy as much as you like, complain about it, but the West only slightly leveled their forces with these deliveries. You can talk about voluntary mercenaries from different countries who fight for the enemy, but in fact there are only a few of them out of the total. But you need to objectively evaluate your own action, as well as inaction, which we have not done for 30 years.
While it was necessary to hit bridges, railway hubs, and personnel location
positions, which had to be previously located by intelligence, we reported every day about missiles in Kharkiv.

What we *think* went on is that UA went great deal into psyops to persuade **everybody** that the only front they are currently interested in is Kherson.  
They moved troops there, they moved equipment there. Even from other fronts.  
Russian took it and reinforced the area, too late realizing that UA is destroying the bridges behind them. Instead of letting it go, they reinforced it further.  
All attention was on Kherson.

At the same time, either new troops or some existing troops moved to the Kharkiv front with APCs (which have not been used to assault much in this war so far). Either Russia didn't notice this or didn't think it was a strong enough force to break the front.

Then once the Kherson offensive started and communications (both information and resources) were saturated towards that front, UA started the counteroffensive, bypassing bigger blocks of RU forces and instead striking at their rear with the mentioned APCs.

This force didn't ""clean house"", they struck, broke formation and left again, moving into other places. The fog of war that Russia experiences is *very* vulnerable to such strategies, they didn't know what to reinforce, how much and where. 

During the state of the front being broken and units moving back and forth, UA territory forces moved in and cleaned house behind them (these are the ones we see the liberation videos from).  This is also where we see the ""abandoned equipment"" from.

In conjuction with that we know that the BTG's in the Kharkiv Oblast, specifically the Izium area, were already quite damaged and have been for a while. It's why that front has been relatively low in activity compared to other areas. 

On top of those two things, they did try to create a small offensive from there and north of Kharkiv in order to try and relieve some pressure from Kherson. This failed and cost them further manpower.

In short, that section got massively weakened and simply had way less manpower left than they needed to form an effective defense.   
Ukraine managed to break through the first few lines, and found there was basically nothing behind it that could stop them. 

What followed was rapid advances to cut off and encircle the smaller units spread out across the Oblast and deal with them. Meanwhile the Russians simply couldn't respond fast enough. Just no large enough forces concentrated to do so, and their command network probably couldn't keep up either. And I would bet there was also simply a lack of preparation for if the Ukrainians ever got that deep. 

I assume their morale also simply broke in a lot of cases, mass surrenders and desertions. 

There simply was no real stiff resistance anywhere it, and if there was some, it got cut off and surrounded, making any resistance pointless. 

This is what I think might have happened in part, and I may be mistaken on some points. But we'll find out in time.

What this meant was that Russia started moving some of its ""reserves"" to Kherson in order to prepare for that counter offensive.  


Once that happened, Ukraine blew up the bridges, trapping the majority of those troops in Kherson. Ukrainian counter offensive in Kherson started, and now those Russian troops were, well, stuck there fighting the Ukrainian counter offensive.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military was silently (but not completely covertly) massing troops around Kharkiv for a counter offensive. Some Russian military bloggers on telegram were warning about this move for days, but apparently those warnings fell in deaf years, because when the Ukrainians struck, **they had achieve complete and total surprise.** And once the Ukrainian troops broke through the very thin Russian lines, they basically had a free hand to do whatever they wanted. Russia was left scrambling to find troops that they could throw in front of the Ukrainian advance, and they did do that, but the Ukrainians didn't wanted to get bogged down fighting, so they simply left small groups to pin those Russian forces in those towns/villages while the main Ukrainian forces just kept going towards Kupyansk.   


And that's it really. Russia simply did not expected a Ukrainian counter attack in that sector, they were so fixated in Kherson that they left the rest of their frontline extremely weak in terms of forces capable of a meaningful defense, and once those forces were routed, they had no reserves to use.",False,1662815045.0,t3_xafeu9,t1_inukbcg,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

If I'm honest, I only knew better because my friend is native Russian and was extremely familiar with Russian politics and their military. I think her words were ""Russia has less than half the population of America as well as it's population declining, the GDP of Florida, the corruption of a central African nation, an epidemic of alcoholism and depression and a narcissistic moron who thinks being a former errand boy for the KGB makes him worthy of tsardom in charge of it all. Russia will collapse from a stiff breeze, let alone a fight with NATO""

If not for our very detailed conversations on the subject, I would have kept seeing Russia as the world power it portrayed itself as, and not as the rump state it really was.

When Russia invaded I knew they were screwed. Best case for russia, the west stays out of it like they did in 2014 and Russia slowly grinds Ukraine down until their army suddenly evaporates, only to return as partisans who would slowly bleed Russia for twenty years until they are forced to leave. That was their best case scenario. What's happening now is everything they had nightmares about along with some stuff they thought was to scary to even be real.

Here in Moldova we had a wannabe dictator who refused to accept election results (his party lost), the US Ambassador took a 5 minutes (actually) visit to his office, he was on a plane and never seen again in matter of an hour.

All after he built his regime for almost 10 years, constantly scheming, blackmailing everyone, we really started to believe that we will never get rid of him. 5 minutes, 5 fucking minutes it’s all it took.

That's the funny dichotomy, if you can mobilise, you probably don't need to due to the sheer amount of volunteers.

Let's be honest, if the populace isn't willing to go fight and die, handing them weapons and telling them to go fight and die, is a recipe for disaster, insurection, and straight up revolts and rebellions.

And aside from that there's every other requirement that mobilisation has, such as supplies and training. And right now it probably is too late in the year to consider mobilisation anyway.

The war in the east was more successful because Russia was able to get supplies through using railway lines, unlike in Kyiv where Russians basically had no supplies and the attack fell apart. The north eastern part of Russia's war is about to turn into a re-enactment of their Kyiv assault.

Even days later Stalin was still trying to ""clarify"" the situation with Hitler. He had deliberately kept the border territories in Poland weak and unfortified to avoid provoking Germany.

So, because of his incompetence, the priority was to buy time for rear reserves to be organised. Stalin did this by feeding millions into the meat grinder. Would that have egregious sacrifice been necessary if the Soviets had been slightly organised and fortified along the border and had reserves at the ready. Not likely.

Also, when you consider that Germany might not have invaded Poland without the non-aggression pact with Stalin, which helped Hitler steer clear of his two-front war nightmare, and therefore in effect Stalin was a party to starting the war, the Soviet leader is more of a bungling idiot than anything else.",False,1662811713.0,t3_xafeu9,t1_inuggzp,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,xafeu9,invsv2g,"Indeed. It seems clear now that what many analysts have been saying for months has come to fruition. Russia has overextended itself by putting on maximum pressure on Ukraine and it's own military in an attempt to break the Ukrainian resistance (or rather, to achieve unattainable political goals for the Putin regime), and is now reaping the results. 

While the war for many months outwardly seemed to be in a balance, it was in fact the Ukrainians taking their time and building up strength, and the Russians using up strength. Ukraine appears to have successfully build a force generating pipeline in terms of manpower and materiel, whereas Russia has not. One has to wonder what options are left for Russia at this stage. A full mobilization will have a large political impact for the Putin regime, will take months to come to fruition, is still lagging half a year behind Ukraine's mobilization pipeline, is hampered by the economical and political isolation of Russia and most importantly, does not solve the systematic issues that have been plaguing the Russian military since the start of this war. In other words, they can get more soldiers, but they will have a hard time equipping and motivating them, nor will they be able to effectively use these soldiers because of the core issues in their command structure. 

Ukraine in the meanwhile can expect more and more support based on this success from NATO countries. Stoltenberg is now calling for NATO countries to dip into stocks they had previously reserved for their own use. If such transfers end up occurring, the shift in balance will continue to accelerate in Ukraine's favour. 

Russia appears to have no options left to it. People talk about nuclear escalation, but one has to wonder what actual battlefield result that would yield, and for what price. The Ukrainian army isn't clumped up, it's dispersed over a huge front and most of the fighting happens in civilian area's. India and China would very likely react highly negative to the use of such weapons as it would escalate the conflict from something remote to something that would actually threaten their own existence. Russia would not only be completely isolated then, but could likely expect a non-nuclear but direct response from NATO. 

Best bet Putin seems to have is try to consolidate his internal power. Keep repressing the local population and take out any political adversaries he might see. Essentially go full North-Korea. It's not a great play, but it seems to be the one that would best keep him alive and in power.",False,1662832790.0,t3_xafeu9,t1_invpho9,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

However the math of advancing is painful. The further you advance the harder it is to resupply and the easier it is for the enemy. Every 1km advance gives 2km of flank - 50km of advance on a 20km front (which is what they have approximately) is 120km of frontline. 

The southern section of that is a pocket they are closing, so eventually that will enable them to shorten their lines again. They are also protected on the east by the river. They should be able to comfortably consolidate where they are. Advancing more though means crossing that river, then pushing further without opportunities to shorten the front lines.

100km of advance is 220km of front line, more if the push is broadened out. It's 200km from Kharkiv to the eastern Donbas.

At some point they'll need to stop, refuel and rearm. They'll need to build up forward supply depots, cycle troops out of the frontline for repairs and replacements, move up theatre level assets like strategic air defence and air support.

A retreat is when you know where all of your troops are and are communicating with them. IE: everyone knows where to meet up. Think ""fire drill"", everyone is leaving from the school because the (pretend) fire is coming at you, but everyone knows where to go.

A rout means that those soldiers ran away so fast, they don't even know where they're going yet. Russia needs to publicly say where to meetup again so that the troops can reform and reorganize. Instead of an organized fire-drill, everyone ran off in different directions during the fire, so no one actually knows where anyone else is (no one knows who the survivors are, where to meet, if the Ukrainian army is still advancing, etc. etc.)

The cascading route was a real phenomenon in pre-modern pitched battles, but the total war games actually get it somewhat backwards.

It usually wasn't the guys in the first row who started a rout, even if they were being pushed back by a superior enemy. It was the guys in the back getting a sense that things were about to go poorly and deciding to flee that led the disintegration of most formations. From the front lines an individual likely had very little idea how the overall battle was going, and if you're part of an army that might be on the verge of defeat, you're never going to get a better chance to flee safely than the moment the the guy behind you decides to bail.

The biggest killers of pre-modern armies (by far) were disease and starvation, but if you just measure soldiers wounded or killed by their enemies, most of the damage was done *after* an army broke formation and started to flee. Movies tend to show chaotic brawls that look like hundreds of individuals engaging in scores of individual little duels to the death, but that's almost never how it happened. Victory went to the side that could keep their formation while forcing the enemy to break rank.

23541285f4b695d2b9ebe65e1f610748,xafeu9,inufhcb,"I made this comparison earlier, but I think your assessment of Grant's Overland campaign is flawed here.

The goal was always to defeat Lee's army and take Richmond, but Grant understood to do that required the ability of the Confederate States to support the war (meaning both supplies and the desire to continue the fight) to be demolished.

Grant also knew that the fight against Lee would be a slog, but if he kept up the pressure and didn't allow Lee to reposition, reset, and re-deploy forces to other theatres - that would open up an opportunity for Sherman/Meade and the Army of the Tennessee to sweep south on the east and west flanks and rip out the soft underbelly of the Confederacy that was supplying all of the food, clothes, and ammunition to Lee's Army.

Operationally, defeating Lee was the most crucial goal, but that goal was best served by undermining Lee's logistics and supply chain. Sherman played a great part in this, but Grant also was masterful in how he executed his own campaign. He consistently pressed Lee, regardless if he won or lost the previous battle (Including a pretty bad misstep by Grant at Cold Harbor) and executing a brilliant night time march to cut off Lee's attempt retreat across the river.

All of this is pretty well documented via letters and records to Lincoln and Sherman, Sheridan, and Meade.

Anyway, the point is - I don't think Kherson is a feint. It's too good of a target of opportunity to pass up and too important of a location for Russia to not want to take back, especially given there's essentially 20-30k Russian troops trapped without a way out unless they want to swim. It's just a different kind of fight than what is going on in Kharkiv - much more dense in terms of manpower on both sides, Russia has defense in depth in Kherson, and the quality of Russian Troops is higher. 

That being said, the position Grant put the Confederacy in during the Overland Campaign, where there were no good choices for the Confederacy to make, is very similar in design to what Ukraine is doing now.",False,1662810549.0,t3_xafeu9,t1_inuc5ey,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

While in the east Ukraine brilliantly exploited the weakness of russian lines, it was still a properly planned, supplied and conducted offensive.
It did benefits from the russian commitment in Kherson, and in that way Kherson was usefull for focusing attention away from the east.

That being said, the Kherson push is just an important operation, just not intended to gain quick ground, but tu force russia to feed troops to a untenable position over a major river, with very limited supply options, where they can be ground down with less Ukrainian casualties.

And regarding the Marders. Last I've read, there was still the problem to source ammunition. The ammo for the Marder guns is produced by Switzerland and they don't allow an export to Ukraine. IFVs without ammo are not very useful. Also, the vehicles in question are decades old and were delivered back to the manufacturer to scrap them. Most likely it would take a long time to refurbish them.

The conservative media and political opposition in Germany likes to make it look like only the government is holding deliveries of weapons back. The truths is different.

Germany just isn't sitting on large stockpiles of operational heavy weapons that can be delivered to Ukraine in short time.

No.

Mobilisation takes a long time to have an effect, it took Ukraine 6 months and longer.

And they had help in training, logistics, command and equipment.

Russia doesn't have any reasonable capacity in any of these areas. Just at a basic level, they don't have enough infantry equipment, let alone everything else.

They'd be mobilising people, giving them 100 year old equipment at best and then due to a lack of functioning vehicles, walking them everywhere that wasn't rail.

Also... all pontoon crossings are within range of HIMARS and other artillery.

It's the same problem in reverse. If they bring troops down from Kharkiv/Izyum to Kherson then the Ukranian counter offensive in the north / northeast will only gain in strength in taking back more territory.

1. Fixing forces to lock the advance in position

2. Reinforcing exploitation forces to hit the flanks of the pocket and close it into a cauldron.

A classic example of this is Stalingrad Vs The Battle of the Bulge. In the latter the Germans were fought to a standstill, but the Allies lacked the coordination and forces to close the pocket before the Germans mostly withdrew.

In the former, the Germans were fixed and focussed on Stalingrad and neglected their flanks, allowing the Soviets to cross the flank west and south of the city and close off the pocket.

In the context of Kharkiv, the RU forces can likely reinforce to the *north* of the current pocket using supply lines towards Belgorod. How far the UA forces can push before they need resupply Vs the RU forces can produce a suitable blocking force will be interesting to observe. Given enough time, a force could be *theoretically* deployed here to counterattack into the pocket.

However the south of the current pocket, towards Izyum come *through the pocket*. That means the troops there are limited to their current forces and supplies. They themselves are now in a pocket where they will need to defend on nearly all sides, making redeployment to block the southward UA push challenging. Much more likely is that RU will attempt to extricate themselves here or be cut off. 

The east of the pocket is the Oskil river, which the UA forces have at least damaged the crossing places and should be fairly defensible. Little chance of easy counterattack there.

In general, RU reinforcement are unlikely to be able to mass unseen for counterattack given UAs access the western aerial and satellite intelligence.

Russian forces are a joke because they arnt fighting for anything. They are demoralised. Now put them in Russia, fighting for their families and you will see a different thing.  

All unternational supplies of weapons to Ukraine would stop. No way would NATO countries supply weapons to invade a nuclear power. Ukraine would suddenly find themselves alone and Russia would find themselves with volunteers queued up to fight. Russia would absolutely win a defensive war against Ukraine Invading them and by that point Russia would have a massive army of battle hardened soldiers filled with hate. When they finished repulsing the invasion they would sweep through Ukraine leaving a trail of devastation. Not to mention it would give China the excuse it needs to send aid and test their weapons against NATO gear safely (China make a big deal in not violating sovereignty).

The army is running away but they dont have a particular destination in mind, and they dont have a secured route, theyre just running.

Ukraine is doomed...

There's just one problem.  See... nobody told Russia that Ukraine just doesn't give a fuck about pain, and will never, ever stay down, and will crawl through its own teeth and blood for one more chance to stab Russia.

Ukraine got a couple of good punches in, including a really nice hook that staggered Russia for a bit.  Russia backed off slightly, got a bit more cautious.  Ukraine feinted at Russia's nose, Russia thought it saw it coming and reacted...

And Ukraine kicked Russia so hard in the nuts that Russia instantly went from baritone to falsetto.

Without it for all intents and purposes they no longer have a black seas fleet since Ukraine is going to make it impossible for any ports that Russia has itself in the Black Sea to function militarily in the future without risk of missile spam from hell.   They can always reconstitute the equipment eventually lost up north but they can't afford to lose any land now in the southern region around Kherson.  Doing so effective cuts off the Crimea at this point making it untenable.   So when you have depleted resources of low quality you can write them off in 1 sector and just pile them up in the south in the hope you can get a peace deal done quickly.  Which is delusional at this point on Russia part but so was the invasion.  In either case.  Wild prediction.

That event showed the potential that the Ukraine Army had to take back what was theirs, and more than that, it kind of validates that western training and methods are far far superior to Russian training and methods. They're based on values that civilian lives matter, and individual soldiers matter, and training and expertise of experienced officers matters; and good equipment, well maintained and cared for, and designed for reliability and maximum effectiveness matters. Investing in people matters, and Oligarchs don't fucking matter at all, and they do nothing but drag the rest of the people down. These are the values that Russia just fails to grasp. Though they're proven constantly to work.

Ukraine was so far the underdog back in February. Both in numbers and equipment. But it was those that had been training with Western Allies since 2014 who transformed this fighting force into something that had the potential to gain the upper hand, and force a rout like this.

I was overly optimistic, because I hoped this was going to happen back in June, and it didn't.  Then Ukraine announced they were recruiting a ton more troops, and it didn't look like Russia was able to do shit to even rebuild their forces from the Kyiv loss.  Over the next few months we saw sign after sign: the bombing of the landing ships in Berdyansk, the sinking of the Moskva, the re-taking of Snake Island, and the utter denial of Transnistria to even get their fucking shoes on.  Each one of these gave Ukraine another advantage that it's clear that Russian leadership just had zero contingency plans for. 

I'm really glad to have watched all this unfold over the past 4 days. I hope Ukraine can get their abducted citizens back, and I hope that all of the Russian war criminals can be captured and brought to justice.

Furthermore, ""tankies"" themselves (already an increasingly vague terminology in modern days) really include only a fraction of those spreading Russian propaganda, the main culprits being, well, Russians. When people talk about ""Russian milibloggers"", with few exceptions, they actually *mean* Russian, and Russian-speaking, people, running military blogs (often Telegram channels, nowadays) - not Western supporters of Russia's war efforts (read: Western Putin shills).

The reason they're often talked about, particularly these past few days, is, as I see it, that they're a decent tool to gauge the ""temperature"" of Russian morale *behind* the lines. The government (which the milbloggers obviously parrot the stance of, in terms of ideology and the like, given that milbloggers are most often run by members of the military) will never admit to anything, but these people can, and have, admitted to, and lamented, losses.

The Bundeswehr currently has only about half of the heavy equipment operational that it should have to do this job. There are no reserves left. That sadly includes Leopard 2.

I don't think any government would completely disarm itself and disregard the alliance that offers protection to all of Europe in a time like this.

There are other NATO countries, that have way more weapons to spare and can provide Ukraine with them. Germany's strengths is in other areas. Maybe even more important that the economic support it can provide is the political influence Germany can put behind Ukraine's interests.

Yes.  But unfortunately I think it is unlikely that Ukraine has the forces to support this and will need to pause and consolidate.  Ukraine's got a pretty big win here, and doesn't need to risk a successful counterattack.

Time to push on the Russian supply situation and capture isolated .ru forces.  Maybe there's time for another big push before weather deteriorates in late October.

Then it becomes a question of who replenishes most successfully over the winter.  Western production exceeds Russian by a big factor (espc after sanctions).  But Russia is in such a state of disarray that they have a large degree of improvement available just by screwing up less.  Further, by pushing them back to occupy less territory, their manpower shortage will be less.

But while they tried everything to give a peaceful solution a chance, they also reacted strong and decisive when Putins actions made it clear that this was impossible.

Russian troops are going to be needing winter gear and significant fuel for heating which I cant imagine they are able to prioritize right now. And barring those things Russian defensive positions would be substantially degraded.

I dont think Ukrainian snowfall is so severe as to proclude winter movement, and unlike spring thaw and Rasputitsa frozen ground doesn't prevent movement.  The biggest hurdle is being able to keep equipment functional and soldiers warm enough for movement (but this goes for the defense as well to a degree). So I dont think the winter is so harsh in the southern part of Ukraine to preclude a winter operation.

Now, can Ukraine get enough winter gear and winterized equipment, and have the training to mount a winter offensive? No idea.

The amount of rear guard and reserve are what determines how much territory they can take, especially since every enemy they bypass requires more manpower.  On the other hand, straightening the lines, or going to the final positions where they can start reinforcing means less manpower is needed later.  That's the gamble I am referring to for when they stop.

As far as blitz tactics, I mean that Ukraine is not just going for land and trying to cut off and Seige every little village.  Instead, from what we've seen so far, they use some brave people in fast vehicles to do the same job that paratroopers do.
