From CNN's Oleksandra Ochman and Bex Wright

Ukraine's army has carried a series of counterattacks in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, but Russian forces still control ""most"" of the city, a regional Ukrainian military official said.

Severodonetsk is one of the last remaining strongholds held by Ukraine in the eastern region of Luhansk.

The head of the Luhansk Military Administration, Serhiy Hayday, said that the Kremlin's forces did not make any headway Wednesday night in their attempt to capture Severodonetsk, despite Russian claims that the they have taken the whole city.

Hayday has previously said that 10,000 Russian-controlled troops are fighting to take the city.

The counteroffensives by Ukrainian troops managed to move enemy forces away from some streets and allowed them to capture some prisoners of war, according to Hayday.

""They don’t control the whole city, fighting is going on,” Hayday said.

From CNN's Yulia Kesaieva, Bex Wright, Barbara Starr and Ellie Kauffman.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov has publicly thanked US President Joe Biden and the US military for including HIMARS rocket systems in the next round of security assistance to Ukraine.

“I was pleased to see in the 11th package of military aid to Ukraine the six letters for which the whole country has been waiting: HIMARS,"" Reznikov said in a Twitter post on Thursday.

""Our cooperation is stronger than ever! Thank you.""

In a statement on Wednesday, Biden formally announced the inclusion of the US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) as part of the package to Ukraine.

“This new package will arm them with new capabilities and advanced weaponry, including HIMARS with battlefield munitions, to defend their territory from Russian advances. We will continue to lead the world in providing historic assistance to support Ukraine’s fight for freedom,” Biden said. 

The systems will have a range of about 70 kilometers (44 miles), a US defense official told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday, which is further than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. Ukraine had sought longer range weapons, but the US resisted due to concerns they would be capable of striking Russian territory, thereby potentially escalating the war.",False,1654156905.0,t3_v309mx,t3_v309mx,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

This comes at a time when non-OPEC leader Russia, a major player in global energy markets, faces a barrage of Western sanctions and a partial oil ban from the European Union in the wake of the onslaught in Ukraine.

OPEC delegates are reportedly concerned about the growing economic pressure on Russia and its ability to pump more crude to cool soaring prices.

CNBC has contacted a spokesperson for Russia’s energy ministry and OPEC for comment.

OPEC and non-OPEC countries are scheduled to discuss the next phase of production policy on Thursday.

""In the Kherson region, the Armed Forces have liberated 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) of occupied territory,"" the Territorial Defence AZOV Dnipro unit posted on Telegram late Thursday.

Ukrainian forces launched the offensive into Kherson from several vantage points to the north last weekend. Since then, there has been little information about the operation, but Ukrainian forces appear to have taken a number of villages in the northern part of Kherson and consolidated a bridgehead across the river Inhulets.

We had thunderstorm here almost the entire day, it masked the sound of shelling pretty much perfectly, which is horrible, because you don’t know when it’s actually dangerous. Many times we thought that it was just thunder, but it turned out to be incoming shelling. Some random street not that far away from me was shelled, but at first we thought that it was just thunder, it sounds almost exactly the same.

Those explosions from yesterday were missile strikes at some school which was used as a shelter for civilians; it killed 1 person and injured a guard. At midnight today there were more missile strikes, apparently they fired 2 missiles at a lumber mill in Bezliudivka, why would they even target it?

Why are they targeting such useless targets with expensive missiles, but then only threaten to hit actually valuable targets? They have been saying that they will hit our “decision making centers” if we do this or that, but then never actually hit them even if we did whatever they said we can’t do.

The steel plant became the last bastion of resistance by Ukrainian forces in the eastern port city, but dozens of badly wounded people were trapped there for weeks.

The pilot, in an interview released by the Ukrainian military, said that there had been a number of flights to deliver badly needed supplies to Azovstal — and in some cases, the crews had received just a few hours notice. 

He said the main difficulty was layers of anti-aircraft defenses.

""There were three different anti-aircraft missile systems that covered the landing area,"" he said, and according to all calculations, the missions should have been impossible.

The pilot, whose identity is disguised during the interview, added that, like President Volodymyr Zelensky said, ""In 90% of cases, everyone understands that they will not come back … But we all realized what was going on there. That people didn't even have medicine there to provide some basic care, there was no ammunition. It was extremely necessary to do it. That is why everyone took this risk.'""

Video of one mission showed views from the helicopter flight deck as the aircraft flew very low over the sea and Mariupol's docks, as well as a brief shot of a helicopter on the ground at the Azovstal plant. 

""At that moment, when we were already in Mariupol, and there was a landing, unloading of people and cargo, there was such a feeling of euphoria,"" the pilot said.

However, the pilot said that three minutes after takeoff on the return journey, his helicopter was hit by a man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS) missile and one engine failed. But he decided against making an emergency landing with 20 wounded on board. ""How to pick them up, how to evacuate them? We would need another helicopter,"" he said.

The pilot said he managed to fly to the designated landing site.

""Unfortunately, the other helicopter behind was less fortunate and the whole crew died,"" he said. ",False,1654181107.0,t3_v309mx,t3_v309mx,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

The MLRS systems should be arriving near the end of June.

All those men Ukraine drafted back in February when the war started should be completing basic training this month (As opposed to the russian model of throwing a hood over a drunk as he comes out of a bar and let him wake up with a 1800's era musket on the front).

The M777 artillery is already making a difference but by the end of June the MLRS and HIMARS will be arriving and it's not just a few systems from the US but the UK is pitching in a few and no doubt Canada too.  And by now we've all seen the thread detailing how [important these are](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1531067601006301184.html).

There's still a few blocks for russia to take to truly claim Severodonetsk but to truly say they own Luhansk they're going to have to take Lysychansk, the city Ukraine is falling back to.  And as they say, Severodonetsk was probably russia's culmination of this war especially since many reports indicate russian conscript's contracts expired at the end of May.

While russia was busy shooting its one shot in the Donbas, Ukraine started an opportunistic counterattack near Kherson and the reporting is following the same lines as the Kharkiv area.  russia fan bois (seriously, were they cheering on the russian raping the infant on twitter?) claim all is fine, all is fine, then suddenly everything turns up roses for Ukraine.

Reports from Thursday said that street fighting continued in Severodonetsk. 

""The Russian army uses all its armed capabilities and does not count people at all. It is especially cynical that in the first line of attacks, the occupiers very often use those people who were recruited into their army in the previously occupied territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,"" Zelensky said, referring to the militia of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

""The longer the war lasts, the more vile, shameful and cynical things Russia will forever write in its history,"" he said. 

Zelensky also addressed the new rockets and munitions that the US will be sending Ukraine.

""The United States has confirmed that modern HIMARS fire missile systems are being sent to our country. These weapons will really help save the lives of our people and protect our land. I am grateful to President Biden, all our American friends, and the people of the United States for their support,"" he added.

-

Even if they take what's left of Luhansk, or even the whole Donbas, then what? They are already running out of vehicles, munitions and are probably at half the manpower they began with.

Ukraine has a clear objective, to restore their territorial integrity. They aren't going to stop fighting until that happens under any realistically possible scenario.


-


Let's say Russia achieves their politically stated objective of annexing the remainder of the Donbas. That isn't a death blow for Ukraine in any way. It's not even a particularly serious loss strategically considering how economically wrecked and depopulated the region already is.


-

Russia has no realistic strategic win condition. Only a political one. Even if they say *""Mission Accomplished! We have taken the Donbas region*"". That doesn't mean Ukraine will just stop fighting.

From CNN's Olga Voitovych and Bex Wright

Senior officials from Ukraine and the United States held a phone call on Wednesday about the new military aid package for Ukraine, according to Andriy Yermak, head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.

“Good news. Today, together with the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi, we had a telephone conversation with the US President's national security adviser Jacob Sullivan and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley,” Yermak said.

“We discussed a new US military aid package for Ukraine, which includes HIMARS MLRS and ammunition, Mi-17 helicopters, Javelin missiles, tactical vehicles, radars and other ammunition,” he said.

“It's important that this is not the last US aid. We told about the needs of our army to win over Russia,” he added.

“We also discussed future surprises that the enemy definitely will not like,” Yermak said.

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov publicly thanked US President Joe Biden and the US military for including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems in the next round of security assistance to Ukraine. In a statement on Wednesday, Biden formally announced the inclusion of the US-made HIMARS as part of the package to Ukraine.

The systems will have a range of about 70 kilometers (44 miles), a US defense official told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday, which is further than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. Ukraine had sought longer-range weapons, but the US resisted due to concerns they would be capable of striking Russian territory, thereby potentially escalating the war.

Y'all have no idea how big a role this could play in breaking the stigma around LGBT people in Ukraine and the improvement of the status of their rights. As a gay man myself who has interacted with homophobes from eastern Europe (including Ukrainians) on the internet I've repeatedly observed this notion prevalent among them that queer people are very self-centererd and cowardly, that they would run away from 'real' responsibilities and never consider giving something back to the society they expect to treat them equally/indifferently. If they're true to their words they won't turn a blind eye to these brave individuals getting out of their comfort zones and literally putting themselves out on the front lines fighting for their country's existence and sovereignty. This might also act like a catalyst and result in the betterment of gay rights in other eastern european countries, who knows.

Also they have their own [military patch](https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20220531&t=2&i=1600682102&w=640&fh=&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=2022-05-31T134104Z_18945_MRPRC27EU9VT9HU_RTRMADP_0_UKRAINE-CRISIS-LGBTQ-DEFENCE) and it looks absolutely badass",False,1654189229.0,t3_v309mx,t3_v309mx,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

I’m not a fan of the military industrial complex in the US, but Russia helped me to gut that particular ideal, at least for now, but I’m also not a fan of how Turkey has been fucking around Finland and Sweden over entrance into NATO.  

That seems like a bad precedent to set, with other countries questioning if similar fates await should they apply.  I would think Turkey would raise its issues prior to them announcing their application but we are where we are.

I understand there may be additional considerations, especially since it seems like the west is working a gradual escalation strategy and idk if or when Reapers fall on that strategy, and I also don’t know the rules related to such a request.

Aiming expensive missiles on non-military targets is a good example.

Their use of cruise missiles has been bizarre.

Ukrainian military says there are no immediate plans for withdrawing forces from Severodonetsk
From Tim Lister and Olga Voitovych
 

Speaking at a briefing in Kyiv, Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff, said, ""Regarding the withdrawal of our troops. At the moment, our troops, which are engaged in the defense of Severodonetsk, do not face such a task. The units will carry out tasks with all the available forces and means, with the available resources.""

Hromov acknowledged that the danger of Severodonetsk falling to the enemy exists. ""In case of the taking of Severodonetsk, we will be forced to defend along the river bank and will also fight from urban areas."" The river Siverskiy Donets runs close to Severodonetsk, dividing it from the nearby city of Lysychansk. 

""The enemy is trying to encircle our troops,"" Hromov said. ""All activities, all actions carried out by both military personnel and units as a whole, consist in the implementation of a single plan. At this time, in the plans of the command, the General Staff, there is no need for our military units to withdraw from the [Severodonetsk] area.""",False,1654191913.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iaxkzfy,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

For all the jesting and mockery what one of the snipers says in the video is true, these are rifles with a lot of lethality and you do not want to be standing in front of it. Plenty of other countries run similarly old designs of action, US have 7.62 bolt action snipers in service still.

There are other candidates for this role of course, the VSS Vintorez and SVD mentioned in the video, or an SKS with the same PU scope. Arguably, for a militia force like this, those are worse choices. These are not random standard production run Mosins, the ones with PU scopes were hand selected in small numbers as rifles which performed to the highest grade in factory trials. In comparison, every alternative is a mass produced rifle with standard Soviet quality control levels. The SKS is a carbine and so is the Vintorez, neither is as accurate in the hands of an unskilled shooter. The SVD is technically a DMR not a sniper, so exchanges absolute accuracy for rate of fire. Of the four, the one I'd give to inexperienced troops and expect the most success with, is still the Mosin. It's quick to learn, easy to shoot, and the bolt action means you get a lot more feedback about where your shots fall versus the destabilising motion of a semi auto rifle. Also a damn sight easier to maintain especially compared to the finicky Vintorez.

On the other hand, it's an 80 year old relic that even the Viet Cong sought more modern alternatives to in a war fifty years ago. Although the likes of the US run 80 year old actions in terms of year of design, they're more recently manufactured receivers and they're sitting in modern, polymer stocks with 2 axis adjustment, bipods, modern optics, and a number of other substantial upgrades.

step one: probably food shortage. what does it lead to? starving people, so you can eat less meat (since a lot of grain goes to feed meat inefficiently) eat foods that are not in shortage, eat proper proportions, drink water instead of soda, etc along those lines so that you aren't contributing as much to the shortage. 

step two : effect of food shortage. prices go up, so buy less new stuff so that people who are struggling more can afford it, repair things if you can, mend clothing as needed, shop thrift stores, do hobbies that are less expensive and/or purchase intensive. 

step two b : use less fuel so that russia profits less overall on their energy. combine trips, get an oil change, pump up your tires, mow less frequently, defer the vacation, etc.

overarching idea...by consuming less you'll have a bigger impact than your small garden would, so turn yourself back into a covid-lockdown hermit for a few months and ukraine and all countries will reap the benefit of you not fighting with millions of others to consume and you'll reap the personal benefit of saving money that you can use later",False,1654183126.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iax12fj,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Here in the USA, we have more than enough food. The issue is shipping. We don't have enough ships to get the food out.

So logistics. Trains, Trucks, and Boats, dock workers, logistics computer programs, etc. etc. Supply chain stuff, business degrees. Of course, those people are hurting because of COVID19. So also add supporting jobs, like nurses and doctors to that.

USA is burying a lot of meat / grain, because our supply chains were so messed up due to COVID19. We have so much excess food rotting away because of inefficient transportation (granted, our country is very large, so its a difficult job, and COVID19 really messed up the entire chain and caused delays to shipping).

TL;DR: Get vaccinated, and hopefully we reduce the disruptions moving forward. Not much we can do about the current set of disruptions, we just gotta prepare for the next COVID19 waves as appropriate.

In terms of losses, if you mean territory, that's fair to say.  You can't ignore there is a directionality to territorial gains in this region.  However Russia's certainly losing more people and equipment.  

The Donbas is superficially one long front, but can be divided into separate arenas and salients, with different levels of fighting and different possibilities for incursions and counterattacks.  Some are stable, some are favoring Russia, some are favoring Ukraine.  

In the area of Severodonetsk/Lysychansk, this is one large metro area across a river boundary.  Russia had a plan to attack the city from both sides of the river, but have only been able to do so consistently from the Luhansk/northeast side.  The Donetsk/southwest side encirclement hasn't been 100% successful and Ukraine may even have corridors still out of the city.  Still, most of the city has been occupied, and it seems likely the outer metro area will be occupied in the near future, but they are paying for slow incremental gains there.  Though it is unlikely they will have to wage a long period of urban warfare to secure it (as was the case in Mariupol), because most of the buildings are already destroyed or damaged, and there's nothing like the enormous steel complex or docking area to bunker down in.  

Further west of this are river towns (including the infamous pontoon fiasco).  Despite many failed attempts to establish bridgeheads here, certain of these towns are now occupied as well.  It's unknown if these bridgeheads have become staging areas or if they're capable of meeting up with forces out of Poposna to achieve a larger encirclement.  

West of this is the Izyum salient, where there is constant heavy fighting and Ukraine has effected some counterattacks.  This may be because Russia pulled units out of Izyum for their offensive on Severodonetsk.  

South of all of this is a long, relatively stable line of defense outside the city of Donetsk.  Ukrainian forces have a secure, entrenched position here, and the lines don't move very much or very often.  It's mainly artillery attacks.  This is the main reason Russian forces have been concentrating on the area north of this, and eventually it will threaten this defense line in the long term.  

Southwest of the Donetsk front both fighting and intel is spotty.  This is the Zaporizhzhia front, heavily wooded, and relatively fluid.  Nobody's best units are here; it's mainly militia and foreign volunteer groups fighting Wagner mercs that left Mariupol.  

North of Izyum is Kharkiv, which isn't so much a front anymore.  There are large areas on the 'Russian side' of the river that Ukraine can't access, but which Russia also hasn't particularly occupied or set up defenses in, and they are only maintaining a handful of towns in Kharkiv itself.  

My two cents is Russia's kind of blown its load in the Donbas at this point and is relying on momentum.  Their gains are going to slow until an equilibrium is reached and they have to become defensive.  How effective that defense is will depend on things like how quickly Ukraine gets heavier weapons, how many new troops Russia can import to the region, how over-extended Russia is when they are forced into that position, to name a few.  For example it's easier to defend Severodonetsk if they stop there and dig in than if they try the larger encirclement they originally wanted.",False,1654163429.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iaw2gfn,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Some evidence:

the Japanese high council (don’t know what it’s called) didn’t even meet after Hiroshima. 3 days passed and there was no discussion of surrender. 

while the effects of a single bomb are obviously awe inspiring, many other much larger cities had already effectively experienced the same destruction due to persistent US bombing and the wooden building techniques. (Tokyo was already devastated by this time.)

on August 8th, the soviets declared war on Japan and mobilized their land forces against the Japanese.

the Japanese had reason to believe that surrendering to the US would be more suitable than to the Soviets as the Soviets were likely to demand more in concessions.  There was also sufficient reason to believe that the US would treat Japan kinder in the post war period (Marshall plan in Germany, Soviet treatment of Nazi POWs)

Did the bombs matter? Of course, but to singularly cite it as THE cause of the end of the war seems very simplistic.",False,1654220814.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iazgx98,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

""In the days leading up to the battle, Napoleon took a huge risk to bluff his opponents. Withdrawing from the Pratzen Heights and Austerlitz itself, he gave up the best defensive ground available to him. Pulling his troops back in a disorderly fashion, he created the impression of an army in retreat. This was reinforced on November 29 when he pretended to be timid and uncertain when meeting with a Russian envoy.

Meanwhile, he was calling up his First Corps under Marshal Bernadotte and his Third Corps under Marshal Davout, both of which marched 60 miles from Vienna to join him.

Napoleon now had troops his opponents had not seen. They had been tricked into thinking Napoleon’s army could be beaten. It led to them advancing from the Pratzen Heights once the battle began, making themselves vulnerable.""

""The Russians forces did have strengths, including good morale and an incredibly powerful cavalry. They also had serious weaknesses. Many of the officers were ineffective. The artillery, although numerous, lacked the range of the French guns. The men were exhausted from three months of marching and lacked some of their battlefield supplies as these had not yet reached Austerlitz."" 

""The Austrians and Russians, each with their separate commanders, did not always coordinate their efforts well. Around midday, the Russian Imperial Guard under Grand Duke Constantine rushed to counter French advances in the weakened center of the allied lines. They ran into withdrawing Austrian troops and the confusion of the two armies disrupted the Russian counter-attack.

This lack of coordination went deeper than simple errors on the day. The command staff of both armies was divided between hawkish commanders who wanted to attack Napoleon and more cautious men. They had squabbled over ten different plans unable to agree on the best approach. Long into the night before the battle, they were still discussing strategy. By then, many were half-asleep, and one key commander was drunk.

There was little hope of any coordination to carry out their plans.""

2. Tanks have 3000 to 4000m range, because their guns are so big and because they have computers controlling the gun. Bigger bullets mean more mass, more mass with (not as big) surface area means less drag proportional to mass, so the bullets go further and more accurately. Fighting an enemy with 3000+meter range when you are armed with 150m ranged rockets is suicide on open grounds.

3. Change the terrain. Ambush the tanks from the houses. If the houses are destroyed, ambush the tanks from the rubble. You can't bomb rubble into more rubble, its all blocking vision regardless. (Tanks can shoot through rubble of course, but they still need to know where enemy troops are, otherwise they're wasting ammunition and just loudly telling all enemies where they are).

4. This leads to a situation where infantry can effectively fight against tanks, **even without** advanced missiles like Javelins or NLAWs.

5. Add in the high-ground in Lysychans'k, and that means Ukrainian tanks can provide direct-fire support from over the river. Not only are Russian tanks looking for threats 150m away from them, they also have to keep an eye across the riverbank for Ukrainian tanks who are blowing them up from long range.

6. Add in Javelins (3000m+ rockets) who can also be sniping tanks from Lysychans'k, and you realize that those tank commanders in Severodontesk have to be looking out for close-range infantry, long-range infantry, and long-range tanks who can all kill them.

6. Add in 20km+ range artillery to this as well, plenty of positions under Ukrainian control where artillery can bombard the area and support from afar.

-------------

The Ukrainians are effectively claiming that they've created a kill zone in Severodontesk. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_zone

I'm not 100% sure if I believe them or if its propaganda, but I can say its at least **plausible**. The big question is the terrain to the north and east of Severodontesk. The ""kill field"" means that enemy soldiers are in an area where they can't get support from their allies, while all of your allies can all converge fire upon one point. Riverbanks, hills, and weird terrain details create these kinds of fields.

None of us have detailed enough maps to actually figure this out. This is in the hands of the local commanders and local scouts.

The United Kingdom will send multiple-launch rocket systems to Ukraine to help defend itself against Russia, British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.

Britain will send M270 launchers able to strike targets up to 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) away, offering “a significant boost in capability for the Ukrainian forces,” according to a statement from the British Foreign Office.

The move has been “coordinated closely” with the United States decision to provide Ukraine with its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) – a variant of the multiple-launch rocket systems that will be gifted by the UK, the statement added.  

“The UK stands with Ukraine and has taken a leading role in supplying its heroic troops with the vital weapons they need to defend their country,” Wallace said.

“As Russian’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine. These highly capable multiple-launch rocket systems will enable our Ukrainian friends to better protect themselves against Russia’s brutal use of long-range artillery, which Putin’s forces have used indiscriminately to flatten cities,” he added.

The British government also said that Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, so the effectiveness of the launchers can be maximized.",False,1654146593.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iavm5qi,,3,23,0,23,0,0,

Its high-risk, high-reward. You see more of the enemy, but more of the enemy sees you. Your sniper can kill a lot of areas, but any of those areas could be shooting you back.

The advantage is about concentrations of forces and consolidating firepower. If you have ""lots of high grounds"", all of which could have snipers / tanks firing upon the enemy, then the enemy has to look at many areas to find their targets, which provides an advantage.

In any case, you can't beat a modern, industrial farmer.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BAQCpUu3ww

USA has plenty of food because we have plenty of high-tech equipment. We've automated farming to an incredible degree.

There's a few crops still done ""by hand"". But you can bet that newer-and-newer machines, and AI-systems, are being invented to turn these last crops into fully automated processes. (Ex: Strawberries are apparently done by hand still. Plenty of research / high-tech computer wizardry going on to try to automate strawberries... who knows, maybe someone solved in in the past year or two?)

Something like 3-farmers can manage dozens of acres of mixed crops thanks to modern inventions like that plant-tape.

2-farmers are all you need to harvest Basil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcG0jVuThfs

EDIT: Not to hate on small farmers at all. But small-farmers grow tastier foods with more care (less food to manage means more care per plant). That kind of thing is good for boutique and high-end restaurants. But if we're talking about shear bulk of ""feeding the world"", USA pretty much has that solved with these machines.

This is physically wrong, that's not how hills work at all.

The entire point of having high ground is having an field artillery and battlefield intelligence advantage from it.

Look: the first thing soldiers do when they reach a position (assuming no immediate combat is happening), is they dig a fighting hole. Because the low-ground provides cover and concealment against your enemy. Bunkers and underground tunnels have their advantages.

High vs low is quite complicated. Low-grounds can conceal numbers and provide ambush opportunities, if the terrain is just right. Its probably more commonplace for high-elevations to provide ample kill zones and support areas, but its not universal to say the least.

Without deeper analysis, a high-ground very well is just a kill-zone controlled by the enemy. Those kinds of high-grounds are worthless to capture, you'll just constantly die because the whole enemy sees you and can concentrate artillery, mortar, sniper, machine-gun, tank fire upon the hilltop. When everyone sees you, everyone can shoot at you. So you gotta be smart about which high-grounds you take. Charging / attacking from a hilltop may not work in today's battlefield. Charging / attacking from a lowgrounds may very well be a better idea.

---------

Now true, high-grounds make it easier for the people on the hill to reinforce people at the bottom of the hill (moving downhill is easier than moving up hill, even in vehicles). But in this case, there's a river splitting them from Severodonetsk. So the Lysychansk Ukrainians cannot effectively reinforce the Severodonetsk Ukrainians.

Furthermore, the Russians cannot directly charge into Lysychansk, because of the river. So the hill-movement / hill-mobility advantages are completely moot.

So evaluating the Ukrainian claim that they've set up a trap... its... very complicated to evaluate. You or I can't really prove it one way or the other, not with our resources (aka: Google Maps for me). High ground vs low ground just isn't ""detailed enough"" to offer any kind of realistic analysis.",1654197169.0,1654196460.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iay08z1,,5,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Enemy would not be able to set up an artillery battery before you spot, fire, redirect, and fire again with your own artillery, of which the enemy would not be able to spot your artillery, because again that's how hills work.

Artillery and mortar are indirect fire systems. They **never** see the enemy in modern combat. If your artillery / mortar can see the enemy, something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.

Modern artillery range is so huge that Lysychansk is **possibly too close** for effective artillery usage. Artillery is a 10km to 20km weapon, not a 5km weapon. There are probably no artillery guns being setup in Lysychansk. At best, you have some mortar systems (who should be setup inside of a forest, fully obscured and concealed from the enemy).

Modern Artillery/Mortar systems don't involve direct eye contact at all.

> > you see more of the enemy, but more of the enemy sees you.

> This is physically wrong, that's not how hills work at all.

Hilltops can be very easily bombed by artillery and/or mortar systems.

Now the **back** of a hill provides huge military advantages, because that obscures vision and makes things complicated. It also makes it more difficult for lower-elevation artillery to hit (the ballistic curve is less accurate at placing shells).

You need proper military maps to figure out these details.

Semiautomatic does require more care than bolt action, but is also orders of magnitude more efficient in rate of fire. Cleaning an automatic rifle is basic infantry training. It has a 20 round interchangeable magazine vs the 5 round internal magazine in the Mosin. They did use clips for it, but those aren't shown in the video that I saw. So they are loading ammo one by one then cycling them manually after every shot. Both rifles use the same 7.62x54 round so you actually have the recoil backward. A bolt action rifle uses all of the gas generated to propel the bullet, while a semiautomatic or automatic uses blowback to load the next round, absorbing energy and reducing recoil. The extra half pound also tones down recoil a bit. If you've ever shot a 26"" pump action shotgun and semi-auto with the same barrel length, it is a very noticeable difference. Now shorten that barrel (and weight) to a 18"" home defense shotgun and again you are seeing a noticeable difference in recoil. It's a bad sign for Russia to be using this weapon to equip their troops since it is very outdated and mass produced to the point that quality suffered.

Mosin can't be clip loaded with the PU scope fitted, it's manual loading of single rounds only. A point for the SVD. You can load all five rounds without cycling in between though, I have no idea what these guys were doing.

I know what you're saying about both rifles, actually the ""bad"" bit of the SVD is not the recoil into your shoulder. It's the forward motion of the bolt cycling the next round home that pulls the rifle away from you and means an inexperienced shooter will lose sight picture, around when the bullet reaches the target. The ""advantage"" of the Mosin, and indeed any other bolt action rifle, is that you can shoot-spot-cycle, and more easily confirm a hit or miss. If you're ""properly"" sniping, that's no issue.

The SVD is first and foremost a DMR, not a sniper. It's set up to be used in a mixed weapons squad, and indeed can be used as a regular battle rifle if needs must, 20 round magazine fed, semi auto, backup open iron sights (under the side mounted PSO scope), it's not as fast firing as an AK but you can use it in places a full fat sniper would be lacking.

I'm agreeing with you that objectively the SVD is a far finer rifle and indeed actually a very good take on the DMR, arguably superior to the US derivatives of the M14 in the same role. It's much less outdated, even today.

However, if you want a rifle to give to old guys with hunting experience, working alone as militia snipers, the Mosin is still the better choice.

If nothing else, cynically, it's a more expendable rifle because one way or another you're never getting whatever you give these guys back.

We can see that red has the ""low-ground"", and blue has the ""high-ground"".

However, we see that red has complete line-of-sight of the entire battlefield, while blue's vision is blocked due to the terrain. (Similar to the ""haha"" fences if you've ever seen those).

In this situation, you'd have a significant advantage attacking and/or defending from the low-grounds. You can hide in multiple areas while approaching the top-of-the-hill (and covering fire can provide you the time needed to reach those advanced positions).

Meanwhile, if blue were to try and attack red, blue would be exposed 100% of the way down the hill, never actually finding cover vs Red.",False,1654207144.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iayhhmf,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Yeah, the **backside** of the hill. Not the top of it. That's not the high-ground giving you the advantage, its the low ground on the back side.

You don't place troops on the top of hills these days.

> But artillery observers do.

And when you have those artillery observers on the top of hills, they don't fire guns, so that its very hard to find them. If they fire a gun, everyone hears then, triangulates their general location... then sees them and the artillery observers are suddenly dying.

We can clearly see that red (low-grounds) has a clear line-of-sight to blue, and blue can also see red.

But more importantly, if a battle were to occur on this hill, Red could observe virtually the entire hill, while blue is blind in his position.

In this circumstance, the low-grounds offer a line of sight advantage.

I know how airburst munitions work though. The idea is that seeing more of the battlefield is better.

Blue can't see into those areas, so blue won't know to shoot into them. (Blue can shoot into the area of course, but someone has to tell blue that enemies are there). In contrast, Red can clearly see into those areas, and can therefore easily pinpoint where to aim such weapons.

Or Red can use laser range-finders to exactly measure the distance to those depressions. Blue however, won't be able to do that. So red's airburst will be precisely calibrated against the hiding spot, while blue cannot do so.

You're telling me that you've always had full vision of the battlefield on the top of a hill? That this scenario has literally never occurred to you?

I'm really finding that hard to believe, frankly.

Look, I can agree that hills are difficult to climb, that charging up hill is obviously more physically exerting, that walking down hill is easier. So if you're physically moving uphill vs downhill, there's an advantage there.

But if we're talking about a firefight where neither side is moving very much (such as Severodontesk, where the line of battle hasn't moved much in 3 weeks), the issue is more of one of lines-of-sights, kill zones, and other issues.

The entire terrain is invisible from the high-ground, and **only** visible from the low grounds. The corkscrew turn is **famous** for being invisible on the approach, because its just the worst kind of hill-drop. But its completely open for the audience to see. Its one of those things that racecar drivers have to practice and execute blindly.

This is a line-of-sight discussion. Apparently you haven't seen how hills work, so I need to start talking about landscape features.

Have **YOU** seen a hill before? Apparently not, if you can't imagine these situations.

EDIT: Anyway, I station 4 tanks inside of the Ha-Ha. You're on the high-ground, so you can't see the tanks. I use the tanks to surprise you. Since I'm on the low-ground, I can see if you're hiding in the Ha-ha should you approach me, so it is only a strategy that benefits the low-ground army.

Because the low-grounds offer more vision in this case (where Ha-ha-style landscapes occur), the low-ground has the defender's advantage in this situation.",1654200998.0,1654200687.0,t3_v309mx,t1_iay9ox2,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The lower-angle of flight on artillery is important, because the high-angle of mortars is what you need to deal with hill-crests, low-grounds, trenches and so forth. Artillery fire can be ""too flat"" (depending on the situation), and trenches and other terrain features can block the shell.

Since we're within 5km, red can fire upon blue, and blue can fire upon red on equal amounts. That's the magic of mortars, and why I keep **correcting you** and emphasize why its important to distinguish between mortar-fire and artillery-fire in this case.

> protected supply line

What the hell? We're talking about a region of battle 10km across. Supply lines just aren't a factor in these small scale engagements.

A hidden ambush zone absolutely can be hiding tanks. Tanks carry 40+ rounds of their main cannon, depending on the model of tank. You can very easily drive upto and around ambush areas.

Once we start talking about the tactics of Severodontesk, we're well into the level of detail where we need extremely detailed contour maps to plan things out. Or .... you know... just trusting the commanders on the ground, cause that's their job.

So notice how there's no los from low to high ground the picture you posted.

Not sure why you keep brining this up when I already state that I'm talking about field artillery, which includes all forms of indirect fire. This is literally a semantics argument.

Good luck getting accurate hits with a forward observer with no los....

You dig mortar into a trench, to make it harder to hit. Or you hide it inside of tree-lines, so that nobody has any kind of line-of-sight to it at all. That's how they're used in practice.

As I've said before, if your mortar or artillery is seen by the enemy, something has gone horribly, **horribly** wrong.

Yes, and Forward Observers are trained to direct fire of artillery via line of sight out to 25km. They use laser and radar range finders, and both laser and radar requires line of sight.

The only rangefinding you can do without los is sound ranging, which is highly inaccurate because speed of sound and the distance the sound travels is constantly changing.

Seems ironic you've spent half the time talking about mortars that are 5km away, which take an average of 20 seconds from fire to target then go to 20km artillery and 2 minutes to target.

>It takes 2 minutes for shells to fly and they're trained to shoot-and-scoot.
