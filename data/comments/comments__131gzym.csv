When Fuminori Tsuchiko arrived in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv last year, he said he wanted to do anything he could to help people following Russia's invasion.  
Moved by the plight of residents forced by Russian shelling to shelter in subway stations, the 75-year-old Japanese national from Tokyo decided to stay.  
For months, he said, he lived in a metro station and worked as a volunteer distributing food in the subway.  
He and a Ukrainian he met in the station have now opened a free cafe in Kharkiv's Saltivka neighborhood - mainly thanks to what he said were donations made by Japanese people via social media.  
""June, July, August, September, October, November, December - (for) seven months I stayed in the metro, underground, sleeping or eating, and together (with) many, many Ukrainian people,"" Tsuchiko said.

Yesterday we reported that the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly had described child deportations from Ukraine to Russia as genocide.

Late last night, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy described this as ""an important political result"".

""This is the first recognition of this fact at the level of such a high international organisation uniting the states of our continent,"" he said in his nightly address.

""Practically speaking, this decision will significantly help our global efforts to bring Russia and its officials, including the head of the terrorist state, to justice for genocide and genocidal policies against Ukraine.

The deportation of Ukrainian children is one of the fully premeditated elements of Russia's attempt to erase the identity of our people, to destroy the very essence of Ukrainians. This is a deliberate crime of genocide committed by Russian officials. This is how it should be qualified both politically and legally.""

Mr Zelenskyy said that all levels of the Ukrainian government would keep working for the return of all deported Ukrainian children and for the ""punishment"" of Russia.

""We know for sure the data of almost 20,000 children who were taken away and dispersed to different regions of the evil state.

""But it is obvious that this is only a part of much larger criminal actions. There may be many more such children.

""Europe and the world have already seen various deportations and attempts to exterminate peoples.

""It is through the Russian example - the accountability of this state and its officials guilty of genocide - that we must show all other potential sources of the same evil that there will never be impunity.

""There will be sentences for genocide. Just as for all other crimes committed by Russia against Ukraine and our people.""

In March, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russia's president Vladimir Putin, accusing him of abducting children from Ukraine.

It also issued a warrant for the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's commissioner for children, on similar allegations.

I understand the purpose of pegging it in general, in combination with good fiscal and monetary policy and international assistance, it helped to stabilize Ukraines economy. I’m more curious why they chose the dollar rather than the euro. I would think they do more trade with the eu than the us. Is there something about the dollar that makes it more beneficial to peg to than the euro for them? Or something about the euro that makes it less beneficial?

Edit: Lots of good answers in the comments, thank you everyone! For anyone stumbling across this, here’s an updated list of possible reasons:

-	USD is a more popular global reserve currency
-	USD is more common in international arms trading
-	While it didn’t happen, there was potential of the Euro being destabilized by the gas crisis
-	The EU and other countries are likely more used to dealing with USD than the US and other countries are with Euros
-	The US may be better able to help Ukraine maintain the peg than the EU is


I’m not sure if any one of these is sufficient to explain why Ukraine chose USD instead of the Euro, but combined (and probably with even more reasons no one has said yet) they do make a compelling argument for USD.

I think it is important to read, as it provides great insight into the specifics of the International Humanitarian Law applicable in the case.

**tl;dr:** The panel concludes that Amnesty International gathered enough information to report that UAF _**might**_ have violated IHL. But it made the claim that UAF _**did**_ violate IHL. A claim, for which AI had no facts to back it up.

Important to note, that the Press Release was the _only_ internal document on the issue. The ""more detailed report"" implied by the AI it could not share to avoid exposing UAF never existed.

There is another type of jet (Swedish Gripen) that would be better because it is equipped for short runways, isn’t fragile to runway debris, and has more modern missile systems.

The two things I would point out for those who aren't tracking it closely...

1. A large chunk of Repubs still support Ukrainian, it is only a small minority that are idiots. However currently these idiots have a lot of power due to small margins in the House. IF the leader of the house isn't an idiot (he's not) and has balls (he doesn't) - it's not an issue.

2. 2024 outside of a unicorn event should at least result in a Democratic Party win in House, that's good for Ukraine. In the Senate it's more likely to be harder to win but Republican Senators appear to be much more pro-Ukraine in general, so that is positive.

Every factor is in favour of Dems winning House and Presidency based on logic, as long as swing voters turn out again to say 'fuck you' to GOPs dumbarsery.

The best ally that Dems have is how GOP keeps introducing or advocating policies with only 30-40% support at best, i.e. anti-abortion rights, culture wars, anti-support for democracy and anti-support for Ukraine. This is probably why GOP did so poorly in the midterms.

The article says that while the presence of Ukrainian forces near civilians was backed in part by facts (note the “in part”), the conclusion that it violated international law was not founded.

“While condemning Amnesty International’s analysis, the review panel agreed that the statement — which had lacked much detail — was backed in part by fact.”

 “Essentially, that means if there are two equally good locations for the military to station itself, one closer to civilians and one farther away, combatants should opt for the latter so that any enemy does not kill civilians as collateral damage. If there is no equally good alternative, a military force should try to evacuate civilians to a safer place. The news release accused Ukraine of a “pattern” of failing to take either step, while also saying it should have warned civilians. 

But the report said Amnesty International “failed to meaningfully engage with Ukrainian authorities” about whether equally good alternative locations, evacuations or warnings were feasible.”

The overall conclusion of the report is that:

“ But the review panel nevertheless unanimously concluded that Amnesty International had botched its statement in several ways and that its key conclusions that Ukraine violated international law were “not sufficiently substantiated” by the available evidence.”

“The overall narrative of the Aug. 4 release was “written in language that was ambiguous, imprecise and in some respects legally questionable,” the report found. “

“But Amnesty International lobbied the panel to soften its tone, and it did so in some respects — like revising its characterization of Amnesty’s conclusion that Ukrainian forces violated international law from “not substantiated” to “not sufficiently substantiated.”

“ The report also said the descriptor “pattern” was imprudent because it implied that generally, “many or most of the civilian victims of the war died as a result of Ukraine’s decision to locate its forces in the vicinity of civilians,” as opposed to “Russia’s willingness to target civilians or civilian objects deliberately or indiscriminately.”",False,1682692619.0,t3_131gzym,t1_ji20jea,,2,39,0,39,0,0,

Many countries of Europe have happy little US bases with a dozen or two quietly squirreled away nukes the US doesn't really talk about much, but doesn't hide either (it's public knowledge).  The agreement being ""we will protect you because NATO--you don't need them"".  Ukraine wasn't part of the club yet.  After this, Ukraine will be, and I would be willing to bet by 2030, Ukraine's part of NATO with a dozen F-35s and US nukes also there by quiet invitation.

Russia and sympathizers go ""omg reee imperialism"" but it's really convenient to have a quick-deploy nuclear deterrent you don't have to maintain that also helps against proliferation as an insurance policy.  Now, this is going to be tinfoil hat time here below, so, feel free to ignore it but:

*I would propose as a possibility, and it's been almost certainly (I just haven't checked but seen comments of it) confirmed, that Ukraine couldn't use the nukes it gave up.  However, I* ***also*** *suspect at least a good percentage of Russia's nuclear stockpile,* ***they too*** *can't use for probably the same reason.  They've* ***never*** *tested an atomic weapon from the Soviet era to my knowledge.  I suspect something ""bricked"" in that time period, and the real stockpile is what's been manufactured, maintained, and actually deployed* ***since***\*--an infinitely smaller amount if anything.\*

This is **total tinfoil hattery and speculation**, I don't even believe it myself and I'm skeptical of their capabilities already, but I do see nothing but evidence indicating it as true, and nothing to disprove it except Russia's bluster and the US's leeway (they have no interest in violent regime change a la '03, or taking the risk of faulty intel).  Ukraine knew it couldn't really use what it had so why keep it, and I would be willing to bet Russia had the same conundrum but went a different route.

Had Ukraine had nukes, and deployed them, Russia would've just responded in kind.  That wouldn't have changed the situation probably--you'd probably have still seen this happen because Putin is an irrational actor.  If Ukraine had launched conventional missiles to kill Putin, that would've ended the war, and nukes would've been irrelevant, for that matter.

There is not.  There are two paragraphs - and they are the most victim-blaming parts of the entire article!

> The Ukrainian military’s practice of locating military objectives within populated areas does not in any way justify indiscriminate Russian attacks.

Only paragraphs 5 and 30-31 are in any way against Russia's indiscriminate attacks on citizens.

Paragraph 24 *alludes* to Russians blowing up 7 schools the Ukrainian military had apparently never been near - but only by saying ""At 22 out of 29 schools visited, Amnesty International researchers [...] found evidence of current or prior military activity [...]""   Of course they do not say what constitutes ""prior military activity"", and they never released any supporting documentation for this article to show what they found where, ie. active or ""past"" use - apparently a single ration package might be enough to say ""the military used this facility"".


At the end of the day, I believe Ukraine had two options.  They could use civilian infrastructure or they could lose the war.  They did use civilian infrastructure, and unfortunately that did make civilian areas military targets.

So this article has a valid *foundation* - Ukraine should do everything they can to avoid putting any military asset near any civilian asset.  But that's not what the article says.  If that was all the article said, Amnesty International wouldn't have followed it up by saying:

At these lengths of time, humans have probably travelled around the world several times.

It hasn’t just been a single migration wave.

For all we know, maybe we are all “out of Australia”.

Having said that, Africa seems the most likely area of origin because it has apes.

On Jan 26th the UK announced theyd deliver challengers at the end of March and training would take place upon delivery. Tank crew training for western battle tanks averages 22 weeks. It's been 4 weeks since the delivery time announced to the press. I'm reasonably sure that 22 weeks is longer than 4 weeks.

That said, UK based training wasn't announced until the end of March when it was completed, giving a two month period of ambiguity on when the tanks would be operational. In late January they said training would begin ""soon"". But it would have had to have been happening already to be done in late March. But at this point this conversation is pedantic. My argument, if you go back to the start of this thread was it wouldnt be surprising if these announcement were intentionally deceptive. Military deception is all about adding ambiguity to your likely operational timeline and objectives to limit the enemy's ability to plan effective responses. I said this could be that. Maybe it's not, maybe it is.
