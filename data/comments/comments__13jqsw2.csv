Day 445-448 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were somewhat quiet, but there was an attempted missile/drone strike aimed at Kharkiv at around the same time as the one that was aimed at Kyiv happened yesterday. There was a single explosion in Kharkiv at 3am yesterday, which wasn’t too loud for us personally, but other people posted videos with an almost deafening sound. 

It was most likely caused by our air defense intercepting either a drone or a missile over the city. No damage to any building was reported afterwards and no fires started anywhere, so whatever it was, it didn’t manage to hit its target. There was also a second missile launch from Belgorod in the evening yesterday, but that one was aimed at something in Kharkiv oblast.

They also launched more cruise missiles from the south and they hit a shopping mall in Mykolaiv with them, another worthy target, missiles well spent. They are definitely extremely mad that Patriot managed to intercept their “invincible” missile, otherwise they wouldn’t be launching so many missiles just to try and destroy it, which only humiliated that missile even further, because more Kinzhals were shot down in the process. 

We are not even sure if any part of the Patriot battery was damaged in the strike, if it was actually hit by a missile then there would be no talk about repairing it, there would be nothing left to repair. All that talk about assessing damage just points to debris from the intercepted missile falling near the system, potentially damaging it. I just hope that no crewmen were hurt/killed, you can easily replace the damaged equipment, but it's much harder to replace trained crews.",False,1684304548.0,t3_13jqsw2,t3_13jqsw2,,0,243,0,243,0,0,
fc87bdb22cb573cd553194bb28c13cb7,13jqsw2,jkh8bqd,"The spokesperson of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Yurii Ihnat, said that the Patriot anti-aircraft missile system cannot be destroyed with one strike, even if it is a Kinzhal missile.

""The result of an anti-aircraft battle may vary. But yesterday we even said: ‘no comments’. We do not comment on the liar Konashenkov, who has destroyed the entire composition of our Air Force eight times over. If we had as many planes as they ""destroyed"", we would have probably won a long time ago.

I want to say: do not worry about the fate of the Patriots. From a technical point of view, Patriot is a complex, a battery, a division, a system, everyone calls it differently and no one can understand what it consists of.""

Ihnat noted that the division is a command post where the combat service crew is stationed, it tracks air targets and receives information about the air situation in its area of ​​responsibility. In this way, it downs air targets.

The system can work in a manual, semi-automatic and automatic mode.

According to the spokesperson of the Air Force, it is the automatic mode of operation of the Patriot that allows it to shoot down air targets without human intervention, as it did last night: ""Automatics [allow for better] speed of making decisions, target detection and use of weapons.""

He added that the system has a radar and up to eight launchers, each equipped with four transport-launch containers, which are located at a distance; they provide rocket launches.

""So, to destroy the system with some kind of Kinzhal – it's impossible. Therefore, let everything they [the Russians – ed.] say remain in their propaganda archive.""

It is not hard to see that Russians apparently do not intend to move further west in that sector and start switching into the defense mode around Bakhmut, trying to cut off the Ukrainian supply lines.

People don't have the physical ability to react so quickly (especially considering that the russians launch missile strikes most often at night), get dressed and run for shelter, which is not always around.

Also, because the missile's flight time is so short, the air defense has no way to shoot it down, at least for now.

The most interesting part to me. From a Russian medic:

*”I have the right to provide first aid to a soldier, but if, for example, I understand that an artery has been severed, I can't just take a scalpel, cut it, clamp the artery, fix it, tie it up and prepare a person for immobilisation. I'm not allowed by law to do that.*

*""If I do that, they will take him to surgery and write a complaint and put me in jail for having performed a surgical intervention without proper authorisation."" He says that this has actually happened to other medics.*

While my disdain for Russia is very high right now, I do hope the regular Russian people can get wind of information like this and do something about it. *Of course, I also don’t want the wounded Russian soldiers to all of the sudden be able to return to battle.* If regular Russian people are still too afraid to complain about this (which is both sad and disappointing), at least make a big stink after Putin, etc. eventually lose power (which will happen).",1684375795.0,1684375047.0,t3_13jqsw2,t1_jkkrl8z,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

However, Ukraine is not stuck to alternating moves like in chess, so it can do a multi pronged approach, similar to a feint. If it succeeds: great.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,13jqsw2,jkk445w,"Sovereignty is not an important value that nation-states care about in a realpolitik situation. Sovereignty is an abstract legal concept that states only care about when they are too weak to defend their own interests, or when they want to protect a smaller state somewhere else on the globe. China does not view sovereignty as an important value because it is gradually becoming a superpower, and superpowers are always able to defend their sovereignty when they care to. China also does not have any important allies with sovereignty interests that they feel the need to protect, so on the whole, the concept has much less value for China as it did, say, 50 years ago.

For superpowers, other nation-states having sovereignty is an inconvenience, as it limits their power projection on weaker states. This is why the US was able to steamroll over Iraq in 2003 despite objections from the international community. At the time of that invasion, America was the world's only superpower, and it decided to prioritize the interests of its political leaders over the sovereignty of Iraq, out of the knowledge that nobody else on Earth could really do anything to stop it. We continue to witness the damage this did to the national order well into the 2020s today, because it has enabled America's rivals to accuse the US of hypocrisy and dishonesty every time the US trots out ""sovereign rights"" as a basis to object to something else Russia or China are doing.

Part of the whole reason Russia and China are aligning this decade is because they are hoping to weaken the power of the West to protect the sovereignty of Russian and Chinese neighbors. Sovereignty for Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, Finland, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and others is all counter to the interests of Russia and China at present. They will give lip service to the term when it helps their public image, but nobody (in the West or in these rival powers) actually believes that it's a genuinely important concept for Russian or Chinese leaders.

There are ways to appeal to Chinese leaders, but any legitimate appeal has to be rooted in a clear benefit to the interests of China. They will continue to change their policy (both their actual policy and their public-facing views) on Ukraine, but those changes will always be guided by how the new change is calculated to improve their public image or their power. Nothing else is going to work to persuade China on how to handle Ukraine. If they sense that aiding Ukraine will help China, then they will do that. If they sense that hurting Ukraine will help China or damage the ability of the West to safeguard Chinese neighbors, then they will eagerly do that.

In the same vein, it's important not to pay too much attention to anything China *says* about Ukraine. What matters is what they do. Their public-facing, expressed view on Ukraine can be entirely different from their private opinions on Ukraine, and is often at odds with what they actually *do* about the crisis. What they say to Kuleba is less important than their actual actions on important things like Russian trade, Russian aid, and Russian investment.

Sometimes China will lie and say they are taking Ukraine's side, while secretly donating crucial trade goods to Russia. Other times they will take Russia's side and saber rattle about the evil West, while privately threatening Russia and pressuring Russia to scale back its behavior. Just like Ukraine, China only likes working with Russia when it (a) improves China's public image, or (b) improves China's bottom line to do so.",1684362179.0,1684361219.0,t3_13jqsw2,t1_jkk1isb,,1,34,0,34,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Of course this is pretty incompatible with Russia who is claiming to recognize the LPR and DNR as independent countries. 

Right now China doesn't recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea nor do they recognize the DNR or LPR or their subsequent annexation. At the same time they're not going out of their way to defend the notion of sovereignty even though it's something they talk a lot about.

HIMARS was provided last summer when Ukraine was being horribly outmatched by Russian artillery.  It allowed the Ukrainian army to strike ammo depots, disrupting Russian logistics and evening the artillery fight.  It also has a relatively short range that prevents it from striking targets deep within Russia.

Patriot was supplied early this year when Ukraine was having their anti-air missile stocks rapidly depleted.  It is an inherently defensive weapon, with no strike capability.

The stated reason for ATACMS not being provided is that it could be used to strike targets deep within Russia.  I don't find that to be convincing, because even basic HIMARS rockets could be launched from near the border at places like Belgorod.  The true reason why ATACMS has not been supplied is only known by top decision makers in the White House and Pentagon, but I suspect that it is being held back as a hedge against Iranian ballistic missiles.

Ukraine relies on aging Soviet era MiG-29 and Su-27 fighters and Su-24 and Su-25 ground attack aircraft.

Now not to forget the corruption and incompetence present in the Russian Ministry of Defense but Wagner does not have the training capability, technical specialists and depth in numbers the MoD has. Wagner as an organization are not capable of doing even the poor job that the MoD does.

What's more Putin, like Hitler, likes to have different factions vying for his favor as a means of control and to keep them fighting amongst each other instead of threatening his power. He also likes to have multiple groups/people to blame when things go wrong. Not only would giving control of any part of the MoD to Wagner end up making a bunch of officers in the army furious at Putin, not great when tensions over the war are already brewing, but then if Wagner screws it up there is now no one to blame but Putin for putting them in charge.

The fighting between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense is allowed to continue so that when the war goes sideways Putin can take his pick and blame one of them for the failure. Having Wagner in total control means les options for Putin. Plus Putin does still have to manage his inner circle of oligarchs and power players in the government and the MoD, Prigozhin is and outsider in that club, giving him more power would be likely to piss off Putin's allies.

As someone who read his books, that's some great alternative history fiction, but his predictions and analyses are way off the path.

When you see him on stage, he has a favorite bit. Holds up his iPhone and says ""this is the last iPhone."" Meaning Apple won't be able to make new iPhones because ruzzia will do this, and China will do that, and whatever. He's been doing this since right after the war started last year, and he stopped doing it recently when he figured out this won't happen.

He predicted ruzzia will win, but he couldn't substantiate his claims, so he found refuge in ""because they have nukes. A nuclear power can't lose a war."" Forgetting Afghanistan. And other misses ruzzia has had, like the Chechen war #1.

All of Zeihan's talks and books end up the same way: ""the rest of the world will burn, but the US will be the only country that will be more than fine.""

That's his shtick.

He's more of a stand up comedian than someone anyone should be taking seriously.

He's also one of the brave men out there that didn't think companies will leave China, which I have news for him, even Apple is fleeing China.

China cares IMMENSELY about sovereignty. Their entire claim to Taiwan rests on the notion that the island is part of China and so outside interference is a violation of Chinese sovereignty. This is why to them a declaration of independence by Taiwan is tantamount to a declaration of war.

If this was true why doesn't the US roll tanks into Ottawa every time there is a border dispute? How come Luxembourg is allowed to exist despite being next to major powers? How come Japan, with the third largest economy in the world, isn't invading smaller nations in the 21st century.

That's not to say it's always upheld by the west (Iraq comes to mind) but it's not just a buzzword either but a core part of the way countries function. 

And fundamentally this is the issue with ""Realpolitik."" Countries aren't monolithic, values matter, history matters and different ways of looking at the world matter.

Well written and said.

I deeply believe China would have preferred Russia win the war and defiantly keeps territory despite international condemnation. 

A strong Russia kept the west's attention on eastern Europe; a weakened Russia will draw the collective ire of the west upon China should they escalate their bullshit.

Putin has basically forced Xi to go at it alone moving forward -- it's not a comfortable situation. Thus, wrapping it up with Russia intact as much as possibe is now in their interest.

As for concerns of their public image, I suspect they're only restrained by that insomuch as the scenario deems it beneficial. They'll likely abandon it and pull the same shit as Russia in the security council when they're prepared to make a move.

George Keats had trained 20 years for this moment. He had mastered the Russian language in its native accent. He learned all of Russia's customs and social graces. He memorized Moscow streetmaps and knew every back-alley there was. He swore that he could even think like a Russian.

The big day finally came, and he was parachuted to the outskirts of Moscow at night. He emerged by daybreak, and hopped onto a bus going to the city center.

""Comrade. How much for a ticket to Red square?"", he asked the conductor in authentic Russian.

""5 Rubles, Comrade American"", came the reply.

Keats was stunned. Perhaps the conductor was just being a smart-ass. He hopped off the bus and asked a passerby for directions to the closest bar.

""It's just around the block, Comrade American.""

Keats' doubts grew immensely. Not knowing what to do, he went inside the bar and ordered a glass of Vodka.

""Want some Borscht to go with it, Comrade American?"", the bartender asked.

Keats threw a fit. ""What's the matter with you people? I dress just like you, I speak just like you, I even THINK just like you! Why does everyone keep calling me American?""

In all those cases what Ukraine is reporting as ""Russian loses"" was within 5% of Russian metric of ""KIA, MIA and taken PoW"". Now ""KIA"" in Russian terms is a person that was killed in military action, his death is confirmed and body is buried/in the process of burial. PoW is self explanatory. MIA is everyone that's not accounted for, it's not PoW and wasn't KIA. I stopped tracking it a while ago, but only about 30% are reported as KIA. Person that was killed during battle, but his body wasn't recovered is still MIA. Careful estimate says that 85% of those MIA are dead. Only 5% of soldiers were surrendering. So with such data we have (considering today report of 200k Ru loses):

- 60k KIA
- 130k MIA, of which 110k would be KIA
- 10k PoW. 

Which actually is pretty close to the RU public estimates (67k KIA).

About wounded. Again we had a few glimpses during the war. Because of Wagner actions it's around 2. So for each person in metric ""KIA, MIA, PoW"", you will have around 2 wounded (actually it's closer to 2,05 by different estimates, but for the case of simplicity, let's round it to 2. So we have 400k wounded. But how exactly does it impact Russian military? Is a paper cut a wound? Wounded are considered people that said they were wounded and/or needed medical attention. And we have another beautiful metrics in Russia - percentage of wounded that were able to return to active service in 6 months or less. That number is 60%. So it means that 160k soldiers didn't return to service after 6 months after receiving a wound. Of those numbers most will never return to the front line. Statistics here are cloudy, but only 5% do.

So total Russian loses to this day would be:
- 60k confirmed KIA
- 110k MIA that are actually dead
- 150k wounded that won't return to front lines

Also Russian ground forces reporting they have 395k soldiers (or spaces in units). Of which - by the command of group South - almost 360k are involved in war with Ukraine. Wagner had 70k, now is down to less than 20k. So you are pretty close - out of 430k soldiers involved in RU -UA war 320k will never return to front lines.

Guys like Patrushev and Bortnikov aren't talked about enough and I fear they'll come out the other side of this war largely unscathed because they stay in the shadows. 

The West needs to treat the FSB no differently to the NSDAP or the SS, and demand its senior leadership face trials as well.

Something new, something completely culturally different in the western portion down the line, maybe, but not a full-sized Mongol empire style shitshow that still calls itself Russia. Nordstream and sanctions-relief negotiations prior to the war demonstrate that Russia will take the whole fucking arm if you offer a fingernail. Carrots and sticks do nothing to change Russian behavior.

The northern and steppe wastes have always been home to decentralised and more self-sufficient (a hard life, but at least surviving), technologically backward entities that were historically hard for settled, developed societies to deal with (until gunpowder weapons kicked them in the teeth). Russia is the continuation of this trend, but instead of the usual marauder taking on traits of the settled societies and eventually getting Islamised or Sinicised, the reverse happened in Russia, as their elites chose to side with and become enforcers of Mongol rule. They ended up taking on those political traits in future years and have become the new marauders on the marches.

These entities by their very nature, cannot be reasoned with the same way a nation state can be. They are built on layers of loyalties and fealty based on intimidation and violence. The only way you get your stuff back from a Mongol horde is to schwack them in a smash and grab with a technologically superior and more informed, maneuverable forces and get the fuck out. You start to park up and try to form a settled society by force over them, and then you end up in an Afghanistan quagmire. Some political entities and organisations are just so fundamentally different that the same levers of influence just do not work.

With Russia to comply you'd need to basically have a gun to the heads of each and every little micro-fiefdom chief in so many different institutions and places at the same time and enforcing compliance with any kind of peace deal. Thus, short of full occupation and dismantlement a-la Germany 1945 combined with some magical powers to get past the fact that you'll probably get an Afghanistan style resistance from violent ultranationalists, the facist brainrot can't be pulled out, roots and all, and the current proposals do not account for this reality.",1684366374.0,1684366170.0,t3_13jqsw2,t1_jkhz08m,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Their website said something to the effect of ""Hey man, you may have smoked a doobie back in high school, but that's cool."" It was ridiculous. The Trump years became a clown show, f/ex: Putin and NK.

The FBI would often recruit directly from law schools. They had a reputation as being arrogant. Asking reasonable questions such as ""Where would I live?"" was seen as a weakness.

We certainly threw money at this problem. It's just a really difficult problem to solve. Countermeasures for weapons that go into space are way more advanced and expensive than the space re-entry missiles themselves. You can easily counter the counter-measures simply by throwing even more missiles and cheap decoy missiles into space, and you can completely screw the countermeasures over by releasing reflective metal chaff into low orbit during a missile launch, which would completely blind sensors on the countermeasures.

Then you believe in the ability of the United States government to keep a lid on a conspiracy involving tens of thousands of scientists, engineers, military leaders, military grunts, civilian contractors, and civilian space enthusiasts and academics, for more than 40 straight years, and not even one of them has ever turned coat for a dollar or gone to the public because of a crisis on any of the technology or planning teams, and no civilian observer has ever seen any evidence for it.

By the time I read the books, alot of it was already outdated, and in other words wrong. However, like I said, I appreciated his insight and found it thought provoking. 

If I am analyzing his analysis I would say this. He knew more than most that the world was headed for major changes and that they would not be positive. He was certain that they were coming, and that they would be rooted mostly in geography, resources, and demographics. Those changes are in fact happening. Many countries do stare into demographic oblivion and some of the most affected are trying to remedy it in outwardly visible ways. Competition for resources is increasing and that factors into geography. Climate change will only exacerbate that competition. With that competition comes increased risk of conflict. Long standing geopolitical rivalries would seek to complicate matters. That is admittedly low hanging fruit. How those changes and dynamics manifest themselves isnt something that can be predicted I am afraid. Think of all the predictions made this time last year about the war in Ukraine. What seemed logical then is no more.

Leaders in charge at the time decide that, by evaluating costs and benefits within the political constraints of what their power base will reward or tolerate.

For instance, America doesn't act belligerent towards Canada because it wouldn't help its interests (as defined by its leaders and the power base of those leaders) to do so. Canada is already diplomatically and economically aligned with the US, and the relationship is prosperous for the US. If we wanted to take land from Canada, we would have to throw that prosperity by the wayside and deal with international backlash costs that outweigh the benefits of the land.

The same cannot be said for Cuba and a number of other Latin American countries whose sovereignty we have violated right and left. It may well have been an incorrect calculus of America's interests to invade and then embargo Cuba, but for better or worse our leaders have decided this is the best course.

This is a big part of why Latin American countries, India and most of Africa don't especially care about Ukraine. Their sovereignty never mattered much when they had disagreements with the West's 20th and 21st century world orders, so they aren't especially concerned about the violations of Ukraine's sovereignty now.

You are correct to point out that China will weaponize defensive sovereignty postures on places like Taiwan, but this doesn't mean China actually values sovereignty as its own abstract concept.

And there are only two beaches on all of Taiwan where a large scale landing like that would be feasible and one of them is on the side of the island facing away from mainland China.

And sure China could build more amphibious landing craft but that would be obvious to anyone undertaking surveillance of Chinese ship building facilities, so you'd see it years ahead of time.

And even if you ignored the ship building then when China assembled their invasion fleet on the coast you'd probably have weeks if not months of warning. Lots of time for Taiwan to call up it's 300,000 combat ready reservists to bolster its 188,000 strong standing army as well as put the other 2 million reservists with only rudimentary combat training to good use driving supply trucks and doing other support jobs. You could probably even do some refresher training in there.

So assuming Taiwan was only fighting with the numbers they had today would 130,000 Chinese troops landing the first day even be enough?

It makes sense that Europe did recover considering the efforts of the US and others. He operated on premise that the US wouldn't really care.

Fertilizer, food security, market disruptions, are all things still in progress. There is plenty of concern about it.
