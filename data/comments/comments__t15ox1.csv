Day 2 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous update can be found at the link above. It has been snowing almost non-stop since morning here, not sure if it‚Äôs for better or worse.

Yesterday explosions stopped around 23:30 and after that the night was mostly peaceful, there was another explosion around 07:00, after that there was some time without shelling. And right at the time of posting intense sound of explosions can be heard all over neighborhood. Apparently tanks are nearby not sure whose they are, but people are panicking.

Around 11:00 there was an absolutely massive sound of explosions or something of the sort, from reports it could have been the destruction of a couple Russian forces‚Äô ‚ÄúGrads‚Äù, during it the whole street was trembling along with my apartment building and that continued for around 30 seconds. And I did catch the sound on video, but for security reasons I won‚Äôt be posting it, at least for now.

My family and I have been in touch with a lot of our friends from Kharkiv and after talking today got some more news from them. One of my family‚Äôs friends from Northern Saltivka said that it‚Äôs almost like a battlefield over there and that very close to their home there‚Äôs 4 destroyed Russian tanks, which are still on fire, so much for that 0 casualties during the conflict, right?

Another of my friends from Northern Saltivka, my groupmate from university confirmed that shelling did indeed hit one of the apartment complexes and that there are people that are injured or worse.

And to think we were just in the process of moving to the Northern Saltivka, it‚Äôs as if by fate we weren‚Äôt able to find a buyer for our apartment and didn‚Äôt move there before the war started.
From the reports there are intense fights around Derhachi, from where the explosions I‚Äôve been hearing all this time might be coming from.

From talking to our family and friends from Russia we‚Äôre still honestly in disbelief about what they are saying. One of them said, completely serious ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy should I trust your word instead of Putin‚Äôs? You are being fed propaganda, Russian army isn‚Äôt shelling civilians, that is Ukrainians army doing‚Äù That was after we told them that there are explosions all the time, there were even explosions during the call, and they still said they don‚Äôt even want to hear it. What. The. Fuck. We were honestly enraged about it, they would rather believe Putin than their own family getting bombed.

And pretty much everyone else from Russia we talked with has the same stance. They even have the same canned response literally everyone we spoke to used it ‚Äì ‚ÄúEverything will be alright, they won‚Äôt touch the civilians‚Äù. Yeah, right, you definitely know that better than someone actually living under the shelling. You better go tell it personally to all the civilians that were already killed by them, oh wait, you can‚Äôt.

What they probably mean is that their missiles are named ‚ÄúEverything will be alright‚Äù, and their tanks that are running over civilian cars are called ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt touch the civilians‚Äù. I mean what else could that mean?

If we didn‚Äôt know them personally we would think that they were Russian bots, but we DO know them, it‚Äôs honestly just unbelievable, is their brainwashing really that strong that they actually think they are liberating us from nazis and that no civilians are being harmed? Why do they believe words from Putin over their own family?

UPDATE. 17:30
Right now there's rumors of aerial bombardment in Kharkiv. People are turning off the lights in their homes, streets are almost empty. This is really scary, we are also getting bombarded by Grads right now.

I think Putin will face much more resistance at home than he thought, also...This isn't the 1960s. The Russian people have much more exposure to outside thought than they did during the height of the Soviet Union. They are online. They are able to access and consume media from the West through VPNs, etc. Many have traveled throughout the world.

Full annexation. Obviously that's not realistic. It would require way too much manpower, it would crush Russia economically, the sanctions would be crippling long term.

Puppet state, partial annexation. Would be very difficult to keep the puppet government loyal, would require military presence. West wouldn't accept it as legitimate, Ukrainians would resists, sanctions would remain. Again, not realistic in the long run. At least they get some territory.

Puppet state without annexation. What was even the point? One regime change in Ukraine and it's all for nothing. Sanctions would probably remain. Not worth it. Ukraine still hates you.

Losing the war. Would be catastrophic for Putin, but won't happen. 

Backing out. Obviously this won't happen.

Initially sent to partake in joint military exercises until Feb. 20, the estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus will now stay indefinitely. This further pressured Ukraine to be more aware of its borders, as the country‚Äôs capital Kyiv is only around 150 km from the Belarusian border.

2. China

China has refused to call Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine an ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù

Assistant Foreign Minister, Hua Chunying, has refused to give ayes or no answer on the topic, rather has chosen to blame the U.S. and claims Biden fuelled the fire during the initial conflict.

3. Iran

Iran lays blame on the presence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO ‚Äî a Western security alliance ‚Äî in the region. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, said the crisis is ‚Äúrooted in NATO‚Äôs provocations.‚Äù

4. North Korea

North Korea‚Äôs Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un, known for his authoritarian state, weighed in on the Russian invasion. He demanded the U.S. cease its, ‚Äúhostile policy for isolating and weakening,‚Äù Russia.

The North Korean Foreign Ministry also called the 3,000 U.S. troop deployments in Germany, Poland and Romania, ‚Äúa serious security concern.‚Äù

5. Syria

Hours after Putin had announced recognizing Luhansk People‚Äôs Republic and Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic as independent states, Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad made a statement in agreement.

6. Venezuela

Earlier in February, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the country would have ‚Äúpowerful military co-operation‚Äù with Russia. The two countries have close relations.

‚ÄúVenezuela announces its full support to President Vladimir Putin in the defence of peace in Russia,‚Äù Maduro said at a news conference Tuesday.

7. Nicaragua

Nicaragua‚Äôs President Daniel Ortega was one of the first world leaders to voice support of Russia. On Monday, he blamed Ukraine for inciting the war by looking for NATO membership. ‚ÄúThat explains why Russia is acting like this. Russia is simply defending itself,‚Äù Ortega said.

Other countries, who are known to be Russian allies, have yet to take a stance on the conflict. This includes countries in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) with Russia such as Armenia and Kazakhstan.",False,1645802675.0,t3_t15ox1,t3_t15ox1,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

- Giuliani just gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics. 

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting or voting for Republicans or some 3rs party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties)

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia.

If one of those ""ingredients"" is something true, that's fine, but it's also unimportant. The end result is what matters to the propagandist, not whether or not anything they've said is truthful.

Putin is trying to paint someone who we all know isn't a Nazi as a Nazi, because he knows there's a worldwide, negative reaction to Nazis. If that doesn't stick, he'll try something else. He'll hurl every single insult he can think of, regardless of any relationship to reality or lack thereof for the accusation. Because the details don't matter, it's all about the end goal of muddying the waters and exhausting his opposition.

The best thing anyone can do to counter it is to quite literally ignore anything - **anything** - he says, true or false, because the truth is immaterial. Only his goals matter, and we know his goals are evil.

You can do the math. 

Couple of things to add:

Low altitude high speed burns the most fuel. Dense air requires fuel to air mixture to be high, additionally, dense air = more drag. Higher altitudes, the inverse is true. Less air = less drag, less fuel/air mixture.

If intercept aircraft are refueling at those tankers (imo unlikely) their fuel wouldn't last long. If survey aircraft are, they'd last a lot longer.

They have been in a slow decline in this score over the last decade. They now arguably have a leader that cares more about them than they had in 2010 but it's not a very democratic system.

So, while Tucker Carlson is one of the biggest shitheads on earth, the statement that Ukraine is not a true democracy is pretty academically sound. No one considers them a true democracy.

They scored a 5.88/10 on civil liberties, 5/10 on political choices/culture, 7/10 on ability to participate in voting without obstruction, 2/10 on function of government, and 7/10 on pluralism.

Now, back to the main subject. In this conflict (atleast from the viewpoint of a Croatian) the US have far less influence than Germany and France who are leading the EU.

You say we could push him out easily, but Putin doesn't really strike me as the kind of dictator that would go out with a whimper. Getting curb stomped by Ukraine and the west would be a political death for him.

So far we haven't seen much evidence of Russia just indiscriminately bombing civilian centers, and hopefully this doesn't happen. If we decided to send in a bunch of allied troops I suspect the situation would quickly change. If the Ukrainian military does get overwhelmed (which is almost certain) then the war will go into the insurgency phase which is the Achilles heel of modern conventional military achieving any semblance of victory.

Russia was piling troops at the border and had a long list of demands for NATO, Ukraine, and the EU, with ""or else"" being implied by the troops. But the other sides didn't back down. They didn't give a single inch on to Putin's demands.

So now Putin is in a hard spot. He's all but said that he'd invade unless he got what he wanted, and he didn't get that. If he pulled back it would all but kill his reputation as a threat and a country to be worried about, so he invaded and probably is hoping that he can sue for peace after some fighting.

Evidence to support this includes a captured Russian battalion which said that they didn't actually expect to start fighting, just gather information.

The second is Putin's press conference where he starts the attack. Putin is always very calm, clear and controlled whenever he speaks publicly (owning the news stations helps). But this conference was all over the place and borderline unintelligible, which implies that he was on a back foot when he made it. That and a whole bunch of his own officials came out and disavowed the attack afterwards.

So he's either winging it, or he's been staging out exactly what he was going to do for months and is doing it. But either way, not even Ukraine thought that he would actually attack, because we all know that the West is going to sanction Russia to the eyeballs and funnel an endless stream of weapons into Ukraine until this is all over.",False,1645804592.0,t3_t15ox1,t1_hye3kx6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Everyone who says ""Putin can do what he wants! He has nukes! Don't make waves and give him whatever he wants!"" seem to forget that Russia isn't the only country with a nuclear arsenal, and those countries would launch all of them at Russia in retaliation if Russia did use a nuclear weapon.

You see, Putin and his oligarch buddies rather like being alive. They've done most of their best evil stuff, and earned nearly all of their money, while being alive. But having dozens of 500 kiloton warheads detonate in their cities and over their bunkers would tend to hamper their ability to stay alive, to say nothing of their ability to actually spend money, do evil, and be comfortable. They don't want that...

Unless Russia itself is threatened and Putin is looking at NATO troops through the window of the Kremlin, he stands to gain nothing, and lose literally everything, by using nuclear weapons.

I am so happy for that at least my country (Hungary) besides usually having a strong anti immigrant policy put many troops next to the Hungarian-Ukrainian border to help people coming in to find shelters and ensure their safely. As a cat owner I was relieved too that they abolished the policy that only chipped and documented pets can travel, and they are letting everyone with any kind of pets bringing their furry friend too. Also thousands of Hungarians volunteered to adopt any lost pets, or left behind pets near the border. There is a civil organisation for that too working with Ukrainians to bring any lost pet into Hungary.
