Day 53 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Shelling of residential districts continues, today they killed 5 more civilians and wounded 20, so much senseless death. It’s alright in my area, here we still pretty much exclusively hear our own artillery and MLRSs and very rarely incoming shelling.

People here are angry when our government says that we are ready to fight for 10 more years and understandably so. It’s easy to say that we are ready to fight when you are sitting somewhere in Kyiv or western Ukraine where there’s pretty much no danger and life is normal, but here in Kharkiv we have been living under constant shelling since day one and life pretty much stopped. 

A lot of people still live here, but most of them can’t work, no way to get money as financial help is only for the people that flee from their homes. If active conflict goes on for years people simply won’t survive and most of those that are still living here won’t leave either unless they absolutely have to. 

It’s a difficult situation, we can’t just cede our territory, but living under shelling for many years isn’t an option either, the only hope is that the war will end in the coming months. The current counter offensives around Izyum seem promising. This might be the repeat of the situation around Kyiv with Russians being encircled and then retreating. There are more than 20000 of them here, so if they get cut off their losses will be catastrophic, and that just might happen in the coming week.

I know why. I mean, I'm Lithuanian. We've hated the Russians since the early 1900's and for good reason. Then in 1940 we got ""assimilated"" into the soviet union by force. Thousands of people that were making Lithuania a good place to live back then were rounded up and shipped in cattle trains to Siberia to die, including some of my relatives.

In 1988, we, with our brothers and sisters in Latvia and Estonia formed the Baltic way. A literal chain of people, holding hands, all the way from the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, through the capital of Latvia, Riga, to the capital of Estonia, Tallinn. A 600km chain, consisting of 2 million people holding hands, showing the fucking Russians that we are not their fucking land. 

Then, in 1990, we became the first ones to say fuck you to the soviets, to declare independence, followed shortly by our siblings of the Baltics. The immediate response of the Russians was to try and destroy the idea. They tried to take over every news source. In 1991, January 13th, thousands of people, civilians, stood defense of our national buildings, our TV tower. As soviet tanks rolled in, people stood in front of them, trying to push them back, even as the people ahead of them got crushed under the tracks.

Immediately we tried to join the west. We obviously had work to do, but our countries were committed to the transformation. In 2004 all of us joined EU together. Since then, the Baltic nations have become the most prosperous parts of the former soviet union.

And throughout all of it, we have always told our western allies that Russia is a country of murderers. A country of sycophants and dictatorial enablers. Every week, numerous Russian channels that were broadcasted in our nations aired ""talk shows"" that claimed us as Russian land, saying that we have no right to exist. And as we said that to our western allies, our calls fell on deaf ears.

And here we are now. Ukraine, another country that shared our fate, another country that broke free from the Russians, that broke free from Russian puppets, another country that just wanted safety and prosperity for their people, is currently getting attacked and bombed. And the west finally listens. And I'm definitely happy that the west listens. I know that every day there's numerous stories coming from the west, talking about other parts of the west and how they're not doing enough. I guess that's just the nature of people. But I don't care, I'm just fucking glad that the west is finally listening. And despite what those articles say, the west is actually helping. A lot.

The old saying was that world War 2 was won with American steel, British intelligence and Russian Blood. This war will be won by western steel, western intelligence and Ukrainian blood. And I will fight and I will hope for the Ukrainians to not be forgotten in this. I will fight for Ukrainians to be built up just like we were once upon a time.

And yeah. I'm angry today. I'm angry that Russia did this. I'm angry that our western allies didn't listen to us sooner. Hell, I'm angry that Russia fucking exists. And I'm angry as fuck that our Ukrainian siblings are paying for it.

But I'm happy because I know that Russia will die. They will die as an empire, they will die as a country, and hopefully, eventually, they will die as an idea. Just like the soviets did.",1650665218.0,1650231419.0,t3_u5gz0u,t3_u5gz0u,,0,300,0,300,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

From CNN's Tim Lister and Julia Kesaieva

Russia's Ministry of Defense on Sunday threatened the ""elimination"" of resistance soldiers still fighting in the besieged southwestern Ukraine city of Mariupol as it confirmed that an ultimatum demanding their surrender had been ignored.

In a statement, it said that Ukrainian soldiers surrounded in a gigantic steelworks in the city had been urged ""to voluntarily lay down arms and surrender in order to save their lives.""

""However, the Kiev nationalist regime, according to the radio intercept, forbade negotiations about surrendering,"" the ministry claimed.

The ministry also asserted that according to Ukrainian soldiers who had previously surrendered ""there are up to 400 foreign mercenaries who joined the Ukrainian forces"" trapped at the steel plant, including, it said, Europeans and Canadians.

""In case of further resistance, all of them will be eliminated,"" it said.

The Defense Ministry claimed that dozens of military facilities in eastern Ukraine had been destroyed in the latest Russian attacks. These included fuel and ammunition depots, the ministry said, around Severodonetsk, Kremmina and other towns in Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

""Production of Russian SAMs on pause, factory workers are sent on vacation or to war

April 17, 2022
Production facilities of Ulyanovsk Mechanical Plant (JSC UMZ, Ulyanovsk) have actually been shut down. UMZ is a manufacturer of short-range and medium-range radar systems and air defense equipment for the ground forces of the Russian Armed Forces (SAM Buk, SAM Kub, ZRK Tunguska).

The reasons for the critical state of production - the use of a large number of components and electronic components in the manufacture of military products. Until recently, the main supplier of the Russian military-industrial complex was Germany. But with the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, any cooperation was stopped.

According to employees, the plant is unable to continue production on its own, because ""almost nothing Russian"" is used during the technological process.

Currently, the plant's management is looking for opportunities to circumvent sanctions and establish supplies through third countries (including Kazakhstan). But such schemes lead to a significant increase in the cost of components due to the need to pay for services to intermediary countries. But this is not provided by the budget and there is no possibility to increase it.

Workers are given a choice: go on unpaid leave or sign a contract with the armed forces to take part in the war in Ukraine. Recommended position - ""operator-gunner"" SAM ""Buk"". The proposed salary is 50,000 rubles a month.""

From CNN's Tim Lister and Julia Kesaieva

The Ukrainian armed forces said Sunday that as Russia continues to prepare reinforcements for an offensive in the east, its troops are facing supply problems.

In a statement posted on Facebook, the Ukrainian armed forces claimed that ""the Russian military is constantly complaining about the lack of rotation, equipment that is constantly failing, the quality of food and fuel supplied.""

Ukraine reported relatively little combat overnight but said that Russia continued to launch air strikes on Mariupol, where Ukrainian units surrounded in a steel plant are still putting up resistance.

The armed forces also asserted that in areas under Russian occupation ""looting and violence by the Russian military against the civilian population continues. These actions are encouraged by their military command.""

Ukraine's Joint Forces Operation, which is responsible for military action in the east, said 10 attacks by Russian troops had been repulsed Saturday, and that 15 Russian tanks and other equipment had been destroyed.

Some Russian shelling continued into the night, according to regional authorities. 

Serhii Haidai, head of Luhansk Regional Military Administration, said four high-rise buildings in the city of Severodonetsk were hit and caught fire. He provided no details on casualties.

Haidai has previously estimated that 70% of the city is already destroyed.

""There is almost nothing to destroy there. The enemy have destroyed most of the housing stock during the past six weeks,"" Haidai said. 

Haidai also said one person had been injured in shelling of the nearby town of Kreminna.",False,1650181618.0,t3_u5gz0u,t3_u5gz0u,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

**Russia on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown** by Liza Alexandrova-Zorina - [https://granta.com/russia-verge-nervous-breakdown/](https://granta.com/russia-verge-nervous-breakdown/)

‘The Russian people suffer from a victim complex: they believe that nothing depends on them, and by them nothing can be changed.’

>Russia is a country that lives in contradiction. For example, the president tells us that he is fighting the oligarchs, then awards those same oligarchs with medals ‘For Service to the Country.’ Or the government tells us that prices for consumer goods will not rise, and a month later they double. Or the church teaches us that greed is a sin and ‘it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,’ while the Patriarch rides in a motorcade and befriends the rich and mighty. Or officials tell us that there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine, while the media talks constantly about Russia’s military successes on the Ukrainian front.  
>  
>In this atmosphere, people cease to differentiate between the literal and the metaphorical, suspecting intrigue where there is none and, conversely, losing the ability to read between the lines. The acceptance of contradictions is enforced by social pressure: believers are not supposed to criticise priests, tax-payers are not supposed to criticise the government, and criticism of Putin is tantamount to treason.  
>  
>To offset the more glaring contradictions, a number of deputies, clergy and cultural figures regularly voice deliberately unacceptable statements and propose ridiculous initiatives to shock the public, so that they can be graciously declined by higher powers. Legislative initiatives in this form include proposals to ban abortions, to punish homosexual acts, to make military service obligatory for childless women over the age of twenty-three, to deprive people of Russian citizenship if they marry a foreigner, to sentence mothers who go to beach resorts without their husbands to ten years in prison, to limit bad news on television to ten per cent of broadcast time, to prohibit the teaching of evolution in schools, and so on.

Where X would be some threat like we’ll bomb you, or invade you, or take away your birthday.

Do they have any threats left?

They can’t threat more war. Their equipment is at its limit. If they commit more equipment to Ukraine they might not be able to keep their population suppressed or protect their borders.

Nuclear weapons are becoming less of a threat because they say it every day. I think it’s becoming obvious the Putin is a rat and he can’t be trusted to do anything - except not committing suicide.

Chemical weapons are more likely to end up being an own goal. Especially when you are attacking an an easily direction.

Using bombers for carpet bombing isn’t a viable option anywhere Ukrainian positions (except Mariupol) because they’ll be shot down.

That means the Russians are less likely to try to come up with a deal to help investors. In fact, the US could seize 600 billion of assets and give it to Ukraine as reparations. Not to mention it seems commercial Russian debts are also in mass default. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russias-debt-default-one-hardest-080000031.htm

""The impending Russian debt default is likely to be one of the most difficult in history to resolve, Oxford Economics has said.

It could even result in the US seizing the Russian central bank's frozen assets, the consultancy's Tatiana Orlova said.

Russia still has a grace period in which to make dollar payments on its foreign bonds, but analysts say a default is likely.

The impending Russian debt default is likely to be one of the most difficult in history to resolve, and could even lead the US to permanently seize assets from the country's central bank, according to a report from the consultancy Oxford Economics.

Russia is facing its first default on its foreign-currency debt since the aftermath of the Bolshevik revolution in 1918.

The US Treasury earlier this month blocked Russia from paying $650 million due on two bonds using funds held at American banks. Russia has instead tried to pay in rubles, but credit ratings agencies have said this would constitute a default.

Russia has a 30-day grace period from April 4 in which to pay in dollars. But thoughts are now turning to the next steps, and how bondholders might recoup their money.

Tatiana Orlova, lead emerging markets economist at Oxford Economics, said investors face a ""very long and difficult"" legal road. ""Russia's debt crisis will be among the most difficult in history to resolve, since the default has its roots in politics rather than finance,"" she wrote in a report that was sent to clients Thursday.

One of the key problems is that political and financial relations between Russia and the West have completely broken down. That makes the usual default process, whereby bondholders and the government enter negotiations and thrash out a deal, seem unlikely to happen.

Orlova said another problem for bondholders is that Ukraine may lay a claim to Russian assets in international courts to pay for the rebuilding of the country. In that case, investors would have to weigh up whether they want to compete with the Ukrainian government for Russian assets.

The economist said the US might eventually end up seizing the money from the Russian central bank's foreign currency reserves. Western governments have already frozen the bulk of the roughly $600 billion stockpile.

President Joe Biden earlier this year ordered that half of Afghanistan's central bank reserves, which were also frozen, be made available as possible compensation for victims of 9/11 and to fund humanitarian support in the country.

""The US administration could possibly find a stronger moral cause for splitting the US-denominated portion of Russia's FX reserves between Ukraine and bondholders,"" Orlova said.

Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said the government has fulfilled its obligations by paying in rubles. He said last week Western governments are forcing Russia into a default and threatened to take legal action.

It's not just holders of Russian sovereign debt who may have to take to the courts to try to get their money.

Orlova's report said there is likely to be an ""avalanche"" of Russian corporate debt defaults, given that the US is taking a hard line and banning American banks from processing payments.

An international committee of banks last week deemed state-owned Russian Railways to be in default, after sanctions stopped the company from making bond payments.

There were roughly $98 billion of Russian corporate foreign-currency bonds outstanding as the war began in February, according to JPMorgan, with $21.3 billion owned by foreign investors.""",False,1650179454.0,t3_u5gz0u,t3_u5gz0u,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

What are the chances that they're on to a Stalingrad maskirovka in Donbas?

*Military deception based on secrecy was critical in hiding Soviet preparations for the decisive Operation Uranus encirclement in the Battle of Stalingrad.\[37\]\[29\]\[38\] In the historian Paul Adair's view, the successful November 1942 Soviet counter-attack at Stalingrad was the first instance of Stavka's newly discovered confidence in large-scale deception. Proof of the success of the Soviet deception came, Adair notes, from the Chief of the German General Staff, General Kurt Zeitzler, who claimed early in November that ""the Russians no longer have any reserves worth mentioning and are not capable of launching a large-scale attack."" This was two months before the German 6th Army capitulated.\[39\]*  
  
*Hitler's own self-deception played into this, as he was unwilling to believe that the Red Army had sufficient reserves of armour and men. Further, the many ineffective Red Army attacks to the north of Stalingrad had unintentionally given the impression that it was unable to launch any substantial attack, let alone a rapid army-scale pincer movement.\[40\] Careful attention was paid to security, with greatly reduced radio traffic. The Germans failed to detect the creation of five new tank armies.\[41\] Troop movements were successfully concealed by moving the armies up only at night, and camouflaging them by day on the open, treeless steppes.\[41\]*  
  
*Strategic deception included increasing military activity far away, near Moscow. At the sites of the planned attack, elaborate disinformation was fed to the enemy. Defence lines were built to deceive German tactical reconnaissance.\[41\] Civilians within 25 kilometres (16 mi) of the front were evacuated, and trenches were dug around the villages for Luftwaffe reconnaissance to see.\[38\] Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment and boats were prepared to suggest an offensive there.\[41\] The five real bridges that were built for the attack were masked by the construction of seventeen false bridges over the River Don.\[41\]*

>In this case, Russia’s statements and claims appear to be inconsistent. Because, while a massive ship like the Moskva is sailing, it is unprecedented for ammunition inside the ship to burst, engulfing the entire ship in flames with no exterior shelling. Furthermore, there was no bad weather in the Black Sea while Moskva was being towed, as Russia stated. The wave height at the time was about 1 meter, and the wind speed was around 14 knots, indicating mild weather and sea conditions.

And: 

>Ukraine’s assault with Neptune missiles is another curious matter. Because, according to the December 2021 announcement of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, the delivery of Neptune anti-ship missiles was scheduled for April 2022. However, the war fully broke out in February, so it was unclear whether Ukraine has these missiles in its arsenal. The Black Sea Fleet’s unlimited operations near Ukrainian territorial waters reinforced the view that the delivery had failed due to wartime conditions. This was because many believed that if Ukraine had these missiles on the coast, it would establish an A2/ AD (anti-access/area denial) zone, making Russian forces reluctant to approach the Ukrainian coast to avoid a missile attack.

And: 

>The failure of the Moskva to respond to the missile demonstrates that not only do the personnel lack intelligence, but they are also not mentally and physically prepared for this occurrence. There are no records of the CHAFF or decoys being launched, of electronic jamming, of the ship maneuvering, and of the necessary reactions with weapons after the missile is launched, but the fact that such a capable ship is so helpless against an attack far below its capacity shows that the personnel are not well trained.",False,1650216781.0,t3_u5gz0u,t1_i53lpyf,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

.........

(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the “upper classes”, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for “the lower classes not to want” to live in the old way; it is also necessary that “the upper classes should be unable” to rule in the old way;

(2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual;

(3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in “peace time”, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the “upper classes” themselves into independent historical action.

pros:

\- the natives already dislike rule from Moscow because the province's riches benefit Moscow more so than the natives so the place is underdeveloped. United Russia is not very popular there.

\- very very very rich in natural resources amenable to outside investment. ""The soil contains large reserves of oil, gas, coal, diamonds, gold, silver, tin, tungsten and many others. Sakha produces 99% of all Russian diamonds and over 25% of the diamonds mined in the world"".

In all seriousness, this seems like a *bad* idea given that the Ukrainian fighting points are identity and independence.

I could see it being a useful intermediary step to accelerate Ukrainian membership though:

1. Ukraine joins a Polish union and becomes part of a greater Polish commonwealth. As part of Poland it automatically becomes both an EU and NATO member because it's now... just Poland.

2. Ukraine, as a Polish territory, declares independence which both it and Poland accept. Under the framework implemented when the Scottish referendum took place, where had they voted yes, Scotland would have automatically remained an EU and NATO member, Ukraine does the same.

3. Ukraine now in EU and NATO much faster by an alternative route.

No. Tugging the wreck once it's sunk is a huge amount of work, and saves no work on producing a new ship anymore. This ship is as they say ""proper fucked"" and can no longer be restored. Its value is in scrap metal. Even if some of the shape is still intact, the fire and subsequent salt bath mean that the metal itself can't be trusted, particularly at joints. Tempered steel loses its tempering at high temperatures, just as an example. Fire causes rapid oxidation (ever wondered why the blown up tanks already look rusted? It's because they are, they rusted extremely quickly as they burned). Galvanic corrosion sets in because of the salt bath. The ship's hull flexing in unexpected ways creates cracks and microcracks which fundamentally weaken the structural integrity of the parts.  Even if the metal *looks* sound, it would have to be thoroughly inspected inch by inch for cracks (even/*especially* internal ones, some too small for the human eye to see),  loss of heat treatment, and corrosion. All of that takes specialized equipment, and very knowledgeable people.

She than fled to Ukraine. She was hospitalized and Ceasar than went to Ukraine to try and get his son back (which is against U.S. orders they advised him to go to the UN and or Ukrainian government) he picked up his son and was stopped at the airport and the police detained him for attempted kidnapping and took his passport. After a month in jail he agreed to give his son back to his wife and that he would try to go through Ukrainian courts or the UN and they let him go back to the U.S.. Than the war started. His son and exwife(?) Are now in Russia currently and he is trying to work with the Russian courts to get his son back.

Nonviolent action has to be very organized, large in numbers, highly sustained, and fearless because a dictator-like police state will 100% crackdown with violence, imprisonment, and torture; the hard part lies in being willing to take that physical threat to life and safety to fight for more abstract values/ideas/understandings of ""democracy"", ""freedom"", etc. But, it can work when those conditions are satisfied.

Change brought about by nonviolent protests has a higher chance, statistically speaking, of staying and succeeding vs armed coups.

I'm not saying Russians have a 100% chance of overthrowing Putin and changing with nonviolent protests because their entire political and civil system is rotten, from top to bottom but other countries and societies have found themselves facing dictators and authoritarians knowing full well the consequences of acting against them and still went ahead with it to better their prospects and country.

One example is Juarez and El-Paso. Very similar demographics and geography. In fact they are directly separated by a border wall. The only difference therefore is that one inherits the broken institutions of Mexico and the other inherits the more functional institutions of the USA. The reason those institutions exist is historical - Spain set up extractive, aristocratic institutions to exploit the natives, whereas the USA set up somewhat more inclusive institutions. 

Another example is Botswana versus Congo. Two fairly similar nations in geography and culture, but Botswana has had a long history of diplomacy between it's old tribes, which has morphed today into a very functional democratic system.

The famous one is Chechnya, of course, but several of the regions, particularly within the republics (as opposed to the half-dozen other different forms of federal subject), would quite like true independence, and have fought internal conflict over it.

The other ones that get mentioned a *lot* are Dagestan, Tatarstan, and Karachay-Cherkessia, as well as North Ossetia. The majority of the ones that really want to leave are the little states in the North Caucasus which are geographically quite small, but are quite populous.

However, several, much larger regions, including Sakha, Komi, Murmansk, Kamchatka, Buryatia, and Karelia, would also be really good candidates for balkanised states.

Edit: worth saying that Sakha/Yakutia is a *really* prime candidate for somewhere that could end up not-Russian.

And to add also, Jacques Baud has an impressive resume but has veered into pro-Russian conspiracy terrain for years now:

>According to journalist Antoine Hasday, published by Conspiracy Watch, an interview with Jacques Baud given to RT France ""checks all the boxes of geopolitical conspiracy""[18]. The latter, sometimes invited by the traditional media, also intervened on the far-right web-television TV Libertés, as well as before on RT France[18]. Interviewed on this last channel by Frederic Taddeï in September 2020, he minimizes the human toll of the Darfur war, which he reduced to 2,500 deaths (compared to 300,000 according to the UN) and denies the responsibility of the Syrian army for the massacres in Homs in 2011 and in the chemical attacks on Ghouta, Khan Sheikh Taking up the official argument of Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime, he also claims that the photographs taken by the military photographer ""Caesar"" are not those of political opponents who died under torture, but of Syrian army soldiers[18]. Jacques Baud also whitens Russia by believing that the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal was caused by ""food poisoning"" and that Alexei Navalny's poisoning is probably ""the fact of the mafia""[18].

What, someone inquiring as to the effects of a hypothetical?

> that is a major escalation

Yes, that would be one effect.

>  would only happen after the suspension of diplomatic relations between Russia and the U.S.

Maybe, maybe not. The US and Russia / USSR maintained some relations even at the height of the Cold War. And even right now, there are a lot of young men coming home in boxes thanks to weapons that the US is openly giving to Ukraine to be used on Russian forces. 

> because at that point Russia would conduct some sort of blatant offensive actions against the U.S.

Possible, but not guaranteed.

> Also it wouldn't be the U.S. cutting off Russia it would be Russia cutting itself off of the global Internet as a defensive measure against U.S. cyber attacks.

Yeah, the batteries are the weakest part of these. In an active environment (you talk regularly, and receive things every minute), it can go as low as 4 hours. When i deploy them, i tend to have the double in batteries. Yeah, without a base/energy available, it will not be useful for long.

Also, it's two Li-Ion cells in series... without protection or balancing when charging, thus they destroy themselves rather quickly. Best case, you now have a 700mAh battery. And the stock charger has no IC to manage the charging current, the perfect recipe to destroy Li-Ion cells.

Talking about firefights... the belt clip will break easily, so it will be put in a pocket... where the bottom buttons can be activated easily, lighting the screen for x seconds (10 by default i think), and draining the battery too :D

EDIT : i forgot a fun thing ! They have a ""alarm"" button, on top of the PTT button. Orange. It's stupidly easy to activate it.

The question is where to stop. This is determined by what NATO thinks Russia thinks is too much. Which I got downvoted for pointing out.

NATO obviously thinks the point where the risk of nuclear war is not worth it is somewhere between sending javelins, 18 howitzers, etc and implementing a no-fly zone and sending 1800 howitzers. They are continuously making a cost-benefit analysis behind the scenes, so this could change in the future depending, again, on what they think Russia thinks.

It is important to keep in mind that only ~0.56% of the world's population lives in Ukraine. This is one of the reasons why risking a nuclear war, which will affect literally every human on the planet, over Ukraine will never be worth it.

I know this may seem very cynical and callous. I obviously fully support Ukraine too and want them to succeed with all my heart. But if you want to understand how geopolitics work it is necessary to be pragmatic. When deciding how much and what type of aid to send to Ukraine, what Russia thinks is the only thing which really matters. It is just a sad fact. Doesn't matter if you don't like it.

It is incorrect that being pragmatic and level headed about these things is fear mongering.

It is incorrect that there is not a point where antagonizing Russia further to help ~0.56% of the world's population in Ukraine will not be worth the risk of nuclear war, which will affect every human on this planet. Exactly where that point is depends on what Russia thinks, like I pointed out in my previous comment. Obviously Russia doesn't want nuclear war either.

American, I suppose? Perhaps for children there, guns are an ordinary part of life and so toy guns are counted alongside toy cars or toy ovens as a form of imitative domestic play? 

Even so, the toy guns I typically see marketed are not modelled after hunting rifles or small calibre personal defence pistols, but are instead styled on military weapons and presented in a warlike style, all camouflage colours and perhaps with an image of a soldier on the packaging. They may form part of a toy line along with soldier dolls with interchangeable outfits and accessories, model tanks with spring-loaded gun barrel for firing little plastic shells, planes with lovingly detailed bombs and missiles attached below... These are war toys. Why not include an anti tank missile play set?",1650198006.0,1650197662.0,t3_u5gz0u,t1_i52lpdr,,4,7,0,7,0,0,

It is a 50 kilogram device and would do less harm than a 5 kilo device we could make in your garage using pipe.  Javelin is difficult to conceal.  It is a defensive armament realistically only practical for fighting armies.

If we followed the intentions of the founders who wrote the US constitution citizens would have the right to bare javelins.  Removal of repeat fire guns would make US cities much safer.  A citizen militia with Javelins could fill in the power vacuum that forms when the guns are removed.  

Hunting with a rocket propelled spear would be more sporty than using a rifle in my opinion. 

There are good reasons to oppose war toys.  Little boys still probably find them anyway.  I recall using sticks as toy rifles and pine cones as grenades.

The enemy will leave us nothing but scorched earth when he withdraws, without paying the slightest regard to the population. I therefore order:

>""1) All military transport and communication facilities, industrial establishments and supply depots, as well as anything else of value within Reich territory, which could in any way be used by the enemy immediately or within the foreseeable future for the prosecution of the war, will be destroyed.""

Such actions could perhaps make it easier to fight a guerrilla war which were the orders given to the SS. Though he failed to take into account the impact destroying their own cities would have on the soldiers.

I think this is the important part:

>The decree was in vain. The responsibility for carrying it out fell to Albert Speer, Hitler's Minister of Armaments and War Production. According to him, Speer was appalled by the order and lost faith in the dictator. Just as von Choltitz had several months earlier, Speer deliberately failed to carry out the order. Upon receiving it, he requested to be given exclusive power to implement the plan, instead using his power to convince the generals and Gauleiters to ignore the order. Hitler remained unaware of this until the very end of the war, when Speer, while visiting Hitler in his Berlin bunker, admitted to him that he deliberately disobeyed. Hitler was angry with his minister, but allowed Speer to leave nonetheless. Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, 42 days after issuing the order.

 So horshoe theory just ends up being a bludgeon that people in the ""center"" use to hit people on the most extreme ends, regardless of their own political ideological position and how it actually would transpose across the horshoe.

>The Black Sun (German: Schwarze Sonne) is a Nazi symbol, a type of sun wheel (German: Sonnenrad)[1][2] employed in Nazi Germany and later by neo-Nazis and in some strains of Satanism. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sig runes, similar to the symbols employed by the SS in their logo.[note 1] It first appeared in Nazi Germany as a design element in a castle at Wewelsburg remodeled and expanded by the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, which he intended to be a center for the SS.

>The Black Sun symbol is widely used by neo-fascist, neo-Nazi,[6] the far-right and white nationalists. The symbol often appears on extremist flags, t-shirts, posters, websites and in extremist publications associated with such groups.

That's the line that every Russian hears, and chooses to support, ignore, or resist.  This ""territorial expansion"" is the REWARD for supporting the regime.

Any self-respecting Russian would laugh and spit in your face, and do it with impunity because ""good people of the West don't take their stuff back from you after you've stolen it.""


Your attitude towards Russian citizens in relation to their regime is part of how Russia has maneuvered its way into such a geopolitically influential position to begin with.  People with your attitude are really carrying Neville Chamberlain's Torch of Appeasement right into 21st-century Central Europe.  ...And let me guess:  If Russians take advantage of generous concessions to re-impose aggressive policies, you will see yourself as totally not accountable for that action.

You have a few ways to detect submarines: noise, magnetism, communications and visual.


Visual and magnetic are basically out of the question due to modern technology and the fact that they dive.


Sound is the most reliable, but that's why submarine design focuses so much on quiet. NATO has a ton of listening stations and patrol flights and technology, but only so much can be done.

Communication requires the vessel be transmitting, so they can just be silent and they're lost to tracking.


Autonomous underwater drones are very expensive and can't run for long enough to track submarines. They can't easily send and receive the data necessary for control while submerged. So no there aren't drones just following along.

> Finland was restored to its borders of 1 January 1941 (thus confirming its territorial losses after the Winter War of 1939-40), except for the former province of Petsamo, which was ceded to the Soviet Union. In Finland, the reparations and the dictated border adjustment were perceived as a major injustice and a betrayal by the Western powers, after the sympathy Finland had received from the West during the Soviet-initiated Winter War. However, this sympathy had been eroded by Finland's collaboration with Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1944. During this time, Finland not only recaptured territory it had lost in 1940, but continued its offensive deeper into Soviet lands, occupying a broad strip of Soviet territory. This prompted the United Kingdom to declare war on Finland in December 1941, further weakening political support in the West for the country. The Soviet Union's accessions of Finnish territory was based on the Moscow Armistice signed in Moscow on 19 September 1944 and resulted in an extension of the accessions in the Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War.

Finland says it's Russia, Russia says it's Russia, so it's Russia.

For the Nazis, it's a home-grown religion created of white Northern Europeans, so it's simultaneously appealing to white supremacists, as well as nationalists of the countries concerned. As a helpful side effect, it also happens to not have some of the 'love your neighbour' baggage of Christianity which can be problematic for fascists.

It's not so much Nazis latching onto this doctrine because of what exactly the doctrine is, so much as that it can be part of a bundle of white supremacist or Scandinavian/Germanic nationalist ideology. In addition, it's less problematic to be a racist pagan than a racist Christian because there's no agreed-upon book of pagan thought saying what it means to be a pagan that people can use to contradict you.

See, fascism just latches on to popular prejudices as a way of building a mass movement around overt inequality. It doesn't much matter what the prejudices are, as long as it's a selling point where the fascists are trying to win power - in Germany, it'll  be antisemitic or anti-Slav prejudice. In Eastern Europe, it'll be aimed at the Romany people. In Scotland or Northern Ireland, it might take the form of anticatholic or anti-Irish bigotry. In the USA, the primary focus will often be African Americans. The actual nature of the bigotry doesn't much matter (and it changes from place to place and decade to decade), just so long as it's commonly held. Hypernationalism is ubiquitous among fascists, because nation states, patriotism and the associated mindsets are ubiquitous among the general population - which can lead to paradoxical cases, like 'Scottish Dawn' which was an ostensibly Scottish nationalist offshoot of 'National Action', which was a British neo-Nazi fraction. One minute some Nazi prick was waving a Union Jack, next minute he was claiming to be a fervent Scottish nationalist, go figure.

So tldr; the Nazi idea of Nordic Paganism is just some junk mythology that's used to sell fascism to people from Scandinavian and Germanic countries (and maybe ditch Christianity, since that dogma sometimes conflicts with fascist ideas). There's not much more to it than that, but it's enough of a thing that you can see tons of pagan symbology and cultural artifacts (some parts of the black metal and neofolk music scenes, for instance) expressing that linkage.",1650213037.0,1650212742.0,t3_u5gz0u,t1_i53ejvp,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Where?

Russia says a lot of things according to Russia. They were all a bunch of lies and bluster. No one recognizes Crimea as Russian. And Ukraine will attack with everything it has, which thus far has shown to be a lot better than what Russia has.

>	Even if you get past that, to invade Crimea you need a good navy, which Ukraine doesnt even have. 

I’m not even sure why you’d think that is true. Ukraine can keep the Russian Navy away by blowing them up if they get close. The West can ship far more anti-ship missiles than Russia has ships, plus the Neptune is clearly capable of sinking any Russian ship in the Black Sea. At that point, it doesn’t matter who has a good Navy or doesn’t, because it doesn’t play at all.

Even the Azov's apologists put the presence of Neo-Nazis in their ranks as something like 10%. Putin's 'denazification' story is bullshit, but that certainly doesn't mean there isn't a fascist problem in Ukraine.

And I wouldn't say the fascist/pagan association was necessarily 'woolly'.

And yet Moscow didn't start a shooting war with the US and the US  didn't start one with Moscow because neither side is crazy enough to risk mutual annihilation. 

And you think one will start because of Ukraine? When Russia is a shell of its former self while the US has never stopped spending Cold War levels of money on the military?

Putin is a Machiavellian ex-KGB officer who lives and breathes Realpolitik. Nothing he has done has been reckless. Everything is calculated. He might have been *wrong* about the difficulty of invading Ukraine, but that wasn't due to lack of discipline.
