The first being that it’s mined and lack enough demining equipment.**

Earlier this month, this issue was addressed in an article in the [*Washington Post*](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ukrainian-demining-units-clearing-frontline-140500202.html):

> Serhiy Matveychuk, a colonel in Ukraine’s Directorate of Engineer Troops, told the WP that **Russia has created a “massive system of engineering barriers” that pose a “serious obstacle to the mobility of troops.”**

> He explained that while **anti-tank mines** can be detected using drones, the situation with **anti-personnel mines** is more complex.

> Once the Ukrainians cross their own lines, they will need to break through Russian minefields, which requires greater speed.

> […] A more modern approach involves the use of specialized equipment designed to penetrate such defenses, including mechanized demining systems, linear charges, and engineering tanks. […]

> Western partners have also provided modern engineering tanks, including the anti-mine tank Leopard 2R, a modification of the renowned German battle tank. Matveychuk noted that the Leopard 2R can not only clear mines but also remove other types of obstacles, such as fences and embankments.

> The M1150 assault breacher vehicle, based on the chassis of the American M1 Abrams main battle tank, is considered the best option for this work. **While Kyiv has requested this technology from Washington, it is not currently being supplied.**

> Some analysts also highlight another issue: **while the West has focused on providing missiles, armored vehicles, and ammunition to Kyiv, it has not provided adequate support for breaking through Russia’s defenses.**

> Matveychuk **identifies the lack of engineering tanks and similar equipment in the Ukrainian army as a “problematic” issue**.

> “Despite the significant amount of armament provided to Ukraine for repelling the aggressor’s attack, **the [lack of] provision of engineering units with engineering tanks and other equipment remains a problematic issue**,” he told the publication.

> Should Ukrainian forces manage to find a path through the minefields, they will need to implement a comprehensive military strategy to achieve a swift breakthrough. In the event of a successful breakthrough, Ukrainian demining units will resume their work of clearing territories along the front line.

I think this and some of the other footage coming out suggests the Ukes have made a significant change to their tactics on that axis in the last week or two that is starting to pay dividends- they've realised that the russian minefields and close air support are effective enough too make it impractical to advance with an armored fist.

So they're now assaulting russian positions the old fashioned way, with infiltration tactics and experienced, high morale assault infantry moving forward on foot supported by artillery, taking russian positions in close combat and then exploiting their gains themselves rather than waiting for the armored columns. 

If that is what is happening it means they have some hard weeks ahead of them and will certainly take heavier casualties than from a successful armored breakthrough, but it makes sense because it allows them to exploit the edge they've had in training, morale, small unit tactics and  infantry NCOs and junior officers, without giving russia high value targets to hit with their artillery or helicopters. The armor will still get a run, but not until in the minefields are gone and the main russian defensive lines are broken up, and they can move freely.

They represent the part of the army Prigozhin expected to join his cause. They were taken/pressed by the FSB (or whatever Putin-loyal faction) and clearly sent the videos as a message to Prigozhin, since he wasn't available on the phone... if we want to believe Lukashenko in his last interview.

Many things are dramatically modernising but we are many decades away from this potentially not being the case.

People tend to think of technological advances as replacing or changing warfare away from certain norms. This is generally not the case, new tech augments the existing norms, or adjusts processes and tactical decision making. Technological counters invariably develop as well.

Drones appear, counter drone technology, accurate AA gun platforms come back in fashion, etc.

A good example is rocket/guided rocket ranged fires... They haven't replaced barrel artillery, they've augmented it. Sure their range and precision and destruction may be higher, but per shell they cost more.

Same same with Armoured vehicles, they adapted the combat on the ground and made trench warfare less of a thing, but trenches with the right manning, equipment and support are still a very effective defensive measure, particularly with ATGM (counter-armour measures).

We haven't seen WW1 combat, but we've seen some stuff that resembles it. Even then said combat has looked more like some of the nastier WW2 grinds.

Armoured breakthroughs are possible but there are ATGMs, other anti-armour weapons, mines and all sorts of things.

He was replaced as the top commander in January but retained influence in running war operations and remains popular among the troops.

Mr. Prigozhin had worked with General Surovikin during Russia’s military intervention in Syria, and had described him as the most capable commander in the Russian army. Former officials said General Surovikin did not support pushing Mr. Putin from power but appears to have agreed with Mr. Prigozhin that Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov needed to be relieved of duty.

“Surovikin is a decorated general with a complex history,” said Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. “He is said to be respected by the soldiers and viewed as competent.”

General Surovikin and Mr. Prigozhin have both brushed up against Mr. Shoigu and General Gerasimov over tactics used in Ukraine. While the Russian military’s overall performance in the war has been widely derided as underwhelming, analysts have credited General Surovikin and Mr. Prigozhin for Russia’s few successes.

In General Surovikin’s case, that limited success was the professionally managed withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson, where they were nearly encircled last fall and cut off from supplies. Based on communications intercepts, U.S. officials concluded that a frustrated General Surovikin represented a hard-line faction of generals intent on using the toughest tactics against Ukrainians.

What has killed both russian and ukrainian armor since the start of the war is not the initial defensive lines, it is once an armored column is on the move en masse, if they hit a bottleneck or some sort of obstacle that means they have to stop whilst its cleared, or even just need to stop to rest/refuel after a breakthrough they are extremely vulnerable.

That one stuck with me, but I gained another that I didn't like so much. The Iceman. One day, we had what the Aussies called a bit of a brass-up. Just our ship alone, but we caught an NVA battalion crossing a river, and wonder of wonders, we got permission to fire before they finished. The gunner had a round explode in the chamber, jamming his 60, and the fool had left his barrel bag, with spares, back in the revetment. So while he was frantically rummaging under my seat for my barrel bag, it was over to me, young and crazy, standing on the skid, singing something by the Stones at the of my lungs with the mike keyed so the others could listen in, and Lord, Lord, I rode that 60. 3000 rounds, an empty ammo box, and a smoking barrel that I had burned out because I didn't want to take the time to change. We got ordered out right after I went dry, so the artillery could open up, and of course, the arty took credit for every body recovered, but we could count how many bodies were floating in the river when we pulled out. The next day in the orderly room an officer with a literary bent announced my entrance with ""Behold, the Iceman cometh."" For those of you unfamiliar with Eugene O'Neil, the Iceman was Death. I hated that name, but I couldn't shake it. And, to tell you the truth, by that time maybe it fit. I have, or used to have, a photo of a young man sitting on a log eating C-rations with a pair of chopsticks. There are three dead NVA laid out in a line just beside him. He didn't kill them. He didn't chose to sit there because of the bodies. It was just the most convenient place to sit. The bodies don't bother him. He doesn't care. They're just part of the landscape. The young man is glancing at the camera, and you know in one look that you aren't going to take this guy home to meet your parents. Back in the world, you wouldn't want him in your neighborhood, because he is cold, cold, cold. I strangled that SOB, drove a stake through his heart, and buried him face down under a crossroad outside Saigon before coming home, because I knew that guy wasn't made to survive in a civilian environment. I think he's gone. All of him. I hope so. I much prefer being remembered as Ganesha, the Remover of Obstacles.

Even a standard RPG might give it a very bad day, an ATGM designed to be used against a tank will shred it. So yes while support from IFV's can be very handy in an attack they are also even more vulnerable than a tank, the longer they are near the front lines the greater chance some Russian manages to get their hands on a weapon that can do real damage. In addition with the number of mines used in this conflict is a big reason in many assaults the IFV's or APC's drop troops off and retrace their own tracks away, traveling up and down the trench line probably drastically increases the chance of being hit by a mine.

That being said I have seen tanks doing what you suggest and running right over trench lines in this war and in other assaults IFV's/APC's offering more supporting fire, I think it greatly depends on the situation. If they're worried about mines and heavy weapons it's not going to do the attacking infantry any good to have to deal with a disabled vehicle. *Edit:* For instance if you need to clear mines just to approach the trench line you're not going to be running vehicles all over the place for supporting fire as hitting a mine would probably be inevitable. In this particular fight the ground looks extremely barren where the trench is located meaning any Russian soldiers with anti armor weapons are more likely to be able to spot and attack an armored vehicle from long distance as well.

Anyway, it's an oversimplification, but a lot of the story of the Eastern Front in WW2 can be described as Stalin learning to delegate and allow competent underlings the latitude to turn their expertise into success while Hitler became more and more of a micromanager, pushing out the capable generals who were able to tell him what was what in favor of sycophants, and ultimately giving asinine orders to his commanders which hastened their downfall.

1. First of all, I browse Twitter through my mobile browser, not an app. That means just going to twitter dot com. Some of the below things seem to work this way specifically through the browser and not the app. 

2. Instead of just clicking Follow and browsing my home feed, I add every account I follow to a List on Twitter using the Lists feature. It can just be every account on one big list, or by category. 

3. Now that I have a List of everyone, I pin the List to my Twitter home page so that it becomes a tab next to the ‘for you’ section or whatever it says. If you don’t know how to do that just google it.  

4. Then I just hit that list’s tab and use it as my home feed.

Why do I use all of these steps? Well, with this combination, I do not see anything other than what I want (that includes ads in between posts, trending hashtags, etc!) and it gets posted entirely in chronological order, not by popularity/algorithm. I can honestly forget the rest of the site even exists. I don’t know why, but in Lists I don’t get served ANY ads at all on the mobile browser, but the home feed still gets them.

EU membership is a multi-year process involving a lot more than cultural alignment. Economic alignment, alignment on food standards, industria standards, and many other things must be achieved. It would leave Ukraine open to re-invasion for a long period.

Turkey is a NATO member that tried but failed to achieve EU membership. They have their own distinct culture and values - we can see for instance the distaste some Turkish politicians have for conventional capitalism in the recent interest rate and currency crisis. They have played a key role in this conflict - hosting nuclear weapons that reduce the chance of nuclear escalation, closing the surounding sea to military vessels, and supplying drones. They have done this within a difficult regional and economic context - not a perfect NATO citizen yes, but enough.

NATO is in the end a military alliance, largely against Russia. The test for a partner is whether they are likely to fullfill their role as a member of that alliance. It's hard to argue that a post war Ukraine wouldn't.  We can also consider whether it is in the interests of the rest of the alliance - we can see the knock on effects of war in europe today so reducing the likelyhood of re-occurance is clearly in the members interests.

We can hope that a future Ukraine will have a functioning politic that chooses to go for EU membership, and makes the legal, cultural and economic changes neccesary.

That's why the far-right is on the rise, they give the perception that they have a solution to the world's problems in a way the other groupings don't.
