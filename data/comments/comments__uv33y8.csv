Day 88 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was again very quiet in my area, though if we go onto the balcony facing north we can hear constant explosions in the distance. Other districts were shelled at least a couple times today, and air raid alerts are almost constant too, and it is still active right now. 

Just to put it into perspective, out of the last 3 hours, the air raid alert was active for around 2.5 hours. There are no working air raid sirens close by, so we rarely hear it live, and mostly just hear it from the air raid app on the phone, but we can still hear it in the distance, and I got to say, when you are outside, the air raid sirens, coupled with the sounds of artillery, sound extremely ominous, it really makes you feel unsafe being outside, it’s not a pleasant feeling.

Somebody was asking how badly damaged Botanical Gardens are, it’s hard to say, I can’t confirm it personally yet, but there are pretty much no districts that weren’t shelled. Sarzhyn Yar was shelled many times during this war and people are advised not to go there, and even if you do go, to not stray from roads, as there are still explosives/mines in the park and it is being demined.",False,1653270566.0,t3_uv33y8,t3_uv33y8,,0,119,0,119,2,0,

tl;dr: Prof Phillips P. OBrien: 

* Russia is intensely focusing on Severodonetsk.


* Not much is happening anywhere else on the lines.


* Overall combat intensity (away from Severodonetsk) continues to trend downwards; Russian attacks have stalled. This reflects diminished Russian combat capabilities. Inferred from daily casualty figures.

* This will be the final battle to decide where the lines will stand before a transition to an attrition based ranged artillery duel.

* That will be a fight between more advanced UA weapons vs Russian numbers (of artillery). Russia will also have to deal with UA spec ops and insurgency behind the lines, limiting their mobility. Evidence of this is becoming more prominent recently.

From CNN's Chris Liakos in Davos, Switzerland

The venue typically used by Russia to promote itself at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos has been rebranded as the Russian War Crimes House. 

Russia House was used to host events at WEF by Russians for many years. A Ukrainian businessman, working with WEF, has turned the venue into an exhibition depicting the devastation and destruction of the war in Ukraine. 

Organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation and PinchukArtCentre, an international centre for contemporary art based in Kyiv, “the exhibition aims to inform about the main facts, share faces, names and dates and provide at least some of the victims a platform from which to tell their real story,” the foundation said in a press release.

Björn Geldhof, the exhibition's curator, told CNN that the process of collecting and verifying the images took about one-and-a-half weeks, collecting more than 4,600 images showing “overwhelming amount of evidence of war crimes.”

“An exhibition as this, is one of the steps to raise awareness for the absolute necessity of bringing war criminals to justice and this is not exclusively the task of Ukraine, this is a common task, this is a task for all countries in the world to say this cannot be,” Geldhof told CNN.

He added that this project is “about people” who have been attacked and killed. “And we need to honor them, we need to give them a voice and we need to give them a face,” he said.

Russian politicians and businessmen were not invited to this year’s World Economic Forum after Russia invaded Ukraine.

“As Russia is not here, we had the opportunity to speak about Russia but about a different reality of Russia, about the war crimes that Russia is committing in Ukraine,” Geldhof said adding that “it is incredibly important to show what Russia is really doing in Ukraine which is proactively and consciously targeting civilians, killing, raping civilians in a way to try to exterminate Ukraine as a nation.”

**Andriy Zagorodnyuk: ‘Those saying Ukraine can’t win don’t understand the situation’**

*(...)*

*The Kyiv Independent: What exactly do you think is wrong here?*   
  
*Andriy Zagorodnyuk: The key wrong assumption is that Ukraine can’t win therefore it has to make a deal. We believe it’s an invalid argument because of two reasons.*   
  
*First — Ukraine can win, and this in many ways depends on how our partners, including the U.S., are going to be sending weapons, hardware, and munitions. And second — we see absolutely no chances for a negotiation process. Russia has not demonstrated the slightest signs of altering its strategic goals regarding Ukraine. They keep pushing for their narratives, they keep waging the war and going offensive. No point talking about any sort of compromise and negotiations.*   
  
*A lot of things have been done and can’t be undone — the war crimes, the things that we can surely identify as acts of state terrorism. We will always be sticking to the stance saying that (Vladimir) Putin and his military are war criminals and they have to leave our territory. If they end up being ready for talks, there can potentially be talks. But now they don’t, so we have nothing to talk about.”*   
  
*When some foreign journalists or observers are trying to tell us we will have to talk anyway, it means they don’t understand the situation.*   
  
*The Kyiv Independent: So you think Russia can be defeated?*  
  
*Andriy Zagorodnyuk: The situation is changing rapidly, and it seems that many people can’t catch up with what’s happening. And they have already started giving advice and voicing their opinions on what should be done. There’s a psychological barrier that is blocking them from believing that Russia can be severely defeated. It has been built on the long-lasting assumption that Russia is a military superpower, an undefeated force.*  
  
*This thought is so deeply ingrained that they can’t believe Russia’s super military is fake. Even the Russian leadership didn’t understand this, because of the lack of democratic civilian control of the military.*    
  
*We must explain that Russia can be defeated. The very way (Saddam Hussein’s) Iraqi military was defeated, along with others. Russians can and may be defeated. Because they are weak. It’s clear that they have a lot of vehicles and a lot of people. But the hardware is wacky, people are poorly trained, and all they are doing is rendering pressure upon us with their mass.*

I think some people have a very wrong image of what Russia actually wants and why this war happened. First, why hasn't there been a diplomatic solution yet? Because Russia is likely not negotiating in good faith, and their demands about ""neutrality"" would mean the Belarusization, not Finlandization, of Ukraine. Furthermore it's likely that the Russians will want to either annex Kherson, Zaporizihia, etc or make them into new DPRs. Again further unacceptable.

And finally about ""NATO expansion"". NATO never posed a threat to Russian security interests, in the sense that, if Ukraine was ever going to join NATO (there was no chance of it), NATO was going to use that to invade Russia. That was never going to happen. But what a western defense alliance like NATO, and what Ukrainian membership in it actually posed a threat to, was Russia's imperial, nationalist, and irredentist ambitions. 

Note how Putin and the people around him, have expressed nationalist views, how they deny the existence of Ukrainian statehood, or how Putin quotes the fascist Ivan Ilyin?.

**For Russia’s Exiled Ethnic Activists, Ukraine War a ‘Window of Opportunity’**  


>As the death toll from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine rises, throwing Kremlin imperialism into sharper focus, activists representing the indigenous non-Slavic peoples of Russia are doubling down on efforts to rally supporters behind demands for greater autonomy.    
“War is a trigger for greater national consciousness,” Ruslan Gabbasov, the head of the Bashkir National Political Center, told The Moscow Times.   
**A disproportionate share of the Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine have come from the country’s minority ethnic communities, many of which are already blighted by poverty and targeted by official discrimination.**  
As the conflict drags on, ethnic activists hope that the colonialist overtones of Russia’s brutal invasion, which has also seen economic appropriation of Ukrainian resources and summary killings of unarmed men, could fuel discontent among non-Slavic groups – and even provide the political momentum to change the current structure of the Russian Federation.  
“There will be a window of opportunity, and we will use it to get maximum rights and freedoms for our republic of Bashkortostan. We will try to become a sovereign state equal to others in the global arena,” said the Lithuania-based Gabbasov, who fled Russia in 2020.

>	There is clearly an intense battle raging between Popasna and Severodonetsk as the Russians make a major effort to snip off this Ukrainian salient, shorten their lines and seize 1 of the last Ukrainian cities in the region. Ystrdays @TheStudyofWar report.

>	Here is their map of the area of operations as the Russians try to cut off Severodonetsk.

https://i.imgur.com/M1A7P5U.jpg

>	And the Russians really are making a major effort. They have blown up one of the few bridges into Severodonetsk from the west as they try to isolate the city. 

>	Ukrainians clearly admitting the difficulty of the fight too, as President Zelensky's speech last night made explicit. 

>	Otoh, this focus is a sign of a drastic reduction in Russian goals and seems to be going along with a significant reduction in combat intensity in Ukraine as a whole. Here is a map where the area of fighting (black circle) so you can see what a small part of the front it is.

https://i.imgur.com/EVO4Bx2.jpg

>	And using Ukrainian claims of Russian losses as an indicator of combat intensity. Russian offensive action (which would result in Tank and APC losses) is on a clear downward trajectory.

>	Other than the last peak of May 11-13 (which coincided with the disastrous Russian attempt to cross the S. Donets River, loss claims have been trending downwards for a while now. 

>	So the fighting seems very intense in a small part of the line, but overall there is a lessening of combat. And this seems to confirm that we will be moving to a range-weapon for a duel once the line in the Donbas roughly stabilizes after the Severodonetsk battle resolves.

>	There might be Rus and Ukr attempts to improve their positions in certain parts of the line. However, if Ukrainian behavior remains consistent, there will be no immediate counteroffensive, unless they find a very weak part of the Russian line and can threaten Russian logistics.

>	Instead, the Ukrainians seem determined to get as much ranged weaponry as possible for a significant attempt to degrade Russian forces before attempting anything risky (which makes sense). Ukrainians seem to have understood just how dangerous forward movements are these days.

>	2 examples yesterday of Ukr calls for more ranged weapons. Pres Zelensky made an explicit call for more MLRS.

>	And there was this tweet by @IAPonomarenko yesterday which I highlighted. https://twitter.com/iaponomarenko/status/1528027263098298370?s=21&t=CJLQ_cPHCPxFm4NH6AwFLA

>	So in a sense we are heading towards the end of the Battle of Donbas. There will be a nasty fight around Severodonetsk before we know how it ends. Overall, however the war is transitioning to a larger, ranged battle along the line. That could go on for a while.

>	In that line battle the Russian advantage will be the number of artillery systems. Ukrainian advantages will be better artillery systems with more range (more M777s on the way). Plus, action behind Russian lines. 

>	There are growing reports of Ukr actions behind Russian lines, both SF operations and signs of an insurgency.

>	This could be a major problem for the Russian army once most movement stops and a range-battle starts. They will have less flexibility of movement and make easier targets. Its one of the reasons a static battle over the summer favors Ukraine clearly--imho

It took a few weeks of sleeping on crates of grenades for a bed and hiding his face from Ukrainians amid a growing sense of guilt, for the Russian junior officer to come to his conclusion: This wasn't his battle to fight.

From CNN’s Martin Goillandeau in London

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Ukrainian children they should be ""immensely proud"" of themselves in an open letter published Sunday, three months into the Russian invasion that has displaced millions of refugees within Ukraine and abroad.

""Many of you have seen or experienced things no child should have to witness. Yet, everyday Ukrainian children are teaching all of us what it means to be strong and dignified. To hold your head high in the toughest of times. I can think of no better role model for children and adults everywhere,"" Johnson wrote.

The British PM said ""the absence of children and young people on the streets and in the parks"" he saw when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed him around Kyiv last month made him ""feel very sad."" According to UNICEF, more than half of Ukraine’s 7.5 million children have been forced to flee the ongoing violence, as homes, schools, water supplies and hospitals have been damaged or destroyed.

Boris Johnson also told Ukrainian children: ""you are not alone,"" echoing many messages of solidarity expressed in the United Kingdom and in many other countries.

You may be separated from your friends at home, but you have millions of others all over the world.

""Here in the United Kingdom. We fly Ukrainian flags from our homes, offices, churches, shops and playgrounds. Even from my own roof in Downing Street, where the windows are filled with sunflowers drawn by British children. Our young people are painting your flag in their classrooms and making blue and yellow bracelets in support of your country,"" his letter read.

Johnson shared Zelensky’s hopes regarding the end of the conflict: ""I believe, like your president, that Ukraine is going to win this war,"" he wrote.

""I hope with all my heart that one day soon, you will be free to return to your homes, your schools, your families, and whatever happens, however long it takes.""

Reddit employees seem to have detected and mitigated some kind of something, they shadowbanned several accounts with a similar username pattern and comment content in this thread. I'll admit, I didn't look into these accounts myself, so I can't really say anything more, and I have to stress this is extreme conjecture on my part and really just an informed guess. 

Anyway, the accounts they're actioning are accounts that have been pretty consistently implying that other people are bots and ""calling tactics out"" and stuff. 

[Example, username censored in the possible case that I am wrong](https://imgur.com/iPAtV6Z). 

Again, I have no actual tangible data aside from this.  They, very possibly, could have been suspended for sending abusive DMs to people they thought were bots or something (although Reddit is recently more shy about shadowbanning real people for regular offenses).

I also can't stress this enough, Russian, Iranian, and Macedonian teenager agitprop ops have, in the past, accused regular users of being bots/shills in order to intentionally confuse people and promote suspicion. One of their explicit, undeniable goals is to sow division by way of people being suspicious that everything is a bot. And, by and large, this is the objective that they've succeeded with the most. 

So yes, be on the lookout for bots and trolls and stuff. Earlier this week, yall did detect and mitigate an op with votes before the mods even saw it, it is something that can be done. 

But at the same time, you need to demand tangible evidence from people making accusations. ""Saying [phrase] and talking about [event], this is a standard bot tactic"" is something I see commenters say a lot, but that's literally just them making stuff up.  Anything that's tangible is going to have exact wording matches, account batching signs, tons of content neutral indicators that the account and the activity is inorganic. You should never solely rely on the content of a single comment to determine that someone is a bot, you look at the whole account and try to find inconsistencies. 

So please please please, the next time you see someone accusing someone else of being a troll or bot, demand evidence.  Say ""prove it.""

Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region.  


  
  
Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"".

Now they are trying to starve out the countries that depend on Ukrainian and Russian wheat. 100% of Somalia and Benin’s wheat come from Ukraine and Russia.  Laos 94%, Egypt 82%, Sudan 75%.. more in the graph linked below:

Source: Statista
https://i.imgur.com/mjF58Sm.jpg

The blockade of the Black Sea By Russia is seeing 20 million tons of Ukrainian grain stuck in silos in Ukrainian ports. It is not rotten yet - but as temperatures become milder and hotter - it will certainly rot soon. 

My opinion: Russia will wait for countries dependent on this wheat to starve - then open the floodgates for Russian exported wheat that will be priced (in rubles) to gouge some of the poorest countries in the world. This will provide much a much needed injection of capital into the Russian war machine - thus dragging this war out even further. Unless the world/NATO steps in to unblock the Black Sea - many will die of starvation and the Russian economy will benefit from the desperation and suffering they have inflicted on other countries. 

Even if the ports are unblocked - the production of Ukrainian wheat is predicted to be poor this year due to weather and war… but Russia is predicted to have an excellent wheat yield this year due to favorable weather conditions. Once the blockade stops - even if Ukraine wants to export their wheat - it will have spoiled by then and there will be minimal new production.. thus cornering the wheat market in Russia’s favour. 

I am worried that there is no solution - even with intervention… unless the intervention is tomorrow… otherwise it will be too late. And tomorrow won’t happen because Putin will threaten escalation and rattle his saber until his position in the wheat market is secured.

Edit: I’m glad a lot of countries’ staple foods are not dependent on wheat - but I know middle eastern countries including Egypt are very dependent on bread as a staple. 

I hope the west can ship enough food to fill the gaps - but shipping across oceans is a very slow process and getting that food where it needs to go on the ground is even slower. It takes 3 weeks to unload 1 train full of grain… if food stores are only 10 weeks… we getting get food there yesterday.",1653232641.0,1653229859.0,t3_uv33y8,t3_uv33y8,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

So, obviously there might be some differences between the US and Russia's nuclear arsenal. But it seems pretty clear that nukes require a lot of work and money to maintain effectiveness. The US isn't even building new nukes and it's costing them 60 billion a year to maintain their arsenal. In comparison, the entire Russian military budget is only 65 billion dollars.

**FROM IRAQ TO UKRAINE: A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE RUSSIAN-WESTERN CONFRONTATION**

*(...)*

*Highlighting the role of Iraq in the breakdown in Russian-American relations during the 1990s does not negate the importance of NATO expansion or Balkan interventions. However, it does challenge some of the assumptions that stem from a Eurocentric analysis. Pundits and analysts who blame the West for the breakdown in Russian-American relations often point to Western policies in Russia’s near abroad. Yet, expanding the scope to include Iraq suggests that threats to the Russian homeland did not necessarily drive Russian policies. By extension, a few Western policy shifts in Eastern Europe would not have changed the course of history.*  
  
*Neither was American liberalism necessarily at the heart of the dispute. Russia’s fury with American policies in Iraq were most acute when Washington’s propensity for unilateralism led it to defy liberal principles such as commitment to a rules-based system and international law.*  
  
*That type of unilateralism was at the heart of Moscow’s disagreement with the United States both in Iraq and in the post-Cold War world more generally. After winning the Cold War, the United States dominated the post-Cold War order. Moscow did not like how decisions were being made, or who was making them. As the case of Iraq shows, the Russians could complain and protest, yet they were not powerful enough to shape events in the manner that they saw fit. In the end, Moscow’s dissatisfaction with its own weakness was and remains a much more fundamental issue than NATO expansion. But addressing it would require more than simply changing a few American policies in Eastern Europe.*

Russia's own stockpile of such munitions being mainly spent and of an older generation to US/UK-manufacture.  

And probably not getting enough of them to blanket an area; they will be used for choice targets deep in enemy territory and combined with raw intelligence.  

So I see the coming attrition battle to be fairly evenly matched in terms of range.  It'll come down to intelligence gathering abilities in the form of drones and moles.  UA will pick off specific targets with guided munitions and use dumb ammo the rest of the time; Russia will use mainly dumb ammo but much more of it in a wide-net strategy of knocking down anything taller than a tree.  

Important to note that recommended range attached to specific pieces of artillery is not the range at which they can fire exhaustively.  It's a guarantor of precision up to and including that point within a margin of error.

Guns are quite competitive with rocket propulsion because the tube is not accelerated (rather is accelerate in opposite direction making it reaction mass). In a rocket the propellant has to accelerate both the payload and the rocket engine.  With Excalibur the gun is the first stage of a two stage system. 

The challenge is to build rocket controls that are not damaged during launch.  If you tried it with astronauts you get a sort of mashed hamburger pulp.  Acceleration is around a thousand times what a human can survive.  The device needs working control surfaces not just a fuse. Apparently they have got that functioning.  

All other aspect of precision aim are irrelevant if you have control of the last rocket stage.  

The extended range sacrifices explosive.  The precision easily makes up for that if you are hitting a known target like a vehicle.

Let's play pretend and work through this for 2 boats:

* finding four decommissioned submarines -- a couple of months minimum (according to Wikipedia, the US' last diesel-powered sub was taken out of service in 1990).  Why four?  Given the boats age and length of time ut of service, you'd want to plan on a failure rate.
* getting them seaworthy with weapons/survivability systems that'd give them a fighting chance -- probably two years and a couple of billion dollars.
* getting a crew ready for the first sailing (I'd say say a year and a half would be aggressive).  After training, you'd have a boat staffed with inexperienced people who haven't worked together previously.
* once everything ready, it's time to get ready for the mission which would probably take a month and then throw in a few weeks for transit to the Black Sea.

Even though the training and retrofitting could happen in parallel, I didn't factor any delays in.  Realistically, if this was going to happen, it needed to start in 2015-2016.

So what could work?

* Destroying the russian army (It will take them decades to replace the lost equipment) + killing 30k soldiers

* Expanding NATO and creating western hemegony like never seen before

* Ruined the future of an entire generation of russians, and caused a huge braindrain where millions of educated russians have fled the country

* Accelerated european energy independence to make sure that Russia is fucked for all foreseeable future

* Dispelled the myth that Russia is a superpower

* Caused a fuckton of internal damage in Russia, by sabotage and forest fires.

And I guess Putin isn't done yet. He still has some more successes he can achieve like:

* Losing Crimea and Donbas

* Turning Russia into a Chinese colony

* Getting assassinated by one of his closest advisors",1653257205.0,1653255594.0,t3_uv33y8,t1_i9m0713,,2,27,0,27,0,0,

Maybe Russia should stop being fucking assholes, and Ukraine might be more pro-Russia?

> Otherwise Stalin would have never given Crimea to them tbh. 

You are 100% right, of course.  But Crimea was NOT Stalin's to give.  Just because it was a member-state of the USSR, doesn't mean Russia could unilaterally portion-out territory to whomever.  It was illegal when they did that. And it was illegal when they decided Belgorod wasn't part of Ukraine back in 1921. (these weren't the only illegal annexations the Russian's did in the name of the USSR). 

(At this point, I'm honestly FOR unwinding anything Russia did unilaterally since 1917). 

>So from a purely geopolitical point of view it makes sense to act now or never. Russia wants that economical and military port/base in Sevastopol.

Oh - absolutely. And if there will ever be such a thing as Ukraine, moving forward, then Russia must NOT be allowed to ""own"" Sevastopol, or Crimea. Period. Ukraine doesn't NEED it, but Russia can't be trusted to have it, because then Russia gets greedy and needs a ""land bridge"", and then they get more greedy, and want everything along the coast, including Moldova (Transnistria), and next is Romania, and Bulgaria, and the European-side of Turkey (Istanbul was Constantinople), Because Russia wants the whole fucking Black Sea, and open access to the Mediterranean.

Even if it is pretty clear they have no way in hell to accomplish this with their current military - they must be fucking stopped. 

Because of all nations in the world, Russia demonstrates why you don't want assholes to have that kind of power.

> Question is why this couldn't be achieved through economical means like continuing leasing the port, or having good relations with Ukraine despise them being majorily pro-EU. 

This is kind of a conundrum. Yes: Russia could have chosen to be ""nice"" to Ukraine, and continue leasing Sevastopol.  They originally had a fairly open-ended deal with Ukraine, but Ukraine voted to end that by 2017 (in 1997).  That's when Russia started meddling in Ukrainian politics: so instead of sweetening the deal to make it worthwhile for Ukraine, they fucking pushed puppet politicians, and infested Ukraine's business with organized crime and corruption, and got that 2017 deadline reset to 2042.  Ukrainians said ""fuck no"" and threw Russia's politicians out in 2014: that's why Russia annexed Crimea in the first place.

>Putin doesn't want former Soviet states to have better living conditions than Russia, because that would make Russia look bad.

It's ridiculous, we need to call Russia's bluff now and put them back in their box. We ramp up the diplomacy, and then when that fails, we take more direct action.

The daft bit to me is that we're still paying for their gas, and playing nice with them. That time seems long over to me. We need to accept that Putin's regime are *never* coming back to the table and there are only two paths from here: either we break Russia, or Russia breaks us. 

We don't want the latter, and the opportunity to do the former is right now. Not in six months, when Russia is stabilising a war economy and checking which military assets still work, now. Before they've had time to take stock of their reserves, fix them, and train people. They were woefully underprepared for a protracted war in Ukraine and the rest of the world seems totally unbothered by the opportunity they're presenting to eliminate the consistent biggest threat to global stability over the past half century.

It doesn't matter *how* we achieve it but the outcome needs to be very similar to Nazi Germany in 1945:

1. Removal of the current Russian regime and political reformation.

2. Liberation and de-brainwashing of the Russian people, including education of what their regime has done in their name.

An ""absolute"" majority is a legal term that means if 66.7% of the parliament/population agrees on something, there can not be reversing a decision in the courts afterwards except for special edge cases.

Good examples are:

* The referendum that ended Apartheid needed an absolute majority to pass, and only white people could vote. It passed with an absolute majority.

* In parliament the ""expropriation without compensation"" bill, allowing the state to ceize farms without compensation or consultation also passed with an absolute majority. Previously the government had to offer afair price for the property and enter into consultation with the landowner, now it is no longer needed.

There are nuances to both examples, of course.

It is also ensconsed in our constitution that any amendments to it needs an absolute majority, and the expropriation bill was the latest (iirc) constitutional amendment.

Interestingly, under Apartheid the citizens, white or black or other, did not have constitutional rights as the country did not have a constitution. Essentially we had no human rights, only legal rights at the discretion of the government.

It is far from ideal, but if you take combat hardened troops, rotate them to the back, promote them and have them train/lead new troops into combat, you are effectively turning them into force multipliers.

Ukraine had 900K reservists and 200K in terms of active personnel at the beginning of the war. Russia brought 200K to the fight.

And Ukraine is currently finishing up mobilization, which they believe will be done in Summer at some point. So those reservists...actually matter for this fight. Whereas Russia stopped replenishing their losses in the immediate sense about a month ago because they're no longer pulling active military personnel from other parts of Russia, and have refused to do mobilization (so far). They're doing all sorts of sneaky workarounds, but that can only get only so many people.  The latest 6 month conscription cycle is going on, but this won't matter for the immediate months as they're being trained.

Regardless of how many people are in the fight at the moment, unless Russia has a meaningful way to replenish their losses (they've stopped bringing in troops from other parts of Russia or Syria to shore up their forces), Ukraine can continue to do so pretty well.

That alone is a large advantage in their ability to stay in the fight.

Lets see what we know. There was a hit on a supposedly military ship, few hours later a ship in Black Sea started broadcasting SRAT CATA signal. This is second highest level interrupt signal it means that a ship is catastrophically damaged with chance of sinking.

When Moskva was hit they broadcasted SRAT SINK one level above it. The ship that broadcasted the signal for 5h was unmarked meaning military.

After broadcast 3 civilian fishing ships moved to the area. Few hours later surveillance drones from US, UK and Turkey diverted massively from their paths and stayed in the area for quite a long time.

After this Russian acted weird, first they tried to pass Essov as Makarov, then they tried the fake satellite image thing but when they were asked to account for Grigorovich they said it was in mediterranean but how did it exit Black Sea since we have it on video firing Kalibr missiles and at Sevastapol.

Finally when Grigorich AIS appeared in Black Sea russian propaganda went quiet.

All of this was visible live in real time in maretumetrafficker btw. What happened after is Ukraine lunched a massive air raid on Russian naval and anti air assets on Snake Island.

Im not saying Makarov was hit or sunk. But many things around this situation are very strange. Since then on marritimetrafficker we have seem Grigorovich and Essov AIS signal appear but Makarov has not been seen for some time now.

Russians also went quiet on it. Even tho Grigorovich by Russian claims was in Mediterranean somehow its AIS appeared in Black Sea.

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,uv33y8,i9mihzu,"Thank you.  My message was obviously not understood at all. 

I was referring to the idea that the war was ending soon.  The US army made quite steady progress and was inside Baghdad in a remarkably short period of time early in 2003.  At the time it was hard to find people who thought it would still be called a ""war"" in 2004. Americans were quite fed up with fighting in Iraq by 2008.  

Wars can be short if the warring parties decide it is time for them to end.  That cannot be reliably predicted.  The public statements from leaders indicate a serious impasse.  The prospect of a near term resolution is low.  Definitely a possibility to hope for but not even ""likely"".  

Material could change some dynamics on the ground.  I would not say ""no effect"".  It often has much less effect on the overall duration than military and defense contractors would like us to believe.  For military the material has a strong effect on how many of them die.  Absolutely no reason to fault soldiers for preferring to utilize large quantities of quality ammo instead of dying.  For the most part it has little measurable effect on the overall timeline.  It should also have some effect on the position held when the leadership finally decides it is time to end it.",False,1653264482.0,t3_uv33y8,t1_i9kw8c9,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

But yes, that is exactly what Russia did. They gambled that they could topple the Ukrainian government before the west could respond. 

They almost did it too. There were Russian troops in Kyiv. But Zelensky didn’t flee, and the Russians failed to take him.

The war dragged on and the west imposed sanctions quicker than Russia thought they would. Also, about half of Russias 670 billion $ reserve was seized by the west. Instead of being able to live on their savings for 12 months, Russia only has enough for 6 months. This way is now 3 months old.

Russia and Ukraine largely share similar tech, and Ukraine is modernising. So far Ukraine has already managed to neutralise a lot of Russia's advantages; this will grow more apparent as they get more modern western weaponry.

Russia is handing out Mosin Nagants, while Ukraine is defending the skies with MANPADs, obliterating tanks with Javelins (and anti-tank guns), and terrorising warships and BTGs with drones.

Weird how the Yanukovych was not supported by the majority of Ukrainians and Zelensky was...

This is incredibly loaded language for the what the Ukrainian government reforms actually did.  The Russian language was not being exterminated. The Ukrainian government was trying to make the Ukrainian language the predominant language of official government institutions and documents as well as the media, while still allowing Russian language media and documents to be published. The reason that media was targeted is that Russian propaganda was being broadcasted heavily in Ukraine, they were trying to reduce the amount of foreign influence.

The Russian language was not being exterminated.

>And meanwhile a literal Civil War raged for almost a decade while western Ukraine bought weapons from nato counties like turkey

Yeah its not great when you're forced to rely on armed nationalists to patrol your streets for security...wonder what made Ukraine consider such methods? Could it be that they were being invaded and assaulted by rebels and a foreign army pretending to be rebels and they were caught without an effective army outside of those nationalist militias because they never expected to have to defend themselves from their ""brotherly slavic"" neighbors?

It is so like an abuser that the world knows that Russia is to blatantly and unapologetically invade one of their neighbors and then blame that neighbor for the method it uses to defend itself, incorporating the act of defense into its narrative for why the aggression happened in the first place.

It absolutely is not. The central hub of Ukrainian identity, Kyiv, has existed longer than Moscow has and ever since the Mongols sacked Kyiv and let Moscow be their vassal, the Ukrainians have had to play second fiddle to Russian aggression and colonialism.

The two have had plenty of mixing and yes, its hard to tell sometimes where the Ukrainians end and the Russians begin (you're probably going to see this blurry area become a lot more distinct over the next decades btw) but Russia has always been the abusive husband in the relationship between the two.

From the dissolution of the Zaporozhian Host to the Holodomor to the annexation of Crimea and now to the invasion of the current year, the Russians have never failed to try to exterminate and oust a culture distinct from theirs in an attempt to Russify it completely.

Texas on the other hand was not always Texas. It first belonged to the natives who then warred with the Spanish who then warred with the Americans in a relatively short period of time until almost the entire state was simply composed of American settlers. Compare that to having about a thousand years of a distinct culture, a distinct people, a distinct language, and a distinct way of government...The Cossack version of democracy on one side against the autocratic rule of the Tsars on the other.

All the bullshit arguments trumped up by Putin and the extreme nationalists that have gripped Russia since that man was handed the country on a plate.  Firstly, Ukraine isn’t in the grip of extreme right wing groups - other than those areas, which have been occupied by Little Green Men and then the violent, thieving and drunken hoards that the Kremlin hopes will bring Ukraine back into the Empire. Neo-Nazi groups haven’t polled much more than 2% in Ukrainian elections since 2014. Russia on the other hand is governed by an extreme ethnocentric nationalist party, which not only suppresses any dissent at home, but murders dissidents abroad and invades other countries to expand the Motherland.

I really don’t give a shining shit about your Texas analogy. It’s completely irrelevant and just a distraction from the crux of the argument. Texas is a part of the United States.  Texans don’t see themselves as being non-Americans. Also, they haven’t broken away from a violent, oppressive state, which had used famine as a tool to destroy any potential opposition, thereby causing millions to starve unnecessarily because of political dogma.

I’m well aware that Ukraine originally meant ‘on the edge/on the Marches, but that’s because the Ukrainians were on the boundary between two large powers, Poland-Lithuania and Russia, as well as the Tatar regions of Crimea, etc. So what? That doesn’t mean that they’re Russian or belong to Russia. If the people of Ukraine are happy to be Ukrainians, what business is that of Russia? Many minorities across Russia are not Russian, but I very much doubt that the Kremlin would support Bashkirs,Tuvans or any other groups were they to to decide they wanted to secede from Russia.  Moreover, It’s worth noting that the war has cemented Ukrainian identity and brought people together, be they Ukrainian or Russian speakers and it’s Russia that has done that. Invading and bombing the shit out of civilians doesn’t exactly endear Russia to people. Just as it’s Russia that has persuaded the people Finland and Sweden to seek to join NATO after a lifetime of neutrality. Sweden had been non-aligned since 1815 and has decided that they are safer in a defence alliance because Russia has now become a threat to any country unlucky enough to find itself too close geographically to Putin’s domain. Congratulations to Putin, for uniting the Ukrainians and the democratic countries and reversing years of seeking to placate and ‘build bridges’ with Russia so as to avoid upsetting the Kremlin!
