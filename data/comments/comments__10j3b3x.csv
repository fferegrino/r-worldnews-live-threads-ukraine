Day 333-334 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past few days were much less quiet than usual, there was a lot of shelling of towns/settlements that are closer to the border and yesterday around 10pm there were some missile strikes. They fired quite a lot of missiles from Belgorod yesterday, most likely at least 4 S-300 missiles in a couple waves. They were audible here in Kharkiv, but the city itself wasn’t the target.

They aimed at Pisochyn this time, which they actually hit relatively frequently for whatever reason. From the photos it looks like they destroyed a small shed, but even then just barely, they accurately hit the ground in between 2 small sheds and damaged both of them in the process. It looks like they might have been aiming at some greenhouses, which were about 20 meters away from the place of impact, but missed.

It doesn’t look like they managed to hit any military targets, there wasn’t anything even remotely resembling a military target in the photos from the place of impact. The greenhouses are see-through, so it wouldn’t make sense to hide military vehicles there in the first place. Sadly, they did manage to kill some civilians while shelling towns that are close to the border in Kharkiv oblast, fucking bastards.

Many details have changed or are clarified, with some new information:

- Budanov knew Kiriev personally since 2009.  Budanov knows he wasn’t a ‘secret Russian agent’ because:

   - He was not simply an agent [ie, not simply a confidential informant, not an intermediary or secret source]...

   - The private banker—while he *appeared* sympathetic to Russia and had Russian contacts—had *actually* been a *full-time employee* of GUR. And, for years. 

   - He was regularly subjected to background analyses, like polygraphs

   - Over that time, Kiriev had worked with several different government agencies. 

- Day of Kiriev’s death:

   - Kiriev first went to see Budanov, from there, he was to go to the SBU, then directly to Belarus for negotiations 

   - Per protocol—since he’s a government employee—he had an interagency detail with him which oversees a cross-agency issues

   - Kiriev, his personal bodyguards, and the interagency employees were going to an interview at the SBU, on his own volition.  They drove to SBU, were intercepted 200 meters from building, Kiriev willingly got into SBU vehicle, he was driven *away from* SBU building, a few blocks further a dead body was dumped on the street


> *Why did the GUR fail to protect its employee?*

> > Because no one expected such a reaction from those people who conducted it. We are not engaged in the protection of our own forces and means, say, from the police or SBU. This is nonsense! Do you understand?

> > And when a car approached, from which *Alfa* [Counterintelligence Department of the SBU] jumped out, instructed to get into this car, Mr. Kireev himself told both his bodyguards, the officers of our Department of Internal Security, don't worry, they are SBU employees, they want to ask me something.


> > Why was he accompanied by two internal security officers: because this is the agency that is responsible, specifically, for aspects of interaction between government bodies.


> > When he was about 200 meters from the SBU building, a van burst through oncoming traffic, *Alfa* employees ran out shouting ""This is the SBU!"", operatives came out, they said that they were from the SBU. Detention was carried out in that form [very unusual since going in voluntarily, escorted by interagency guards].

> > Kireev told everyone with him to hold on. Then he was transferred to that minibus—it went *not to the SBU building*, but several blocks away. Then what happened... And his body tossed out of that van. Those are the facts. Why didn't they proceed to the SBU building? Let the investigation answer this question.

 
- The SBU has not been able to explain or justify anything to Budanov. 

- The “Russian spy” story was planted, to protect the perpetrators, Budanov claims.

- The secret employee—a critical spy who’d saved Kyiv—showing his face seems risky, but he had a different role at the negotiations:

> *What was the purpose of sending him [to the negotiations in Gomel]?*

> > Since the person has already died, we can disclose it: the main task we set for him is **to prolong the negotiations process, in order to buy time**. Because Mr. Kireev personally knew two people from that negotiation process who represented the Russian side.



> *Do you think that the person who killed Kireev had the goal of either disrupting these negotiations or, in this way, weakening Ukraine's position in these negotiations by eliminating Kireev?*

> > I can express absolutely my subjective opinion. I want to emphasize this once again: whoever did this on purpose had the goal of preventing us from dragging things out and delaying the negotiations process [that we wanted] in order to allow our Armed Forces, let's say, to take certain actions to repel the enemy.

A lot of RU claims here. Rybar has reduced their claims of progress on their map to the ""pre offensive"" position around Orikhiv and Mala Tokmachka. RU sources have also made claims capturing Kam'yans'ke.

>The UK government helped the boss of Russia’s murderous mercenary army to circumvent its own sanctions and launch a targeted legal attack on a British journalist, openDemocracy can reveal.
>
>Yevgeny Prigozhin is the founder of Wagner, a private army that the US government last week announced it would designate a “transnational criminal organisation”, allowing it to impose even tougher sanctions on the group. For years it has been accused of human rights abuses and war crimes in Ukraine and across the world in support of Putin’s regime.

>The case collapsed in March 2022, in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But key details of how the sanctioned oligarch was able to pursue the legal attack have remained a secret until now.

>The leaked documents reveal just how easy it was for Prigozhin’s lawyers to obtain multiple licences to pursue the case, with regular personal correspondence from government officials.
>
>Since the invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin has revelled in his public role as the leader of Wagner and its bloody contribution to Russia’s war. He has been filmed recruiting from Russian prisons, persuading convicted criminals to swap jail for a trip to the Ukrainian frontline and the chance of freedom, if they survive.
>
>But until recently, Prigozhin had always denied any links with the group. He was incensed by media coverage that eventually exposed his role and led to sanctions being imposed in the UK and Europe.

""Dear subscribers and guests of the channel! 
 During an operational meeting with the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, which was held on Friday via videoconference, Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to discuss the topic of the second stage of mobilization, stating that no one canceled the mobilization and confirmed that the continuation of the mobilization ""is a settled issue.""
 During the closed part of the meeting, in a narrow format, the president turned out to be more talkative, making several ""progressive"" statements.  Thus, Putin said that it is necessary to implement the idea of ​​a quick effective ""special operation"" against a neighboring country, where victory can be practically ""guaranteed.""  The president considers Georgia to be such a country.  Putin is confident that if an agreement is reached with a part of the current Georgian leadership, it is possible to provoke a conflict by implementing a winning scenario, at the same time helping that part of the pro-Russian leadership of Georgia get rid of ""undesirable elements"" in power.  At the same time, the President of Russia is going to solve the ""Armenian issue"", however, he did not specify how.  Ready-made scenarios of the special operation have been with the president since last fall, and now he has given the order to adapt them to today's realities and submit them to him by February 1.
 Over the weekend, Putin held a series of consultations with people from his inner circle.  The topic for discussion was ""peace proposals"" transmitted through informal channels from the leadership of an influential intermediary country to the President of Russia.  The essence of the proposals is that Putin is offered to withdraw troops to the borders on February 23, 2022.  Further, during the seven-year transitional period of the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine, the LDPR in the territories as of February 23, 2022 remain under the control of Russia from seven to ten years without formal recognition of these territories as Russian by most countries, after which the status of these territories should be settled with  Ukraine.  The demilitarized zone of the border with Ukraine from Russia and the Republic of Belarus, as well as the transfer of war criminals and compensation to Ukraine, are also in the proposals.  To ""save face"", Putin was offered, after the withdrawal of troops to the borders as of the evening of February 23, 2022, a one-year delay with the implementation of other decisions.  It is assumed that the President of Russia will be able to declare this a ""victory"", which will allow him or his ""successor"" to be elected president no later than March 2024.  At the same time, Ukraine is guaranteed accession to NATO in the summer of 2024.  Seven guarantor countries are ready to act as mediators.  These proposals have not yet been received by the Ukrainian side, the mediators are waiting for a response from Putin.  The President of Russia was warned that, in case of refusal, Ukraine would be supplied with all the necessary weapons to defeat Russian troops throughout Ukraine within the borders of December 1991.

We've seen lots of attempts to explain the hesitancy, but so few of the stories add up (logistics? political? inventory control? secret uranium-depleted armor (really? [that's a new one...](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/10j3b3x/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j5ik5xm/)). Many have tried and failed to draw a coherent story about what's going on. Instead of that, let's just see if we can find other plausible new factors which might play a part in this story we can't currently see. I don't think *any* of these are correct as an explanation, just as a factor and as one of many factors I just think they are plausible enough to be worth considering.


**NATO SHIELD DILUTION**

If a subset of NATO countries (say, Poland and several others) join a pact to provide a weapon system T, and Russia attacks one of this subset (say, Poland) with conventional arms, does the *actual* political structure of NATO react to this identically as before? Or would be there division and dissention? NATO -is- the idea that they will respond when asked, but perhaps they would not respond? Or perhaps they have made it clear beforehand that (e.g. Poland) could not request assistance? **[plausability? 2/10]**


**CHINA**

We all know of the various supposed red lines from the Kremlin, basically none of which have remained unbroken. What if the intelligence agencies had an understanding that China actually has a - 
 but a military-industrial supply red line. Perhaps the US believes that if MBTs are sent into Ukraine this will allow the Kremlin to convince Bejing they require assistance. China has [quite a few tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_main_battle_tanks_by_country). On the other hand, they have stayed pretty distant through this whole thing so far. So perhaps it's best to wait until it is the Kremlin who takes the more overt action, so China can not be as easily pressured when MBTs are provided in response to some action. **[plausability? 4/10]**


**WAITING FOR THE KREMLIN**

The US seems to have been following a policy of escalation-in-response during this war. Rarely are the goods provided up front; usually they are provided after an event or series of events (Bucha, partial mobilizaton, apartment bombing, infrastructure bombing, ...). I am sure this is costly for Ukraine, but it may just be the reality of dealing with such a conservative power structure such as NATO (or Germany!). The US may know what steps are about to happen, but they are in a game of chicken with the Kremlin over the timing. To an extent, *this has happened* as we all know both Kremlin officials (including Tucker Carlson) scoffed and mocked the released US intelligence saying they were about to invade. It's possible we know the date ever more precisely, and the Kremlin delayed the action as a way to not be totally humiliated in the intelligence field. But you can only keep Private Constriptovich's attention for so long, once you stage them you have to send them pretty quickly (not quickly enough, perhaps in fact). The same game could be going on now but with an *ongoing* mobilization, so this can be extended out but ultimately I would expect Putin to do whatever we think he's going to do next even if they delay. **[plausability? 7/10]**

We've already seen how China basically forced the Russians into dropping their loud nuclear sabre-rattling over the past few months. Given that these other countries continue to rely on doing business with the West in spite of their anti-Western rhetoric, I think many of them will be privately (or even publicly) urging Putin for a peaceful resolution to this conflict, so that the global market becomes more stable and prosperous once again.

Some could read this as implying that such an arrangement is required in order for tanks to operate in a country. But this is what is required in order for a country to become fully self sufficient for training, repair facilities and internal part procurement.

This is not what Ukraine is asking for, and is not something they would somehow rapidly develop for Leopards. Everyone should understand that external countries will still be responsible for the 3 or so months of tanker training, the 4 or so months of basic mechanic training, and that any part that can't be trivially repaired in the field would have to be shipped out of Ukraine and swapped with flown in replacements.

However, the responsibility of KILLING Ukrainians in WWII lies with the people who killed and enabled the killing of the Nazi regime, and it DIES with them.  For a person born in, lets say, 1980, you should absolutely treat them as INDIVIDUALS in terms of moral responsibility. These people are NOT Nazis and do not have blood on their hands. Treating them as such alienates them and their support.

I do not know where you are from, but nearly every nation, political group, tribe, family, etc., has SOME kind of ugly moral past. If you follow this sense of inherited moral fault, all you get is a cycle of violence and resentment. 

As I stated elsewhere, I do believe the CURRENT German government, and to a degree its people, have somewhat a responsibility to help Ukraine, seeing as they gained from the energy trade that enriched Russia and partly enabled them to run this war.

Ultimately, I would again draw your attention to OUTCOMES. We all agree it is good for Germany to help Ukraine, but I do not believe finger wagging is the best way to get it done.

Again, you don't have any counterargument or any rebuttal, just trolling about which newspaper ran the story.

So do you have any rebuttal to Professor Glees from Oxford who found the documents I linked you to? Or are you just a simple troll?

Remember how, just a few posts up this chain, you said Boris is the ruzzian asset.

And then I wrote a factual reality-based reply, using common knowledge events that actually happened.

Well, do you have any rebuttal? Any counter evidence which we can debate? Or you just want to put apostrophes round his name, call me cheeky and move on?

You have two choices to use it:

B. 10 pcs of equipment take up all of it for better return.

In this scenario resource can be, but is not limited to,  manpower, freight networks, front line logistic chains, clear road/rail routes capable of transporting equipment safely, money, fuel, provisions.

However much equipment is donated by Western countries some of the resource points above are limited on the ground.

I agree with your assessment that where there are limits there is an optimization game you can play to get the most bang for your buck.  


But there are absolute hard limits (total land area, total amount of free manpower) and relatively soft limits (number of trucks, amount of training the west is willing to provide, amount of ammo that can be sourced)  


In my ignorant opinion, there is more than enough rail and manpower and roads to support several hundred western tanks, given that Russia was able to move 3000 tanks within Ukraine with at least some limited success (they managed to capture territory more or less the same size that Ukraine intends to re-capture, and they did it fairly quickly) I don't think even 500 western tanks would push the hard limits of Ukraine.  


But in the absence of someone really in the know telling us, we don't know how close Ukraine is to any hard limits.  


This leaves the soft limits, and these can be resolved with money and time, and to me these are mostly effected by political will. If the west really invested in providing support vehicles, training centers on their own land, data centers for tracking and routing parts then they could help develop a truly formidable logistics infrastructure from afar.
