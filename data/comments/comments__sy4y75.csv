Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:

I will not talk about the past, I will talk about the realities and the future for me, Ukraine, and its internationally recognized borders; and they will remain so shaved despite any statements and actions of the Russian Federation as well. As we remain calm and confident, I want to thank you all our citizens in co3 to prove Ukrainians smart and wise Nastya and despite everything I keep a cool head reacts calmly balanced as an adult. We have long been ready for the spirit but for reasons for your sleepless night. Tonight we held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Russia's actions as a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state is the responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made on Russia's political leadership. Russia legalizes its troops that were actually in the occupied areas of Donbass in 2014 a country that has been supporting the war for 8 years cannot maintain peace as she says. I discussed the situation with French President Emmanuel Macron Chancellor President of the United States Biden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, and spoke with President of the European Council Michel, and still plan to talk with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan what will happen next. We want peace and we are consistent UN request on the basis of the Budapest Memorandum requiring immediate consultations. I initiated the convening of a meeting of the UN Security Council holding a special meeting of the OSCE we insist on the full work of the OSCE SMM to prevent provocation and further escalation. It is very important to see now who is our true friend and partner. And who will continue to intimidate the Russian Federation with words; our partners support us in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter: Ukraine reserves the right to individual and collective self-defense. We distinguish well between provocations and attacks of the aggressor's troops behind us truth and truth. You will never hide from you increase of risks you will know about everything now there is no reason for chaotic actions we will do everything to make it happen in the future. We are committed to peaceful and diplomatic path and we will follow it and only it, we are not afraid of anything and we do not owe anyone and we will not give anything to anyone and we are sure of it because now not the people of 2014 people 2022 very country another army one goal is peace.

Peace in Ukraine.

Glory of Ukraine.

Wikipedia has a neat little section about them, their advantages and disadvanges.

> The combination of different weapons systems including heavy ones at a low organisational level allows heavy artillery bombardments to be laid on more easily and makes them available for use tactically. As such a BTG can engage opposing units out to a longer range than, for example, a US Brigade Combat Team (BCT), which does not have such heavy weapons devolved down to it.
> 
> However, the BTG's relative lack of manpower (they deploy with about 200 infantrymen) compared to a BCT makes it reliant on proxy troops and paramilitaries (such as the pro-Russian militias in the Donbass war) to provide security along the flanks and rear.
> The BTG commander will likely have to communicate with the proxy troops through unsecure and unreliable means such as mobile phones. The limited manpower of the BTG makes the commanders less likely to engage in urban combat than a BCT commander. As they derive their manpower and equipment primarily through the cannibalisation of a larger unit, their sustainability in long-term operations is also in doubt.

Feels like if Putin pulls the majority of its forces back after securing Donetsk/Luhansk, and the immediate danger of an invasion has passed, the west will systimatically have to increase sanctions until Russia relinquishes control of the regions back to Ukraine.

I know it's maddening to watch a tyrant do tyrannical things and seemingly get away with it over and over, but the calculus being made here is that once you go all in with sanctions you have nothing left short of war to threaten Russia with. I know also that this has clear historical parallels to the lead up to WW2 during appeasement - but, consider how insanely bloody that conflict ended up being - even for the victors. Armed confrontation in this day and age between two nuclear powers would end western civilization as we know it. Yes we'd win - but the world we won wouldn't be worth the costs.

It's almost impossible to reason with a nuclear armed nation like Russia. So, for now, the administration is keeping sanctions in its pocket - hoping that the threat averts a full scale invasion of the entire nation.

The huge mistake the West made in 1939, was to create an environment where thanks to their repeated capitulations, repeated calls for peace,  and repeated, increasingly delusional efforts to engage in diplomacy even after Hitler had repeated lied to them and broken agreements,  he ended up thinking that there was no genuine red lines that would provoke war.  Its not that he wanted a war with France and Britain when he invaded Poland, he didn't think they'd do anything.

When they they said they were guaranteeing Poland's territory he didn't think they were serious because based on their previous behaviour, why would he? 

Worse, every time dire consequences failed to materialise and Hitler annexed more territory, any of the people in the german leadership who were worried about provoking war and might have restrained him were increasingly discredited and sidelined.

Meanwhile public opinion in the west changed, as ordinary people saw what Hitler was doing, were disgusted by his obvious lies and their governments' non responses. Public opinion, which had initially been very anti-war flipped as people demanded that someone stand up to hitler.

So you ended up in a situation where someone like the british PM Chamberlain, who would have done anything to avoid a war, simply couldn't back down anymore, because his own party was turning on him, and meanwhile Hitler, strengthened by multiple successes just couldn't see how invading Poland would be any different to the previous times.

What people saying 'but nukes' don't seem to get is that repeatedly backing down from Russia and failing to honour the pledges given to Ukraine about their security is actually making a nuclear war more likely, not less.

Even someone as nuts as Putin isn't going to do something that he believes will cause an outright war with America. MAD works both ways. But each back down increases the chance of Putin miscalculating what he can get away with and doing something the West genuinely can't accept.",1645488450.0,1645486131.0,t3_sy4y75,t3_sy4y75,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Here’s a hot take from the perspective of a Russian. These regions have been rife with Russian supported rebels for nearly a decade. This was bound to happen to sooner rather than later. There won’t be a war in wider Ukraine I don’t think (aside from Putin maybe invading to put a pro Russian president in Kyiv), but Donetsk and Luhansk are now pro Russian, independent states. They have always been Russian majority, Russian speaking regions, with Russian sentiments, the same way as Crimea. Putin won’t outright invade Ukraine because Europe wouldn’t simply stand by and watch. But establishing two pro Russian buffer states in Eastern Europe and a foothold against Ukraine, as well as a chance to flex the Russian military to dissuade Ukraine from joining NATO? It’s too good of an opportunity to pass up.

Edit: damn Reddit REALLY didn’t like that one huh

Edit 2: many mistake my statements as that of one who supports Russia. I do not. I think this is an illegal infringement of Ukraines sovereign rights as a state. The justification for Russian invasion is non existent. But, this is simply how this is being viewed from a Russian perspective. As someone who’s been raised into multiple perspectives, I think it’s valuable to consider all of them. I personally do not believe that this signals the start of a world war, or a Russian invasion of Ukraine, as anything past the establishing of states in eastern, Russian-dominant Ukraine will be seen as a full on invasion, 100%. Putin can get away with this, if he stops here. But if he pushes further, there will be war.",1645492823.0,1645485994.0,t3_sy4y75,t3_sy4y75,,0,-38,0,-38,0,0,

Competent and dangerous doesn't begin to cover it. The guys resume makes him look like a Bond Villain. He literally used to torture people for the KGB for crying out loud.

But part of me wonders if this is what happens when a dangerous psychopath is made leader of great power. He wants to see the Soviet Union restored before he dies.

The reality is this. NATO and the West have agendas  of their own. They are willing to do anything short of war to defend Ukraine. 

Putin doesn't have such limits. He's willing to risk war with Ukraine. I'm fairly sure if Ukraine was a NATO ally he'd go ""Fuck it"" and risk it. It wouldn't be *optimal* for him. He doesn't *want* to fight NATO - I doubt he relishes the prospect of war with Ukraine. But he's already made the calculation that war is a solveable problem. He's confident he can *win*. And that's good enough for him.

And to be clear, I'm not saying NATO will defend Ukraine. We know they won't. I'm saying that even if they *did*, I'm not 100% confident it would matter to him. He'd go 'well. They won't risk WWIII over *Ukraine* '. And go for it.

Part of me thinks he's acting this way because he wants to secure his legacy as the man who salvaged and remade the Soviet Union. It will of course be a different Soviet Union. One whose common idealogies are not communism, but nationalism. One closer to the far right than far left.

But we can't ever really know what goes on inside leaders heads. We can only judge them on their actions, not their motives. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter to young Russian men, or to thousands of Ukrainian civilians if Putin's listening to voices in his head or thinks he's some saviour come to restore the fallen Russian Empire.",False,1645524681.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxxclao,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. Then-prime minister Vladimir Putin's handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months. The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September.

>In 1990, while negotiating German reunification at the end of the Cold War with U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev said that ""You say that NATO is not directed against us, that it is simply a security structure that is adapting to new realities ... therefore, we propose to join NATO."" However, Baker dismissed the possibility as a ""dream"".[156] During a series of interviews with filmmaker Oliver Stone, President Vladimir Putin told him that he floated the possibility of Russia joining NATO to President Bill Clinton when he visited Moscow in 2000.[157][158]

>Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former Danish Prime Minister who served as NATO Secretary General from 2009 to 2014, said that ""Once Russia can show it is upholding democracy and human rights, NATO can seriously consider its membership."" According to Rasmussen, in the early days of Putin's presidency around 2000–2001, Putin made many statements that suggested he was favorable to the idea of Russia joining NATO.[158]

>Russian leadership made it clear Russia did not plan to join the alliance, preferring to keep cooperation on a lower level.[citation needed] In March 2009, the Russian envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, while not ruling out NATO membership at some point in the future, stated: ""Great powers don't join coalitions, they create coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power.""[122]

&#x200B;

It's especially important to get them off Russian oil quickly, as pressure on Russia will weaken the EU economy via increased energy prices.  


But at the same time, Russia's land grab is a big stepping stone to increase their production and supply capabilities to the point where they threaten US's capability to supply and undercut their prices.  


This is primarily via:   
\- The warm port of Crimea giving Russia their only permanently open port.  
\- Controlling more eastern European land to build and defend infrastructure.

\- Climate change causing permafrost thaw in the north sea, making arctic energy shipping cheaper and viable for the first time in history.  


The long-term cost of trying to subsidise the ability for the US to undercut Russia supplying EU energy is going to take a serious toll on the American taxpayers, more so than it already has been till now.  


In regards to Arctic shipping, I believe in the near future there will be a US need to put a carrier fleet in the arctic permanently and work with Canada to defend their northern frontier as a means to try and stop the Russians from trying to claim the region in it's entirety much like China is currently trying to claim the south china sea.

This is a much more tangible threat to the US than I believe is being addressed in media, from a long-term global geopolitical US/Western dominance and security perspective.  
Escalating this into a world war I worry is one of the only ways the US can seek to prevent their own death by 1000 cuts.

Let alone the fact that this puts China in a really good position of sitting idly by waiting for the Americans and Russians to duke it out, with no real cost to them or the potential for them to opportunistically try to take Taiwan.

The Baltics are Putin's most reasonable target, given their lack of strategic depth and Russian regional superiority. Russia will also use naval pressure, for which its global naval exercises are in preparation. France’s impending election, Macron’s desire to carve out a European place in this crisis, and German qualms about confronting Russia provide the Kremlin with two pressure points.

 The Departments of State and Treasury will have additional details shortly. We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments.  
To be clear: these measures are separate from and would be in addition to the swift and severe economic measures we have been preparing in coordination with Allies and partners should Russia further invade Ukraine.  
We are continuing to closely consult with Allies and partners, including Ukraine, on next steps and on Russia’s ongoing escalation along the border with Ukraine.

**Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:**

I will not talk about the past, I will talk about the realities and the future for me, Ukraine, and its internationally recognized borders; and they will remain so shaved despite any statements and actions of the Russian Federation as well. As we remain calm and confident, I want to thank you all our citizens in co3 to prove Ukrainians smart and wise Nastya and despite everything I keep a cool head reacts calmly balanced as an adult. We have long been ready for the spirit but for reasons for your sleepless night. Tonight we held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Russia's actions as a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state is the responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made on Russia's political leadership. Russia legalizes its troops that were actually in the occupied areas of Donbass in 2014 a country that has been supporting the war for 8 years cannot maintain peace as she says. I discussed the situation with French President Emmanuel Macron Chancellor President of the United States Biden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and spoke with President of the European Council Michel and still plan to talk with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan what will happen next we want peace and we are consistent UN request on the basis of the Budapest Memorandum requiring immediate consultations I initiated the convening of a meeting of the UN Security Council holding a special meeting of the OSCE we insist on the full work of the OSCE SMM to prevent provocation and further escalation. It is very important to see now who is our true friend and partner. And who will continue to intimidate the Russian Federation with words; our partners support us in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter: Ukraine reserves the right to individual and collective self-defense. We distinguish well between provocations and attacks of the aggressor's troops behind us truth and truth. You will never hide from you increase of risks you will know about everything now there is no reason for chaotic actions we will do everything to make it happen in the future we are committed to peaceful and diplomatic path and we will follow it and only it, we are not afraid of anything and we do not owe anyone and we will not give anything to anyone and we are sure of it because now not the people of 2014 people 2022 very country another army one goal is peace peace in Ukraine glory of Ukraine.",False,1645490819.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxwjjj1,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Russia never fully left Ukraine after the 2014 invasion - those un-tagged soldiers and local pro-Russia militias have been fighting with Ukrainian forces and pro-Ukraine militias for the past eight years in the region on the eastern boarder.

These areas border Russia and have a high portion of Russian speakers. Russia, as part of its response to the 2014 revolution, backed the separatists and seized Crimea. 

In the years that followed, fighting has continued in Donetsk and Luhansk as the parties have tried to negotiate a resolution. This process resulted in the Minsk I and II accords, where Russia tried to force Ukraine to grant autonomy to the breakaway regions and change its constitution to give them greater influence over national policy. The Minsk accords were never implemented and the fighting continued with various degrees of intensity. Facing the failure of its Ukraine policy, Russia has now built up its forces and has recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent and signed a friendship pact with them that guarantees their security.

China sees this as NATO expansion spurring Russia and wants both sides to take a step back. China believes that if NATO promises to abide by the agreement with the Soviet Union and not expand into Ukraine, then the possibility of war will be very low.  
A few weeks ago, China was optimistic about the matter, arguing that both sides were bluffing. When the U.S. announced the evacuation of its nationals in Ukraine, China asked its citizens in Ukraine to ""pay attention to preventing new local outbreaks of COVID-19."" This means that China does not think there will be a large-scale war. Otherwise, China will openly evacuate its diaspora, as in Libya.  
But the subsequent declaration of ""no military support for Ukraine"" issued by the United States and Europe changed everything. In China's view, NATO has once again betrayed its ally and almost directly approved Russia's offensive. Because all U.S. threats against Russia, including economic blockades, have been in use since 2014, Russia has figured out how to adapt to them.  
In addition, the conflict is increasingly seen as an attempt by the United States to capture Europe's natural gas market. The evidence is that U.S. natural gas exports to Europe rose 40% during the Ukraine incident.  
Despite the exchange of fire, China does not believe the conflict will turn into a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Because from the perspective of Russia's economic situation, they lack the will to occupy the entire territory of Ukraine, nor can they afford the economic cost of occupying the entire territory of Ukraine. So even if the worst happens, this will be a standard ""buffer build"" action.  
China's prediction for the conflict is that it will be a ""battle of Kumsong"" kind of demarcation war even if war breaks out. Ukraine and eastern Ukraine have exchanged fire with each other in battalion-level clashes, culminating in establishing a stable border between the two sides to end the skirmishes taking place since 2014. Like South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Donetsk would be a buffer between Russia and Ukraine.

I don't think they actually have enough amphibious warfare capability to do it, although many people predict that they'll get there very soon.

In the longer term, if Russia successfully captures Ukraine and the response is harsh words and sanctions, China may be emboldened. They would be far better positioned to endure those sorts of consequences than Russia, and they may take that result as a signal that the West and United States in particular are waning in their commitment to preventing regional power spheres from re-emerging to rival the global power of the West. Taiwan could put up a fight, but they have no hope of resisting China alone. If I were Taiwan, I'd be building nuclear weapons right now. They no doubt have the capability. That said, I think China's neighbors and the United States view annexation of Taiwan as far more distressing than Russia invading Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy:  
  
I will not talk about the past, I will talk about the realities and the future for me, Ukraine, and its internationally recognized borders; and they will remain so shaved despite any statements and actions of the Russian Federation as well. As we remain calm and confident, I want to thank you all our citizens in co3 to prove Ukrainians smart and wise Nastya and despite everything I keep a cool head reacts calmly balanced as an adult. We have long been ready for the spirit but for reasons for your sleepless night. Tonight we held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. Russia's actions as a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our state is the responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made on Russia's political leadership. Russia legalizes its troops that were actually in the occupied areas of Donbass in 2014 a country that has been supporting the war for 8 years cannot maintain peace as she says. I discussed the situation with French President Emmanuel Macron Chancellor President of the United States Biden, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and spoke with President of the European Council Michel and still plan to talk with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan what will happen next we want peace and we are consistent UN request on the basis of the Budapest Memorandum requiring immediate consultations I initiated the convening of a meeting of the UN Security Council holding a special meeting of the OSCE we insist on the full work of the OSCE SMM to prevent provocation and further escalation. It is very important to see now who is our true friend and partner. And who will continue to intimidate the Russian Federation with words; our partners support us in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter: Ukraine reserves the right to individual and collective self-defense. We distinguish well between provocations and attacks of the aggressor's troops behind us truth and truth. You will never hide from you increase of risks you will know about everything now there is no reason for chaotic actions we will do everything to make it happen in the future we are committed to peaceful and diplomatic path and we will follow it and only it, we are not afraid of anything and we do not owe anyone and we will not give anything to anyone and we are sure of it because now not the people of 2014 people 2022 very country another army one goal is peace peace in Ukraine glory of Ukraine.",False,1645489828.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxwhvtb,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Other assumed uses include radio positioning and continuance checks, much like how the uk nuclear subs are supposed to nuke everything if radio4 goes offline (that's mostly a joke btw) a loss of signal could initiate an emergency mode. There's also more theoretical uses, by knowing exactly where and when the signal is generated a distant site could use it to analyse atmospheric effects to help improve the accuracy of long range signal monitoring. 
  
One of the most likely and interesting uses however is much more devious, by being so prominent and confusing the numbers stations and buzzers can really help confuse a situation - trying to work out how a system works is much more complicated if you also have to decide what's actually part of it and what's just meaningless junk, they've long been assumed by some to be a a relic once useful but now only maintained to be a mystery.

That changed quickly after the Kursk submarine disaster when people started realising that he was no better than the average self-absorbed and scheming politician who would lie to save face rather than face his own people. Over the years, support for Putin has waned significantly, particularly among the younger generations who aren’t nostalgically fixated in the Soviet times or even the Empire as Putin seemingly is, but older people still tend to support his insane ideology because he represents the staus quo of Russia’s “Glory Days” (yes this is how the older generations see them - most former imperial powers have acknowledged their misdeeds in imperial times but Putin seems hellbent on remaking them in Russia).

Sorry for the rant, but the TL;DR here is summed up nicely by a quote I quite like (albeit back from the Soviet times):

If the regions are relinquished and recognized as independent then Putin will have his buffer states, we will maintain a good shoreline in the Black Sea, and it will prevent more lives lost in the conflict likely to follow if we contest the region further.

At the moment it's looking like Putin's motivation in this ""peacekeeping"" mission in Luhansk and Donetsk is to bait uniformed Russian soldiers to be killed while the region is in a state of ceasefire to justify a push westward.  If that opportunity is denied he will have to fish for some other justification.  As much as I hate appeasement I think these two regions would be worth Ukraine's status as a NATO country.

I could be wrong, sure, but my opinion is based off what I’m seeing in the disposition of forces. Instead of being a condescending twat in return, I’ll help you read a map- this isn’t sarcasm or meant to be a douche.

https://www.reddit.com/r/warinukraine/comments/sunyqj/russian_ground_forces_posture_as_of_february_15/

Without any mil background whatsoever, you can tell where forces are the most concentrated, right? In the north- Belarus- and northeast, at Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk. Now look near the Donbas, to the Rostov region. Far less troops there. They have a division garrisoned there, the 150th, at Persianovka (just north of Rostov-on-Don.) One BTG was deployed there. In total, estimates are that there’s 110 BTGs around the border, with about 80 of them being deployed from garrisons well beyond the border, and 10 more en route. Again, just 1 deployed to the Rostov region.

Narratives aside, media aside, those are facts.

So what’s going on?

Russia divides military responsibilities into districts. North, west, south, central, east. 

What raised alarms for mil analysts in January was Russia moved over 50% of the eastern military district’s (EAMD) combat capabilities to Belarus. This is unprecedented. They have never brought EAMD troops to Belarus even for an exercise. They reinforced them with WEMD and CEMD, and NOMD troops. CEMD troops also reinforced the buildups along the northeast.

The people of Ulan-Ude and Ussuriysk give far less of a fuck about Kyiv than those people from Moscow or St Petersburg. It would make sense to bring them in if their target was Kyiv. 

And it’d also make sense if you were to bring them down that way, that in the northeast, the other buildups could swing down and cutoff the Ukrainian military’s retreat. The dispositions aren’t random.

So going back to the Donbas: what’s going on?

It was a pretext, most likely. Again, look at the map and honestly tell me you believe the Donbas was/is the target here, and that Russia needed 190,000 troops encircling Ukraine- with the majority concentrated in Belarus and northeast of Ukraine-  to recognise its independence. Does that make sense?

What comes next is going to be a complete slaughter.

Edit: also forgot to mention at Kursk, Belgorod, and in Crimea equipment has been marked this weekend with “IFF patterns”- identify friend or foe. They’re going to move in, and it won’t be in the Donbas.",1645487107.0,1645486782.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxw92mz,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

e337da5193a7b9a818082d93d107fad0,sy4y75,hxxdskg,"Note that there is more factors to it but I think these are some big ones. To put it simply, NATO was created to essentially counter the Soviet Union at the time, the Soviet Union collapsed so now you could ask what is the point of NATO? No more Soviets, just separate new countries. When Putin 1st came into power the 1st thing he did was try to join NATO, he was rejected. He tried joining the European Union and was rejected. For some reason they didn’t want them in - what could that reason be. Ok they couldn’t join but were promised by NATO would not expand and they did, they betrayed their word - in fact NATO expanded 5 times - and so they have expanded more and more surrounding Russia while they point their guns (aka so called defense systems) towards them monitoring them and so on. So this could only tell you the Americans are on to something. So again what is the purpose of NATO ? So essentially the US is the one pushing for this expansion agenda, they are the ones poking the Russians and you expect Russia to not react? So you are telling me that yes it’s ok to point your gun to my house while everyone just gets closer and closer. The problem wasn’t created by Russia (at least not the whole thing) rather the American agenda on Russia. Europeans states can essentially only agree, there isn’t much power to say no it’s whatever the US says and that’s all. I’m sure we wouldn’t have been in this position if just the US would have let Russia and Ukraine be. So yes US has started and created this mess and tried this with Georgia and we all saw where that went - it would’ve been better if everything was either left alone or done it’s best to become closer partners between the 2 nations and maybe a buffer state would even seize to exist. If anything China should be dealt with now, they will just keep growing and growing and eventually will become much more powerful then the US. If anything I’d make friends with Russia to prepare for what is to come from China.

And on the topic of conquering in the modern day sense ( since Russia may conquer Ukraine). If you didn’t know the modern way (sneaky way) of conquering countries is essentially through funding coups, rebels groups and so on (Ukraine 2014 actually). Once the take over is completed, US installs their own government, then start the commercialization of the countries resources to serve the US. Yup that what happens - I’m not sure y’all have realized this (although they have failed a few times).

Now remember the US is a global superpower no one else can really claim it except for maybe now China. The US really doesn’t like this, the US enjoys breaking rules and not pay for it, killing many in the process just to establish their ways in other countries through a “we are here to save and liberate y’all mantra” with freedom… ok, I digress. Anyways Russia although isn’t particularly a super power they do have the nuclear stock pile left from the soviets, which still gives so much power when it comes to military might and I’m sure Russia’s economy will grow immensely as time goes by as Russias land is so plentiful. The US does not like this as it sees Russia as a future potential super power, and so the US is dealing with Russia and would probably like to see Russia broken up to smaller states than its current form thru various means like they’ve always done with other countries (Iraq, Libya, Georgia, Afghanistan, Ukraine 2014 and so on) Repeating the process stated earlier. Furthermore, the reason Russia is wanting to “invade” or sort out a deal is to essentially keep that buffer between Russia and NATO. So this is more then just benefiting the US and it’s Allies, its more of a geopolitical agenda against Russia’s literal existence.

Finally - I’m not saying Russia is innocent at all or that it doesn’t have its own agendas but I just want you to be mindful of stuff not covered by western media as the war of misinformation rages and there’s even more to it but yeah - to many goddam layers. The chancellor said recently after the Moscow visit - he said something among the lines of we should build security with Russia not against Russia - this goes back to my first points - I agree with the chancellors comment - if you do this, this would bring everyone closer together.",1645505989.0,1645505038.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxxbc66,,3,-4,0,-4,0,0,

That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.”

As for your main point, nah, not in a million years. I mean look at what happened in 2014.

And it does work, it just means lots of proxy wars, or smaller non nato countries being left on their own. 

Devastating nuclear war is not good for anyone - biden, Putin and Bojo etc all know this. 

The most likely course of action is that Ukraine officially loses an already contested part of their country and it becomes slowly assimilated into Russia; whilst western nations sanction them economically for a while and “strongly condemn” them. A world war is just not really possible these days.

So I suspect things will be escalating *very* soon and we will see sanctions and other things from NATO within the next couple days. Of course I could be wrong. But if Russia truly IS moving into this area, which ***they*** consider independent, something will at least be done. However I do agree with some Russians that these sanctions and everything will do practically *nothing* to Russia, and we (the US) want a war to happen as our country is able to keep afloat and above our debt and economic (and societal) issues due to wars.

Russia will definitely invade Ukraine, I guess the real question is if they're gonna stop after they take the DPR and LPR, or if they're going for full occupation.

I disagree with part of your view. While it is marginally more expensive than hanging out in western Russia or Belarus, Russian troops have been ordered to cross the border of a soverign country on a pretextual peacekeeping mission, despite the fact that some in that region are more sympathetic to Russia and its claims. That incursion and potential occupation alone is hostility and an act of war.  The margin for error (i.e., shooting and waging war) just got that much slimmer.  I suspect the troops are not simply there to withdraw later without further incursions/concessions.

Some people really just want to paint Biden poorly in every possible way in every possible outcome of this situation because they're right wingers. Bias-think in its most obvious form. 

>The whole situation is extremely similar to the Sudeten Crisis. A group of “ethnic German speakers” who happen to live behind the wrong line are being oppressed, so the German government claims them as their own. 

>There’s a critical difference here. The Allies were appeasing Hitler in order to buy time because they had gotten behind on military industry and logistics. Had they attacked in 1938 they would have been outgunned and more unaligned nations might have sided with the Axis. Appeasement might well have been a stalling tactic based on all of the secret information that has now been made public (such as ongoing efforts to create a universal codebreaking  system and early atomic weapon research). We look back at appeasement now as stupid and cowardly, but in the final counterfactual analysis it might have been the right play to win the war. 

>This is completely different to the situation now, where NATO has vastly superior military capabilities to Russia…but we’re living in the age of nuclear weapons. It doesn’t really matter who has more. If any nukes start flying that could very well be the end of human life as we know it. This level of destructive force did not exist when the Munich Agreement. 

>The answer was pretty obvious, Ukraine is not part of NATO therefore NATO stays out of the conflict. 

>Sanctions  may well work. Let’s remember that Russia is a kleptocracy. It will be difficult for Putin to stay in power when Russian oligarchs discover that their assets are being seized around the world and they have to stay in Moscow as the economy plummets around them.

But regardless of those beliefs, the involved states behave as they always, just with new justifications that fit the liberal idealism. By his logic, this maps onto the current Ukrainian crisis as the west pulling Ukraine into it's sphere via color revolution leading to expansion of NATO and the EU, while painting a picture of Russia being the aggressor despite their position as proponents of the status quo against a would-be world hegemon. Mearsheimer sees Russia's response (in 2014) as a line in the sand, essentially a ""if we can't have Ukraine then we'll ensure you don't either,"" and he points to the Georgian war and Russia's success in keeping NATO out of Georgia as proof of both the Russians holding this mindset and it's success as a strategy.

I always know the source when I hear whining about a ""color revolution"".  The fact that the Ukrainian people wanted the economic prosperity and personal liberty of the EU rather than being stuck as a useless corrupt appendage to a dying Russian empire should not be considered some kind of American plot.  It's common sense.  

If they had modern propaganda back in the 1990s, they'd still be claiming Poland and Hungary really want to be part of the USSR.

>he points to the Georgian war and Russia's success in keeping NATO out of Georgia

Ukrainians were clearly fully aware of this history, yet they're the ones who set their policy to aggressively pursue EU and NATO integration.  That's not U.S. policy.  If the U.S. wanted to put Ukraine in NATO, it would have been done 8 years ago.

I guess they could have not signed the paper and gotten shot for it, but most politicians aren't like that. They didn't even invite CIS-EMO observers for the election.

By your logic, the Republic of Crimea's Parliament choosing to separate from Ukraine should also be totally fine then, no? Then what's the problem there?

It's just funny how you think the entirety of Ukraine got sick of their president and how ~300 people can represent them all for such a major decision. Even Trump didn't get impeached after all the shit he had done. Yanukovich ran away precisely because he knew the rebels had control of the Parliament. Those clowns amended the constitution with a simplified vote immediately. This catapulted Turchynov into a significant position of political power, the corrupt ass. Where were you back then? Not questioning these highly legally-dubious actions, I presume.

Ukraine isn't welcome in NATO precisely because the EU and US know exactly how corrupt they really are, but they can still be a good tool in the political conflict with Russia.",False,1645513149.0,t3_sy4y75,t1_hxwb7kg,,7,0,0,0,0,0,

There's nothing to be done about it. Modern geopolitics *depends* upon the notion that Russia wouldn't willingly destroy the planet to get their way. And vice versa.

Thats an assumption. We don't actually know that its true. And there have been leaders in the past mad enough to risk it. We don't know for sure that the leaders currently at the button arent willing to risk it.

But we aren't equipped to *deal* with the alternative.

Putin possessing nukes doesn't matter. Because we can't afford to consider the possibility he'd use them to get his way. Not because he isn't the kind of person who wouldn't use them. But if he *is*, we as a species are screwed beyond the ability to articulate.

If anyone, ever, anywhere, finds themselves in the position to launch a first strike *even though it would be the end of the world*, and still be willing to go through with it, earthly civilisation is essentially unmade. In that moment, even before the nukes start flying.

Our entire world, history and future is negated.

That's why no one, not the peanut gallery and not our leaders, are seriously considering the possibility that Russia would strike first. Because if we do actually live in the tmeline where Putin would do that, nothing else matters. Certainly not Ukraine. We have to work under the assumption that Nukes are off the table, because if they are on the table Extinction is inevitable. 

The truly frightening thing about MAD is that it encourages the proliferation of the kinds of philosophies that would enable just such a person to rise to power.

The only way we as a species have continued to function after engineering a scenario that would essentially end civilisation as we know it, is by continuing to act as if it were impossible. It doesn't matter if that assumption is true or not. We literally can't function if it isn't.

Nobody in all this is seriously considering the scenario that this turns into nuclear war. Not because it couldn't happen, but because it wouldn't matter if it did. Nothing would matter ever again.

No future and no way back.

Either Putin isn't willing to destroy the planet - or he is. If it's the latter he becomes king of all humans overnight and can demand the total annexation of the entire planet and he'll get it. Or the World Dies. There's no in between. And no point in considering either scenario. He'd hold power of life and death over the species.
