{disclaimer: The words I use as examples for similar articulation are based on American English}

Odesa:
 
A-dyessa .
“A” as in caught, or in some regions it is pronounced closer to “eye”. Stress the first “A”


Kyiv:

Key-iv.
“Key” as in key, “iv” as in River. Stressing the first syllable 


Dnipro:

Nee-pro.
“Nee” as in knee. Once again the first syllable is stressed. The “d”, if present, is extremely subtle 

Kharkiv:

Har-Keev.
This one is especially difficult for English speakers. Closing your throat as you would to pronounce “K”, exhale as you would to pronounce “H”. Think of the letter as a hard H or a soft K. Stress on first syllable.


Donetsk:

Do-netsk .
This time, the second syllable is stressed. Do is pronounced as in doughnut.


Lviv:

Le- view.
A short L sound. View is the stressed syllable, pronounced something like “VEE-you”


Kryvyi Rih:

Kre-vuy-reev .
“Kre” as in credit. “Vuy” as in buoy, this syllable is stressed. “Reev” as in Keanu Reeves.


Mariupol:

Maury-oople .
“Maury” like gaudy. Stress on the “oople”, which is pronounced a bit like how “loop hole” is in English.

Sevastopol:
 
SEEva-STOple.
“seeva” is pronoun like diva is in English. “Stople” is pronounced opal. Stress on the SEE and the STO.


Kherson:

Hair-sone .
Basically hair but pronounced with that hard H/soft K mentioned before. “Sone” is pronounced like sewn. Stress on first “hair”

Sumy:
 
Soo-mweh.
With the first syllable stressed, this sounds similar to how an American might say “SUE ME!”, except the me is pronounced closer to “meh”. Though in reality, the “meh” is pronounced with a slight W sound. The best way I can describe it is how we pronounce wet in English; simply remove the T and add an M to the start.


Lutsk:

Lootsk. 
Pronounced like we pronounce loot, just add sk the the end.

Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the security service of Ukraine. 

Russian partatroopers reportedly landed at around 3am local time (1am GMT) and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces.

Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine are coming under more bombardment in the early hours of Wednesday morning as the Russian military steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital.

Joe Biden’s used his State of the Union address to warn Vladimir Putin that he cannot divide the west and that dictators should “pay a price for their aggression”. He won a standing ovation for his praise of the Ukrainian resistance against what he called Russian “tyranny”.

Biden also announced that the US is closing American airspace to all Russian flights, “further isolating Russia”.

Four people have been killed after homes in the city of Zhytomyr west of Kyiv were hit by a cruise missile apparently aimed at a nearby airbase, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the interior minister, said on his Telegram channel.

The southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol are likely now encircled by the Russians, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.

Thousands of Ukrainians are trying to leave Kyiv, our correspondent in Kyiv reported, as Russia’s defence ministry warned residents to leave as it plans to strike targets in the Ukrainian capital. The UN says more than 680,000 people have already fled the city.

The IMF and the World Bank have condemned the Russian action in Ukraine and the “horrifying” suffering of people there. The organisations pledged a $3bn package of support for the country.

Apple has said it will pause all product sales in Russia while Boeing is suspending “major operations” in Moscow, as well as “parts, maintenance, and technical support services for Russian airlines”. 
Ford and the British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover have also suspended operations, along with Nike.

Brent crude oil has soared 5.8% to $110.09 a barrel, its highest since 2014. The Russian rouble has fallen again in early trading on Wednesday to hit 109.2 to the dollar.

My colleague, Dan Sabbagh, reports that an ‘open-source intelligence community’ is already collecting and studying video and photo evidence that Russia’s military is committing war crimes with deadly attacks on civilians and the use of cluster munitions.

Eliot Higgins, the founder of the investigative journalism site Bellingcat, said there was evidence of Russia causing “civilian harm”, including through the use of “cluster bombs in civilian areas”, from credible video and stills of the conflict.

Footage of an attack on a car park in Kharkiv on Monday, described by a Bellingcat researcher as a cluster bomb strike, shows residents walking in a nearby park just as the sequence of bombs go off. The area appears to be residential.

Dashcam footage, assessed by Russia’s Conflict Intelligence Team to have been shot in Kharkiv, is thought to show a cluster bomb landing in a road last Friday. The driver makes a hasty U-turn as explosions rain around the car. Given the lack of aircraft noise, the bomb was probably fired by a Russian Grad rocket system, the researchers conclude.

b24ccfe37728e18cadfb44f81432732c,t4qjju,hz07evy,"Updated recap of the situation based on reputable sources:

* Russia started an illegal invasion under the bullshit pretexts of ""de-nazifying"" and ""demilitarizing"" a country with a Jewish leader whose family suffered from the Holocaust. As the Russians continue to broadcast their ""de-nazification"" propaganda across the world, they seem to be omitting the fact that they've already partially destroyed an Ukranian Holocaust Museum.
* Russia has been vastly underperforming when it comes to their military objectives - the intelligence community seems to unanimously agree on this.
* Economic sanctions have decimated the Russian currency and economy within days, and it looks like more sanctions are going to appear in the following days all around the world. The Russian stock market has not been allowed to open for multiple days, foreign interests across the world are planning to heavily divest, and the ruple has been seeing volatile depreciation.
* More and more Russian oligarchs and citizens are starting to speak out against this invasion, but more and more arrests seem to be happening within Russia by the day.
* China, India, and UAE seem to be the only UN Security Council countries refusing to condemn this invasion, and in some cases these countries have been providing tacit avenues for the Russia to mitigate the effects of these sanctions (e.g. China recently signed some pretty large energy deals with Russia), while in other cases their banks seem to be sanctioning Russian assets in line with Western banks (e.g. Singapore branch of a Chinese bank).
* No-fly zones have been set up in large swaths in EU and NA.
* Negotiations for peace have begun, progress on these negotiations is confidential.
* Despite the sanctions and negotiations, it looks like Putin and Russia are determined to ramp up military operations against Ukraine in the following days, although it seems like the much-talked-about convoy is literally running out of fuel, and Russian logistics overall has been a huge mess. In general, the Russian military has been underperforming in confounding ways that seem baffling even to the intelligence community.
* Russian war crimes are constantly being reported and documented on film. International Criminal Court has already started launching an investigation into this issue.
* There's been a lot of vocal and material support for Ukraine among EU and NATO member nations, but there are no guarantees of Ukraine joining either of the two within a short timeframe.
* Majority of sources from US and EU intel seem to believe Putin is bluffing when it comes to the nuclear option, although there have been some opinions that Putin could possibly be losing it when it comes to mental stability.
* Direct military intervention on behalf of Ukraine does not seem likely from any nation thus far, but Ukraine has been receiving substantial amounts of military and humanitarian aid on a daily basis, including lethal weapons like javelins, drones, and stinger missiles that have wreaked havoc on Russian forces. Unfortunately, initial reports of fighter jets being provided to Ukrainians didn't seem to come to fruition.
* Putin and Russia are unlikely to secure any of their main geopolitical goals before the invasion began, so right now it seems to be a matter of stubbornness and face for Putin.
* The heroic resistance of Ukraine's president and people has united the world's liberal alliance to a degree not seen for decades. Just a few years ago Trump - famous Putin supporter elected with the support of Russian cyberattacks and troll farms - was threatening to pull his country out of NATO. Now Biden and his NATO allies have managed to cripple the Russian economy within days without escalating the war through direct military confrontation.
* Russia continues to gaslight and bullshit to unbelievable degrees, and troll farms continue to operate in full force, but at least Western governments and tech companies seem to be aggressively taking them down.
* There is no purgatory for war criminals. They go straight to hell.

Officials from Ukraine’s defence ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organise a unit of hackers to defend against Russia.

On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organise hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country.

“Everything that might stop war,” he said. “The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country.”

Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians.

Overnight strikes on multiple Ukrainian cities have resulted in deaths and damage to residential neighborhoods, according to reports and government sources. As my colleague Samantha Lock continues our live coverage, here’s a summary of what’s happened in the past few hours:

Ukraine is expected to be a focus of tonight’s State of the Union address in the United States, where Joe Biden will condemn “Putin’s war” as “premeditated and unprovoked,” and tout the importance of NATO and American diplomacy.

At least two people were reported dead and three injured in a strike on a military base in Zhytomyr, in northwest Ukraine, which also reportedly affected nearby homes, with ten private homes damaged, and some of them on fire.

There were reports of heavy bombing in Kharkiv and strikes on residential neighborhoods in Kyiv.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund released a joint statement saying that they “stand with the Ukrainian people” and condemning the “horrifying” attacks they have endured. They promised hundreds of millions of dollars in rapid support to Ukraine, and billions over the next months.

The list of American companies that announced in recent hours they were suspending sales of their products or other operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine includes Apple, Nike, Ford Motor Company, and Boeing.

> For much of the postwar period, Italy has maintained a close connection to Russia. In the decades after the fall of Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime, Italy’s Communist Party was the largest outside the Soviet bloc. The Italian car company Fiat built the Soviet Union’s biggest car factory in a city named after the Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, and also invested in helping the Soviets modernize their automobile industry and infrastructure.

> That strong link to the Soviets spooked the West, and prompted the United States, which helped fund Italy’s rehabilitation through the Marshall Plan, and the Vatican to prop up Christian Democrats who ran Italy for nearly a half century. But during the Cold War, the Soviets exercised arguably more sway over Italy’s cultural intelligentsia, leaving the country divided.
> 
> Italy became a political and ideological borderland in the heart of Western Europe. The country’s leaders — those on the left and the right — maintained a strong alliance with the United States but also cozied up to the Soviets, and then the Russians, for their energy supply. With the rise of the oligarchs, Russia emerged as a market for Italian agriculture, banking and luxury goods.
> 
> But the collapse of Communism and the rise of Mr. Putin as a strongman shifted Russia’s support base in Italy to the right. Mr. Putin developed a close relationship with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who shared his gaudy tastes. Ascending Italian populists saw in Mr. Putin a model for their opposition to migration and the decay of traditional values.

> As those Euroskeptic forces rose, and America’s commitment to NATO eroded under President Donald J. Trump, Mr. Putin, always eager to destabilize Europe’s western front, sought to further boost Russia’s political, cultural and economic ties in Italy. His government welcomed sympathetic politicians to Moscow, supported cultural associations around Italy and wooed foreign investment with talk of Russia’s potential as an export market.

> In the run-up to the war, Mr. Putin personally laid his soft power on thick, spending hours in a video call with Italian business leaders, including the chairman of the banking group Intesa Sanpaolo’s Russian unit, who “categorically” excluded an attack by Russia.

> ...

> Now the politicians who courted Russia’s favor, and attended the Russia Day celebrations in Rome at the Russian ambassador’s residence, newly protected with barbed wire, have found themselves squirming.

> Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Northern League party, which once signed a pact with Mr. Putin’s Russia United party, and who had a penchant for shirts with Mr. Putin’s face on them, has tried to condemn the violence without condemning Mr. Putin outright, and has voiced concern about sanctions cutting gas supplies.

> ...

> Italy’s Five Star Movement, which came to prominence as an anti-establishment force that often echoed Russian talking points and cross-pollinated with Russian propaganda websites, fought against alternative sources of energy.

> One of the party’s members of Parliament infamously suggested that Ukrainians were cannibals, based on a photo that turned out to be from a horror movie. But perhaps its most prominent Russophile was Manlio Di Stefano, the party’s foreign policy point man.
> 
> In 2015, Mr. Di Stefano said the United States, NATO and the agricultural giant Monsanto had conspired to stir conflict in Ukraine to transform it “into a NATO base to launch the final attack on Russia,” but also to sell genetically modified foods. In 2016 he called Ukraine an American “puppet state” and attended a convention of Mr. Putin’s Russia United party.
> 
> He echoed Kremlin talking points to the Russian propaganda site Sputnik — which often promoted his party’s attacks on establishment rivals and is now banned in Europe — and urged Italy to “block sanctions against Russia” in part to help suffering Italian businesses.

> Now, as Italy’s under secretary for foreign affairs, he has become a supporter of the sanctions and a critic of Mr. Putin and Russia.

>Of the 7.86 million barrels per day the U.S. imported in 2020, the majority came from its North American neighbors: Canada, with 4.13 million barrels (52.5%), and Mexico, with 750,000 (9.6%). But imports coming from outside North America are significant. **Russia, with 540,000 barrels a day (6.6%), was the top non-continental contributor**. Roughly 11% of the imports came collectively from OPEC countries, including 520,000 from Saudi Arabia.

Reading this I was also surprised how fall OPEC has fallen as a supplier.

“During the hearing, Rep. Lamborn brought up concerns about Russia, China, and North Korea's missile capabilities.

""Any weakening or changes in the U.S. nuclear declaratory policy must be expressly taken off the table. Europe is embroiled in the largest war since World War II and Ukraine faces an existential threat,"" said Rep. Lamborn. ""We cannot risk dividing NATO at this precarious time. So I implore you listen to our allies and maintain the current strong American-led strategic deterrence posture.""
…
Nuclear deterrence was a main topic during the hearing. General VanHerck expressed concerns that the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence is outdated. He said while he believes in a reliable nuclear triad, he believes that ""our competitors have already fielded the overreliance,"" on this method. 

""Our operating model that assumed we could project power globally from safe and secure Homeland is eroding and has been eroding for more than a decade in order to provide national leaders with timely and informed options that they need to achieve favorable outcomes,"" said General VanHerck, ""We must improve our ability to detect and track potential threats anywhere in the world while delivering data to decision-makers as rapidly as possible, wherever they might be in pursuit of those goals.""

Specifically, General VanHerck listed three strategic principles which he said must be integrated in deterrance:

All domain awareness: From undersea to orbit, to cyber
Information dominance: use of advanced capabilities such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze and process data faster.
Global integration: no problem is regional anymore.",1646198680.0,1646198241.0,t3_t4qjju,t3_t4qjju,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Many of these reports cannot be 100% corroborated by anybody other than the person issuing the report, and many of the sources have a vested interest in obfuscating what's really happening.   While many of these reports may very well be true; many of them may deliberately exist to misinform Russia \*or\* Ukraine/NATO about what capabilities are actually being brought to bear in the theatre or what responses are actually on the table.   Some may exist as statements to pave the way for plausible deniability and the various powers involved going on record as to their official positions.  We have no way of knowing.

&#x200B;

Just keep in mind that any information being released has a purpose behind it.   Much of it can be true, but that doesn't mean there isn't a specific reason behind why that particular piece of information is being disseminated.

Putin sent the lower level troops into war wo telling them they were going to war, just so they would not know details of their mission which they could leak. Then these poor guys go to Ukraine, realize it's not a training exercise and, if they are mentally healthy or normal non-socioparhs, they are psychologically damaged from what they are actually having to do.

As we sit here like ""why tf would putin do that?"" It's because he lacks empathy. He is either a narcissist or a sociopath. Sees these poor guys as nothing more than tools to execute his sick power hungry ego needless war.

Remember when Trump used ....ahem...less knowledgeable or intelligent pawns to storm the Capitol and didn't show up to help or pardon before leaving office? Leaving them to sit in jail like it wasn't his fault? Total sociopathic/narcissist behavior.

THEN...Trump gets wind of Putin's invasion plan and calls him brilliant or genius. Because he personally RELATES to it like a narcissist/sociopath.

As normal people w empathy, we can't relate to these methods. Maybe we can understand that they are sociopaths and that's why they do what they do.

But it takes a sociopathic narcissist to execute both of these examples, and Trump even praises Putin's actions.

Putin should not be in power in Russia. He's a horrible person, displaying sociopathic and narcissistic tendencies in his actions.

Likewise, it sounds like Trump has a shot at getting the republican presidential nomination for 2024.

The Russian people are victims of Putin’s tyranny too. We should be reaching out to them with compassion and truth and not jumping at the chance to kick them while they’re down.

Sanctions are regrettable and necessary. Private citizens jumping in to make them as horrific as possible is wrong.

I haven't been able to function since Sunday when news about Russia's nuclear alert came out. I can't sleep or eat. I have severe PTSD and OCD, and I can't stop having intrusive thoughts and images of everyone I care about suffering in nuclear war.

There have been a couple encouraging things in the last couple days to me:

1) Russia stated that the reason they raised their nuclear alert was in response to comments by Liz Truss about NATO directly participating in the war. I actually find this reassuring because it tells me there is strategy behind them making that move and not just them being complete irrational nutcases.

2) Their foreign minister (or something of that nature) reiterated today ""We still believe that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" This is the core of the nuclear arms pact a bunch of UN nuclear super powers signed at the beginning of this year. Biden and Putin are both on record making this quote, so in context in means Russia is stating they don't want to fight a nuclear war.

---

So with this information combined, is it a reasonable conclusion to say that Russia/Putin are willing to reasonable *at the very least* about not wanting to end the world with nuclear weapons for no reason? Is that a fair conclusion to make and a reason to relax and calm down when it comes to worrying about this?

I'm just trying to be rational about this. None of my coping skills are working otherwise, and I just want to feel like I and everyone I love will be okay at the end of this, and I haven't been able to stop having intrusive mental images otherwise for the last 2-3 days.",False,1646195441.0,t3_t4qjju,t3_t4qjju,,0,-14,0,-14,0,0,

I found [this link](https://imgur.com/a/H3HZK9t), which is admittedly outdated (1994), but still potentially useful for understanding.

Everything I’ve read states Ukrainian has the most mutual intelligibility with Belarusian. It also has a shorter lexical distance to Polish than it does to Russian, meaning it’s more closely related to the former, although a) this only measures partial vocabulary and not syntax or speech, and b) Polish never adopted Cyrillic. Spoken, however, I think Polish and Ukrainian have a higher degree of mutual understanding than Russian and Ukrainian.

Russian and Ukrainian have what is considered “partial” mutual intelligibility. The closet analogs I could quickly come across for examples seem to be Spanish and Italian; although the lexical distance between Ukrainian and Russian is actually the same as that of French and Portuguese, that’s not a highly confident way to measure linguistic distance for the reasons I mentioned above, so you have to look a little more closely at the other aspects of language and add that to the equation. 

Mutual intelligibility is also often asymmetrical. Russians will have a harder time understanding Ukrainian than the other way around. And as many others have pointed out, that may be difficult to measure anyway, since most Ukrainians are bilingual. 

Anecdotally, the rough estimates I’ve gotten from Ukrainian and Russian friends is that a Russian who doesn’t *know* Ukrainian will understand maybe 25-50% of what is being said if spoken to in Ukrainian. A Ukrainian will most likely understand everything in Russian, as most of them are raised bilingual in both (by the way - this is largely due to the banning of Ukrainian language in the Russian Empire until the war of independence, and then the soviet influence spreading the use of Russian as a lingua franca).

Possibly in support of my anecdotal evidence, the current Ukrainian media going out that is directed towards Russians is often put out in both languages, including many of Zelenskyy’s speeches. Doesn’t seem like there would be a need for this if they were as mutually intelligible as some people have suggested.",False,1646199222.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz096z9,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

There's only three things that I can think of that will ground an Air Force.

1. No Pilots
2. No Maintenance

Modern Fighter Aircraft are a bitch to learn how to fly and how to maintain. It's decidedly NOT like riding a bike; pilots can and do forget how to operate systems if they don't use them constantly, simply because there's so many of them. That's why our pilots will fly a ton of hours every month to keep current. Same story with maintenance, I've definitely lost an edge on my work coming back from long leaves. If they've been skimping on the budget for pilot and maintenance training, it's likely they don't have anyone that can fly/fix them.

Also logistical issues; not stockpiling enough spare parts for example, will ground a fleet very quickly, as old jets will break at least one system almost every time they fly. Plus normal wear and tear.",1646197193.0,1646196966.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz0etsp,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

That is probably the larger threat.

So COVID completely derailed the original plan. The original plan was for the US to aid Russia in conquering Ukraine. Trump was supposed to be president still.

In retaliation for Trump withholding military aid to Ukraine, Ukraine “does a terrorism against the US” only this time it really IS an inside job. Russia, wanting to protect peace in the world (irrational thought, I know) begins preparing to invade Ukraine while we mass our response forces at the Russian borders. Together, the US and Russia invade Ukraine and Trump names Putin a forever friend and ally to the US and as a reward for his swift and decisive action in our time of need, gifts Putin the Ukrainian territory. This is completely nonsensical of course but the Trumps response to Covid is what lost him the election thwarting this entire plan altogether. Putin was already committed which brings us to today.

First you have to consider what they mean when they say ""this"" wouldn't be happening. ""This"" does not mean the war, it means average Americans needing to think about the war. They *do not* think Russia would not be attempting to take Ukraine if Trump were president. That doesn't make any sense. Trump can't give Putin what he wants from Ukraine. What they think is that it wouldn't be *effecting us*. 

Trump was opposed to sanctioning Russia, and to arming Ukraine. If he were president now, he would almost certainly still be opposed. As a result, the rest of the world would be far less united in its reaction, potentially leading to another easy annex for Russia. 

This situation is called Negative Peace, and many people prefer it over the harder to achieve alternative.  Negative peace is the absence of tension. It's simple, as it is usually obtained through appeasement of bullies or maintenance of the status quo. Positive peace is the presence of justice. It's hard, it's risky, and it requires change. Many people prefer the former, and that's what we may well have had here under Trump.

Outside of that a large ring of industrial buildings and a lot of identical looking soviet era apartment blocks, probably 15ish stories then as you get across the river or further out it turns into single family homes.  There's a river running through the center of the city north to south so there are bunch of large bridges.  The river has a bunch of large islands, big enough to have buildings and roads on them.

In terms of places to hide from bombs, there's a decent sized subway system, (that seems very deep underground), a lot of big roads in the city center have underpasses and a lot of buildings seem to have basements, there is a huge underground shopping mall right under the main square (although that has a lot of skylights so not great for hiding out from bombs).

We built an effective one in the 1960s ([https://www.britannica.com/technology/antiballistic-missile](https://www.britannica.com/technology/antiballistic-missile)) , though it was limited to 1 location for the soviets and the US by treaty.  It works by shooting a nuclear warhead at the incoming nuclear warhead; its super hard to hit something moving at 8 kilometers per second with a physical projectile, it is much easier to hit it with a 20 mile wide nuclear fireball.  This also will pick up MIRVs and decoys to some extent, because if your MIRVed projecticles are three miles apart when the interceptor gets there it still nails all of them.

Think of the missile command arcade game, and imagine if the projectiles you shot didn't blow up but had to exactly intersect the incoming dot on the pixel to count as a hit.  That's the difference between the two ABM implementations, and is why its such a tough problem even with much better tech.

The big question would be, do we have this built out secretly somehow?

- Putin has been planning this for at least last 6-7 years. 
- Putin/Russia made plans to protect against Sanctions similar to the ones they received for Crimea and were caught off guard by these heavy sanctions. (The 600 billion dollar war chest says as much) 
- I think Putin planned to have Trump in Office and pulling out of NATO during this but that failed and had to make due without. 
- Thought Germany and Italy would splinter from West in Sanctions due to reliance on gas, and the change in governance of Germany threw a wrench in his plans as Merkle was in charge for so long she was more predictable to Russia. 
- Vastly underestimated the societal changes in post Crimea Ukraine. I think he thought he would receive similar support in the east as he did in Crimea from locals. However years of war unified Ukraine's national identity. 
- Overly compartmentalized his plans in his own government to the point that his army was not prepared and thought it was only training. Leading to all the issues with supplies, battle plans, coordination that we are now seeing. 
- Has been isolated for the last 2 years due to covid leading to a more paranoid and emotional mental state. 
- Overestimated USA weakness and war wariness. We aren't at war but we are still fractured domestically which he probably thought would gridlock US action.
- Underestimated Zelenskyy, he assumed Zelenskyy would flee the day of the invasion and Ukrainian command and control would evaporate after that letting his troops walk into the capitol and install a puppet government. 
- Lacked foresight to give himself an out if things went as wrong as they have and is now stuck and facing the end of his rule in disgrace and trying to find something he can claim as a win. 
- Expected more support form China, they have done their normal policy of neutrality and seem to be slowly turning against Russia now that it is becoming a geo political blunder. 
- Is old and tried to leave his mark on Russian history. Had this gone better for him he would have gone down as a Russian great, now he is facing being remembered as the man that destroyed the Russian economy and a madman. 
- Stuck in his KGB views of how the modern world works. 
- Surrounded himself with yesmen and those he doesn't fully trust, leaving him in a echo chamber.

Everyone says that the Ukrainian forces are holding them at bay, and Russians are inept with shit equipment and ancient hardware. I just don't see it. They seem to be purposefully holding back. Taking their time. 

They do want ukraine as part of Russia, so obviously they're not going to annihilate their entire infrastructure. They've advanced on cities only to be ""repelled"" by Ukrainian forces time and time again? I'm sorry, but as brave and fierce the Ukrainians may be, the Russian forces seem to be probing more than anything. Waiting them out a bit before slowly overtaking them.

Everyone thinks that the Russians have failed because they didn't take the country overnight. But what if that's not their strategy? What if they are in this for the long haul, and are going to grind the advance instead of sprint? The Ukrainians are on the defensive and digging in their heels. If Russia wanted to blitz them there would be a huge clash. Instead, we've seen a very slow moving advance from all sides but the west. 

And Kiev really hasn't even been touched. You're telling me that they're holding back the Russian forces who are what, 15-20 miles out? Everyone wondering why the convoy hasn't run through the city yet, but what if that isn't the plan? Wait for the slow advance from the south and east, hold Ukraine from throwing all their forces at those fronts with their massive convoy on their capital's doorstep, and then just choke the city off.

I don't know, my head has been all.over the place on this. So, so much pro-Ukraine propaganda for obvious reasons, but some of it has been dubious to me. I mean, if you read through these threads, you'd think they were on the verge of pushing the Russian forces all the way back to Moscow. But slowly, every day, the Russians and closing in. 

And with Putin reminding everyone that he has nukes, he's all but guaranteed that the west will only intervene with aid and economic sanctions.  How long is that aid going to continue to flow in? If Kiev is completely surrounded and cut off, how does it even get in? The economic sanctions are crushing them, but there is no fucking way Putin didn't plan on them like many are saying. He thinks they can find a way to survive with them in place. It really seems to me that he, and most likely the majority of those in his circle, believe so strongly that Ukraine is a part of Russia that they are willing to sacrifice their economy in order to take it back. And, justified or not, they also obviously fear Nato expanding to their doorstep.

I really think everyone is looking at this the wrong way. They aren't trying to quickly beat the shit out of Ukraine. They're slowly trying to strangle them into submission.

Or maybe I'm drunk and shit posting and sleep deprived and it's true that they actually are a paper tiger, and Putin is an inept madman. Don't even know anymore. Just know that I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep over the past week, and am very worried for my friend's family who lives in UA. I'm really starting to believe that they're sandbagging it here, but hopefully I'm wrong. Any hey, just felt like writing up some thoughts.

Tonight, we meet as Democrats, Republicans, independents, but most importantly, as Americans with a duty to one another, to America, to American people, to the Constitution. And an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.

(APPLAUSE)

Six days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world. Thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways, but he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he was met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people.

(APPLAUSE)

President Zelenskyy — to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their determination literally inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees to teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. In the struggle, President Zelenskyy said in his speech in the European parliament, light will win over darkness. The Ukrainian ambassador to the United States is here tonight sitting with the first lady. If you are able to stand, please stand and send an unmistakable signal to the world. Thank you.

We, the United States of America, stand with Ukrainian people. Throughout our history, we have learned this lesson. When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. The cost to America and the world keeps rising.

ADVERTISEMENT
That is why the NATO alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War II. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.

Putin's latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated, repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO would not respond. He thought he could divide us at home in this chamber and this nation and he thought he could divide us in Europe as well, but Putin was wrong. We are ready. We are united and that is what we did. We stayed united.

We prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building coalitions of other freedom loving nations in Europe and the Americas to the Asian and African continents to confront Putin. Like many of you, I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how we would try to falsify and justify his aggression.

We countered Russia's lies with the truth, and now he has acted, the free world is holding him accountable along with 27 members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, even Switzerland inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than he has ever been.

(APPLAUSE)

Together, along with our allies, we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We are cutting off Russia's largest banks and international financial system preventing Russia's central bank from defending the Russian ruble, making Putin's $630 billion war fund worthless.

We are choking Russia's access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come. Tonight, I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who built billions of dollars off this violent regime, no more.

(APPLAUSE)

I mean it. The United States Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of the Russian oligarchs. We are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We are coming for you. Tonight, I am announcing we will join our allies in closing off American airspace to all Russian flights, further isolating Russia and adding an additional squeeze on their economy.

He has no idea what is coming. The ruble has already lost 30 percent of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40 percent of its value. Trading remains suspended. The Russian economy is reeling. Putin alone is the one to blame. Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance, economic assistance, humanitarian assistance. We are giving more than a billion dollars of direct assistance to Ukraine and will continue to aid Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering.

But let me be clear. Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight Ukraine but to defend our allies in the event Putin decides to keep moving west. We have mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. As I have made clear, the United States and our allies will defend every inch of territory that is NATO territory with the full force of our collective power. Every single inch.

(APPLAUSE)

We are clear eyed. Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. The next few days, weeks and months will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield, he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a pound of Ukrainian people — the proud people pound for pound ready to fight with every inch they have. They have known 30 years of independence. Have repeatedly shown they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

To all Americans, I will be honest with you as I always promised I would be, a Russian dictator invading a foreign country has cost around the world and I am taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanction is targeted at the Russian economy and we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.

Tonight, I can announce the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort. Releasing 30 million barrels from our own strategic petroleum reserve and we stand ready to do more if necessary. United with our allies. These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. I know news about what is happening can seem alarming to all Americans.

But I want you to know we are going to be OK. We are going to be OK. When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war in Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

(APPLAUSE)

While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what is at stake, now everyone sees it clearly. We see the unity among leaders of nations, a more unified Europe, a more unified West. We see unity among the people gathering in cities and large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for the people of Ukraine.

The battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment. The world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. This is the real test. It is going to take time. Let's continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forged a deep bond that connects our two nations, we stand with you. We stand with you. Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks but it will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. He will never extinguish their love of freedom, and he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.",False,1646196421.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz0do2w,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

You can't rule over society if there's no society to rule over, and all economies fall to ruin because no one's alive to run them. You can't be rich when your material wealth is burnt to nothing. You can't be God-King of the Soviet Union if NATO decides to nuke your entire country in retaliation - your life, the life of any minions who obey you, and the life of any people you'd subjugate. Gone. Now, Putin would be God of Nothing. 

And he knows this. He threatens nuclear war because he knows that OTHER leaders know this. Nuclear warfare would destroy the world - including themselves. He's betting that others leaders are too chicken to challenge him, as he's been notoriously stone-faced, cold and calculated his entire tenure. Nothing phases him - which makes him hard to predict whether he's serious or able to be reasoned with.

Largely you are expected to have military experience, practically I have heard that if you are competent you will be allowed. That means not being a liability, being adequately fit, being able to handle weapons, being able to carry heavy loads, having basic survival skills. Being able to work with a team is imperative, moving with a group in a combat setting. Things you learn during basic in essence

The following steps detail joining the Ukrainian international Defense Legion.

'1) Apply to the Embassy of Ukraine in your country with the intention of joining the Foreign Legion of Territorial Defense of Ukraine (ask a military diplomat or consul for details). Applicants can visit the Embassy in person, call or send an email to start the process.

'2) Get your documents in order. This includes an ID, a passport to travel abroad, documents confirming military service or work with law enforcement agencies and participation in combat. (If none or limited experience you will get grilled in an interview to see if you're competent enough and won't be a liability).

'3) Arrive at the embassy with documents for an interview with the defense attaché and the settlement of any visa issues with the consul. 

'4) Write an application for enlistment in the Territorial Defense of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for military service under a contract on a voluntary basis. (This is in addition to Step 1.)

'5) Receive instructions on how to arrive in Ukraine and what to bring. Military clothing, equipment, helmet, body armor, combat gloves, tactical glasses, belts and vests are recommended. “It is not obligatory,” the official said, “but a foreign soldier in his national uniform looks good for the International Legion.”

'6) Go to Ukraine in an organized manner. Representatives of Ukrainian embassies, consulates (abroad) and Territorial Defense in Ukraine will provide assistance on the way. Contacts will be provided at the Embassy of Ukraine in your country.' ",1646202429.0,1646201149.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz0m248,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

The fact that you are afraid shows this can be effective. But the point is not nuclear war at all — it's to make you afraid, so they look stronger. So it's fundamentally dishonest, like everything they say.

Putin plays with words to manipulate people, because it he's good at it and it works. 

Only this time it didn't, in a very bad way for him. So he tries again, now talking about more and more dramatic, emotional things until it draws the reaction he wants.

With the payloads maintained by the world today, even if every single one of them went off (even the USs themselves)  in its own 100x100 mile square, on US soil, only 1/2 the US would be effected. There are only enough nukes atm to damage 1/38th of the Earth's land, and most nukes now penetrate dozens to hundreds of feet into the earth before detonating, concentrating their damage on the target and reducing damage to the surrounding area by 10x-100x. 

On another note, when world powers go to war, people die. Neither you or I nor your family nor my children are exempt from living through history. Ukranian familes are dying right now. You are not exempt from that risk, though you and I are very lucky to be less likely to suffer it. You and I are not special. But we are fortunate.

The west will never start a nuclear war, and the russian government wouldn't let Putin even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.

So go do whatever you need to do. If Ukrainians can do it when their families are actually being split apart and dying, then you can do it from the comfort of western civilization. There will be no nuclear war, anyone who says otherwise is trying to sway popular opinion within NATO.

It’s not much different from other places. One big difference from the US is that there are very few black people in Ukraine. What happened with international (mostly African and Indian) students at the border was horrible, but there were many factors at play: 
1) Yes racism, especially using skin color as a way to separate foreigners from Ukrainians. 
2) Nationalities and visas. Our neighboring countries immediately announced that they would accept Ukrainians entering their border so it was a clear cut immigration situation for them. Foreign students without EU visas were initially told they need to arrange humanitarian entry with their governments and some countries were fast to respond and others weren’t. There was a lot of miscommunication. It’s unfortunate that bureaucracy was prioritized over humanitarian assistance but this is just the reality of immigration almost everywhere in the world. 
3) The border is CHAOS right now. I’ve heard from many Ukrainians who couldn’t get public transportation, had to walk huge distances in the freezing cold and wait to cross the border in horrible conditions. There’s a bottleneck at every border crossing. Children crying because they have to leave their fathers behind. Elderly people passing out from cold and fatigue. People in these situations do not show their best selves. And trust me, it wasn’t only students of color who couldn’t get buses, had to wait in the cold, got screamed at by border police. It’s an ugly situation. I have relatives who have been waiting for days. 
4) I see from social media that African students are praising the reception they have received in Poland and Romania. As someone who’s been to both of these countries, I didn’t get the impression that they are any less racist than Ukrainians. The difference is that their countries aren’t in war torn shambles right now. 

Anyways, I’m donating to all relief efforts, including groups trying to get international students out of Ukraine. It’s a horrible situation and I think we all need to come together to stand against the real enemy.",False,1646197336.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz0dnd7,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

1/ to harm a country's leadership politically by causing it to lose popularity or experience civil unrest.

2/ to degrade a country's ability to wage war by forcing it to divert funds in its shrinking budget from the military to civilian needs to forestall the above.

3/ to provide an incentive to change policy to avoid the first or second consequence.

The most obvious indication of success is in response to #3, a direct about-face on the triggering policy. I doubt we'll see that here given the stakes, but if we see it we'd likely see it pretty quickly-- days, maybe weeks.

The next most obvious is in response to #1. This will play out over the course of months and we can measure that by looking at general measures of unrest, satisfaction, approval ratings, etc. Some of those will be heavily distorted, but it's pretty hard to hide a widespread softening of support. By the end of a year or so if that hasn't happened, we'll know we didn't accomplish that goal.

Finally, you have long term sanctions like what we did to Cuba. These basically don't lift without regime change, because the goal is just to put down an adversary and the moment you lift off their neck they're going to come swinging at you again.

Not necessarily.

> Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture, is a process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity **without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing**. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and property such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the *thing* is suspected of being involved in a crime. **To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity.**

Putin has been throwing his weight around and getting away with it for years now. I can almost see how he thought he was going to pull this off. The problem is he surrounded himself with sycophants and lost touch with reality. His military is not up to the standard he had been led to believe by people who were scared to anger him and so lied instead. Those same type of people probably also told him he was/is very popular in Ukraine and many to most Ukrainians would welcome the Russians as liberators and/or roll over like dogs. He didn't realize he was repeating historical mistakes until it was too late.

I think everyone underestimated Ukraine though. Just because it was described as a ""low level"" conflict people forgot that these dudes have been fighting for the better part of a decade now. They have combat experience, they just needed the weapons. Russia could still take over the country, but it's gonna be a slog and they will probably have to bring in a lot more forces than they initially planned on.

 >Kievan Rus' (Old East Slavic: Роусь, romanized: Rusĭ, or роусьскаѧ землѧ, romanized: rusĭskaę zemlę, ""Rus' land"") or Kyivan Rus', was a loose federation of East Slavic, Baltic, and Finnic peoples in Eastern and Northern Europe from the late 9th to the mid-13th century, under the reign of the Rurik dynasty, founded by the Varangian prince Rurik. The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. The Rurik dynasty would continue to rule parts of Rus' until the 16th century with the establishment of the Tsardom of Russia.

The russian chief of staff was fired two days ago by putin, presumably in a fit of towering rage over logistics failures.

So instead of trying to be cute like they were, they're being super safe. But all those vehicles want to move at different speeds. They don't all refuel at the same time. Some refuel more often than others. Flat tires. Radiators blown. Driver falls asleep, tank goes off bridge. (Actually happened, tho not this convoy.) Starter goes. Raid warning, everyone stop, soldiers disperse. Soldiers get back in truck. Did I see a drone? Did you? Where? STOP THE TRUCK!

We're in a period of unprecedented unity, but I'm not 100% certain that will hold true long enough.

Let me present a hypothetical to illustrate why citizens can easily lose their nerve.

""We view these sanctions as an act of war - they are threatening our national security - remove them now or we will respond with nukes; if the Russian state cannot exist then there is no need for the world to exist""

In the event something like this gets said (and keep in mind that, something similar has been said already in two separate parts, just not explicitly with nukes), how likely is it that the citizens here will stick to their guns and call the bluff? Me, personally, I'm guessing a substantial portion won't based on comments within these live threads (and hey, like I get that, potential for everyone dying is scary)

That being said, I do acknowledge that it's likely that Putin saying something like this would be catalyst for people in Russia to rise up and overthrow him and/or such orders get disobeyed (because chances are they don't want to die in nuclear fire either) so such a statement is unlikely to ever actually be followed through on imo.

 >The name Ukraine (Ukrainian: Україна, romanized: Ukrayina [ʊkrɐˈjinɐ] (listen), Вкраїна Vkrayina [u̯krɐˈjinɐ]) was first used in reference to a part of the territory of Kievan Rus' in the 12th century. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the 12th century, referring to numerous lands on the border between Poland and Kievan Rus' or its successor states. The use of ""the Ukraine"" is officially deprecated by the Ukrainian government and many English language media publications. Ukraine is the official full name of the country, as stated in its declaration of independence and its constitution; there is no official alternative long name.

 >The big lie (German: große Lüge) is a gross distortion or misrepresentation of the truth, used especially as a propaganda technique.

Hitler claimed that the technique had been used by Jews to blame Germany's loss in World War I on German general Erich Ludendorff, who was a prominent nationalist political leader in the Weimar Republic.

At the end of the Second World War, U.S., British, and Soviet military forces divided and occupied Germany. Also divided into occupation zones, Berlin was located far inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. The United States, United Kingdom, and France controlled western portions of the city, while Soviet troops controlled the eastern sector. As the wartime alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union ended and friendly relations turned hostile, the question of whether the western occupation zones in Berlin would remain under Western Allied control or whether the city would be absorbed into Soviet-controlled eastern Germany led to the first Berlin crisis of the Cold War. The crisis started on June 24, 1948, when Soviet forces blockaded rail, road, and water access to Allied-controlled areas of Berlin. The United States and United Kingdom responded by airlifting food and fuel to Berlin from Allied airbases in western Germany. The crisis ended on May 12, 1949, when Soviet forces lifted the blockade on land access to western Berlin.",False,1646193177.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz07mjr,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

> More on how long Ukraine may withstand Russian assault
A U.S. official tells CBS News that a tactical seizure of Ukraine is possible within the next 4-6 weeks, based on the assessments of what is currently taking place on the ground with the Russian military. 

> As David Martin has reported, it is expected to take one week before Kyiv is surrounded, and another 30 days could elapse before Ukraine's capital is seized. This U.S. official says it is not clear whether Russia would gradually strangle the city or engage in street-to-street fighting. These scenarios were laid out for members of Congress Monday as the initial battle to destroy the Ukrainian military and government. It is also not clear whether Russia would then decide to go west toward Lviv or as far west as the Polish border.

> The situation is dynamic, so this remains an estimate on what is militarily possible. This U.S. official also could not say when the sanctions that have been rolled out so far will have a practical impact on the Russian military. The low morale and shortages of food and fuel are not a result of the sanctions now in place. At some point, however, the Russian military will be impacted by the sanctions.

> Given the durability of the Ukrainian resistance and its long history of pushing Russia back, the U.S. and Western powers do not believe that this will be a short war. The U.K. foreign secretary estimated it would be a 10-year war. Lawmakers at the Capitol were told Monday it is likely to last 10, 15 or 20 years — and that ultimately, Russia will lose.",False,1646196450.0,t3_t4qjju,t1_hz0dyx9,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

 >On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine, one of its neighbours to the southwest, marking an escalation to a conflict that began in 2014. Following Ukraine's Revolution of Dignity in 2014, Russia had annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatist forces had seized part of the Donbas in eastern Ukraine, leading to an eight-year war in the region. Some reports called the invasion the largest conventional warfare attack in Europe since World War II. Starting early in 2021, Russia built up its military around Ukraine's borders with Russia and Belarus.
