> * Ukraine has likely captured at least 440 Russian Main Battle Tanks, and around 650 other armoured vehicles since the invasion. Over half of Ukraine‚Äôs currently fielded tank fleet potentially consists of captured vehicles.

> * The failure of Russian crews to destroy intact equipment before withdrawing or surrendering highlights their poor state of training and low levels of battle discipline.

> * With Russian formations under severe strain in several sectors and increasingly demoralised troops, Russia will likely continue to lose heavy weaponry.

Day 226 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they fired missiles from Belgorod twice; the first time was at 7:55pm, we don‚Äôt know where those went, no reports about them landing somewhere followed. Then they fired their missiles for the second time at 12:30am, and this time they targeted Kharkiv, they fired 4 missiles in total, 2 per target, a large fire started at both places that were hit.

At one of the places that was hit people were hearing secondary explosions, so they might have hit some ammo dump, which would be *the first time during this war that they managed to hit a military target inside Kharkiv* after firing hundreds of missiles at us, probably even more than a thousand if we count MLRS rockets. I‚Äôve been here since the start of the war, and this is the first time we had any secondary explosions inside Kharkiv, though we couldn‚Äôt personally hear them, because the place that was hit is too far from us.

But there‚Äôs actually another possibility, and it might not have been an ammo dump that was exploding, though we can‚Äôt rule that out either. Our mayor said that 2 places were hit, *a medical facility* and a non-residential building. So the second possibility is that, if they hit a hospital, the stuff that was exploding might have been oxygen tanks and not ammo. We will know for sure tomorrow, it could have been an ammo dump in that other non-residential building, but Russians are not known for hitting military targets often, so the hospital theory still stands.

Russian soldiers moved into pig shed in Kherson village amid widespread damage to other property, Ukraine says

  
***From CNN's Victoria Butenko and Nick Paton Walsh***  
  
The Ukrainian security service says that some Russian soldiers in one occupied village in the southern Kherson region moved into a pig shed because of a lack of alternative accommodation.  
  
The Russians had occupied the village of Lyubymivka, the security service said, where about 70% of the buildings had been destroyed during shelling.  
  
While Russian officers had taken over private houses, some of the soldiers had lived on a pig farm. Local people had led the security service to the farm. Video and images provided to CNN by the security service show that soldiers had slept and eaten in the pig shed.   
  
Lyubymivka was liberated earlier this week as Ukrainian forces pushed south through rural areas ok Kherson.  
  
What CNN saw on the ground: CNN visited the village this week and found that a school house being used by the Russians had been hit. The CNN team also found that Russian soldiers had also been living in a children's recreational center.  
  
The security service said that there were about 200 civilians left in the village when it fell. During the occupation, locals had been banned from being outdoors after 6 p.m. local time. It said Russian soldiers had taken food and alcohol from local people and had hidden their weaponry in residential areas so that it would not be detected by Ukrainian drones.  
  
**The security service also said that it had found stolen washing machines at the pig farm.**",False,1665164138.0,t3_xxp21a,t3_xxp21a,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

Ukrainian troops liberated another bunch of villages in Kharkiv and Kherson Oblast, but the pace has slowed down.

Ukrainian forces continues to advance and secure settlements alongside Oskil river. They recently announced the liberation of Hlushkivka.

**Svatove direction:**

Ukrainian units liberated Makiivka settlement.

Clashes are ongoing on the streets of Bakhmutske and Soledar.

Russian units advanced by a few meters towards Bakhmut.

They also managed to enter Vesela Dolyna and the nearby Zaitseve. Ukrainian units retreated from both settlements amid the worsening situation. 

However, both areas are marked as contested.

Russian forces captured Odradivka and Mykolaivka Druha.

**Donetsk front:**

Russian troops attempted to break through Ukrainian lines north of Avdiivka and assaulted towards Krasnohorivka, Vesele and Kamyanka. No success.

Russian forces also intensified its offensive south of Donetsk. Ukrainian forces managed to repel the attacks towards Novomykhailivka, Pobieda and Vodyane.

And finally, Ukrainian units liberated Tryfonivka in the northern part of Kherson Oblast.

In retrospect, that was actually a pretty massive political mistake too.

Euromaidan and the events at the early end of the crisis were generally viewed in Eastern Ukraine as being perpetrated by a more pro-EU western Ukraine, and the same applies when you look at a map of the [turnout for the 2014 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_presidential_election#/media/File:–Ø–≤–∫–∞_–≤–∏–±–æ—Ä—Ü—ñ–≤_–Ω–∞_–ø–æ–∑–∞—á–µ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–∏—Ö_–≤–∏–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ö_–ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞_–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏_2014_–ø–æ_–æ–∫—Ä—É–≥–∞—Ö.PNG). Poroshenko won everywhere due to the lack of a true unified alternative and like four candidates running against him instead, but turnout was drastically higher in the west than in the (at the time) less pro-EU east.

Meanwhile, [take a look at the map for the 2019 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election#/media/File:2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election,_round_2.svg). Look at the areas where the vote was the highest for Zelenskyy.

Putin didn‚Äôt just wait to invade until the AFU could genuinely counter Russian forces, he also waited until the primarily western Ukraine-backed Poroshenko was replaced with a native Russian-speaker commanding significant popularity in eastern Ukraine, the exact regions Russia was/is trying to claim are being ‚Äúoppressed.‚Äù

Austrian journalist, [Armin Wolf]( https://www.politico.eu/blogs/on-media/2018/06/armin-wolf-the-art-of-taking-on-vladimir-putin/), asked Putin some pointed questions in a [2018 interview](https://www.arminwolf.at/orf-vladimir-putin-interview-full/).  Paraphrased below.  

Wolf:  Your chef runs a troll factory.  
Putin:  I have many acquaintances. What he does is none of my business.  

Wolf: You and Trump talk on the phone often.  
Putin: Yup.  

Wolf: So, North Korea.  
Putin:  South Korea and North Korea should both disarm.  

Wolf:  Russians shot down a plane full of Dutch and Australian humanitarian doctors over Ukraine in 2014.  
Putin:  Malaysia doesn‚Äôt think we did it.  Maybe Ukraine is responsible.  

Wolf:  You denied sending Russian soldiers to Crimea in 2014, then admitted it.  
Putin:  They were there by invitation.  Just helping with security for a vote for independence.  

Wolf: ‚ÄúWhat should happen in order for Russia to return Crimea to Ukraine?‚Äù  
Putin: ‚ÄúThere are no such conditions and there can never be.‚Äù  

Wolf:  Poland and the Baltics don‚Äôt want territories annexed the way Crimea was.  
Putin:  Territories should be able to break away even if their governments disagree.  

Wolf:  Well, what if Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia want to separate from Russia?  
Putin:  Chechens are happy with our current arrangement.  

Wolf:  If Ukraine stays out of NATO, would there be peace with Russia?  
Putin:  Maybe if there were no military facilities in Ukraine.  We don‚Äôt want them pointing anything at our nuclear stuff.  

Wolf:  Syria uses chemical weapons.  Why are you blocking UN inspectors there?  
Putin:  We did our own investigation.  

Wolf:  You said you‚Äôd help Russia if you were reelected in 2012.  The economy has stalled while poverty has gone up.  
Putin:  Things got better and then levelled off.  Russia‚Äôs better off now than in the 1990s.  We‚Äôve got a lot of gold reserves.  

Wolf:  You‚Äôve been president since 2000.  You‚Äôre passing your term limit.  
Putin:  Technically my job title has changed.  

Wolf:  What about that Navalny guy?  
Putin:  [changes subject]  

Wolf:  You prevented him from running against you.  
Putin:  I‚Äôm not stopping anyone from seeing his website.   

Wolf:  What‚Äôs with the shirtless photos?  
Putin:  That‚Äôs how I roll when I‚Äôm on vacation.  

Wolf:  Say something in German.

Zelenskyy ran on a platform of cracking down on corruption, and won a landslide victory, which says to me that the Ukrainian people have a will for reform and Westernizing, but prior to this conflict he was generally seen as a weak leader. There was a lot of rhetoric in Ukraine back in 2021 criticizing him, ironically enough, for being too soft on Russia and oligarchs. Not to say that he had no successes, he was able to push through several reforms that he campaigned on, but a lot of people saw him as a celebrity in over his head.

Now, with the conflict having given him a new start to prove himself, the big question is will he be able to direct the influence and political good will he's earned into steering Ukraine toward proper modernization after this is over.

Also an odd digression into the possible motives for various assassinations of Putin opponents and predicting more to come.  (spoiler: the Satanic West trying to stir up trouble)

Transcript below:

Solovyov (Russian state TV host): *It very important for us to clearly understand we should not allow the enemy to cause internal divisions.  We are at war with Satanists.  They've erected this terrorist formation, which consumed the world,* ***beloved Ukraine***, *like a cancerous tumor, which took over the Ukrainian people and is tormenting them.  Of course, it was birthed by Washington. We remember this tradition.  They love to make some noise for Putin's birthday.  Yes, they love to do that. But later they don't want to mention the outcome of those investigations.  For example, the murder of Anya Politkovskaya****^(0)****, where the killers have been found.  Perhaps in the near future we can anticipate a high profile murder.* ***Americans are moral relativists.  They have a very blurred concept of right and wrong***.  *They are the Satan.*

Karnuakhov (Political Analyst):  *I purposely won't name any names right now on air.  During the last decade we had many very strange political events and murders.  Every time we wondered: what's the point of that?  The answer is simple: they were trying find the key and to unlock the door to actions of mass unrest and demonstrations.  In 2011 and 2013 they had some successes.  Thank God* ***we bashed them over the head*** *and we sealed that door shut.*

Sosnovsky (German blogger): *Still they keep trying.  I think that some of these murders which we have already forgotten we should nonetheless be reminded of.  Sergey didn't name names, but I will.  Skirpal****^(1)****, who I think is no longer alive.  The same goes for his daughter.  There is every reason to suppose they're gone.  Skirpal, Litvinenko****^(2)****, same issues with Berezovsky.  All of these people no longer had any influence, politically, in other processes or issues of importance.  In the public consciousness, their deaths immediately created certain waves.  Perhaps the most striking is the murder of Boris Yefimovich Nemtsov****^(3)****.  Yes, we've been remembering and discussing this today. To bring this operation to its logical conclusion, I'll be cynical and say* ***more murders will be needed***.  *I anticipate this will happen not in Russia, but in Europe.  I believe one of the opposition leaders will be killed.  And instead of the Yellow and Blue flag some kind of stamp or passport will be found leading to some sort of Petrov**^(4)* *or Boshirov****^(4)****.  And if will be said to be the revenge for Darya Dugina.  That's right.  It will be called the revenge for Dugina.  Perhaps Mr. Ponomarev, Milov, and Volkov should watch out.  Out of those three, if I was placing that order, Ponomarev is the most suitable figure.  In order to explain this to the whole world, it would seem very logical.*

Again things to remember  
Articles that even get to the front page of r/worldnews can and most likely will be clickbait without context or full appreciation of the quotes.  
Putin is not a ""mad man"" He acted on bad information + the weak response to 2014. Heck the guy even tried to annex the territories so he could find a legality to start conscription. Not he thought process of a mad man. A horrible man but not a ""mad man"" .  
Putin is fully aware of the reprocussions of a tactical nuke strike, both in terms of the US conventional response and losing China and India's support.  
Putin does not want to die and will do anything in his power to stay alive for as long as possible, even it it means making this a protracted conflict for years of shelling and what not. The man is sending thousands of troops to unsuccessfully be trained in Belarus and is sourcing winter coats and over 100,000 bullet proof vests from other countries. The OPEC behavior also seems like Putin wants to cause long term damage in the energy sector as well.  
He still has a lot of ways he can sell this narratively to the Russian people. He controls the media and allows the controlled opposition. It seems like they may be setting up Shoigu as the fall guy here.  
It's not a red button. And everyone involved in the process knows whats at stake with such behavior. And a lot of the people involved in the process are also those who would benefit from a changing of the guard aka ""coup"". Even if Putin wanted to Nuke from day 1 he probably hasn't because he knows such could immediately instigate a coup. People want to survive LOL. The russian elite are suffering but are still beyond wealthy. More than half of the russian country still supports the war and hates the west.  
As midterms come up, we are going to see more click bait articles. More fearmongering. More appeasement and calls to withdraw aid. Just a heads up.

I'd love to believe that an actual suicide drone did carry out a successful attack and took out 2 bombers (or maybe a Bayracktar took them out with missles?), but nothing in this article helps me believe it happened..    Maybe one of their own drones malfunctioned on takeoff and crashed on the runway, or even better, into the bombers? lol

We underestimate just in what terrible state the russian army was in back then.

What occupied and fought Ukraine in 2014, was a smaller group of professionals and motivated nationalists. They were in areas with close relations with Russia and they could use the disorganization and chaos to get outsized effect of a low number of troops.

From 2014 - 2022, Russia has increased funding of the army, the intelligence services and saved up a warchest. All in preperation for this offensive. This was their top notch army and economy meant to crush Ukraine. 

They underestimated the Ukrainian buildup and the western response, but there was no ''better time''.

I would like to compare it to a game of NS2(not the pipeline), as i'm a fan. In it a commander can do all the ''meta'' moves. While also correctly assessing his available resources, and having good intel of his opponents weakness. 

However, if he is not aware and taking into account, his teammates capabilites, he will overextend, lose resources and possibly lose against an inferior opposing team. (Not to mention arguing with his teammates about failing offensives and so on.)

With an understanding of his teammembers abilities, he would know the risks and costs associated with certain strategies, giving him an better chance for victory.

 >The 2019 Ukrainian presidential election was held on 31 March and 21 April in a two-round system. There were 39 candidates for the election on the ballot. The 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the occupation of parts of Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast prevented around 12% of eligible voters from participating in the election. As no candidate received an absolute majority of the vote, a second round was held between the top two candidates, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a comedian who portrayed a fictional president of Ukraine in the comedy television series Servant of the People, and the incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, on 21 April 2019.

There are none that reflect actual human ethnicities or migration patterns.  So there's no real call for them to reconcile these fantasies with each other.  

As always it's complicated by the defunct anthropological term 'Aryan', which referred not to people with white skin, but pre-Proto-Iranian speakers, and sometimes Proto-Indo-Iranian speakers.  In linguistics we just say 'Iranian' now, and anthropologists will be more specific than that with regards to things like archaeogenetics.  Regardless this term existed prior to and divorced from any notion of white supremacy, at least as it regards the specific peoples and cultures it refers to.  

But there are any number of reasons why the original Iranian peoples are not antecedent to Europeans, much less light-skinned people.  Iranian is a sub-branch of the Indo-European family of languages, which has many other branches, which ultimately originated in modern day Ukraine/Russia (according to most research; let's ignore the Anatolian camp for the moment because they're fucked in the head), and which is itself but one of many language families in use at the time whose contemporaries had speakers of light skin.  

Neither Germans nor Russians come from Iranian/Aryan tribes, they are sisters/cousins of the same family - although linguistically Balto-Slavic is closest and we think branched off soon after Indo-Iranian did.  

It completely ignores the indigenous peoples of Europe, hunter-gatherers representing an untold number of language families only one of which survives today (Basque).  

It completely ignores the variation in skin tone at the time (pre-Pict Britain most likely looked [like this](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42939192)).  

It ignores contemporary 'white' peoples such as Uralic, Samoyedic, Semitic, and others.  

Moreover we now know whiteness, which also occurs natively in Africa, is a bigger part of the color wheel than thought; it's part of a gradient.  Very fair skin requires three specific mutations coming together at the same time, which may have happened first in Scandinavia, and only because of migrations of peoples coming up from the Mid-East bringing one of the genes and another routing through Spain.  This shade is also a very recent development, genetically speaking.  Compare this to very dark skin, which is the result of the suppression of a single gene, and is even more recent.  

So any attempt - *any* attempt to map the migrational history or modern expression of these genes onto specific peoples, let alone specific regions, is operating in contradiction not only of scientific evidence, but of how genetics even works.",1665189559.0,1665189222.0,t3_xxp21a,t1_irgqbwt,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

If everyone is adamant, like many vocal Ukrainian supporters online, that this ends with Russia losing nuclear weapons, paying reparations, and Putin tried for war crimes, then Putin doesn't give up. He keeps doing what he's doing because he's not letting his country be permanently de-fanged and him going to jail. 

And Ukraine can't brute force their way to victory. No matter how impressive Ukraine is, they aren't conquering their way to Moscow and forcing unconditional surrender. They don't have the resources, and the support that is keeping them in the fight will disappear if they start trying to seriously move into Russia. The blue and gold aren't going to fly over red square, sorry guys.

And after Ukraine brutally learned the difference between being a NATO Estonia and non-NATO Ukraine, I assume there will be a huge push to join, although the question is whether it can be negotiated (Crimea and Russian demilitarization of its western border for Neutrality?)...which is hard when so few people are willing to listen to the other side right now.

 He also has a little bit of hope left of winning the entire thing. The biggest thing all Russians are raised on are their victory in WW2. Victory - that came after complete ruin in 1941 where they were suffering humongous defeats over and over. Like way worse than anything Ukraine done to them in this war.

Then survive until someone Isolationist gets elected in the USA again. And then finally - grind through Ukraine without western support.

Compare it to the wars in Chechnya in the 90's/00's. The capital, Grozny, was completely leveled. A wasteland indeed. Thousands of dead civilians and soldiers alike, unspeakable atrocities were commited.  
This happened mainly due to the Kremlin's (very real) fear that if they would let Chechnya declare independence from Russia, other regions in the federation would soon follow suite and start a domino effect which would have meant the end of modern Russia.  
Now a similar scenario is playing out. This time (since 2013, that is) it's not Chechnya seeking independence but Ukraine seeking closer ties with 'the West', after having kicked out their putinist president Yanukovych.  
The Kremlin will not allow it since they know it will make them look weak and give other ex-USSR states the iniative to try something similar. Ukraine is too big to be ignored, and if countries like Belarus and Kazakhstan would turn their back on Russia it would be a disaster.

At the opening of the invasion there were three-fold benefits:

\- The main motivation for the 2014 -invasion was to remove a democratic, independent Ukraine as a competitor in the energy-market. Ukraine has untapped oilfields and natural gas, that could provide a competing source for Europe, thus weakening the Russian government's most lucrative revenues-stream. 

\- In addition to threatening the foundation of the Russian political system (cronyist oligarchy with power split between business-interests and politicians, rather than institutions) losing political control over Ukraine is incompatible with the Russian political-ideology. The national ethos that has arisen in the last decade, has been increasingly nationalistic, insular and hostile, to the point of fascism. Bringing Ukraine back into Russia's influence through regime-change is seen as a generally righteous and justified political goal, and a natural expression of Russian supremacy. This is what all 'the saving the west from degenerate homosexuals'-nonsense fits into. They don't care what happens to Ukraine when they take it, because being punished for defying Russia is seen as desireable for the entire population.

\- Lastly, is of course the aim of changing Russia's geopolitical position and it's geopolitical standing. Russia wanted to not only make it easier on itself to exert direct influence in the Black Sea and the balkans far into the future, it wanted more buffer-states between itself and Nato-countries, as Russian military-thinking considers a Nato-attack on it's country a very likely scenario some time in the future. That is why even a strong, neutral Ukraine at it's border is a threat, as all it registers as is a potential avenue of attack at it's border (and one that Russia can't negotiate with because of the above political reasons)

\- Why they attacked now has to do with the economic strain that propping up the seperatist-regions and Crimea has had, and the global enrgy-crisis that was already present at the start of the conflict. Putin did not want to wait any longer to execute an invasion he though he had to do anyway, and the high price of energy, and the current european dependence on Russian gas and oil, made this the time where Putin thought he could bully Europe into accepting the invasion without severe political consequences.

One of Russia's overarching goals throughout its existence has been to acquire a warm water port that will give it unobstructed access to the rest of the world.  When Russia annexed Crimea, it got a warm water port, but it's entire Crimean fleet can be easily blocked by Turkey at both the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits.  This is a major reason why Ergodan has been playing such a large role in current talks between Russia and Ukraine.

I believe Putin's goal was to retake Ukraine in a 3 day blitz operation, which would show Russia's strength and ability.  If this had been successful, Putin probably believed that Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria would have agreed to give Russia resume their roles as Russian satellite states.

Russia already had a defense agreement with Armenia in place, which borders Turkey.

With the ability to mount offensive operations at both ends, Putin would likely have attempted to create tensions between Armenia and Turkey that could have given him the excuse to invade.

If Putin could establish a puppet regime in Turkey, he could have his warm water port and access to much more trade as well as an unfettered navy.

EDIT:  I didn't expect this post to quite so controversial.  To be clear for the many, many people who don't seem to grasp it, I do not believe the plan I laid out above would be successful.  I believe that Putin thought it would be successful based on his previous experiences of watching the West back down from confrontation and what he believed was a stranglehold on Western Europe's gas and oil supplies.

There will be two major factors that bring about the end of the war next spring.

The first is economic .  A combination of men leaving to avoid the draft, men being drafted, and the sanctions will cause a more significant collapse of the Russian economy then expected.  The lose of manpower will hurt the poor rural areas just as much as the brain drain and sanctions will hurt the cities.  The Russian government will not be able to adapt as they have so far because of compounding layers of problems.  Sanctions are bad, sanctions and a depleted local workforce are catastrophic.

The second factor is General Winter.  Russia will be unable to support the mobilized forces during the winter.  (They will attempt to compensate by attacking Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.)  Untrained, poorly led, hungry and freezing Russian troops will not be willing to fight in the spring, if they live.

It's why Biden talking so tough isn't necessarily a bad thing.

***The use of nukes is highly unlikely*** but what is the most likely condition IF Russia was going to do it?

Probably some last ditch effort to stall a Ukrainian advance in Crimea.

Regardless of the so called 'separatist' regions, Crimea is likely the most important territory Russia has taken.

If Ukraine was in a position where it was advancing in Crimea, it's likely all other regions have been liberated so the risks to the war effort for Russia are reduced.

But it's still a really dumb move with a lot of repercussions for Russia and very little to gain even in this scenario.

 1. Lack of NBC gear for his troops. So anything he tries to take with WMDs, his unprepared troops might not be able to keep, what with all the dying from fallout and such.

 2. All indications are that China and India really, *really* wouldn't like it. They might even choose to cut Putz loose.

 3. Western response. One retired US admiral predicted that if Putz did use a tactical nuke, NATO would likely take out what's left of the Black Sea Fleet.

 4. Western response, part 2 - it might even cause a full-out nuclear war. Which it's clear Putin would very thoroughly lose.

 4a. Any nuclear conflict would result in Putin losing - at minimum - Moscow. Which is the essential center of all Russian culture. If that happens, the very idea of Russia might very well go with it. That's probably a big deal to him.

Of course that is her name, but has it occurred to you that of course this is not the first time a name has needed to be transliterated from one alphabet to another? Do you make the same complaint with –í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –û–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ó–µ–ª–µ–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π? Whose name, by the way, I had to cut and paste from elsewhere? Or perhaps can I just call him Zelenskyy without being harangued? 

When transliterating it is common to adopt a phonetic lettering that matches the original sound as best as possible. The letter ""J"" does not have that sound in English, I think ever. It's not disrespectful to try and get the sounds close. Since the letters will be by necessity require changes anyway, why not try and get the sounds right? 

And by the way the spelling ""Zelenskyy"" is not universal as it makes various poetic tradeoffs to arrive at those letters. There are other variants out there.

Transliteration is not arrogance, but in fact a *more* respectful approach to the original sounds of the words. As an English speaker I have, for instance, no idea how to pronounce a ""C"" with an inverted circumflex. Not a clue. Would you prefer I just made something up and more-than-likely butcher it? Or perhaps you could come to my house and criticize me for that too? And maybe then I could make fun of your accent in return, and this is how conflict begins.

They are worn by the Internal Troops of the Interior Ministry in the Soviet Union and its successor state Russia. These helmets continue to be used today by the police and special purpose troops. As early as 1984, the Soviet secret service KGB had titanium helmets developed at military research facilities, which were further used and further developed by the FSB and special forces of the military after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

You see it on Reddit all the time people panicking about a possible nuclear war and this can potentially filter up through elected governments. That might elect people who are less willing to oppose Russia, thus support Ukraine less, maybe push Ukraine for a cease fire which would freeze Russia's gains. 

Putin is a dictator, might be a sociopath (as many dictators are, which explains their ruthlessness), and is more akin to a Mexican drug cartel leader in a lot of ways. Has some money due to oil, some power due to a larger army than many, is completely corrupt from top to bottom. He uses money and extreme violence the same way cartels do. 

He also is not as smart as a lot of the west gives him credit for. I would gather he is really not that bright to be honest. He had no idea of his own army's capabilities, had no self realization that developing institutionalized corruption through the government might, just might, negatively affect the military.

Like for reference, pure anecdote, I was pretty aware of the situation and kept up with politics and the defense industry side, and virtually all of my predictions ended up being spot-on right.  *Keep in mind I am a nobody on Reddit,* but the only ones I was wrong was:

\-I thought Russia would ""break its back"" in taking/attempting to take Kyiv proper instead of faltering before it

\-I expected a bit more mechanized massed tank ops like we're starting to see in Kherson, more like in summer from Ukraine, with correspondingly higher casualties; that's more strategy and tactics and priorities though

\-expected Russia to sue for peace by late fall, and Ukrainian casualties to be higher

\-sanctions bit harder than expected, Russia's political structure is also dumber than expected.  I thought they'd avert war because if I, a rando on the internet, could see it was full-on dick-in-a-blender stupid, surely so could people with entire redundant intelligence apparatuses having done just the tip for eight years.

It's hard to take someone serious who made it their job to predict one nation, made it out to be a huge threat, only for that threat to basically shatter on impact; the **real** Russian army that rolled out in Feb is dead and gone and has been since May.

edit: corruption was known about of course, but, like, legit, the impression it was badly a tip-of-the-spear-only thing was underappreciated by professionals, and somehow people forgot that Ukraine of 2022 is wildly different from Ukraine of 2014.

The one I saw was a few months back (maybe even before withdrawal from Kyiv area) and was absolutely disgusting. There were 3-4 Russian soldiers with hands tied behind their backs laying in the road. One was already shot and had a large pool of blood and was gurgling and crying. The others were crying and the soldier walked up and shot one several times in the back, killing him slowly.

People on here need to stop pretending all Ukrainian soldiers are selfless heroes. I am not defending Russia or attacking Ukraine. They have every right to defend themselves from the Russian invaders and I support them fully. War is disgusting and makes monsters of everyone.

So, the total market doesn't go from $50B to $25B each (again oversimplifying). But: the $50B goes to (say) $30B due to price competition. So each market participant gets $15 B. That would crash the Russian economy going from $50B --->$15 B.

 >The Winter War, also known as the First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. The war began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.
 
**[Cold-weather warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold-weather_warfare)** 
 
 >Cold-weather warfare, also known as arctic warfare or winter warfare, encompasses military operations affected by snow, ice, thawing conditions or cold, both on land and at sea. Cold-weather conditions occur year-round at high elevation or at high latitudes, and elsewhere materialise seasonally during the winter period. Mountain warfare often takes place in cold weather or on terrain that is affected by ice and snow, such as the Alps and the Himalayas. Historically, most such operations have been during winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

If people want to stop this they will have to be smarter and critically sort out facts from their own bias.  This is hard for people who are not brought up learning these life skills. 

Trump is a perfect example of how someone can make totally false claims and morons accept them while pushing based on their own desires and internal biases.


**appeal to authority**

You said that because an authority thinks something, it must therefore be true.

It's important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of experts, or scientific consensus. Appeals to authority are not valid arguments, but nor is it reasonable to disregard the claims of experts who have a demonstrated depth of knowledge unless one has a similar level of understanding and/or access to empirical evidence. However, it is entirely possible that the opinion of a person or institution of authority is wrong; therefore the authority that such a person or institution holds does not have any intrinsic bearing upon whether their claims are true or not.

>If you cannot acknowledge this rather obvious reality you are straight up a fucking russian agent. I don't give a fuck how offended you might act at the idea.

When people call other people Russian agents because they can't do the basic labor of stomaching an inconvenient complexity about a war, all it does is degrade the exchange of information and make people more prone to confusion, panic and Russian propaganda. The ultimate aim of Russian propaganda is not to trick people into the wrong beliefs; it is to disable people and cause them to disengage because figuring out the truth is just too hard.
