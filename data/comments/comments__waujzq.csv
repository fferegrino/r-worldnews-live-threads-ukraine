Day 156 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had yet another missile strike, this time at 4:10am, they fired 9 missiles, people said that 2 of them malfunctioned and fell in Russia. Of the ones that did work, half hit Kharkiv and the other half landed in oblast. Those are definitely S-300 missiles; they wouldn’t waste 9 Iskanders at this point of the war.

Not a single military target was hit as always, this time they hit a 2-story residential building, yet another university, and a meat processing plant. I really don’t understand why are they wasting their missiles on something that will not help them win this war in any way, are their commanders really that stupid? 

In Kharkiv they haven’t hit a single ammo depot of ours since the start of the war, literally not a single one, I was here since day 1, and I haven’t seen or heard secondary explosions even once. Either we don’t have any ammo dumps in the city, or they are just incredibly well hidden. Or it could be that Russian intelligence service is just that inept at their job, after all they have been hitting “military targets” that existed 11 years ago here in Kharkiv, but don’t exist in the present.

And now right after they release the video of torture and execution of a Ukrainian POW, they can’t blame Ukraine for it, so they only way to change the subject somehow. So they do something even more outrageous, and suddenly on the next day 50 more POWs get killed in a “HIMARS strike by Ukrainian forces” conveniently not a single Russian was killed in that “Ukrainian HIMARS strike”.

They also “interviewed” the surviving POWs, and made them say that it was a HIMARS strike, even though they wouldn’t know what a HIMARS strike would look like, they became POWs before we got the HIMARS. Do Russians think that they will be able to do whatever atrocities they want in our country and then go back to their country with no consequences?

🪖 On Thursday, Kyiv was shelled by up to [25 cruise missiles from Belarus](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1552552921199480833).  

🍄 Holiday or not, there were some explosions to report in [Ilovaisk](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552826408023592960.html) Donetsk, an unspecified spot [near the Dnipro](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1552773841373495296),  [Donetsk](https://twitter.com/KyleJGlen/status/1552613515416018946), the [Nova Kakhovka](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552797383607701505.html) area Kherson, an [ammo dump](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1552743244659818497) near Kherson, and the good ol’ [Kherson Airport](https://twitter.com/GirkinGirkin/status/1552634740129382401).  

🚧  In the battle of Kherson, Ukraine waits to see if russia will make a “goodwill gesture” and retreat -- sparing the lives of countless civilians.  Representatives of the United russia Party reportedly [left Kherson](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1552764626957471745).  An exodus of russian civilians, military families (moved in [earlier in the war](https://twitter.com/MyroslavaHladch/status/1540355212665315331)), and collaborators are expected to be a precursor to a russian “goodwill gesture”.  So far, there is only this isolated report.  In a late development, it’s reported the russians have [stolen a passenger ship](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552823150668382214) and are using it to ferry men and supplies across the river.

👉 A live-streamed video of a Ukrainian POW being [tortured by castration](https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1552782819327414277) (yahoo link, SFW) made its rounds on social media on Thursday.  The criminal responsible for the war-crime appears to have been identified.  The reaction of [pro-russian sources](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1552787357291659265) is at best, inhuman.  It's sad to note that this is just one single story in a very, very, very [long book](https://twitter.com/IlvesToomas/status/1552535278073552897).

👉 In other russian warcrime news, russia attacked Avdiivka and Pisky in the Donbas area [wearing Ukrainian uniforms](https://twitter.com/prm_ua/status/1552700939261411331).

👨🏻‍💻 Ukraine asked Meta (aka Facebook) to [improve its moderation](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1552734957147144192) of Ukrainian content to avoid deleting and blocking Ukrainian bloggers on the social network.

 👉 The US Senate on Thursday **unanimously** approved a resolution calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate [russia a state sponsor of terrorism](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552637991323111425).  There are some sanctions and penalties on countries that do business with russia if this designation is assigned.

👉 Oryx has [visually documented](https://twitter.com/Rebel44CZ/status/1552753984712151041) 900 russian tank losses, and 100 UAV drone losses.  Additionally Forbes reports on [300 artillery pieces destroyed](https://twitter.com/Forbes/status/1552305334752055307) and its impact.

🇩🇪  In a somewhat [high-profile announcement](https://twitter.com/nukestrat/status/1552763497557155841), the US has approved the sale of 35 F-35As and 75 JASSM-ER/XR to Germany.   The F-35s will replace Tornados in nuclear strike missions.  This doesn’t affect the war in Ukraine, but is a part of the larger cold-war occurring between russia and the West.

🇮🇱  Germany’s Kompromat was gas.  Israel’s is Jewish people.  Despite Israel refusing to provide military aid to Ukraine, the russian government wants to [close down Sokhnut](https://twitter.com/juliaioffe/status/1552451481361870848), an organization that helps Jews to emigrate to Israel, charging it with “brain drain”.

This is rarely talked about due to lack of information, but from what one can put together, Russia's ""filtration camps"" are in fact politicide camps - on occupied territories they are hunting and executing Ukrainians who are loyal to Ukraine.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 29 July 2022
 
- Since March, Russian private military company (PMC) Wagner Group has operated in eastern Ukraine in coordination with the Russian military. Wagner has likely been allocated responsibility for specific sectors of the front line, in a similar manner to normal army units.

- This is a significant change from the previous employment of the group since 2015, when it typically undertook missions distinct from overt, large-scale regular Russian military activity.

- This new level of integration further undermines the Russian authorities' long-standing policy of denying links between PMCs and the Russian state. Wagner's role has probably changed because the Russian MoD has a major shortage of combat infantry, however Wagner forces are highly unlikely to be sufficient to make a significant difference in the trajectory of the war.

As well as poles, latvians, geogians etc. That's because we know that it's not the first time russia does these things. Russia has been committing massacres, rapes, tortures, genocide for ages but people have short memory + russia hasn't been punished for any of that ever + it was known as the country who defeated nazism, a hero + not much of these things were taught in schools of US and many European countries as well. 



And this is a huge problem because it leads to such narratives as ""putin's war"", ""good russians"", ""poor russian soldiers who were forcible sent to this war"", ""it's all because of putin's propaganda"", ""those who celebrate war crimes in the internet are just bots"", ""this monster who cut off genitalias of ukrainian POW is just one madman"", ""when putin dies, everyting will be ok"" etc. I see the nowedays world's reaction, that step by step people start to understand that all this is bullshit, but not everyone. 



The history repeats itself, each russian leader looked more progressive than the previous one at first but each of them did all these shocking things after all, murdered people, committed genocide etc. And russians are used to such government, they are ok to masochism and sadism. Russia was nothing better and sometimes worse than Germany during WW2. 



If the world really knew the history, it would act faster, it wouldn't be surprised, it would be ready.



I highly recommend you to read these instagram posts + the book called ""War and Myth. Unknown WW2"". This book is quite simple and it's very eye-opening and it would help you to be aware of what russians are capable of and what's coming next.

In particular, these junior officers will lack formal officer education and will learn things as they go which may get people killed.

To the people how (totally rightfull) answered me, this sentence does not respect humanity, it is not a good way to react to the situation, there are for sure Russians that would do nothing in that direction, to stay human, you must diffenrenciate between this russians and the other. YES, YOU ARE RIGHT! But I feel so overwhelmed now.

When I was 10 years old, my father raped my one year younger sister, my mother standig by, praying loud to god, that this should be ended. But no word to him.

Both where very religious, part of a protestantic sect, both thaught of themselves as better human beings; the reason why I am not religious at all.

I think that everyone is responsible for his / their doings and not doings - there not god, no religion, no ideology, to give you an order what to do and what not.

Ofc I know what war is like, I grew up with B52s bombarding Vietnam, I've seen Palestinesian and Israel atrocities, and many many more. More then enough to get a picture.

But this one is not only geographical very near, it is so well documented, that it penetrates my soul more then ever before.

I try to stay human, I don't want to become like them, I want to good russians be part of my life but this is hard.

I play chess at the lichess site. There are four persons from Russia I used to play with. All of them between 35 and 55 years old.

From Sotchi and Moskau.

Studied persons, software developer, teacher, tourist planner. Three of them told me, Ukraine provoked Russia with it politics, so the war could not be avoided.

I know that section is exposed from Russian territory so maybe it's more of a concentration of firepower to stall those units, idk.  



Just working theories of mine. IMO the weakest link of Russias army is their organizational command structure. If you attack all fronts and work up the control centers into a frenzy, you might just help create a trickle down effect of chaos with the frontline and speed this whole thing up. Make the different regional commanders compete for available reinforcements. If you can get any one if those fronts in a retreat, I think it would be worth it.

This reason:
This video is likely weeks or months old. There are likely hundreds or even thousands of similar (or even worse) videos. Assume most of them don't get released, but most of them do get intercepted by intelligence agencies. Particularly the GRU.

So why was this one video released NOW?

>I’m not sure what the Russian on-line operations game is exactly.

First and foremost, they want to divide the allies from Ukraine. So of course, the release of this video (and stoking of divisive sentiment online), is going to encourage individual Ukrainians to feel validated in their rage. And some of them will act. No matter what Zelenskyy and his command structure say.  It's stochastic at this point. 

Compliant newsmedia could take ONE event, and blow it up and make it look like a systematic and cultural problem (as has happened in the case of the Russian pow abuse).

And when that happens, expect Russia to bitch and cry loudly that ""Ukrainians are nazis. See? look at their war crimes!"" - and maybe, just maybe, some more EU allies will peel off and ""nope"" Ukraine's ascension. 

I think that's what they're trying to do.

They're probably also aware that a few thousand Russian troops near Kherson are likely about to be encircled, and they want those guys to fight to the death, rather than surrender, and take their chances that the Ukrainians won't get a little payback.

Some of your other ideas are also pretty good guesses. 

I just don't see any hope in trying to stop them from spreading this. At this point, I feel like all I can do is to just sit by, watch, and hope that Ukraine keeps a lid on any ""revenge"" acts. Any of the rest that could happen, is just going to happen.  These guys have pretty much taken over huge swaths of social media with their crap, and they're very good at manipulating global public sentiment.

(R1)=Russian man (R2)=Russian man 2

(R1): Hello. We have very bad news. Have you heard already?

(R2): Umm... now the news emerged that something arrived at you at
Yelenovka.

(R1): This is all bullsh*t. They themselves hit the barracks. It had 200
people. Basically, two days ago they were resettled from the
barracks, from the three barracks. The total number was up to 200
people. 190 and something. They were resettled for some reason to
the industrial area, they made some sort of barracks there, boasting
that everything will be taken out of here, and only ""Azov"" will remain
there. Like, until the next wave *of prisoners* comes... So... Yesterday
at night around 11pm the ""Grad"" started working... right under the
fence... Well, around 100 meters from the fence, it was visible. 10
missiles at a time. The first 10 resulted in an explosion. The next 10
also explosion. Third - explosion, so three explosions in total. The
windows were not blown out anywhere, there was no characteristic
arrival of a shell, no whistle. So there were only explosions. Right. A
lot - ""200"",""300"" [dead and wounded]. We don't know the exact
number. Anyway, it's all been set up, on purpose, you understand?
Most likely there are survivors. Well, as I said, there are some medics
from the hospital who were with us... they went there too.... Anyway,
they said - ""Guys, you are being killed"". You see? And also, there were
three shots from the assault rifle. After all of this, the fire started... So
yeah...

(R2): F*ck.

(R1): The fact that they set it all up themselves, the probability is very
high, there were no arrivals. Like, first of all, if looking... *unintelligible*
...it was after some time, not exactly when the ""Grad"" fired... to fire
somewhere where people were resettled two days ago, right?

(R2): So they shelled the barracks with ""Grad""s specifically?

(R1): No, the most likely have put this inside, there were no arrivals.
I'm telling you.
-
(R2): The connection is poor, I cannot hear everything.

(R1): I see. They most likely set up an explosive device in advance...

Just like in so many other ways Russia has seemingly overplayed it's hand in the information war as well. Before the war they got used to be able to advance false narratives because often no one in a position of authority in other countries would loudly call them out on their bullshit. Another favorite was to put out multiple stories about the same event to try and obfuscate what really happened, then let that confusion cover their tracks. Those strategies don't seem to be working anymore.

Others often announcing their actions ahead of time, notably the invasion in February, and Russia trying to deny they would invade Ukraine and then of course going and doing it anyway has undermined their own propaganda strategies, at least in the rest of the world if not within Russia itself. Their string of documented war crimes in Ukraine have only cemented the image that they are monsters that can not be trusted.

Yes there are still Russian shills in every country and yes there are many brainwashed people in Russia itself but I feel like the rest of the world has turned a corner and are finally seeing the Russian government for what it is, a lying genocidal regime that invades its neighbors and doesn't give a shit about anything or anyone except its own survival. Hopefully that fact stays in peoples minds that are currently undergoing economic hardship, I'm starting to notice a squeeze on my finances, but everyone needs to remember as [the secretary general of NATO said](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/w1f9p9/nato_secretary_general_jens_stoltenberg_on/) you need to pay the price now because ""the alternative is to pay a much higher price later on.""

1. The Russian army structure is now very different from the US and Western structures, in that it depends on commissioned officers and a completely top-down approach to strategy. So you are correct that this is devastating to Russia.
2. by reports, Ukraine has since 2014 largely (perhaps not completely) transitioned to a Western/US structure where the non-comm structure and--crucially--the ability to support lower level initiative is prized.  To what degree this is true remains a question but the success of Ukraine since February versus Russia is hardly at issue (with Western arms, but the ability to successfully integrate new arms in Ukraine's defense and counter-attacks so far is impressive). Can they use this structure to conduct large-scale offensive initiatives?--I don't know.
3. Now, Ukraine's losses to its command structure that are inevitable given its war losses obviously poses, as you seem to suggest, a challenge to the Ukraine command structure,

But do you think it is Ukraine or russia that has demonstrated the ability to meet the challenge of new non-commissioned officers (or Russian officers) a) in a force that remains strictly top down or b) to a relatively new military in Ukraine who as shifted at least a partial non-comm structure since 2014? Russia may continue to prevail through sheer force of artillery pounding, but I think the last 2 weeks have marked the end of that strategy for russia, save in areas in the Donbas, where they have clear superiority (Eastern Donbass). Elsewhere, the tide, I think, has turned.  We will see what happens in the next two months in Kherson and elsewhere.

It is true longterm  that by sheer depletion of officer corp Russia may be forced, reluctantly, to change its command structure.  How long do you think that will take in a country run by Putin?",1659076379.0,1659076152.0,t3_waujzq,t1_ii3ezlg,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

If they bag him and tag him and have him sent to Kyiv, where he is jailed until tried, that would be a display of values Ukraine is fighting for. Now, if he somehow dies in prison from bad conscience, noone will shed much tear for the animal, but there should be civil procedure.

I am just saying nothing is gained by, I don't know, doing the same to him that he did to the Ukrainian POW. Even the shot POW won't get his former life back.

With the evidence of the crap that we do to each other so easily available, and literally available within minutes of when it occurs, it's harder and harder to ignore.   When allowed to, humanity is often behaving a lot less kindly, and ever more cruelly when permitted to.   It's utterly gloomy, and depressing.

And what makes it worse is the powerlessness we might feel, given how far removed from the situation we are.   Barring lobbying our political representatives, and our government on a whole, and donating some money to a hopefully worthy cause, our ability to influence what goes on is limited.

So - what can you control, for certain, and without doubt?  **Yourself.**  You can control what you do for others, when you do things for others, and how often you do things for others.   **Good things.**  Sure, we may not be able to give scads of money and time to help others.   But sometimes, it's as simple as offering a hand to someone with their groceries when they're trying to manage purse, groceries and 2 petulant kids.   Or if someone's digging around, desperately trying to find money to fill up their car for a trip to the doctor or visiting a sick friend.   Or you know that elderly neighbor next door hasn't been out much, and might need someone to check on them.  Helping them means at least one person is better off because you stepped in and helped.  **You can do the good thing.**

There's a line in the Bible in James 2 that says, to paraphrase, ""Faith without good works is dead.""   That is to say, it's not enough to believe, and to tell everyone about your belief, but that without good works behind it (done by the people sharing their belief, I would note), the faith is empty.   Just the same, without you doing good work and seeing how it helped someone, your own faith can die as well.

Do good, friend.

Meanwhile they've seemingly given up trying to advance from Izyum towards Slovyansk at all, they've spent 2 months trying to progress there and made almost zero progress in taking the actual city.

In addition many reports are also that they are using sections of a pontoon bridge pulled by boats to transfer heavy equipment accross Dnieper near Kherson, without a picture it's hard to know which reports are correct. I believe these reports are also getting confused with reports of pontoon bridges the Russians have set up across the Inhulets river. Fog of war makes it hard to say with certainty.

And yes I am sure 20,000 more poorly trained troops will make a huge difference in taking more medium size cities that get them barely closer to their much reduced goals that went from overthrowing the Ukranian government to taking the rest of the Donbass while trying not to lose their land bridge to Crimea.

Jesus fuck.  The Holocaust alone killed 6 - 7 million Jews, plus another 6 - 15 million non-jews (Soviets, Poles, other Slavs, Romas, gay people, political dissidents, other ethnic and religious minorities, etc) were killed in either the Holocaust, other extermination programs, or mass-murders along the front-lines.  Those numbers represent **only** the civilians killed in deliberate Nazi mass-murders.

You're also ignoring the fact that Hitler initiated the Second World War in Europe and North Africa, which has an estimated death toll of about 40+ million people (usually including the number of people killed by Nazi extermination programs).  Was everybody in WWII killed by the Nazis?  No, but given that the Nazis and their allies were the aggressors in that campaign, it's reasonable to place the blame for those ~~60~~ 40 million on them - just as one can place the blame for the current invasion's deaths on Putin.  Hell, roughly 20 million Soviets were killed in WWII - the vast majority of them were the fault of the Nazis.

China's endeavors in Africa have been major points of failure so far. China, as always, doesn't understand the cultures, and  its methods aren't that fruitful, even though they pour a shit ton of money in search for dominance.

Ruzzia is only relevant because they supply a lot of weapons to Africa, but how long and far that is going to go is debatable.

On the other hand, the EU just signed a gas pipeline agreement with Nigeria, Niger, and Algeria. And more is going to follow.

Unlike China, for example, that goes in and demands resources and everything they can get their hands on for building some crappy infrastructure, the new pipeline will be a net profit for these three countries, considering the EU is going to pay for most of it anyway.

So with the EU they get to sell their resources at a huge profit margin, with China they end up losing significant resources. Which one do you think they are going to prefer? And then, if the EU/US move in with these sort of projects, they can simply push Ruzzia out, because the EU can say ""no ruzzian weapons, please"" as a condition.",False,1659125846.0,t3_waujzq,t1_ii5v4vc,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

They didn't video the act, but they videoed the aftermath. It was published on liveleak, and of course the opposition were so incensed they rioted, government forces machinegunned them, and before you knew it, they had a civil war. Which didn't really work out very well for the vast majority of Syrians.

But since the Assad regime has had close co-operation with Russia since probably the 1950's, this is a provocation measure (called ""provokatsiya"" in Russian) - it's basically straight out of the Russian/FSB/NKVD/Checka playbook.

So we can sit here and judge them for having barbarians in their ranks. But it's so much worse than that. This entire incident including the release of the video, was timed and coordinated, and likely planned, to achieve a specific response.

If you think about the high-up Russian intelligence officials in air-conditioned offices wearing suits and drafting plans on chalkboards, and how they casually executed this as part of their war effort - you can see that it's far, far worse than a simple single incident of barbarism.

(in fact - there are likely thousands or tens of thousands of such atrocities that have happened since February; but honestly probably since 2014, many of them were probably videoed, and Russian intelligence probably intercepts and catalogs these, and releases them when it's convenient for their plans).

What does Russia have to gain by this?

    Inflict Terror on their enemies.
    Provoke Ukrainians to mistreat their POW's in revenge, thus Russia could level accusations of 'war-crimes' against the Ukrainian regime, and divide EU allies.

That's partially why they had achieved so much during USSR, where people were told what to produce, how and when, before the implosion mass built up. This mindset still is very much prevalent, as we all have learned and are learning. Putin is trying to come up with a model for new USSR that won't implode, he's tweaking controls and watches how far he can take it without it breaking.

Russian military is fundamentally a reflection of the same thing, and transitioning from their current hierarchy and organization to something more resembling NATO's more independent and initiative-rewarding structure, is, in my humble opinion, not going to happen as it directly contradicts how Russia wants to do things. Their power _is_ wielded by controlling the relatively uneducated masses farther from Moscow towards the east. Russia has never directly tackled that problem in any ""democratic"" fashion, their tools are the whip while the carrot is in short supply. Expecting them to reform their military like that is unrealistic, it doesn't pivot that way simply. They have problems with dedovschina (veterans systematically threatening/raping/beating new conscripts) and if you just decentralize and give initiative, it's going to turn the corps into incohesive unstable units that's even worse than what Russia can use today.

In short, it will take societal reforms before their military can be re-formed, the latter is just a reflection of the former.

At the same time it was very different because of the way the information and news were accessed.

And I don't mean it in a downplayed way.  
Right now, if you want to find what's going on in ukraine, you go on internet, find a preferred site and dive through tons upon tons of information. Not just general but specific, you can find out which cities and villages are under whose control and where the shelling is happening. You can look at a map and find the specific village where somebody died (well, assuming you do find the correct one in the correct region under that name...). In some cases you can look at 3D photos from those places.   
Yet at the same time, you know you cannot fully trust all sources. We now know that information and truth is a weapon in itself. PR has a value. It is being used.

Now go back a hundred years. Imagine you are living in region that is peaceful. How do you know what's happening?   
You either buy newspapers and find days to weeks old information written by an author you pick out of five to six options. All of these authors are likely controlled by your local government and they cannot freely publish anything they want.   
You are getting very distilled general information and some specific stories about a specific unit or two. Your understanding of the war is very different to what is actually happening. 

The question is, did people know this? Did they understand that they are getting controlled information that has a big chance of not being true? That they are only vaguely understanding what's going on?

And if the Ukrainians are doing it correctly, I'm imagining that those forward depots are moving every night, just to be even more safe.

Working at night also reduces the number and kinds of assets that can operate to hit the HIMARS, such as enemy aircraft and helicopters that might be deployed deep behind Ukrainian front lines that might be loitering in the areas.   Firing once and moving back also reduces the ability to use counter-battery radar to guide available units towards the likely area of launch.",False,1659096979.0,t3_waujzq,t1_ii3egjg,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

Russians have ammunition. Quite a bit of that is already in Sevastopol.  They have extensive fortification dating to pre-WW2 and they added to that throughout the cold war.  The trenches and bunker networks in eastern Ukraine today look remarkably similar to WW1 trenches.  The Azovstol plant in Mariupol demonstrated Soviet civil defense construction.  Sevastopol's primary economy is the Russian (formerly Soviet) Navy.  No need to think western engineers could not make a better fortification.

It mainly has to do with the fact that realistically all Ukraine has to do to ""win"" in the end is not lose while the Russians have to actually ""win"" in order to have the closure to this conflict that they seek.

Russian gains continue to be measured in smaller and smaller amounts of land and at some point they will no longer be able to go forwards. They have committed huge amounts of their standing army to this war, the offensive capability of which has degraded severely within the past five months to the point where they are now forming ""volunteer battalions"" of overpaid conscripts to make up the difference.

Mauras believed the Monarchy was the stabilizing force of society, and that the church needed to lend its force as support. Mussolini realized that the only way the ruling elite would be beaten was if the Italian people were able to consider themselves that new elite, and their nationalism and identity could be used to power their takeover.

A lot of people who have told me that they support trans people, and then failed to follow through or turned out to be lying when I was trans in a way that wasn't polished for public consumption.

Infinite growth isn't possible not because of physical laws, but because of much more mundane reasons. Capitalism has shown the results it has because it relies on human greed existing to maintain function. Human greed is consistent, therefore capitalism has persisted. Methods of distribution running on non profit oriented systems have failed because of extreme centralization, coup-proofing and power struggles, difficulties with incentives, and a reliance on what I call 'the better angels of our nature'. These angels are fleeting, therefore ideals cannot be achieved. There were also problems of taking Marx literally and not adapting, which is dumb.  But that's another debate for later. 

With this said, I can get to why I don't believe that capitalism is worthwhile anymore. Capitalism incentives profit. That is the only goal, profit. With this incentive in place, one has incentive to do whatever it takes to get profit, which includes pushing the envelope of what is acceptable. This is a double edged sword--it leads to innovation and marvelous developments. But it also leads to corruption, regulatory capture, cover ups of things corporations don't want you to know or believe, and other social corrosion that can utterly invalidate or bring down governments. It also incentives the sabotaging of systems of public good, like the classic example of the NHS. In practice, capitalism will not only find a way to make a free market not free through the construction of monopolies, it will find a way to ensure that all checks and balances against it will be removed. 

Thus, capitalist systems of distribution are not good for the immediate urgency of global warming because they do not have mechanisms to engage in the immediate, massive, radical change needed to preserve some remnants of the ecosystem. Through the mechanisms I have described, capitalist entities will delay and thwart the changes needed to prevent catastrophe all to keep making money. Theoretically, the markets will adopt efficient and green technologies. Practically, we have seen that energy players will greenwash, invest in non-solutions such as hydrogen, lobby, and hire entire departments to spread doubt instead of making the requisite changes.",False,1659116856.0,t3_waujzq,t1_ii501xp,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

The USSR was the worst offender, the CCP was right behind them. I do not believe that M-L originated socially reorganizing revolutions as we have seen them were anything above the quality of the French Revolution 1789; they fell victim to the worst excesses and even mirrored each other in their decadences. Socialism has striven only to maximize outputs because it either needed to industrialize, or was being driven to satiate the demands of leaders whose chronic insecurities and foolish ideas were given free reign. 

Social change under socialism will not seek to elevate the workers' living conditions to the maximum possible level, but to guarantee abundance--that there is enough for everyone. Short-termism in the USSR and China was driven by dogmatism that sped up industrialization at the sake of worker, who should have been elevated. This became no different than the endemic short-termism that is rife in capitalist economies today. 

Rigid industrial planning is why socialist economies failed; and crash industrialization was only partially successful at best. However, these economies were being made to do everything at once by extremely limited people, economic warfare aside, they were set up to fail. You will find far better examples of success in communal settings or anarchist groups than at the state level; in addition to this, you will likely find potential in using AI and highly distributed networks of sensors to determine need and resource flow--but this is science fiction, for now. In an ecological sense, these socialist principles, had they been employed by persons larger than their egos, would have been able to pull a handbrake, stop operations, and clean up the mess without much hesitation. Markets, however, would not.

This is because capitalism incentivizes profit *and nothing else*.

There is a difference between ""being different"" and ""acting different"".

> however those in power rely on acceptance of the powerless - either by choice or coercion.

I'm not sure how else to tell you that resisting oppression is not as simple as not ""accepting"". Resistance in authoritarian regimes usually means death **or worse**. That's a terrifying thing to demand of people just to meet a definition of ""decent person"".

> That hope is what keeps Putin’s knives in motion.

What do you imagine would happen if that hope didn't exist? Would people speak out any more than they are, given the punishments that still await them for doing so? How does hope or lack thereof change those consequences?

Fundamentally, I understand people are dying in Ukraine, but I don't think that means demanding people to die in Russia on behalf of Ukraine just to be ""decent"" is reasonable. The world simply does not have so many saints, and setting such a high bar for ""good"" only means that the majority of humanity will always be ""bad"".

The goal is to make sure that authoritarian regimes don't appear in the first place and are pushed back before they take full control; demanding that people in such a regime offer everything, including their families and lives, to resist that regime is simply a pipe dream.

People don't have to abide by it.  They chose to abide by it.  Look at women's suffrage as one of many examples where centuries of cultural norms were thrown off because the people chose not to continue that culture.

There are real cases of dissent and brave protests in Russia, but my impression is widespread challenge of the status quo requires extraordinary people or extraordinary events. Kremlin sadly does a great job of suppressing or killing the former. 

Maybe Ukraine can be a catalyst though. Hundreds of thousands of young men coming home traumatized, maimed, or in coffins ultimately for nothing if Ukraine wins has got to do something.

We literally define those kind of governments ""non-political"" as they are led by people who have not been elected and the leadership falls on people that is not associated with any political party.
