Close to the fight to seize Ukraine’s capital, doctors adjust and improvise to treat the injured

“The types of wounds that the hospital encounters have evolved with the war, Dr. Khomenko said. In the first week, the hospital received a tide of gunshot wounds as gunbattles between Ukrainian troops and Russian provocateurs broke out in the city, Dr. Khomenko said.

Soon more patients arrived with shrapnel wounds and concussions, as both sides moved their artillery into position and began blasting one another from a distance.”

“ Like front-line hospitals in any war, controlling bleeding is the most important function of its emergency room, and massive blood transfusions are common, surgeons at the hospital said. Dr. Khomenko said that has made the hospital’s leading vascular surgeon, Makhmud Akmad, a leader in trauma treatment.

Born in Gaza, Dr. Akmad came to Ukraine to study medicine and decided to stay after meeting a fellow student who became his wife. Until last month he mostly performed scheduled heart surgeries. After Russia’s invasion, he and his wife moved into one of the hospital’s rooms with their daughter and son, who is studying to be a vascular surgeon like him.

Together, he and his son are on 24-hour call, running to the emergency room whenever several wounded patients appear there. Dr. Akmad said he also gets calls from his relatives in Gaza. “They tell me to come back to Gaza, that Ukraine is too dangerous,” he said. “I tell them that I will stay here, Ukraine is my home now.””

Moscow's media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, issued a statement Sunday warning Russian news outlets against rebroadcasting or distributing an interview between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a group of independent Russian journalists.

The lengthy video interview, posted in full on Zelensky's Telegram channel, featured questions from some of Russia's most prominent independent journalists, including author Mikhail Zygar and Tikhon Dzyadko, the editor-in-chief of the recently shuttered channel TV Rain. 

""Russia must know the truth,"" Zelensky said. ""Russian journalists from the Zygar YouTube channel, TV Rain, the Meduza portal, and the Kommersant and Novaya Gazeta publications received answers to all questions.""

Roskomnadzor followed with a statement on Telegram noting that some of the outlets have formally been branded as ""foreign agents"" by the Russian government.

> 
> US President Joe Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" during a speech in Poland and a Ukrainian city, which until now has been largely spared from Russian assault, was hit by missiles on Saturday.
> 
> *Here are the latest developments in the war on Ukraine:*
> 
> **Missiles strike Lviv:** The city's Mayor Andriy Sadovyi called for air defense of Ukraine after a series of Russian missiles struck a fuel storage facility and a military infrastructure site in the western Ukrainian city, close to the Polish border. At least five people were reportedly injured in Lviv, which been previously spared the worst of Russia's brutal onslaught, local officials said.
> 
> **Biden's speech:** In neighboring Poland, Biden declared that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" during a sweeping speech that called on democracies to stand together. The White House said afterward that it was not a call for regime change. The US President also said that Russia has ""strangled democracy"" in its invasion of Ukraine and warned Putin to not ""even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.” He also labeled Putin a ""butcher"" after visiting with Ukrainian refugees in Warsaw earlier in the day. The US also said it intends to provide “an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance"" to Ukraine.
> 
> **Zelensky calls for more aid:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reiterated his plea for international partners to step up their military assistance, saying his country only asks for 1% of NATO's tanks and planes. In a Saturday video message, Zelensky said the need to strengthen common security in Europe was raised during his two conversations with Polish President Andrezj Duda Saturday. 
> 
> **Ukrainian counterattacks:** Ukrainian officials say the country's military has retaken several villages from Russian troops in a series of counterattacks. Kharkiv's regional administrator said a number of villages around Malaya Rogan were retaken by Ukrainian forces and video shows Ukrainian troops in control of Vilkhivka, one of the settlements. The success of Ukrainian forces around Kharkiv has been mirrored further north, near the city of Sumy, where Ukrainian troops have liberated a number of settlements, according to videos geolocated and verified by CNN. A separate counterattack in the south also led to the liberation of two villages from Russian forces northwest of Mariupol, according to the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration.
> 
> **Captured city:** Zelensky said Russia will not ""subdue"" the captured Slavutych, after Russian forces entered the city Saturday following days of fighting. The city was built to house workers of the nearby Chornobyl nuclear power plant and hundreds of locals amassed in the city square protesting the arrival of the troops. Russian forces briefly detained the city's mayor but eventually released him, according to a statement from Ukrainian political party Sluha Narodu. 
> 
> **Evacuations:** Two seriously injured children and an infant with pneumonia were among 5,208 people evacuated Saturday, the deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine said. Among them were 4,331 residents of the besieged city of Mariupol, who reached the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia. It came as Ukrainian authorities said bus convoys trying to evacuate civilians were being stopped and held by Russian forces, as part of what they claimed to be a pressure campaign to force some residents to go to Russia.

**In Ukraine**


👉🆕 The head of Ukraine's military intelligence says the season of a ""total Ukrainian guerilla safari"" will soon begin and that ""how to survive"" will be the only relevant scenario left for the Russians. He also notes that he believes Russia is looking to partition Ukraine, likening it with North and South Korea

👉🆕 Russian forces at the airfield in the Chornobaivka suburb of Kherson were hit for the 11th time by Ukrainian artillery according to Presidential adviser and spokesman Oleksiy Arestovych

👉🆕 The Security Service of Ukraine has detained collaborators, informants and Russian agents in multiple areas during the past 24h, including in Dnipro, Kharkiv, Odesa, Poltava and Ivano-Frankivsk

👉🆕 Ukraine's General Staff says in their latest update that they see Russian forces continuing to try and take control of Chernihiv in the north, that they have withdrawn after suffering losses east of Kyiv in Luk'yanivka and Rudnytske areas, and that they are trying to regroup their forces in the Sumy Oblast and near Kharkiv. They also claim that Russian forces have met no success in attempting to capture Popasna, Rubizhne, Severodonetsk and Mariupol

👉🆕 British Defence Intelligence say they see the battlefield across northern Ukraine as largely static, with local Ukrainian counterattacks hampering Russian attempts to reorganise. They also note that Russian forces appear to be concentrating their efforts on encircling Ukrainian forces in the eastern parts of the country, advancing from the Kharkiv direction in the northeast and Mariupol in the south

👉🆕 Ukraine's Minister of Agriculture says grain exports have decreased to just several hundred thousand tons per month instead of the 4-5 million tons per month before the invasion

👉🆕 An oil depot in Dubno, Rivne Oblast, was struck by cruise missiles late yesterday evening, Rivne's Governor says

👉🆕 Leader of Russian proxy and puppet state Luhansk ""People's Republic"" says a referendum may be held soon on annexation by Russia, with that being their goal

👉🆕 A Russian Su-34 aircraft was reportedly shot down by Ukrainian air defence units near Izyum

👉🆕 Zaporizhzhia's Military Administration claims Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive towards the north-west of Mariupol, liberating the villages of Malynivka and Poltavka

👉🆕 Kharkiv's Governor says Ukrainian troops have retaken the village of Husarivka to the northwest of Izyum. Some 60 units of military equipment was destroyed or captured from the 2 Russian BTGs defending the area. He also states that there's heavy fighting ongoing in the Izyum area

👉🆕 An adviser to the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims Russia is deliberately destroying Ukrainian oil and food reserves, and that there are signs of new Russian troops gathering at the border

👉🆕 2022's Kharkiv Music Fest has opened in the Kharkiv metro this year and not at the Kharkiv Philharmonic

👉🆕 Residents of occupied Kherson city are again protesting the Russian occupation, with some attempts by Russian soldiers to disperse the protest. Several hundred people in occupied Nova Kakhovka in Kherson are also out protesting

👉🆕 Mariupol's Mayor says the Russian army did not come to Mariupol to liberate it, but to wipe out the city along with its residents, 50% of which identified as ethnic Russian. He says the city stands despite their efforts and remains mostly under Ukrainian control, with Russian-led forces occupying the outskirts. Nearly half of all apartment buildings are damaged beyond repair, and half of the population have left the city, with some 20k-30k people forcibly deported to Russia and Russian-controlled areas

👉🆕 A video has been spread through social media purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers shooting at least three Russian PoWs in the leg, with another video showing several more with identical wounds nearby. Some sources claim it's Azov Battalion forces doing this in Mariupol, and that it was done to ensure those soldiers would not re-enter the fight, as they have no means to keep prisoners in the urban fighting, but some of the footage is indeed quite gruesome and shows attempted interrogations with soldiers on the verge of bleeding out. Whatever the reasoning, and whoever did it, it's a clear war crime

👉🆕 5,208 people were evacuated through the humanitarian corridors yesterday, and the about 4,000 people that were blocked by Russian checkpoints near Berdyansk have finally reached Zaporizhzhia. Only 2 humanitarian corridors have been agreed upon for today, from Luhansk and Donetsk regions. There will also be evacuation trains running from Kharkiv, Dnipro, Kramatorsk and Odesa

👉🆕 Russian forces reportedly used white phosphorus against Ukrainian soldiers near Avdiivka late last night. This would according to one OSINT analyst be the third night in a row

👉🆕 Ukraine's Air Force says they destroyed 18 air targets yesterday: 1 plane, 12 UAVs, 5 missiles

👉🆕 Kharkiv saw about 15 air and artillery attacks during the night, but no casualties have been reported. Ukrainian forces in and near Kharkiv have held the lines, with counter-attacks in some areas

👉🆕 Russian forces tried to seize Popasna and Rubizhne in Luhansk Oblast. In some districts of these cities, street fighting was still ongoing during the morning. In Popasna a large Russian assault supported by artillery was repulsed with heavy losses suffered by the attacking forces. In total some 7 attacks in the Donbas area were repulsed with enemy losses amounting to 8 tanks, 8 armoured vehicles and 3 cars. Casualty numbers are still being tallied

👉🆕 Intensive fighting has been reported in Novovorontsovka that is in the northeastern part of Kherson Oblast, with artillery shelling performed by both sides

👉🆕 Another town in the Sumy Oblast, Boromlya, was liberated yesterday evening after Trostyanets was. Sumy's Governor says humanitarian aid has been delivered to Boromlya and Trostyanets to be distributed by volunteers with loudspeakers, as communications in the area are still down. The Governor also asked residents to be careful as a lot of areas in the towns are mined

**Politics/Diplomacy**


👉🆕 Pope Francis today said the threat of global conflict spawned by Russia's invasion of Ukraine should convince everyone that ""the time has come for humanity to abolish war before it abolishes humanity""

👉🆕 Leader of Russian proxy and puppet state ""Luhansk People's Republic"" says a referendum may be held soon on annexation by Russia, with that being their goal. A Russian State Duma representative said a short time later that it is ""not the right time"" to hold such a referendum

Russia cannot make repair parts and logistics of repair parts just became impossible for any users of their weapon systems.

So many countries that opted for cheap Russian weapons just had their entire military bricked from lack of parts and will have to find a new nation to buy from.

They can't pivot to China either, who is so new to this industry they don't have the infrastructure necessary to support tons of buyers. Even if they could, Chinese aviation relies on Russian engines because they are cheaper and more scalable.

Latin America has some designs, but they are in the same boat as China, they have no logistics to support the repairs all these nations need. Even with their indigenous designs, its going to take a long time for them to get experience being major players on the arms trade. That's not counting the fact their designs are for Latin American use and not geared to Russia's usual buyers. Outside of gun designs and IFVs, Latin America largely cant do what Russia or China does.

A whole lot of countries just got notice their entire military is now on borrowed time and have to replace basically everything before wear and tear grinds them down to nothing.",1648358235.0,1648357123.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,94,0,94,0,0,

It seems fairly apparent that through corruption - money being pocketed etc the army and its equipment was not kept or developed as intended. 

Furthermore the Bellingcat investigation details that money earmarked for spreading pro Russian propaganda in Ukraine was never spent as intended. 

The impact of these actions will have had a clear and very detrimental impact on the Russian army’s ‘special operation’ 

The lack of transparency allowed this originally but is that lack of transparency now meaning that even now Putin is being shielded from (a) how poorly the Russian army has performed and (b) the scale of the resistance from Ukraine. 

I don’t think Putin a stupid man and clearly there has been a massive miscalculation in his actions but was this led by misinformation and does that still continue? 

I’m not wishing to sound like I’m defending Putin but he’s the man who can end this and if he doesn’t have a clear view of what is going on he is less likely to do that.

> 
> Russia’s 1998 financial collapse looms large in his thinking and may explain why the country is still paying interest on its debt.
> 
> By Judy Shelton | 
> March 24, 2022 6:53 pm ET
> 
> Russia last week surprised many observers by fulfilling its obligation to pay interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. The coupon payments, amounting to $117 million, were required to service two Russian government bond offerings—one maturing in 2023 and another in 2043. Creditors noted that, against expectations, the payments were received in dollars—which means Russia remains in compliance with the terms of the offerings.
> 
> While the U.S. has barred most transactions by American institutions with Russia’s central bank and Finance Ministry, a temporary exemption from the Treasury Department permits Russia to make these debt payments through May 25.
> 
> The question of whether Russia continues to honor its contractual bond obligations in foreign currencies goes beyond consideration of its financial capacity as a nation or even its ability to justify default in the face of harsh Western sanctions. Fear of failure in the global financial arena has haunted Russian leaders since the Soviet government suspended foreign-debt servicing in January 1918 and repudiated all bonds issued under the czarist government—some carrying maturity dates 80 years into the future.
> 
> Mr. Putin’s perspective on the connection between currency stability, public debt and access to foreign capital was formed in this crucible of financial desperation and national humiliation. It continues to influence his thinking and actions.
> 
> It is difficult to fathom the psyche of a person who dismisses the territorial integrity of independent states and brutally targets civilians, while appearing at the same time obsessively concerned about being viewed as financially fastidious. But it’s important that we try to understand Russia’s leader—his motivations and objectives, his primal fears and self-aggrandizing ambitions—for strategic reasons. As Sun Tzu advises: Know your enemy.

A greater distance between target and explosion increases the cones area of effect. Like a claymore the weapon is still deadly 50 meters away from the explosion. The drone can be moved closer before exploding to focus the ball bearings and destroy vehicles like supply trucks, ammo dumps, radars, towed artillery, but not armoured vehicles. It has fuel for 6 miles of travel/15 minutes in the air. It costs 6,000 dollars which is shockingly cheap considering a javelin costs 200,000 dollars plus.There are 1000 of these drones with 100 launchers on their way or in Ukraine.

The total cost of these missiles exceeds $340 million in direct production costs in 2020 prices, and, taking into account logistics, up to half a billion dollars at a time only with volleys from ships of the Black Sea Fleet.
> 
> **At the same time, Ukrainian air defense set a record for downed targets: out of at least 70 missiles fired by Russia, only eight made it to their targets. The rest were destroyed in the sky.** Russia carried out shelling, including on the territory located in the immediate vicinity of the Polish border. On the same day, US President Joe Biden was visiting.
> 
> Earlier sources of The Insider reported that Russia fired up to 50 missiles on the territory of Ukraine on March 26. Some of them fell on Lviv: the Russian side fired at a fuel depot and a defense facility.

“Intelligence agencies have been slow to respond to the growing scope of covert Kremlin operations overseas

“What we know about [it] is almost certainly the tip of the iceberg,” said Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow of the Russia programme at Chatham House. “For many years there has been a conspiracy of silence, with western powers reluctant to talk about Russian activities or even go after them.”

Eight serving European intelligence officials and diplomats interviewed by the Financial Times said Russia’s covert operations in Europe had been expanding at a rate that counter-espionage efforts have struggled to match. Several countries still rely on US and UK intelligence gathering because of restrictions on domestic surveillance and a lack of resources.”

“ Dozens of Russian agents are still active in Germany, France and Belgium, according to the assessment of one European intelligence official.

Austria is a “veritable aircraft carrier” of covert Russian activity, said another. Its BFV intelligence agency is regarded as being so compromised that for a time it was cut out of much European intelligence sharing activity, according to one Vienna-based European diplomat. The country’s defence ministry is “practically a department of the GRU”, the diplomat added.”

""No free world leader should hesitate to state plainly that the world would be a far better place if Putin were no longer in power in Russia. A good way to make that come about is to say exactly that. Russia will be pariah until Putin is gone. 

Putin has stayed in power for over 20 years because despite leading Russia to economic, demographic, and political ruin, he is still treated like the big boss who can do business and get things back on track. Shatter that belief. 

Dictators crush even the smallest hint of opposition so they can say ""if not me, who else?"" After 20 years, it is effective. But we must all imagine Russia after Putin for it to happen. No normalization, no deals, nothing. He is illegitimate and a war criminal. 

If it's impolitic or a slip to speak the truth, so be it. As I wrote today, Putin's war in Ukraine and against the world order will not end as long as he is in power. Either the war criminal is isolated or he isn't. No more half-measures.

If he feels the need to explain, Biden can agree with Putin's spokesworm Peskov, who said the Russian people should decide who is in power. Yes, they should. And free and fair elections will finally come when Putin is gone. 

Biden isn't Trump, requiring an English to English translator! No dictator is legitimate. Don't backpedal when you are right and in the right. Don't play diplomatic games with a mass murderer.

> 
> **KEY FACTS**
> 
> * Ukrainian defense intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov said in a statement Russia might attempt to politically split Ukraine based on occupied and non-occupied areas, which he said would effectively create a ""North and South Korea in Ukraine,"" according to a Reuters translation.
> 
> * A senior Pentagon official told reporters Friday the Russian military ""at the moment"" is no longer mounting a ground offensive toward the capital, noting forces were ""digging in"" to create ""defensive positions.""
> 
> * The Kremlin suggested a change in strategy on Friday by announcing Russia was focusing on the ""liberation"" of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, which Russian-backed rebels have partially controlled since 2014.
> 
> * U.S. Ambassador to the UN Julianne Smith told CNN's State of the Union Sunday that Western officials aren't convinced Russia has given up its goal of capturing the entirety of Ukraine, after multiple rockets struck Lviv in western Ukraine on Saturday.
> 
> * Budanov also warned that any Russian attempt to maintain control of Ukrainian territory would lead to an ongoing insurgency.

Excerpt:

> When the interview with three New York Times journalists at last began, Mr. Putin was cordial and focused, comfortable in his strong command of detail. “We firmly stand on the path of development of democracy and of a market economy,” he said, adding, “By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans.”
> 
> He spoke of “good, close relations” with the Bush administration, despite the Iraq war, and said “the main principles of humanism — human rights, freedom of speech — remain fundamental for all countries.” The greatest lesson of his education, he said, was “respect for the law.”
> 
> At this time, Mr. Putin had already clamped down on independent media; prosecuted a brutal war in Chechnya involving the leveling of Grozny, its capital; and placed security officials — known as siloviki — front and center in his governance. Often, they were old St. Petersburg buddies, like Nikolai Patrushev, now the secretary of Mr. Putin’s security council. The first rule of an intelligence officer is suspicion.
> 
> When asked about his methods, the president bristled, suggesting America could not claim any moral high ground. “We have a proverb in Russia,” he said. “One should not criticize a mirror if you have a crooked face.”
> 
> The overriding impression was of a man divided behind his unflinching gaze. Michel Eltchaninoff, the French author of “Inside the Mind of Vladimir Putin,” said there was “a varnish of liberalism to his discourse in the early 2000s,” but the pull of restoring Russian imperial might, and so avenging Russia’s perceived relegation to what President Barack Obama would call “a regional power,” was always Mr. Putin’s deepest urge.
> 
> Born in 1952 in a city then called Leningrad, Mr. Putin grew up in the shadow of the Soviets’ war with Nazi Germany, known to Russians as the Great Patriotic War. His father was badly wounded, an older brother died during the brutal 872-day German siege of the city, and a grandfather had worked for Stalin as a cook. The immense sacrifices of the Red Army in defeating Nazism were not abstract but palpable within his modest family, as for many Russians of his generation. Mr. Putin learned young that, as he put it, “the weak get beat.”
> 
> “The West did not take sufficient account of the strength of Soviet myth, military sacrifice and revanchism in him,” Mr. Eltchaninoff, whose grandparents were all Russian, said. “He believes deeply that Russian man is prepared to sacrifice himself for an idea, whereas Western man likes success and comfort.”

I'll outline them and explain how close the West is to implementing them''

1) Cutting Russian banks off from SWIFT 

Major Russian banks were cut off from SWIFT early in the war, but since then, the West's approach has been more incremental

Poland believes these delays could allow Russia to get around SWIFT (ie. by working with China and India)

2) Asylum for Russian Military Defectors

This idea has gained traction by US academics led by Timur Khan from Duke University, but has received limited discussion in the US or EU 

Potential spy infiltration might be reason

3) Suspend Russian propaganda in Europe 

RT and Sputnik have been thrown off the air in Britain and the EU

Switzerland has objected to this ban, saying fighting disinformation with facts is a better strategy

4) Block Russian ships from European ports 

Britain announced a ban on February 28, and while the EU hinted at something similar on March 1, it was reported by March 11 that this ban was a ""distant prospect""

5) Block Road Transport in and out of Russia 

Concerns are growing about road freight through Belarus being used to evade sanctions 

But trucks still move through European countries, including hawkish nations like Lithuania

6) Sanction Oligarchs and their entire business environment 

Individual sanctions took effect first, but the West is moving to crack down on state-owned companies with some loopholes in the energy sector

The US sanctioning Rosatom again would be a big move in this direction

7) Ban visas for all Russians entering the EU

An extreme measure, which might be viewed by many as too much collective punishment 

Joe Biden's efforts to distinguish between the Kremlin and Russian people in Warsaw push subtly against this

8) Sanction all members of the United Russia Party

Another measure that is hard to implement, especially as United Russia has over 2 million card-carrying supporters

9) Ban Export of Technologies Russia Might Use for War 

Lots of discussions about this, but slow progress

The EU just sounded the alarm about China supplying tech hardware for war, which could get awkward if the West is doing so as well

10) Exclude Russia from all International Organizations

The US backs Poland's proposal to kick Russia out of the G20, but Interpol has resisted pressure to expel it

Expulsion from UN bodies, such as the UN Human Rights Council and especially, the UNSC are much harder sells

Per Wikipedia, prior to the invasion, the party leader of the local Czech socialist party had promised “Westernization” reformations, including democracy and looser restrictions on freedom of speech, which prompted secret plans of a coup from the more authoritarian, Kremlin-backed branch of the party: 

>**In 1968, party leader Alexander Dubček proposed reforms that included a democratic process and initiated the Prague Spring; this led to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union.** Under pressure from the Kremlin, all reforms were repealed, party leadership became taken over by its more authoritarian wing, and a massive non-bloody purge of party members was conducted.

Prior to the invasion, the Soviet troops were deliberately misled, having been told by the Kremlin and the Kremlin-backed conspirators that Czechoslovakia needed assistance to “liberate” the country from a cabal of USSR-hating, right-wing nationalists who were attempting to take over Czechoslovakia with NATO’s assistance:

>**Many of the invading soldiers told the Czechs that they were there to “liberate” them from West German and other NATO hegemony.**

>[…]

>[In the early 1990s] the Russian government gave the new Czechoslovak President, Václav Havel, a copy of a letter of invitation addressed to Soviet authorities and signed by KSČ members Biľak, Švestka, Kolder, Indra, and Kapek. **It claimed that ""right-wing"" media were ""fomenting a wave of nationalism and chauvinism, and are provoking an anti-communist and anti-Soviet psychosis"". It formally asked the Soviets to ""lend support and assistance with all means at your disposal"" to save the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic ""from the imminent danger of counterrevolution"".** 

The Czech leadership, blissfully ignorant of the coup that was taking place, did not expect an invasion, believing that it would be too costly, despite warnings and ominous movements by the attacking army precluding the invasion:

> The [Czech] regime took no steps to forestall a potential invasion, **despite ominous troop movements by the Warsaw Pact. The Czechoslovak leadership believed that the Soviet Union and its allies would not invade,** having believed that the summit at Čierna nad Tisou had smoothed out the differences between the two sides. **They also believed that any invasion would be too costly,** both because of domestic support for the reforms and because the international political outcry would be too significant . . . 

Massive amounts of refugees fled the country, and the remaining Czech civilians all united together to resist the invasion; their fierce resistance took the Soviet army off-guard, who had anticipated a much shorter operation:

> A massive wave of emigration swept the nation. Resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. **While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, the resistance held out for eight months** until diplomatic maneuvers finally circumvented it.

After international backlash and the emergency UN meeting following the invasion, USSR diplomats refused to acknowledge the operation as an invasion, insisting that they were assisting militarily against “antisocial forces”: 

>The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom and the United States all requested a session of the United Nations Security Council . . . That afternoon, on August 21, the council met to hear the Czechoslovak Ambassador Jan Muzik denounce the invasion. **Soviet Ambassador Jacob Malik insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were those of ""fraternal assistance"" against ""antisocial forces"".**

Protestors of the invasion in Moscow’s Red Square were arrested, under the pretense of the protestors being anti-USSR:

>On 25 August, at the Red Square, eight protesters carried banners with anti-invasion slogans. **The demonstrators were arrested and later punished, as the protest was dubbed ""anti-Soviet"".**

Interestingly, many in the KGB and security forces were shocked and outraged at the invasion, leading to them secretly feeding information to Western intelligence… a possible clue as to the source of America’s intel for Putin’s invasion? 

>One unintended consequence of the invasion was that **many within the Soviet State security apparatus and Intelligence Services were shocked and outraged at the invasion** and several KGB/GRU defectors and spies such as Oleg Gordievsky, Vasili Mitrokhin, and Dmitri Polyakov **have pointed out the 1968 invasion as their motivation for cooperating with the Western Intelligence agencies.**",False,1648406479.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Western powers don’t exactly have permission to walk into Russia and verify their claims of strength, so they often have to make assessments based partially on Russian projections. Analytics are based on available information. But consider this - when analyzing Russia’s capabilities I am certain they take a certain percentage off in their calculations. So if Russia says they have 1000 of something, analysts likely assume that is it more factually 750 (25% less than claimed). So, when we see that the western intelligence community concluded that the actual strength was X, it was based on the fact that we assumed Russia had been trying to convince everyone that their strength was X+25%

This situation though has blown open a very incredible reality. I don’t think anyone realized Russia has been so exceptionally good at propaganda. We all assumed that they were talking up their strength from X, where in reality they were closer to X - 25%!

I don’t know anyone who would have looked at the original numbers and assumed that the true value was 50% or less. Its unimaginable, and It’s insane that they had us convinced that they were so much stronger than they are.",False,1648402788.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Even if you think your goals are pure, like getting humanitarian aid into Ukraine, groveling before Putin is never going to be the most effective way to achieve them. It gives him more chips to gamble with. Then he’ll take more hostages to gain more.

Macron should have his next humiliating chat with Putin in Mariupol. Engagement with a dictator is a loss of leverage and a show of weakness. Pressure comes from isolation, which targets Putin’s hold on power, the only thing he cares about.""

First are those who “don’t mind a long war because it would mean exhausting Russia, even if this means the demise of Ukraine and comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives.” Others want a quick end to the fighting because “Russia's market is a big one [and] their economies are suffering”. They would like to see Russia keep certain markets. A third, more diverse, group of countries “recognise Nazism in Russia” and want Ukraine to prevail. They are joined by smaller liberal countries that “want the war to end quickly at any cost, because they think people come first”. And last are the embarrassed countries that want peace now and in any way possible, because they are “the offices of the Russian Federation in Europe.”

Mr Zelensky praises America and Britain. Although he notes that the complexities of American politics have sometimes caused delays, he acknowledges that Mr Biden has become increasingly engaged. But Germany, he says, is trying to strike a balance between Russia and Ukraine. “They have a long relationship with Russia and they are looking at the situation through the prism of the economy,” he says. “They can help, if there is pressure on them domestically to do so, and they can stop when they see what they have done is sufficient.” Asked why leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France would not supply tanks to help Ukraine win, he retorts that “they are afraid of Russia. And that’s it.”

**Ukraine urges Red Cross not to open Russian office:**

Ukraine has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) not to open a planned office in southern Russia, saying it would legitimise Moscow's ""humanitarian corridors"" and the alleged abduction and forced deportations of Ukrainians.  
  
Earlier, Russian media reported the head of the Red Cross had asked Russia to facilitate the opening of a Red Cross office in Rostov-on-Don, where temporary accommodation camps have been erected by Russia for people transported from Ukraine.  
  
Iryna Vereshchuk, Ukraine's top humanitarian official, who says Russia has created the sham safe corridors, says the Red Cross is being ""used"" by the Russians.  
  
But the ICRC has told Reuters it has no ""first-hand"" information about reports of forced evacuations to Russia from Ukraine and it does not facilitate any such operations.  
  
It says its priority ""is to reach victims of armed conflict, wherever they are, in order to assist them"".",False,1648410596.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Greece also wouldn’t bar Russian ships from its ports. It also let Greece’s shipping oligarchs keep sending vessels to Russia to make money because even in war – especially in war – there’s plenty of that to be made, and makes some very rich.

Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky are both native Russian-speakers, but they talk a different language of power. Mr Putin’s world, where life is cheap and history belongs to great men, has no place for pity and no room for Ukraine. “I don’t think he visualises in his own mind the same Ukraine we see,” Mr Zelensky says. “He sees Ukraine as a part of his world, his worldview, but that doesn't correspond with what's happened over the last 30 years. I don't think Putin has been [in] a bunker for two weeks or six months, but for more like two decades.”

*******

And what does Mr Zelensky believe Ukraine’s victory will look like? He pauses. Everyone has their own version of victory and defeat. To Mr Putin victory is about the destruction of Ukraine as Russia’s antithesis, and about the killing of people who have free will and who have put human life and feelings above state, ideology or religion. When Mr Zelensky finally speaks, he talks about life and everything it entails— humanity, compassion, and freedom.

“Victory is being able to save as many lives as possible…because without this nothing would make sense. Our land is important, yes, but ultimately, it's just territory.” To save everyone, defend all interests while protecting people and not giving up territory is probably an impossible task, he concedes. He does not know when or how it will end, but he knows that “it will end with us still standing here defending” life in Ukraine.

****

“It's not about being brave,” he says. “I have to act the way I do.” He did not prepare for the role of war hero. “If you don’t know how to do something this way or that way, be honest and that’s it. You have to be honest, so that people believe you. You don’t need to try. You need to be yourself…And it’s important not to show that you are better than who you are.”

International investment in Ukraine post-war is likely to be huge. 

People are so stuck on land gains, they don't realize that Putin has lost more than he can ever hope to gain back by getting territory in Ukraine already.

Tl;DR: As Zelenskyy has stated, Russia has no future:

The Russian military has been exposed as a rotten corrupted mess that couldn't hope to decisively win against any conventional army in an offensive war.

The Russian military is losing a significant portion of its own working equipment.

Russian military equipment has been exposed as junk, making countries that buy it think twice about doing so.

Nato now has a united purpose, and european countries are increasing their defense spending.

Countries bordering Russia that weren't in NATO before are now highly considering joining when they weren't before.

Companies will want nothing to do with a country as unstable as his, that would consider nationalizing their property, that stole the planes they had leased from European nations, so their economy is irrevocably damaged. This is even assuming that sanctions get dropped, which they might not all be.

Customer countries will move away from dependence on Russian resources.

They're losing tens of thousands of young people in a country whose average age is 40 and whose population has been declining for decades.

Hundreds of thousands of young and educated Russians are fleeing the country, causing a brain drain and further worsening the population decline of the country.

Internationally, no sane country will take Russia's word seriously any longer even if they act friendly.

Russia's satellite countries have all refused to help Russia, thus revealing their own internal instability/disloyalty.

Countries around the world are quickening their efforts to wean themselves off fossil fuels because of the disruption, further weakening Russia.

Basically: it's exactly what Zelenskyy says: Russia has no future.",False,1648416421.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

>  
>Russian troops in Ukraine have relied, with surprising frequency, on unsecured communication devices such as smartphones and push-to-talk radios, leaving units vulnerable to targeting, and further underscoring the command-and-control deficiencies that have come to define Moscow’s month-long invasion, observers say.  
>  
>“We’re seeing them use a lot more unclassified communications because their classified communications capability, … for one reason or another, is not as strong as it should be,” a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the Pentagon, told reporters in a recent news briefing.  
>  
>The Russian military possesses modern equipment capable of secure transmission, but troops on the battlefield have reached for simpler-to-use but less-secure lines because of uneven discipline across the ranks, an apparent lack of planning for conducting a sustained fight over long distances, and Russian attacks on Ukraine’s communication infrastructure that it, too, has relied on, experts say.  
>  
>A European intelligence official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss NATO’s battlefield assessments, said that since the invasion began in late-February, there have been multiple instances of Russian commanders confiscating their subordinates’ personal phones for fear they would unwittingly give away a unit’s location.  
>  
>Similarly, Ukrainian civilians have reported having their phones stolen by Russian troops who use them to speak with one another and with family back home, this official said. Those calls, the official noted, have revealed troops’ frustrations and declining morale as Ukraine’s military has stymied Russia’s advance around key cities, killing thousands of Russians in the process.  
>  
>The Pentagon on Friday said that its latest intelligence showed Russian forces had lost full control of Kherson, a port city along the Black Sea, as Ukraine expands its offensive operations in key part of the country and Russia appears to be have shifted its emphasis to the separatist Donbas region in the east. Ukrainian forces also have pushed back Russian advances outside the northern city of Chernihiv with other offensives underway in the western suburbs of Kyiv, the capital, the senior U.S. defense official said.  
>  
>There is evidence that the United States and other NATO countries have provided Ukrainian forces with electronic warfare equipment capable of interrupting Russian transmissions and allowing them to target Russian command posts, said Kostas Tigkos, a Russian military expert at the defense analysis firm Janes Group. By destroying Russia’s communication nodes, the Ukrainians could pressure their adversaries to use less-secure equipment, he said, increasing the likelihood their conversations will be intercepted or their positions triangulated.  
>  
>While the Russian military has overhauled its military technology in the last two decades, with some emphasis on modernizing its communication hardware, Tigkos said equipment is only part of the equation. “It’s one thing,” he said, “to develop a good radio that works well. It’s another thing to deploy that radio, build a network, and conduct a complex military operation with thousands of moving parts, and have them work together like a symphony.”  
>  
>Russian military transmissions over unsecured lines have been so prevalent, analysts say, that amateur radio enthusiasts have tuned into them online using sites such as Web SDR. Some conversations have revealed troops’ frustrations. In one transmission on March 5, a Russian service member identifies himself as “Blacksmith,” rather than a call sign. “Don’t say the last names on air!” another responds. The transmission was provided to The Washington Post by Shadow Break International, an open-source intelligence consultancy based in Britain. Audio shared with The Washington Post by Shadow Break International showed Russian soldiers speaking in unsecure radio transmissions in Ukraine on March 5.

>In another discussion, Russian soldiers appear to confuse one another by mistaking their callsigns. One identifies himself as “Exchange.” Another then says that, in fact, that’s his call sign. “You got it all mixed up!” one of them explains.  
>  
>Russian commanders also have exhibited difficulty orchestrating communications over such a vast, dynamic battlefield, analysts say. Their forces are stretched across Ukraine, the largest country in Europe outside Russia, posing challenges for military planners who must coordinate mobile transmission sites and ensure radios are operating on frequencies that must be consistently changed.  
>  
>At the same time, military analysts have cautioned against making sweeping generalizations of the Russians’ communication performance. Some units, they say, may be better equipped and disciplined than others.  
>  
>Photos of Russian equipment captured by Ukrainian forces show sophisticated and secure radios, said Sam Bendett, a Russian military technology expert at the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va. Other imagery show off-the-shelf equipment. Some Russian personnel may use such radios as a means to blend into the wide spectrum of civilian frequencies — like a needle in a haystack, Bendett said — rather than military frequencies that are more limited and detectable with the right equipment.  
>  
>There is anecdotal evidence that Russia’s unsecured communications have led to battlefield losses. One Russian general was purportedly killed in an airstrike after his cellphone was detected by the Ukrainians, the New York Times reported earlier this month.  
>  
>In another instance, shared by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, two Russian intelligence officials were heard discussing over an open frequency the death of a senior officer. When one asked to speak on an encrypted line, the other said it wasn’t working.  
>  
>“We can’t get in touch with anyone at all,” the official said, lamenting his inoperable phone, called the Era. The Russian-made device relies on a cellular network to function, but heavy bombardment has destroyed cell towers in many parts of the country, in turn constraining the Russians’ ability to use secure phones, said Tigkos, the analyst with Janes Group.  
>  
>It’s also likely that senior Russian officers with experience battling less capable forces in other theaters had become somewhat complacent and were caught off guard by how determined Ukrainian forces have proven to be. Russian commanders have rotated through Syria for years, where radios and cellphones could be used without worry of interference or tracking, noted Bendett, of the Center for Naval Analyses.

**Escalation of words could prevent ceasefire, says Macron**

French President Emmanuel Macron is warning against the verbal escalation of the war in Ukraine, a day after his American counterpart Joe Biden described Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a butcher and said he shouldn't be allowed to remain in power.  
  
Macron told French media the goal was for a ceasefire in Ukraine and then the withdrawal of Russian troops.  
  
He said this wouldn't be possible with an escalation through words or actions.  
  
US authorities have denied Biden was calling for regime change in Russia following his unscripted comments during a visit to Poland.  
  
Macron has maintained communication with the Russian president throughout the Ukraine crisis and said he would speak to Putin in the next two days to organise the evacuation of civilians from the heavily bombarded port city of Mariupol.

//

At the bustling tea stands and roadside eateries of Delhi, European politics is not a regular topic of conversation.

But with wall-to-wall coverage of the war in Ukraine on television and in the newspapers, petrol prices rising and pressure growing on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to denounce Russia, Indians are starting to grapple with the consequences of the conflict 2,800 miles away.

Ram Agarwal, a shopkeeper, does not condone the loss of civilian life but nor can he bring himself to criticise Russia. He grew up in the 1950s and 60s when India and the Soviet Union were such close allies that Nikita Khrushchev coined the slogan “Hindi Rusi bhai bhai” (Indians and Russians are brothers).

“I am 74 and my generation grew up with Hindi Rusi bhai bhai. It’s like attacking a dear old friend,” he said.

Arvind Maurya, an electrician, also expressed the even-handedness that has marked much of the public response. “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit. But war is never good for anyone and the Russian bombing of civilians is not the way to solve these differences. They must sit down and talk,” he said.

But away from the street, feelings are stronger.

**'President Biden 'made a difficult situation more difficult'**

US President Joe Biden's comment that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ""cannot remain in power"" has prompted strong criticism from veteran US diplomat Richard Haass.

The comments ""made a difficult situation more difficult and a dangerous situation more dangerous"", tweeted Mr Haass, who is president of the US Council on Foreign Relations.

""That is obvious,"" he added. ""Less obvious is how to undo the damage, but I suggest his chief aides reach their counterparts & make clear the US is prepared to deal with this Russian government.""

Mr Haass returned to the subject after the White House qualified President Biden's remarks, saying: ""The White House walk back of POTUS regime change call is unlikely to wash.

""Putin will see it as confirmation of what he’s believed all along. Bad lapse in discipline that runs risk of extending the scope and duration of the war.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I personally think what Biden said needed to be said. Can't let a cunt like putin run around killing as he wishes.

Funny thing about Biden's comment is that I have two views on the unwalked back version.

I absolutely believe he should have said it, and meant it. I absolutely LOVE the idea of Putin being pissed off by this. Fuck you, Putin. Hahaha.

And with exactly equal fervor I absolutely believe that the United States should NOT actively participate in his downfall. That would be an act of war blah, blah, blah. As funny as it is, we need not to touch him personally.

If you disagree with it, I would appreciate discussion of why, etc. as this is just spitballing. 

TLDR of the realization:  NATO intervention provides Putin with an actual off-ramp that is most likely to save his career at this point.

Longer version:

The military operation in Ukraine is obviously a catastrophic failure for Russia.  The fact it is against Ukraine and old Soviet gear and second tier western gear makes it infinitely worse of Russia's image and by extension Putins.

He cannot afford an L in the current framing and is desperately trying to bend and shape the L to try and look like a W.  But that just isn't happening.  Everyday more and more Russian soldiers are going home in pieces and bodybags.  VERY soon the truth of this will catch up to him.

If NATO were to evaluate however, it would allow Putin to use his ""NATO is mean to us narrative"" and claim most of the losses came after NATO got involved.  He could say how the west is all Nazis and supported the Ukraine Nazis and he did everything he could short of a nuclear war to stop it.  

He could frame the entire loss on NATO intervention and save his hide with his people, potentially making it even easier for him to push through more measures to solidify his power due to the ""obvious"" NATO threat.

And before you ask, Russia and the Soviet Union have used the NATO boogeyman before very very effectively.  To hear the average Russian tell it, everything that is wrong in Russia is due to NATO or their local mayor being corrupt.  This would give Putin the perfect out.

As long as NATO stayed contained to Ukraine's borders Putin would put up a show for ~2 weeks (long enough to give cover for the massive losses) and propose a cease fire and withdrawal.",1648427822.0,1648427607.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Yes, those guys are war criminals now and have to be prosecuted. No apologies there. No complaints either. 

But where were many of those guys who are now screaming bloody murder when Russia was (and still is) systematically committing war crimes? Like, shelling hospitals... bombing shelters... there's even that one video where a BMP completely wrecks that car with the elderly couple. Somehow, almost nobody then spoke up.

U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said that the government will consider lifting sanctions against Russia if there’s a commitment to no further aggression on top of a ceasefire and withdrawal from Ukraine, the Telegraph reported.

The remarks appear to sketch out Britain’s blueprint for an “off ramp” that could be offered to Putin to end his invasion, and chime with remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has said that American sanctions against Russia are “not designed to be permanent” and could “go away” if Moscow changes its behavior, the newspaper reported.

3) Crimean and Donbas populations will vote on who to join. He believes Crimea will vote to join Russia, legitimizing the Russian claim on that region, and that Donbass will vote to stay with Ukraine.

This accomplishes a few things. It brings security to Ukraine and will prevent it from being subjugated by Russia in a future war. It allows Russia to go home and say they succeeded in gaining recognition that Crimea is part of Russia. And Ukraine doesn't lose anymore territory.

You know what's interesting? I recently realized that in English there is a problem with describing the current population of russia. For English-speaking countries they are all ""Russians"", although in fact since 1993 we are all ""rossiyane"" (because it is very difficult to combine ethnic Russianness with, for example, Buryat or Nenets Asian ethnic from the far north). And yes cause if all these relocations in USSR.

In modern Russia, there are practically no typical Ivans, who were usually shown in films about the REDS. 
Here is a country where people have been ""Soviet"" for 80 years, where not only minorities were relocated, but everyone they could. And this makes self-identification MUCH more difficult. 

Even Thirty-five years ago, our ancestors could have been sent to ""work out"" (and this was mandatory) literally to any part of the Soviet Union after graduating from the institute. A person from Ukraine could be sent to Kazakhstan, a person from Buryatia to the Moscow region, a guy from St. Petersburg left for the Far North, well, you understand. People met there, fell in love with each other and as a result: we have practically no families where there would be pure Russian roots: everyone will definitely have a couple of people from the Caucasus, a couple of Asians, someone from the western regions… This was considered normal. 

Interracial and interethnic marriages were very common. After that, people often moved somewhere else, often to a third region, and now the question is: how should their children identify themselves? Who should they consider themselves?


And now there's a shitstorm of our own going on over there. Looking at the video. I want to ask these guys, where do you get your cultural problems, with Ukrainians? Your closest ethnic neighbors are maybe some American Eskimos, what does Europe and Ukraine have to do with them?

First is the Russians have targeted protected populations in the Geneva convention like medical staff, humanitarian workers, and children. While fake markings or violating PoW rights **are** war crimes, they're not remotely on the same level. For example, one (actually confirmed) war crime committed by Ukranians is releasing video of interviews with Russian PoW. While technically a war crime because PoW are supposed to be guaranteed privacy once they're no longer combatants, this is not an act of violence against civilians. There are many war crimes of various degrees of severity between these two extremes. 

Then there's the question of who is the aggressor. Going into another country and slaughtering their doctors and expectant mothers isn't the same as violence against soldiers invading your country. Pretending otherwise is ludicrous. 

Third is the question of if this is official policy of the armed forces, or a discipline problem. The Ukranians appear to have a discipline problem because their armed forces include some minimally trained volunteers (mostly handling checkpoints, but in the worst hit areas involved in other things) while the Russian army appears to have an actual policy from the highest levels of command of intentionally targeting protected populations like children to demoralize Ukranians.",1648393054.0,1648392772.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

I am a junior Russian soldier
And I was born to bring victory to Russia
Our minister Shoigu told me
That we can bring NATO to its knees.


He said that the mission is simple as fuck
That we’ll take Kyiv in just two days
And we’ll bring everyone to their knees
But they blew the shit out of us.


Now we lie around with no arms or legs
And we fertilize the fields for spring
We have become part of the soil
Just lying around, stinking up the place.


At last, they give me the order to capture Kyiv
But we are getting fucked here
Just like the sheep
That Kadyrov’s squad fuck.


Yesterday, for example, I was completely fucked up
Gypsies stole our APC
We are burned with cocktails by young and old
And attacked by some “Bandera” Bayraktar.


We don't know how to find our way
Because all the road signs tell us to fuck off
And while we might seem like heroes
But shit is flowing down our legs.


The enemy is shooting the shit out of us 
everywhere
In Sumy and Chernihiv 
they blow the shit out of us.


It seems we’ve captures Kherson, but
People there are screaming that we are shit
And in Melitipol too
And in Mariupol


I’m a top-level Russian military officer
I have 200,000 fuck ups under my command
It's not my job to keep score of them
Fuckers like them will continue to be spawned


It would have been better 
if I’d died from Covid
Or if I went deaf 
so I can’t hear commands.


There are Javelins and air defense everywhere
My troops have turned to shit
We are all getting blown to shit
In Kharkov and Bucha we were blown to bits.


We were once a great army
But now the entire world knows are shit
They know it in Moldova
They know it Georgia
And soon they’ll all go crazy
And together they’ll fuck us up.",1648403981.0,1648403614.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

It puzzled me why literally **NONE** of the Russian media outlets even discussed the video.

I've checked:

* TASS - Mostly discussing President Biden's speech

* Izvestia - Mostly talking about 'American' bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine

* Kommersant - Probably the most balanced of the Russian news outlets

* Russian Pravda - Just like TASS, but a bit harsher on Biden as a person

* Rossiyskaya Gazeta - Mostly talking about the same bioweapons as Izvestia, but also many articles about the economic results of the 'special operation' and sanctions

* Trud - almost ignoring the war. Besides an article about Biden, this news website is basically pretending that nothing's happening in Ukraine

* Argumenty i Fakty - more Biden criticism among some frankly puzzling articles (aliens? wtf?)

* Moskovskij Komsomolets - Biden talk among other general news articles such as supply disturbances due to sanctions

ecac58e89c05032e8a17bbc94a381b28,tpc0qa,i2buaz0,"Mylovanov:

0/ Good morning. Several notable developments in the war in Ukraine. They are small in scale, but symbolic and might signal a structural change: 1. Lviv bombardment. 2. Kherson is contested. 3. Azerbaijan move on Russian supported territories in Nagorno-Karabakh. 4. Belarus 

1.1/ Lviv was bombed yesterday. In my view, it is a message to Biden, who was visiting Poland. Lviv is the closes and most symbolic location in Ukraine. This is the war of symbols as much as the war of brutality 

1.2/ The Russian message:""we are ruthless, unafraid of the US or NATO, will escalate beyond what you can tolerate, just back off and give up."" Fundamentally, this is a bluff because Russia has not got the economy to truly engage with the West. It can only sprint. 

1.3/ So, Russia creates a stick and a carrot. The stick: Western fear of uncontrolled and unpredictable escalation. The carrot: give up on Ukraine and this will stop (even if temporarily). This approach worked in 2014 in Crimea and Donbas. Why wouldn't it now? 

1.4/ Russia has more time for this strategy to work than most Western observers realize. Russia can sustain the Western sanctions, with a collapsed economy and low living standards, and continue the war in Ukraine.
 
1.5/ It is a false hope that ""the Russian public will turn agains the Kremlin"". It has not done so against Stalin. It has not done so against Putin. Unlike Ukraine, which fought against Stalin for 12 years after WWII. Ukraine twice successfully resisted dictatorships since 1992 

1.6/ Revolutions and resistance works in Ukraine. People know for a fact it can succeed. The future looked very dark in 2013-2014, protesters were shot, the state police turned against its people,. Ukrainians kept pushing and one day the regime simply collapsed. 

1.7/ Furthermore, revolutions in Ukraine restore democracy, while revolutions in Russia bring about authoritarian governments that impose terror 

1.8/ In the typical Russian manner, the Kremlin will double down and be able to continue aggression for months and, possibly, years, despite the sanctions. But Ukraine will resist. The fight is existential for Ukrainians and they (we!) are no stranger to brutality. 

1.9/ How can it end? The end of Russian capacity for aggression will not come from the sanctions, although they will be a fundamental enabler. It will not come from rational calculus - at this point Russia (strategically! and rationally!) is not responsive to rational arguments. 

1.10/ The end will come because the Kremlin will become overwhelmed operationally. In war, decision making is compartmentalized. People in command can process a lot of info and make tons of high quality critical decisions if they can be organized in one domain or framework. 

1.11/ It is the switching from one domain to another that is difficulty and overwhelms the ability of the command to make sound strategic decisions. And we are seeing the early signs that there is an increase in the number of domains that the Kremlin has to attend to: 2,3,4 

2/ So, Kherson. The only regional capital fallen so far. Retaking or contesting it would be a huge symbolic win for Ukraine. The Russian troops will spread the word. 

2.1/ A local online radio reports over night that Ukrainian marines have entered the city. There are small arms firefights, an escalation from just artillery fights yesterday. The city is not taken, but contested. This is consistent with US reports a day or two ago 

2.2/ Outside of Kherson, local communities / hromadas are mostly controlled by Russians. Yet, the resistance in Kherson and elsewhere in Ukraine is operational and institutionalized. It is also covert and decentralized. I guess Ukraine learned from recent conflicts in Iraq etc 

3/Nagorno-Karabakh. This is the region contested by Azerbaijan and Armenia. Russia supports Armenia. There are Russian ""peacekeepers"" in NK. 

3.1/Russian state media is full of the reports that Azerbaijan has just taken control of some areas in Nagorno-Karabakh. The region supported by Russia has declared the martial law. There is a AZ govt read out of the call between Russia and Azarbaijan, where AZ reminds RU that 

3.2/ Nagorno-Karabakh does not exist and it is Azerbaijan territory. Cocky of Azerbaijan! 

(Bonus: Here is a video of Belarussian celebration of its Freedom Day March 25). Not in Belarus as far as I can guess (but I have not been able to verify the video)

It may well be justifiable, given their military situation, or even understandable given some of what has happened to date. Perhaps you or I, having seen MLRS rounds fall on residential areas or having seen our country invaded, would do the same. Furthermore, this sort of thing happens in every single war without exception. That is not a unique occurrence, even though I doubt it’s indicative of the wider Ukrainian stance on prisoners. I also can’t wait for the Russians to cry foul, in what would be a fine, fine piece of whatsboutism.

All of that being said, come on man. Going on Reddit and going “yeah, they deserve it” is kind of fucked up. The fact that it was openly filmed is kind of fucked up.

He said he hoped to obtain a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine through diplomacy.

“If we want to do this, we mustn’t escalate,” he said, “neither with words nor with actions.”

Britain’s government took a similar stance.

“I think that is up to the Russian people,” Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said in a television interview on Sunday, when asked if the British government thought Mr. Putin should go. “The Russian people will decide the faith of Putin and his cronies.”

Tobias Ellwood, a conservative British member of parliament, said Mr. Biden’s comment was unwise. “It’s for the Russian people to draw this (obvious) conclusion,” he wrote on Twitter, “Putin will spin this, dig in and fight harder.”

Mr. Biden’s words risked “turning the war for the defense of Ukraine to a familiar one of American aggression,” Patrick Wintour, the Guardian newspaper’s diplomatic editor, wrote on Sunday, “Any unseating of Russia’s president is that country’s business, not that of the U.S. president.” He called the remarks “a badly needed gift” to a Russian government that is skilled at depicting the United States as an “imperialistic bully.”

Kalin says new global security architecture needed
Ibrahim Kalin, the Turkish presidential spokesperson, has said that there has to be a new security architecture in the world.

“The energy geopolitics need to change after this war. It’s not going to be enough, it will not solve the [energy shortage] problem if we increase oil and gas production. We have to think of different ways to address this issue,” he said, speaking at the Doha Forum.

The senior official added: “We have kept our lines of communication open with Russia and Ukraine. There are a number of areas where we disagree with Russia, such as in Syria and Libya, but I think it is important to note that we have managed to develop a working relationship with Russia.”

“Leadership diplomacy will be key in bringing an end to this war. Ukrainians will need to be supported in order for them to defend themselves. But we also need to keep in mind that we need to talk to Russia. Whatever security concerns Russia had going into this war needs to be heard,” he stressed.

Qatar stresses role of dialogue in Russia-Ukraine war
Qatar Foriegn Ministry spokesperson Majid al-Ansari has said Qatar’s position on Russia-Ukraine war has been crystal clear from the start of the conflict.

“While we value our relationship with the West and we consider ourselves to be in line with the consensus condemning escalation in Ukraine, we believe in dialogue and facilitating the need for dialogue,” he said talking in a session at the Doha Forum.

He added: “It is in our national interest as a country to make sure these kinds of conflicts are not prolonged. It is our duty as a small middle power state to facilitate dialogue. Qatar maintained communication with both parties.”",False,1648373827.0,t3_tpc0qa,t3_tpc0qa,,0,-5,0,-5,0,0,

ee9bbb12ca21dc489536660d1ffe44a6,tpc0qa,i2a6ylt,"**ON FINLAND AND NATO (reposted from yesterday)**

This [interview with a Russian-specializing Finnish ex-intelligence agent](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?) has specific information on this subject (re Finland, NATO, the process of joining thereof).

The entire video is worth watching, but [this link (20:57)(closed captioning available)](https://youtu.be/21vXembyXY8?t=1257s) discusses the status of Finland vis-a-vis NATO.

Paraphrasing:

* In [public discourse (the 'tactical truth')](http://world-information.org/trd/68) Russia considers Finland as officially neutral^[a]
* In private discourse (operational plans), Russia **already** considers Finland as part of NATO.

* In public discourse, Finland considers Finland as independent of NATO and Finland as opposed in principle to Russia since joining the EU in 1995.
* In private discourse, Finland considers itself part of NATO and probably (*wink*) has a **'special relationship' with NATO**^[b] with some security guarantees already in place.

Right after the linked time, he goes on to tell a story about he was indoctrinated in school to reinforce the idea that Finland always stay neutral and he could not publicly state his preference to join NATO but since his retirement he professes this fact.

He also says that in its current state because Russia **already views Finland as a NATO member operationally**, Finland has already assumed nearly **all** the disadvantages of being a NATO member without any of the benefits. So he argues that they should finish (no pun intended) joining the alliance.

[This video (a 1 hour lecture with slides, but worth every bit)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw) was my first introduction to this guy Martii Kari which delves into the core cultural differences which are important in understanding the Russian perspective and their system of operating. (closed captioning available)

I also just noticed [this video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBopkxqR3p8) published today from the same guy.

**tl;dr** Finland is already some percentage of the way to joining NATO through a secret process to avoid exactly the situation Ukraine and Georgia find themselves in: wanting to join but being attacked, in part, to prevent it. The government and intelligence agencies are probably committed to this process, and now that public support is tipping to favor it, it will probably be completed rapidly.

Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

 

The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.

“This Russian political culture makes position of regional authorities unbearable. Putin is sacred, innocent, unaccountable. That's the local authority who's responsible for the quality of life. The life quality is deteriorating because of Putin, but governor will be blamed.”

“Now what they're gonna do? Some are trying to encourage return to subsistence farming. Sounds good, doesn't work. Indeed, in the past Russians survived economic crises via their dachas and private gardens. But that culture is gone. Boomers are the last generation who could do it.”

“Subsistence farming is extremely unproductive. It's also extremely laborious and time consuming. It also requires competences that the youngsters simply lack. In the good economy expensive oil years they never learnt how to garden from their babushka and now won't learn quickly.”

“Russian economic situation is awful. It's a catastrophe which local authorities will be blamed for. What they're gonna do? Stock up. Stock as much as possible. That's already happening. Stavropol doesn't have sugar shortage. Why? They don't allow exporting it to other regions.”

“Russia won't fall because of collective morally justified action. It's cohesion will be broken by its own officials aiming to avoid catastrophe in their own region.

Partition is not the basis for peace.
 Russia would need to unilaterally declare the independence of East Ukraine and then keep troops there to guard it.

Meanwhile arms would continue to flow in from the West. Ukraine would continue the conventional war while stepping up insurgency in the occupied territory. The entire west of the country would become one giant base to funnel men and material into the occupied part of the country.

It is the worst of both worlds for Russia. They would turn Ukraine into their own forever war, committing to the occupation while also failing to accomplish most of their political goals, and also opening themselves up to a maximum hybrid-war from Kyiv. And should they ever decide to leave their rump state, it would probably collapse as quick as the ANA, or more aptly here rhe Saigon goverment.

In fact, looking at all the options Russia has available to it, I think unilateral partition is the least appealing option. Russia either needs to unambiguously win this war (by crushing the Kyiv goverment) or find a quick exit, and partition commits them long-term without actually winning.

> 
> (Reuters) - Ukraine has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross not to open a planned office in Russia's Rostov-on-Don, saying it would legitimise Moscow's ""humanitarian corridors"" and the abduction and forced deportation of Ukranians.
> 
> The head of the ICRC said on Thursday after his talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that agreement between the Russian and Ukrainian armies was needed before civilians could be evacuated properly from war-torn Ukraine.
> 
> Russian media reported that Red Cross chief Peter Maurer asked Russia to facilitate the opening of a Red Cross office in Rostov-on-Don.
> 
> Mykhailo Radutskyi, chairman of public health committee in Ukraine's parliament, appealed to the Red Cross to change its plans.
> 
> ""The Committee calls on the International Committee of the Red Cross that it would not legitimise 'humanitarian corridors' on the territory of the Russian Federation as well as that it would not support the abduction of Ukrainians and its forced deportation,"" Radutskyi said in a statement.
> 
> The ICRC was not immediately available to comment.
> 
> Rostov-on-Don is the largest Russian city on Ukraine's eastern border and administrative capital of the Rostov region, which has been used by Russia for temporary accommodation camps for people transported out of the war zone.
> 
> Russia said last week it had evacuated several hundred thousand people from Ukraine since the start of what it calls is a ""special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its neighbour.
> 
> Ukraine claims that Russia has illegally deported thousands of people since the war started, including about 15,000 civilians from the besieged city of Mariupol.
> 
> Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 4 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the West.

I only heard that Liz Truss said we should only remove sanctions when they withdraw

&#x200B;

Russian oligarchs, banks and businesses could have sanctions against them lifted if Russia's President Vladimir Putin ends his invasion of Ukraine and commits to ""no further aggression"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said.  
  
She told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the threat of ""snapback sanctions"" would be retained if the Russian president did attack again.  
  
The foreign secretary also said that a ""negotiations unit"" had been established in the UK Foreign Office to aid possible peace talks.  
  
Russia has shown signs of possibly scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine, with a senior military official saying on Friday that its efforts were now turning to the eastern Donbas region. However the Western city of Lviv, which until now has largely stayed unscathed, came under heavy rocket fire on Saturday.

Also the country's gross domestic product is only a bit more than half as large as western countries such as Britain and France. Due to the international sanctions, it has become even weaker economically than it did before it went to war. Its standard of living is sustained by large imports of manufactured goods, mostly paid for via exports of oil and natural gas. This leaves Russia’s economy highly vulnerable to sanctions that might disrupt this trade.

Ukraine isn't going to lose the willingness any time soon, because Putin just killed their neighbors and destroyed their houses. They are not going to lose their ability because the west will keep supplying them with powerful weapons and the intelligence to counter effectively. Ultimately Ukraine will be able to take the fight to Donbas and Crimea, even.

Russia will gradually lose the ability to fight via sanctions and sufficient battlefield losses but that will take quite some time. They are already losing the willingness to fight via reduced morale. I suspect the only thing that will change the willingness at a high level is regime change in Russia. The world needs someone other than Putin who recognizes and accepts Ukraine's sovereignty, particularly over Crimea and Donbas. The international community recognizes Ukraine's independence and sovereignty over these regions.

Consequently I see this war either dragging on or escalating while Putin is in power holding on to Crimea and Donbas. If Putin is replaced, it could end with a peace deal that brokers a viable solution over these regions. If he remains in power and escalates sufficiently in an attempt to cut off Western weapons, that could draw NATO in, and lead to WW3. WW3 would be catastrophic for the world and the end of Russia.

""Officially there should be NO conscripts in the Ukraine. Officially military operations are only performed by contracted, professional solders.

Turns out the various commanders had been lying about how many contracted solders they actually had on the books, and were filling uniforms with conscripts and pocketing the pay difference. Which worked out fine during peace time, and for small operations where they could pick and choose their best troops.

Invading Ukraine required them to suddenly produce a LOT more professional solders than they actually had. Which is why we were started hearing all those stories of conscripts being tricked, threatened, or lied to to get them to sign contracts.

So it's actually WORSE than having an army of conscripts. It's an army of conscripts that the Russian leadership assumed to be professional solders. You don't put a conscript in a tank or APC and treat them like shock troops or expect them to support paratrooper and special forces who have been deep inserted behind enemy lines.

You use conscripts to guard your rear flank, secure your lines of resupply, and occupy cities to limit civil unrest.

Beyond just being sweet, sugar is also calorically dense and makes unpalatable food more palatable, both useful properties if you grew up in austere times.

5ce0ecd133c12c51e321683e0e1866c1,tpc0qa,i2bxl6i,"The Guardian article only touches on the political complexity of India's relationship with Russia.

1. For a start, the whole situation must be viewed in the context that India perceives a very great risk from China. China has claimed the Indian Northern state of Himachal Pradesh as 'Chinese'. India has regular border skirmishes with China. The situation is volatile and India fears Chinese expansionism. They have seen the West stand by while China has swallowed up Tibet. 

What does this have to do with Russia?

2. Since independence India has relied on Russian armaments. Mig fighters, Russian tanks and assault weapons, etc to defend itself.

They have fought two major wars with Pakistan with these weapons. Pakistan has been armed by the USA and the west.

In a wider political context, the US has aligned with Pakistan and India has relied greatly on Russia for International geopolitical support during the polarised cold war era.

If those two points make India's position as a Russian ally seem clear cut and unambiguous,  there is a more complex factor.

3. India is now closer politically to the USA as it has ever been. Although Indian national politics are driven by local state wide small minded politicians, the real power brokers in India are the super rich tycoons. The Ambanis and Tatas, who are the Bezos, Gates, Koch  types in terms of wealth and power. They want India to be a big part of the Western global markets so there is a strong push from these quarters to integrate India into Western liberalism.

Add in the huge Indian middle class who travel, study and live in the West and the huge Indian diaspora and you have a very strong affinity with the US and Europe.

Russia was the 'old girlfriend', the best India could get. Now the West is an attainable relationship. The flirting has begun.

So, India's ties with Russia are historical and somewhat reluctant.

This Ukraine crisis is an opportunity for both the US and India to forge closer ties. But, that will require the US to give some guarantees about stopping supporting Pakistan, giving protectionism against China and assuring armament supplies which Russia currently provides.

It seems to suggest we (NATO, whatever) could do something in Ukraine as long as Russia itself isn't threatened.  More than likely, though, the non-involvement status quo will remain with escalating support for Ukraine, sanctions for Russia.  Fuel seems to be the big thing looming.  I expect fuel, electricity, infrastructure, anti-air and something to intercept cruise missiles at some point.  Russia is throwing millions at Ukraine, i'm sure the west doesn't mind shooting it down.

**Note**, however, it's a dangerous offer Biden has made. That particular sound bite is tricky to use for propaganda internally in Russia.

There is more nuance to these types of crimes than people give it credit for. They are still crimes don't get me wrong, and they should be held accountable, but people should take a second to think about what these people are *surviving* through before making half hearted opinions about many of the atrocities that most of us could never imagine doing.

d2a917871d23fb8081cdaf0f7f66f24b,tpc0qa,i2awgi6,"There are 2 military groups in Russia: Conscript soldiers and ""Contract"" soldiers. The Contract soldiers are the professionals, having signed a contract for X years of service similar to any other volunteer military force. The Conscripts are civilians required to perform 1-2 years of military service and training within Russia and are not supposed to be sent outside of Russia. A lot of them were coerced into deals where their (poorly paid) conscription service would be shortened if they agreed to join this ""special military operation"" to provide basic support services to the professional military forces - patrolling rearguard areas, running supply lines etc. They didn't expect to be fighting on the front lines of this war.

The contract soldiers are your elite military units - paratroopers, Spetsnaz, elite armor units, pilots etc. These units were supposed to spearhead the invasion with conscript forces accompanying them to mop up any resistance the professionals left behind. The VDV (elite paratrooper unit) for example was supposed to drop into Hostomel airport, then a force of armor and conscripts was expected to link up with them on the ground with only light resistance anticipated between Belarus and Kyiv.

Instead, the Ukrainian army ground the conscript forces to a screeching halt just a few miles past the Ukrainian border, leaving many elite units much too far behind enemy lines beyond their supporting backup forces. This has resulted in heavy losses for the isolated professionals who are being ambushed and destroyed while the conscripts are stuck trying to make headway without proper logistics and equipment through fierce resistance.

Because these conscripts weren't properly trained to fight and weren't even supposed to be near the front, they are surrendering and losing ground to the Ukrainian forces which often have previous combat experience thanks to the past 8 years of civil war in the Donbass region. This is leading some people to the mistaken belief that Russia didn't send their best soldiers and equipment when in reality it's that all of those professional forces have been either destroyed or forced to escape back behind the Russian lines where they find themselves no longer combat capable.",False,1648380770.0,t3_tpc0qa,t1_i2auc04,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

The CIA did some crazy shit, spinning up a bunch of fake companies, hiring Howard Hughes to build an enormous ship with what looked like an oil derrick on it.  The ship had a giant hook that would go down the 3 mile depths, grab the russian submarine, bring it up into the belly of the ship, and then bring it back to the US.  This happens to be where the term ""Glomar response"" originated (""I can neither confirm nor deny"").  They did all this while operating under false pretenses to avoid suspicion - the fake company said they were looking for minerals on the ocean floor.  They even did a whole song and dance in the media about their findings just to give it more credence.  Here's an article that goes into a little more detail:

He's not wrong, but that doesn't include them leaving in exchange for release from sanctions.  However, if Russia packs up and fucks off from everywhere else, the world may just drop the sanctions (after a short delay, no doubt) and that'll be that.

What I imagine will happen is that Russia will try varying sizes of ""footprint"" in Ukraine until it finds one palatable to both Ukraine and the world lifting sanctions.  Originally it was overrun everything but that fell through.  Now they'll try this strange ""split"" where they control Luhansk, Donetsk and a land bridge to Crimea.

The reason that the US keeps wanting to can the A-10 is that it's a sitting duck for anti air. Use of any ground attack aircraft without heavy losses though, requires significant control of the air.

The way your ground attack aircraft survive to fight effectively against supply or armour columns is that you neutralise air defences first. That means fighters flying air superiority sorties and fighter-bombers, faster than your full-fat ground attack aircraft, flying AA suppression (SEAD) missions to take out SAM sites and anti air guns.

The fact is, Russian pilots are flying older ground attack aircraft like their Su-25s, using low and slow tactics because they're out of guided munitions, and whilst that puts them out of SAM targeting, it means they're an easy target for MANPADS (which they won't see) or even an old school autocannon like the ZU-23, which gives no lock tone unlike a missile.

I don’t think people who think like this really understand just how things work. Russia, or more specifically, Putin, have shown they have no trouble killing people. They have a history of conscripting people who say bad things about the government. The list goes on and on. So it amazes me that people think the encounter would go like:

Putin - Push the button. Launch the nukes. 

Generals - No. 

Putin - (throws hands up in the air) Oh, ya got me. I guess I’ll go home then. 

No sir, it would not go like that. First, Putin didn’t surround himself with people who can think for themselves. If he did, we wouldn’t be in this situation now. Secondly, the conversation would go more like this:

Putin - Push the button. Launch the nukes. 

Generals - Boss, I’m not so sure….

Putin - Push the button and you and your family will have a spot in the bunker. Don’t push the button and your entire family will be tortured and killed. Your wife. Your kids. Your parents. Your siblings. Everyone. Will. Die. A. Slow. And. Painful. Death. So, comrades, what are you going to do?

Generals - Umm, we’re gonna push that button, boss!

> In November 2007, Kasparov and other protesters were detained by police at an Other Russia rally in Moscow, which drew 3,000 demonstrators to protest election rigging. Following an attempt by about 100 protesters to march through police lines to the electoral commission, which had barred Other Russia candidates from parliamentary elections, arrests were made. The Russian authorities stated a rally had been approved but not any marches, resulting in several detained demonstrators.[113] He was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and organizing an unauthorized protest and given a jail sentence of five days. Kasparov appealed the charges, citing that he had been following orders given by the police, although it was denied. He was released from jail on 29 November.[114] Putin criticized Kasparov at the rally for his use of English when speaking rather than Russian.[115]

>**In December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a meeting hall where at least 500 of his supporters could assemble. With the deadline expiring on that date, he explained it was impossible for him to run. Russian election laws required sufficient meeting hall space for assembling supporters.** Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to deter anyone from renting a hall for the gathering and said that the electoral commission had rejected a proposal that would have allowed for smaller gathering sizes rather than one large gathering at a meeting hall.",False,1648395613.0,t3_tpc0qa,t1_i2bmu5u,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The cost of the build is estimated to be over 100 billion rubles (US$956 million) at 2022 prices. The complex first came to public attention in 2010 after whistleblower Sergei Kolesnikov published an open letter to Russian president Dmitry Medvedev exposing the construction of the palace. Kolesnikov also stated that the undertaking was run by Nikolai Shamalov who was acting on behalf of Vladimir Putin.

But they seem to be pushing closer to Nova Kakhova, which is very strategic. If they get that city they can easily cut off the northern troops near Kryvyi Rih (about 2-3 divisions) and also open up the opportunity to encircle Kherson from the other side of the river.

It will be hard to take completely though, as it's mainly on the east side of the river and if Russia blows the bridge it'll have a natural moat. Kherson is mostly on the west side though, so if Ukraine manages to cut off and take out those three divisions to the north, they'll have two extra divisions to use against Kherson, and once the east side (basically the whole city) is taken, it'll be really easy to defend.

But it all depends on the bridges. The Ukrainian army will need to ford the river in order to launch proper assaults against the Russians. Crossing the bridges is out of the question. It may be extremely difficult to move past the river once they get to the cities, but if they hold them securely they could move troops around through Zappizhzhia and push that front down to Mariupol and Melitopol.",False,1648356034.0,t3_tpc0qa,t1_i29zirw,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Implicitly, in context, the one 'war crime' is three captured Russian artillery soldiers *allegedly* being shot in the leg by a small group of Ukrainian soldiers.

The other is-- literally everything the Russians have been doing since they invaded, not only in 2022 but since 2014.

Including but not limited to shelling civilians -- like those three were apparently doing -- and invading a nation without acknowledging it as a war, so that their own soldiers -- like those three -- aren't protected by the Geneva Convention.",False,1648389176.0,t3_tpc0qa,t1_i2b9eb9,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

bdab3f5c6e8792b0837b2e897f10d6e7,tpc0qa,i2do1f9,"To chip in…

- an economy is a web of connections. A single unit of imported goods employs a shipper, an importer, possibly a wholesaler, a retailer, and a consumer. Taxes over various kinds can be implemented at each step. If the consumer cannot get the goods they want, all those people are impacted. In the opposite direction, the same is true. In both cases, money (and thereby taxes) are lost. 

- stores that sell embargoed goods have no product. They make no money. Their employees either drain the company funds or get laid off, meaning they cost the country more. 

- companies that make things (farms, factories, etc) have fewer employees when those employees are drafted or called up for service. They need to be replaced, but that required training. So there’s a loss of time and man-hours any time a group is called up

-  any products that get made are intended for sale. If there’s no market, those products take funds to store. Also, to make more, you count on sakes from group A to fund buying supplies for group C while B is being produced. If A doesn’t sell, not only is there no reason to start C once B is finished, but finishing B means more waste. Perishables are worse, and possibly just become waste without recoup. If the market doesn’t open itself up, those companies go under too. 

- if your company is in the importing business and those imports are suddenly embargoed, you either find new goods to import/export, or you start sucking up the cost. Every leg of a journey that a ship/trailer/rail car is empty is cost in maintenance and lost opportunity to its owner. If you have contracts for certain goods that you can’t meet, or have contracted space you can’t use, you suck costs. 

- if all this means is that there’s less in taxes, that still matters. Less taxes means less ability for the government to spend that money on more supplies for a war

- soldiers cost money too. Not just in time and training, but salary. The more troops you call up, the more you owe them in wages… or they are out of the web. Some nations offer higher wages for combat pay. Some offer more for active duty vs reserve. Some offer pensions for their families if they die. Every dead soldier is a waste of time and money. Every day you are engaged in active combat costs money. 

- bullets cost money that you can’t recoup. Explosives more so. Every rocket fired costs it’s price to develop the tech, to obtain its raw materials, to manufacture parts, to assemble, to train soldiers in its use, to store and maintain, and to transport to the site of use.

There are a lot of Ukrainians in Kazakhstan apparently because they were moved around to keep them from organizing any form of resistance, a common Stalin technique.

We don't really know how many in total died because Stalin also killed the census takers so that nobody ever knew how many people were transported and killed. Obviously a ton of them starved too, I think it was something around 1000 per day would drop dead in the streets after they took away all the food and redistributed it to other places in the Soviet Union.

Touch grass and grow up, you terminally online person. Nothing anyone comments here means anything.

In summation, immigration is never full flow at the start. A few brave individuals take a chance, they bring their family and settle for a few years, and then slowly the snowball starts rolling. It's only in one, two, or three decades that we'd see large imitation numbers.

Secondly, did your parents build you a house, plan for your schooling and jobs before you were born? No. Markets in infrastructure like houses, commercial activity, supermarkets, are planned without Soviet style top down planning.

The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's man-made nature and alleged intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement.

On 8 January 2020, the Boeing 737-800 operating the route was shot down shortly after takeoff from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). All 176 passengers and crew were killed. The shootdown occurred during the 2019–2022 Persian Gulf crisis, five days after the United States assassinated IRGC Major General Qasem Soleimani and hours after Iran retaliated by launching ballistic missiles against U.S. bases in Iraq.

And now that Russia, as you say, threw a grenade into the world, and hot conflict has broken out again on mainland Europe, the world has entered another time in which having a strong military has unfortunately become a thing of necessity.

There are two types of rights, positive rights (I have a right to do such) and negative rights (you have no right to coerce me to stop doing such).

A right to immigrate seems to fall into the second group.

The paper I linked to has a good overview of arguments for and against the right to immigrate. One of the arguments is an ethical dilemma called Starving Marvin:

""Marvin is in danger of starvation. Fortunately, he can walk to a market and buy bread there, which will preserve his life… My daughter, however, also plans to go to the market, slightly later in the day, to buy some of this same bread. This bread is often in short supply, so that the vendor may run out after Marvin’s purchase. My daughter could buy more expensive bread, but she would prefer not to. Knowing all this, I fear that if Marvin is allowed to go to the market, my daughter will be forced to pay a slightly higher
price for bread than she would like. To prevent this from happening, I accost Marvin on the road and physically restrain him from traveling to the market. Is my action permissible?

Suppose I claim that my harmful coercion of Marvin does not violate his rights, because it is necessary to protect my daughter from economic disadvantage. Certainly this defense falls flat. A person’s right to be free from harmful coercion is not so easily swept aside. Likewise for the suggestion that my action, though a rights violation, is justified because my daughter’s interest in saving money outweighs Marvin’s rights. No one would accept such feeble justifications.

Yet this seems analogous to the common economic argument for immigration restriction. The claim seems to be that we are justified in forcibly preventing individuals–many of whom are seeking escape from dire economic distress–from entering the American labor market, because American workers would suffer economic disadvantage through price competition. No one claims that American workers would be disadvantaged to anything like the degree that potential immigrants are disadvantaged by being forced to live in the Third World. Nevertheless, the prospect of a modest lowering of American wages and narrowing of employment opportunities is taken to either suspend or outweigh the rights of Third World inhabitants.""",False,1648379830.0,t3_tpc0qa,t1_i2aub7u,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

This was quickly followed by the White House saying Biden wasn't calling for regime change, but was instead making a point about Putin not being allowed to exercise power over his neighbours.  
  
This was clearly an attempt at rolling back - the concern is that this is going to put more pressure on Putin and make him more uneasy.  
  
Given that he is the head of a country that is struggling militarily, and is in control of a nuclear arsenal, the concern on the Americans' part is that they don't want to back Putin into a corner.  
  
Calling out for regime change directly could cause instability and increase unpredictability.  
  
And the last thing you want in these circumstances is unpredictability

Economists have been saying for decades that corporate tax is very inefficient, and also easy to escape, but almost all countries still persist with it. And that's probably the most internationally competitive tax! Tax competition in theory should promote more efficient services, because government's can't just take the easy road when costs rise.

Yeah I was wondering if I was going to be called a Nazi! 😂 It's so difficult to explain simply to people that it's more evil to forbid immigration than it is to remove welfare access to select groups of people.

Another solution economists have proposed is an entry payment. I.e. an adult immigrant can come to Australia, but they have to pay $50k, then they get full access to services. You'd find many companies would offer loans to immigrants for this payment, because an immigrants productivity can increase by up to 10 times just getting off the aeroplane.

I'd sort of consider that if I was in charge of immigration. The money should go to the only people economists find suffer from immigration: high school dropouts. Everyone else will see rising wages, interestingly.

So.. it's a good thing to note that there is definitely housing shortage all across the West. The reason is because politicians are homeowners and are in charge of policy. Also, developers push for laws to limit new competitors. They have written very complicated zoning restrictions that severely reduce housing supply.

Also, unlike the US, Australian industry is very much concentrated in one capital city per state, and nearly every other city is declining. This is only a hope, but it'd be good for large scale immigration to bring populations back to satellite cities.

And-- what we're arguing-- they sure don't even look like they're going to win very many important objectives during the war, despite great losses.

Bogus argument: the US faced resistance and needed to build up a solid logistics chain; hence the advance to Baghdad was slow.  30-40km moves per day are actually pretty damn aggressive for an army, and that's what it took to show up at Baghdad in this time.  Indeed, the US Army almost outran their logistics twice on this advance, requiring panicked reshuffling and support.

Meanwhile, Russia got to Kyiv *quick* using the Chernobyl exclusion zone.

2 ""large"" cities?  Yes, nuclear power plants are valuable things, but their value is tiny compared to the direct costs spent in this operation: let alone the secondary costs.

Access to the Azov sea is a meaningful strategic objective.  If maintained, that's a small win for Russia, but they're still grievously overpaying.

Luhansk and Donetsk were part of Ukraine proper away from Crimea how is a peacekeeping force while Russians retain control less?

As well as population all of them are very very large. Multimillion cities, and by population density. This is pretty much the definition of ""Large"".

Melitopol's population was ~150k.  Kherson's population was ~300k.  Mariupol's population was ~500k.  The population of their metropolitan areas, outside the city, are all under 1M each.
