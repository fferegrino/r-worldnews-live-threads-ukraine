Day 461-464 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were a bit less quiet than usual. Yesterday there was a missile strike aimed at Kharkiv, they targeted some industrial facility with 2 S-300 missiles. Thankfully there were no casualties, and I’m pretty sure there was no fire either, though the explosions were still pretty loud and the missile strike happened in the middle of the day so it was pretty unexpected because they mostly happen at night.

There were more missile launches from Belgorod during the lasts few days, but most of them were aimed at some targets in Kharkiv oblast and some of them ended up being their air defense trying to intercept something. It’s hard to differentiate between a missile strike and air defense because they use the same S-300 systems to do both things. Just an hour ago they even did exactly that, some of the missiles attacked Kharkiv oblast, while others tried to intercept something over Belgorod minutes later.

They also still continue to attack Kyiv almost every day for whatever reason. It doesn’t look like there will be a new attack today, as we usually get notified about them at least 30 minutes to a couple of hours in advance, which hasn’t happened today yet, but I could be wrong and it still might happen later in the night. Thankfully the interception rate over Kyiv seems to be nearing 100% by now, so new missile/drone strikes aren’t nearly as effective as they were before, but it really sucks that even intercepted missiles still cause civilian deaths from falling debris. 

From our own experience there’s basically no point in specifically going to the shelter during missile strikes or shelling, that will only put you in more danger. You just need to have at least 2 walls between yourself and any nearby windows. I’m pretty sure some of the people that, sadly, died yesterday in Kyiv were trying to get to the shelters that ended up being locked, but they should’ve gone to any nearby building instead. If a missile strikes your location directly you are almost certainly not surviving it, so there’s no point in worrying about it. What you need to worry about is the debris/shrapnel and the blast wave, all of which won’t pierce most walls, so you just need to get inside of any building, get yourself away from any windows and wait out the missile strike/shelling.",False,1685747115.0,t3_13y2h30,t3_13y2h30,,0,136,0,136,0,0,

They did not apparently consider that the same pipelines also made Russia dependent on Europe. By contrast, only a single pipeline connects Russia to the whole of China, and it is less valuable to Putin—according to a study conducted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the gas it carries commands prices much lower than the gas Russia pipes to Europe.
>
>To reach world markets, Russia will have to undertake the costly business of compressing its gas into liquid form. A decompression plant like the one swiftly constructed in Wilhelmshaven costs about $500 million. Germany’s three newly built terminals to receive liquid natural gas will cost more than $3 billion. But the outbound terminals that compress the gas cost even more: $10.5 billion is the latest estimate for the next big project on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Russia depended on foreign investment and technology to compete in the liquid-natural-gas market. Under Western sanctions, the flow of both investment and technology to Russia have been cut.
>
>Russia lacks the economic and technological oomph to keep pace with the big competitors in the liquid-gas market, such as the U.S. and Qatar. In April, CNBC reported on a study by gas-industry consultants that projected growth of 50 percent for the liquid-natural-gas market by 2030. The Russian share of that market will, according to the same study, shrink to 5 percent (from about 7 percent), even as the American share rises to 25 percent (from about 20 percent).
>
>If [Russia’s] war in Ukraine continues through the next winter, Europe will have to overcome renewed difficulties. For example, Germany’s nuclear-power plants, which eased the shock last year, went offline forever in April. And this time, the winter might be colder. But gas production by non-Russian producers keeps rising, outpacing demand in the rest of the world. The Chinese economy continues its slow recovery from COVID; India lags as a gas buyer.
>
>Risks are everywhere—but so are possibilities. When this war comes to an end, the lesson will be clear: We have to hasten the planet to a post-fossil-fuel future—not only to preserve our environment but to uphold world peace from aggressors who use oil and gas as weapons. Yet perhaps the most enduring lesson is political. Through the energy shock, Europe discovered a new resource: the power of wisely led cooperation to meet and overcome a common danger.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 June 2023.  


* From the morning of 01 June, partisan groups attacked Russia’s Belgorod region for the second time in ten days.  

* In a complex battlefield situation, what appeared to be uncrewed aerial vehicles also struck Belgorod city (35km inside Russia), while the authorities evacuated civilians from the border town of Shebikino following Ukrainian shelling.  

* The Russia military and interior forces have likely seen quicker success in containing this raid than the previous one.  

* However, according to the Russia MOD’s own press release, it has resorted to deploying the full range of military firepower on its own territory, including attack helicopters, and the TOS-1A heavy thermobaric rocket launcher.  

* Russian commanders now face an acute dilemma of whether to strength defences in Russia’s border regions or reinforce their lines in occupied Ukraine.

>
>For years, ships wanting to hide their whereabouts have resorted to turning off the transponders all large vessels use to signal their location. But the tankers tracked by The Times go beyond this, using cutting-edge spoofing technology to make it appear they’re in one location when they’re really somewhere else.
>
>During at least 13 voyages, the three tankers pretended to be sailing west of Japan. In reality, they were at terminals in Russia and shipping oil to China.
>
>The vessels are part of a so-called dark fleet, a loose term used to describe a hodgepodge array of ships that obscure their locations or identities to avoid oversight from governments and business partners. They have typically been involved in moving oil from Venezuela or Iran — two countries that have also been hit by international sanctions. The latest surge of dark fleet ships began after Russia invaded Ukraine and the West tried to limit Moscow’s oil revenue with sanctions.
>
>“The type of spoofing we are seeing is uncommon and sophisticated,” said David Tannenbaum, a former sanctions compliance officer at the U.S. Treasury, referring to the tankers identified by The Times. “It definitely looks like evasion on all parts.”
>
>To date, it’s been rare to prove the true location of a ship pretending to be somewhere else. But a Times analysis of publicly available shipping data, satellite imagery and social media footage helped clearly establish that the tankers were not where they claimed to be.

However, although it is possible to draft new soldiers into the RF Armed Forces, one cannot simply take and conjure new tanks and other weapons for them. Therefore, Wallace, in contrast to some skeptics, is confident that Ukraine will liberate all its territories, including Crimea. The minister also said that NATO countries need to be prepared for any scenario within the Russian Federation after its defeat.

>
>*The evolving proposals would represent an alternative to the divisive prospect of granting Ukraine’s admission into NATO in the near term*
>
>The Biden administration and its NATO allies are developing plans for securing ongoing military support to Ukraine beyond the country’s current offensive, hoping that long-term security pacts will create a strong deterrent against future Russian aggression and potentially alter the battlefield calculus of President Vladimir Putin.
>
>The evolving proposals represent an alternative to granting Ukraine admission into NATO in the near term, a prospect that has divided member states between those who support Kyiv’s request for immediate entry into the Western military alliance and those who fear it could plunge the bloc into direct conflict with Russia.
>
>Officials from NATO nations, many of whom who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal planning, described proposals for bilateral or multilateral agreements with Ukraine which they characterized as mutual defense pacts or security memorandums along the lines of those that have channeled billions of dollars a year in U.S. military aid to American ally Israel.
>
>Following a months-long effort to secure donations of Western tanks, missiles, air defenses and other equipment that Ukrainian forces need for their planned operation — which some U.S. officials say is already underway — the Biden administration’s focus is now “how do we maintain that strength after the counteroffensive?” a senior U.S. official said.
>
>“What we really want to do is send an unambiguous signal to Putin that regardless of what happens in the West in the coming couple of years, the West will remain supportive of Ukraine’s defense for as long as it takes,” the official said.
>
>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, speaking after talks among NATO foreign ministers in the Norwegian capital on Thursday, said member states strongly supported Ukraine’s eventual inclusion in NATO. But despite intensive advocacy by the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the bloc is not expected to issue a formal membership invitation at a summit of alliance leaders in Vilnius, Lithuania, next month.
>
>Stoltenberg said Ukraine’s supporters must not only continue to provide arms needed to win the war, but also chart a post-conflict course. “When it ends, we need to ensure that we have the frameworks in place to ensure that this is not a pause in the pattern of Russian aggressive actions,” he said.
>
>Officials have said the proposed agreements would involve locking in multiyear commitments to provide funding and weapons and potentially formal promises to come to one another’s aid if attacked. They would also serve to insulate Ukraine from major political shifts in the West or intensified calls to curtail aid, like those some U.S. Republicans have made.
>
>U.S. officials for months have referred to a “porcupine model” that would arm Ukraine and make it capable of repelling Russian attacks, like Israel has attempted to do over decades as a deterrent to surrounding Arab states and Iran. Crucial in Israel’s strategy has been a series of 10-year memorandums with the United States that commit what amounts to more than $3 billion a year in security aid. The most recent memorandum was finalized in 2016.
>
>The United States has provided Ukraine with nearly $40 billion in security aid since the war began.

Where are the privateers? Everyone has a stake in sabotaging these vessels delivering oil traveling with their AIS shut off.

Ukraine benefits because this cuts Russian profits to fund the war. This similarly helps the western nations like the US and NATO to expedite the end of the conflict while not getting directly involved.

Even Russia benefits from this. With a little piracy, they can upsell the oil more. Prigrozhin can use this as a means to wedge himself into control- stealing the oil for himself and having a floating cache to sell or use as leverage as he maneuvers to a position of power.

It’s not just a short sell problem set it’s a capacity over time problem set as well. The confiscation or sinking of a ship not only denies that ships cargo but the supply chain of other ships who have to somehow make up the lost productivity. 

The only ones who lose out are those who depend on Russian oil imports and actively increase them for their personal country’s narrative. Unless you are the US, you lack a fleet with force projection ability to go to the edges of the world to secure your supply line. 

There are nuances, a lot of oil gets commingled in Turkey and Iran for shipment. But it’s an open secret. Russia has a fleet of these ships running from Murmansk, Archangelsk, and St Petersburg to foreign ports directly.

However if they go on ahead just wondering how it all would go down with everything that they have already.  

We know that the Russian defenses have been fortifying their fronts but more specifically the southern side towards Crimea, if Ukraine actually goes ahead without the F16s, how would it look like?  I'm not an expert on combined arms but I see extremely limited movement while mine clearing vehicles pave the way while under constant and focused artillery bombardment.  I see the Russians lighting up these gained entry ways with CAS and reorganization of reserves to compliment forces stationed where the these mine clearing vehicles happen to be just because of how long it takes to clear such obstacles while under duress.  Of course maybe the Ukrainians are going to have mobile SAMs and anti air working triple-time as much as possible and will react to artillery gunning at them with pinpoint accuracy.  (Unfortunately they would be at a disadvantage since mine clearers will pave a predictable path so Russian Artillery will always have a place to fire then relocate unless Ukrainian artillery, UAF, or drones can get to them effectively.)

So order of battle I think would be first they move their forces towards the front as quickly/carefully/stealthily as possible for the element of surprise.  Some forces will go towards other areas for distractions.  Somewhere along the front that isn't the intended CO strike point will have a massive buildup of FAKE blowup inflatables parading as heavy vehicles for added confusion.  

Then comes the CO with faints all along the southern and eastern front as well as into Russia's Belgorod area with the Russian's Freedom Legion in close coordination.  Even air drone attacks to Moscow for added distraction.  Then at the actual area of the CO; special forces that were inserted days ahead will begin causing massive mayhem behind enemy lines, a massive artillery strike will strike defenses, then an innumerable amount of drones so vast with targets to the intended area as well as feints and targets all over Crimea, followed right up with the rest of the UAF (for support and paratroopers to link up with special forces who have marked additional targets).  More drones will come up to continue supporting forces and striking targets.  Then comes the Calvary, mine sweepers working closely with Tanks protecting them,  once no more mines en route Tanks break away to charge into enemy supported by APCs and fast moving infantry trucks.   Everything working in concert as they push to the Sea of Azov.    Then once in position to flank the western side they can immediately threaten Crimea, the Crimean/Russian bridge, and hold Russia at a disadvantageous position as long as they can hold the eastern side of their CO off from Russian's attacking from the east to flank and probably numerous Russian Bombers/Helicopters flying CAS.

What we need is a significant change in foreign policy to bring the global South closer to the West. India and Brazil, at this point, care only for what costs less, and that's going to be a really difficult sell, going head to head with a Chinese economy that doesn't give two poos whether it poisons its populace to get what it wants.

Don't know enough about DeSantis to speculate but he will probably follow popular opinion as well, politicians move with opinions, not moral/idealist beliefs more than anything.  


With that in mind if they follow the Kherson offensive approach they will take back the majority of the south, if not all of it, within a year, this alone should be enough to ensure continued support until final victory. Kherson was a very slow methodical offensive, artillery weakened the front into tank/infantry formations slowly moving forward until the Russian positions were untenable. The current realities are different than what they were during the Kherson operation but given a year it should play out in a similar fashion.

Those who flee can haul ass straight back to ruZZia and witness the chaos and anarchy when the RF continues to fall. Those who surrender probably have it somewhere in their hearts that they know what's happening is wrong... 

What we have seen from a HUGE majority of ruZZian PoW is that they had no idea they would be treated so fairly and most have a sense of deep regret for what they've done. Hold them accountable and re-educate them to be the productive members of a democratic society they've been brainwashed against. Have them learn trade skills like plumbing and construction and they can help rebuild the very country they once sought to destroy. Give them a better life with REAL freedom and maybe, after a while, it will enact some real change in the minds of the few young fascists that decided to flee to ruZZia and fight amongst the rats for the remaining scraps of a country while seeing those who did the right thing and surrender bettering their lives and their (new) country.

Ukrainians have said they are lucky that the Russians are so stupid. Military command is a joke and seems to be primary based on shielding Putin. Another thought is that maybe Russia did have some capabilities similar to the Ukrainians who are surprisingly good at holding of the enemy. It could be and it seems to be that Russia is fighting a kind of war they are very bad at. For sure after WO1 everybody knows that you need to keep moving to avoid trench warfare in which case quantity is simply not a huge factor anymore. Russia failed miserably doing that. Of course it is true that they always lacked quality. But I would not read too much in that. Shorter range, less accuracy as well as less defense against missiles matter less as long as you are moving up while using quantity. In fact NATO has always been afraid of it.

Those people are idiots, and very dangerous ones at that, but they are a vocal faction of the ""Ukraine should just roll over and make peace"" crowd and they are very far left.

Edit: Just to be clear I fully support sending weapons and financial aid to Ukraine and hope they succeed in pushing Russia out from all of their territory, but there is a distinct vocal segment of the far left that thinks Ukraine should make peace and their motivations for thinking that are very different than many on the right that want to stop sending aid to Ukraine.

Yes well, boo hoo. The problem with that position is that it simplifies the situation beyond any reasonable point and in doing so, ignores objective reality.

War is horror, but so is living under an oppressive regime. There are simply no good choices for Ukraine here. Millions of Ukrainians live in occupied territory, and if they are not freed they can expect their culture and identity stamped out, any perceived non-compliance met with abject violence including rape and torture, if it doesn't happen at random. Is the civilized world supposed to abandon those people - and in doing so embolden autocratic regimes and eliciting further conflict and suffering across the globe? 

In the light of the current situation, pacifism is the equivalent of sticking your fingers in your ears and humming really loud. It's rejection of reality and of facts. It's a moral abandonment of common human principles, fueled by simplistic reasoning and wishful thinking.

We don't have to take such a position seriously, and we *certainly* should criticize them and point out how their inaction is absolutely helping the aggressor.

Meanwhile, focusing on the epidemiology of the pathogen, it is important to bear in mind that the transition from a pandemic to future endemic existence of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be long and erratic, rather than a short and distinct switch, and that endemic SARS-CoV-2 is by far not a synonym for safe infections, mild COVID-19 or a low population mortality and morbidity burden.”

That's not quite accurate. Strangely enough, the US has consistently held the opposite view. (but they also hold the view that they will destroy anyone doing it, so there's that...)

The United States holds that privateering is legal and refused to sign the treaty in 1856 and in subsequent treaties and agreements. At the Hague conference in 1907, the US stated: 
>“The United States has not renounced the right to resort to privateering.”


There's a long and complex history behind it, and the arguments are nuanced.

It also depends greatly on what variant and Block of F-16s they get, too. They're not going to get the shiny new F-16V Block 70/72 variants, they're not going to get F-16E Block 60s, and I doubt they'll even get F-16C Block 50/52s. What they're most likely to get, at least initially, is something like the Netherlands' F-16AMs. Decent jets with the Mid-Life Upgrade, but high-hours and equivalent to early F-16Cs at best. 

Maybe down the road they'll get better versions, but history has shown us first Ukraine gets the low-end stuff before the better stuff.

They have more or less exhausted their ""current"" potential (I am not saying they still cannot achieve some victories but complete takeover of Ukraine is no longer a viable option).

To push further is a problem however because going that route is irreversible. Once you start converting car factories to produce tanks, force workers to work dual shifts, redirect clothing factories to instead make military uniforms and effectively stop exports to focus on focus on current events you are living on borrowed time and are sacrificing your country's future to have a shot now. I am honestly not sure if Russian leadership sees this as worth it considering all the risks it carries (arming a million unhappy citizens may unironically cause them to go to a safer direction of Moscow than into Ukraine's meat grinder).

It's also uncertain to what degree Russians even could utilize such maneuver. That's the thing really - even if they went ""all in"" it still is not that great. They were sitting on one of the largest natural resources deposits and with 150 million people population barely exceeded Spain's GDP. It's not USSR. It's just one country. They can dish out 2000 T34s in a year probably if they really wanted to but that's countered by 2000 NLAWS/Javelins. They most certainly cannot produce 2000 T90s and certainly not T14s.

They still can do a lot of harm and war is definitely not decided yet. That much I agree with. But it's **very** unlikely that Russia can do much more than it's currently doing. Unironically their best moves may be either asking China to help or getting USA to reelect Trump in 2024. Both could indeed be a major factor. But if it keeps as is (NATO steadily increasing level of weaponry sent to Ukraine while Russia is limited to what it produces on it's own/buys from Iran/North Korea) then while this war will still go on for a while and consume hundreds of thousand lives... Russia can't really achieve a victory under that scenario. To break this kind of stalemate they would need something huge to occur on a scale of dropping a nuke on Kiev and managing to paralyze Ukrainian's command chain. Catch is that escalating to this gets you a real NATO response and not just us sending some older and newer equipment so even that sort of a move might easily backfire in the long run.",False,1685746902.0,t3_13y2h30,t1_jmo13wc,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

It'll also be beneficial because right now they're jerry-rigging the MiG-29 and SU-24 to be able to fire weapons like the AGM-88 HARM and the Storm Shadow. F-16s will allow them to natively fire those weapons.

But much of the NATO doctrine is also predicated on air superiority, which Ukraine does not and will not have. Most of the precision munitions they could provide are still less than 100 miles in range at best. Meaning F-16s would still need to contend with Russian air defenses. Things like the Storm Shadow are great, but they have longer ranges and can be fired from safer locations. But those are also more expensive and less plentiful.
