Day 190 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was some shelling, and then a lot of missiles flying at us, multiple times as well. First there was a missile strike at 9pm, they fired 4 S-300 missiles at the city, we don’t know where they landed exactly, but it was in a residential district. Then about 30 minutes later there was some shelling, apparently they were shelling Saltivka yet again.

After that there was *another missile strike,* this time at midnight. There were 3 missiles in total; the first missile landed somewhere very close to us. The explosion sound was incredibly loud here, the missile probably landed within 2-3km from us. Then the second missile landed somewhere farther away, but still in the city, it was nowhere near as loud as the first one. The last missile landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, and we don’t know what was hit. None of the missiles started a fire, at least not a big one; otherwise we would have seen it almost immediately.

Then, to our big surprise, there was a *third missile strike* in one day, they never fired missiles three times in one day before, so we weren’t expecting that. But it was a pretty weird missile strike, people from our side of the border saw 2 missiles launching from Belgorod on the horizon at 2:35am, but then nothing happened after, no explosions were reported anywhere, and there was no sound in Kharkiv. Some people speculate that those were AA missiles, but we can’t be sure, after all S-300 is an “AA” missile system, but they are using it as an MLRS to destroy our cities.

Aviation carried out **18 strikes** on command and support posts, warehouses with ammunition, fuel and lubricants, and logistics and transport facilities of the Russians.


**Ground forces:**

> ""Missile and artillery units worked out a number of fire missions.  They hit **nine command posts, two ferry crossings, two drone control points**—at their anti-aircraft defense, and at enemy gatherings.  Fire control over the Antonivsky, Kakhovsky, and Darivsky bridges continues."" 


**Enemy Losses:**

It was established that as a result of the combat day, the enemy forces decreased by:

- 102 soldiers

- six tanks

- *Msta-B* howitzer

- *Grad* rocket salvo fire system

- mobile 120-mm mortar

- eight units of armored vehicles

In addition, **five ammunition warehouses** were destroyed in the Bashtan, Beryslav and Kherson districts. The drone control center in the Pravdyny area, and the ferry crossing near Kozatsky were hit.

We will remind, on August 31, in the eastern direction, anti-aircraft missile units of the Air Force destroyed an enemy helicopter (presumably a Ka-52) of the Russian occupiers. In addition, two UAVs of operational-tactical level were destroyed.

No ‘quick wins’ in Kherson, Zelenskiy adviser says

Ukraine’s counteroffensive to reclaim Kherson has not stalled or failed, a senior adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said.

Oleksiy Arestovych reiterated the offensive was still very much underway in a video messaged posted to Telegram early on Thursday morning.

“The fact that we have not taken Kherson yet does not mean that the operation in the south has stalled or failed. It is carried out in a planned manner. We destroy enemy logistics, air defence systems, fuel and ammunition depots.
… There will be no quick wins. Initially, a strategy was taken to systematically grind Putin’s army.

It is long, so there is a lot of work to be done.”

Ukraine’s armed forces struck strategic bridges in the southern Kherson region to isolate Russian troops located on the right bank of the Dnieper, Arestovych added.

Ukraine’s defence ministry said the Kakhovsky and Daryiv bridges, used by Russia to transport equipment and ammunition to the region, were “disabled” in an update posted to Telegram early on Thursday.",False,1662008785.0,t3_x2xpsa,t3_x2xpsa,,0,72,0,72,0,0,

- Over 30-31 August 2022, Ukrainian Armed Forces continued offensive operations in southern Ukraine, supported by intensive long-range strikes against Russian command and logistics locations across the occupied zone.

- Ukraine's Ministry of Defence also released video footage of Ukrainian aircraft operating high speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs). Russian has previously claimed that it has recovered fragments of these types of weapons, which are designed to locate and destroy radars.

- Russia prioritises strong ground-based air defences - the radar coverage which enables this is a critical capability in its Ukraine operation.

Definitely don't do this at every major pro Russian telegram page, with multiple alternative accounts, VPNs and differing accounts across the entire front line. This may confuse and ultimately make it harder or impossible to collect genuine info this way. Thus hurting the Russian war effort.

I’m also equally amazed how foolish Russia is being. Surely they realise they are sitting on a losing hand in Kherson.

\- We've collected 126 items total, including 15 items that I originally purchased to start things off. That's a total of $4,339.37 of monetary value so far!

\- The first shipment is in transit from Carson to LA but we're expecting it will begin its trip to Ukraine in a day or so. After that, based on our experience with a previous shipment, it might take about 2 weeks.

\- We're almost ready to send the second shipment. That will be either later today or tomorrow.

Remember that name when you think of the Kherson Offensive. 

Way back in march I said this:

> All focus is on Kyiv, yet the Kherson Front is so much more interesting.
> 
> Many wars have been lost because while the main fighting was stalemated at one place, smaller actions broke through elsewhere. Phouc long that led to the 1975 spring offensive that led to fall of saigon, and the Western theater of the American civil war both spring to mind.
> 
> I've been watching Kherson like a hawk.

[Phouc Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ph%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_Long) and the later [1975 spring offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_spring_offensive) is by far the best comparison for what is happening in Ukraine's south. 

North Vietnam's PAVN was less well equipped like Ukraine, but was very well led, with high morale, and highly dedicated troops that have adapted to the war like Ukraine. South Vietnam's ARVN was larger and equipped with better, more advanced US weapons, but suffered from poor logistics, a bad economy, bad leadership, and an incompetent ruler who fired generals left and right, and micromanaged his leaders while demanding full control. 

Sound familiar. 

Recently, a Ukrainian military official stated that Ukraine has never fought a major offensive/counter attack. Interestingly enough, this fits with Phouc Long even more. North Vietnam was unsure whether they could lead an effective and major offense in the south. The last time they tried this, in 1968 with Tet was a tactical defeat. Note, I am very aware Tet was a major strategic and propaganda victory, however it was a severe defeat on the ground. 

North Vietnam needed a place to test whether it could launch, sustain and maintain an offensive in the south. it chose a minor, but strategic location in south vietnam called Phouc Long, that was far, far away from the main front near Hue. The Battle would take nearly a month, but in the end North Vietnam would be successful. 

Ukraine has spent the last 6 months training, preparing, and organizing 3 mobilization waves into an army. They have brought in tons of new weapons, equipment and so on. However, they are unsure how capable their new recruits are and how well they have integrated these weapons into their armed forces. They need a place to test these new weapons and ""blood"" their new army. Ukraine needs to know how an offensive would work and shake out their forces, they need to test their new weapons, and see how these things all work together. Kherson is the place to do that. 

I fully expect that Kherson is Ukraine's Phouc Long. A way to truly test how effective Russia's army is against a major offense and how well the newly organized Ukrainian military can handle an offensive. If the Ukrainian army is successful in Kherson over the next month, I fully expect an operational pause, similar to the one between Phouc Long and [Ban Me Thout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ban_Me_Thuot).

So let's do some napkin math.

Bulk ship capacity varies, but 22 to 35 thousand tons is pretty common. If those ships were reasonably full, say 25 thousand tons on average, that's .2 million tons in one convoy. Not bad.

The trip to Istanbul is a bit less than two days. A ship going back and forth is four days to travel, plus a couple days on either end to load/unload. Round trip about a week. Say a ship was contracted for this route, with some downtime for maintenance factored in, and makes 50 trips a year. At 25 thousand tons per trip that's 1.25 million tons. At 40 trips it's a million tons even. Decent for a single ship.

Looking at the other way, Ukraine used to ship 4 to 5 million tons per month. With this route it would take 10 ships to move 1 million tons. 50 ships making 200 trips per month for five million tons. 200 trips means two arrivals per day at each of the three Black Seas ports. Busy, but that seems doable.

Caveats: I'm not in the shipping industry, just doing rough calculations here. This assumes Istanbul can handle the extra traffic and logistics. A significant amount of grain continues to be shipped via rail or through the Danube ports. Ukraine can and will ship to other ports, but those trips can take weeks. 

Ukraine has a millions of tons of grain stored up and needs to ship quickly. What they're doing with convoys to Istanbul makes a lot of sense.",1662064552.0,1662064300.0,t3_x2xpsa,t3_x2xpsa,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

So clearly CAD and the like aren't that big of a difference in aircraft design with the DOD. I won't go from first flight to production because the F-35 had to develop three variants and that caused an extended prototype to production time line.

""Given its vast energy reserves, Russia appears to be Europe's natural energy supplier. In contrast to the politically unstable Middle East, where a large part of the energy reserves are concentrated, Russia appears to be a stable and reliable trading partner. The energy strategy adopted by the Russian government in August 2003 can provide information on how energy relations between Russia and Europe will develop. According to this strategy, the share of Russian crude oil in total European imports (i.e. in the enlarged EU of around 30 states) will decrease slightly from 30% to 27% in the period 2000-2020. In the case of natural gas, on the other hand, Russia's share of total European imports is expected to fall from the current level of about 70% to about 30% by 2020. Europe will therefore have to import more natural gas from Africa, the Middle East and the Caspian region in the future. However, Russia will remain the largest single supplier of oil and gas to Europe.

In addition to coal production, Russia's energy strategy gives high priority to the expansion of the nuclear power industry. If Russian plans become reality, Russia could export large amounts of electricity to the West. However, the Russian energy strategy does not envisage an ""energy turnaround"" toward renewable energies, as is being discussed in Europe. It is doubtful whether it will be possible to increase the use of coal while reducing the use of natural gas. It is therefore possible that the energy strategy's savings and export targets for natural gas will not be achieved. In that case, however, Russia's contribution to Europe's future energy supply would have to be estimated lower than it is according to the present plans, which would make the question of alternative supplies all the more urgent.""

It's not very likely that russian spies had an significant influence on german energy politics. Making european economies dependant on each other after the second world war brought europe a unprecedented time of peace and prosperity. There was constant war in europe for literal millennias.

It's far more likely that the governments under Schröder and Merkel tried to apply the same logic of mutual dependence to russia. After all on paper russia was and probably still is way more dependet on europe than the other way around. What they didn't take into account is that russia is a totalitarian regime and Putin is way more afraid of a democratic revolution than he is of the economic prosperaty of his citizens.

I don't think anyone would be against deporting Russians who come abroad on visas to gloat. The main issue with a lot of these cases of Russians gloating or harassing Ukrainiand abroad is that they are actually citizens of the countries they are in.

There's also nuance in the discussion. I'm totally pro banning tourist visas, but I think work and humanitarian visas are okay.

I wouldn't be surprised if he did especially send people that openly harass in other countries to get support (!) for a visa ban. 

Most of the import subsitution comes from China or Turkey (not from the EU) so he really doesn't care about this part – especially because a good working customs should already confiscate most of it. A visa ban limits where his people can go which is in Putin's interest because he now only has to care about the borders to Georgia and Kazakhstan if he wants to stop some individuals from leaving the country. Next to no Russian qualifies for such thing as a humanitarian visa at the moment and to get asylum (which is rather difficult as well) you have to enter the EU country first. 

If Putin simply orders that no one can leave to the EU anymore he would likely cause a mass panic because anyone would think that other borders are next and a general mobilization could be looming. So the smart way is to let the EU do the work for him because you can use it for propaganda and get what you want without having to face the consequences. Putin is also not dependent on tourist visa for his espionage because you can be sure that he has embassies and local agents in all european countries.

And the brain drain hasn't likely ended yet because in the first wave anyone could go that had no obligations.

It’s also useful bc deductions can be made—We also know from them that so far, the Russians trapped (“blockaded,” the R milbloggers call it) have so far been unwilling to surrender.

Those countries also so happen to buy a lot of Ruzzian weapons.

So if you starve your own weapons clients, why would they still buy from you?

This is one of the reasons, but it gives some perspective on the situation.

They also stole grains from Ukraine, and tried selling said grains themselves, but were not super successful. Ruzzia itself has enough grains, they are an even bigger exporter of grains than Ukraine is, so it's not like they would steal those grains for their own internal needs.

While trying to sell the stolen grains they found it almost impossible, the ships were arrested, it was not a smooth operation.

It was a bigger headache than it was worth, if you look at it from that perspective.

Plus, while they did prevent the sale of grains from Ukraine, it gave them a lot of negative publicity. You would say the war already did that, but a lot of countries that rely on grains from Ukraine also don't really care about the war in Ukraine or have little to offer towards the matter.

By opening that grain corridor they can say ""look, we are so gracious, we don't prevent the free flow of grains, even though it's our enemy that profits from it. We're the good guys.""

Yeah, that went out the window a long time ago, when UA got fighters and other stuff.

Russia no longer has a say in what the west is giving Ukraine. Sure, they'll bitch and moan, is the only thing they can do. 

All the support has overall been a delightful application of *salami tactics* by the west. 
Ukraine hits Crimea? ""So what, it's not the first time, why are you crying now russia?"" Belgorod? The same.

There is zero difference if UA hits russia proper with domestic or foreign missiles.

Probably now using HIMARS and M270 to launch ATACMS would not the be the most effective use for them. While UA softened russian air defenses along the frontline, those further, and in russia are still operational.

The thinking probably goes: give UA what it needs this moment to push the russians, and when they reach the point where ATACMS can be employed with max efect... Tadaaaaa. They get them (if they haven't already).

UA reaches Perekop and needs to hit Crimea constantly?
 Here are the ATACMS.
UA needs to hit the Kerch bridge?
ATACMS
UA pushes the russians to the border, and they continue lobbing missiles?
Believe it or not... ATACMS

Hundreds of US bomber crewmen also landed in the Soviet Union after bombing Japan. They were officially interned for the duration. The Soviets went to great lengths to find flyers who had parachuted into wilderness. Their housing and food were often substandard by US standards, but better than most Red Army officers.  They were put in trains, then trucks, to Tehran, and then flown back to the US. Early on, the NKVD put on charades to make them think they were escaping, or that friends among the guards were smuggling them, and they were sworn to secrecy when they got back to the states. 

US airmen were also interned during WW2 in Switzerland, Portugal, Sweden and Turkey, and some escaped.

ba7112447ab9666116afcc4a13e60576,x2xpsa,impb5o4,"A quick primer. A lot of modern weapon evolution can be summed up as increasing range without losing targeting ability. Old cannons and simple mortars suffer from their first shot being a guess, then they adjust. So inefficient and not much good at hitting fast moving targets. Developing radio meant longer range artillery could shoot at targets it can't see, with a spotter near the target calling in the adjustments. Then came spotters with IR lasers, and artillery shells with limited steering and an aiming system that amounts to Find The Laser Dot. No more guessing, just shoot near the target and the spotter (now in drone form) guides it in.

Ships are a bit trickier because they move a lot. And it's hard to get spotters close without being seen. So basically the attacker has to get a plane just close enough to spot the ships, and then send missiles. And those missiles have to be better at finding targets than just playing Spot The Dot. Like have their own radar, or fancier optics with fancier computers. Expensive.

Finally planes go really damn fast, so shooting them before it's too late requires radar. Like giant spotlights lighting up everything in front of them. This works well when the spotlights are really far away and mobile, but are easy to kill with Spot The Dot missiles because they're, well, spotlights already. Big and bright.

This is why the US is so big on air power. Flying radar has enormous range. A plane at typical altitude for a commercial jet can see the ground for almost 250 miles in all directions. Also this is why hypersonic missiles are more hype than threat to the Navy, they don't really increase the range of threat because the ships still need to be spotted before shooting at them. What's worse, the same features that make hypersonics hard to counter, make them really hard to aim at moving targets.",False,1662061957.0,t3_x2xpsa,t1_immpjlx,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

I’ve got a bunch of gun and freedom loving neighbors who are all about Ukraine fucking the Russians up on their pursuit of “freedom”, and a bunch of liberal neighbors who have been flying the flag and continuing to express support for Ukraine. In a land of political divisions, Ukraine’s fight for their identify and freedom resonates on so many levels with Americans, that Russians will never be able to shut post their way to a position of support in this country.


Excluding a few hardcore tankies and qanonists inspiring how firmly behind Ukraine most of the political spectrum are with this across the anglosphere and Europe.

That consensus has illustrated that the 'self evident' truths the american declaration of independence tries to describe actually are self evident and pretty much universally held by free thinking people whatever their other political beliefs- that governments only derive their consent from the governed, that people have a right to resist attempts to impose unelected rulers on them and defend themselves from tyrants trying to take their  independence away.

Your average american is watching a fledgling democracy fighting its own war of independence, and showing the world, again, that for free people those truths are self evident and worth fighting and dying for. And they are seeing their own country repeat one of the proudest moments in their own history- being the arsenal of democracy again and use their enormous military power and wealth not for any selfish purpose but to support people on the same path to freedom.

For your average person in the UK, Ukraine's struggle echoe the 'finest hour' in their own history, when facing an overwhelmingly powerful totalitarian regime, they chose to fight on, alone, even at the risk of their own extinction, rather than accept the principle that might is right, international borders can be redrawn at will and treaties, commitments and solemn promises mean nothing. When Zelensky spoke to the house of commons it was so incredibly emotional because everyone in that building knows their own history and the terrifying choice Ukraine has had to make-  to not compromise or accept subjugation and to defend their home whatever the cost. 

And you can keep going on- for the French the ideals of their own revolution, arguably the triggering event for modern europe society are obviously present in the ukrainian euromaidan that led to this. And when part time citizen soldiers, civilians and volunteers in Ukraine worked together seamlessly to defend their Republic and stoppedthe largest army in Europe in its tracks, and troops, it was about the clearest illustration possible that the ideals of liberte, egalite, fraternite aren't just an abstract or outdated concept, they are the fundamental reason why liberal democracies are strong.

And for Poland and Eastern Europe it is simply about protecting what they had to struggle for over the last 50 years and recognising the harsh truths the know better than anyone- that 'never again' has to mean 'never again', that freedom is worth dying for and that if they and the world stand by and do nothing whilst their neighbours are crushed they will be next.

1ea2036547303e8737400988889daaf8,x2xpsa,impr9lr,"There is not as much brainwashing done in Russia's school system as you might think. While they might try and instill a sense of pride in Russia and demonize the west the Putin regime instead of trying to instill fervent nationalistic tendencies in the population instead tries to mostly instill apathy. The government mainly seeks to make Russians feel that their votes don't matter, their opinions don't matter and if you don't like it just sit home and shut up. That way there are fewer people involved in the political sphere and it makes people less likely to engage in protests or be dissatisfied when the government promises something that never happens. When you have zero expectations you're less likely to be angry when the government fails to deliver yet again. If you create a bunch of politically energized citizens who feel like they have influence by supporting you they can also turn on you if you do something they don't like. Apathetic people that have had the will to air opinions in public figuratively or literally beaten out of them are much less likely to take to the streets no matter the reason.

This attitude is evident in Putin's reluctance to order full mobilization and send draftees to fight in Ukraine because he knows a large section of the population is apathetic at best to it and does not want to give them a reason to get off their couch and protest. A lack of support for the war is also evident in the constant failure to reach recruiting goals for new soldiers to send to Ukraine and having to offer more and more money to try and lure in volunteers. They have even started to recruit directly from prisons offering amnesty if they go to fight in Ukraine, if they survive of course.

Sure Russian news blares propaganda non stop but that is lapped up by the segment of the population that are hardcore Putin supporters, a large segment of the population simply ignores it and tries to live as best they can. Opinion polls in Russia are the definition of unreliable as only the section of the population that really support Putin will answer, anyone who opposes government talking points will usually take the safest option and simply say nothing. Like people I know who lived through the end of the Soviet era the attitude is ""best not to make trouble for yourself."" That attitude persists today.

I think you underestimate the huge pull of western culture in Russia going all the way back to soviet times. There is this weird dichotomy where the mouthpieces of state media might blame the west for holding Russia back but at the same time much of the population voraciously consume western music, movies, buy western brands and want to travel there. These attitudes are very strong and I would argue that young tech savvy people will have little trouble circumventing them when all it requires is a VPN. Sure a closed internet will increase the number of people unable to consume media from outside Russia but the undercurrent of wanting to listen to that music, watch that movie and wear those clothes is strong enough in Russian culture that more will still go to the effort than you might think.

I don't think there as many brainwashed young people as some think and I am not sure the war and sanctions will result in some huge shift in young people to be hardcore Putin supporters as the Russian school system hasn't really sought to produce that to this point. That could change of course but I would not say the current generation of young adults and children in Russia have been especially indoctrinated with pro Putin and Russian propaganda as producing fervent nationalists hasn't really been the goal to this point.",False,1662068103.0,t3_x2xpsa,t1_imp87nl,,4,2,0,2,0,0,
