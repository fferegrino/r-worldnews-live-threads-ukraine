Now its been a couple weeks since Ukraine's Kherson offensive and the dam wasn't blown except for the bridge part. Im sure there are other false flag claims but I can't think of any more...

A right-wing party originally starting as a centre-right alternative to the CDU/CSU, since 2015 it is considered to be part of the radical right, a subset of the far-right that does not oppose democracy.\[1\]  
Alternative for Germany (German: Alternative für Deutschland, AfD; German pronunciation: \[aːʔɛfˈdeː\] (listen)) is a right-wing populist\[2\] political party in Germany.\[3\] AfD is known for its opposition to the European Union,\[4\] as well as immigration to Germany.\[5\] It is positioned on the radical right, a subset of the far-right, within the family of European political parties.\[6\]  
  
Established in April 2013, AfD narrowly missed the 5% electoral threshold to sit in the Bundestag during the 2013 German federal election. The party won seven seats in the 2014 European Parliament election in Germany as a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists. After securing representation in 14 of the 16 German state parliaments by October 2017, AfD won 94 seats in the 2017 German federal election and became the third largest party in the country as well as the largest opposition party; its lead candidates were co-vice chairman Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the latter having served as the party group leader in the 19th Bundestag. In the 2021 German federal election, AfD dropped to the fifth largest party.  
  
AfD was founded by Gauland, Bernd Lucke, and former members of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) to oppose the policies of the Eurozone as a right-wing and moderately Eurosceptic alternative to the centre-right but pro-European CDU. The party presented itself as an economic liberal,\[7\] soft Eurosceptic, and conservative movement in its early years.\[8\]\[9\]\[10\] AfD has subsequently moved further to the right,\[11\] and expanded its policies under successive leaderships to include opposition to immigration,\[12\]\[13\] Islam,\[14\] and the European Union.\[15\] After 2015, AfD has often been characterized as an anti-Islam,\[16\]\[17\]\[18\] anti-immigration,\[19\] German nationalist,\[20\]\[21\]\[22\] national-conservative,\[23\]\[24\]\[25\] and a Eurosceptic party.\[26\] The AfD is the only party represented in the German Bundestag whose environmental and climate policy is based on the denial of human-caused climate change.\[27\]\[28\]  
  
Several state associations and other Factions of AfD have been linked to or accused of harboring connections with far-right nationalist and proscribed movements, such as PEGIDA, the Neue Rechte and Identitarian movements,\[29\] and of employing historical revisionist and xenophobic rhetoric.\[30\]\[31\]\[32\]\[33\] They have been observed by various state offices for the protection of the constitution since 2018.\[34\] AfD's leadership has denied that the party is racist and has been internally divided on whether to endorse such groups.\[35\] In January 2022 however, party leader Jörg Meuthen resigned his party chairmanship with immediate effect and left the AfD, as according to him the party had developed very far to the right with totalitarian traits and in large parts was no longer based on the free-democratic basic order.\[36\]  
  
In March 2021, most of Germany's major media outlets reported that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) had placed AfD under surveillance as a suspected extremist group.\[37\]\[38\] Shortly after this announcement, surveillance of AfD was blocked by the courts to give equal opportunities among political parties in a key election year.\[39\]\[40\]\[41\] In 2022, it was ruled that the BfV may classify and monitor the entire party as a suspected right-wing extremist. A corresponding lawsuit by the AfD was dismissed, because ""there were sufficient factual indications of anti-constitutional efforts within the AfD"".\[34\]",False,1669244009.0,t3_z2eqsr,t1_ixjjry7,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

The National Rally (French: Rassemblement National, pronounced \[ʁasɑ̃bləmɑ̃ nasjɔnal\]; RN), until 2018 known as the National Front (French: Front National, pronounced \[fʁɔ̃ nasjɔnal\]; FN), is a far-right\[9\]\[14\]\[15\]\[16\]\[17\] political party in France. It is the largest parliamentary opposition group in the National Assembly and the party has seen its candidate reach the second round in the 2002, 2017 and 2022 presidential elections. It is an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity,\[18\] as well as stricter control of illegal immigration. It also advocates for a 'more balanced' and 'independent' French foreign policy by opposing French military intervention in Africa and by distancing France from the American sphere of influence by leaving NATO's integrated command. It has opposed the European Union (EU) and its related organisations. It also supports French economic interventionism and protectionism, and its economic and social policies are often classified as left leaning; it has a zero tolerance approach towards law and order.\[7\] The party has been accused of promoting xenophobia and antisemitism.\[17\]  
  
The party was founded in 1972 to unify the French nationalist movement. Its political views are nationalist, nativist and anti-globalist. Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the party and was its leader until his resignation in 2011. While the party struggled as a marginal force for its first ten years, since 1984 it has been a major force of French nationalism.\[19\] It has put forward a candidate at every presidential election but one since 1974. In 2002, Jean-Marie came second in the first round, but finished a distant second in the runoff to Jacques Chirac.\[20\] His daughter Marine Le Pen was elected to succeed him as party leader in 2012. She temporarily stepped down in 2017 in order to concentrate on her presidential candidacy, but resumed her presidency after the election.\[21\] She headed the party until 2021, when she temporarily resigned again. A year later, Jordan Bardella was elected as her successor.\[22\]  
  
The party has seen a spectacular increase in its popularity and acceptance in French society in recent years. While her father was nicknamed the ""Devil of the Republic"" by mainstream media and sparked outrage for hate speech, including Holocaust denial and Islamophobia, Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of ""de-demonisation"" of the party by softening its image and trying to frame the party as being neither right nor left.\[23\] She endeavoured to extract it from its far-right cultural roots and normalise it by giving it a culture of government, as well as censuring controversial members like her father, who was suspended and then expelled from the party in 2015.\[24\] Following her election as the leader of the party in 2011, the popularity of the FN grew.\[25\] By 2015, the FN had established itself as a major political party in France.\[26\]\[27\]  
  
At the FN congress of 2018, Marine Le Pen proposed renaming the party Rassemblement national (National Rally),\[28\] and this was confirmed by a ballot of party members.\[29\] Formerly strongly Eurosceptic, the National Rally changed policies in 2019, deciding to campaign for a reform of the EU rather than leaving it and to keep the euro as the main currency of France (together with the CFP franc for some collectivities).\[30\] In 2021, Le Pen announced that she wanted to remain in the Schengen Area, citing ""an attachment to the European spirit"", but to reserve free movement to nationals of a European Economic Area country, excluding residents and visitors of another Schengen country.\[31\]\[32\]",False,1669244265.0,t3_z2eqsr,t1_ixjjry7,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

That seems like a pretty narrow view of why a believed strike on Poland got attention. It could have been a spread of the war to a NATO country, which has all sorts of repercussions that even strikes on energy infrastructure in Ukraine doesn't come close to.

Turning off electricity does not remove the house.  There is no reason for tents.  

A good sleeping bag and mattress.  Better to have a pair of light sleeping bags to use as liners inside of the big thick bag.  Jugs of water will prevent the inside temperature from falling much below 0C even in extreme cold.  

>. ...And build time for transformators is like many months or even years....

Why tie what we do to what the Kremlin does or says? An ultimatum would imply that the supply of this equipment, and more, is negotiable. That we, in some way, respect how the criminal Putin and his regime feel about that.

And what if the ultimatum is, do this or that right now, or we *immediately* start supplying these arms? Well, how about we just immediately supply what we are able to? Which is pretty much what we've been doing.

If we say, keep this up and Ukraine gets F-16s, and then it takes a while, due to logistics and training, to supply the F-16s and get them operational, this would be easy to interpret, or spin, as weakness and a failure to follow through on the part of the West.

Bullshit.  Stop attacks on hospitals.  Stop attacks on schools.  Stop attacks on apartment buildings.  Stop attacking Ukraine.  

The electrical infrastructure is nearly the first thing USA bombs in a war. First is air defence and air superiority.  Those comes first because it is part if clearing the way.  Then electricity gets knocked out.  This is also how it should be. (Wars should not be but...)

There is nothing tolerable about killing soldiers.  War is a thing you should oppose.  War should be strongly avoided and ended as quickly as possible.  The problem here is that Russia invaded.  The invasion was wrong.  Attacking electricity is quite reasonable in comparison. 

This is an escalation that Putin will lose horribly.  Russians who are sitting in the dark will be upset.  Ukrainians will be upset too but they will persevere.  It will not be easy for Russia to replace electrical parts while sanctions are in effect.  Vulnerable Russians cannot hop on a train and take refuge in western Europe in January.  Ukraine is getting generators and warm sleeping bags.  

War was never supposed to be fun.  Ukraine has to choose between following through and sacrificing or choose to lose land.  It is better if the sacrifice is comfort rather than the lives of the young.  Watch how quickly Russians will turn against Putin when their comfort is at stake.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and the minority staff of the Senate Finance Committee, “confirms that the NRA, its officers, board members, and donors engaged in a years-long effort to facilitate the U.S.-based activities of **Maria Butina** and Alexander Torshin,” the report states.

>  
>Butina, arrested that July, is now serving time in federal prison for a conspiracy to act as an unregistered foreign agent.

- there's currently less fake news, less disinformation (unsure how the network will defend against that)
- ads are very rare (and there's no ""promoted"" tweets)
- there's no ""algorithm"" trying to promote things: you see what you register to, in order

, 2014
](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/vladimir-putin-wants-to-regain-finland-for-russia-adviser-says-9224273.html)


The more successful democractic neighbors a autocracy has, the harder becomes to the dictator to justify his power.

When you look at Russia european neighbors, you are going to see:

Finland
Estonia
Latvia
Belarus
Ukraine

Finland has a different history from the others. it never was a part of Soviet Union, so it's not a surprise to Russians to see that they are successful.

But the other 4 countries share way more similarities with Russia when it comes to history, heritage etc. 


Estonia and Latvia are only getting more and more successful, and it worries Putin, but they are small countries with small populations (1,3 and 1,8 million habitants)

What worries the Kremlin most are Belarus and Ukraine, two countries with relatively big populations.

Belarus is ruled by a dictator who is at power at 30 years and who is helped by the Kremlin to suppress protests.


And then Ukraine, a relatively fragile democracy where: Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned with dioxin in 2004 as he ran against the pro-Russian candidate for president.

In 2013, the Ukranian president Viktor Yanukovych abruptly ditched its plans to sign a historic pact with the European Union aimed at shifting the country out of the Kremlin's orbit, leading to protests and Yanukovych fleeing to Russia in 2014, while the Kremlin started backing separatists in Donbass and grabbed Crimea.

In 2022 Putin says Ukraine isn't a real country, compares himself to Peter the Great and planned to take over the whole country.

 >A graphite bomb is intended to be a non-lethal weapon used to disable an electrical grid. The bomb works by spreading a dense cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over air-insulated high voltage installations like transformers and power lines, causing short-circuits and subsequent disruption of the electricity supply in an area, a region or even an entire small country. The weapon is sometimes referred to as blackout bomb or as soft bomb because its direct effects are largely confined to the targeted electrical power facility, with minimal risk of immediate collateral damage.

It's more like: they don't want the perception to be that it was a NATO invasion of Ukraine (which justifies Russia's invasion).

It's not clear that there's actual worry there. Russia's making a lot of bluster, but Russia itself is NOT threatened here, only their occupation. It stands to reason that Russia is not likely going to escalate to nukes over Ukraine.

>or they're worried that Russia will just collapse into chaos if Putin loses the war 

Also, very unlikely. We've been down this road before; and yes . . . the USSR did collapse, but they managed to maintain their nuclear forces well enough. (with international help).  

>Instead they're trying to just slowly bleed Russia dry hoping that Putin will eventually accept a ""soft"" defeat 

Well; yes, but then it turns into a waiting game, and running out the clock, and that works to Russia's advantage, because of their terror bombing campaign and infrastructure attacks.

Russia is trying to force Ukraine to capitulate. Ukraine's NOT going to capitulate, and Russia will be kicked out eventually.  The more they destroy, the more expensive it will be to rebuild.  Russia thinks they're going to get away with not paying.  And that's going to be the very hard part of this in the 5-10 year time-frame; after Russia is forced out.

They'll still be firing missiles, and they'll still be refusing to return captives, pay reparations, and they'll still be bitching about sanctions; and Ukraine's allies will start bitching about sanctions too.

So in the short term, anything we can do to end or curtail Russia's terror bombing is going to help this effort in the long-run.

Russia can barely hook up the top of a SRBM to a plane and go ""yup that's hypersonic"" and make it hit...something.  Maybe.  Last time it hit an outhouse.  The US has mass-produced autonomous stealth cruise missiles that fire EMP bursts to disable electronics, and doesn't even tout it as an interesting development.

Russia spent like 15 years building the Armata only to cancel it.  The US has been building on and off versions of essentially the same thing as odd side projects off the Abrams, only for the army to go ""we don't actually care"", like most of their other programs.

Russia can't even keep one small carrier running.  The US has about a dozen.

Russia has something like 11 semi-stealth aircraft, with an RCS equivalent to an F-18.  The US has had stealth aircraft since the 80s, and is introducing the B-21 and XF-37 or whatever drone for the F-35 this year.  F-35s are in mass production and there are over a hundred F-22s out there.

He needn't have worried.  The first firebombing to test his tactics was a night raid on Tokyo.  It killed 250,000 people.  More than both atomic bombings combined.

It created a firestorm, the updrafts from which threw bombers 1,000s of feet in the air.  And when civilians attempted to save themselves by jumping in the rivers, the rivers boiled.

Well that's easy. Since most soviet buildings and Ukraine like Russia likely still use a lot of gas stove. Apartment buildings are designed to have vents since most house have gas burners.

All you have is to connect the chimney to the vents and technically that's all there is to do. Sure the chimney isn't designed for ashes but lets be honest it will work just fine for some time. I've seen videos how in Vorkut (if I'm not mistaken), some people simply replace a window by some plywood with a hole and vent it outside.
