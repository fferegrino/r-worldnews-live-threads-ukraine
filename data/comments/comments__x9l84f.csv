Day 198 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Just as we are getting some amazing news from our forces these days, the shelling is getting proportionally and progressively worse. Today they shelled the center of Kharkiv in the middle of the day, when there’s a ton of people on the streets, it’s a miracle that nobody was killed, but 14 people were injured including 3 children.

They shelled the Naukova Street, particularly in the area around the metro entrance. Before the Covid lockdowns started I was going there daily to my university, and there is always a ton of people around, because there’s a ton of restaurants, pubs, clubs, stores and also a tax office. This is literally *the place* to hit if you want to cause mass civilian casualties. 

From the videos we saw the shells were landing within meters from apartment buildings. I don’t think they managed to damage my university, but there were smoke pillars within about 50-100 meters from it. There are actually 2 universities within 200 meters from each other, but they missed both of them. From our friends we know that they hit the club/bar “Misto”, a kindergarten, a gas station and at least one apartment building in that area, and that was at 2pm, so the streets were full at the time.

Also yesterday they fired 6 missiles at Kharkiv at 1am, one of which blew up immediate after firing in Belgorod as is tradition.  Waking up from an air raid siren, reading about missile launches on your phone and hearing those missiles land within 1 minute never gets old, but in a bad way, it’s just something that is impossible to get used to. 

I’m not sure if they fired any missiles today, but there were some reports of missiles launching from Belgorod and then nothing followed, they will probably fire more missiles in the coming hours. They did shell us a second time at 7:30pm, and this time is sounded very close to us, even the car alarms were going off, so it couldn’t have been too far away. Are they really not concerned about their entire Kharkiv front disintegrating? Why the fuck are they shelling Kharkiv, trying to kill civilians, when their full attention is needed elsewhere?

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 9 September 2022


- Fighting continues in southern, eastern and northern Ukraine. On 08 September 2022, the military of Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour, started routine training exercises to regain territory taken by 'enemy forces' and secure their borders. The exercises are due to last until 14 September 2022.

- The drills will be conducted close to Brest near the Polish border, around the Belarusian capital Minsk and in the north-eastern region of Vitebsk. Although Russia's use of Belarusian territory was instrumental in Russia's failed advance on Kyiv early in the invasion, Belarusian forces have limited offensive capabilities and there is a remote chance that they have deployed forces into Ukraine.

- It is highly unlikely that these exercises are an indication of preparations for direct Belarusian involvement in the Ukraine war.",False,1662718151.0,t3_x9l84f,t3_x9l84f,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

With a flag raising confirmed on the road past Vesele this does suggest Ukraine could be within a couple of Kms from Izium which is supported by rumours

With the one at Yasynuvate it suggests a push all the way to the Oskil with probably control of the P78 road all the way to the river/reservoir

I have left Russia, the place where I lived my whole life, 3 months ago because the country began descending into full insanity. The negative feelings towards Ukrainians have always been there but they were mostly expressed through jokes and kitchen talk; a lot of people had family in Ukraine whom they mostly seen as ""kinda weird and uppity"" but still kept in touch. 

When I think about it now I realize that it was because no one saw Ukraine as a threat or even a serious entity; everyone made fun of Ukraine's often-changing government and loud political activists and thought to themselves ""how does this country even exist, they're so disorganized, they can't do anything"". 

In the last couple years something grim has started happening: the dismissive attitude towards Ukraine and its people started being transformed into full blown hatred. By power of changing information background the people of Russia were encouraged to no longer just think about Ukrainians as silly and unworthy of attention but as evil malevolent beings whose very existence as a nation is an unacceptable threat to Russia and its people. 

The people were explained that Nazism is the essence of Ukrainian culture, that the entire Ukrainian people should be punished for the crime of ""genocide"" against ethnic Russians and that Ukrainian language, culture and heritage need to be exterminated forever to remove the threat against Russian people. It sounded like a big task but the Russians were not to worry for Putin had an answer: Ukraine is a severely corrupt non-functional country and as soon as Russian troops crossed the border the Ukrainian army and government would run away without any resistance and Russia would be free to fulfill its mission. 

Now we've seen the opposite happen: Ukraine has stopped Russian army after it barely managed to take 20% of Ukrainian land with severe casualties and is now rapidly retaking its land. 

I think the most poetic aspect of this war is that Russia, which prided itself on its military might and being the world's second greatest army, took an embarrassing defeat not from another one of the world's major militaries, but from the very country is used to degrade and dismiss and consider ""not a real country"" for such a long time. I don't know yet how everything will end but I like to think that the sheer scale of this embarrassing crushing defeat will prevent any future Russian government from trying anything like this ever again.

That, together with Zaluzhnyi's remark a few days ago about ""showing the war to the russian people"" would mean that beside the devastating impact over the russian military, Ukraine's intent was to provoke a serious impact for the russian public (a la Tet Offensive).

Now, let's say the frontline stabilizes somewhere along the Oskil river or they even push to Svatove and Ukraine consolidates, so no dramatic push to the border yet.

>Russia has deployed helicopters and weapons in the occupied Ukrainian Kherson region in an effort to round up soldiers who had deserted their positions, according to Ukraine.

>The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine wrote in a Facebook update Friday afternoon that ""significant losses and the unwillingness to fight"" were contributing to a deterioration in the ""moral and psychological condition"" of occupying Russian troops. The number of deserters is also increasing, it said.

>""In the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region, in the area of Babenkivka Second settlement, the enemy had to deploy helicopters and weapons to search for fugitives and return them to combat positions,"" the post read. ""In addition, through Kalanchak, in the direction of temporarily occupied Crimea, intensive movement of unarmed Russian soldiers was noted."" Kalanchak is also located in the Kherson region, where a Ukrainian counteroffensive is currently taking place.

Behind the front there is no hard fortifications and hence this is an opportunity I don't think will be found again for Ukraine. The areas they are able to cut off will enable them to capture a lot of equipment and pows. Reminds me of German tactics in ww2 where once the panzer reached the rear of the enemy, one part used to push further in while the other used to roll up the flanks and break the supply to the immediate front resulting in large pow counts and equipment. Captured equipment along with low casualties. The role of deep pentration is to make supply situation at the front untenable and make withdrawal impossible.

Incidentally Russia was trying this at the start of the war but Ukraine had kept its main forces back and had defence in depth instead of static lines so it didn't work as there was no Frontline to break through. Russia being more powerful probably didn't deploy on depth for defence.

One thing also to note is that Russians don't really know where the Frontlines are, so they are vulnerable to ambushes and artillery and drone strikes in both retreat and counterattacks as there are no fronts any more in the area. 

If Russia is planning hasty counterattacks Ukraine should monitor it and hit assembly areas if possible or ambush/hit with artillery columns leading to assemble. I cannot overstate how great an opportunity this is to destroy/capture substantial Russian army/arms",1662741130.0,1662740129.0,t3_x9l84f,t3_x9l84f,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Unlikely they can sustain fighting in Kupiansk, Lyman, and Izyum at the same time.  The entire reasoning behind this push has been that the area north of Izyum was emptied and underdefended.  It was an intelligent exploitation of troop positions, not brute force.  We've been hearing for months Ukraine does not have the brute force to risk urban warfare in three cities simultaneously, which is why they never enter them; they encircle or cut off supplies and wait for Russia to evacuate.  

And so I would've written these off as rumors except they seem to be more than rumor.  My guess is 'entered Izyum' refers to a village just barely in the city limits or a new offensive *from the south* using existing troops there.

How are they going to transport 100k troops from that far away (NK is nearly as far from Ukraine as Ukraine is from New York)? On the one railroad line between them? In thousands of busses? In North Korea's civil aviation? In what's left of Aeroflot?

NK didn't even participate in Vostok. Do they understand each other's doctrines? Their armaments? Are their communications systems integrated? Are there enough translators? Even if the NKs understand the orders they get from Russian commanders, can they execute them effectively? Can anyone validate the skills and training they've received? Are they even up to Russian, or DPR/LNR standards? Let alone a match for Ukraine's soldiers? If they can't fight, can they do logistics? Do any of them know how to repair an engine?

Those who conducted the offensive work need to be rested, you can get another two weeks, easy if you rest them up for a few days now. Trust me, they'll likely be itching to keep going anyways, victory is like an opioid. The other good part about rest is refit to fight, servicing weapons, equipment and resupplying ammo and conducting repairs.

In more modern and well supplied forces you would rotate men AND equipment, so if you were well enough organised, a second Army/Battalion/Brigade group would be ready to pick up where the first left off. BUT this is really hard to do logistically, so it'll depend on the state of Ukrainian forces in the area. It really would be best to do a proper rotation so they don't break tanks/IFVs/engines/barrels.

Ukraine will need significant numbers of TDF/reserves to clear out any stragglers and process POWs. They have the manpower (mobilised) so it's fairly feasible they've got the resources to action all this and continue advances.

As far as direction, things get interesting from here. If they clear N/NE, they could clear to Russian border.

Heading East and then somewhat South could help them liberate Lyman, which isn't a bad idea as there are some good rivers and things to work with offensively and defensively.

I think the best comparison for the Kharkiv offensive is to [Operation Bagration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration?wprov=sfti1) from WWII, subbing in Kharkiv for Belarus and Kherson for Eastern Ukraine. Basically, the Soviet Union led the NAZIS to believe there was a major counterattack coming to retake Eastern Ukraine after the liberation of Kyiv. So after fixing the NAZI army in Eastern Ukraine, the Soviets then launched a surprise counteroffensive to liberate Belarus. The  NAZIs couldn’t respond because they couldn’t stop defending Eastern Ukraine and the Soviets quickly retook Belarus and started positioning themselves to retake the Baltic countries and Poland.

The problem is that you’re trying to cover three Ukrainian/Russian sounds with two Latin letters: 

- a sound like English “ee” in *seed* (spelled *і* in Ukrainian and *и* in Russian)

- a sound roughly like English “i” in *bid* (spelled *и* in Ukrainian and *ы* in Russian)

- the sound of English “y” in *young*, which *can* be written *й* in both languages but is often written using specialized letters that combine a “y” sound with a following vowel (e.g. Ukrainian *ї є я ю* = “yi” “ye” “ya” “yu”).

One style of transliteration uses Latin <i> for both the “ee” sound and the “y” sound and <y> for the “ih” sound alone.

The other style uses <y> for the “ih” and “y” sounds and <i> for the “ee” sound alone.

2) Ukraine took out the bridges in Kherson, isolating those troops Russia moved down there.

3) Ukraine noticed the weakened state of the Northern army and pounced on a weak point that allowed them to flank around some of Russia's strongest lines of defense in the North, allowing them to encircle substantial pieces of the Russian army and cut off supply lines.

Basically Russia is over-extended and blundered into multiple bad positions at the same time.

In terms of the broader implications of the last couple days, its hard to say.  Its at the very least symbolically important because its proving the Ukraine could push them back.

* Ukraine sees Russian advances slow and stall across the front, assesses that their offensive has culminated; thus, some Russian positions must be thinly manned by understrength units

* Precision strikes on lines of supply further decreased morale and effectiveness of those units

* Intelligence about these weakened positions is acquired through various means (probing attacks, drones, espionage) by Ukraine

* Ukraine is able to amass sufficient equipment and well-trained troops near these weak points after months of preparation

* Ukrainian command, control, and communication systems are made robust enough to allow them to rapidly exploit opportunities as they arise

* Spearheads are launched into the weakest Russian positions and have enough confidence in follow-on forces to rush far ahead where they make progress

* Russian positions, relying primarily on pre-targeted artillery for security, can't retarget towards their rear and are overwhelmed - various new counterbattery systems and radiation-seeking missiles may also be key here

* One position after another falls because there are no available reserves to stymie the advance

* Ukraine is careful (and controlled) enough not to overextend themselves beyond their lines of support and supply

When Ukraine went on the counter-offensive, Russia had to spread their limited remaining forces extremely thin to hold their lines, and they were tricked by Ukraine into positioning the bulk of their forces in the worst possible spot to respond to Ukraine's actual assault.  So Ukraine hit them in the south (where Russia sent much of their defenders) and then launched their main assault way in the northeast, where Russia has light defense and critical supply infrastructure.  Russian soldiers had terrible morale for the entire war, but now they're completely broken.

The answer is to try to deplete the Russian fighting ability as quickly as possible, while risking as little as possible.

He seems to be saying that, at that point, Ukraine will need long-range weapons that can reach into Russia. Russia hides behind a curtain of impunity, and that impunity must be removed. The Russian citizens must begin to fear that the war will come to *them*.

It's a tricky situation, because of Russia using their nuclear weapons as a shield. Without a way to force Russia into a peace agreement, there will continue to be warfare along the border, while Russia rebuilds its military to make a another try. The sanctions may play an important part in bringing this about, although that might take a long time.

I think Putin is still counting on the EU folding over the winter. If the EU can hold out and disabuse him of the idea that UA's allies will eventually fold, I think he can be forced to the negotiating table.

This is a perfectly valid question.  If Ukraine wants to know the answer why can't people discussing Ukraine?  The majority of people here sicken me.  

So from the sources I can piece together it's looking pretty disorganized.  There is not yet an established front for Russia to bring troops to with any safety.  

They do have access to Kupiansk from the north and it looks like the 18th machine gun division (which was brought in from the Pacific and retrained to artillery) is the only named fresh btg in the area, and arrived in Kupiansk the other day.  It may already have been moved, been destroyed, or been joined by others.  There are about 12 hours unaccounted for.  I believe there is only one geolocated video showing movement toward Kupiansk from the eastern front, and it was just a short column of personnel transport vehicles.  

Ukraine broke through the lines of three btgs at the start of this offensive.  Those btgs were not completely wiped out; they evacuated north.  Between them there's probably 1-2 btgs that can be used to establish a new northern front.  The problem is they likely haven't had time to do this.  This is the most disorganized part of the arena at the moment.  When the fleeing troops have reorganized, they will likely apply pressure to Shevchenkove rather than Kupiansk.  That hasn't happened yet.  Balakliya's in the clear.  

Izyum is completely cut off, but they are ferrying helicopters into the city.  As I was corrected earlier, they do possess some helicopters that can carry heavy equipment that isn't tanks or SAMS, but more likely they're trying to return as many infantry as possible that they had previously pulled out of Izyum for other fronts (the S-L battle borrowed a bunch, and possibly some were en route to Kherson, though I think they were still in the Donetsk region).  

Because it seems they missed the window to evacuate Izyum of military, they're going to try to hold it.  All their options are bad at this point.  

Additionally fresh attacks around Izyum and Lyman seem to be designed to hold units in place and prevent them from moving toward the Kharkiv offensive.",False,1662782272.0,t3_x9l84f,t1_int5zwt,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

If it's surveillance, that's a sloppy pattern... It won't be as accurate as NATO's.

Also, while FORTE, or the Guardrails, or any E-3's do not *show* on FL24 at the moment, there's been some curious transponder issues occurring in commercial flights along the Black Sea near FORTE's (and the Royal Navy's) usual route - it's oddly close to shore.  (If this is typical, and I've just been missing it in the past, I welcome the correction - u/HawkeyedHuntress .)

2. No, just because its taking longer for the Ukrainians to ""crack the Kherson nut"" doesn't mean its a failure...or even that they've taken massive unsustainable casualties.

The Oskil is being used to isolate the Russian forces in Izium, and its about trying to destroy as much of those forces as possible. That will free Ukranian units in that area to move to other areas, to threaten them. Once the Russians realize they dont have enough people to man their new lines, they will have to reorganize, likely ceding a lot of land back to the Ukrainians, similar to what happened in the North.

&#x200B;

Similarly I think retaking Kherson is only a secondary objective of the southern drive. The primary goal is to destroy the Russian units on the west bank of the Dnipro. That will simultaneously force the Russians to relocate forces to prevent a crossing and free up Ukrainian forces to attack the Russian lines in other areas.

&#x200B;

Russia's only real option here is to hope to find some defensible lines, mass mobilize, and stall until those units are able to be deployed. They really have to surrender land. Fortunately for Ukraine, theyve been unwilling to do any of those things, so Russia gets more and more stretched to the point where they are going to start failing everywhere, be forced to reorganize their lines, and have to seed more and more land while simultaneously losing the troops they need to defend what they have left.",False,1662771843.0,t3_x9l84f,t1_insnped,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Yes, I called it a few weeks ago when Russia redeployed to the south; Ukraine is far quicker to redeploy and has made gains every time Russia switches theatres (not an expert by any stretch, I just watch the maps and logistics strikes).

As for my predictions here, I think Ukraine will push enough to create a corridor in/out and link up with partisans in Izyum, but I don't see them storming unless Russia flees. They're most likely better positioned to just break logistics corridors and the city can be taken with a lot less loss.

Down south, I think Ukraine will maintain fire control over Kherson logistics routes and move to take Nova Kakovkha while Russians are pinned in Kherson, however I think if they feel they can take Kherson they will. Ultimately it's going to come down to the softest spot Ukraine can establish a foothold across the river, and I think it's Nova Kakovkha (doubling back towards Kherson to cut off Crimean supplies, and towards Melitopol to cut off the land bridge to Crimea altogether).",False,1662779675.0,t3_x9l84f,t1_int8fds,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

And you'd be making an enormous mistake in doing so. Putin currently is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to general mobilization. From a military perspective, he needs a general mobilization to win the war (even though that might not be enough), but from a political perspective a general mobilization is deeply unpopular. So far he has resisted the call from the military to mobilize, because he is not willing to pay the political price for it. Once Ukrainian troops actually openly beleaguer Russian cities, that sentiment will change. People are a lot more willing to be drafted to defend their country, than to fight in a war across their borders. Essentially, by crossing into Russia you'd be handing Putin the solution to his current conundrum. 

Additionally, Russia is still a nuclear country and their nuclear doctrine states that they will use (tactical) nukes to destroy attacking armies. While it's still not very likely they'd go that far, it still remains a precarious situation that must not escalate any further. Attacking into Russia would destabilize things further and increase the risk of a global nuclear war.

Lastly, there is no actual strategic reason to attack into Russia outside of some raids and sabotages. The goal is to liberate Ukraine. Just as the Russian people would be more happy to defend their country if attacked, so would the Ukrainian people be less happy if precious military resources and lives are used to attack Russia rather than liberate Ukraine. Such a move would carry a significant political cost for the Ukrainian government. 

All in all, your suggestion would present a huge escalation and destabilizing factor for the entire globe, while simultaneously handing Putin a huge political gift without accomplishing any strategic objectives and even undermining the Ukrainian goals.",False,1662748063.0,t3_x9l84f,t1_inr8j3t,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

 >The 1975 spring offensive (Vietnamese: chiến dịch mùa Xuân 1975), officially known as the general offensive and uprising of spring 1975 (Vietnamese: Tổng tiến công và nổi dậy mùa Xuân 1975) was the final North Vietnamese campaign in the Vietnam War that led to the capitulation of Republic of Vietnam. After the initial success capturing Phước Long Province, the North Vietnamese leadership increased the scope of the People's Army of Vietnam's (PAVN) offensive and captured and held the key Central Highlands city of Buôn Ma Thuột between 10 and 18 March. These operations were intended to be preparatory to launching a general offensive in 1976.

Unit-wise, I actually don't know if we've seen enough to conclude that. I think Russia still possesses the capability to slip most of its units out of Izyum to the south. Yes, they'd take bad losses, but nothing they can't come back from in time. They managed to recover better than most of us anticipated after they retreated 50+ thousand troops out of the northwest and northeast salients around Kyiv.

The bigger damage, I think, is what this does to Russia's army politically. They're getting squeezed hard in Kherson, their northern flank in Kharkiv has just evaporated. There has been a growing sense of a narrative all summer that Russia's turn to take territory is over after August. And September seems to have started off with a huge bang.

What's most interesting is that in the last two hours I've seen reports that Russia is actually attempting to reinforce Izyum. That is mind-blowing to me.

Actually, those require headquarters units in most cases.

Handheld radios can connect up to the horizon, which is 3km on flat lands (but 30km if you're on the top of a mountain). Because Ukraine is mostly flat, those radios are only 3km in practice. Its impossible to go any further, because the literal horizon blocks the radio wave.

You fix this by connecting to a repeater station, which turns your 3km range into 30km to 50km through a combination of higher-power, as well as radio-frequency magic that bounces off of the atmosphere to other communicators. (IE: a repeater recieves the signal, then repeats it in a longer-distance, higher-powered fashion, allowing for longer communication distances)

I don't know much about military encrypted radios. But if we're talking about hobby / ham radios, that's how ham radios work. Ham radio operators absolutely rely upon repeaters to get practical range (ie: more than 5km).

---------

Now that's a kind of antenna that fits on a car, that you can drive around. So such a headquarters / repeater unit could very well be mobile. But if you blowup the headquarters / car, the central point for that platoon / company or so, then the entire group cannot connect back ""home"" 50km away anymore (and home connects to the rest of the military), and only have local communications within the group remaining.

----------

Headquarters would be responsible for talking up the chain anyway. So you need a bunch of guys with notebooks passing messages up-and-down the communication lines. (Squad1 talks to Platoon leader. Platoon leader writes some notes, decides to talk with Squad3 3km away and also Company leader 20km away. Company leader might talk to the general 100km away, and then relay a message back to the Platoon ). Or so I imagine anyway, I dunno how the military talks but the physics of radios won't change...

In any case, 50km radio ranges are the stuff of a car-mounted repeater unit. Not a handheld device. **Maybe** a handheld device that's put on the top of a mountain / hill can do that, but that practically makes the hill your headquarters, ya know?",1662758519.0,1662758023.0,t3_x9l84f,t1_inrz1zy,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

 >A hypocorism ( hy-POK-ər-iz-əm or  HY-pə-KORR-iz-əm; from Ancient Greek: ὑποκόρισμα (hypokorisma), from ὑποκορίζεσθαι (hypokorizesthai), 'to call by pet names', sometimes also hypocoristic) or pet name is a name used to show affection for a person or object. It may be a diminutive form of a person's name, such as Izzy for Isabel or Bob for Robert, or it may be unrelated. In linguistics, the term can be used more specifically to refer to a specific morphological process where a word is clipped down to a closed monosyllable and then suffixed with -y/-ie (phonologically /i/), or to words resulting from this process.

 >Operation Storm (Serbo-Croatian: Operacija Oluja / Операција Олуја) was the last major battle of the Croatian War of Independence and a major factor in the outcome of the Bosnian War. It was a decisive victory for the Croatian Army (HV), which attacked across a 630-kilometre (390 mi) front against the self-declared proto-state Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and a strategic victory for the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). The HV was supported by the Croatian special police advancing from the Velebit Mountain, and the ARBiH located in the Bihać pocket, in the Army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina's (ARSK) rear.

It was one of the final battles of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, and is remembered as one of American history's bloodiest, most lopsided battles.
