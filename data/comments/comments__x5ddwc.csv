Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 4 September 2022

- Russian forces continue to suffer from morale and discipline issues in Ukraine. In addition to combat fatigue and high casualties, one of the main grievances from deployed Russian soldiers probably continues to be problems with their pay.

- In the Russian military, troops' income consists of a modest core salary, augmented by a complex variety of bonuses and allowances. In Ukraine, there has highly likely been significant problems with sizable combat bonuses not being paid. This is probably due to inefficient military bureaucracy, the unusual legal status of the 'special military operation, and at least some outright corruption amongst commanders.

- The Russian military has consistently failed to provide basic entitlements to troops deployed in Ukraine, including appropriate uniform, arms and rations, as well as pay. This has almost certainly contributed to the continued fragile morale of much of the force.",False,1662275286.0,t3_x5ddwc,t3_x5ddwc,,0,166,0,166,0,0,

Then, using fake profiles of attractive women on Facebook and Russian social media websites, they tricked soldiers into sending photos that they geolocated, and shared with the Ukrainian military. “The Russians, they always want to fuck,” said Knysh. “They send [a] lot of shit to ‘girls’, to prove that they are warriors.”

Day 193 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, or at least there was no shelling *yet*, but instead they did an extremely early missile strike in the middle of the day. It was around 6:15pm, and suddenly a moderately loud sound of explosion happened, then another one, and a couple more after that. During the day the sound of an explosion is very different than during the night, it’s much quieter, the ambient sound of the city muffles the explosion sound extremely well, so it sounds barely louder than regular shelling.

They aimed at a residential district full of civilians during the day, one of the missiles landed right between a private house and an apartment building, there is barely 5-10 meters between each of them. Miraculously nobody died, and only 2 people were injured, if that missile landed just a bit to the side there would have been a lot of civilian casualties. There is nothing military related anywhere near, they specifically aimed at civilians *again*, but thankfully they missed.

A pretty funny thing that happened today/yesterday was that Russians decided to do an online survey/referendum in Kharkiv oblast, about whether people here want to become a part of Russia, become an independent “people’s republic”, or remain as a part of Ukraine. 

Well, to their surprise in a couple of hours 46k people took part in it, and the results weren’t what Russians expected at all. Just 0.1% of people wanted to become “people’s republic”, then 3.5% wanted to be “reunited with Russia” and then an overwhelming 96.4% voted to stay as a part of Ukraine. 

Just a couple of hours after that happened Russians took down their survey website, because of a result they weren’t expecting. This, coupled with their losses in Kherson region, is probably the reason they decided to fire missiles at Kharkiv during the day. When Russians suffer losses *anywhere in Ukraine*, they *always* bombard our city with everything they can to “take revenge”. So this just confirms that their recent losses hurt them a lot, otherwise they wouldn’t be raging so much and firing missiles at civilians.

In general however, Girkin appears to admit the progress of Ukrainian counter-offensive in numerous locations and the establishment of a Ukrainian foothold near at river Inhulets. According to Girkin, bridges of Dnieper are practically non-operational which prevents the large Russian group from being re-supplied. While at the moment the results of the counter-offensive are unclear as it is too early to draw conclusions, Ukrainian forces have all chances of moving forward due to parity in artillery capabilities.

The Russians still have superiority in aviation but severely lack manpower to carry out any counter-counter-offensive operations to stop Ukrainians, and have to play from defence completely.

> The demonstration had been called by an alliance including the AfD district association of Western Pomerania, the district association of Western Pomerania-Greifswald of ""Die Basis"" and the Monday Citizens' Movement. The participants of the demo came from different political groups and walks of life. Some had brought German flags with the inscription ""We are the people"", others waved Russian flags. On banners were slogans such as ""Red-Yellow-Green to the Eastern Front"", ""Nord Stream 2 instead of fracking gas"" and ""Your sanctions hit us"". According to police, the demonstration proceeded without incident.

It's possible that international friction within the administration due to the war will undermine some of the mechanisms used to rig elections, but the whole point of using ALL the techniques simultaneously is the you have lots of redundancy and the result is guaranteed even if some methods fail or are less effective than hoped.

So in short, the probably or Putin losing power through electoral processes is virtually zero, and that is unchanged by the war or its outcomes. If Putin does lose an election, its not because the public's will has changed, but because he has lost the support of political, law enforcement, and media elites to such an extent that the election-rigging machinery is no longer able or willing to work in his favour.

This can be seen directly from putin's army recruitment strategy. He dont do a general mobilization because conscripting a bunch of people who dont want to go to war will make them mad, and overthrow Kremlin. He also dont recruit people from Moscow and St Petersburg because this is his foundation.

However, as the war drag on we see exactly this. Putin is trying to recruit via more forceful manner, and he is starting to recruit in Moscow.

2. Regional insurrection that can turn into a civil war (e.g.: the wars that led to the Meiji Restoration for instance)

The key here is that Russia's choke-point is resupply - particularly heavy equipment, which includes air-defence systems.

By attacking on a long front, Ukraine is giving the Russians Hobson's choice.  On the one hand, they can retreat rapidly into a defensible position, with whatever supplies and equipment they currently have.  They could then maximize remaining assets by using whatever remains of air-defence to cover the smallest area, and focus on at least keeping the sky clear of drones.  But that will look like a complete rout, and it won't go over very well on Telegram or back in Russia.

On the other hand they can hold their positions and brag about holding off a Ukrainian counter-offensive that's just strong enough to fix them in position, but not so strong that a huge force is exposed to defensive artillery...  In this scenario, Russia will grind through supplies and lose heavy equipment almost as fast as if they are on offense...  And their shrinking air defense assets are spread out over a huge wide area.  Ultimately, they end up as infantry on foot when they run out of vehicles and fuel, and completely vulnerable to drone spotted artillery.

The smart thing would be to retreat.  But count on the Russians not to recognize it quickly and instead try to defend...   Ultimately they will be attrited back to Kherson, which will be put to siege, but by then, Ukraine will have ground them down while preserving a lot of strength.   Which can be put to good use elsewhere - because a lot of Russian effort is going to have to be put in place to keep the Kherson garrison from being overwhelmed, and that's effort that can't be supporting an offensive, or defending against other counter-offensives.

It looks like the leadership believes the second the war starts affecting the larger population the popularity will turn, and while the Russian economy (apparently) isn't crashing right now, it's clear that either Russia is refusing to send its best stuff because it is saving it for a big war or the best stuff was already used and we're seeing the dregs. Russia's true allies aren't plugging those holes either because the stuff they have isn't much better than the new arms Ukraine is getting- or is not better at all (Iran), or because those allies have enough problems to be willing to send aid (""We survived the Syrian Civil War because we still have your troops here, you think we can offer our own!?!""). Russia also has its ""sort of friendly"" states, but they have their limits too. China will happily parrot anti-West propaganda for its own purposes, but it seems unwilling to send them weapons. India has a fascinating and complex history with Russia, but it's balancing its resale of Russian oil with cutting Russian arms purchases- let alone its disinterest in supporting the war even rhetorically.

The real problem is figuring out how to end it. The West seems a little ""once bitten twice shy"" about letting Russia go (twice bitten if you count Georgia), so it's likely to require guarantees if Russia is going to salvage a win from this (recognition of Crimea in return for Ukraine's immediate NATO accession? Big cash infusion as well as sanction relief in return for full withdrawal from Ukraine?), and the question is whether it can be sold to the populace in a way to keep the leadership in place (nationalists who want land will likely scream if Russia gets to hold on to Crimea and explode if they lose it). Wars that go poorly can go badly for the leadership too- the Russo-Japanese war led to a revolution that shook the monarchy, WWI broke it, and Afghanistan helped destabilize the USSR.

We've heard figures from 20k to 30k russians, but not all of those are deployed ""along the frontline"". And, more importantly that number includes a large number of personell not actually fighting, like cooks, drivers, mexhanics, etc.
Not sure about the russian tooth-to-tail ratio, but we could assume most of those aren't really active fighters. 

The ideea is to achieve superiority in certain areas when attacking, and since the russians have (voluntarily or not) assumed a defensive stance, Ukraine might choose to leave some areas under-manned and concentrate their fighting power in other locaitions to achieve a local superiority in men and material for creating and exploiting a breakthrough.

I think it is unlikely they would attack with only parity or numerical inferiority (ofc, depending on the local tactical situation it might happen) when going on main attack directions or when storming some objectives, so on those locations they probably strive to achieve as much of a superiority as possible.

Let me tell you a story.

Once there was an America, who in 2021 re-elected Donald Trump as president.

Well, he and his mate Putin had a plan. 

Putin invaded Ukraine. They were weak. Isolated, Ukraine fell in a few months.

Putin and Russia celebrated. Trump hailed him as a Savy genius.

Trump worked with Putin and they had a great time. Trump cleaned out the FBI and the CIA of all the traitors.

Putin had access to all of Trumps secrets and Trump got invited to golf.

Soon Americas tax laws made sure the rich got richer, and the poor got more numerous, just like Russia.

Trump was happy.

Who would have thought Putin wasn’t really Trump’s friend.

Over the next few years, Germany helped Russia take Moldova, Hungary and then poland. 

Then one day, when Putin owned all the banks in America, he had trump thrown out of a window. Afterall, American presidents are only in power for 8 years. He was no longer useful and he knew too much.

From casually looking at these numbers for some time, my assumption is that they're using methods that lean slightly towards undercounting, and that either due to opsec or due to their methods needing time for verification, they dont always report exactly on time. I would also not be surprised if they have a more accurate list going behind the scenes, and just report more generic numbers daily to avoid giving away too much info.

When everybody knew that the federal republic will break apart, representatives from the biggest republic (SR Serbia) went to SR Croatia and SR BIH to incite unrest form Serbs within those republics. In 1991., when Croatia declared independence a part of serbian population in Croatia started a revolution and made 3 breakaway states (Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina, SAO western Slavonia and SAO eastern Slavonia) which they later merged in one (Republic of Serbian Krajina). War broke out and SR Serbia and SR Montenegro (known as Yugoslavia at the time, but Yugoslavia was no more without SR Croatia, SR Slovenia and soon without SR BiH) invaded Croatia from multiple fronts to ""help"" Serbian Krajina (which was promised to be annexed in the greater Serbia (look up war criminal Milošević which was the head of state in SR Serbia). If you still think that was not an invasion look up battle of Vukovar (just a hint, separatists didn't have that much firepower), or siege of Dubrovnik (seperatist states were not even close to Dubrovnik, invading plan was to take Dubrovnik) etc. 

Does this modus operandi seem familiar? Bigger country inciting unrest in the smaller country by its ethnic people, they make breakaway states, and then big brother comes to ""save"" their people with tanks and artillery, razing cities, fighting on the land of the smaller countries, and all you lose is manpower, tanks and credibility (a small price to pay if you see what you can gain). The real victim is the smaller country which will have visible wounds the next 30-50 years (destroyed houses, mines, shells which kids will collect and play with etc.). Don't get me started on PTSD of the whole nation, everybody remembers running to shelters and being afraid, huge chunk of population has somebody dear dead or injured during the war.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,x5ddwc,in2pziv,"Well relief from sanctions and economic/energy dependence are very different things. I'm supportive of dropping sanctions if the following criteria are observed:

* Putin either six feet under or in the Hague, along with all officials and political figures who enabled and supported his war (Lavrov, Peskov, Shoigu, etc)
* Constitutional change in Russia that legally declares unambiguously the sovereign inviolability of Ukraine and all former USSR nations
* Obviously total and complete withdrawal of Russian forces - goes without saying but someone will @ me if I don't include it 
* Commitment to full reparations of damage sustained to Ukraine - probably this will be a long and difficult process for Russia to pull off, probably decades, and I'm prepared to accept lifting sanctions before the reparations are fully paid *IF* the new Russian administration shows genuine steps at beginning this process for a window of trial time. I know the knee jerk reaction would be to demand full payment before relieving sanctions but let's be pragmatic - if Russia actually commits to reparations, they'll need to actually have an economy to begin with. We can look at Germany as an example - read my caveats below before responding to this point. 
* Release of all political prisoners during Putin's reign - retrial under transparent courts if there is significant chance that such a prisoner is genuinely guilty of something
* Mandatory international inspections of Russias military force and nuclear arsenal
* Commitment to denounce and end cyberwarfare, trolling and political manipulation efforts - use the return of sanctions as a consequence of any political shenanigans in foreign countries 
* Something has to be done about their nuclear threat. I don't know what. It's a difficult one. Russia knows better than anyone how vulnerable they would be without them so likely even a moderate regime appearing in Russia would absolutely rule out decommissioning them entirely.

Caveats.

1. Expecting a new Russian regime to be open to all of the above is a total pipe dream, if for no other reason than the population will largely be against it. My point isn't to say that this will happen, just what I would consider a good list of terms for the west to present to Russia in the event of regime change and an end to the war. The rest is for them to figure out.

2. About the repayments - people here seem wildly divided on whether Russia resembles WW1 or WW2 era Germany. If it's the former, some argue, utter and total humiliation will lead to a new Hitler-esque character who will be even worse. If it's the latter, some argue, a comprehensive Marshall Plan for Russia may lead to a repeat of Germany's post-Nazi history. I think neither are really helpful analogies here. A Marshall Plan would be difficult to pull off because it would first require mass de-brainwashing and dismantling of the Russian state, probably impossible without occupying Russia itself. 

Because the west cannot occupy Russia due to the nuclear threat, I actually tend towards using economic sanctions to utterly break the country economically instead. The problem there is that it could as easily become North Korea 2.0 as it could force the Russians to accept the West's terms. I don't really see any other way to guarantee (as much as is possible) that Russia doesn't become a threat in the future, and that really should be the end goal here.

He was practical, grounded, and believed in putting effort into repairing and restoring things so that they'd last twice as long. He passed at 96 years old - by then he had two grandchildren and relished in the fact that his last name had, ""polluted,"" the relatively nice area that we lived (more on that in a moment).  He intentionally stopped taking his heart medication because, and I'm not making this up, ""I've been around and I've seen everything that I need to - I'm not getting paid overtime to keep having to do this."" He also didn't want to die at home - he wanted to die at the hospital... But the doctor told him that they couldn't keep him there any longer and that they'd discharge him to his home under hospice care.  ... That's when he *really* stopped taking his heart meds (he had intentionally missed a few which ended him there in the first place but now it was a hard *no* because that's not how it was going to go down).  He died one hour prior to when he was supposed to be discharged.  I was told that the heat attacks were very painful because my wife was there during several of them (she is a nurse, but respects people's wishes) - which is when he told my wife the 'polluted' thing.  That was four hours before he died.  ...  It hurt, but he died proud and with satisfaction - and he said as much during the process.

   Back to the 'polluted' thing.  When he originally moved to the US, he settled in Detroit and saved quarters in a jar to move my grandmother and father to the US.  At the time, where I live now and have most of my life, the place I live in was a place someone with a foreign sounding last name was *not allowed* to move into. My father married my mother and they got a house here in the late '70's when things were different.  Both my parents were teachers. My father and mother weren't that bad, and zero disrespect to my mother, my father excelled at teaching and has impacted thousands of lives for the better by engaging them and showing the magic of*their own* ingenuity - earning a presidential award in the process (yes, I'm kind of bragging, but he earned it - he *is* good, I know, because I had him for my 2nd hour).

  Regardless, because I digress, - my grandfather's proudest achievements were that he had managed to get his family to safty, that he had done what he could to provide for them and keep them safe, and that my father had participated in dismantling a practice that he viewed as unjust.  That said, his final middle finger was the fact he had grandchildren - and that he would be survived by them.

Second of all it would definitely help Ukraine's message to the world that the military support that is receiving from the west is having a significantly positive impact on Ukraine chances in this war.

They might be more concerned about a net loss of troops rather than freeing up troops. Think about any situation where you have a hostile force trapped inside fortifications. Unless you have overwhelming superiority, you are almost guaranteed to take losses trying to storm them. But if you starve them out, you can take the same position without any losses at all. In a couple of months, there won't be much offensive activity from either side, so there's even less urgency to reinforce the eastern front. Losing lots of soldiers to slightly speed up the capture timetable might not make any military sense at all.

Additionally, even if Ukraine takes Kherson, they'll still need a large defensive force to hold their new lines. They can't relocate everyone like when the threat to Kyiv went away.

Saving large numbers of civilians can be a reason to spend more soldier lives pushing aggressively, but even there, they have to weigh the long-term value of those soldiers to the overall goal of liberating the country. Russia isn't trying to kill every single civilian in assembly line fashion. There will be civilian casualties, but hopefully not on the order of Russia's neighborhood by neighborhood shelling campaigns. In fact, taking the fight into the middle of the city instead of starving out the defenders could cost more civilian lives than it saves. Meanwhile, breaking Ukraine's ability to conduct further offensive operations will set back the liberation of all the other remaining territory.

As the Assistant Commandant says ""artillery is a thing, the capability is long range fires."" To an army HIMARS just gives them them a jump in ability over artillery in both terms of range and mobility which leads to greater survivability.

Yes a GMLRS M30/31 rocket for HIMARS that Ukraine has been supplied with are great for taking out targets in populated areas due to their high accuracy but it was not conceived as being for that purpose and that is not how it is thought of in the military force structure. They'd hit anything with a HIMARS that it could hit and that its payload would be useful against.

Basically those troops will be forced either evacuate or surrender, or die. Doubt they will choose the latter. I'm not advocating for Ukraine to storm the city, i can understand that confusion about that argument, i should have specified the Kherson Oblast in my argument (the west part of it), rather than simply saying Kherson.  


They will need to keep some powerful elements in the vicinity of Kherson, yes. But i think a significant part of that would be able to be move to other fronts, because the river is just such a huge obstacle against any kind of serious operation to take the city again.

Even after Ukrainians retake Kherson, they will not conduct a counter offensive across the Dnieper. I've explained this fact in previous threads myself.

  
However in war there is more than just going on offense, defense is also important. and retaking the Kherson bridgehead (the entire west bank of the Oblast) would give Ukraine a formidable defensive position, and that defensive position, the river, would give Ukraine the strategic value of taking Kherson, which is the ability to simply move those troops, and resources, to other fronts where they are most needed.

Your comments focus a lot on the Kherson city. So i want to make something clear, i did not advocate for Ukraine to storm the city itself. That action would be unnecessary, the moment that Ukraine is actually able to siege the city, will be the moment that Russians will leave the city, because there is no way for them supply that city, under sieged, with a damaged bridge that isn't even located inside the city limits. 

The discussion about casualties is a red herring. Going on offense will result in casualties, and Ukraine won't retake their territory by just saying on defense hoping that Russia will just keep throwing its men and resources at the bridge to nowhere in Kherson so that Ukraine can keep blowing them up. 

Your last comment is pathetic really, i wasn't offended by your comment as you are implying, i was only pointing out how fruitless this discussion was going to be, because if you are not willing to actually engage with the person's arguments and point out how you think they are wrong, then why even bother replying to them?",False,1662348663.0,t3_x5ddwc,t1_in4zm0n,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
