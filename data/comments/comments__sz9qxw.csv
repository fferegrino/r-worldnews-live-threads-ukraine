""Russia has massed soldiers near the Ukrainian border - in bad conditions. This suggests that a decision about attack or withdrawal must be made soon. In the mostly makeshift dwellings in which the military personnel are currently being housed, they cannot stay for more than a few days. There is already some concern about the morale of the troops.

One example is a picture from a train station shared by the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia group. According to the NGO, which has repeatedly criticized the conditions in the Russian army and has therefore often been at odds with the government, these are soldiers from the Second Motorized Guards Rifle Division, and the exact location of their quarters is said to have been Wesjolaja Lopan. But it is obvious that they are crowded together in a small room. The group goes on to say that food rations are not working and the soldiers have to buy their own food. According to the reports, the soldiers have now been moved on, but several are said to have stayed behind at the station.

There are also complaints from Belarus, as Radio Free Europe reported a few days ago. The soldiers would also live there in tents and also drink a lot of alcohol. In this case, too, the supply is poor, which is why a black market has opened up on which military personnel sell fuel, for example, in order to be able to feed themselves with the money they raise. Residents also complain that the heavy equipment is destroying roads and fields.""",False,1645623079.0,t3_sz9qxw,t3_sz9qxw,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

Every hour of inaction now is a threat to the lives of Ukrainians, not only military but also civilians, including women and children.Ukraine defends not only global security, but also freedom, democracy and fundamental principles of int'l law. Peaceful life of millions of people in Europe and around the globe rely on the rules that 🇷🇺 tries to destroy. Diplomacy & int'l fora must prevail and stop 🇷🇺aggression.Russia must withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine and stop destabilizing the int'l security situation.

However, I'm curious if there might be another explanation: that things have not really calmed down at all, but that we simply have much less information filtering out of the area to the outside world. There are several indicators that this might be the case:

\- Ukranians have appealed for people not to share movements about Ukrainian troop movements. Many of the OSINT accounts and other observers have declared that they will not be doing so, and encouraged others not to do so either.

\- Last night, many of the major OSINT twitter accounts were simultaneously blocked by Twitter, with their accounts suspended for 12 hours and no possibility to appeal.

The Guardian can confirm that the warning of an imminent attack has gone out to Ukraine and allies and that the UK shared the US assessment.  
  
Diplomats I have been talking to are aware the West has cried wolf once before, on 16 February, so there are caveats.  
  
There was also a scare last night, when some intelligence suggested an all-out attack was about to happen but it turned out to be a false alarm.  
  
The bottom line is there are large Russian formations on the move, so the assessment is that an onslaught could be unleashed at any time.

Russia will target the Ukraine military first and foremost, but also political targets (i.e, the Ukrainian government), and will also go after ""morale"" targets, things and places important to the Ukrainian national identity in an attempt to lower the populations moral and willingness to fight. He also expects Russia to target civilians for the same reason. His prediction was a quick and brutal assault on Ukraine, the installation of a puppet government, and then a relatively quick withdrawal. He didn't seem to think Russia was interested in occupying if they don't have to, and to the question of Ukrainian insurgency he said Russian military will brutally crackdown on that to make people afraid to fight the occupation. The one potential advantage Ukraine has is morale, the Russian soilders are not psyched about this war, they've been sleeping in tents on the front lines for weeks, etc; but a lot of Ukrainians are willing to die for their country.

One out of every two Russians (50%) says it would be right to keep Ukraine out of NATO by military force, while only a quarter (25%) say it would be wrong. The other quarter (25%) are unsure, according to the survey.

But the poll also found that more Russians think it would be wrong than right to use military force “to reunite Russia and Ukraine” – two countries with a long and complicated history of being intertwined.

It’s a close call, but 43% of Russians said use of military force against Ukraine to join it to Russia would be wrong, while 36% said it would be right. (The rest of the respondents said they didn’t know if it would be right or wrong.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, most people in Ukraine disagree with the use of force against them. Seven out of 10 respondents there said it would be wrong for Russia to use military force to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO (70%) or to reunite the two countries (73%).",1645609695.0,1645609581.0,t3_sz9qxw,t3_sz9qxw,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the commanders-in-chief of the Russian Air Force and Black Sea Fleet, leading state “propagandists” - as well as 351 Duma deputies - are expected to be targeted in EU sanctions announced later on Wednesday.

The measures, which have to be signed off by EU foreign ministers, would go further than those announced by the US - and well beyond Boris Johnson’s Russia sanctions.

If approved, the EU will impose asset freezes and travel bans on 23 people, three banks and a notorious internet ‘troll factory’ in St Petersburg, in response to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The bloc is also expected to sanction 351 members of the Russian state Duma that voted for recognition of the two territories.

Maybe I'm naive, and someone can explain this. But these personal sanctions always seemed pointless to me.

Nebenzya also questioned the title of the UN assembly meeting, arguing that the title should reflect Ukraine losing territory due to its treatment of its own citizens.

Nebenzya, as he wrapped up his speech, said:

>The State Duma called the conditions for the confiscation of savings of Russians ECONOMIC .  21 FEBRUARY, 2022 /15:13 The government may seize the deposits of the population if the West blocks all funds located abroad.  This opinion was expressed in a conversation with NEWS.ru by State Duma deputy from the Communist Party Nikolai Arefiev, commenting on the warning of economist Mikhail Khazin about the danger of confiscation of savings.  Khazin said that the savings of Russians could be confiscated in a new economic crisis.  Arefiev explained that Russia has $640 billion of gold and foreign exchange reserves located abroad, in addition, 14 trillion rubles of the National Welfare Fund (NWF) and the capital of oligarchs, estimated at $470 billion, are stored there. He recalled that sanctions against Russia may include disconnecting from SWIFT  and a ban on currency exchange.  The EU also sued, wanting to fine Russia $290bn for import substitution",1645638543.0,1645638117.0,t3_sz9qxw,t3_sz9qxw,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

The end of the Syrain war was INSANE. So a NATO country and Russia have killed each other’s troops in the last few years. Yes, you read that correctly. They have quite literally killed each other’s troops, this past decade. And we did not go to WW3. On top of that Russian planes and ships harass NATO planes and ships often. No world war. 

In [2015](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Russian_Sukhoi_Su-24_shootdown) NATO country Turkey, shot down a Russian SU-24 warplane. 1 Russian pilot was KIA. So let’s make this clear, a Russian plane was killed by a NATO country. The [year](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) before that Russia/Russian backed rebels in Ukraine, shot down a passenger plane, killing 298 civilians, most of whom were from NATO countries. To be clear, Russia killed hundreds of NATO civilians, for no reason. In [2018](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Khasham) the US leveled an attack of Syrian forces that may or may not have included Russian contractors, some of whom who may or not not have been killed in the battle (there conflicting reports). In [2020](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Balyun_airstrikes) we have our biggest casualty event between NATO and Russia. Russia straight up bombed and killed dozens of actual Turkish soldiers (not Turkish rebels or mercs). So Russia killed dozens of soldiers from a NATO country in an active warzone, on purpose. No war. 

There lots of examples of Russians buzzing NATO craft, Russian and American convoys of humvees blocking each other or I think even crashing one time. Syria was wild. Russia has been cyber attacking NATO for a decade. Hell if you go back to the Cold War there were times when US and Soviet pilots fight in air to air combat and killed each other….no WW3. 

People here seem to assume that if one single bullet accidentally flies into NATO lands, then nukes will fly 4 minutes later. That’s not even slightly true. Unless Russia starts invading Poland or something, or a bunch of NATO troops are killed, it’s not happening. Russia could accidentally shell Romania if they were invading and fighting in Ukraine near the border, kill 10 NATO troops, and there would be no war. Because at the end of the day people understand that WW3 would be terrible and at best cost millions of lives and at worst kill ruin our planet and species. Small provocations aren’t worth that, to either side.

An even slimmer chance that it will go nuclear. There is also a slim to nil chance that anybody's lives will be disrupted as a result of this, except if you live in Ukraine, or find it difficult to pay for gas.

You have a valid right to be concerned on behalf of the Ukrainian people. But do not be concerned for your own safety if you do not live in Ukraine. Likewise, do not be concerned that this will disrupt any of your plans in the short-to-mid-term. Even if they involve travel to Europe in the next month or so. You have very little to be worried about.

People saying shit like 'make sure to breathe and stay hydrated' are making out like this is something that poses an immediate and direct threat to their lives and that should be obsessively followed.

My suggestion is that if following this is going beyond curiousity for you and veering into obsession, stick your head in the sand for a while. You will notice nothing different. Then come back in a better headspace. The answer is not breathing, staying hydrated and getting some vitamin D.

It seems obvious that if/when the invasion starts it, like all modern invasions, will be preceded by airstrikes.  So as soon as the ""real"" invasion is beginning, Ukraine will know without certainty that ""this is it.""

Ukraine has hundreds of aircraft.  In excess of 75% of all Russian forces are in known positions on their borders.  Rather than take defensive actions, wouldn't it be reasonable for Ukraine to launch their own offensive to obliterate as many Russian troops on the ground as quickly as possible, before the units move and scatter?  They are concentrated right now like fish in a barrel.

Surely Russia has their own planes, their own anti-aircraft weapons etc.  But Ukraine is outmatched here.  The only way it makes sense for them to achieve a rapid and decisive victory would be to inflict max-pain immediately, and the way to do that is with their targets concentrated and pinned in known locations.

- ~~Ukraine had no intention of joining NATO prior to Russia invading them and annexing parts of their country.~~ My mistake; Ukraine briefly tried joining NATO in 2008, but the process was shelved almost immediately. 

- NATO was never in discussions with Ukraine about even becoming a member prior to 2014; the revolts that occurred that year were over Ukraine seeking closer ties with the European Union, an economic market.

- NATO does not invite potential partners to join if they have disputed borders. Crimea qualifies as a disputed border.

- NATO has not even offered Ukraine a pathway to membership, commonly known as the Membership Action Plan (MAP) process.

- On the former point, even if NATO were to offer Ukraine the opportunity to begin the MAP process, it takes a decade at least for a country to join NATO when the process begins. North Macedonia took almost twelve years to join NATO after beginning the process.

- Even if NATO were to give Putin express promises that Ukraine won't join NATO, Putin has said multiple times that he blames the West for violating a promise made to Gorbachev in 1989 that NATO wouldn't expand.

This rhetoric is similar to what China has been telling.

I think the truth is in the middle.

""Pakistan PM Imran Khan to visit Moscow  
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan will embark on a two-day visit to Moscow on Wednesday, amid heightened tensions around the crisis in Ukraine, for a high-level visit that will focus on regional security and a major gas pipeline deal.  
Khan is due to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday, Putin’s office said in a statement.  
A Pakistani foreign ministry statement said that the Putin-Khan summit-level talks will cover “major regional and international issues, including Islamophobia and \[the\] situation in Afghanistan”.  
Notably absent from official statements around the visit has been any mention of the crisis in Ukraine. In an interview with Russian television station Russia Today that aired on Tuesday, Khan said that he did not believe there was a military solution to the conflict in Ukraine and said that he hoped matters would be resolved through mediation.""

> The ruble and stocks of Russian companies rose sharply after US President Joe Biden's speech on the situation in Ukraine. This can be seen from the data of the Moscow Exchange.

> The U.S. leader said that the U.S. is imposing sanctions against Russia's sovereign debt, as well as two major Russian institutions - VEB and PSB. Sberbank and VTB did not appear on the ""sanctions"" list, and their shares immediately rose by more than 7.5%. Gazprom's shares rose 4.2%, even though the sanctions covered the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. At the same time, Biden warned that this is only the ""first package"" of sanctions, and if the situation around Ukraine does not change, it will be followed by another set of restrictions.

> The IMOEX2 index of the Moscow Exchange, which measures the value for the entire trading day, including the extra sessions, soared 4.12% to 3,095 points in 10 minutes.

> The dollar plummeted by 1.2%, or 1.1 ruble. The dollar dropped below 79 rubles - to 78.72 rubles. The ruble also strengthened against the euro, which was traded at 87.82 rubles as of 22:40 Moscow time and lost 1.24%, or 1.21 rubles.

> The euro rate went up above 91 rubles in the morning of February 22 on the Moscow Exchange for the first time since April 2021, according to the trading data on the Moscow Exchange. The reason for the growth was the geopolitical risks associated with the decree of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the recognition of the sovereignty of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, signed the day before.

If the 2 provinces that have been invaded already have been battling with Ukraine for some 8 years now, would it not make sense to just cede those in the first place? I feel like in this day and age if a group, especially one that is concentrated geographically wants to be part of another country, why not just let them? Or are there people living in those provinces that would resist, and not want to be part of Russia?

I'm likely very uneducated about the region, but it seems that if you're battling something since 2014, maybe take a step back and re-evaluate. On the other hand, I know the Russians are unlikely to stop once they annex those 2 provinces.

For example, many people would say France is a nation with a long history, right? In reality, the modern nation of France has only been around since 1780. Prior to the Revolution, France had many unique dialects and ethnic identities. The same could be said of any nation. Italy and Germany were not unified as nations for a very long time, and the Netherlands at one point was ruled by a German-speaking emperor if I'm not mistaken (HRE).

Ethnicism has been an idea for a long time, but the idea of nation states corresponding to this one group in this one place is mostly a modern idea. There's no place on Earth that has had a consistent 100% history all in its borders.

I'm not intimately familiar with Russian/Ukrainian history, I do understand that areas corresponding to European Russia and Ukraine were loosely tied together as the Kievan Rus in the Middle Ages, but these people certainly didn't think of themselves as ""Russian"" or ""Ukrainian"", and likely would have identified more with their immediate geography than some larger homogeneous country. In fact, there were a few East Slavic city states, such as the Novgorod Republic.

In essence, though, thousands of innocent civilians in Ukraine are going to die without good reason.

It’s the same thing every time, on every conservative show, and it’s insane how frequently a simple “if/then” makes someone think they’re working with complex logic, and they’re some kind of galaxy brain if they can come up with a single “if/then/else” breakdown of a situation. As anyone who needs to consider more complex logic would know, basically nothing is that simple unless there’s additional work being done to narrow your options down to two choices.

I’m sure I’ll get some, “what about CNN/MSNBC” nonsense too, but I think all cable news is pretty bad in terms of detrimental oversimplification.

Likely the idea is that they KNOW Russia is trying to create a false pretence by making out that they're the attacking force but if they hold out and the RUSSIANS lose patience and attack them without provocation it makes a huge case not only labelling their opponents as the clear and undeniable aggressors but likely raises the chances that EU or NATO forces might intervene.

Yes it has been said so far that NATO will not get involved BUT I'm wondering how long that line can hold, If Putin just takes the 2 Donbass terrirories and stops there we might see just sanctions but if he tries to make a run on Kiev or the rest of Ukraine I dont know if things will simply stay in the realm of sanctions. Taking the whole of Ukraine is a far bloodier affair and the fallout from it creates far more devastating consequences for everyone.

It does take time to reposition forces to defend for starters (the baltics for example and poland would need reinforcing just incase) but in addition I'm wondering just how long Europe would sit out with a blatantly aggressive Russia on their doorstep. They can't and certainly shouldn't attack Russian Territory itself but the same cannot be said of invading forces inside Ukrainian Territory expecially if they're calling for help as their own people are being slaughtered. Ukraine falling would drive millions of people into Central Europe and I don't think the EU or anyone else can just sit out a conflict that's affecting them expecially after the fallout that was caused by what happened in Syria.

The ultimate problem is just how far is Putin going to go to relive the ""good old days"". ***No one wants this war but him***. One also has to take historical precedent into account too. Hitler was the last one to engage in this kind of carryon nearly a century ago and if he'd been stopped earlier on with Czechoslovakia there and then WW2 may not necessarily have happened or have been far less destructive.

Its entirely likely that future sanctions regimes will ratchet that up to most of the Russian upper class, thats the theories I've seen floating around. More sanctions for defense industries, though those were already hard hit, and sanctions against doing business with anything in the DR/LR region. Again, thought those went through in 2014 but its unsurprising to see. 

The two big moves are the NordStream II decision and the sovereign debt sanction. NordStream II is a major gas pipeline, its cost about $10 billion to build, and mostly the bill has been footed by Russia. Not only is the pipeline a major infrastructure investment, it would have represented HUGE sales to German customers. While the pipeline hasn't been sanctioned, the German government has said basically they wont certify the safety of their end of the pipeline while the crisis is ongoing. This effectively kills the project, not one puff of gas can flow through it till the pipeline has that certificate. If theres a full invasion hopefully it will never happen. Major blow for the Russian petroleum industry, a lot of lost money in both investments and lost sales. The sovereign debt sanction is a formal sanction and is huge. It means no western companies can hold Russian debt bonds and Russian debt cant be sold on any western markets. Russia has partially insulated itself from this, they hold huge reserves of gold, but in the future it will make raising money for any big ticket investments impossible. Debt bonds are the #1 way modern government raise cash, the only other alternative would be to sell some kind of asset. Russian investors can probably carry most short term investments but over the long term this places major stress on the Russian economy. Probably it would make any major domestic spending packages more expensive, and perhaps impossible to actually fund. It seems like a small thing, but put another way Putin has basically already mortgaged the future of the Russian people onto this adventure. So long as the sanctions hold, the Russian people will pay a big share of the costs.

Putin needs to destabilize democracy (everywhere) to maintain power in Russia. The more democracy spreads (and closer to his borders/culture) the more likely his overthrow at home. Ukraine specifically cannot be seen to prosper under democracy by the Russian people, as it effectively is a demonstration of what Russians could expect of their own country if they were given the freedom to elect their own government. Sowing the seeds of separatism, and ""coming to the rescue"" of the separatists shows the Russian people that democracy is a failure and Russia saved them from it.

And I see multiple people asking if a soldiers can phones at the front. As of the last 8 years, yes. I’m not sure how that works day to day. What I think, based on watching hours of frontline tours and stuff on YT, is that they leave their phones where they sleep, and do not have them while on duty in the trenches. It may be different in each unit as well. 

I have no idea if phones will be allowed now since a major re-invasion seems credible at the very least.

I would want to focus on surviving and doing my job. Phones in war can very distracting.

If Ukraine joins NATO, that would allow NATO army bases, missile launchers, anti-missile systems, etc to be right on Russias border.

Russia is slowly taking over Ukraine to prevent that from happening.

Since Ukraine isn’t technically part of NATO yet, the NATO countries might not actually defend Ukraine until a NATO country is directly attacked.

It’s likely that Russia will take over Ukraine and as many non-NATO countries as they can.

From the comments:

>Edit I count 57x t-80u 1x t80uk 1x, mtbl , 1x artillery t72 I can't remember the name of , 1x BMP

>I got another BMP type vehicle near the end of the convoy (2:11 in the vid) and 4x MSTA-S self-propelled howitzers with possibly two more in the distance at the end of the video. Unsure about the latter, but given that Russian artillery batteries are 6 strong it would make sense have that number of vehicles.

>So let's call it 2x tank battalions, 1x artillery battery, and some command and fire control vehicles?

>T-80Us to be specific. Meaning these belong to the 4th Guards Tank Division.

The sanctions on sovereign debt alone would probably have prevented a big project like Nord Stream II from happing in the first place. It will crush Russia's ability to build infrastructure or raise money for major projects in the future. Thats no joke, and is just the first wave in sanctions. Look at North Korea and Iran where harsh sanctions regimes have caused the people there *major* pain. Iran should be as rich as Iraq or the Emirates with as much oil as they have. Theyre not because of US sanctions.

You are right though thats its a long term cost not a short term reprisal. The problem is, what really should the west do? Should American troops move into Kiev and kill Russian soldiers? If the Russian is screaming in the UN about fascists trying once again to destroy the motherland, doesn't it do more harm then good for German troops to surge into Poland? The fact of the matter is the world system isn't set up to stop this kind of situation. In 1991 when Saddam did it, in 1950 when Kim Il Sung did it, the US stepped in and played world police. But people in the US and around the world dont *want* the USA to play cop any more. Especially when it risks a nuclear war.

The fact of the matter is if Russia wants Ukraine its theirs. At this point only God could keep Putin from taking it if he really wanted to.

>“The Leer-3 UAV can effectively turn into a ‘virtual cellular station’ by sending messages and totally controlling a subscriber’s devices once it replaces a base station,” according to the U.S. Army’s Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO), which translates Russian media reports. “If it manages to take the place of a cellular communications tower, it can also send audio messages and small video clips to subscribers.”

The Leer-3 RB-341V was used in Syria to send instant messages to rebel factions, containing application forms for an armistice, said Lt. Gen. Sergey Kuralenko, the Chief of the Center for the Reconciliation of the Opposing Sides in Syria.

>“It thus appears to have some psychological warfare mission implications, if it can do all of these tasks,” the FMSO notes. “The Leer-3 can reportedly block enemy mobile telephones while simultaneously not impeding the operation of friendly mobiles phones. The systems can collect telephone numbers and call these numbers while blocking other people’s signals. It may also be able to remotely connect user devices as well.”

People protesting measures, people protesting the care free attitude. The Russian government's handling of the situation has been piss poor, and such as a popular will exists in Russia and can be expressed its turned against Putin. You might think thats nothing, but keep in mind what caused the 1917 revolution which kicked out the Tsar. People were cooped up inside for months thanks to bad snow, they came outside and realized the war was still going on and things still sucked, and they got roped in to protesting by a small group of radicals. By the time anyone outside the city knew what was happening it was too late. This is a doomsday scenario for Putin. And so hes turned to the same move he always turns to, a foreign adventure. Time to pull the iron out of the Ukrainian fire. The problem was he got caught, and well before he was ready to move. If wed only just found out about this two weeks ago things would have been very different. But instead the west has had time to prepare to smash Putin's dick when he does the thing, and now he cant do the thing because the whole point was to make him look tough in the first place. 

Its my belief that the big delay weve seen from the first chess move to the last is the result of Putin realizing that A) he cant back down and B) he cant stop with just taking over the contested oblasts.

> BUCK: Mr. President, in the last 24 hours we know Russia has said that they are recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine, and now this White House is stating that this is an “invasion.” That’s a strong word. What went wrong here? What has the current occupant of the Oval Office done that he could have done differently?

> PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn’t be there and a man that has no concept of what he’s doing. I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, “This is genius.” Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful.

> So, Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.

> By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy.

I still dont think so, at least in the near future, I think he is playing a cold war game, measuring reactions, etc, if that was his main plan, I think he wouldve done it already instead of stalling and playing the propaganda game. I think his current moves are seeds he is planting for the future.

Massive sanctions, increase NATO pressence and troops around Ukraine, and find ways to try to protect the countries you mention.

If that's true it's a bit stupid Putin waited until the end of the Trump Administration to make a move.

With Trump ""on"" their side he'd have it way easier than now, right? So if it was an opportunistic move on Ukraine, why wait until the Democrats are all gun-oh about playing ""world-police"". Not saying I dislike Biden or anything. But from an outsider perspective, Republicans look less of warmongers than the Democrats... Like I was shocked to learn that Obama got a Nobel Peace prize while he was one the most interventionist president the US ever had.

Anyway back to the topic.

My question is : Does Putin genuinely thinks he's acting in ""self defense"" against NATO with Ukraine trying to join? Because, IMO really looks like it.

Not pushing any narrative here. But I'm seriously puzzled by that thought because it's even more terrifying.

All he said about ""You want to see decomunization?! Oh I'll give you decomunization MFkers!"" (Not verbatim but felt like it).

From a previous comment of mine about Nato red tape:

Thing is, Nato and red tape has been put in place precisely to better protect Europe from what happened in WW1 and 2. Chamberlain's policy of appeasement that led to Hitler being emboldened in his land grabs in Europe would have been impossible if he was restricted in his concessions to Hitler by proper unified policy.

Sure it seems clunky and unhelpful (to Ukraine especially right now), but we know where the red line is, and Putin knows.

If Hitler had a firm defense pact (and not the mutual defense pacts that was basically governed by the participants themselves) he would have not gotten as far as he had before war was triggered.

The entire reason England and France declared war in Sept 1939 was because their defensive pact with Poland did not offer either of them an out, and they had to honor their commitments regardless.

Nato is there to stop another Hitler, Putin is doing the small land grabs on countries to stop them from joining nato (there is a clause that you cannot join Nato if you have an active,ongoing or unresolved border or territorial dispute.). Georgia, Moldova (where they have Transnistria as a breakaway republic under effective Russian control) and lately Ukrain are all examples of this.

They form a neglected and bitter region of Ukraine that is willing to take a chance at a better life in Russia. Basically no Western nation supports the right to self-determination within their own borders either. 

>As a Brit, there are a lot of areas we could (should?) 

The fact you are not confident that you *should*, kind of speaks to your own bias - just as Russia will be biased in their point of view. Maybe according to Russia, Ukraine should return all the lands that Russia allowed them to historically incorporate? 
Governments including Ukraine's care more about the land underneath and the lines on a map than the people living there and what they want and who they identify as. 

Borders will always be changing. I don't understand why people seem to think that since WW2, borders would never change or be adjusted again? As if we would all really stop fighting over history and resources? 

It seems the only thing that is true that gives a nation the right to exist in the history books is *power*. Without power - without the ability to defend oneself or retaliate in kind, a country is not really sovereign when facing against a much more powerful society. If one doesn't have a lot of power then they must combine numerous small powers into an alliance. Ukraine has no allies. They are right, in hindsight, they should never have given up WMDs, but then that is a cost and an additional risk that the world collectively should not have to bear because the U.S/NATO are unwilling to resolve the issue by compromise.

This is and has always been about the U.S and creeping NATO towards Russia's border to geopolitically and economically isolate them, so that their society fundamentally collapses and no longer poses the threat to the U.S. that the American government perceives it to, as well as the authoritarian challenge over Europe. They have a red scare obsession that they cannot let go, even though the red of the iron curtain has long faded. It is why Ukraine knows there is no purpose in communicating with Russia, and Russia will only accept dialogue and agreement lead by the U.S and expects all of Europe to fall in line behind the U.S' decision. 

In terms of the overarching argument, the territorial integrity of Ukraine is ""a small thing"", when we are talking about the a continuation of the ideological and geopolitical conflict between the USSR and USA. The Cold War never ended as ideology around the USSR and the West never went away either. 

America could as a member of NATO and the most powerful military far above Western Europe, unilaterally declare that they will never accept Ukrainian membership in NATO. If that did not guarantee ongoing peace for Ukraine and Europe, and satisfy Putin, then they would have nothing to lose by reneging on the agreement should Russia have invaded in spite of a halt to NATO expansion. 

America couldn't accept Soviet missiles on Cuba, why would Russia accept American missiles in NATO Ukraine? Why would China see an American victory in North Korea and simply look the other way? 

American governments live in fear of Russian power every decade, but you don't expect Russians to fear American power projection?  

Propaganda is a justification, a casus belli. It's not a reason for doing things or the motivation. It seems that you cannot look beyond the propaganda at all to read between the lines. Russia has its own perspective of the world and it is no less correct than the American perspective, or the Chinese perspective. Like America, every country in the world will exercise its perspective whether or not you agree with it. 

There's no right or wrong here, just like all of history. These tensions and the perspectives and motivations behind them are nothing new in civilisation. It is just history over and over again. 

The only thing that changes and brings lasting peace, are those seemingly large policy decisions that are really quite small compromises of ego on the level of societies and rulers. In 15-20 years, every major political player in this current game will be deceased of old age, but the civilisation they lead and leave behind will endure for hundreds, thousands of years with their decisions as lasting consequences.

That's true. How does this help us to achieve that? Let's say Putin doesn't *further* invade and annexes another portion of Ukraine, how does that help the US in a year? Ten years? 

>Also you aren't selling weapons to ukraine. You're selling weapons to your NATO allies and you're hoping they'll increase defense contribution.

Maybe, but how much money do you think that is? The majority of NATO spending is US money. The next largest contribution is the UK and France, both of which have their own very significant defense industries. UK companies almost certainly sell more to the US government than the other way around. 

So we're talking a net increase in sales by US companies per year of what? $5B? $10B? We have a $23000B economy. These are not significant numbers. It's a rounding error.

They’d have used it against equipment depots, rear areas and troops where it was worth doing and the threat of immediate retaliation was  low. You could argue the threat of retaliation here is low, and that you could cause mass casualties if the Ukrainians aren’t in a protective posture - although I find it hard to believe that equipment deliveries to the Ukrainians didn’t involve protective gear if there’s even the slightest hint of chemical arms being used. However, the Soviets would have been extremely selective about using those weapons. The benefit has to outweigh the cost. In this case, you’re using WMDs against people you’re hoping will soon fall into your sphere of influence, and may contaminate those areas for years to come. You will also be advancing into the chemical environment you just created, and your own effectiveness is reduced by the need for protection. If the Ukrainians are protected, the use of chemical arms will slow down the attacker giving more time to the defender. They are also weather dependent for effectiveness, and cannot be used in close proximity to friendly areas. Furthermore, a first strike using chemical arms in this sort of setting guarantees a NATO response. Whether militarily or otherwise, they would not take that lying down. 

There were uses of chemical arms in Syria, almost for sure though. And if the Russians thought there was a reason to use them again in Ukraine then I have no doubt they would. But there is no reason to do so. It gains them almost nothing, especially if used on a very minor basis to limit observation.

5 days ago, Biden said he was convinced Putin would invade ""within the next *few* days"". I think we can assume that Putin will wait for at least tomorrow (diplomatic staff doesn't seem to be out yet, and it is already relatively late in the day, and he doesn't even have troops in the occupied regions, at least not on a noticeable level). ""a few days"" is  typically not 6 days (minimum), cause you would then say ""within a week"".

I will give one more thought, though:  It's not about any one antagonistic state being strong (especially not militarily), but rather a new anti-NATO type of arrangement about 'defensive' security and economic agreements.

For example:  Iran and/or Russia and/or Venezuela giving China sweetheart oil/gas deals in exchange for Chinese production output being redirected away from the US and towards them.  It would be a significant boost to their economies and a huge hit to ours.

So, we're kind of in a hole, here.  We're *kind* of in a hole.  Not entirely - but we have to be willing to break apart some old antagonistic relationships we have, and that unfortunately may require sacrifices that aren't pleasant or even possible.

That's normally what happens in lots of these situations. A country strays into hostile airspace or territorial waters and the other reacts. Its difficult to say exactly which side of a border the attack happened and both sides get to justify their following actions. The country that got shot down/attacked claims they were in neutral territory and there was no provocation and the attacker gets to say they were defending their territory/enforcing a no-go zone

Its not like it happened over night,first of those separated regions clamed theirs independents 8 years ago. It took years prior to that for them to slowly shape it as independant,one by one step remove official Ukrainian institutions and so on. And it took years of effort after 2014 to make them strong enough and finish the deal of recognising them(for example since 2017 russian goveremnt is recognising and exepting brith/dead sertificates, whiacle plates and other official documents issued by goverment of ""independant regions""). Gess what currency they are using? Ukrainian? More like Russian ruble. You see what am i saying? 5 years prior to this date your birth certificat is not issued by ukrainain goverment but by the government of unrecognised country and is accepted as official russian document.

Is it propaganda still?

That is what a mean when i say it is so sad to see the amount of histera shaped opinion here and mostly buy younger so called educated people. 

The good parallel to this is Kosovo*. You can downvote all you want. It took years of western propaganda to shape the public opinion and make it acceptable to happen.

Kosovo gained independence in 2008 but it was independent years prior to that. It is the fact.

For example:

Years and years of ethically cleaning the region,silencly accepted and supported by Nato and usa,shaping western public opinion. And when the right time came it was pretty easy to claim independence and wave usa flags there.

It would make sense that they have the most to say.

They called the troop buildup, 

they called that the ""withdrawal of forces"" that Putin said was happening was bullshit

they called the false flag attacks (car bomb, genocide claims, shelling of civilians by Ukraine)

they called Russian cyber attacks shutting down the internet in Ukraine

they called Russia recognizing those regions as independent

and they called Russia moving it's forces into those regions

And they're going to be right about Putin invading Ukraine at large.

To answer your question shortly, yes and I think he has made the simple calculation that we won't do any of the things that I've listed. It would be a fair bet by him, frankly, considering the lack of Western outcry over his prior invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and even the invasion of Georgia in 2008. 

Let's prove him wrong. It may change the calculus in Moscow when all those Billionaire Oligarchs mistresses can't go to Ibiza and kids get booted from Oxford.

To some of your other points: 

>could backfire very heavily on europe (and us) economy, and we are probably not ready to take such a hit.

If the Russian economy (which is roughly the size of Italy's) might survive these transactions than the combined economic might of the entire EU plus AUKUS, South Korea, Japan, etc. would easily weather the storm. 

>while EU is totally unprepared even just for energy supply

That can be mitigated. The US is already preparing [to do so.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-31/u-s-looks-to-qatar-in-case-europe-s-gas-supplies-run-low) 

>They can supply Ukraine but Russia having the second-third (given China is largely untested and only very large in number) best military in the world, they stand little to no chance even if supplied by NATO if Russia goes for full scale invasion.

The US was more than capable of supplying and bankrolling the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and turning the place into a nightmare for the Red Army in the 80's.
