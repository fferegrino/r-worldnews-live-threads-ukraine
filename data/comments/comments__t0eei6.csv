Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It’s a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

**Boris Johnson statement key points:**

- End Europe's dependence on gas. Welcomes Scholz's decision of ending Nordstream 2.

- Full asset freeze on VTB.

- New powers can exclude Russian banks from UK banking system completely (inlc. clearing payments and accessing sterling). United States will take similar approach.

- Ban Russian state and private powers from acquiring funds in UK, loans.

- Limit amount of money Russian nationals can deposit.

- Sanctions coming for Belarus.

- More than 100+ companies and businesses having assets froze.

- Aeroflot being banned from UK.

- Will be enacting similar trade restrictions to Russia. Will be banning 'dual-use items' - electronic and telecommunicatory items will not be shipped there.

- New 'kleptocracy' branch of NCA to investigate Asian-Russian oligarchs.

- Cutting out of SWIFT is not off table, but needs unity of other G7 members. Seems to have staken a step back from earlier saying they need to be cut out?

- Stocks in Russian Index down 45%, wiping off **$250,000,000,000** of wealth. Rubel down to record lows against dollar. 

- Strengthen NATO. Meeting of NATO's leaders tomorrow.

- Appeal to people of Russians. Shames the horror being done in their name.",1645723120.0,1645722710.0,t3_t0eei6,t3_t0eei6,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Russia’s social influence campaigns are often intended to demoralize westerners and create social division by propagating inaccurate, hateful messaging on social issues, and also by attempting to undermine public perception and support for alliances between western nations. Here we also see them making efforts to exaggerate Russian victories over Ukraine to demoralize and reduce support for Ukraine’s position. Don’t fall for it, it’s just part of their adversarial strategy and information warfare. Here are some great resources with documented evidence as proof:

More US military assets will arrive in eastern European countries today, senior US defense official says
From CNN's Ellie Kaufman and Barbara Starr
More US military assets will arrive in Eastern European countries later today, a senior defense official told reporters on Thursday.

Six F-35s will arrive in Estonia, Lithuania and Romania today — two to each country — the official said. 

The group of attack helicopters “are on their way,” the official said, but noted there’s been “some weather issues” to get them to their locations. “We still expect those Apaches to get on site later today,” the official said.

On Tuesday, President Biden announced more US military assets would be deployed to NATO allies in Eastern Europe.  

That announcement included the movement of up to eight F-35 strike fighters from Germany to other Eastern European nations along NATO’s eastern flank, 20 AH-64 helicopters from Germany to the Baltic region and 12 AH-64 helicopters moved from Greece to Poland, a senior defense official said Tuesday.

“US troops remain outside of Ukraine,” the official added.

EU leaders will call for sanctions against Belarus for its role in supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a leaked summit text.

A draft statement seen by the Guardian, to be finalised by EU leaders meeting later on Thursday night, condemns “the involvement of Belarus in this aggression against Ukraine” and calls on Minsk to abide by its international obligations.

The document states:

The European Council [of EU leaders] calls for the swift preparation of a further sanctions package that will also cover Belarus.

Belarus is already subject to EU sanctions, targeting individuals and sectors of its economy, following President Alexander Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters in 2020.

The draft text repeats EU warnings that Russia will be hit with further sanctions that “impose massive and severe consequences” - but does not spell out what those measures are. That has to agreed by the EU’s 27 leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday evening.

ec1eae5fe7a19a5d0da9f3c1b4a3dfe6,t0eei6,hy9f4bx,"Ukranian President addresses Russian citizens.

I would like to address the citizens of Russia directly, not as president, but as a citizen of Ukraine, and I address the citizens of Russia as I would the citizens of Ukraine. We share a more than 2000 kilometer border. Your soldiers are stationed all along it, almost two hundred thousand soldiers, and thousands of military vehicles. Your leaders have chosen for them to take a step forward and into the territory of another country. And that single step could be the beginning of a great war on the European continent.  
  
The whole world speaks of what could happen day to day. A cause for war could arise at any moment. Any provocation, any incident, could be the flare of a fire that burns everything.  
  
You have been told that this flame will bring liberation to Ukraine’s people. But the Ukrainian people are free. They remember their own past and will build their own future. They build, they do not destroy, as they themselves have told you day after day on television. The Ukraine in your news and the Ukraine of real life are two entirely different places, and the difference is that the latter is real.  
  
They tell you that we’re Nazis. But how can a people that lost eight million lives to defeat the Nazis support Nazism? How can I be a Nazi? Say it to my grandfather, who fought in World War II as a Soviet infantryman and died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. They tell you that we hate Russian culture. How can one hate a culture? Any culture? Neighbors always enrich each other’s cultures. However, we are not part of one whole. You cannot swallow us up. We are different. But this difference is not a reason for enmity. We want to determine our own course and build our own history: peacefully, calmly, and honestly.  
  
They told you that I would order an attack on the Donbas, order indiscriminate shootings and bombings. This leads to some questions – some very simple ones. Who are we shooting at? What are we bombing? Donetsk, which I have visited dozens of times? Where I looked in people’s faces, in their eyes? Artyoma Street, where I strolled with friends? The Donbas Arena, where I rooted for our boys together with Ukrainian lads at the European Championships? Shcherbakov Park, where I drank with friends when our boys lost? Luhansk? Where the mother of my best friend is buried? Where his father also rests? Take note, that I am speaking to you all in Russian now, but no one in Russia knows the meaning of these places, these streets, these names, these events. These are all alien to you, unfamiliar.  
  
This is our land, and this is our history. What will you fight for and with whom? Many of you have visited Ukraine. Many of you have relatives here. Some might have studied at Ukrainian universities, and befriended Ukrainians. You know our character, you know our people, and you know our principles. You know what we value. So stop and listen to yourselves, to the voice of reason, to the voice of common sense.  
  
Hear us. The Ukrainian people want peace, as does their government. Not only do they want it, they demonstrate that desire for peace. They do everything they can. We are not alone: it is the truth that Ukraine is supported by many nations. Why? It is not about peace at any cost. It is about peace and principles, of justice, of international law. It is about the right to self-determination, that every person might determine their own future. It is the right of every society, and of every person, to security, to a life without threats. I am certain that these rights are important to you, as well.  
  
The truth is that this needs to end before it is too late. If Russia’s leadership does not want to meet us across the table for the sake of peace, perhaps it will sit at that table with you. Do you Russians want a war? I would very much like to know the answer, but that answer depends only on you, on the citizens of the Russian Federation.

Johnson says the UK is announcing the largest package of sanctions that Russia has ever seen.  
A full asset freeze is being imposed on VBT, Russia’s second largest bank.  
Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system, he says.  
Russsian state and private companies will be banned from raising money in the UK.  
The amount of money Russians can have in British bank accounts will be limited.  
Sanctions will apply to Belarus too, Johnson says.  
He says Aeroflot will be banned in the UK.  
Export controls will be implemented, similar to the ones imposed by the US. (That means a ban on items like semiconductor and other high-tech equipment.)  
There will also be a ban on the export of dual-use items to Russia. (That means equipment that could be used militarily.)  
Legislation to enforce some of these sanctions will be laid in parliament next week, he says.

Not really, or at least not yet. Since 2014, the Bank of Russia has run its own financial messaging system for Russian and foreign banks. But that one has only about 400 users. The People’s Bank of China in 2021 announced a joint venture with Swift that was seen in some quarters as an insurance policy against being cut off from the global financial system. One fear among Western officials is that banning countries from Swift would encourage the use of such alternatives. Digital currencies and the underlying technology have also been touted as a threat to Swift for several years, but they’re nowhere close to replacing it.

NATO also provides the protection that affords nuclear countries, it prevents them from being the site of proxy wars, and creates a place for smaller countries to have a stronger voice on the world stage.

To address the point former President Trump made about US spending in NATO. The US could just cut part of their own military budget instead. The US military spending is so high because the US wants autonomy to fight what wars it wants without having to worry about NATO backing them. This is a bad idea and our 20 year war in the middle east should be proof of the failings of our military industrial complex.

A country cut off from Swift can suffer significant economic pain. That’s what happened to Iran in 2012, when its banks lost access to Swift as part of European Union sanctions targeting the country’s nuclear program and its sources of finance. (Many of the banks were reconnected in 2016 after the EU took them off its sanctions list.) When Western nations threatened Russia’s access to Swift in 2014, Alexei Kudrin, a onetime finance minister close to President Vladimir Putin, estimated that it could reduce Russia’s gross domestic product by 5% in a year. Cutting Russia off from Swift could have ramifications for other nations as well, since Russia is a key energy supplier to Europe and countries rely on the Swift system to pay for fuel. Russian officials have repeatedly denied assertions that they intend to invade Ukraine.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

proof that you no longer need visa:

Think of Swift, an acronym for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, as the Gmail of global banking. It delivers secure messages among more than 11,000 financial institutions and companies, in over 200 countries and territories. The message traffic -- 42 million a day on average last year -- includes orders and confirmations for payments, trades and currency exchanges. The member-owned cooperative, based just outside Brussels, was founded in 1973 to end reliance on the telex system.

It would seem in addition to the helo assaults from likely the 31st and possibly 45th airborne brigades, the 76th airborne division is about to do a paradrop from Pskov:

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

- China can keep Russia afloat. Our sanctions would essentially only shift Russia's money flow. 

- We don't have the power to impose sanctions on China without a much heavier backlash.

- Russia wouldn't risk so much just to claim Ukraine as their territory. The gain to risk ratio is way too low here. Putin is an asshole but not stupid. It is very likely that this is the beginning of Russia/China collectively expanding their territorial power. Fair to assume that Ukraine won't be the last victim of a nonviolent NATO. Next on the list is Taiwan or other Baltic nations. 

- A nuclear war is nonsensical for Russia and China, especially China is not in a very desperate situation to justify risking it all. They don't want a nuclear war just as much as we do but we are more open about our fear of the consequences and they realize that. They use our fear against us. 

- Our inabiliy to overcome this fear and to call their bluff of a nuclear war will enable them to gain control over any country they want because just like  with Nazi Germany: Sanctions don't stop a war machine. 

I don't know if we have lived in peace for too long but it seems like most Europeans still don't want to accept that WW3 is becoming inevitable. Instead we seem to favor the idea of losing more power with each new lost territory until it is too late.

Somehow we have convinced ourselves that Putin is just being petty and that there is no reason to suspect a bigger plan despite the huge risk for Russia.

Ukraine is divided close to half and half with Ukrainians and Russians (east and west) but both would prefer to keep Ukraine Ukraine.

Preface) Yes, Putin is a mentally degraded old man and this decision is probably a result of that. 


1) we called our relatives in Dnepropetrovsk last night and they said we are freaking out about this invasion more than they are. They are not running for cover and currently have no plans to leave home 


2) a lot of Eastern Ukrainians would rather live under a Putin puppet than a Western puppet. They have been speaking mostly Russian since pre-soviet times and identify more with Russian culture. My family is pretty much all from central/eastern Ukraine as far as anyone can remember (we even have a town named after our family) and most of us can't speak pprperly pure Ukrainian. Our ""at home"" language is a mix of Russian and Ukrainian that would get us bullied by both groups. But we can speak Russian easily because of Soviet mandates to learn it, so it's easier to fit in with a Russian system. 

3)Eastern Ukrainians would be second class citizens under a Western Ukrainian government. This was already somewhat the case after the 2014 totally-not-CIA-backed revolution. For Americans, imagine if suddenly Great Britain controlled your country and you wouldn't get served at restaurants and your grades at school would suffer unless you could pull off a perfect British accent. Except it's worse because Ukrainian and Russian are far more different and have completely different words for ~40% of things.   

 
4) I don't get why reddit seems to see Western Ukraine as some bastion of LGBT rights, they are far more right wing and socially conservative that Eastern Ukraine. I think in general, ~80% of Ukrainians in general would love nothing more than to put all gay people on a small island somewhere and nuke it. Also, Azov Battalion are not real Nazis. Fake group created to channel right wing Ukrainian sentiment in a pro-Western direction.


Maybe there are some neutral parties who can genuinely benefit from this perspective. Don't fall for your own side's propaganda.

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that fake news was spreading (most likely trolls supported by Russia), that the Polish border was closed.

This is a lie.

If you are looking for asylum - go to the Polish border. We are ready for your arrival. There are reception points at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal assistance.

The Polish government has launched a special website to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know someone who is currently seeking help.

EDIT: YOU DO NOT NEED A VISA TO CROSS THE POLISH BORDER. EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS A PASSPORT. VISA SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME !!!!!!

EDIT2: as proof that you no longer need a visa:

Having nukes isn’t an IWIN button.  It’s a “don’t threaten my right to exist” button.

Many NATO nations also have nukes.  Russia can only use a nuke if they are willing to be erased from the history of the planet along with billions of other people.

You don’t do that just because you lose a foreign conflict. You do that when your existence is about to be terminated.  

Putin saying he’d use nukes if NATO moved in to repel him in Ukraine is bullshit.  He would only do it if NATO against Russian soil.  

Despite that, NATO isn’t going into Ukraine directly because it’s not worth it (to NATO) to sacrifice the lives of it’s own people to save the lives of Ukrainians.  It’s sad, but it is what it is.  It has nothing to do with Putin’s bullshit bluff of using nukes.

MAD is the principle that one nuclear power physically attacking another nuclear power is a death sentence for the world. If Russia attacks a NATO member, the terms of the alliance require everyone else to intervene and aid that country, including the nuclear powers. That would do one of two things.

A) Trigger MAD and destroy life on Earth.

Or

B) Force the nuclear powers to blink, not intervene, and prove that NATO is a hollow promise.

But B would require the US, France, and UK to all back down together. If even one did anything it would have to be interpreted as action from the whole alliance.

They also have nearly 1000 other soviet era tanks in theory are part of their military but the reality is they are 40+ years old without any revisions or elaborate maintenance, and probably not terribly relevant to war if they still work properly.

Ukraine also has a very robust anti-infantry vehicle program. They restored over 1000 BMP-2s in just the last few years. They're fast little tracked ""cars"" with guns made to break up infantry positions and shoot at people. Also a lot of little armored personnel carriers.

Because they inherited a chunk of the soviet union they have always had equipment. They are far from a top-class military, but they have a lot of outdated but still functional equipment.

They also have well over 1000 stationary guns, etc. -- no clue if they will try to use those to fire at incoming Russians. Most likely, that type of weaponry is a little too outdated for a war in 2022. Russian tanks have effective ranges of 8000 meters(5 miles) so sitting in a traditional ground mounted gun and trying to shoot at oncoming Russians is basically a death sentence.

Ok, after years of warnings were ignored and hearing ""Garry, you were right!"" all damn day today, I'll repeat what I said in 2014: Stop telling me I was right and listen to what I'm saying now. My recommendations follow: 1/5

-Support Ukraine militarily, immediately, everything but boots on the ground. All weapons, intel, cyber.

-Bankrupt Putin's war machine. Freeze & seize Russia's finances & those of him and his gang.
-Kick Russia out of every intl & financial institution. PACE, Interpol, etc 2/5

-Recall all ambassadors from Russia. There is no point in talking. The new unified message is ""stop or be isolated completely"".
-Ban all elements of Putin's global propaganda machine. Turn them off, shut them down, send them home. Stop helping the dictator spread lies & hate.
3/5

-Expose and act against Putin's lackeys in the free world. If Schröder and his ilk continue to work for Putin, bring charges. Ask the owners & advertisers of networks platforming Putin propagandists like Carlson why they allow it. 4/5

-Replace Russian oil & gas. Pressure OPEC, increase production, reopen Keystone. You can't save the planet if you don't save the people on it.
-Acknowledge there will be costs, sacrifices. We waited to long, the price is high, but it will only get higher. It's time to fight. 5/5",False,1645719572.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hy99g6o,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Ukraine does not have the military to win in a conventional head to head war against Russia, and Russia can easily destroy Ukraine's major cities without ever stepping foot near them using air strikes and artillery.

Ukraine's play is to stay dormant and wait for Russia to bring their infantry and armor into whatever is left of the City and attack them there.  Urban environments are hell for invaders because the defenders can hide all over the place.  Some Russian armor lacks the ability to point their weapons high above so RPG teams can shoot down on them where their armor is the weakest.  Snipers and machine gunners can also take advantage of this complicated environment easily.  
Roads act as extended bottlenecks and killing fields. You've also got sewer systems underground most cities defenders can utilize to move underground.  It's truly a 360 degree environment.

The defenders can stay close enough to Russian forces and make it nearly impossible to call in artillery or air support without killing Russian forces, or defenders can withdrawal quickly after an ambush through the urban environment.

If you paid attention to what Ukraine's allies equipped Ukraine with they are trying to optimize this strategy.  Instead of large emplacements that could be easily destroyed by artillery/air, it was small arms and shoulder carried anti tank weapons that can be dispersed all over the Country and hidden easily.

From there Ukraine just needs to grind Russia down into a war of attrition.  This could truly be a living hell for everyone involved.",False,1645721367.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hy98xy2,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

He *is not* a dictator, but he certainly wants to be one. He *already* wanted to put troops on the Mexican border (something some other Republicans support in the future, see Rick Scott's latest plan) and is praising Putin's moves. It's the exact same justification as his taxes: ""of course it's not right to do it, but it would be dumb not to if no one stops you"". 

When Trump wins in 2024, he will send troops right up to the border, then watch for Mexico to bend over backwards committing human rights abuses on asylees to stop the flow of migrants into America, lest Trump send some troops across solely for peacekeeping.

Crimea was annexed in 2014, they have been showing signs for months of likely taking the resisting territories...having Ukraine join NATO would have been a simple way to get war off of their doorstep. Much like Taiwan and China, Russia genuinely believes Ukraine belongs to them and was never a legitimate separate country. It was only a matter of time. Putin really wants Kharkov for the historical value and Kiev for the economic value. Kharkov is a heroic site of his ancestors great battles...Russians are very nostalgic people as a whole and the separation of the ""great Russian empire"" is considered a tragedy among many Russian oligarchs including Putin.

Putin has been trying to sow instability in Ukraine so they would fail of their own devices for 20 years. They were unstable and near failing for over a decade and he probably assumed he would get them easy...then they have been getting progressively stronger since the 2010s. He was going to decide soon that it was time to take them either way. He wants part of his legacy to be reuniting the Russian Empire. That has been one of his primary goals for the last 20 years. He's about to turn 70 years old and he is mortally terrified of COVID-19 -- his time of playing waiting games is probably over so he is trying to reunite what he sees as ""Russia"" as long as he doesn't step on NATO feet.

1. Create a HUGE flood of people leaving the country

2. Formerly rich people would be far less wealthy (possibly even poor), meaning that they would rely on Russian public services/charities. By routing resources to those people, the government wouldn't be able to use those resources on other things, like the military or infrastructure. The government would either have to spend more money they don't have to keep things leveled out (think: massive bailouts that the general public hate), or things would start to get worse overall until the average quality of life starts tanking.

3. Citizens remember being hurt, so when Putin dies and there's even the tiniest chance that an election might be somewhere in the neighborhood of potentially not totally corrupt (doubtful as that is in Russia), the citizens might be more willing to vote for someone with zero ties to Putin and his regime.

Punishing the citizens of Russia could have plenty of good outcomes for the rest of the world and even for the long-term future of Russia.

This would be the ideal time for US cyber operations to give back some of the love Russians have been sending our way. 

Destroying their internal infrastructure via cyber attacks would put Putin at an overwhelming disadvantage while the Russian markets are capsizing, they are possibly being removed from SWIFT and trying to navigate a full on assault while Ukrainians are feverishly ready to fight tooth and nail for their freedom.

While it’s still risky I would imagine US Intelligence is frothing at the mouth at the idea that they could significantly cause harm to Russia long term in the midst of this chaos, effectively destroying one of their major enemies for generations to come.

All of that is not to mention the millions upon millions of activist hackers that now see a massive target on the backs of Russia and have a moral reason to try and destroy every system they can penetrate. It just became open season and Russia is about to get hunted on every front imaginable

Edit 3 hours later - NBC news just confirmed Biden is considering unprecedented Cyber Attacks to disrupt Russian operations as well as attacks on infrastructure.

It's like if there was a big crime in my city and ALL the police were flocking to the other side of town and I was like, ""This is the prime opportunity to rob a bank."" 

Yeah. True. Except I don't know how to rob a bank. I'm not even sure where the nearest bank is. I don't have a gun or an escape plan or a getaway driver. It's just not feasible. 

They literally do not have the capability to do it right now. You do not launch a snap invasion of the size necessary to take Taiwan on a ""Oh. Today would be a good day."" whim. 

I recently read a great book called ""The Chinese Invasion Threat: Taiwans Defense and American Strategy in Asia"" that thoroughly and exhaustively war games out what a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would look like. Early on, it makes the point that the US had actually prepared detailed plans for an Invasion of Japanese held Taiwan late in WW2. It was obviously never carried out but the planning had been robust. A summary of the American thoughts on the issue:

""The plan for the assault on Formosa was codenamed: Operation Causeway. It envisioned an attack with 300,000 Soldiers and 100,000 Marines augmented by 4,000 ships and 2,000 aircraft. It was envisioned as a massive combined assault on Taiwans southwestern coast, centered on the large beachfront at what is today Fangliao Township. The total estimated number of engaged American forces was anticipated to need to be somewhere around 500,000 and would take at least 3 months. The American Military estimated they would suffer approximately 150,000 casualties to root out the estimated 100,000 Japanese defenders.""

The book goes on to note that 1) The United States Military at the time was the most seasoned and capable amphibious assault force in the world with massive and extensive experience carrying out said operations all across the world and was supported by the largest Navy the world has ever seen which included 13 Fleet Carriers and over 30 Light Carriers as well as a massive amount of supporting aircraft. The Chinese Military is nowhere near as well equipped or experienced with amphibious operations. 2) The Japanese Force defending the island (100,000 Troops) is significantly smaller than the ROC Armed Forces.... which have somewhere around 160,000 on active duty and 1.6 million in the reserves, most of which would be quickly activated in war time and likely would already have been activated during the Chinese build up that would have to preface any invasion. So given all of that... How good are the Chinese odds, honestly?

The full book lays out the hypothetical ""invasion"" in detail (it only games out a PRC vs ROC scenario although it does talk extensively about the possibility of US involvement) and the big take away...

This would be an incredibly difficult, perhaps impossible, operation for the Chinese. Even without US involvement.

They have made none of the preparations necessary and it would be tantamount to geopolitical suicide to just snap this one into action on a 'convenient' whim. It's not going to happen. Period.",False,1645723041.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hy9hxkt,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Cut Russia off from SWIFT, the global electronic financial transaction system. Permanently kill Nordstream 2. Prohibiting Russian state banks from doing business with any Western institution.

Emplace significant export controls on areas that the Russian economy is reliant on (like semiconductors and other technology) that the West has a monopoly on.

Put large numbers of NATO Troops in every Eastern and Southeastern European NATO ally, as those countries have requested.

Increase the supply of military supplies to Ukraine. Contribute financially to Ukrainian stability (maybe even using some of those seized assets.)

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

1st iraq war is probably what the international community ought to be doing now. think about it... if kuwait was worth a gigantic international coalition to liberate from (at the time) the world's 4th largest army, why wouldn't this apply to apply to a fledgling democracy in ukraine?  kuwait was hardly an open and shut case.. iraq's contention that  kuwait was stealing iraqi oil had merit, and what i read about the creation of kuwait was that some arbitrary rich people decided they wanted their little city/enclave to be independent simply because it'd mean they would be richer.

So that when the Russian forces inevitably invade Ukraine, they will metaphorically (or perhaps quite literally, i’m not familiar with the geography of the Poland/Ukraine border area) see US troops standing at the ready. I’m like 99.9% sure this troop movement is purely a deterrent idea. It’s America’s way of telling Putin that they realize he found a loophole of sorts by invading a non-NATO country and therefore NATO will not get involved. But the US and NATO are watching VERY closely and Putin must be sure that he doesn’t even step 1 inch out of bounds here.

It’s also a deterrent for however Russia inevitably responds to NATO sanctions. Technically speaking, cyber attacks on a NATO country can be considered an act of war under the NATO alliance. And we are all aware of Russia’s cyber attack capabilities at this point. So if Russia were to say, hack and shut down the US internet, that could technically be considered an act of war on a NATO country. And NATO troops are RIGHT there on the border ready to go if Putin gives them a reason.

Now to be fair, the whole “cyber-attack being considered an act of war” thing is a blurred line that we haven’t really seen happen under serious circumstances like this. So it’s unclear how exactly NATO would respond to cyber attacks from Russia. I don’t actually think the US or NATO would seriously consider sending in troops to fight Russia if Russia shut down a NATO country’s internet for a few hours. But, if the cyber attack were to do any significant damage to a NATO country’s energy distribution system for example, that may be a different story. So again, having US/NATO troops on the Poland/Ukraine border provides a very strong and constant reminder to Putin that he must tread VERY carefully throughout this entire situation.",1645721312.0,1645721073.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hy9a7kf,,3,28,0,28,0,0,

Russian President Vladimir Putin is offering talks to Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky after Russian forces attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24 on his orders.  
  
This was reported by the propaganda resource TASS, quoting the press secretary of the head of the Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov.  
  
We are talking about Ukraine's refusal to join NATO and its ""neutral status""  
  
""Putin is ready to negotiate with the leadership of Ukraine about its ""neutral status and the refusal to deploy weapons if Kiev is ready to do so,"" Peskov said.

Sanctions have a statistically significant reduction in the economic power of the country, by around 25% over 10 years. So they are, absolutely, effective at doing what they are designed to do.

For your question, sanctions aren't a surprise, international diplomacy is designed to be a transparent and unambiguous process. A country that does something, and was warned about sanctions, had already weighed the pros and cons before doing that thing. So sanctions are never going to stop someone after the fact. 

What it does do is act as a deterrent. If a country sees a marginal benefit to doing something, they may do it. Sanctions tilt the balance toward not doing it by increasing the cost. Or they may equivocate and take measures that stop short of all out war. 

For example it's widely considered that Russia stopped at Crimea in 2014 due to sanctions. [Source](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/the-impact-of-western-sanctions-on-russia/). 

> In a contradictory fashion, Russian officials dismiss Western sanctions as ineffective, while they constantly complain about them and ask for them to be lifted.75 Tellingly, Russia’s GDP has grown by an average of only 0.3 percent a year since the West imposed financial sanctions on Russia in 2014, and it is not likely to grow significantly again until the Kremlin makes sufficient concessions to the West as to ease the sanctions.

It's not perfect, but listen to the oligarchs themselves. Russia's interference in the US was driven directly by the need to reduce magnitsky act sanctions. Russian state media says that sanctions are no big deal.

Russian soldiers, even those that willingly signed up to be part of Russia's army, aren't making the decision to invade Ukraine.  They are following orders to invade and if they don't follow orders face serious consequences.

There is also a not so little thing in Russia called ""Conscription"" that's mandatory for all males from the ages of 18-33 unless you have a certain exemption.  (See not being poor)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Russia

It last for 1 year and currently makes up somewhere between 225-400k active personell in Russia's army.

It looks like a minority of 36% of Russia 's actually support military force in Ukraine and I suspect that number will drop further when casualties begin to mount.

""I was watching videos of the Ukrainian coup government shelling civilians in the breakaway regions yesterday. No mention of it on msnbc, but I get home from work tonight and now they've got a fancy banner, slide transition, and catchy jingle for the ""RUSSIAN INVASION.""  
Not all the regions of Ukraine accepted the coup government, which has been using violence against those regions since the coup. With the u.s. providing billions in funding and arms to the coup government, which has incorporated actual neo-nazi regiments into its military, who could those regions possibly call for help but Russia? The rest of europe is proudly arming the nazis (again). Open a map and really look! Who else is even around that could help?  
I can't help but think of when the Afghan government asked for Soviet military assistance. It's still taught here as a ""Soviet invasion."" I wonder if u.s. media had a catchy jingle for it then too. Pay attention to how often msnbc mentions the u.s.'s support of the 2014 coup in Ukraine and its arming of neo-nazis in the coup government's military.

I don't want to be argumentive; I just would rather you knew the whole story.     
      
It started at the RNC in Cleveland when delegates from the Trump campaign tried to roll back the  call for sanctions and aid to Ukraine in the party platform language.  Remember at the time Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort was in debt to a Russian oligarch to the tune of ten million dollars but I'm sure that's just a coincidence.    
   
Then when Trump won the election the talk all over DC was of how his staff's first order of business was to end the current Russian sanctions via executive order, and that worried many Republicans in Congress.  At that point Congress took it upon themselves to codify those sanctions into law so that they could not be repealed by executive order.  Trump was entirely opposed to this new legislation.  He said the legislation contained ""clearly unconstitutional provisions"" and and left open the possibility that he might choose not to enforce them as lawmakers intended.       
      
The law passed by one of the widest margins in history, with a veto-proof majority, leaving Trump no option but to sign it.  At the signing ceremony he said ""I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars. That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress,"" he said, but added he was ""signing this bill for the sake of national unity.""       
    
Eventually the executive branch did enforce most of the sanctions, but did not start doing so until four weeks past the deadline called for in the law.       

So the whole idea that Trump issued these tough sanctions on Russia is completely false.  Congress issued them, and Trump was forced to go along with them, and  he remained opposed to them.  But that won't stop him from saying ""nobody is tougher on Russia than me"".      

This has all been widely reported on by every major news outlet, and if you need sources I can help point you in the right direction, but I suggest you take the time and study it for yourself.  I honestly hope this was helpful to you.",False,1645797404.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hy9y32c,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

and i believe (again, off the top of my head), that the colonial wars with french started around 1949 after it became clear france didn't want to give up its colony

my main point is that the Vietnam v France (preUSA) is pretty damn similar to Ukraine v separatists(preRussia).. both had around a decade of fighting foreign hostile powers in their borders prior to the 'big' invasion.

to your point, this excludes a long history of attempted subjugation of Vietnam by China, though I think you could still draw parallels to Ukraine's situation post WW2.  Most of western ukraine was part of poland previously; some parts of Ukraine were (at least initially) supportive of the nazi invasion and looked at them as liberators (until their nature/intentions became apparent, anyway).  Oh, and the famines in the 30s.

So the long term (pre France) situation in Vietnam certainly has some differences compared to the long term (Pre independence) situation in Ukraine, there are certainly similarities.

I mean, kind of? We just got sick of it and left (as we should have - I support that decision)

>Also did they take North Vietnam with relative ease? Oh that’s right they didn’t because they couldn’t. 

I agree here. Vietnam was HELL. It was all jungle and guess what they had China and Russia supporting them RIGHT there. Who's helping Ukraine aside from some very important missiles (which future shipments will likely be cut off) by the way Ukraine is flat and Vietnam is Jungle. Big difference. Urban warfare will be the hellish part but they can probably come out on top, especially east of the Dnieper.

>Russia ***wants*** Ukraine. Permanently. They’re not gonna “missile it into the dirt”….and that’s the point dumbass. Russia simply cannot play the long game. Especially if Ukraine resorts to insurgency after occupation. 

They WANT Ukraine yes, but if they face national humiliation in defeat they will missile it to shit just out of pride and declare victory. 

Also, so long as they can secure everything east of the Dnieper it creates a stronger geographic barrier for the Russian heartland, and gives them access to more ports for the black sea, and they get some of that sweet natural gas in eastern Ukraine. 

>By your incredibly stupid logic, Russia could just nuke Ukraine and say “we won”. 

Difference between vaporizing and crippling.

At the same time, the EU’s expansion eastward and the West’s backing of the pro-democracy movement in Ukraine -- beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004 -- were critical elements, too. Since the mid-1990s, Russian leaders have adamantly opposed NATO enlargement, and in recent years, they have made it clear that they would not stand by while their strategically important neighbor turned into a Western bastion. For Putin, the illegal overthrow of Ukraine’s democratically elected and pro-Russian president -- which he rightly labeled a “coup” - - was the final straw.

What we're witnessing is the problem with the nuclear deterrent, that what it actually does is give those with nuclear weapons carte blanche to invade countries without them, because other countries won't risk a nuclear war by helping out unless they are in an alliance like NATO.  That's why NATO exists in the first place, and why NATO countries won't be giving military aid to Ukraine, because Ukraine is not a part of NATO.  Therefore, this is not NATO's fight, and not worth risking nuclear war over.  Had Ukraine not given up its nukes, Putin would never have been so bold as to invade.  But not having nukes and not being in NATO made them vulnerable and Putin took advantage while he still could.  

If NATO intervenes and Putin doesn't respond with nukes, then it would be the end of Russian power because NATO forces would crush his and use the opportunity to de-nuclearize Russia for good.  By actually invading Ukraine, Putin is basically playing a game of nuclear chicken with the rest of the world and banking on the fact that NATO forces won't risk nuclear war to get involved.  If they do, Putin will likely feel like he has no other choice but to use his last trump card.  Whether or not he actually would is anyone's guess, but given how bold he's been acting lately I wouldn't put it past him.

""Keeping the supply tight is just too good for the bottom line. And if it’s President Biden who will take the heat for high prices at the pumps, that’s just the cherry on top of a very, very lucrative cake. In fact, according to figures from Deloitte LLP, oil explorers in the United States are making more money now than at any other point in the more-than decade-long history of the nation’s shale revolution. “And this may just be the beginning,” Bloomberg Markets reported this week. “Free cash flow, the key metric watched by investors, probably will increase by 38% next year, presuming oil prices remain elevated.”

This kind of restraint is a new development for the shale industry, and it is clearly paying off. Historically, the Permian Basin has been unable to resist a “drill, baby, drill” mentality when oil prices are high, ultimately flooding the market and deflating prices. This would then be followed up by a period of production cuts and austerity measures until oil prices recovered, and then companies would buck production caps and the process would start all over again in an amazingly predictable boom and bust cycle. 

But no longer. “After effectively subsidizing consumers through the 2010s with break-neck drilling that depressed global oil prices, the shale industry appears to have struck a winning formula: moderating production, limiting reinvestment in new wells and shaving debt,” Bloomberg writes.""",False,1645735750.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hya4msg,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

hmm lets see, britain and france still have their nukes, and they're allied with the US who also has them. All a part of NATO, which is directly on Russia's borders. I really don't know what you're getting at, unless you seem to imply that only disarmament in non NATO countries is progress which sounds like a load of horseshit.

let the bullies and the bigger powers disarm, and then the rest can follow suit. Same reason I would still support DPRK, or even countries like Iran to have a nuclear program, because disarmament has to start at the top of the global hegemony.

Case in point: the current situation on a local scale. if Ukraine hadn't disarmed, invasion would be deterred. However they did, which leaves the western countries and Russia as the only two players, out of which Russia is clearly weaker in every regard. Doesn't justify them lashing out at the even weaker Ukraine in such a scenario, but the right precedent in terms of disarmament was never set to begin with.",False,1645751162.0,t3_t0eei6,t1_hyb2muk,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

So... Now you decided to look for what I said previously? You've been the one who disagreed with me on the form and decided to tell me that ""the poor soldiers had no choice"", that they were young, inexperienced, etc.

I always believed and said that on one side the big majority has no other choice but to make do with what his imposed onto them.  
I don't think, nor believe neither said that ""all"" Russians want the war.

But I always said also that if you truly disagree with the orders you're given, then you have to make a choice: You follow them or you don't!  
Either way there will be consequences!
