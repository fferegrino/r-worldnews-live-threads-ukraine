ü™ñ On Tuesday, after months of fighting, russia advanced 2-3km in the [village of Novoluhanske](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1552028968739536899) in the Donbas area. This is not expected to [improve russia's position](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1551911517880307714).  As a view from the russian side of things, here is a translated summary of Igor Girkin‚Äôs [assessment](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551995443004989440.html) of the front lines.  His conclusion is the same as my conclusion (updated below a few days ago): ‚Äúthe Russian Armed Forces, in essence, are LOSSING INITIATIVE to the AFU leadership‚Äù.  For the Ukrainian perspective Dmitry, with his new account, posted a translation of [Oleg Zhdanov's](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552041729058131969.html) assessment.  As usual, [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1552085498985840641), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551867985626791938.html) and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552087834743508992.html) cover all the battles.  

üöß Ukraine sent around [15 missiles](https://twitter.com/michaeldweiss/status/1552051818229800960) at the Antonovskiy Bridge on Tuesday.  This is the larger of the bridges that russia could use to move troops and supplies into Kherson.  russia claimed all the missiles were intercepted, but as you [can clearly see](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1552025055122653188.html), if the bridge is still standing, it‚Äôs doubtful it will be usable by heavy equipment.  

üöß I find [this map](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1549474887365951489) of the bridges of Kherson incredibly helpful to see what‚Äôs going on, [this map](https://twitter.com/ChuckPfarrer/status/1551960215511236610) for a strategic overview, and [this article](https://twitter.com/WarintheFuture/status/1549506667800576000) to know how this battle is being waged.  

üöß With the Kherson bridges being shelled, the Ukraine Army claimed [fire control](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551784611826606080.html) of all transport routes into and out of Kherson.

ü•∑ In partisan activity news, the Satelit factory in Mariupol was set on fire 10 days ago and is [still burning](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPR/status/1551749147321049088).  Satelit is a sunflower oil factory and it was set on fire to prevent russia from pillaging the product to fund its war.

üåæ The first [three ships](https://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/1552057711067635712) carrying Ukrainian grain out of Ukrainian controlled ports are expected to leave port in [the coming days](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1551750400801390599).  Turkey will open its grain corridor [coordination center](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1552030207854477314) on Wednesday. It‚Äôs worth noting that Ukraine has been exporting limited amounts of grain through its Danube ports via Romania since it regained control of Snake Island.

üõ© On Tuesday the russians [shot down](https://twitter.com/MrKovalenko/status/1552117337054187520) one of their [own KA-52 attack helicopters](https://twitter.com/UnqualWarlord/status/1552085149432614912) after it attacked one of their own positions.

üî•üá©üá™ Germany is having an epiphany on [nuclear power](https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1552040866549624832).  This may have been a requirement to get the rest of the EU members to agree to a [15% gas usage reduction](https://twitter.com/KiraTaylor15/status/1551886067132932098) although, as usual, there are [some exemptions](https://twitter.com/AlexKokcharov/status/1551943342262460417).

üî• The EU is expected to [double imports](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1552022301410983938) of Ukrainian generated electricity, giving Ukraine a much needed revenue stream and the EU some relief from the coming energy crisis this winter.  Ukraine [switched its electrical interconnects](https://twitter.com/RonaldTooTall/status/1506676538242179079) from russia to Europe near the start of the war.

üî• On Monday russia reduced gas to Europe in the Nord pipeline to 20% of it‚Äôs capacity and in response gas prices in Europe have risen to over [$2,000 per thousand cubic meters](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551874889832964097). russia is expected to [keep gas supplies tight](https://twitter.com/drudgereportapp/status/1552073531038601218) to keep up the economic warfare with Europe. 

üöÄ russia says it‚Äôs going to [abandon](https://twitter.com/SPACEdotcom/status/1551955831779954688) the international space station after 2024.  NASA intends to keep the station operational until 2030.  Likely russia is having trouble maintaining its space program economically and due to sanctions as the US was majorly responsible for propping up russias space program.  Also, russia is having unexpectedly [strained relations](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1551823330310852608) (paywall) with Kazakhstan, a former USSR state (like Ukraine) which is the location of russia‚Äôs space port.  

üïπÔ∏è In Drone news; the US sees [no indications](https://twitter.com/cmsub/status/1549483614613782529) the suspected sale of Iranian drones has been approved or training begun.  Also, in a meeting with Turkish President Erdogan, putin indicated he would like [Baykar to open a drone factory](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1552005210154930181) in russia although the owners of Baykar appeared to indicate no such deal would be made.

Day 154 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday it was pretty quiet the entire day, if you don‚Äôt count the shelling in the morning that is, and there was also some shelling in Kharkiv oblast at 11pm, but nothing aimed the city. They mostly stopped shelling us during the day, now it happens at 3-4am at the earliest.

Today they also fired at least 7 missiles at the city, they started firing them at 4am and continued until around 5:30am. Apparently the first one just blew up in the air, one was intercepted and the at least 5 hit something in Kharkiv, starting some pretty big fires, smoke was almost everywhere in the city. One of the missiles hit a car service, destroying about 10 cars that were parked there, others hit some civilian infrastructure.

Also yesterday Russian deputies made a bill, which would declare Ukraine a terrorist state and all the countries that are helping us would be declared sponsors of terrorism. Ah yes, terrorism is when you oppose Russia. It‚Äôs obviously against the law to fight them when they come to enslave you, and annex your country. The highest offence is when you retake the territory that they are occupying, because how dare you not let them fabricate their fake referendums to annex territory in peace.

It was also very funny when Antonovsky Bridge was hit by 12 missiles, yet Russia said that all of the missiles were intercepted by their AA and that the bridge was completely unharmed. Why would they even lie like that? This is not something they can hide even if they wanted to, it would have been known in a couple of hours anyway, and the videos were released almost immediately. Unless the AA was actually the bridge itself, then it actually did a great job intercepting all the missiles.",False,1658948888.0,t3_w94iaq,t3_w94iaq,,0,136,0,136,0,0,

- Russian private military company Wagner has likely succeeded in making tactical advances in the Donbas around the Vuhlehirska Power Plant and the nearby village of Novoluhanske. Some Ukrainian forces have likely withdrawn from the area.

- Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently undertaking a tour of Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Republic of the Congo. Russia will highly likely seek to exploit the visits to blame the West for the international food crisis and win the support of African states which have otherwise remained neutral about Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

- Since 2014, Russia has made significant efforts to secure influence across Africa, with Wagner frequently deploying as one of its favoured tools of influence in the region. Russia probably primarily engages with Africa because it believes it will enhance the 'Great Power' identity Russia aspires to. Its secondary goals are probably to secure commodity concessions and to persuade African states to vote in line with Russia's interests in international forums.

Long story short: Russia is fucked economically, and the government is going to be unable to mitigate the tail spin that Russia's economy is going into now. In order to divert energy exports, they would need infrastructure and know-how they don't have and won't have for at least a decade under ordinary circumstances, but with the capital flight of thousands of suppliers, manufacturers, investors, and trading partners, entire supply chains have broken down over night. Because Russia is no longer able to increase its fossil fuel infrastructure, it will eventually run out of currently tapped resources, driving up costs while reducing yields. International loans cannot provide stimulus because of the sovereign default, and China and India are unlikely to invest into Russia either, because Russia is much more dependent on exports to them than they are on Russia, while they do not want to get hit with EU/US sanctions.

This is a ticking time bomb that is going to make sure that once this conflict is over (which will be with a Ukrainian victory), Russia is absolutely not going to be in a position to do this again with anyone for decades to come.",1658946566.0,1658946405.0,t3_w94iaq,t3_w94iaq,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

Simon Ostrovsky (well known former VICE journalist tortured by DPR in 2010s) travelled to the city last week to produce this report for @NewsHour and saw first-hand the devastating toll Russia‚Äôs missiles are taking.

While much reporting lately has focused on the havoc American HIMARS missiles are surely causing to Russian forces, Russia‚Äôs own barrage of missile attacks against Ukraine appears to be well targeted and very damaging not just to civilians, but also to its war effort.

Up to 40 soldiers died in a single strike on a series of warehouses, a volunteer rescue worker said. The toll could be as high as 50, according to another source. ***This illustrates Ukraine‚Äôs desperate need for air defense.***

Both Ukraine and Russia do not routinely disclose their losses. In Ukraine however, this policy works at cross purposes with its goal of convincing allies and their publics of the need for more shipments of arms. It may be seen as an issue of morale here.

Not only is Russia getting accurate coordinates for secret bases and supply dumps but they are hitting their marks. Mykolaiv region was hit with 129 missiles in two weeks. It‚Äôs scary.

Soldiers at the front echoed what the Ukrainian government is saying: western supplied missile systems have helped stabilize the frontline & slowed Russia‚Äôs advance. But that‚Äôs not the whole story. The battle is now increasingly being fought with missiles far behind enemy lines.

Conclusions  

Despite some lingering leakiness, Russian imports have largely collapsed, and the country faces stark challenges securing crucial inputs, parts, and technology from hesitant trade partners, leading to widespread supply shortages within its domestic economy.    

Despite Putin‚Äôs delusions of self-sufficiency and import substitution, Russian domestic production has come to a complete standstill with no capacity to replace lost businesses, products and talent; the hollowing out of Russia‚Äôs domestic innovation and production base has led to soaring prices and consumer angst.

That doesn't automatically mean everything he says is bullshit but in this case Russia has a vested interest in making things look as positive as possible for the defense of Kherson. Until proven otherwise saying the main bridge is still up improves Russian soldier morale and telling the Ukrainian's they missed the rail bridge might cause them to not continue firing at the same place even if they had hit it.

My guess given the accuracy of Ukrainian strikes on the bridges in the area so far is that the Antonovskiy Bridge might still be standing, large bridges are hard to take down with artillery or missile strikes, but that they probably did hit the rail bridge and saying they missed it is an effort to try and  make Ukraine doubt the accuracy of its strikes.

In either case since the Ukrainian's have access to even real time US intelligence I'm sure the next US spy satellite that passes over the area today will tell the Ukrainian's exactly what happened, and until we get more information I wouldn't trust what this guy says too much, he has too many reasons to lie.",False,1658904483.0,t3_w94iaq,t1_ihti2sc,,1,28,0,28,0,0,

Also, since he's trying to get it internationally, [FinCEN](https://www.fincen.gov/) would definitely want a piece of the action.

There's a variety of ways this guy can get himself caught, by chance, though (not saying that anyone *shouldn't* report him to whomever - like the aforementioned or, possibly, the Florida AG).  First method that comes to mind is a sizable money transfer (>$10k) and the bank employee handling it notices that it's likely linked to a criminal or non-legal activity.  If that happened, the employee would file a SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) ([fun guidance issued by FinCEN regarding the current situation - pdf file](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/FinCEN%2520Alert%2520Russian%2520Sanctions%2520Evasion%2520FINAL%2520508.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjp9KmpkJr5AhXHpIkEHe22CggQFnoECAcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw11DwjOMT7qMjxEp3cFYRin)).  Heck, they can even file one if the transaction is ‚â§$10k.  .... The difference is that the larger transactions still require reporting - I presume this is to detect patterns that indicate ... stuff.

Regardless, I'm excited for the day that we get to read a news story about him.

Edit... Had to visit the site.  It lists, openly, regarding monetary donations (of USD):

WTF?

Edit: well, the listed account checks out.

Edit:. *CRAP* THIS GUY LOOKS LIKE HE COPIED (what I think is) THE LEGIT SITE (https://donate.thedigital.gov.ua/) and swapped out the crypto wallet info.  At least that's what it looks like to me.

I wonder if he's in on it or just a mindless repeater.  The fake site is hosted in the UA and is, of course, private on WhoIS.

Edit: you know what?  I'm bored.  Once I get the kids to bed I'm gonna grab a beer (I picked up some [Zywic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BBywiec_Brewery)). I'm going to see if there's anyway (and to whom) I can report this to in Ukraine (I'm thinking governmental body, not the hosting company).  My hope is that they'll pull the records from [NIC.UA](https://nic.ua/) and, if it is *dude*, pick up the phone and make a long distance phonecall to the state department.

I'd be willing to bet that the A-10 would meet Ukraine's needs just fine.  Real talk though: I'm pretty sure it takes about twice as long to train an A-10 pilot than an F-16 pilot - mainly because the tactics and missions are extremely risky and complex (and even the training is very dangerous). 

The open question is whether tanks are actually the real threat for Ukraine, or if the real problem is Russian Artillery. In that case, the A-10 is fine, but it's not the primary task it was designed for, and Ukraine might get better bang-for-buck with F-16's.

As far as whether the A-10 should be retired and replaced with F-35's? I'd say we really need to see how F-35's work in this role in the REAL world, prior to even thinking about it. But I'm just an Armchair General, so what do I know?",False,1658947839.0,t3_w94iaq,t1_ihvb5mg,,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,

2. Ukraine wants to gain their territory BACK, not give it up. Guess what peace keeping forces are for? To stop the fighting.

Declaring that they would be supporting the clearance of Crimea, Ru-Donbas and/or occupied areas would be tantamount to a declaration of war on Russia, so why go through the pantomime of dressing it as a peacekeeping operation? 

Alternatively limiting peacekeeping operations to territory that Ukraine controls effectively legitimises Russians occupation, Ukraine would still see itself as legitimately justified in trying to regain its sovereign territory and Russia would be able to present itself as legitimately justified in counterattacking with the EU/NATO/UN force caught in the middle and probably turn to pressuring UA to scale back.

It is not clear to me whether the EU even has the possibility for that, as each country has their own military and the military collaboration on the EU level is essentially for shared defense. As Ukraine is not part of the EU, there is no clear mandate for the EU to intervene.

Most of the collaboration in military matters among EU countries happens through NATO. But NATO cannot intervene as it is a defensive alliance and, again, Ukraine is not a member. NATO will come into action only if one of the NATO members is attacked, which is not the case here. (NATO has done some peace keeping missions, but those have been controversial as some argue that they are outside of their mandate). 

Another possibility is that those EU countries (and possibly others) which are willing to go to war could form an ""Alliance for the Defense of Ukraine"". This is extremely unlikely to happen. It would basically mean declaring war against Russia, which will make your own country a target and which will almost definitely lead to retaliation in the form of missile strikes on your own country. It will also expand the geographic scope of the war, which everyone wants to avoid (so far fighting has been limited to Ukraine and border areas of Russia). Any politican who would decide that, knowing that they will suffer both military and civilan casualties, would risk their career. Furthermore, Ukraine is Russias backyard, so for other countries the logistics to go to war there would be very hard.

A large chunk of the western coverage has been poor, their choice in experts has been crap and their contributors are often bad at assessing who truly is an expert.

Russian sources are generally far worse because there is a strong propaganda and state-driven narrative.

Western outlets tend to have biases but these are more driven by their customers and viewers.


Poor quality is as true of this war as with any other subject these days.

How many times have you heard of a new study contradicting some previously iron-clad scientific known, only for the reporting to disappear?

The trick is reading what facts are described in a news piece and then corroboration by other sources or understanding the context and biases of those outlets you read.

And know who is and isn't an expert. It's hard but filter out the ones who consistently get things wrong and look for those who have been right, I recommend Gen Hertling and Mick Ryan.

Generally in this type of war, actual experts don't make hard and fast assessments or predictions but conditional with likeliness and are frank about their accuracy or unknowns.

E.g. If Ukraine can successfully isolate Russian forces in Kherson from their supply lines, it will likely result in a quicker recapture of the city rather than a protracted siege, but a long siege is still possible. Despite this, OSINT is limited and the fog of war persists, making accurate predictions questionable. (I made this one up as an example).

On the positive side, any of the moves used to reduce EU dependence on Russian gas + oil will also have permanent impacts on decarbonization, and will result in demand destruction for carbon energy sources.

As for food security, we also have to remember that farmers will have lower yields for want of cheap urea. The Arab Spring was kicked off due to high food prices.

The issue, if you use it for heating, isn't that it's impossible to not use gas. Gas really only became popular for industrial furnaces ~20 years ago, and people used e.g. oil or coal before that. The issue is that if everyone is now shopping for oil furnaces, it'll get really expensive because nobody's been producing a spare amount of these highly specialized machines that have more and more been considered outdated. So if you want one and you want it installed before winter, it'll cost and there won't be enough to go around for everyone, so smaller businesses will really feel the pain.

Russia‚Äôs head of their bank Elvira Nabiullina (the one who tried to resign when Russia invaded but Putin denied her attempt) is a well-respected economist amongst world economists, and part of the reason why Russia‚Äôs economy hasn‚Äôt completely collapsed yet is bc of her actual competent work managing their economic crisis.  She‚Äôs really good at what she does. Unfortunately she is working for the wrong people; she could do so much good for the world anywhere else.

But yeah, sure, the Russian economy is fine‚Ä¶

Edit: as to ammo, with all of the ammo dumps going up in flames, the amount of reported missiles, rockets, etc. being fired at Ukraine has decreased significantly.  But yeah, sure, they‚Äôll never run out of ammo and their infinite ammo stores are not impacting their current operations at all..

Edit 2: as to those ‚Äúexperts‚Äù claiming when Russia would collapse, most of them are armchair generals just like us, even if some of them are actual generals who were involved in other wars some time in the past. They‚Äôre watching this war just like us and don‚Äôt really know when this war will end, even if they want to spout off their predictions. Any competent person can‚Äôt answer that question, not even Ukraine. The best answer is to take a dose of hopium and stay positive about what Ukraine is succeeding with and also adjusting to situations where they aren‚Äôt, while acknowledging that this could go on for a while.  For those competent advisors, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone say definitively when the war would end.

Edit 3: as to inflation, most of that started before the war and was caused by other factors. This war contributes to inflation only with respect to goods/commodities that are exported by Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus. If you really want a good explanation about this, watch John Oliver‚Äôs latest episode where he breaks this down. Russia didn‚Äôt start inflation, but certainly helped escalate it.  Fucking COVID is what really set this off.

We also know they are a primarily infantry-based force so this will mean their progress will be slow and incremental.

And we know that they will want some sort of big success prior to Rasputitsa (September sometime).

From that, we know their time window and rough intentions so we watch and wait.
