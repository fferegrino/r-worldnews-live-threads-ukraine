aa5cac11a586001caa4dede8fa919bdb,1432qgq,jn8exc1,"A bit of reality for the experts who say ""not everything is so obvious with the destruction of the dam"" 🐓

To blow up the dam at Kozarovychi in March 2022, 1800 kg of TNT was needed, and cords were added to the UR-77. There were two explosions, the first one with 1000 kg of TNT, and it was not enough.

For the second explosion, the explosives were thrown directly into the crater from the first explosion, with cords to the UR-77.  The second explosion managed to damage the lock, and the water went to Irpin. And this was just the explosion of the lock.

And the dam itself is probably 700 meters long.

The Novokakhovka dam was 16.5 meters high. This is the height of a five-story building. It was almost 4 kilometers long. No missile can destroy this dam. Not even ten missiles.  OTRKs are not designed to destroy such structures. That is why Russians do not hit dams and large bridges. Because OTRKs are designed to destroy headquarters and warehouses, not to punch holes in structures made of tens of meters of concrete.

The Novokakhovka dam was destroyed from below. Apparently, TNT was placed on the columns under water. They mined each column separately, blew it up, and the cumulative effect destroyed the columns underwater, so the destruction started from the bottom. And then the water pressure simply destroyed the dam.

This kind of mining requires several days of work by a group of sappers. And I do not believe it is possible that Ukrainian saboteurs could have brought 4 or more tons of explosives to the hills and placed them on the pillars, in the lock, and in the engine room of the facility, which was carefully guarded by the Russians. 

This is simply impossible.

Arrivals of such an explosive effect that could have caused damage to the dam (not to be confused with the road bridge on the side of the dam, which is just a layer of asphalt on metal structures, and it was hit with a lot of chemicals) would have been filmed by the Russians, and such arrivals cannot be hidden, as well as traces of arrivals from above. And apparently there are none.

The dam was destroyed professionally. The goal was not only to raise the water (the destruction of the lock would have sufficed), but to destroy the dam completely. To create an environmental catastrophe in Ukraine worth billions of dollars and make those territories uninhabitable for a long time.

This is terrorism. And this is the only thing Russia is capable of.

Russian terrorists have once again proved that they are a threat to everything living. The destruction of one of the largest water reservoirs in Ukraine is absolutely deliberate. At least 100 thousand people lived in these areas before the Russian invasion. At least tens of thousands are still there. Hundreds of thousands of people have been left without normal access to drinking water. Our services, all those who can help people, are already involved. But we can only help on the territory controlled by Ukraine. On the part occupied by Russia, the occupiers are not even trying to help people.

This once again demonstrates the cynicism with which Russia treats the people whose land it has captured and what Russia really brings to Europe and the world.

We all need clarity on NATO membership. In fifteen years, the reality has changed dramatically and so should NATO’s approach. The difference between 2008 and now is that Ukraine is now a valuable asset to the Alliance rather than a liability. Ukraine will make NATO stronger.

In our call, we also focused on sustainable artillery ammunition supplies in order to secure the effectiveness of Ukraine's counter-offensive operations. Not only Ukraine’s future, but the future of the Euro-Atlantic community is being decided on Ukraine’s battlefield right now.

To alleviate the crisis caused by Russia's destruction of the Kakhovka dam, @JensStoltenberg promised NATO mechanisms will be used to provide humanitarian assistance. In this regard, he will head an emergency meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Comission called at my request tomorrow.""

>
>1. Avoid the temptation to bothsides a calamity. That's not journalism.
>
>2. When a Russian spokesperson claims that Ukraine did something (e.g. blow a dam), this is not part of a story of an event in the real world.  It is part of a different story: about all the outrageous claims Russia has made about Ukraine since invading in 2014.
>
>3. Citing Russian claims next to Ukrainian claims is unfair to the Ukrainians. What Russian spokespersons have said has almost always been untrue, whereas what Ukrainian spokespersons have said has largely been reliable. The juxtaposition suggests a false equality.
>
>4. If a Russian spokesman (e.g. Dmitri Peskov) must be cited, it must be mentioned that this specific figure has lied about every aspect of this war. This is not insult but context. Readers picking up the story in the middle need to know the background.
>
>5. If Russian propaganda for external consumption is cited, so must that for internal consumption. Propagandists long argued that Ukrainian dams should be blown. A Russian parliamentarian takes for granted Russia blew the dam and rejoices. See @JuliaDavisNews
>
>6.  When a story begins with bothsidesing, readers are instructed that an object in the physical world (like a dam) is just an element of narrative. They are guided into the wrong genre (literature) right at the moment when analysis is needed. This does their minds a disservice.
>
>7. Dams are objects. How they can be destroyed is a subject for experts. This NYT story has the  merit of treating dams as physical rather than narrative objects. It becomes clear that the dam was likely destroyed by an explosion from the inside.
>
>8. Russia was in control of the relevant part of the dam when it exploded. This is an elemental part of the context. It comes before what anyone says. When a murder is investigated, detectives think about means. Russia had the means. Ukraine did not.
>
>9. The story doesn't start at the moment the dam explodes. For the last fifteen months Russia has been killing Ukrainian civilians and destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, whereas Ukraine has been trying to protect its people and the structures that keep them alive.
>
>10. The setting includes military history. Armies that are attacking do not blow dams to block their own path of advance. Armies that are retreating do blow dams to slow the advance of the other side. Ukraine was advancing, and Russia was retreating.
>
>Objectivity does not mean treating an event as a coin flip between two public statements. It demands thinking about the objects and the settings that readers require for understanding amidst uncertainty.

The biggest man-made disaster since Chernobyl is on the conscience of Putin and his henchmen.

The reasons for blowing up the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station are obvious: Russia is trying to slow down the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and buy time to escape from the Crimea. In other words, in order to solve the operational task, Putin went on an act of environmental terrorism, which could have critical consequences not only for the Kherson region, but for all of humanity.

We must win this war! As long as the terrorist Putin is alive, this war has no peaceful and diplomatic solution. Putin will not go away on his own, and while he is in power, there is only one way we can end this nightmare: by inflicting a final military defeat on him and by executing a death sentence.

*The appeal was recorded on 06.06, the day the hydroelectric power station was blown up.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-07-23/index.html

""Petro Poroshenko, Ukraine's former president told CNN Wednesday that the Nova Kakhovka dam collapse in the Kherson region is a ""catastrophe"" for Ukraine. He said, ""We are hit in the heart, and this is the biggest man-made catastrophe in the 21st century.""

Speaking from Kyiv, Poroshenko told CNN's Kate Bolduan that artillery trucks will be heading to the south to the brigade that is now in the ""process for finishing preparation for the counteroffensive operation.""

He said it's possible the dam disaster was created by Russia to stop a counteroffensive, but Ukrainian troops would not be stopped from carrying it out. He added that it's creating a disaster for the civilians but not for the troops. ""Nothing can stop Ukrainian troops,"" he said.

Looking at his watch, Poroshenko said the counteroffensive ""will start within hours,"" adding ""within hours, not days, but hours."" CNN cannot independently verify this.

What Ukraine's allies are saying: US and Western officials see signs that Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia is beginning and have noted a “substantial increase in fighting” in the east of the country over the last 48 hours as Ukrainian troops probe for weaknesses in Russian defensive lines, a senior NATO official said on Tuesday.

Some more context: A major dam and hydroelectric power plant in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine was destroyed early Tuesday, prompting mass evacuations and fears for large-scale devastation as Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other. Ukraine accused Moscow’s forces of committing an act of “ecocide.” The Kremlin denied involvement and accused Ukraine of ""deliberate sabotage"" of the dam.

I'm posting it for people that just like to read stories. I have no proof if anything of the following is true. 

TL;DR - Russians are even more stupid that you think.


>New version on Kakhovskaya HPP: mistake of sappers and unplanned explosion

>In the afternoon of June 6 we received a report from a source who introduced himself as a member of the Russian Armed Forces. According to him, the explosion of the dam was planned for the end of this week. On the evening of June 5, sappers of the 31st Engineer-Sapper Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Sivykh and Senior Lieutenant Goncharov, were working at the hydroelectric plant.

>""In short, everything went through the crapper. They should blow it up closer to the end of the week. Someone, namely two morons, Lieutenant Sivyh and Senior Lieutenant Goncharov, from the recently deployed bomb squad, should have just checked whether everything was ready. Everyone can see what they did there,"" the report said.

>The 31st Engineer-Sapper Regiment (regiment number 31777, Prokhladny, Kabardino-Balkaria), according to staff officers, was indeed in the area of Novaya Kakhovka. The unit specializes in crossing and mine work.

>It is also known that the HPP dam was mined back in October 2022, when the Russian Armed Forces were either preparing to defend Kherson or retreat from it.

>A Russian officer who was in the flooded area on June 6 also confirmed that he heard from other officers about the work of a bomb squad at the hydroelectric plant during the night of June 5-6 and about the explosion in the engine room and subsequent detonation of charges planted last fall at the base of the dam. According to him, as well as the source who gave us the names of the lieutenants, the entire bomb squad was killed in the explosion.

>We have not yet been able to verify the identities of Lieutenant Sivykh and Senior Lieutenant Goncharov. If there are people from Prokhladny or 31st engineer-sapper regiment among our readers, please write to us at volyamedia@protonmail.com. Anonymity is guaranteed.

>The unplanned detonation explains why both the AFU and the RF Armed Forces and local authorities on both sides were unprepared for what had happened. It also becomes clear why the commander of the Russian Dnepr group, Oleg Makarevich, moved headquarters and the entire command structure closer to the river on June 5. If the bombing of the dam was planned for June 9-11, the grouping in Kherson Oblast should have prepared for retreat during those days, mined the current positions, and prepared for the loading of equipment. The transfer of control close to the front lines would (in the logic of the Russian army) speed up this process and ensure greater control over the quality of execution. Then came the explosion, which no one had expected, and the Russian army lost much of its equipment and personnel documents.

>The version with the sapper's error seems quite plausible, many events in the war happen not according to a ""cunning plan"" and even outside the framework of logic and common sense (which civilian specialists always try to find when working with open data), but by chance or a combination of circumstances. The explosion on the night from June 5 to 6 (at this very moment) was not needed by either the Ukrainian or the Russian military. The former did not have time to prepare for an offensive across the river, the latter for a retreat, and they also managed to drown up to a third of the Kherson group's equipment.

387d9fe3b2d0ec89aae6fea555bd1baa,1432qgq,jnbpi5n,"> Lots of people, myself included, have been censored by Twitter for writing about Ukraine. I've spent quite some time in imperial archives exploring how writings about Ukraine were censored in Tsarist Russia, so here're my short historical censorship guide for those concerned:

>Search for the word ""Ukraine"" in the first place. Normally, tsarist censorship changed it to ""Little Russia,"" ""South Region,"" or ""South-West Region"" (for Kyiv, Volhynia, and Podolia provinces). Besides, any publication can be considered ""tendentious"" if it is...
""imbued with love for the Cossacks and Ukraine."" This was the fault of the poem ""The Cossacks and the Sea"" by Danylo Mordovtsev (RGIA, f. 776, op. 21, ch. 1, d. 164, l. 128).

>Mercilessly ban everything that ""reminds the readers about the rights"" that Ukraine once possessed before Russia abolished its self-rule. The children's tale ""The Legend about the Zaporozhian Cossacks"" was banned for this very reason (f. 776, op. 11, d. 65. l. 1).

>Even more ruthlessly ban anything calling for Ukraine's self-government. The ""revolutionary Ukrainian anthem"" ""Ukraine has not yet perished"" was banned because it called to ""restore the independence of Ukraine"" (f. 776, op. 16, ch. 2, d. 817. l. 2 ob.)

>Of course, Putin claims that ""Ukraine did not exist in the history of humanity"" until the Bolsheviks invented it, but tsarist censors didn't know such thing. Their main concern was that Ukraine might ""restore"" its statehood.

>Folklore can also be banned. A historical song mourns the fate of Ukraine under the Russian rule? Ban. A song reminds about the abolition of the Zaporozhian Sich? Ban. A song blames Catherine II for Ukraine's misfortunes? You know the drill (f. 776, op. 11, d. 61 а, l. 78).

>Pictures? Why not ban them! A kobzar grieves over the broken bandura? This is a surefire sedition. Ban (f. 776, op. 21, ch. 1, d. 626, l. 46).

>Last but not least: anti-Russian sentiment. This must be prosecuted throughout. ""Moscow broke the Cossackdom,"" they say? How can such ""hatred for Russia"" ever be allowed? (f. 776, op. 21, ch. 1, d. 626, l. 63)

>What shouldn't be censored? As Pushkin famously put it, Ukrainians are ""the singing and dancing tribe,"" so humorous songs with vodka and clumsy Ukrainian characters indulging in never-ending joy are most welcome. In the empire of general merriment, there's no place for sorrow.

I know its a dead horse at this point, we all know Russia was responsible, but the video helps to lay out info that basically confirms it. Like the changing narrative from the mayor in Nova Kakhova and the lack of logic from the Russian claims (That Ukraine blew it up with tons of explosives they magically moved onto the bridge but nobody heard until hours later)

He makes a good point that I am a convinced of now. It is likely that the Russian military aimed to flood the river to make a crossing more difficult or impossible over the course of a few days, and likely made a small hole inside the dam with the purpose of pouring out water and widening the river. But the flooding caused the damage to widen, and eventually open entirely breaking apart the river.

This can explain why Russian troops would not have been warned, as the assumption from the Russian side is  that they would have some hours or even days to warn them as the flooding would not be instant.

 It also makes sense with the fact that Russia didn't have one of its telltale media spins already prepared like normal, its likely they didn't fully intend for this to happen. Had they planned on this, the ""NATO/UKRAINE/SATANIST SPELLS"" blame game would've started immediately and an article on RT and TASS would've been written by chat GPT in less than 15 minutes. 

It also syncs up well with the abnormally high quantity of water in the Reservoir. Russia likely built up the water for weeks in preparation of when the counteroffensive began and the goal was to flood the river to buy them some time. 

tl;dr: Russia likely wanted to flood the river to stall possible Ukrainian counteroffensive actions over  the river, in doing so they failed, broke the dam entirely and flooded it way to fast.",False,1686117252.0,t3_1432qgq,t3_1432qgq,,0,60,0,60,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-07-23/index.html

""Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proposed in separate phone calls Wednesday to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin to establish an international commission to investigate the dam damage in the Kherson region. 

President Erdogan stated in both calls that an international commission could be established with the participation of experts from the warring parties, the United Nations, and the international community, including Turkey, for a detailed investigation into the ""explosion"" at the Nova Kakhovka dam, according to a statement made by the Turkish presidency's Directorate of Communications. 

During the separate calls with both leaders, President Erdogan stated that it is important to carry out a comprehensive investigation ""that leaves no room for suspicion.""

On the call with Erdogan, Putin accused Ukraine of committing terrorist acts.

“A clear example of this is the barbaric action to destroy the [Kakhovka] hydroelectric power station in the Kherson region, which led to a large-scale environmental and humanitarian catastrophe,” according to a Kremlin readout of the call.

Kyiv and Moscow have blamed each other for the dam breach, which occurred in territory occupied by Russia. The cause remains unclear, and CNN analysis of satellite images shows the dam was damaged just days before it collapsed.

Some more context: A major dam and hydroelectric power plant in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine was destroyed early Tuesday, prompting mass evacuations and fears for large-scale devastation as Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other. Ukraine accused Moscow’s forces of committing an act of “ecocide.” The Kremlin denied involvement and accused Ukraine of ""deliberate sabotage"" of the dam.

The dam is a critical piece of infrastructure: It supplies water for much of southeastern Ukraine, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, and the Crimean peninsula.""",False,1686149470.0,t3_1432qgq,t3_1432qgq,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

**Nato members may send troops to Ukraine, warns former alliance chief**

*Security guarantees and membership path needed at Nato summit to avoid escalation, says Anders Rasmussen*

A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states including the US do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said.

Rasmussen, who has been acting as official adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Ukraine’s place in a future European security architecture, has been touring Europe and Washington to gauge the shifting mood before the critical summit starts on 11 July.

He also warned that even if a group of states did provide Ukraine with security guarantees, others would not allow the issue of Ukraine’s future Nato membership to be kept off the agenda at Vilnius.

He made his remarks as the current Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, said the issue of security guarantees would be on the agenda at Vilnius, but added that Nato – under article 5 of the Washington treaty – only provided full-fledged security guarantees to full members.

The US ambassador to Nato, Julianne Smith, said: “We are looking at an array of options to signal that Ukraine is advancing in its relationship with Nato.”

Rasmussen said: “If Nato cannot agree on a clear path forward for Ukraine, there is a clear possibility that some countries individually might take action. We know that Poland is very engaged in providing concrete assistance to Ukraine. And I wouldn’t exclude the possibility that Poland would engage even stronger in this context on a national basis and be followed by the Baltic states, maybe including the possibility of troops on the ground.

“I think the Poles would seriously consider going in and assemble a coalition of the willing if Ukraine doesn’t get anything in Vilnius. We shouldn’t underestimate the Polish feelings, the Poles feel that for too long western Europe did not listen to their warnings against the true Russian mentality.”

He said it would be entirely legal for Ukraine to seek such military assistance.

His striking suggestion that some states may regard the stakes as momentous enough to use their own troops could be seen as a warning to countries that the risks, including the threat to Nato unity, do not only come if Ukraine is provided a quick path to Nato membership, or powerful security guarantees. Germany remains wary of going too far, fearing it would provoke Russia.

Rasmussen said it was imperative that Ukraine should receive written security guarantees, preferably before the summit, but outside the Nato framework. These need to cover intelligence sharing, joint Ukraine training, enhanced ammunition production, Nato interoperability and a supply of arms sufficient to deter Russia from a further attack.

He said that “after a slow start, momentum was now building behind these ideas”, including in France.

But he warned that security guarantees would not be enough.

He said that “some Nato allies might be in favour of the security guarantees to actually avoid a real discussion on Ukraine’s membership aspirations. They hope that by providing security guarantees, they can avoid this question. I don’t think that is possible. I think the Nato issue will be raised at the summit in Vilnius. I’ve spoken with several eastern European leaders, and there is a group of hardcore, eastern central European allies that want at least a clear path for Ukraine towards Nato membership.”

He said history showed it was dangerous to leave Ukraine in the Nato waiting room indefinitely. Even if an invitation to Ukraine to join Nato could not be provided at the Vilnius summit, the possibility of extending an invitation in Washington next year could be referenced. That path to membership, he said, should exclude setting preconditions such as a Nato membership action plan, something neither Sweden nor Finland have been required to adopt as part of their membership path.

“Anything less than that would be a disappointment to Ukraine,” he said.

He rejected the argument that Ukraine could not be offered a path to Nato membership until the war was over, saying this would provide Putin with a veto.

Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Army learned this the hard way during the First Gulf War. The U.S. Army, famously having fewer horses and bayonets than they once had, opted out of fighting the war the way Saddam might have hoped.
In 1990, the Iraqi dictator invaded neighboring Kuwait for a couple of reasons, none of them good. He claimed that the tiny, oil-rich country was a historical province of Iraq. He also believed the Kuwaitis were stealing Iraqi oil through slant drilling and driving the price down to hurt Iraq's economy. He also thought the United States would be cool with it.
He was wrong.
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and toppled the unprepared country within 12 hours. President George H.W. Bush ordered Operation Desert Shield in response to the invasion. The U.S. military began building up its forces in the area in case Iraq wouldn't leave Kuwait. By November 1990, the United Nations Security Council gave Iraq a deadline of Jan. 15, 1991, to get out.
But Saddam wasn't going to just sit there and wait to get his butt kicked. He moved an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 troops into Kuwait to greet the Americans and their coalition partners. The Jan. 15 deadline passed, and the ""Mother of All Battles"" was on.
On Jan. 17, 1991, Operation Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm. The U.S.-led coalition waged a Noah's Ark-like air campaign for 40 days and 40 nights before the ground war even began. On Feb. 23, coalition forces made their way toward Kuwait. That's when they found the Iraqis had literally dug in.
The ""Saddam Line"" was Iraq's first line of defense, a series of trenches (some filled with oil to be ignited), sand berms, trench works, anti-tank ditches, barbed wire and mine fields. It was all that was keeping the coalition allies out of Kuwait. The attack to liberate Kuwait began at 4 a.m. local time, and the Saddam Line of trenches was the first stop along the way.
By 6:45 a.m., the allies had broken the Saddam Line and were deep inside Kuwaiti territory.
The secret to their success was nothing they had to work with in World War I. There were no bayonets, no trench brooms and no chemical warfare (at least, not from the Americans). The U.S. 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) instead used minesweeping plows mounted on tanks along with ""combat earthmovers"" in what soon became known as the ""bulldozer assault.""
Rather than clear the trenches man by man, the Americans simply plowed through the Iraqis on combat earthmovers, even burying some defenders alive as they tried in vain to shoot the bulldozers.
""For all I know, we could have killed thousands,"" Col. Anthony Moreno, commander of the brigade that led the assault, told The Seattle Times. ""I came through right after the lead company. What you saw was a bunch of buried trenches with people's arms and things sticking out of them.""
The Americans suffered zero casualties in the assault, as they were all inside of armored vehicles and the Iraqi ground forces had no answer to them. As the Iraqis watched their comrades buried alive, they began to surrender en masse.
Some 70 miles of trenches were plowed over in a matter of hours. About 2,000 of the 8,000 defenders surrendered. It's not known just how many Iraqi soldiers were literally buried in the onslaught.
""I know burying people like that sounds pretty nasty,"" Col. Lon Maggart told Seattle Times reporter Patrick J. Sloyan, ""but it would be even nastier if we had to put our troops in the trenches and clean them out with bayonets.""

They don't need to let it melt down. They just need to blow it up and let nuclear material flow in to the Dnipro river to cause massive ecological destruction. The Dnipro flows into the Black Sea and then the Black Sea into the Mediterranean Ocean. That would cause huge environmental problems for the coastal Russian regions in the Black Sea area but the Russians don't care about their own people. They are run by a Mafia state who wants to stay in power.

Obviously it seems ludicrous to suggest such a thing would happen, it was ludicrous to think they would use a reservoir dam as a weapon of mass destruction. It can't be understated just how bad the situation is by breaching this dam. It also suggests that they don't care about the 1.97 million population of Crimea. Irrigation is now lost in the Kherson region and will be lost to Crimea. This is utter devastation and destruction by a terrorist state. Russia is a terrorist pariah state and once Western allies have completed their investigation and found Russia to be at fault, they must demonstrate that we do not tolerate terrorism and we do not negotiate with terrorists. Maybe it was also done with the intent to make Western allies and populations think Russia is absolutely crazy and they might blow up the ZNPP reactor. Apparently they have mined the facility so it is possible they could blow it up. Can't imagine it happening because the events after that are unimaginably bad.

A few weeks ago, the level of the dam was 3.5m lower - if Ukraine had been able to blow it then, the death and damage to Ukraine and Ukrainians would have been far lower.  Since that time the sluice gates were closed by russian operators, sending the reservoir to levels considered dangerously high.  Now is the ideal time for a terror attack, and the worst time for a mitigation detonation. 

In addition, this week (likely though there is no direct information on this) is when Ukraine is running a major counter-offensive against russia.  They had troops placed on the islands in the river, with the threat of an offensive across it if an opening allowed, while other attacks occur at multiple points north of the reservoir.  By detonating the river, the entire ~300km area becomes impassible for months at least, allowing/forcing russian forces defending it to be redeployed to the now-shorter front.

Thirdly, russia has direct access to the dam.  The bridge access was blown on the Ukrainian side as they withdrew across the river (see the rightmost/NW end of the dam [here](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/07/kakhovka-dam-flooding-ukraine-before-and-after-satellite-images-reservoir-kherson-oblast)).  To place charges within the concrete would be easy from the russian side, but from the Ukrainian side would need some serious (but not impossible) navy-seal type maneuver.

Yes. Pro-Nazi sentiment and isolationism were huge in the USA until Pearl Harbor changed that.

Remember that France was taken over in 1940, but the USA wouldn't intervene in the war until December 1941... over 18 months later. And it was August 1939 when Poland was taken over (crossing Britain / France's red line and forcing their entry into WW2), but USA didn't care much. Furthermore, the USA only declared war on Japan. It was Hitler who declared war on USA.

There was a huge chance USA never would have fought the Nazis if Hitler were smarter about the situation. We were kind of only mad at the Japanese.

---------------

EDIT: The only reason why FDR was able to get aid packages to Britain was by convincing the American people that ""If Britain holds themselves, we won't have to go to war"".

--------------

USA likes to forget its own history and cowardice behind WW2. But we were extremely isolationist at the time. And major celebrities, such as Charles Lindbergh (Spirit of St. Louis, first Transatlantic Flight) was literally dining with the Nazis during Kristallnacht.

-----------

All the anti-Nazi stuff came out after 1942, when US Government paid Disney to make anti-Nazi cartoons to drum us up ready for War.

Algorithms just optimized on a particular metric, exactly like you said: ""engagement"". Problem was the algorithms are unrefined and childish.

So the algorithms kept optimized until they found the global optimal solution for bigger numbers, or what we would call, ""rock bottom"". They were just a number, they didn't care how they got them.

The next problem is that these companies have no incentive to change. Advertising is a clusterfuck of conjecture, bullshit, and psuedo-science. But one they ""know"" is that bigger numbers = better. So platform is incentivized to do anything less than just pump those numbers as high as they can go. 

Do they make better customers? Is it a good long-term strategy? Are we building a society anyone will actually want to live in? Fuck it, who cares! /s

Russia not only denied any involvement, they actively hung Wagner out to dry. 

The US couldn't bring in aircraft at first because Wagner had an AA unit. After Washington contacted their Russian counterparts, **Russia shut off the AA system**, leaving the airspace clear for American aircraft to operate. Wagner had also called in a Russian bomber - which turned around midflight and returned to base, instead of joining the attack.

That's one opinion. Take the opposite premise, that's it not absolutely pointless and there are possibly good reasons for doing so, as weighed and measured by teams of professional foreign policy and military experts. What might those reasons be?  Perhaps its not so trivial.

> The only one here determining if the west is involved enough to justify declaring war on the West is Russia.

That is incredibly simplistic and definitive. From that perspective, Russia hasn't even declared war on Ukraine, technically this was and still is positioned as a Special Military Operation by RU. The West is not a country or organization to declare war on, so which nations exactly, and when? Are you suggesting they'll declare war on dozens and dozens of countries at once?

> Nobody knows where the Red lines are. If there are any.

Maybe no public civilians do at this point, but that doesn't mean that ""nobody knows"". High level closed door diplomatic talks and various other communications are employed all the time. Just because we all don't know right this moment doesn't mean nobody knows.

> This is just for the history books.

Well, global public opinion both now and in the far unseen future are aspects that can be managed. That's one simple motive you have ascribed, and it could be a factor, but most likely its just one of many factors involved and could be a secondary or tertiary consideration depending on the circumstances.

You can't have f16s reliably if there's a ton of AA on the field. So you have to send things to open the flight corridors up and clear out enemy AA. At the same time those systems like artillery and missiles need to be protected from enemy AA. So we need to send AA. At the same time there's an enormous front with constant fighting, soldiers firing their weapons hundreds if not thousands of times per day. So you need small arms, ammunition, food, medical supplies, etc.

When your single largest benefactor is thousands of miles away you need to ship those things via plane, train, ship and automobiles and that's a task.

I think without Western countries being actively involved in the war, this might be about the speed it can go.

It's often forgotten just how large an effect the United States had on the industrial evolution of the USSR in the 20's and 30's, long before hostilities began.

The gigantic industrial firms of the United States [were the primary providers of tools, equipment and most critically, knowledge](https://www.americanheritage.com/how-america-helped-build-soviet-machine), that the USSR leveraged to build out its manufacturing, resource extraction and industrial sectors.

This includes the many famous ""tractor factories"" that helped the Soviets churn out the tanks that changed the tide of the war. This even extends to much of the original equipment installed in the dam that Russia just destroyed:

>The falls of the Dnieper River, once dominated by a fortress of Ukrainian Cossacks, was chosen as the site of the most ambitious of the new construction schemes, a mammoth hydroelectric plant and regional complex.  ... the Dnieper effort was done in American style. The Soviets named the American Hugh Cooper as chief consulting engineer ... American companies supplied equipment and engineers. International General Electric built five of the nine giant generators needed; the rest were built in Leningrad under American supervision. The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company constructed the nine 85,000-horsepower turbines, the world’s largest. German and Swedish firms assumed responsibility for other major items, **but about 70 percent of the hydroelectric equipment was American.** Steam shovels, hoists, locomotives, rock drills, and construction steel also came from the United States. One American who saw the site said it looked like a “Little America” —the only unfamiliar part being the presence of women workers. When the American photographer Margaret Bourke-White visited the construction, she observed four soft-spoken Virginians in charge of the Soviets installing the turbines.

The west did not just help the USSR fight the Nazis during WWII, the west also built the factories and infrastructure in the decades before the war that would allow the USSR to even have a credible domestic warfighting capability in the first place -- albiet one that required still required massive reinforcement from international sources to keep the eastern front from utterly collapsing.",False,1686176004.0,t3_1432qgq,t1_jnb239p,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Three years ago Sweden expelled a Kurdish asylum seeker and within a week of arriving in Turkey he was tortured with electric shocks and freezing water. There is photographic evidence. The man is currently serving a 15 year prison sentence for ""terrorism"". His alleged terrorist activities amounted to being active in the PKK youth organisation when he was 17 years old i.e. a *child*. In the past year several expulsions of Kurds to Turkey have taken place and these have been heavily debated and criticised. Our country is still reeling from the disastrous extradition of Agiza and Alzary to Egypt (after pressure from the USA). They were brutally tortured and remain imprisoned without possibility of parole. That whole affair was not known to the public until some journalists revealed it years later.

I'll add that the court made no assessment of ethical concerns with extraditing this guy or what might happen to him (I take it that's what you are trying to insinuate with ""decades of experience and dedication""), they simply concluded that extraditing him is technically not against the European Convention since there is no formal allegation against him. 

So forgive me for thinking that this has nothing at all to do with the human rights situation in Turkey miraculously improving in the past year, and everything to do with political pressure related to Sweden's NATO bid. One has to be pretty damn cynical to pretend otherwise.

You do not have a causal connection that shows a deficiency of Swedish rule of law between the cases. You are making it up based on your preconceived notions.

In your previous comments you showed the exact same lack of coherence. You automatically assume the court is being political, based on your preconceived view and not based on any actual thing that you can point to. You frame everything from an overarching narrative, and then interpret every single event in that light. 

Simply put, there is no ""there"" there, just a lot of magic handwaving and you rolling your eyes saying ""obviously"" like some misunderstood teenage girl. The claims you are making are extraordinary, but rather than offering extraordinary evidence you offer none, only insinuations. 

That doesn't mean Turkey isn't an autocracy and they don't persecute political opponents, it just means that you haven't a shred of evidence that the court here was unduly influenced by politics.

> I'll add that the court made no assessment of ethical concerns with extraditing this guy or what might happen to him 

I don't speak Swedish so I obviously can't engage into this matter deeply. What I do know however that here in the Netherlands when asylum seekers can show that sending them back to their country would result in their false imprisonment, harassment, torture or otherwise would violate their human rights, that is a grounds to let them say. It would be highly surprising to me that such a rule would not exist in Sweden, and if it's not taken up by the Supreme Court, it would rather be taken up by a lower court who has already decided against this person in that matter. 

Fact is, rule of law is not perfect and the situation here is not clear either for me or for you. We could be dealing with a drug dealer falsely claiming to be persecuted, or with an activist falsely accused by Turkey. We do not have the facts of the case, that's what the courts are for. And yet, your first instinct is to dismiss their position based on nothing more than your feelings and a general read of the situation. You offer no evidence, no cause and effect. 

It's absolutely ironic, that in your zeal to defend democracy and rule of law, the first institution you attack is the very one that is tasked with defending it, without even a shred of evidence.

Because that's the only way your reasoning makes sense to me.  And it was WAY more risky to pull that move then since the West was hardly involved at all.  Now the West is involved in almost every manner possible short of sending actual NATO troops in.  And no matter what, THAT prospect will always be facing a potential nuclear escalation and Russia knows this.  They will see to it, even.  So if the jump from ""*Little-to-no Western involvement*"" to ""*The West being all up in their ass*"" wasn't enough to deter the Russians in 2014, how is the current situation going to deter them when they've already made it clear they're willing to go scorched earth?  And remember, for months now, the Kremlin has been pumping out propaganda stating they're actually at war with all of NATO anyway.  Not just Ukraine.

So what is your point - the courts were not biased then but are biased now? Or could it be that they are just independent and made a determination based on the facts of the case, and found that in the cases they blocked - there was political persecution, but in this case there wasn't? Gee, I wonder to what conclusion you will jump.

Magic handwaving. You continue to gesture broadly at the situation as if that would explain everything. There are zero causal connections, no evidence on your behalf - and yet you are ready to claim the courts corrupt.
