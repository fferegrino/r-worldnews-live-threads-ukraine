That argument does not gel *in the slightest* with Putin's own speech where he had a list of bullet-point grievances against Ukraine hundreds of points long, where many of the grievances did not occur this decade or even *this century or the previous century.* The ""tensions"" of the past week or two, supposedly the actual impetus for invading, were barely touched upon in the speech, they were an afterthought. 

A lot of people are going to say Putin gave this speech not for Western audiences but for the Russian people - but I think he gave this speech mostly for an audience of one - himself. This was his moment to bitch and whine, in-front of the entire world, about every self-perceived wrong he and Russia (and it's pretty clear he conflates himself with Russia itself at this point) has ever suffered.

“The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and determination in solidarity with Ukraine”.
  

  
Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, said: “Estonia will never accept the illegal decision by Russia to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
  
“They are an internationally recognised part of Ukraine, like Crimea.
  
“Clearly, Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli.”
  

  
Latvian prime minister Arturs Krisjanis Karins said: “The decision taken by the President of the Russian Federation to recognise the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk, the Ukrainian territories outside the government’s control, is a continuation of the attack on Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity that began in 2014 by unlawfully changing borders in Europe.
  

  
In a gross violation of international law, under a fabricated pretext, and by spreading false information, Russia seeks to induce a change in Ukraine’s political leadership and foreign policy course by violent means.”
  

  
While utterly condemning Russia’s actions, Latvia urges the international community to take the strongest possible measures to stop Russia’s aggression and offer assistance to Ukraine.
  

  
“We call on the international community to action through putting in place robust economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and persons responsible for encroachment on Ukraine’s statehood.”

UN has assembled for a top priority meeting.

The American ambassador at the UN said that it is ""nonsense"" that Russia is sending ""peace troops"" to the east of the Ukraine. According to Linda Thomas-Greenfeld: ""we all know why they are there"", as she said during this emergency UN meeting.

The US thinks that Russia's move to acknowledge the republics in the east of the Ukraine is a pretext to try and make this war legitimate. Thomas-Greenfeld confirmed that this will have consequences. Consequences that will be felt in the Ukraine, Europe and the rest of the world. She does fear however, that this will lead to many casualties if Moscow decides to invade further into Ukraine.

She also said Putin is trying to pull back the world to a time of empires and emperors. And added: this is not 1919. This is 2022.

De VS denkt dat de Ruslands erkenning van de volksrepublieken in Oost-Oekraïne ""een duidelijk voorwendsel voor oorlog is"". Thomas-Greenfeld zegt dat de consequenties van de Russische acties in Oekraïne, Europa en de wereld gevoeld zullen worden. Ze vreest voor veel slachtoffers als Moskou verder Oekraïne in trekt.

There was also alarm at Putin’s warnings of further action against Ukraine as a whole, questioning the country’s legitimacy and presenting a direct threat to Russia.
  

  
Boris Johnson said Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the Donetsk and Luhanks republics was “plainly in breach of international law. It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine”. The UK prime minister also described it as an “ill omen” and a “dark sign” that things are moving in the wrong direction.
  

  
Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron expressed German and French ‘disappointment’ after having been informed of the decision by Putin before his speech, according to a Kremlin account of the call.
  

  
As Putin staged his security council meeting, and ahead of the Russian leader’s televised address, Joe Biden summoned his top national security officials at the White House, including CIA director William Burns and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley.
  

  
It was not immediately clear whether Putin’s declaration would mean the cancellation of a potential summit between Biden and Putin. The Kremlin had earlier played down the prospect of the summit as ‘premature’, while the US made clear it would not take place if Russia invaded.

Russian civilisation begun as an offshoot from the Kievan Rus', a sort of loose confederation of East Slavic peoples centred on Kyiv. Think of it like England and the United States: a small nation accidentally spawning a larger and more powerful one. The difference is, whereas the UK has a long tradition of independent statehood, Ukraine was consumed by the Russian Empire almost immediately.

So Putin is wrong to say Ukraine was never a real nation; if anything *Russia* is the child of Ukraine. But what scares Putin isn't the threat of Ukraine joining NATO; after all, NATO forces can be stationed quite close to Moscow already, in Estonia. And Putin knows that NATO would not attack Russia out of the blue. My theory is what *actually* scares Putin is the idea of a Eastern Slavic state being a functional democracy integrated in to Western European institutions. Because, obviously, if Ukraine joined the EU (functioning democracy is a prerequisite for this) it would develop and quickly outstrip Russia in terms of living standards and GDP per capita. Ordinary Russians would look at their Ukrainian brethren and think ""why can't we have that here?"". The answer would be, of course, the oligarchy and Putin.

What gets me is why he cares so much that he starts proxy conflicts in places like Georgia and Moldova.

Why did Russia surround Ukraine with its military? I believe it’s to spread out the force of the Ukrainian military. Instead of concentrating on defending East Ukraine with most of its army, the threat of invasion from multiple fronts forces Ukraine to disperse defensive positions along their borders. 

I believe that the people of Donbas will “vote” to join Russia, as they did with Crimea, and the Russian army will move in to enforce this annexation.

\- China can't be happy about this.  Their nuclear armed neighbor just seized by force territory from another neighbor.  Nobody wants an unruly neighbor right next door to where they live.

And all the other countries are rallying around the US.  I doubt this is the last thing Russia would want -- to unite all their worst enemies in a common cause to stop their aggression.  Furthermore, the US is stealing China's spotlight on the world stage -- something that China craves (e.g. hosting Olympics in Beijing).   Another reason this has got to piss off China. 

\- Russia is proving the US has been saying to be correct.  From the false flag pretext for the invasion to the invasion itself.

If NATO and the US don't actively step in militarily and make sure Putin is stopped then we are all pretty fucked because it sends the message that Putin can do whatever he wants.

And the living nations wait,  
Each sequestered in its hate;

Stares from every human face,  
And the seas of pity lie  
Locked and frozen in each eye.

To the bottom of the night,

Still persuade us to rejoice;

Make a vineyard of the curse,  
Sing of human unsuccess  
In a rapture of distress;  

In the deserts of the heart  
Let the healing fountain start,  
In the prison of his days  
Teach the free man how to praise.

Moscow. February 21st. INTERFAX.RU - Russian President Vladimir Putin, immediately after addressing the Russians at a ceremony in the Kremlin live, signed a decree recognizing the independence of the Luhansk People's Republic and the Donetsk People's Republic. 
 
The ceremony is broadcast from the Kremlin by the Rossiya-24 TV channel (VGTRK). The ceremony is attended by the heads of the LPR and DPR. 
 
""I consider it necessary to make a long overdue decision - to immediately recognize the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic,"" Putin said during his televised address. 
 
""I ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision, and then ratify the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed in the very near future,"" he added. 
 
Putin said that ""Russia has done everything to preserve the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" ""All these years (Russia) has persistently and patiently fought for the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015 to resolve the situation in Donbas. All in vain,"" he said. 
 
“Presidents, Rada deputies are changing, but the essence, the aggressive nationalist nature of the regime itself, which seized power in Kiev, does not change. It is entirely and completely a product of the 2014 coup d’état. do not recognize any other solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one,"" Putin added. 
 
According to the president, ""the ruling elite in Kiev constantly declares its unwillingness to implement the Minsk package of measures to resolve the conflict"" and is not interested in a peaceful resolution of the situation. 
 
""On the contrary, (she) is again trying to organize a blitzkrieg in the Donbas, as it already happened in 2014-2015. We remember how these adventures ended then,"" Putin said. 
 
He noted that now not a single day goes by without shelling the settlements of Donbass, attack drones, heavy equipment, rockets, artillery and multiple rocket launchers are used. 
 
""The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women, the elderly, do not stop. As we say, there is no end in sight to this. And the so-called civilized world, of which our Western colleagues self-appointedly declared themselves to be the only representatives, prefers this not As if this horror, the genocide that almost 4 million people are subjected to, does not exist,"" Putin said.",False,1645474434.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hxva9ps,,1,62,0,62,0,0,

Russia is willing to step in to guarantee this territorial integrity and it succinctly recognises the territory of these two independent states as being precisely what they themselves claim is their territory. In some places Ukrainian forces are occupying positions within this territory so now it becomes a situation of “Ukraine is occupying the territory of these sovereign states”. 

If Ukraine so much as fires a round or shell while in that territory they can claim that Ukraine is acting belligerently against these states and use that as an excuse to escalate hostilities.

Whether you agree or not is a matter of perspective but Russia has played this situation about as well as they could in terms of providing themselves flimsy political cover for their actions.

Technology for tracking shells back to origin is fairly old.  I don't think anyone B.S. this.  It is not that hard for Russian operatives to sneak into Ukraine and shoot something.  Restrained counter battery is not casus belli unless Russia intended to attack anyway.  

Everyone who has artillery from any country should restrain themselves.   It is a bomb.  It is not terrorism only because of limited definitions of the term.",False,1645489791.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hxw7nd1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

There are two general outcomes right now:

1) Russia sends in its troops as ""peacekeepers"" in the contested regions, you see small scale conflict until said regions ask Russia for annexation, and eventually Ukraine/NATO backs down in order to preserve peace for the rest of the involved regions. Ukraine (and the West) take a global beating and accept it, but order is (generally) maintained.

&#x200B;

What I'm not sure is that a full scale invasion beyond the territory Russia already de-facto controls. Mostly because every serious military analyst told the same thing. An invasion will be very costly. Even with the advantages russian military has, it will be hard (and absolutely horrific for Ukraine). Russia is unable to take major cities without either reducing them to rubble or suffering urban warfare and all the bloody mess it entails. Either of these options is a massive loss.

So I really truly hope this is just annexation of these small regions. But I don't know, Putin may be truly out of touch. If he does invade... I don't see Russia existing after his regime falls. And every regime will eventually fall. Shit.

It's about... err, 5 hours long?  But it goes into great detail about how the eastern front of WW2 was, by itself, the bloodiest conflict in human history.  It helps understand the psychology of Soviet citizens from that era who survived, and helps you understand why the Russians/Soviets want their border as far to the west as they can possibly get it.

As for what you should look for, generally anything as flight tracking is a fun hobby. In this instance, however, you probably want to find military aircraft. Right now you could try and track RAGGY81 for example. You will soon get a feel for which icons could be military aircraft and which are likely civilian. AFAIK there's no proper way to filter between the two. You can also look at the Callsigns when hovering above an aircraft icon to determine whether this would be worth watching or not (i.e. all RyanAir flights start with RYR, British military RAF start with RRR). Have fun tracking and I promise you'll spot quite a few interesting planes!

The only real difference is the Russian reliance on more sophisticated ground power and the fact that Ukrainians might fortify their cities instead of surrendering them quickly like the Iraqis, which would force Russia to perhaps siege them over a period of weeks or even months.

The Kremlin cut off diplomatic ties with Ukraine and has refused to meet them. That doesn’t exactly indicate Putin wants to cut a deal.

The most significant part of the buildup isn’t near the Donbas. Russian mil forces posture points to maximalist aims as well.

>Russia will go this route to avoid the crippling Western sanctions since he didn't really ""invade"" anybody

Sanctions were mentioned earlier during the meeting of Russia’s national security council. They already said they’re ready to endure sanctions for this.

>both sides get what they want, and Macron and Scholz will get the Nobel Peace Prize and everybody goes home happy, The End!

Putin doesn’t want the Donbas. He wants a complete political reorientation in Kyiv. His military forces are pointed at Kyiv.

The Kremlin has said Russia’s president Vladimir Putin plans to recognise the independence of two Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine — a step that could dramatically increase the risk of full-scale war with Kyiv.  
The decision, announced after a televised meeting of Russia’s security council, came in response to pleas from the leaders of the self-proclaimed People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk for Putin to recognise them as independent states and protect them from what they said was a planned offensive by Ukraine to retake them. Ukraine has denied this and said Russia was trying to use the allegation — and renewed hostilities by its proxies — as a pretext for a renewed invasion.  
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in eastern Ukraine since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Ukraine and western countries have said there was evidence that Russia had been providing weapons and fighters to fuel the separatist war, which Moscow denies.  
What are the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics?  
Self-proclaimed but almost wholly reliant on the Kremlin for support, Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics declared independence from Kyiv in April 2014 after Russia-backed militias seized control of local government offices and other infrastructure following Moscow’s invasion of Crimea.  
Bordering Russia on Ukraine’s eastern flank, the largely Russian-speaking regions are home to more than 3mn people and have received large amounts of financial, humanitarian and military assistance from the Kremlin. Moscow’s support for the regions came after the pro-western Maidan movement toppled Ukraine’s pro-Russian president in February 2014.  
Under the Minsk agreements — peace talks brokered by France and Germany — a ceasefire left the separatists in de facto control of roughly a third of the Ukrainian administrative districts of Donetsk and Luhansk, with a heavily fortified line of control separating them from Ukrainian troops.  
Ukraine describes the regions as “temporarily occupied territories” and the Minsk agreements envisage their eventual return to Kyiv. But both Kyiv and Moscow have failed to implement the terms of the agreements, leaving the status of the territories in limbo.  
At the same time, Russia has spent the past eight years increasing its leverage over the territories. It has given out passports and citizenship to around 800,000 of their citizens, Russian officials said on Monday, while stressing the need for the Kremlin to protect them.

Why would recognition by Moscow be important?  
Moscow has in the past stepped back from recognition, preferring instead to exert indirect control and use the territories as leverage in its wider disputes with Ukraine and the west.  
Recognition will probably bring two major initial outcomes. First, the collapse of the Minsk agreements and hopes for a diplomatic solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. On Monday, a stream of senior officials told Putin that they believed there was no prospect for the peace deal to be fully implemented, something they said gave Moscow no choice but to take other measures.  
Second, it would give the Kremlin justification to send Russian troops and military equipment into the territories. That would be likely to increase the risk of full conflict between Moscow and Kyiv along an already active front line.  
A bigger problem emerges in the medium-term: the two statelets each claim all of the Ukrainian districts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia has not made clear whether it is acknowledging their claims to territory under Kyiv’s control.  
How will the west respond?  
Nato and the EU have warned that recognition of the breakaway regions would be a big escalation in the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, while some European officials have called for it to be a trigger for a threatened sanctions package against Russia.  
Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said last week that recognition would represent “a blatant violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty” and breach international law. Such a move would be “an open escalation”, said Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, adding it “should be met with swift and decisive sanctions” if approved by Putin.  
However the EU, US, UK and other western countries have previously said that major sanctions threatened against Moscow would be deployed in the event of a military attack on Ukraine itself and there has been no public agreement on how to respond in the event of recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Why is this happening now?  
After a major Russian military build-up close to the borders of Ukraine, western governments have warned for weeks that Donetsk and Luhansk could be used to create a pretext for war, either by provoking a response from Kyiv or staging a “false flag” attack that Russia could blame on Ukraine.  
Russia has denied it plans to invade but insisted that the west agree to a number of security guarantees, such as banning Ukraine from ever joining Nato and withdrawing Nato troops from alliance members close to Russia.  
Moscow has previously seen the two statelets as an insurance policy in Ukraine. It has demanded that their return to Ukraine would come with their veto over major foreign policy decisions, notably Kyiv’s application to join Nato, which is a red line for Moscow.  
Their recognition by Putin now ratchets up the threat of conflict with Kyiv.  
What does this mean for diplomatic efforts to avert war between Russia and Ukraine?  
The move suggests Putin has lost faith in diplomatic efforts to avert further conflict in Ukraine, led in recent days by French president Emmanuel Macron. The future of the two statelets is seen as a critical area for compromise in any negotiated solution and recognition would appear to end that possibility.  
Dmitry Medvedev, deputy secretary of Russia’s security council and a former president, made it clear on Monday that he thought Russia should proceed regardless of the risk of conflict and fallout.  
“The scale of potential conflict can be compared with what we faced in 2008 \[with Georgia\],” he told Putin. “But now we know what is going to happen . . . all the sanction ideas that we can hear now broadcast \[from the west\].”  
“But we know how to withstand this pressure,” he said.",False,1645474658.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hxvh4e6,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

- Russia and Ukraine has a long history together.   
- Ukraine is not even a real country because there was no legitimate reason for the Soviets to separate it from Russia.

- Russia are good and trying to be diplomatical. But NATO is being bad and will not listen because they only want to suppress the greatness of Russia.  
- He (Putin) wants NATO to move all offensive weaponry away from Russia and back to the positions they were in back in the '90s.   
- Russia has every reason to fear that Ukraine will pursue nuclear and that they are more likely than any other nation to succeed with it, thanks to old Soviet technology they have available and with help from NATO.

I was only 14 at that time, so may not remember much details, and when the shells started to hit close to our home my family decided to move to Western Ukraine.Then it was pretty much just yours regular frozen conflict with nothing happening, untill now.

We live in a different era. World economies are so tightly wound together, that the actually strong countries will do everything in their hand to stop a global conflict. Even hard-line countries like China will eventually step in to stop it, because it's against their long-term goals -- Russia doesn't get to pull the world in when other players dominate the stage.

As for nukes, they basically mean it's over for everyone. Stop and think; all these rich people building up their yachts and spaceships, would they allow that to happen? Bunkers aren't going to cut it if nukes start flying from every direction. This isn't some conspiracy theory. Money talks louder than weapons. 

Last but not least, global appetite for war is extremely low. Other than nationalists and those brainwashed by propaganda, I don't know many young people who would be happy to leave their relatively comfortable lives and pick up a gun to shoot someone they might have been playing online games with.

* Allowing NATO expansion eastwards

Those are the ones that come off the top of my head.  Now, with those said, I'd comment that each country has the right to choose their own alliances, so NATO expansion eastwards along with military deployments to help guarantee the security of our allies is perfectly fine and reasonable from my (American) point of view.  The pursuit of ABM programs to help deter Iranian and North Korean missiles also makes a lot of sense from where we're standing.

However, even though its no longer officially in effect, Sweden doesn't (officially) participate in offensive military operations, but instead acts as peace-keeping forces, medical personell or aids transports for humanitarian actions (see operations in Mali, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Afghanistan). Sweden has a very strong connection with NATO, participating in military-training and intelligence-exchange to name a couple of things, but actually joining the alliance would mean inevitably having to officially 'choose a side' and possibly partake in offensive military operations, breaking the (since 2009) non-official policy of neutrality.

The policy may no longer be official, but it's very much alive. Described by the US government, Sweden is ""Non-participants in military alliances during peacetime and neutral during wartime"", which has also been stated numerous times by politicians and officials in Sweden, especially when it concerned the debate about our armed forces. Pressure was put on politicians to either have a public vote to join NATO or stop dismantling our own arms-production and military. Now during the last years, the route of increased arms-production and a stronger military holds true as they have received a vast increase in funding. This clearly points towards the desire to keep Sweden strong enough to deter threats and keep acting as a mediator in conflicts.

Then again, for a very long time it has been almost impossible to even attempt joining NATO as the majority of Swedes would have voted against it in a public referendum (although this has actually started to change).

Due to these things, I strongly believe Sweden will stay away from joining NATO as long as possible, but the strong links to US/UK intelligence and military indicate that Sweden will most likely end up joining their side if they *have* to choose.

It would require a radical change of industry, its not hearts of iron where you can just plunk down some factories and be done with it.

Things need to be produced, for which you would need at the least two things: raw materials and labor (capital is also a factor here, but we'll ignore that). If you can only import with crazy high prices, you can naturally produce less. On top of that labor wants to get paid, and people only want to get paid in money because it can buy them things. Food is the major thing here, but consumer goods (from computers and cars to furniture and children toys) is an important second. If Russia would somehow be able to produce enough food and military supplies to sustain their country, there would be no way they can also get enough consumer goods, not even talking about wages dropping themselves. Do you really expect that Putins Oligarch allies and his people would accept this just to go to war with Ukraine?

I don’t even feel hatred to common Russians who may feel nationalistic or that putins actions are justified.

And it’s impossible to always know what is true and what isn’t. 

I do feel sadness when looking at my country and around the world sometimes though, when I see all the hatred tearing people apart. Hatred promoted by more powerful groups to keep us from seeing everyone as simply human.

Earth's land area is 200 million square miles. if Russia launches every nuke, every nuke hits its target (no straying off course, successful launch, not being shut down, no failures to detonate etc... modern weapons fail as much as 20% of the time). Then 0.4% of Earth's land area is affected. They will be unable to destroy every NATO military asset, they will be unable to stop NATO armies. 

Nukes are simply ineffective way to wage war. It completely unties hands of NATO to obliterate Moscow. This is political suicide. Use of nukes results in Russia being split like Germany was post WW2, in its complete loss of an army, its every politician or general getting the firing squad. Hit land will be habitable within 100 years. South America, Africa, Asia will be completely untouched. To take out even a moderately large city you would have to use at least 5 nukes. Something like LA is 35,000 square miles. thats 90 nukes bro.

Nukes will not be used. Russia and US has fought several proxy wars during the Cold War. Nukes were not even on the table.

We know what Putin's plan is. He has been saying it for the last 15 years. Reunification of USSR under one Russia.

Maybe in the West this isnt clear. Being Russian all this is plain as day.

My last point. You do realize nukes work both ways right? Its not like Russia can use nukes without being nuked as well. Except the world has one target. Russia. But Russia would have to target dozens of countries with its 2000 nukes (most of which are low yield and will affect an area smaller than 400 square miles).",1645488452.0,1645487684.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hxwazl2,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

I was referring to ""1917"" here as a mark of the start of the Civil War in Russia. Now what happened in 1918/19 was...

Ukraine was ruled by the UNR (Directory), the capitalist government of Ukraine, that was supported by Germany and after Germany surrendered, they were left on its own. However, they had ridiculous claims over the territory they never controlled in the east.

In Russia there was a civil war. The fractions were the Reds, the Whites, the UNR, and the Greens.

The Whites were supported by the UK and France and their position was ""no ukraine, it's all Russia"". 

The UNR were a weak government on its own

The Reds were supported by no foreign power but they lured the Ukrainian nationalists by giving them all the territorial claims at the expense of Russia. It was then assured by the USSR Constitution and this is the territory Ukraine has today (except Crimea, Ukraine got it later, in the 1950s). 

BTW the Whites lost... not because of Ukraine, but because they were corrupt and were the worse human rights abusers than Reds.

Neither of them posed a threat to the same capacity as Finland was to the Soviets, or in case of a conflict, Sweden to Nazi Germany. Sweden was well-prepared in comparison to its two neighbours, with a good army, a good air force and due its sparse population it would be able to last far longer than Denmark's six hours or Norway's 62 days. To avoid a bloody battle, Sweden did just like you said, sell iron-ore to Nazi Germany, vital to their campaigns, but meanwhile aided greatly in smuggling jews out of occupied territories and provided humanitarian aid. Sweden aided both sides to ensure that very neutrality. Sweden wasn't 'spared' by Nazi Germany, but took a strong neutral stance which made the losses outweigh the gain of an invasion for the Nazis.

The same goes for today. Like I said, either Sweden joins NATO or once again builds up its army, because a good army and local arms-production is vital in order to ensure neutrality (which both Denmark and Norway were lacking during ww2). If the attackers have more to lose than gain from an attack on a neutral country, they won't attack. Just like Nazi Germany, I strongly believe the same would be true in the case with Russia.

The Swedish stance has worked for over 200 years so I don't see the point of abandoning it altogether before it's clear that it's absolutely necessary.",1645526700.0,1645480226.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hxvs7et,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

I really don't think I've read anything that's so grossly, dangerously misinformed about something so obvious. You are literally the only person I've ever encountered in my entire life who has downplayed nuclear war to this absurd extent.

The fact that you think the effects of nuclear war are contained to the immediate area of a blast, as if they're just conventional bombs, tells me you have no clue what you're talking about. You also claimed Russia's nuclear arsenal is a third of its real size (6,257). It doesn't matter what total percentage of landmass can be nuked, what matters is that Russia could wipe out the entirety of population centers in America, and vice versa. Both countries could wipe each other off the map and could doom the entire planet to nuclear winter

Consider this:

>**Even a regional nuclear war,** such as between India and Pakistan \[Robock et al., 2007b; Toon et al., 2019\], **in which less than 3% of the world’s nuclear weapons were detonated**, **would suddenly decrease the average global temperature by 1°C–7°C, precipitation by up to 40%, and sunlight by up to 30%**. No matter the scale of the soot injection into the skies, the multiyear lifetime of smoke in the stratosphere means the effects on climate would last a decade, with the largest impacts continuing for more than 5 years. **Such a conflict would decrease crop production to an extent that it could seriously threaten world food security and even trigger global famine**

It seems like persnickety, but it's an important distinction in order to avoid confusion, and that's what happened here, there are Russian troops in LNR/DNR, but no troop movement yet toward the territory of these ""republics"" claims.

 Gaddafi for instance definitely wasn’t a dictator who funneled money into his own supporters hands and his own hands. He definitely wasn’t corrupt, he definitely didn’t refuse to give his citizens any kind of rights. The unrest in that country definitely wasn’t a combination of Arab spring protests, with the spark lighting the whole powder keg off being the unjust arrest of a human rights lawyer. For sure man it was allll the U.S. not shitty dictators, and citizens revolting. 

As for milosevic, he was the first head of state to be *charged with war crimes* his entire reign was filled with corruption, political assassinations, and state police brutality. Also he was overthrown peacefully, after he rigged the election. The only form of U.S. intervention here was campaign funding for the opposition, a grand total of 41 million dollars. Ooooo wow. What a bloody take over by the U.S. 

Now onto Syria. Where like a lot of these things in the Middle East, the Arab spring caused mass protests and the citizens of Syria to ask for ya know, basic political rights back. Maybe even possibly the could get a real government going instead of a dictatorship. This was met with lethal violence by Assad. As such the country broke in Two, and a civil war began. Assad has been firmly anti west, and I don’t think that’s really a bad precedent for the United States to side against him. 

And just as a heads up. In all of these conflicts, this leaders are dictators. They are people who were in power, who abused their power. They abused and silenced their people. The killed and stole from their country. It’s not some small take over of some socialist utopia, and the people in these wanted this. 

You’re examples are the equivalent of someone saying that the French caused the American revolution, and toppled the British rule and that the American people didn’t actually want to become their own country.

Its pretty apparent how fearmongered you are. Because you are quoting numbers that make no sense. What you claim to lower global temps by 1-7C has been denotated already through testing throughout 20th century. pretty sure we dont have 1 let alone 7 degree decreases in temp.

But hey, I guess you have to fearmonger for it to work as a deterrent. 

And you are factually wrong about Russia wiping out entirety of population centers in America. They dont have near the amount of nukes required for that. I already said Los Angeles alone would take 90 nukes. Thats 1/20th of all their nukes. US has thousands of large cities. 20% of US population/military is abroad. They gotta target those.

Still even with US is a smoldering ruins, South America, Africa, Asia are perectly fine. No reason to target anything there (and even if there was. not enough nukes Boris).

And no Im not saying this as someone that lives far away from where nukes would fall. I live in a city that would most definitely be nuked. But hey, if I happen to be in the 5 mile radius of a nuke... I guess it was just my time to go.

Maybe Im not afraid of nukes because i know noone will ever use them. They work both ways. if US is reduced to a rubble, then whoever attacked is reduced to a rubble. So what was the point? My reductionist point was precisely that nukes are not an effective tool of war. You cant win a war with nukes. Therefore they wont be used. They help prevent war. Not during one.

In the Middle East I think the blame lies mostly on specific member countries than on NATO itself. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, the root cause of ISIS, was not a NATO operation but a US/UK adventure. NATO involvement in that country was mostly in cleaning up the mess afterwards.

And we shouldn’t be hoping for an Arab spring type revolution to happen in Russia since that would likely bring in an even worse government. The average Russian just wants to live their life without conflict the same as the average American, the same as the average Brit, the same as the average Irishman. Any opposition against Putin has been killed or imprisoned (remember Navalny?). Why don’t people just fight back against Kim in North Korea? Why don’t people just fight back against Xi? Why didn’t people just fight back against Trump or Biden? It’s not so simple and to hate someone because they want to live a life of no conflict is small minded. You go fight against Putin if you want it so bad.",False,1645561983.0,t3_sy1xea,t1_hy09p6k,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
