Former Kremlin spin doctor Gleb Pavlovsky has died at the age of 71.

He helped oversee a shift in Russia to what he called ""managed democracy"", but what is widely considered to have been key to clearing the path for Vladimir Putin's authoritarian rule.

While he initially believed they would avoid major political upheaval, he later expressed regret for his role in establishing the changes.

""It's like those who work on designing a weapon,"" he said of the system he created.

""These weapons can end up in the wrong hands or be used the wrong way. Are you responsible because you made the weapon?""

Speaking to the Globe and Mail in 2012, he said: ""The system was supposed to be temporary. … But the further it went, the more human passion came into play. I should have read more Plato.

> As part of Microsoft Flight Simulator’s ongoing digital preservation efforts, we are pleased to introduce the world’s largest aircraft, the Ukrainian-built Antonov An-225 Mriya today. It is an ultra-heavy lift jet transport aircraft featuring six engines, holds the record as the world’s longest plane and many other size-related aviation records. Only one Mriya was ever completed, and it was rendered catastrophically inoperable in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Efforts are underway to attempt to rebuild the aircraft and fly it again.

>  
>Myth 1: Ukraine cannot win back all territory, including Crimea.  
Reality: Ukrainians have repeatedly shown that they can restore territorial integrity, given the necessary weapons and training. Our support can be decisive. The ball is in our court. Ukraine can win.  
>  
>Myth 2: Russia is unbeatable.  
Reality: Ukraine's allies have only committed a tiny fraction of their resources. The combined Nordic-Baltic GDP alone is bigger than Russia's. Manufacture can be ramped up. Russia could and should be defeated.  
>  
>Myth 3: Russia will get tired and want to settle.  
Reality: Putin's goals have not changed. He still believes he can achieve them. He will only settle as a timeout before the next aggression. He will keep reigniting the conflict. He announced a crusade, so he cannot stop.  
>  
>Myth 4: Crimea is a red line for Putin.  
Reality: Putin has announced many red lines. He threatened enormous consequences if Ukraine's allies sent any help, but his red lines kept evaporating. Internationally agreed borders must be respected without fear. Crimea is Ukraine.  
>  
>Myth 5: We can return to business as usual with Putin.  
Reality: Putin is far too heavily invested in his crusade against the West. He sees our peace offerings as weakness and uses them against us. He cannot turn back. He should be in court, not in power.  
>  
>Myth 6: All wars end with negotiations.  
Reality: WWII didn't end with negotiations. Peace can only be sustainable if Putin is defeated. Ongoing talks with Putin would lead only to recurring conflict. Swift, full victory is the only guarantee of lasting peace.  
>  
>Myth 7: The Baltics and Poland only want revenge.  
Reality: After centuries of Russian aggression, we want security. We know we cannot expect security without a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.  
It's simple: Peace means respecting borders.  
>  
>Forcing Ukraine to betray part of her citizenry would not be just nor bring peace. Such ""agreements"" only lay the foundations of the next conflict. That is why we ask Ukraine's allies to commit fully to a complete Ukrainian victory. This is the only true option.

Russian MoD reported a day later that ""the commander responsible for working with the servicemen has been identified. Individual conversations were held.

>*Like birds, microprocessors often take a circuitous route to arrive at their destination. Controlling where they fly to is proving difficult.*  
>  
>The U.S. invented microchips and it has threatened sanctions on anyone who sells many, if not most, varieties to Russia. Still, recent leaks—and some publicly available data—make clear that they keep showing up on Russian shores. At the center of the trade is China and, allegedly, a few other intermediary countries such as Turkey.  
>  
>The adaptability of global trade networks in response to sanctions and tariffs isn’t a new story: For another recent example, look no further than global energy markets, which have adapted with remarkable speed to the West’s decision to wean itself off Russian energy. But stemming the flow of semiconductors—which power both everyday appliances and military equipment—into Russia presents a particularly tough problem.  
>  
>One key reason is that China, which has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia, sits at the center of the global chip trade. It is the world’s electronics factory floor and the largest global importer of chips, as well as a significant manufacturer of low-end chips itself. Its publicly available export statistics also omit comprehensive information on overseas business partners.  
>  
>Public data does show a certain number of semiconductor devices, for example, continuing to flow to Russia—but not who sold them or whether they were in fact sanctioned items. That makes curbing the flow of semiconductors from China to Russia—directly or via third countries “repackaged” as new goods—extremely difficult without completely halting chip exports to China and bringing the world’s electronics industry to a crashing halt.  
>  
>What is clear is that, after a dip in early 2022 following the U.S.’s initial sanctions, Russia’s semiconductor imports have rebounded strongly, and Chinese companies play a key role. Leaked Russian customs records show that Russia’s imports of chips and chip components were nearing their prewar monthly average by late 2022, more than half of which came from China. And publicly available Chinese customs data show that integrated-circuit shipments to Russia were valued at $179 million in 2022—against just $74 million in 2021.

> What we need to do is inject greater energy and resolve to defend what is important to us. And that means putting this fire out in Ukraine. It's taken us one year just to start thinking about getting tanks and heavy weapons to Ukraine -- this should've happened months ago! We're too risk-averse, and that has been exploited by our adversaries.

[4:00]
> When you're talking about military assistance, this is tactical. Tactical assistance needs to have a purpose, to be part of a strategy. Let's begin by confirming what success looks like. To me, that's the liberation of Donbas, followed by Crimea, allowing Ukraine to become a sovereign nation again. Anything less than that, Putin will take as a success.

[4:44]
> Thinking more strategically: getting that port of Odessa open. The reason why we're having a cost-of-living crisis here is because the grain isn't getting out, oil and gas have gone up as well, and it's all linked. It's in our interest to support Ukraine.

[5:51]
> NATO has been forced to sit on its hands, it's been benched, unable to participate because of the veto that Turkey and Hungary possess. One year ago we had two nations (Sweden and Finland) wanting to join, and it still hasn't happened. That shows how the most formidable military alliance the world has ever seen is unable to lean in and protect a democracy that's inside Europe as well. Hiding behind this idea that because Ukraine wasn't a member of NATO then it's not our fight. Is *is* our fight, it concerns us. Putin is the most destabilizing force in Europe now, affecting security, affecting all our economies. It's NATO's job to defend democracies in Europe, and indeed beyond.

[6:49]
> If we're not able to do it through NATO, there must be a coalition of the willing. There is another group called the Joint Expeditionary Force, which Britain leads in fact, with ten like-minded nations (including the Baltics). That, for me, would be the answer: invite Ukraine to join that immediately.

[7:50]
> You go back to 2007, at the Munich Security Conference. In the speech that Putin gave, he spelled out what he wanted to do: he wanted to rekindle that sense of ownership over the Slavic parts of Europe, the former Warsaw Pact countries. It's been very clear what mission he's been on, and we've been spooked by his language.

[9:11]
> That's exactly where we could end up if we allow Russia to continue controlling the agenda. The only way you can change that is by ensuring that Ukraine is able to regain terrain. [...] If we're not committed enough, this becomes a frozen conflict, Ukraine is then stuck with a loss of territory, Russia can then declare some form of success, and this drags out. [...] It's up to us to show greater resolve, provide the equipment that's needed *immediately*. Air power is fantastic, F-16s we've touched on, Typhoons are fantastic, but this is gonna take months if not years. There are other forms of air power, not just fast jets, that could allow Ukraine to liberate the Donbas and then the Crimea.

[10:29]
> Then the message goes to Russia: the West will support democracies that are attacked by aggressors, and that's a powerful message to China. Don't forget: they're watching all of this very carefully indeed, given what their interests are in their neck of the woods.

[11:00]
> People like myself (and I hope the government as well) need to make the case about the vicinity between our economy, our prosperity, and our security. They are all aligned now: we dropped our guard, and because we embraced globalization for the last couple of decades, we're gonna lose access to those supply chains, lose access to our markets, and that will affect us here.

*Also, on Transnistria:*

The most interesting and insightful thing I’ve read recently about Transnistria was from VolyaMedia.^1   There were several points I’d didn’t know, including that in the first few months of the war, Romania had permitted Russians access.^2  Also, was the state of [un]readiness and the [un]willingness of the Russians and those separatists to fight, the state of those stockpiles, and discussions of force.  You can find it here: https://t\.me/volyamedia/532 

Second, an underground source^3 asked his followers (Odessa likely) to give him information and drew a map.  It was highly unusual, and it was Transnistria and borders of Ukraine.   See here: https://t\.me/vanek_nikolaev/12209  He’s been know to pass information on to the GUR and likely, this was the purpose.

________

^1 ^(VolyaMedia a conglomerate of military and academic personnel from Baltics, Ukraine and Russia and is intended as military analysis for Russian intellectuals, and as a counter to Russian propaganda.  They have contacts currently in both Ukrainian and Russian high command, and are referenced by other military analysts [IS.W] so I trust them as credible.)

^2 ^(Generally,) [^(this is how Russians get access to Transnistria.)](https://odessa-journal.com/oleg-zhdanov-how-russian-troops-in-transnistria-are-supplied/)

^3  ^(He’s not really a milblogger, but considered credible by local press.  He started reporting underground happenings, often in code, advice for resistance, initially was just Mykolaiv Oblast. As gained following, expanded to be Zaporozhye, Kherson and Odessa, and has proven to be reliable enough that the local Ukrainian press cite him.)",1677534811.0,1677532440.0,t3_11d2851,t3_11d2851,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

e61e3fa1c93925ba758ad08281b58b4b,11d2851,ja8j3sr,"The Soviet Union first and Russia later has been playing this game where they try to foment discontent and unrest through support for fringe and/or activist groups of all kinds around the world since at least the 1960s, often even groups on opposite sides of the same issue. They have enjoyed some measurable success in amplifying natural divisions in to destabilizing discontent with that strategy.



But now they’re trying a new tack. Russia wants to use the fact that they have the ears of various groups in to action that benefits Russia directly, and not merely to destabilize their adversaries. Recent examples include the “anti-war” rally in Berlin, and the positions of the far-right in The States. Russia is looking to get tangible results from these efforts, looking to change public opinion, change policy, not just get people riled up.



They aren’t anywhere near as good at this game as they were at the destabilization game. You only need to know one thing about someone to get them riled up… what riles them up. But changing their entire world-view is a much steeper climb.





I see this in the way Mitch McConnell seems to be panicking. For 60 years, the Republican Party has been cultivating an image for themselves as strong on defense, and portraying the Democratic Party as weak on defense. That is why Mitch instinctively criticizes President Biden for not doing enough to support Ukraine. But now he’s got a big chunk of his coalition actively trying to help Russia who want to paint Biden as doing too much. They want to paint Democrats as being too strong on defense, and to re-brand the Republican Party as the foreign-policy doves.



But you don’t just un-do 60 years of hard-fought branding all of a sudden like that. Mitch, correctly I think, realizes that Putin doesn’t give a rats ass about the long-term viability of the Republican Party in the United States. Prior to this war, Russia valued the continued existence of their assets. But now they want results, and they’re willing to sacrifice their pawns to get it.



What they’re going to get is nothing. They’re bad at this game because they never actually bothered to understand these groups that they were working with. Russia is going to lose their useful idiots like so many mobniks in Bakhmut, sacrificed for nothing on the altar of Putin’s megalomaniacal ambitions.",False,1677518012.0,t3_11d2851,t3_11d2851,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

> India, Iran, Brazil, South Korea, Australia, Mexico, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Switzerland, Argentina, Thailand, Israel, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, South Africa, Philippines

 * India certainly won't side with China, they've functionally been at war with China for a while now.
 * Iran would.
 * Brazil PROBABLY would, hard to tell. Depends on the current president.
 * South Korea would not side with China, that whole ""China supports NK"" thing.
 * Australia would largely not side with China, they've been having a bit of an economic back and forth already.
 * Mexico would likely not (or not be allowed to, might be a better descriptor). NAFTA and such.
 * Indonesia, I don't know enough about them to guess.
 * Saudi Arabia would do so at peril of losing access to Western weapons, and they absolutely don't want that.
 * Turkey PROBABLY sides with the west after a long period of waffling.
 * Switzerland probably takes a long time, but eventually drags in with the rest of the west.
 * Argentina probably goes with China, but is somewhat unstable.
 * Thailand, my read is wouldn't go with China but I don't know enough to assert that.
 * Israel waffles but goes with the West, they need Western support more than they need Chinese goods.
 * Nigeria I don't know enough about to say.
 * UAE likely goes west (those weapons...) but still exports oil to China anyway till they get yelled at enough.
 * Egypt PROBABLY goes China.
 * Bangladesh I don't know enough about.
 * Malaysia I don't know enough about.
 * Singapore I feel goes West, but that's a weak assertion.
 * Vietnam I THINK goes West but similarly weak assertion.
 * South Africa probably goes China until the West dangles enough money, but this is based off the unresearched assumption that they are receiving Chinese loans for the Belt And Road initiative (if I remember the name right).
 * Philippines probably goes west, but a weak assertion.

Googling Russian statistics

100% of Russians reportedly have access to electricity. 

85% have access to internet. 

93% of Americans have access to internet. 

76% of Russians have clean drinking water

99% of American households have running water. 

80% of Russian households have running water.

75% of Russian households have drinkable water.

So Russia you probably still have decent sized villages with very limited services. In America it’s likely very rural areas. I’m in Canada and largely for us it’s middle of nowhere up north often native reserves that have drinking water problems.

Government is very much about rule of law - it depends heavily on the rules of law being followed for its own survival (see: it’s water contracts, and territorial disputes with Malaysia) and thus will heavily side with whatever is the opinion of the ICJ and/or any other international ruling body it is a part of like the UN.

However there is a main challenge with Singapore’s position that it didn’t necessarily have to deal with in the Russian decision: it has a sizable population of ethnic Chinese. A fair few of these are naturalized immigrants from the PRC. Quite a sizable number of ethnic Chinese also exhibit a sino-nationalistic slant: for example showing public support for China in putting down the Hong Kong protests. 

So my take on the government is that they will most likely make some public statements about remaining neutral, and abstain from any votes.

> Hellish battles continue in all sectors of defense. 

> The situation in the **north** of the city remains the most threatening. Today, was possible to slow down the enemy's breakthrough—a little bit. This has bought us precious time, despite the fact that the enemy's movement has not yet been completely stopped there. 

> [**West**:] Between Ivanovsky and Stupochky, to the south and east of Ivanovsky, the assaults of the occupiers were repulsed, the situation in these sectors stabilized a little. 

> The situation is very difficult on the **eastern** bank of Bakhmutka—our units are being pushed out from that bank. But for now, it is possible to keep the main positions there. 

> In the **south**,  our guys are counterattacking.  The Defense Forces carried out effective counterattacks, during which it was possible to improve the tactical position somewhat. Especially in the Ivanovo district. And this is very good news. And although this is still a small promotion, it is very gratifying!

Whether Russia wins or loses, ultimately market economies and arbitrage means that this discount is unlikely to be permanent (although if Russia ""wins"" the fallout effects are likely to interrupt trade with the west for longer).   If Russia loses, it's very likely that reparations etc. will be negotiated to the benefit of the west and e.g. include all of Ukraine's costs of defending itself, including repaying debts to the folks who loaned it all kinds of stuff.  Lend lease isn't called give lease by accident. 

So the longer it goes on, the longer China's discount period lasts. 

China's interests would be nicely served by keeping this thing going for decades if they can.  This also explains the schitzophrenic bot activity in the infosphere... because the Russian botmeistrs want this over, and the Chinese do not.",False,1677537904.0,t3_11d2851,t1_ja9v2ul,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

As a separate country before they fucked themselves Russia had a usefulness to China as an ally in a geopolitical sense.

Now in their current or in a reduced state they're a liability, and Siberia won't make up for that. It'd just be more of an exposed front line they'll need to defend in any conflict rather than having an ally at their back.

russian aviation doesn’t suffer from so much a lack of airframes as much as it is suffering from a lack of pilots. in the beginning, a lot of aircraft were taken out by UKR MANPADs. some aircraft were targeted by strikes on airports. at best most aircraft activity is from far behind lines of engagement and usually to launch missiles which glide about 40-70km which tends to leave the launching aircraft safe from anti-air.

there’s also reports that in the beginning of the war some VVS (russian air force) pilots were extremely anxious about making sortie runs not only due to anti air from ukraine but also friendly fire from their own comrades. and that’s gone both ways: infantry have complained about friendly fire artillery strikes. there’s been a couple of instances of payload from VVS aircraft dropping on RU forces on the ground",1677512364.0,1677507550.0,t3_11d2851,t1_ja7s8ep,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

The simple answer is that speculating numbers and producing effective forces are not the same

So yes. If Russia starts getting even more desperate they can find and field more people to fight. But will they really grind down their society to nothing for this offensive war that might not have that positive of an outcome? Russia hasn't even declared formal war and are struggling with the idea of how much to commit or not.

Personally my impression isn't that they are literally running out of men but rather trained troops, certain ammunition and equipment and whatever structures they have in place to replenish that is slow or incapable.

> Though there had been popular support for the war among the Russian public following the Japanese attack at Port Arthur in 1904, that popular support soon turned to discontent after suffering multiple defeats at the hands of the Japanese forces. For many Russians, the immediate shock of unexpected humiliation at the hands of Japan caused the conflict to be viewed as a metaphor for the shortcomings of the Romanov autocracy. Popular discontent in Russia after the war added more fuel to the already simmering Russian Revolution of 1905, an event Nicholas II had hoped to avoid entirely by taking intransigent negotiating stances prior to coming to the table. Twelve years later, that discontent boiled over into the February Revolution of 1917.

That’s because authoritarian regimes don’t really have true “allies.” Democracies know that they can grow together, prosper together and their shared values mean they won’t end up killing each other. They also know that if they are attacked their allies will come to their defense and generally the militaries of strong democracies will follow the laws and not overthrow the government.

For dictatorship it’s completely different. They maintain power both domestically and internationally through military force and they have no true allies or shared values with other countries that will compel them to look after each other. All alliances are temporary for a dictatorship and disarming oneself to help an ally is almost always a threat to one’s own power.

That’s not to say democracies will always triumph over dictatorships but there are certain advantages that stem from having a values based democracy and a commitment to human rights.

- food for more than 400 million people, they can't produce enough food to serve the population, it depends on imports to survive
- raw material of any kind
- energy

China manufacturers a lot, but many  companies are already moving out of China, and more are coming. It is likely both the EU and the US will have stimulation packages for companies that move outside of China, so that will be a serious issue for China.

It would be monumentally stupid for China to start supplying Ruzzia with lethal aid.

Fair enough, it probably works well enough for the topic as is.

While we can sanction Ruzzia to the bone, it still has the ability to feed itself, as they are major exporter of food, and they have immense reserves of energy, so they will never be dependent on anyone for this.

At the same time Ruzzia has too many reserves of metals and other minerals that the world needs, so they can still trade those even if sanctioned, there are simply too many countries that need these resources.

China, however, is in a pickle.

It can't feed itself, it needs to import enough food to feed 400 million people, they simply don't have the capacity to produce enough food internally.

And China is reliant on imports for energy, coal, gas, oil, it needs to import a lot of them.

Playing the war game with Ruzzia would be monumentally stupid for China.

Don't misunderstand the situation, China really really wants to help Ruzzia, China would go head first if it could in order to help Ruzzia.

But the sanctions that would follow involvement would kick China's ass worse than what is happening to Ruzzia.

So China is angry, but obedient.

Yes I do; Russia's initial plan was to blitz with armor over frozen ground because in the mud they were going to be screwed via a blitz offensive. Once mud hit, their offensive was effectively dead, which is why they stalled and as they committed so much armor to the initial rushes. By the time the mud was gone they were already on the back foot with way less armor to do anything. Then Ukraine was able to use their mobility and better organization to counter, because their logistics and tactics are more effective in that scenario.

The current Russian strategy changed from blitz to grind. They dig in, they send in troops to find defensive positions, they bomb them, and then grind forward a few steps. They take insane losses this way, but Russia is simply back to throwing meat into the grinder, which is more of a sustainable approach for Russia than it is for Ukraine. Ukraine cannot match the death counter to be honest, it's a horrible way to fight.

Ukraine will have an advantage once they can reliably use their mobility to harass and break Russian positions without having to simply dig in and repel wave after wave of Russian suicide charges.

The Ukrainian army no doubt has elements of Soviet thinking left in it but 8 years of NATO training and a large reorganization in 2016 means that they have less of that mentality than Russia has left in its army. Both sides might use artillery more than western armies but for Ukraine that is as much of a byproduct of what they have to use than some sort of adherence to Soviet thinking.

And which side doesn't mind throwing their soldiers lives away in repeated frontal assaults? Which side is using convicts as prisoners? Which side has used blocking units to prevent soldiers retreating during suicidal attacks? All things the Soviets did and Russia does today. 

Meanwhile which side has tried to foster a large number of NCO's and give frontline officers more control of planning and discretion in carrying out orders? Which side clearly values their soldiers lives and refrains from suicidal attacks? That would be Ukraine.

Now don't get me wrong the Ukrainian's in terms of standards and mentality aren't a NATO army but they aren't a Soviet army anymore either, the Russians seem to fall into that category far more. I would in fact say a huge reason the invasion played out the way it did is because the Ukrainian military was more flexible, quicker to react to events and adapt to the Russian push to first halt it and then take back territory. Meanwhile Russia keeps bashing its own head in pursuing dubious goals over and over, they seem the total opposite of flexible and willing to throw large number of their own troops lives away to try and achieve victory, remind you of anyone?

The Ukrainian army is somewhere between a Soviet mentality and a NATO one but they're a hell of a lot less Soviet in their thinking and actions than the Russian army is.

After the initial invasion was halted Ukraine have avoided being encircled and losing large amounts of men and equipment, why do you think they will not be just as responsive in Bakhmut and leave if/when they need too? It's not the first time the Ukrainian's have made an orderly withdrawal under intense Russian assaults. It just seems like more alarmism that the Ukrainian army will suddenly forget all it's learned in the last year and stay there too long, if they haven't made the mistake before and avoided it several times seems like they will probably leave when they need too. Mauripol was surrounded very early in the war, the failure to leave then only seems to have made them make sure it wouldn't happen again. Trying to say some ""soviet mentality"" would cause them to stay too long when it hasn't in many months seems like... well just a line of thought that is grasping at straws to predict doom and gloom. Ukraine might lose Bakhmut but as recent history as shown they probably get out when they need too.

[This](https://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Warpac-Rus-PLA-ESM.html), while now dated a bit, shows the direction they were taking with ground based elint systems.

We (US) had real time high altitude drone footage (live), on station sat footage within 30 minutes of call and massive amounts of HUMINT on top way back in the olden days of 2005ish.

Being 2-3 decades behind in a tech like night vision is one thing, but they, at one time, had a working and coherent elint strategy with supporting platforms.

One of the Kings and Generals videos (I think the one about the battle for Kyiv) suggests that the early efforts to knock out Ukrainian air defense may have been more successful than is generally accepted, suggesting they did at one time have better tech out there,  but now the disparity between intel between the two combatants appears to be very, very large. Gives further credence to Michael Kofmans statement that the most important item provided by the west to Ukraine has been intel. Degrading Russia's information gathering capability being a focal point seems to be paying off as well.

Probably not. Before they finally gave in and started mobilizing, Russia was desperate for manpower and deployed its instructors to the frontlines. This is why the first batch of mobiks received essentially zero training and the rest got cycled through Belarus, whose army still possessed all its training staff.

There are men and women in their military who hold non-commissioned ranks, but they do not perform the same duties as western NCOs. Those duties are instead performed by junior commissioned officers like lieutenants.

They flirted with transitioning to a more western-style organization with empowered NCOs under a previous Minister of Defense in the early 2010s, but he apparently stepped on some toes and was removed, so his reforms never came to fruition.",False,1677534819.0,t3_11d2851,t1_ja93gxu,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Purpose-built combat drones like this are going to be very, very scary. Only question is what will the counters look like? Will these drones get tamed or not? 

We kind of see that battle played out with aircraft. Airplanes are scary, we invent things to combat them -- fighters, ground arty and sams. The operational goal is to achieve air superiority. US always ends up getting that in short order. I think this is the first huge conflict with modernish weapons where we see neither side having superiority and it gets wonky after that. 

If we see it in the small scale with drones then it's going to be attack drones and their supporting fighter drones up against the enemy and their attack and fighter drones (depending on weapons and tactics, they could be fighter-bomber drones all in one unit) and it's a matter of achieving momentary superiority to make attacks. Plus whatever ground defenses are available. 

I'm not seeing anyone suggesting broadly applicable counter-drone tech. There's talk about lasers maybe zotting them from the sky, like just burning out the sensors. Depends on cost and reliability.

I have to agree, and I'd say the same for Abrams tanks too.

In the conversations I've seen from some of the telegram groups from the guys at the front like Bakmut, it is not great. Ukraine is doing better than Russia of course, but they are still taking a lot of casualties in those areas. How sustain this rate is is unclear, I suspect a lot of the recent gains there were Wagner who now have way less access to gear and prisoners so perhaps the big Russia push will be stalled even more now, and things will improve vis a vie the casualty rates on the Ukranian side.

&#x200B;

>All indications are still that this war continues to go very badly for Russia, even when the Russians take their best possible choices to advance their strategic and political objectives.

No doubt. One thing to note is that the previous general was demoted to deputy under Gerasimov, who is a more willing general to throw pure bodies at problems. The lack of organized offensives coupled with WWII era tactics will mean Russia will just continue to stagnate and any terrain they do take will either not be held long, or will be lost when they are basically horse-whipped to keep pushing further and get liquidated.

Peter Zeihan made the observation that right now there is a certain parity of force as neither side has the real clear advantage to take the casualty ratio to a quick unsustainable level. Once Ukraine gets their more modern tanks and can use them, and Russia does their new round of conscription, you end up with the ""can the new tech beat out the horde approach"" scenario. If the new tanks and gear in Ukraine can crank the casualty ratio high enough, then Russia will simply be fucked due to bodies can no longer solve the problem even if they could get them.

Frankly, I think even if Russia manages some gains in the coming months, they are burning so much in terms of men and supplies to do so that I simply cannot imagine this being sustainable. The only risk is that Russian culture prides itself on being able to sacrifice and suffer, and I can see that they would need to lose WAY more soldiers before things at home really get wild...",False,1677566967.0,t3_11d2851,t1_jabl7uj,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

During the Battle of Britain, the Germans had a massively larger air force.  The British had to shorten training and rush pilots into combat.

However, after 6 months, the UK had more fighters and more pilots than they had before the battle started.

The Germans, despite superiority in numbers, weren't able to inflict operationally corrosive losses on the RAF.

Modern warfare is about force generation and regeneration.  The winning side will be able to inflict losses faster than the other side can regenerate those losses.

We compare country size.  But that comparison really isn't about manpower, because warfare very rarely inflicts demographically significant losses.  Especially if there is a defined front.

We compare country size because it so often correspondence to economic resiliency.  That a larger country can on average focus more economic power on military force regeneration than a smaller power.  This is what decides peer conflicts.

Human waves of Russians can only achieve something if they can inflict operationally corrosive casualties.
