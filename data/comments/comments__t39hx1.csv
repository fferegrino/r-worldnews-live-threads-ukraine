[Ruble collapses as new sanctions hit](https://www.axios.com/ruble-russia-currency-sanctions-asia-markets-putin-3732c934-76d8-4a12-ae9b-988fff864002.html)

>Russia's currency collapsed in overnight trading, with the ruble plummeting against the dollar.

>Why it matters: The dive shows that the steadily increasing sanctions from the U.S., the European Union and the United Kingdom will inflict massive pain on Russia's economy — the 11th largest on earth — and its people, in a shock that could reverberate throughout the global financial system.

>The Bank of Russia, the country's central bank, announced a raft of measures on Monday in an effort to alleviate the fallout.

>Details: Shortly before midnight in New York the ruble was down by more than 25% against the dollar, according to data from FactSet.

>Since the start of the year the currency has fallen more than 40%. 

>How it works: A blow like this to a country's currency sits somewhere on the line between economic and psychological warfare.

>It threatens to vaporize much of the ruble-based savings sitting in Russia's banks.

>It will send rates of inflation — already high in Russia — sharply higher.

>It drives people to withdraw their cash en masse and quickly try to convert it to more stable currencies, such as the dollar, the euro, gold or even crypto currencies. (Runs on ATMs were already starting to happen in Russia over the weekend.)

>It sends interest rates skyward, as global investors pull back in horror at the idea of lending to banks or countries that use a currency that could become worthless.

>High interest rates slam the brakes on the economy, throwing people out of work just as prices soar, a miserable combination of conditions known as stagflation.

Some excerpts:

&#x200B;

Q: The EU, the US and Canada announced the freezing of the reserves of the Central Bank. It seems that this scared everyone more than the disconnection from SWIFT. How hard will it hit us?

A:  This is very important news, absolutely unexpected, no one knew that this was possible. The presence of reserves has been one of the key pillars of macroeconomic stability - what will happen tomorrow in the foreign exchange market is difficult to predict. Just because it never happened.We are entering a situation in which it is difficult to predict how the ruble will behave. Maybe tomorrow there will be no auction. Maybe there will be panic. But this is a huge blow to the ruble. This can be said with absolute certainty.

&#x200B;

Q: Does it depend on the country in which the Central Bank reserves are actually stored now?

A: Yes, it does. Now some say: it's okay, the Central Bank still has gold and yuan, they can definitely be sold. It's also a non-obvious moment. Because American sanctions are a very serious mechanism, and Chinese banks will not necessarily want to help the Russian Central Bank, because America can impose serious punishment on them for this. It's happened before, it's not a theory.

For example, with the French bank BNP Paribas, which violated US sanctions and was forced to pay a multi-billion dollar fine. I can't imagine that Chinese banks would be willing to help Russia at that cost.The situation is completely unclear. Will it be possible to sell gold tens, as \[Mikhail\] Bulgakov would say? It is not entirely clear who would want to buy this gold \[from the Central Bank's reserves\] at the risk of falling under US sanctions.

America may prohibit Chinese banks from buying Russian gold and exchanging the yuan that the Central Bank has for dollars. And the Russian Central Bank, of course, needs dollars and euros, because most of the imports of the Russian economy are still Europe. To buy pills, technology, food, you need dollars, not yuan.

Whether Chinese banks can help Russia cope with the shortage of dollars or euros is completely unclear. I wouldn't bet on it. I think that, most likely, Chinese banks will say: “Sorry, we are great friends and we think that you are great fellows, but because of American sanctions we will not be able to cooperate with you.

&#x200B;

Q: Are there any examples of such sanctions working?

A:- It works, of course. I will give you an example of Iran. Iran wanted to build its own nuclear bomb, sanctions were imposed, Iran went to negotiations and made a deal  - negotiations. And until the arrival of Donald Trump, this deal was supported.

Most likely, such harsh sanctions will lead to the fact that Vladimir Putin will have to start negotiations on the withdrawal of troops from Ukraine. And the discontent of the citizens will push him to this. I would not put my money on the fact that tomorrow grateful citizens will come out with posters: “Thank you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, for the ruble is much cheaper than last week. We support the war against the brotherly people.""

There will be no such rallies tomorrow. Sooner or later he will have to negotiate.",False,1646034837.0,t3_t39hx1,t3_t39hx1,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

What's interesting to me is that considering Purim's military background, I really would not have thought he'd be the one to fumble an invasion that (on paper) he should have much less trouble with.

> The ministry said on Monday:

> The bulk of [President Vladimir] Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict.

> Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continue to frustrate the Russian advance.”

> Heavy fighting continues around Chernihiv, a city in northern Ukraine, and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, the defence ministry said in an intelligence update posted on Twitter. Both cities remain under Ukrainian control, it said.

First and foremost you need to realize they're taking an antiwar angle. They compare it to bombings in Yemen, or Somalia, and frame the US as an aggressor. This is angle to appeal to leftists. It's basically ""US Bad!"" and many prominent left wing streamers have run with this info. 

The other appeals to the right wing. It involves identical social issues that exist in the us. Critical Race Theory. Trans  bathroom laws. Pronoun usage. Kids being trans (there's a lot of trans stuff) and of course everyone's favorite conservative ""attack"" strategy, which is an attempt to undermine family unity through university instructors who are pushing these ideas. Americanisation of a country means accepting these ideas. They're against them because they're seen as American. 

In these instances you have to bring someone on the left or right back to the matter at hand. Which is Ukraine. No matter if they start talking about Yemen  or Trans people, just bring it back to Ukraine, and what's happening there. You can't win a debate with either side on these topics. It's like arguing a flat earther. 

Then, they're focusing on Russians within Donetsk, and their conditions after the ""coup"" in 2014. It focuses on personal stories. Propagandists will often speak about a ""grandma"" or friend and fabricate stories about their tribulations trying to be Russian in Ukraine. These are necessitated upon the belief that Russians are a persecuted minority just trying to live their lives. They've been there for generations  and just wish to live in peace. They then make a parallel between the revolution in 2014, and its most extreme elements to ordinary politicians. This is easier than most believe. In the US for instance,ANTIFA becomes equated with Biden. In Russia, Nazis are associated with Zelensky. All of the public propaganda coming out in Russian, is reliant on this idea that Russians are being persecuted. 

This is why bots and trolls also spread Russophobic statements and beliefs. They create strawman to knock down. This is why it's important to not give in to hate for Russian people.

-	Putin completely misreading how quickly the world and the West in particular will unite against him  
-	Ukraines territory being a lot harder to control without air superiority and complete denial of Ukrainian logistics. The second part isn't possible because of constant supplies coming in from the EU through friendly borders   
-	The reluctance or fear on part of the Russians to do to Ukraine what they did in Syria and Chechenya and parts of Georgia (completely flatten and monstrously destroy urban environments)  
-	Ukraine not going broke. Wars are expansive and expensive, and the euros and dollars flowing in from the West are keeping Ukraine afloat   


Even though the war is most certainly going to be long and protracted, it's going to be fundamentally more damaging to Russia than it is going to be to Ukraine.  
   
The only way Putin is going to avoid those sanctions and the financial damage is if he backs off from Ukraine which will win him sanctions relief.

Bomb shelters are being prepped by local authorities and the state. People are taking sick days and vacation days to spend time at home. There is little activity in thr streets. A sense of fear from almost everyone. It's sobering inna scary way and shows you how fragile we truly are. 

But there is also great unity. Political fighting is incredibly low, pretty squabbles about pretty much everything has stopped almost completely. Media is showing more unity as well. People, even those that have been against such things before, are talking openly about how we much do better moving forward. Be it renewable energy, refugees, togetherness or anything like that. People want to move forward and make a better world than we had 3 weeks ago, and a better future than what was projected 3 weeks ago. Everyone are talking about the world, no matter where you are, being our brothers and sisters, and it is absolutely beautiful. 

These are scary times, and it is beyond insane that one man has the power and potential to end us all and the world we inhabit. But these are also hopeful times for what is to come. Once this is over and the we, the world, have won against this madman and neutralized his mad threats, I have no doubt that unity and hope will be two things at an all time high. Because qho thr fuck cares about petty shit when all of humanity has been forced to stare death in the eye every second of every day for weeks?

The U.S. led coalition had air superiority in Iraq in less than 3 hours during Desert Storm. Major resistance was over within 24 hours and all sanctioned combat had ceased within 100 hours. Iraq had the 4th largest army in the world at the time and many experts were afraid the coalition would face a long, brutal war with Iraq. Ukraine wasn't even close to that revered before this invasion and they are still holding off the Russians and the Russians still haven't been able to get full air superiority. Granted, the west gave the Ukraine a lot of weapons, but its not like the Stinger or Javelin missile systems are anything new. Those were around decades ago.

Russia screwed themselves with this invasion. The west was afraid of them weeks ago, not just because of the nuclear arsenal, but because of their conventional military as well. Now that conventional military has proven to be a machine rusted away to the core, covered in fresh paint, and called ""good as new"" by their government. The only card they have that scares the world now is the nuclear option, which isn't as impressive as you'd think on the surface. Russia is a regional power at best, much like Pakistan with their nukes. Granted, Russia has a lot more of them, but nukes really aren't that big of a deal these day. Mutually assured destruction virtually guarantees they wont be used. Russia needs to sit down and realized the world has moved on from their sphere of influence now. Its over for them.

I have spent some time in Russia and there I have met some of the loveliest, nicest people I know.

They know what happens to protesters and they are scared that their families might be hurt in retaliation for their protests. We must remember, Putin's anti-opposition-forces are separate from the army, are fully staffed and equipped and ready to carry out Putin's orders - as we have already seen.

I feel for the ordinary people in Russia, because I know that no-one can help them but themselves and they will suffer when they do.

>“Belarus has always tried to chart this middle course, going to the EU, going to Russia. But Lukashenko lost,” said William Alberque, a former Nato official who is now director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Putin said ‘pay up’. And he did.”

>For central and eastern Europe, Lukashenko’s change in stance brings risks. One of the most immediate is a shift in the balance of power around the Suwalki gap, the 65km-long stretch of land that makes up the Polish-Lithuanian border and links the Baltic states to the rest of the EU.

>Bordered to the west by the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, and to the east by Belarus, the strip of land has long been seen as one of Nato’s weak points. If the 30,000 Russian troops that have poured into Belarus since earlier this year remain, Moscow’s ability to cut off the Baltic states from the rest of the EU will be greatly enhanced.

Do the ATMs only dole out Rubles (likely but I really have no idea)? Or if there wasn't a run could Euros be withdrawn assuming they are in in my account?

If I can't get Euros from the ATM if a walk into a Russian bank this morning will they allow me to withdrawl all my Euros in hard currency?

Russian centeral bank can always print more rubles (ignoring inflation effects). But if I had say 2000 Euro on deposit I'd want them now before the bank only lets me access some percentage of even forces them to be converted to rubles before I can withdraw them.

Anyone have actual insite, as opposed to speculation?

Why? Because of what Bloomberg notes is growing speculation that China's CIPS could become an alternative for those banks.

What is CIPS? It is a payment system which offers clearing and settlement services for its participants in cross-border yuan trades. Indeed, it is a Chinese version of SWIFT, and one which most Russian banks will likely soon be forced to adopt.

It is now clear that instead of driving a wedge between Russia and the country that is actually the biggest US challenger on the global scene, China, the West has succeeded into bringing the two powers even closer together while putting the fate of the world's reserve currency in jeopardy.

*thinking out loud/looking for arguments against my thoughts*

I to have been wondering why the attack is not going well. No doubt any homeland country is going to fight tough,  but even an arm chair general knows Russia has every military advantage. Including strategies. I know an easy answer is they want to minimize infrastructure damage, sure but something is not adding up.
Then I thought of myself; I've been scrolling and reading every live update I can get my eyes on. I want Ukraine to repeal the attack and am rooting for them like my local sports team of favorite F1 driver. All of sudden I thought maybe putin/Kremlin want this.

A fixed currency exchange rate can increase confidence/create stability, however it requires the state to sell at that fixed rate, and they must do so with their own reserves, once those reserves are gone, the government has no choice but to float its currency on the market again.

USD is the global reserve currency, though China and Russia have been trying to change that, and the Euro has also occupied a position in most countries portfolios now.

The Russian gov't is essentially saying, they will give you money from their reserves in exchange for rubles at that rate. Everyone is going to take them up on that rate and soon enough they won't have any USD/Euros left. Normally this is a problem because they wouldn't be able to conduct international trade, but they're sanctioned anyways so they might not care as much.

Essentially, it's unsustainable and the gov't is going to end up holding the cheque (and the Russian companies they're also forcing to hold rubles).

The key is also that nobody is interested in buying ruble's for that price (especially if they don't expect the 1:100 to last), and lots of the bank's assets are frozen, so they have limited ways of getting more dollars to finance this rate.

But still, technically it all depends on how many ruble's are exchanged for dollars and euros in the coming days. Based on what's going on though I have to assume there's going to be massive demand, which means this will be very expensive and potentially just fail completely if they run out.

So floors and ceilings for exchange rates are the 2 limits that can be applied to currencies to control inflation/deflation. For simple math' sake let's say the Ruble starts out at 1 Ruble/50 US cents. Russia decides to set a currency band with limits of 25 cents<= 1 ruble <= 75 cents. this means that they allow the Ruble to float on market value between those 2 ranges. Let's say the Ruble starts falling dramatically, however, due to, say, starting a hypothetical armed conflict with a sovereign, peaceful neighbor and the subsequent economic sanctions. Once the Ruble hits that Floor band of 25 cents/Ruble, it then ceases to be exchanged at market for the going rate, and cannot be traded lower. This is a pretty strait forward way to stop hyper inflation/stagflation; however, you run the major risk of banks starting to refuse to trade in your (in this example) Ruble due to the losses they're taking in the exchange. If it were to raise dramatically in value ABOVE the ceiling, you run into the opposite issue where everyone stops wanting to trade the Ruble for international currency. This can become an issue in the longer run, as presuming your currency's rise was pretty sudden, your people are going to leave a lot of money on the table when the market crashes back down to normalcy. On top of that, you run the added risk of not realizing all of the value you could have if the currency's actual value stayed above the ceiling for a long period of time (at least not until you raise the ceiling).",1646035556.0,1646034512.0,t3_t39hx1,t1_hyr3dog,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes. It means they have to burn through their foreign and currency reserves to support the rate.

Banks need to stay solvent, there’s a minimum % of deposits they need to have at close (this is called “fractional reserve banking”). Sometimes they’ll make a big loan or have a number of withdrawals and won’t have enough to meet their minimum. 

When that happens, they get an *interbank loan*. These are loans from one bank to another, usually for less than a week, generally overnight. 

The rate in question is the interbank rate. 20% encourages banks to lend to one another, which helps them stay above water during bank runs. 

It also makes it expensive for banks to borrow money, which means they will lend out less. This means less money goes into the system, which puts downward pressure on inflation. Consumers will in turn want to borrow less, because the rates are so high.

Im sure it's had updates, but the system then was connected to sensors that send a launch command when they detect the signal of a nuclear detonation within Russian territory. That signal comes via a combination of seismic waves and other readings. 

The commands are sent automatically in order to prevent a quick strike that knocks out comms. Each strategic nuclear ICBM gets a launch order when the trigger is set off. 

That dead-man's switch gets turned on when the nuclear deterrence system is set to high alert / readiness. It's very, truly dangerous since an earthquake, faulty sensor, whatever, could trigger it. 

The commands can be manually interrupted so it's not like an earthquake in the wrong region of russia is gonna kill us all, but the chances of a dual failure of a sensor and then the system to cancel the launch command isn't impossible.

Banks also have to lend money overnight to each other. The government will charge this rate (interbank rate, or “overnight rate”) to the borrower, and pass it on to the lender. That encourages banks to lend money interbank, which helps keep banks solvent. This stops the panic and bank runs.

Banks paying a higher rate to borrow money means they’re less likely to lend it, which means higher rates paid by the consumers and reduces loan applications. This prevents more money from leaking into the system.

The ability to lend at higher rates also soaks up some consumer money.

* Annex parts of Ukraine with natural gas (i.e. south coast and eastern Ukraine)
* Install puppet regime in order to turn Ukraine.in a buffer state (Putin still views the world as the Cold War era basically, with NATO having plans to invade Russia for some reason)

So if those are his goals, I suspect his demands are simply as follows:

* Current government needs to step down, followed by new elections (which he'll no doubt corrupt)
* Expand Crimea to the southern coast, so that all natural gas deposits in the sea there belong to Russia
* Acknowledge the ""independence"" of eastern Ukraine (puppet regimes)
* Demand Ukraine remains neutral forever; they can never join NATO


If he wants to be really transparent, he'll even demand NATO itself will no longer expand (no new members ever) and that they will pull back their troops to west Germany (seems familiar?). Yes, this would be an insane demand, but I wouldn't put it past him.

In other words: Putin basically wants to go back to the old status quo of Soviet Russia, where he only has to worry about defending from Germany.

Meanwhile, Ukraine will probably demand the following (rightly so):

* Demand Russia hand over Crimea to its rightful owner, Ukraine
* Demand Russia withdraw any support for the eastern ""republics"" inside Ukraine
* Demand Russia withdraw from Ukraine
* Demand freedom to pursue NATO and EU membership if they wish


Maybe, just maybe, Ukraine will accept not pursueing NATO membership, but given Russia's actions, that would be a hard sell. After all, Putin just proved they can't trust him and that he only fears NATO. Becoming a member would essentially guarantee safety for Ukraine. Ukraine may also leave the Crimea issue alone for now, betting on them revolting Russia's occupation and rejoining Ukraine, or planning to take it back at a later date (esp. given how Russia just proved to be incompetent). It was an unlawful annexation of their land after all, so they'd probably not suffer any sanctions from the western world if they did. They just need to wait for tensions with Russia to settle down.


If you're still paying attention, that means I don't see a chance in hell of these peace talks bearing any fruit. The only question is how blatantly obvious Russia will be in their demands/plans. They will never agree to surrender Crimea and I don't see them backing down from the 2 eastern ""republics"" either, at least of which will be a non-negotiable term for Ukraine.

First, he'd have to actually get other people to go along with using nuclear arms.

Let's say they have no family or friends and don't care about their country, to be that high up in the system you know that your identity is known to every intelligence service in the world. So even after you've helped reduced your homeland to glass, where, exactly, do you plan to go, and how are you planning on getting there? 

But let's say he did get through all those people. Let's say he's managed to beat every conceivable odd and somehow lucked out and only managed to surround himself with complete sociopaths who frankly don't care about any of that. Let's say he could very well get people to launch the nukes. 

Being that this has been a threat since the 50s, that means that since the 50s there have been people finding ways to nullify the threat of a nuke.

A war with China would be devastating, but assuming we've got nukes taken off the table, all that's left is naval, air, and land. 

America has the world's most up-to-date and dangerous navy, and support of all of Europe.

America absolutely wipes the floor in terms of air capabilities with nearly 4.5x the available aircraft that China has. Not including the majority being more modern.

We've got the most technically advanced and highly trained military in the entire world when talking boots on the ground. Smaller in numbers than China, but a single marine is trained and armed well enough to be equivalent to nearly 3-4 Chinese regulars.

We're not even taking into account special forces, military contractors, and the rest of the free world who would be fighting alongside us.

China, Russia, and India have manpower, nukes, and money. It's all they have and money goes quickly, nukes can be disabled, and better trained troops and a fuck ton more of advanced equipment can make short work of large groups.

They would need to print **a lot** of money and then straight up give it to the banks. I don't see that happening. The issue with a bank run is that in general banks actually have way less money than is available on people's banking account. Not just physically in the form of bank notes. But also in the form of liquid assets. Generally, for every dollar you have in your banking account, the bank only actually has 10 cents. When you retrieve money from the ATM, the bank is basically just borrowing that money from someone's else checking account.

And that works fine honestly. As long as nobody is retrieving that money at the same time, because the bank doesn't have that money. Not physically, and not digitally either and there's no checking accounts to ""borrow"" it from if every checking account is being withdrawn at the same time. That's the issue with a bank run. The common ""solution"" is to simply block all ATM's in the country until the panic settles, but there's no real solution for that either. Another solution, which Greece seriously considered, is writing out IOU-checks to people that can be used as an alternative currency. But that would be a real crisis-time solution, and the question is how that will impact Putins popularity, I don't know how that squares with their propaganda. And of course they could just print their way out of a bank run. But again, that would be really a lot of money. So much that inflation effects really cannot be ignored.

About Russian ATM's. I've never been to Russia so I don't know. But I've traveled to a lot of places around the world, and it's very rare to have ATM's with multiple currencies.

Putin has isolated himself for the last 2 years because he is seriously paranoid about COVID-19 most of the time. Him keeping people at a distance has been a thing for quite some time now.

Also Navalny or Prokhorov is completely unrealistic. We would be very lucky if Putin gets offed. I give it less than a 1% chance right now. But if it happens, it will be one of his oligarch friends stepping in.

I also disagree about peace talks. There simply is no common ground to be found. Putin is negotiating with the Ukrainian government when his officially stated goal #1 for this conflict is to get rid and kill those guys. There also is no realistic compromise. Putin needs a win he can show at home and Zelensky can never agree to cede territory to the Russians due to an invasion and they have already stated so. I am 99 % sure that these negotiations are going nowhere and both sides have known this from the start.

So they will simply stop exchanging money, knowing they could probably do better the next day.

These tools involve money supply, expectation setting and currency reserve/swaps.

When problems are happening internally, by people losing confidence in their currency they usually end up wanting to hoard or exchange it themselves, think people buying gold when theyre afraid or something. This is likely to cause bank runs and massive spiral of inflation with the central bank tools partly frozen (announcements that russias CB is blocked from accessing FX reserves in several countries).

If a CB comments on a situation it’s usually to signal minor things like if it’s dovish or bearish or what it thinks rates will move to. If it tries to set expectation by “urging calm” it’s trying to prevent a banking failure/currency crisis (think Zimbabwe hyperinflation).

EDIT: to add to this, as mentioned in this thread the 2 things that Russias CB has done so far is raise interest rates from 9 to 20% (which incentivizes foreign investment and people to keep their money in the bank), and are trying to peg currencies. 
The first is a bit more obvious in terms of effects and it’s been explained in the threads. The second only works if you have currency reserves to create the pegs (which according to some sources Russia has been blocked from about half of their reserves). This means to keep the peg the CB needs to take the loss on the market values by printing money to compensate for the difference and push the rate to where it wants it to be. This is counterintuitive and is only a short term remedy with little enforceability (due to the size of the Russian economy vs the others) as this creates inflation over time.  The details of this process are a bit more complicated but that should be sufficient.

This of course means that the CBs statements urging calm means that they think these measures are not sufficient to ensure stability and have resorted to strongly worded suggestions.",1646038545.0,1646033046.0,t3_t39hx1,t1_hyr1rdr,,2,27,0,27,0,0,

They are living under the thumb of a lunatic. A KGB *clerk* who felt wronged by his superiors, who felt he was never given his due, whose brilliance wasn't properly appreciated. He wanted to be James Bond, he was actually Moneypenny, and he *hated* it. He spent his entire life since then trying to prove how much better he was than those superiors who had seen him for what he was, a dangerously unbalanced little troll with grandiose visions of himself. A man whose loyalty was not to Russia but to himself.

The world around him exists to appease his ego. If this costs the Russian people their children, their brothers, their fathers, it literally makes no difference to him.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

“When NATO announced in 2002 its plan for a major wave of expansion that would include three former Soviet republics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania—Putin barely reacted. He certainly did not threaten to invade any of the countries to keep them out of NATO. Asked specifically in late 2001 whether he opposed the Baltic states’ membership in NATO, he stated, “We of course are not in a position to tell people what to do. We cannot forbid people to make certain choices if they want to increase the security of their nations in a particular way.”

People are bum rushing the banks and atms to pull out their rubles, however there are a couple problems with that. There's a finite amount of printed money and the banks don't have enough on hand to give everyone what they had in their accounts. Banks use your deposits as security to buy and sell loans and such, so they never have the amount of actual cash available as what people have put in. In the US, FDIC guarantees you will get every penny you put in a bank back upon demand. Russia doesn't have that. Hyper inflation means that paper currency is so worthless that goods and services are more valuable, so the economy shifts to a barter system rather than using cash. Countries, especially Russia, are dishonest about how much gold they have to back their currency so people can't even count on using gold as currency. 

A loan 3 days ago at 5-7% interest is now 20% interest or more. This decreases buying power for everyone, consumers and businesses alike. 

Finally, SWIFT is an international way of moving money from institution to institution. Now that the money can't move, the economy goes into free fall. Trading is suspended in a vain attempt to stabilize this free fall and keep the ruble from declining further. Exchange rates for foreign currency depend on the stock market, which is why when you travel it's wise to exchange your money before you leave. Oftentimes the exchange rate in a particular country fluctuates throughout the day. Right now, nobody can trade in rubles, but that doesn't change the fact that for citizens, every single thing now costs 40% more today than yesterday.",False,1646035068.0,t3_t39hx1,t1_hyr3k56,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

I do want to address the tank comment though. Tanks are still relevant for occupying urban centers. I know, I marched along them through middle eastern streets a decade ago. The issue is the way you use them. Russia is fighting this like its WW2, and those tank tactics are worthless on the modern battle field. Tanks are effective when you have full air superiority and advance infantry using them as cover. They are not effective as the brute force of your army. You also need tanks that can hold up to enemy fire. Russia's can't because their enemy's weapons are more advanced than the tank's defenses. My unit's tanks had all sorts of reactive armor and special cages around them to cause anti tank rockets to fail at penetrating the armor. The real key in being able to use the tanks though is the infantry around them.

Now, I haven't lived under a dictatorship, I was born two months after my country regained independence from the Soviet Union. But my parents have. My grandparents have.

You have a sharp divide between the young and more outward looking (usually the higher educated ones) and the rest of the populace.

I don't think you can trust these polls but all these reports about someone knowing Russians that are anti-Putin are simply not representative.

The average Russian is older (they have a huge demographic problem) ,doesn't speak English, gets his information from Putins propaganda network and is probably too old to know how to properly use the Internet. These people are most certainly behind Putin. But you also don't get to meet these people as a Westerner. You get to maybe meet their kids and the younger people (say younger than 35) are overwhelmingly against Putin or atleast indifferent I would say but their parents think very differently.

Banks also have to lend money overnight to each other. The government will charge this rate (interbank rate, or “overnight rate”) to the borrower, and pass it on to the lender. That encourages banks to lend money interbank, which helps keep banks solvent. This stops the panic and bank runs.

Banks paying a higher rate to borrow money means they’re less likely to lend it, which means higher rates paid by the consumers and reduces loan applications. This prevents more money from leaking into the system.

This was the case in the US up until 1971 when Nixon put a “temporary” pause on the ability to redeem USD for gold. That pause became permanent. The reason for this is that the US started printing more USD than was backed by gold. Eventually there was far too much USD to reasonably fulfill redemptions of USD for gold.

Global, government-backed currencies will likely never be backed by a commodity ever again. For existing currencies it would be impossible to reimplement a gold standard. Fiat is typically distributed as loans, usually cheaper than would otherwise be the market rate, and over time cheap loans tend to create bad debt, and one of the only reliable ways to pay off bad debt is with even cheaper loans. This is what is called the debt cycle of fiat money. Pulling out of this cycle by imposing a gold standard would make it nearly impossible for the federal government, many large banks, institutions, and individuals, to pay off their current debt.

All that said. This is why the Ruble is such a mess right now. It is subject to the economic conditions of Russia. If it were backed by something then the citizens of Russia would have much safer financial conditions for themselves.

Citizens of all countries are subject to similar risks with their currency, not to mention the endless cycle of debasement I mentioned earlier, as well as seizure from governments.

6bc7c8770296af9b0b0e06a5dac77b78,t39hx1,hyr9rdt,">Why not?

Why not *what*?  I'll address the two possible things I *think* you might be asking but correct me if I'm wrong.

If your question was ""Why is it not easy to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate traffic,"" this would be my fairly simplified answer:

Legitimate traffic, such as *you* visiting one of these sites will always look like legitimate traffic.  Depending on the goals and capabilities of an attacker it very well may look like legitimate traffic as well but often times it doesn't.  A DNS reflection/amplification attack for example would be a bunch of DNS responses sent to a server that is intended to handle web traffic - very easy to differentiate.  The problem with such attacks, and others that do not look like legitimate traffic, is that the traffic flows overwhelm the connectivity of the network and it has to be filtered before it ever reaches the network otherwise the filtration does no good.

A botnet of thousands of systems trying to load a page with the goal of taking it offline *looks like legitimate traffic* because technically it is - just not on a legitimate scale or for legitimate reasons.

The most effective attacks are ones that mimic legitimate users because you can't just cut off the attack without cutting off legitimate users.

If your question was ""Why not sending something back to every one that visits?""

The answer to that is simple - there are surely legitimate users that really do want to access and use those sites.  From government officials, Russian politicians, to the Russian people and citizens themselves.  It would simply not make sense for Russia to intentionally cause damage to anyone that tried to visit their sites because there is no real good way to make sure it doesn't impact their own people.

Beyond that - if they could send something back \[i.e. if the attack wasn't actually working\] - what they would send back would be their website.  The very nature of a DDoS attack is to prevent the server(s) that is/are responsible for serving the site(s) from doing so.

>I don't think we're going to end up on the same page here (pun intended).

I believe you there - and that's why I've left the door wide open to you not visiting any of these sites and continuing down the path you've chosen.

>But what I'll end with is this: Most people know next to nothing about these things.

Believe me, I know.  It's often a struggle to even tell people what I do for employment much less explaining the intricacies of how it all works.

>If it were me who had significant experience in this area, I would be the first to dissuade complete amateurs from participating in something where they have no clue what they're doing,

I would *absolutely* dissuade you from trying to attack *any* site Russian *or not*.  That said - trying to legitimately load a website because you legitimately want to see the contents of that site *is not an attack*.  I would not dissuade you from trying to load a site because that site was down or under attack as it simply makes no technical sense to do so.

*I absolutely would* dissuade you from holding down the reload key, trying to load the site on multiple systems simultaneously, etc - but that doesn't just go for this.  It goes for any website anywhere at any time.

>there's no way to verify if the people telling them to do it are legitimate, and which might actually be illegal. I certainly wouldn't be advocating it.

I've not advocated that you do anything - I've simply tried to explain to you that your fear of just *trying to load a page while it's under a cyber-attack \[DDoS\]* isn't rational from the standpoint of how all of this works.  ***Again I'll say that if you don't want to visit the sites because you feel it puts you at risk - don't visit them.***

Clicking the link because you want to see the site isn't an issue at all.  Actually trying to load those links tens, hundreds, or thousands of times with the sole intention of disrupting the service is.

That said my biggest point about that is that there is no real way for the operators of those websites to know whether you were a legitimate user trying to visit the site or an attacker - short of looking at how many requests you've made compared to others / the average and how fast you made those requests.

At no point did I suggest that you should try repeatedly - but simply tried to let you know that just trying to see the sites for yourself [i.e. casually loading them] was just fine.

Being that the services _are offline_ due to attacks - you would show up exactly 0 times in their logs.  They can't log your connection _if you cannot connect_.  Even if you _did_ manage to connect once - that's one connection out of millions or billions that are being attempted _every second_.
