Day 267 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with missile strikes yet again, but this one was nowhere near as big as the one from 2 days ago. Some missiles were launched from Belgorod in the direction of Kharkiv, but maybe not at the city. Though we can’t be certain of that, as today a good amount of them was actually intercepted over Kharkiv oblast, so we don’t know where the intercepted missiles were headed. Some of the missiles that weren’t intercepted landed somewhere around Izyum, maybe also Kupiansk.

It also looks like all of the missiles headed for Kyiv were intercepted, which is great, our air defense is getting noticeably stronger, even if it’s still not enough. By the time we can intercept the entire missile strike of around 100 missiles all heading for our cities at the same time, our air defense will probably be one of the strongest in the world, and something like a Russian bomber will never be able to fly in our airspace ever again. 

Sadly some missiles still make it through our air defense, enough of them that our energy grid takes heavy damage with each new missile strike. Apparently about 40% of our country is with no stable electricity right now, and we need a lot of foreign help to keep repairing the damage that is being done. 

Russians are openly saying that they are attacking our energy infrastructure to make us negotiate with them, but that will never happen, we are fine with living in the darkness as long as Russia is defeated. People who are saying that we should just give up are fucking mad. They are probably the same people that would have surrendered to Nazi Germany if they had the chance, because “you can’t win anyway, and all it would do is change your government, why do you care?” People that don’t care about who is at the helm of their country are unimaginably stupid, being “apolitical” is a terminal disease, which led to this war in the first place.

On November 15, Russia launched its largest missile strike since the beginning of the war, firing around 70 Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles, 20 anti-ship Kalibrs, and 10 kamikaze drones. Although the effectiveness of air defense is already quite high (73 of 90 missiles), the Kremlin is still serious about achieving its goal — depriving the country of electricity and bringing it to a humanitarian disaster.

According to the estimates of the Ukrainian MoD, today Russia possesses only 13% of the pre-war stocks of Iskanders, although it still has about 43% of sea-launched Kalibrs and 45% of Kh-101/Kh-555 aircraft missiles. Ukraine’s situation could become much more difficult if Russia is able to get its hands on Iranian ballistic missiles. Western countries are providing Kyiv with as much assistance as they can, but a realistic way to close the sky over Ukraine is to ensure direct involvement of NATO in the conflict.

“It is an extremely difficult situation, and it is not a surprise to anyone that there are emotions here. He is going through everything that his nation is going through. It is his nation, that chose him for this post and for which he feels responsible,” Duda told journalists on Thursday during a visit at the site of the blast in Przewodow.
Duda said that all three parties – Poland, Ukraine and the US – are collecting information on their end, reinstating that what happened on Tuesday was a “tragic” accident.

“Nobody wanted to hurt anyone in Poland,” Duda said, adding that “so far, we haven't found any traces of the second missile on Polish territory.”

Two farmers died Tuesday when a missile landed outside the rural eastern Polish village of Przewodow, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) west of the Ukrainian border.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has insisted the missile was not Ukrainian, and said that Ukrainian experts must be allowed access to the site of the explosion and review all data available to its allies. 

When asked why Zelensky denies it was a Ukrainian missile, Severa replied: “President Zelensky represents a country that is at war. The war that had the hardest time in terms of attacks and the use of air assault.""

“That’s not the evidence,” Biden told reporters at the White House after returning from the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.
Two farmers died Tuesday when a missile landed outside the rural eastern Polish village of Przewodow, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) west from the Ukrainian border.

Polish officials have indicated that it is likely a Ukrainian missile, deployed by its air defenses amid waves of Russian missile attacks Tuesday, fell inside Polish territory.

Zelensky's comments: Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Zelensky said he did not believe the missile was Ukrainian.

""I have no doubt that it was not our missile,"" he said.
Later, in his daily video address, Zelensky said ""clarification of all the circumstances of how Russian aggression crossed the Polish border"" was now an issue before the UN Security Council. He said he had spoken with Polish President Andrzej Duda and expressed his condolences but insisted it was ""Russian aggression"" that had claimed the lives of two Polish citizens.

""The Ukrainian position is very transparent: we want to establish all the details, every fact. That is why we need our experts to join the work of the international investigation and to get access to all the data available to our partners and to the site of the explosion,"" Zelensky said. - CNN

50.450N, 30.523E Kyiv, Ukraine

49.830N, 24.031E Lviv, Ukraine

50.450N, 24.031E About 5 km outside Przewodów, Poland where the missile hit.

The Russians mixed together the latitude and longitude of two different targets.

That is way too much of a coincidence, it would be the coincidence of the century. It was a Russian missile, that's why Ukraine is so adamant it wasn't one of theirs.

Now the uncomfortable question: is NATO lying so they don't feel pressured to retaliate against Russia in some way or was their investigation so incompetent that they just got it wrong? Neither explanation is comforting.

Edit: Those coordinates in Kyiv are a large public square with a mall next to it. The one in Lviv is much smaller public  sqaure and I don't see anything of significance other than that, but also they're *both* public squares which are targets Russia has hit before. I am not one for wild conspiracy theories and I am not trying to take sides but just like... what are the odds of all this being a fluke? The only conclusion I can make is the Kyiv and Lviv targets were on a strike list somewhere and a Russian made a massive, huge fucking mistake.

Edit 2: To be clear look at the coordinates. I am saying when some Russian programed the missiles target they mixed together the latitude of the target in Kyiv and the longitude of the target in Lviv giving them the coordinates in Poland. Literally a data entry mistake and incompetence that it wasn't caught, not exactly crazy that they might have got sloppy given what we've seen of the Russian army so far.

Edit 3: So in response to some you can't just pick any city though, the impact in Poland is where it is, those numbers are fixed. The longtitude is the same in Poland and for Lviv. So you ccould scan down anywhere along 24.031E and find a target in Ukraine, what are the odds you cross a public square in a major city that Russia has hit before? You can't just pick any number, the strike in Poland is along the same north south longitude line. Then for latitude of the impact in Poland also happens to be the *exact same latitude as Kyiv?*

Straight east of the impact in Poland is that public square in Kyiv. Directly south is that square in Lviv. Maybe I am not seeing something but saying ""oh they just picked any city to make the numbers work"" does not seem to be true. If am missing something please point out the flaw in my logic, not just say ""you're wrong!""

Maybe it was just a Ukrainian anti aircraft missile gone awry but not one person has actually debunked the logic of this, they've just said it's wrong.",1668663534.0,1668659501.0,t3_yxfz4p,t3_yxfz4p,,0,-12,0,-12,0,0,

Kh-55s launched at the beginning of the war displayed abysmal performance when over half of them weren't even been able to get onto the flight path and didn't even reach Ukraine. Later on the launch points were moved, so the missiles could more clearly detect entry points. Still literally half of the cruise missiles were just thrown away. Most of the Kh-55 stock was then sent for modernization (hence we see only newer types). 10th of October had almost two hundred missiles in the air (two groups  of 16 Tu-95 bombers + 2 Tu-160, 3 frigates (8 Kalibrs each) and at least 2 Improved Kilo subs (4 Kalibr each). From the screenshot of UA airspace control radar it looked that just over 100 missiles were able to cross the Ukrainian border (typical loadout for those Tu-95s is 4 missiles each, Tu -160 - 6 to 12 each) which gives an estimate of 55 to 60% success rate. That's really really bad. 

My point is - if Russia will be able to fix those issues with cruise missiles - then it can be much worse for Ukraine. 10th of October was clear attempt to saturate their defenses.

I'm in favor of all of this.

You can't have a nuclear-armed terrorist state bombing civilians and civilian infrastructure on purpose to try to bully the entire rest of the world into getting its way. That crosses a bright red line into terrorism and evil. And if we let that go unpunished that green lights an age of nuclear-armed imperial terrorism across the world that states like Russia and China will take advantage of over and over again. Subjugating and bombing the shit out of people who are powerless to fight back. It will tell the world nukes are literally the only way to protect yourself. It will tell the nuclear armed bad actors that now is a feeding frenzy, do what you like to those not already in the club. It will destabilize the world, upend the status quo, and cause a nuclear arms race across the globe. That pushes us ultimately closer to nuclear conflict in the long-run, not further away from it.

All we want to do is give the bullied every chance to punch the bully back. To get them to bleed and hurt badly enough that they have no choice but to back off. So, if Russia won't leave Ukraine their own, they need to get kicked out as mercilessly as possible.

No attacks in Russia. That's how we avoid escalation. This isn't an offensive move to conquer Russia. This is an offensive move to defensively kick out an invading army. After the job is done, let the Russians lob artillery from their own borders. They'll just bit hitting the supposed reservoirs of Russian-speaking, Russian-loving sympathizers who love Russia and supposedly voted 99.9% to join mother Russia. I'm sure that will strengthen Russia's case to these regions and greatly increase the love these people have for Russia. If Russia even has ammo and an economy left to even manage that over the next several months. They can burn out their missile stockpiles to the ground on a pointless effort that will make a larger war with Russia even less likely in the future anyway (as they will be increasingly unable to conquer any particular country, let alone NATO).",1668680021.0,1668679812.0,t3_yxfz4p,t1_iwp77ym,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

,yxfz4p,iwt0ed6,"These wars were incredibly humiliating and demoralizing for society, more so than Ukrainian conflict.   There was no build up of hostilities or brainwashing to prepare society for Afghan or Chechen war. 

Afghan war was supposed to be ""3 day"" show of force, not drawn out, dirty guerilla hunt in the mountains where Mujahideen would just vanish as ghosts - their most common nickname during the war. The fact that it was kept fully secret until vets with severe PTSD came back home to tell disturbing stories was total mindfuck for Soviets.  From their perspective, they had world's mightiest army, Afghanistan was an allied communist republic and there was 30 years of peace - Cold War was beginning to wind down and never became hot, thankfully. Soviet media and TV was anything but gritty and never highlighted worst that WW2 had to offer or would quickly glance over grizzly details. Don't think Soviet citizens were aware of invasions of Hungary and Chechoslovakia. Compared to what the vets were re-telling from Afghanistan, the most spine chilling Soviet movie was a Disney musical. You'll never hear a wholesome story like F117 pilot becoming friends with Serb who shot him down. 

There were a lot of amputees coming home from Afghanistan. Most lost legs to mines or had severe shrapnel wounds from explosives. A lot of these vets became beggars and in my city there was one guy without both legs completely gone and missing a whole wrist. He had no talents and I doubt could do anything in his condition, but he would spend the day on one of the markets and people would donate money to him no questions asked. The existence of people like him was a huge hit to collective Soviet pride in the 80ies - time of Moscow Olympic when police would arrest homeless people to keep streets ""clean"".

Chechen war happened back when Putin didn't destroy free media yet. It was heavily televised and Russian military was eating flak non stop. Several parties of Russian society openly opposed the war, while there were a lot of accusations of shady business going on, with rebels buying weapons from Russian army and looting cargo trains that somehow kept going to Chechen Republic and neighboring zones. You really need to see some good documentary about Chechen wars. Reddit comment can't sell you how much of a wild clusterfuck it was, and how deep it scarred Russian society.

But in terms of total losses, both wars were far less bloody. With invasion of Ukraine, we are talking losing 30 % of overall tank force and speculations that in only few months, the artillery shells and cruise missiles will run out. The fact that Russians have started cannibalizing Belarus and buying ordinance from Iran speaks for itself, as well as pulling troops from NATO border to support their *ahem* special operation.

 I think the full shock of their embarrassment didn't hit Russians in the face yet. There are some wake up calls with shitshow that was their partial mobilization, Kherson retreat and Kerch bridge explosion. But it always takes time for people to feel gravity of the situation, especially since Russia historically isn't the moat robust nation and lags behind Western world.",1668743537.0,1668740619.0,t3_yxfz4p,t1_iwsr26l,,1,32,0,32,0,0,

First is that it was a shotgun wedding, Musk never intended to buy it and was trolling. Market regulators didn't like him messing about and forced him to go through. Market regulators did this because they were sick of him skirting rules about speculating  buying this or that and his crypto manipulation through tweets.

Two is because he's just setting a policy, he's not really out to control Twitter or what people say. In the case of many massive media owners it's very easy to see them influence the political positions promoted on their newspaper or TV channel. He's not really out to do that and the people who do that with traditional media are not being pointed at for doing worse.

Third is that Elon Musk is just a weirdo asshole with too much reputation, which is why I and many others don't like him. Pointing at him for doing things on twitter mostly causes opinions to fall into the two camps that already exist on him, regardless of twitter itself and what his policy on twitter means for rich people influencing politics.

The S-300 has a much further range in ground attack mode, where it follows a quasi-ballistic trajectory after lofting up to that high altitude.  You will often find a ground-attack range of 75 miles being quoted, but that is also wrong. The 75 mile range is limited by guidance, not propulsion.  Beyond 75 miles the missile can no longer receive guidance updates from the launching ground station, but it can achieve a further range by switching to internal inertial navigation, at the cost of accuracy.  It is also reported, but not confirmed, that Russia has integrated GPS guidance onto some of these S-300 missiles in order to eliminate that guidance limit.

Ultimately it is impossible to nail down the exact range of ground-attack S-300s, particularly with the alleged modifications that have been made even during this war.

 >Flag-jacking (French: prise de drapeau) is the act of travelers wearing a foreign flag on their clothing or backpack in an attempt to disguise the country they are visiting from; this occurs most prominently in cases where American tourists wear Canadian flags in an attempt to pass as Canadians. The intention is that by showing the flag of a country regarded favorably by the region they are visiting, they will receive friendlier treatment or service than they might otherwise have encountered.

At this point he really desperately needs to make it look like the Russian Army isn't the complete clusterfick it's turned out to be. So he wants Poland to respond, he wants NATO to react somehow. That's how he gets some footage to parade all over Russia, saying ""See? We didn't lose Kherson because of Russian incompetence, it was the evil dastardly NATO/West/Nazi/Sith!"".

So it would make perfect sense if the missile was Russian, Poland is reluctant to respond forcefully and give Putin what he wants, and now they're deciding how to handle it. Naturally the pro Putin tankies want to make this out to being some wild conspiracy, when it's just Poland not wanting to take the bait.

Russia has nothing to gain by saying it was their rocket, whether or not it was, so I'm not even considering their denial. NATO has little if anything to gain by covering up the truth since, if they claimed it was fired by Russia, they would still have to vote on whether the missile strike warrants an Article 5 response and could simply agree to limited countermeasures, such as a NFZ extending a few miles around NATO/Ukraine borders.

https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-running-out-weapons-send-ukraine


HIMARS ammo
>The United States has an estimated inventory of about 25,000 to 30,000 remaining from a production run of 55,000 rockets to date. If the United States sent one-third of that inventory to Ukraine (as has been the case with Javelin and Stinger), Ukraine would receive 8,000 to 10,000 rockets. That inventory would likely last several months, but, when the inventory is exhausted, there are no alternatives. Production is about 5,000 a year. Although the United States is working to increase that amount, and money has recently been allocated for that purpose

>Javelin Missiles
Reportedly, the United States has given about one-third of its inventory to Ukraine, and reports have emerged that the military has raised concerns about having enough for other conflicts. Surprisingly, the August 19 arms package includes another 1,000 Javelins

>TOW Missiles
These guided anti-tank missiles (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided missiles, or TOW) have been in the U.S. inventory for decades and have been continuously upgraded over time. Launchers are heavier than Javelin and NLOS, so they are generally vehicle mounted, not carried by infantry. Because launchers and missiles are plentiful, large numbers can be provided to Ukraine. 

>155 mm Ammunition
because this is a NATO standard munition, a dozen countries can supply these projectiles. Therefore, transfers to Ukraine are unlikely to be constrained when the global market is considered.

>Although ***some*** U.S. stocks are running low, alternatives―older, experimental, or nonstandard systems―are available, and these will constitute an increasingly large proportion of transfers. The United States might also acquire some stocks from third countries.

It's much more likely that the huge delivery volume initially was to build up a stockpile in Ukraine, so Ukraine does not have to do just in time deliveries to the front lines.

There are many problems with this statement.

1. Russian propaganda doesn't need any proofs. You're out of touch if you ever consider it. If Russians are so gullible to believe in ""Ukrainian biolabs with mutated mosquitoes"" (I am not making this up), they will believe any shit without proofs, as there were no proof of biolabs and mutated mosquitoes.
