📢 This summary is supposed to be cross posted to the /r/worldnews live thread.  Because worldnews handles so much Reddit front-page traffic, the summary occasionally gets caught up in the automated rules meant to keep everyone civil and safe.  Please do not blame the mods when this happens, they do an amazing job keeping the live thread going and troll free.  If the summary fails to post, you can always get the report at my archive (link at bottom of the post).

🪖  Lots of fighting along the front-lines today and [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1560797590878359552), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560671579042119680.html),  and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560751327172595724.html) covered it all.  Guest analysis by “[Western Intelligence Official](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560592023383445504.html)”

🍄 When russian leadership was pulled out of Kherson, many were relocated to Melitopol and so were Ukrainian [target lists](https://twitter.com/Luba_luba__/status/1560754096491085825).

🍄 A really cool [infrared video](https://twitter.com/Lyla_lilas/status/1560746137056935937) of ammunition exploding in the forest in the Belgorod region of russia.

🍄🍿 So Friday has come and gone and there’s no radiological catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.  It appears the terroristic threats were just posturing to pressure Ukrainian President Zelensky into negotiations.  I’ve been careful to stress that shelling occurs in the plant *area* and not on the plant itself, and that was confirmed by [satellites today](https://twitter.com/Maxar/status/1560665913203904515) as pictures show the plant itself is undamaged.  putin talked to France’s President Macron and reportedly agreed to [IEAA inspections](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1560671582221062144) as early as September, and there are reports russia is [pulling its troops out of the plant area](https://twitter.com/NewVoiceUkraine/status/1560680494588575744) and is moving them to nearby cities.  russia also [came clean about hosting military equipment](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1560598323823722497) in the plant. 

🍄 A russian [military train was destroyed](https://twitter.com/WarAgainstPutin/status/1560659034667040768) in Donetsk.

🍿 In the Twitter rumor mill on Friday (read -- **unconfirmed**); While everyone is still running with the line that Pro-Ukrainian [saboteurs](https://twitter.com/jilevin/status/1560635461822971905) are behind the blasts at russian military sites, that may be true; however, since Thursday, Ukrainian drones have been harassing russian [air defense in Crimea](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1560704002911862786) in a [possible attempt to map russia’s air defense](https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1560711538822074370) and there are now, [credible](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560781165312745472.html), reports that Ukraine is sporting some [long-range](https://twitter.com/walter_report/status/1560748985580527617) HIMARS ammunition.  

👉 All of the action in Crimea is having a devastating [psychological impact](https://twitter.com/BBCWorld/status/1560695604103335937) on russia and some of russias [top bloggers](https://twitter.com/200_zoka/status/1560333524753960960) have almost turned into [Zelensky cheerleaders](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1560661702030413824). 

🛩 There was a [literal dogfight in the skies](https://twitter.com/mjluxmoore/status/1560325776477659143) over the Donbas on Friday, and that may become more common as apparently Ukraine pilots are being trained [on US A-10 Warthogs](https://twitter.com/wjhenn/status/1560681449895911437) which are being decommissioned by the US, for [very good reasons](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560632776713334785.html) according to some.

👉 In one of the previous summaries, it was reported that russia was spinning up a [disinformation campaign](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1557755059005440002) on Ukrainian President Zelensky.  On Friday we saw russia’s [first attempt](https://twitter.com/Seana_Davis/status/1560586961521242112).  As a side note, the smear campaign on the Finish Prime Minister having the audacity to attend a party and have a little fun is also [russian payback](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560575888780976128.html) for Finland joining NATO.

🛰️ In occupied Kherson, occupation authorities are handing out pamphlets on how to avoid the “[influence](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1560635877117685760)” of Ukraine’s new ICEYE satellite.

👉 The UN Secretary General António Guterres [arrived at the port](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1560606685768679424) of Odessa to observe ships being loaded for [the grain corridor](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1560642083043491840).  Mr. Guterres also warned russia [against cutting](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560598987601858561.html) the Nuclear Plant from the Ukraine electricity grid.

👉 It seems like at least one NASAMS 2 system is probably [already protecting Kyiv](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1560754729260556288) because the US has already shipped the ammunition, but the official systems are not expected for another [2-3 months](https://twitter.com/jseldin/status/1560659258479235073).
 
👉 Ukraine may be getting [much needed russian-style artillery](https://twitter.com/Ramandeep_Bajwa/status/1560034505599352832) ammunition from Pakistan.

👉 Kharkiv has [finished](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1560616315815018498) its first [bus stop bomb shelter](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1560621648688005121).  [Video](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1560568684594139138).

👉 Ukraine captured a russian drone that had a memory card with [a tour of the drone’s base](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1560675160247529472) on it.

👉 Polls are one thing, but the traffic jams out of Belgorod indicate russians on the street want nothing to do with [putin’s war](https://twitter.com/general_ben/status/1560734056664502274)

👉 russia is now holding [nightly ambushes](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1560733328495353856) to forcibly send Donbas men to war against Ukraine.

👉 At Friday’s army games in russia, we have an [out of control Sudanese tank](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560681529461850112.html).

👉 The Ukrainians rigged a [remote controlled machine gun](https://twitter.com/JulianRoepcke/status/1560658471866867712).

🇷🇴🇲🇩 In the event of russian aggression, neutral Moldova has announced it will [ask for help](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1560717214466064387) from Romania, a NATO member.  Not much is understood about the impact of this agreement at this time.

💰🇷🇺 russia found buyers for all the coal Europe stopped buying, but is having to sell at a very [steep discount](https://twitter.com/aujbadxm/status/1560234132025769984).

💰🇬🇷🇨🇾 Greece and Cyprus [oppose a ban on russian visas](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1560645328805564417) in the EU.
 
🔥 russia announced it will [stop pumping gas](https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1560672889812045826) to Europe through the Nord pipeline at the end of the month.  Currently russia is pumping at 20% capacity.

Day 178 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, but as usual they never skip a missile strike. This time they decided to do it very early, so they fired missiles at 12am, yesterday’s one was pretty early as well, at 1am. We don’t know how many missiles were launched, but people were saying that some missiles malfunctioned and blew up in the air again. I guess they are the same missiles from yesterday.

Some of the missiles landed in the city from what we can tell, but we don’t know what was hit yet. One of the missiles was very loud, it sounded like it exploded pretty close to us, within couple kilometers. Yesterday 2 missiles made it to the city and hit some infrastructure facility. Other missiles landed in Kharkiv oblast, Russian MOD said that they killed about “250 militants and 20 American mercenaries” with their “high-precision weapons,” those same weapons half of which self-destructed right after being fired.
 
Now they are also blaming us for attacking them with biological weapon, infecting their soldiers with botulism. I think they should be looking at their food first, because their rations are probably the biological weapons that they are looking for, but it’s easier to just blame us for it of course.

That assassination of Dugin’s daughter is pretty interesting, I wonder if it’s their own infighting, or if we are somehow involved in it. Anyway, it’s a shame that whoever did it, didn’t manage to get Dugin himself. He’s the fucker that wrote Foundations of Geopolitics, the same book which states Ukraine is not allowed to exist. He’s literally the Russian Goebbels, and in 2014 he was saying that they need to “kill, kill, kill” Ukrainians. His daughter was also very pro-war, saying that we are all Nazis here, so it’s not a complete miss, but it could have been better.

 > And then secondly, have there been any additional conversations or considerations about sending fighter jets to Ukraine? Thanks.

> SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Great. So on the HARMs, when we first announced the initial provision of HARM missiles, the way that we characterized it in the announcement was not specific. We described that we were providing a counter-radar capability.

> ...

> And then on your second question on fighters, this is something where we certainly are looking at the Ukrainian Armed Forces' needs in every domain in the -- in the current and in the future. In the current, our focus has been on capabilities that we can get them quickly, that they can use in the current fight in now east and south Ukraine. 

> So in terms of aviation, we've focused on how we can enhance their existing aircraft fleet. That's where the HARM missiles come into play, giving that -- them that additional advantage. We've also sourced from around the world, you know, thousands of spare parts for their MiGs.

We do not know with any certainty if Ukraine has ATACMS.

None of the footage so far has shown a missile hitting any of the distant targets that are beyond range of known Ukrainian capabilities.

All the footage starts after the first hit. Even when there are different hits, we cannot see a missile incoming.

There are lots of theories about each of the hits and for all we know, any of them could be valid for any of the strikes.

The supposed ATACMS footage from today doesn't definitively show a HIMARS loaded with ATACMS. https://twitter.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1560743445748076546?s=20&t=wVGDaY-gK7ZJJ1ZYa4mlTA

All we know is that the back of the pod is covered. If you search for images of ATACMS pods online, there is nothing distinguishing them from the regular GMLRS pods that we know Ukraine has.

http://www.military-today.com/missiles/atacms.jpg

Ok there you go, look at [this grainy ass photo of an ATACMS production line.](https://imgur.com/a/06x6pFs). The photo clearly shows two standard pods that have the exterior shape of six missiles when in fact, the interior clearly shows a round tube meant to contain one ATACMS.

So the original photo we saw could be anything really. GMLRS, ATACMS or something they really don't want you to see, like a [pod for the new PrSM missile.](https://preview.redd.it/bt5sg0xj8qr31.jpg?auto=webp&s=6a573be2fa4d73f175592478cdf68ad169380766) This pod would have two holes and they might want to obfuscate that. It could be that they simply don't want to show how many missiles are fired or available in that pod. It could be that they have different munitions, which are [marked a different color.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/IDF-M270-MLRS-Israel-60.jpg/300px-IDF-M270-MLRS-Israel-60.jpg)

What Airdefense Doing?

Everything Russia has fucked up the hardest has been air related; ""destroying"" Ukraine's air force on day one, having columns of vehicles and their accompanying air defense torn up by cheap TB2s during the assault on Kyiv, losing their flagship to a few anti-ship missiles, and now having their entire military infrastructure in occupied Ukraine systematically and inevitably destroyed by long range rockets and drones.

Russian Defense Ministry declared that ""supporting evidence with the results of all the analyses"" will be published without specifying the exact date.

The Ministry added an additional investigation had been launched into the sudden illness of the head of the Russian-installed administration of Kherson region, who was also evacuated to Russia with similar symptoms in early August.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin

>Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin (Russian: Александр Гельевич Дугин; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian political philosopher,[5] analyst, and strategist known for views widely characterized as fascist. Considered by some in the West to be ""Putin's brain,"" or ""Putin's philosopher,"" Dugin is believed by some to have laid the ideological groundwork for the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as part of his advocacy for Ukraine becoming ""a purely administrative sector of the Russian centralized state"", which he refers to as Novorossiya. Others contend that Dugin's influence within the Russian government has been greatly exaggerated, an impression given by correlations between his work and Russian foreign policy. Dugin calls for an illiberal totalitarian Russian Empire to control the Eurasian continent from Dublin to Vladivostok to challenge America and ""Atlanticism"".

>On 3 March 2022 the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned the outlet Geopolitika [ru] due to its alleged control by Dugin. Additionally, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Dugin's daughter Darya Aleksandrovna Dugina on the basis of her work as chief editor of the website United World International (UWI). According to the United States Department of the Treasury, UWI was developed as part of Project Lakhta, owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is held responsible for part of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.",False,1661034832.0,t3_wsxoxz,t1_il46l26,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

The defense, which was successful, was that the private aimed and fired his weapon according to his training - and, as a result, hit the saboteur center of mass, killing him.

 >The 2K25 Krasnopol is a Soviet 152/155 mm cannon-launched, fin-stabilized, base bleed-assisted, semi-automatic laser-guided, artillery weapon system. It automatically 'homes' on a point illuminated by a laser designator, typically operated by a drone or ground-based artillery observer. Krasnopol projectiles are fired mainly from Soviet self-propelled howitzers such as the 2S3 Akatsiya and 2S19 Msta-S and intended to engage small ground targets such as tanks, other direct fire weapons, strong-points, or other significant point targets visible to the observer.

>Pinned down and alone in that hole, Gorgan’s thoughts turned to the savior he wished he could hear coming over the horizon: the low bbrrrrrrrtt of an American-made A-10 Thunderbolt II jet, known as the Warthog, a cold war relic designed specifically for destroying Russian tanks advancing on infantry units. As a kid, Gorgan saw news footage of American A-10s bombing lines of Soviet-made Iraqi tanks during the first Gulf War. Images flooded his mind of the stubby attack plane with two bulbous jet engines mounted on its back and a gatling gun for a snout. Gorgan believes in God but at that moment, he wasn’t convinced God was going to save his life. “In that situation, there really has to be something tangible that can help you, and I thought about the A-10,” Gorgan told TIME. “I would be really lucky to hear the noise from his cannon.”

My point is only that his statement on this matter is his own and is no indication of the government's stance whatever that may be.

As regards the broader question: chairs almost always are from the majority/governing party.  I don't know what would count as a definitive source for the suggestion that committee chairs and governments often disagree, but recent prominent examples that spring to mind include both Jeremy Hunt (chair of the Health Select Committee) and Greg Clark (then chair of the Science and Technology Committee) who were very publicly critical of the government's handling of COVID.  Another example would of course be Tugendhat himself and his criticism of the government's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.  There was also the whole furore over Julian Lewis (chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee) and the Russia Report, which led to him having the whip withdrawn (officially because he worked with Labour to secure the chairmanship, but unofficially because his decision to publish the report embarrassed the government).",1661016486.0,1661013043.0,t3_wsxoxz,t1_il2y3tj,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Seems the ones in response to Covid were not single committees critical, there were over 100 members disgruntled about this.  And the afghani exit is propped up by a member that states “I don’t work for the prime minister, I don’t work for the Conservative party, I work for the people that sent me here.”  Which I highly respect in a political figure, if true.   These examples you refer to seem to be coming from a divide in the party, obvious by Johnson’s resignation.
