14 more bot accounts were taken care of today.

Most of the accounts were dormant up until the past couple of days. For example, one account may have been 5 years old and had *zero* activity until 06:30 UTC. Each subsequent account was reactivated within a few 15 minutes of each other. All of the sus accounts were active within 3 hours of the first one. 

A second batch was similarly activated 24 hours later, and likewise had accounts that were upwards of 9 years old, with zero activity until a similar time frame. 

Each of the sus accounts began posting on the sub within a few hours. The sus accounts also commented on the same threads on other subs but not this one as far as we can tell.

None of the sus accounts' posts or comments are visible on the sub and all the accounts were reported to the admins. It's unknown what the accounts intentions were but it's likely they were karma farming to post spam elsewhere.

The [last batch](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zwzq2p/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j20b5ot/) of accounts were mostly stopped by the admins, and the ones that slipped through ended up spamming domains or comment spammed an unrelated sub before finally being stopped.

- Ukraine was ranked 25 (15 now) in 2015.  Iran was 23 (17 now).  
- The [GFI](https://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.php) is a ""score with categories ranging from quantity of military units and financial standing to logistical capabilities and geography"" with a ""unique, in-house formula allows for smaller, more technologically-advanced, nations to compete with larger, lesser-developed powers and special modifiers, in the form of bonuses and penalties, are applied to further refine the list which is compiled annually.""  
- It is largely dependent on data provided by the countries themselves, which can be overestimated.  
- Since land area, population, and financial standing are factors, this is *not* reflective of relative raw military strength.  Russia for example has almost the same index as the US due to its land area.  Nevermind that it has 9000 fewer aircraft or half the population.  
- Some categories aren't applicable and yet still count as handicaps.  The US receives a handicap for not having frigates, despite being first in total naval assets and most naval categories.  Both the US and Russia (and Ukraine to a lesser extent) receive handicaps for national debt, which is a misunderstanding of national debt and the dynamics of debtor-nations.  
- Drone count and capabilities have been left out of the index completely.  

Really I find it a pretty arbitrary and misleading statistic and I don't know why it's something to get excited about.  Most of the factors are non-military.

So, rehash of what I said elsewhere, having binged BBC's Trauma Zone, which looks at the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union (with many scenes from Ukraine), and the subsequent collapse of democracy in Russia, the Ukrainian scenes are haunting me. Can't get them out of my head. And I learned something new... that documentary does a great job beautifully, simply explaining what happened in Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed. The communist leader ""switched sides"", changed the name ONLY of everything from 'Soviet' to 'National', and not a single fucking thing beyond that changed. They were still fully in Russia's chains. Ukraine didn't start from the same place as the Baltic states. It started from the same place as Belarus, as the most infamous Central Asian republics. It's mind-blowing how much progress they made from that starting point to Maidan.

And that's what my realization is... they had a momentum behind them that that I didn't even notice, and I imagine some others of us here didn't notice either. The progress they made from the collapse of the Soviet Union to Maidan is just as impressive as the Kharkiv offensive, as all their hard-fought, painful successes since Russia invaded. We are SO late to this party. Shamefully, embarrassingly late. The Ukrainians have been consciously, successfully, passionately fighting for their values, for our values, for decades.

Russia FEARS Ukraine.

They know that the best soliders, industry and science of the USSR was all Ukraine.

Russians despise Ukraine not because they consider them to be inferior, but because they know Ukraine is superior to them in many ways that are critical to Russia’s existence in its present form.

Without Ukraine, Russia will be forced to TRADE for essential industry and resources. Worse than that, Ukraine will be a peer Slavic competitor in many areas of trade and industry.

Authoritarian government in Russia will go into a permanent decline if Ukraine is lost to the Russian sphere of influence, because then Russia will have no choice but to start treating its neighbours as equals. Otherwise, those neighbours will simply decide to trade or cooperate with Ukraine instead.

“Traditional” Russians hate this idea. Being the bully is seen as a right. Losing this and having to learn to actually cooperate with their neighbours in good faith will be unbearable to the sense of entitlement in most Russians, especially the Russian upper classes.

An outcome where Russia has to deal with their partners as equal isn’t just disappointing, they see it as a total collapse of their cultural right to be the bully.

A few days ago, Russia announced that they were deploying an [advanced frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_frigate_Admiral_Gorshkov) armed with hypersonic, nuclear-tipped [missiles.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3M22_Zircon) Since it is part of their Atlantic fleet and since Turkey controls access to the Black Sea, this boat is of no immediate threat to Ukraine. Indeed, the purpose of the ship and the missiles it carries is to intimidate NATO as a [""New Year's gift](https://news.yahoo.com/russias-medvedev-snaps-back-u-163556858.html)"" for us to ""rejoice"" over. What a bunch of jackasses. 

So that got me into looking at any equivalent ships that the US is developing. All of these weird designs and weapons the US has revealed over the past decade or so seem to have been testing beds for consolidated, practical designs of the future, building off of the strengths of the experimental and existing designs of ships and weapons. 

The first is a consolidation of both the [Freedom-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom-class_littoral_combat_ship) and [Independence-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence-class_littoral_combat_ship) ships into a single [Constellation-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation-class_frigate) frigate. This consolidated design is a refinement of the close-range ""littoral"" ability of the other two test classes, but with greater deep-water offensive abilities. 

The second is a consolidation of three designs into one. First, all [Arleigh Burke-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer) destroyers and [Ticonderoga-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticonderoga-class_cruiser) cruisers are being consolidated into a single [next generation ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDG(X)), refining their designs and combining them with the lessons learned from the [Zumwalt-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zumwalt-class_destroyer). 

There is a shift to build more ships that are smaller, as opposed to fewer ships that are larger. Apparently, since the Zumwalt was so expensive, the project was cancelled and production restarted back on proven destroyer designs. 

There will also be an incorporation of technologies that have been tested. There seems to be more investment into hypersonic missiles, smaller-caliber guns, and laser weapons and a move away from [railguns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun). After billions of dollars and decades of research and testing, the US military determined that railguns were impractical and much cheaper alternatives could produce the same results. 

So in short order, as Russia keeps trying to maintain their [one carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_aircraft_carrier_Admiral_Kuznetsov) and showing off experimental weapons to intimidate, NATO has been developing weapons that are practical and designed to win wars with less bluster.",False,1673026850.0,t3_104k5bd,t3_104k5bd,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

Maybe that is true, maybe not.

However, on a wider picture, and impartially, Ukraine is winning every day that Kyiv does not fall. This is, on a macro scale, a war of attrition and it feels like Ukraine is correctly prioritising the right aspects of the modern battlefield, where Russia is stuck firmly in the mid 20th Century.

What I mean by that is that Ukraine is prioritising capability when it comes to force regeneration, Russia simply raw manpower. However, it's clear that numbers alone no longer have the power on the battlefield they once did, and Russia's strategy is not fit for purpose.

As a point of reference, the German machine gunner on Omaha Beach on D Day is generally considered, with somewhere in the ballpark of 1000-2000 kills in a single day, the deadliest person in frontline/infantry combat of the entire war. (Yes, I'm not considering naval warfare here because it's a totally different ballgame that's not the work of an individual, and I'm also ruling out the bombardiers of Enola Gay and Bockscar as their missions were not against armed combatants)

What Ukraine is focusing on is that well trained, well equipped troops operating the likes of a HIMARS launcher have the capability to inflict deaths on that order of magnitude every single day in business as usual mode. A guy on a laptop miles from the combat can operate a weapons platform (like a drone) that stops entire armoured columns in their tracks. The right platforms give you huge levels of fighting power without a corresponding substantial commitment of people.

Russia's focus seems to be on pure numbers, and not on how they're trained, equipped, or deployed.

consider them to be inferior, but because they know Ukraine is superior to them in many ways that are critical to Russia’s existence in its present form.

Authoritarian government in Russia will go into a permanent decline if Ukraine is lost to the Russian sphere of influence, because then Russia will have no choice but to start treating its neighbours as equals.

“Traditional” Russians hate this idea. Being the bully is seen as a right. Losing this and having to learn to actually cooperate with their neighbours in good faith will be unbearable to the sense of entitlement in most Russians, especially the Russian upper classes.",1673051283.0,1673051003.0,t3_104k5bd,t1_j399kps,,1,10,0,10,1,0,

That's not *impossible*, but it's extremely unlikely and - even if it were to be achieved - would take many years for Russia-friendly right-wing politicians in the West to win office and cut off support.

The absolute bare minimum amount of time this would take is ~2 years, and even that assumes an absolute tidal shift in US politics which not only cuts off its own support but pressures its NATO allies into doing the same. If we're being honest, a realistic guess at this 'win' would be 5-10 years out; it's possible a combination of war/spending fatigue plus economic/political cycles might undo the West's support over that time frame. (*Might*. I'd still give it less than coin-flip odds.)

So how does Russia hold onto stolen territory for years? Mass mobilization is the only answer, and it's still a poor one. Russia can slow Ukraine's advances by throwing waves of untrained conscripts, but probably not by enough. It's 2023. Lots of warm bodies in a trench don't stop offensives like they could in 1914. Particularly now that Ukraine is receiving additional armored vehicles, this kind of stalling will be even less effective. (Which is precisely why the West is giving it.) If Putin throws another 100k+ corpses at the problem, maybe he can slow the advance enough to still cling to some of Ukraine by the time the 2024 US elections roll around - and pray for a miracle that isn't coming. 

As others have said, the *only* exit for Russia is Putin's downfall. He'll keep stalling with conscripts, Russia will continue losing, and this goes on until Russians decide they're going to do something about it other than flee the country and hope it all blows over.

Ukraine mobilised early in the war, roughly 900k-1mil people. Ukraine has also been at total war footing for some time.

Russia probably needs double that to have a chance at offensive success, it's always easier to defend with fewer troops.

Many analysts were predicting mobilisation sooner for Russia just to meet basic numbers requirements but you probably know better than I why they only did a partial mobilisation.

Regardless, without enough equipment or training it's just more people to die. Ukraine has the benefit of allied supply and training. The allies train to a high standard. From all reports, Russian mobilised personnel are undertrained, underequipped and then used poorly to plug gaps.

If you can, get out now. If you can't, get ready to move around a lot to avoid the draft.

""The leaders discussed the abhorrent drone attacks on Ukraine in recent days,"" the spokesperson said in a statement issued after the two leaders spoke earlier in the day.

The big news recently has been IFV's. The UK simply has next to nothing to send that it hasn't sent already. The UK was one of the first, if not the first, to send armoured tracked vehicles to Ukraine. There's plenty of footage of CVRT storming around on the Kharkiv offensive.

We're an island nation without the need for a large army and huge costs in terms of airpower and the navy. Our heavy armour industry has been completely bollocksed by spending cuts and mismanagement and we don't have the manufacturing base that Germany has. Warrior and Challenger are out of production and desperately limited in numbers. Bulldog is shite and CVRT has already been sent (might have a few more spare soon hopefully).

 >The Remote Anti-Armor Mine System (RAAMS) are two types of 155mm howitzer projectiles containing nine anti-tank mines each: the M718 or M718A1 (RAAM-L) with a self-destruct time over 24 hours and the M741 or M741A1 (RAAM-S) with a self-destruct time under 24 hours. Both projectiles are used with the M577 or M577A1 Mechanical Time and Superquick (MTSQ) fuze, which triggers the ejection mechanism of the mines above enemy territory after a preset time. These mines can be delivered at ranges from 4 to 17. 6 kilometers from the artillery battery position using either the M109 series or M198 or M777 series howitzers.

The second thing is that while a coming offensive (when/where) may be news to Reddit et. al., it's not news at all to anyone with military-grade surveillance systems.   Militaries don't wake up in the morning and tell soldiers ""OK, time to go on an attack"".  Well, Russia did, and we saw how well that worked... but even that level of ""surprise"" included months and months of buildup and preparation that everyone could see.  You have to get tons of gasoline and ammunition into hundreds of vehicles, and into hundreds of refuelling and reloading caches... and food and soldiers all staged and prepared... and they end up in tents and cooking food and closer to somewhere than they were the day before... etc. 

... it's really really difficult to hide all that. 

So Russias MoD can see the buildup and knows an offense is coming.  And they can estimate approximately when and approximately where.  

By being public about a when, and sometimes even a where, you force military planners to at least be prepared for that when/where.  Imagine being the general if your forces get overrun exactly there and then, and you didn't have defense well planned...  not gonna be good on the ol resume, that's for sure.

But, just in case it's disinformation, you still also have to be prepared for a different when/where.    Because it might be a trick.

And obviously, if you tell the enemy where you are heading, you can still choose to head somewhere else.  Because being the attacking general can easily say ""Because I'm not a complete idiot"" when asked ""why didn't you attack when and where you said you would?... 

As a result, by telegraphing a when/where you know that at least some of the enemy forces will be pinned exactly there, and logistics will be set up for exactly then.",False,1673027561.0,t3_104k5bd,t1_j37n0yv,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

What we're talking about is the ""sedition caucus"".  Roughly 20-30 house members; unfortunately, very much in-control of the party (and by extension, the House, and by extension the legislative agenda).

But real facts here:  I count McCarthy as a member of the ""sedition caucus"" because he DID vote to overturn the election. (despite his complaining over the Jan 6 insurrection: he was still on their side).

So what this is about is a fracture of the ""sedition caucus"", a very small minority of 6 of them, are trying to bully the feint-hearted 20 or so other members into giving them concessions, which amount to full control over the entire Republican side of the House.  They're leveraging a very specific rule, and their narrow margin, in order to force a standoff - which is currently in stalemate.

As it appears now (next few hours may prove me wrong), those 6 extreme sedition caucus members will NEVER vote for McCarthy, and are just playing the rest of Congress by pretending to bargain.  It will be VERY bad if they ""win"".  

The only winning play right now, is if some Republicans join the Democrats to select a Moderate. 

Otherwise, that ""bipartisan"" support for Ukraine will mean nothing, because these guys can literally paralyze the entire congress, unless either the math in the spread changes, or some of the sedition caucus not currently on their side, switch sides and go full-bore sedition.

Initially there nobody was certain Ukraine, once that was established then you can start sending better aid. But sending Abrams/F16 makes little sense initially as there was no way for Ukraine to support them logistically or protect high value assets from the plethora of missile attacks.

Now that Ukraine has stabilized the fronts and managed to put together an effective air defense system and lots of logistics practice it makes more sense to bring high value assets in. Now is when I would expect the feature creep of greater and greater arms coming to Ukraine to start happening. Lining up with their ability to protect the skies, training units coming back and stabilized front.

Personally, I don't think Abrams/F16 ever happen while the conflict is hot. I actually think we're more likely to see Gripen/Rafale show up in Ukraine.

Germany built over 3000 Marders and they've been heavily exported and upgraded, versus Warrior at something like 750 vehicles that hasn't been exported or upgraded. More importantly, Germany already has their replacement vehicle for the Marder in service. The UK is currenting using Warrior in the IFV role and in the Recce role and replacement for both roles are either non-existant or a long way from service. S

So the UK has old, clapped out vehicles (now more like 400 than 750) that are being heavily relied upon by the British Army and have no replacement. Germany has hundreds of vehicles that are about to leave service plus hundreds more available from partner countries or on the open market. For example a German arms company asked the German Government for an export licence to sell Ukraine 100 Marders that they held freely as a private company (which the German Government denied). Frustratingly the German government recently gave the Greeks 100 Marders themselves in a 'ringtaush' deal whereby the Greeks would send the Ukrainian 100 deathtrap BMP-1's.

So basically Warrior is not particularly good for Ukraine and definitely isn't available. Marder is useful for Ukraine (otherwise the Greeks wouldn't want it) and is available in large numbers and from more places than the German Government stocks.

If you're going to bring up an example of a European IFV that would be suitable for this kind of thing, it would be the CV-90.

But it turns out, just throwing money at a problem doesn't always fix it, and often makes things much worse.

>The naïve assumption was that when Russia transitioned to a free market economy they would have more political freedom

The naive assumption was that when western countries, financial institutions, and etc started doing business with Russia, that they'd enforce sane financial rules to prevent Russian organized crime from gaining a foothold. (this was western stipulation against helping Ukraine in 2014 - and was a HUGE problem for them!)

Instead, the piggies lined up to the trough, like you'd expect good amoral capitalists to do, and they fed and fed, and got rich and fat, and so did Russian oligarchs, and organized crime. 

So it should be no mystery: how Russia got to where they are today. 

Russia should have been FORCED (by the international community, and the west) to do business lawfully, or to fuck off.  I posit that none of this would have happened.  As awful as the collapse of the USSR was, her people had such great potential. It was squandered for the enrichment of plundering pirates. 

And worse; Russia has gained deep influence in many western countries, including the USA, UK, Germany, and their toxic politics are infecting dozens of other nations, spreading the disease of nationalism, populism, and fascism around the world, and endangering the very future of liberal democracy, and even the modern Enlightenment (given that they're objectively trying to bring back the horrors of the medieval Mongol expansion to their modern warfare practices).",False,1673048244.0,t3_104k5bd,t1_j396j3w,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Most churches seem to exist to scare people into submission and promote some political agenda, and having to follow some bizarre rituals on the pain of eternal damnation is absolutely not the point.

Those were due to laying artillery fire down on attacking forces. Going over and out of the trench because you *had* to take ground eventually. It's why your artillery would TRY to attack their artillery right as the attack commenced so they hopefully wouldn't obliterate your men out in No Man's Land.

Could you kill people with direct hits on trenches? Yes, but it was not even close to as effective, especially with the way they learned how to build trenches (trenches having those turns and whatnot instead of being a straight line minimized casualties from a direct hit). Hitting a trench directly is still a mathematically low thing to happen, especially when your doctrine is ""just shoot as much as possible."" They shelled trenches to suppress, not kill.

There are, of course, not ENOUGH smart ordnance pieces to be everywhere or fire as often, but also Russia has been using *less* shells in Bakhmut compared to other areas because both sides are blowing through their reserves.

Russian artillery has been effective in most of the situations, but I don't agree on static vs maneuver here. Trenches are effective against artillery, even modern artillery. That's why the whole ""drone grenade drop"" thing has been so popular in this war. It's ""artillery"" without the artillery weakness against entrenchment.

Holed up in a building that can collapse? Yeah artillery is going to do a number on you. Platoon caught in the open by a drone spotter? Yup, bad news. But trenches can greatly protect your position and that's why both sides have dug them where possible now that things are more static.
