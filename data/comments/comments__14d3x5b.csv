>
>Convened by President Emmanuel Macron on the sidelines of the Paris Air Show, French officials describe the event as a forum for debate among EU defence ministers, US and NATO military officials, and industry executives.
>

>
>German chancellor Olaf Scholz unveiled Sky Shield last October to create a European air and missile defence system by jointly procuring equipment, and 17 countries have since signed up, including the UK, the Baltic states, Sweden and Finland. 
>
>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its heavy use of munitions and missiles to attack from the skies were a wake-up call that Europe could no longer neglect its air defences. “We have a lot of catching up to do in Europe”, Scholz said in an August speech setting out his vision for air defence.
>
>But key countries such as France, Italy and Poland have remained on the sidelines, showing the challenges of overcoming national industrial interests even as military budgets are ramping up across Europe. Paris in particular was caught off guard by Sky Shield’s announcement and postponed a Franco-German summit in part to signal its pique.
>
>While French and German officials have avoided public criticism of each other’s plans, differences are evident behind the scenes. Germany initially planned to send a senior official instead of defence minister Boris Pistorius, but changed course over the weekend.

""While formally the cause of Memorial’s legal woes was its failure to consistently brand itself as a foreign agent in all of its public statements, the words of the prosecutor left little doubt as to the real reason behind the state’s hostility. Memorial’s crime was simply its commitment to commemorating the victims of Soviet-era state violence. As state prosecutor Aleksei Zhafiarov put it during the hearings that led to Memorial’s liquidation, “Why should we, the descendants of victorious people, feel shame and repent, rather than pride ourselves on our glorious past?” The organization’s keen gaze at state terror, he made clear, was perceived by the Russian state as actively harmful in the present.""",False,1687186166.0,t3_14d3x5b,t3_14d3x5b,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

The claim is that the final frag at the end was [WarGonzo](https://twitter.com/GloOouD/status/1670816273633095688). Feel free to offer addendums as you see fit. Most of the information is speculative: 

* The guy in the blue shirt looks exactly like WarGonzo. 

* The Russian military enforced shaving on their conscripts back in October or September. No idea if this is still something they care about, but if it is then it shows this guy wasn't part of the Russian military proper. 

* The guy in the blue shirt is wearing only perfunctory military equipment. Everything else is civilian. I did not see spare magazines. 

* The guy in the blue shirt has the capability of keeping his shirt blue and (somewhat) clean. He has access to laundry facilities. 

* The WarGonzo telegram channel posted three updates (so far) on June 19th. 

* This trench is well maintained and developed, which implies a rear defensive position. Possibly even the primary trench line (which, if so, then...oof), exactly where a war correspondent would go.

A good source for what is happening there is the pro-Ukraine source, Volnovakha.city website. 

They examine photos from today taken by Russians, get reports from locals.  Apparently, the civilians were Russian civil employees (fake government admin, contactors, and collaborators).  The school—used by military.  Although multiple locations have damage...

The locals say the school attack was “Russian provocation” to turn the locals against Ukraine, fearing upcoming offensive and locals loyalties.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-19-23/index.html

""NATO will not issue a formal invitation to Ukraine to join the military alliance during a high-profile summit in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, in July, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said Monday. 

“At the Vilnius summit and in the preparations for the summit, we're not discussing to issue a formal invitation. What we are discussing is how to move Ukraine closer to NATO,” Stoltenberg told journalists during a joint press conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin.

The secretary general added that although consultations are ongoing regarding Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, he is “not in a position to pre-empt the outcome of these consultations.”

“What I can say is that the Allies actually already agree on a lot,” Stoltenberg remarked, referencing NATO’s membership invitations to Finland and Sweden as an example. 

“We also agree on what we stated in 2008 that Ukraine will become a member of the alliance. We also agree that is not for Russia, but for Ukraine and NATO allies, to decide when the time is right to invite Ukraine,” Stoltenberg added. 

Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, has pressed Stoltenberg on previous occasions to commit to a timeframe for Ukraine’s membership bid.

During a visit to Moldova in early June, Zelensky stressed that Ukraine “is ready to be in NATO and is merely “waiting [for] when NATO will be ready.”""",False,1687183180.0,t3_14d3x5b,t3_14d3x5b,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

I did fencing in HS back in the late 90s, and all the coaches at our local club were Ukrainian. Very talented, one was an Olympic-level coach, they'd defected during the Cold War. They ran a training camp over the summer. I went, and the one of the guys had brought an N64 that we set up in the boys dorm. Naturally, we played a ton of Goldeneye.

At one point, the head coach came in while someone was doing single player. Watches as we're sitting around, laughing as they shoot up these NPCs. After a while, he speaks up: ""Is Red Army?""

Now, I think a lot of us were actually kind of scared. Back then, as dumb kids, barely in the post Cold War era, we didn't really understand what the difference between Russia and Ukraine was, other that the Soviet Union had broken up to all these little countries. But maybe they were still friends, you know? So maybe he's mad, that we're playing this game about shooting 'his' people. Someone answers yes.

For Americans: If you do electricity work in the US, as far as I know you have to be a licensed electrician. Well, same thing in Europe, but if you are a licensed electrician in Poland, you can work, say, in France with your Polish qualification. For that stuff to work, the EU has to set the minimum standards.

This goes for everything else too: How to label products properly, how does an ingredients list look like, how is meat treated and inspected, eggs, vegetables, safety and compliance of electronic products (for Americans: ""FCC-compliance"") etc. etc.

All these standards are set (EU-lingo: ""harmonized"") across the EU by the EU, so if a country wants to join, all their laws have to align with that wall-to-wall bookshelf of standards. This takes time, even if the country is really interested in joining.

There is also a certain amount of care taken that your country's economy won't be destroyed when you join. Yes, if you join ""wrong"", it could actually be harmful, for example, if you have a large state-subsidized industry that employs a lot of people and you join the EU, guess what? You can't subsidize anymore and the industry goes poof overnight, leaving many unhappy, unemployed workers behind.

Ukraine getting into NATO at least solves the problem of random missile barrages, border incursions, another convenient ""uprising"", or another outright invasion. The only thing Putin respects is that which he fears, and he is scared shitless by NATO. Ukraine getting into NATO at least ensures that the Russian military will be hands-off (at least overtly) with Ukraine in the future.

>Abstract

>A device for the aerial release of mosquitoes includes an unmanned aerial vehicle operable by remote control. It carries a container holding a central processing unit and a mosquito breeding bin, which is a self-contained volume housing mosquitoes and a mosquito food having a toxin suitable to be transmitted by mosquito bite after the mosquito consumes the mosquito food. A release tube is connected to the mosquito breeding bin and sized to release mosquitoes from the mosquito breeding bin. A valve is connected to the release tube and is operable by remote control so that when opened, the mosquitoes have an open pathway out of the container through the release tube.

On the plus side, there is this:

>For example, one unquestionably legal application of the toxic mosquito delivery system is immunization made possible by adding a toxin, that is, a genetically modified bacterium capable of activating a person's immune system to fight malaria, to mosquitoes. Those contaminated mosquitoes could be aerially released to immunize at risk populations against malaria.

Also, after the Crimean War Russia sold the U.S. Alaska for pennies on the dollar and that too came with a lot of mosquitos. So if Russians prefer not to be bitten by Ukrainian mosquitos due to their destroying the dam, they could always just leave. Belarusians will likely still be bitten.",1687210923.0,1687210738.0,t3_14d3x5b,t1_joqxqi6,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

The Russians will have to react and by watching where and how those supply trucks are redirected Ukraine can learn quite a bit about what Russia considers to be the weakspots. This won't be a fast process, as Russian logistic efforts are limit to the speed of a train and further bottlenecked by Private Conscriptovich's ability to crossload between transport modes by hand.

Slow the pace of advance down enough to bait the grunts behind the guns into using ammo they can't replace right now, then push when the supply dip has moved from the rear areas up to the front lines.

It effects the rest of the 21st century.  Everyone is mad at the Russia right now but they are people and abandoning them in a pit with these monsters is inappropriate if alternatives are possible. 

Reparations payments are essential for Ukraine.  Also i think the only area where EU and USA should have a voice or take action.  We can pay some of the reparations bill.  Most reconstruction for Ukraine can be paid with Russian gas.  Ukraine could agree to a 40 year moratorium on gas drilling.  Russia can agree to set the price high enough that renewable energy is competitive.  

Sometimes land seams like some holy cow people worship.  But that is how people are.  There is no reason the Russia should expect to be allowed to annex territory.  If people in DPR want to not be Ukrainian they need to learn non-violent action.

Ever since they had to retreat from Kyiv it was obvious that Ukraine won and the only thing that remains to determine is how hard Russia will lose.

The only way anyone can look at this and say that Russia is winning, is by virtue of controlling more territory than they had before the invasion. But they are losing:
1. Militarily - they lost many of their best troops, thousands of tanks, APCs, artillery guns, and other equipment. They also burned through a lot of soviet stockpiles, which, while vast, are not unlimited and once they're gone, they're gone. Russia has nowhere near the manufacturing capacity of the USSR.
2. Diplomatically - they are more isolated than ever, their only true friends are backwater dictatorships, and countries like India and China are only friendly to them as long as they can get good deals out of them.
3. Economically - sanctions, people dead in the war and fleeing from mobilisation are wrecking their economy. It's a slow process, but once they run out of their financial reserves their economy is going to head straight to gutter.

Overall, Russia is in a much worse position today than they were before this full scale invasion, even if they were to keep the stolen territories (which I have faith they will not).",False,1687179748.0,t3_14d3x5b,t1_jop2cdu,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

No, they are not. The war isn't a stale-mate, and Ukraine is making gains even in probing attacks. The only major gains Russia made were from local governments who folded prior to any military conflict. Russia has made zero decisive military victories in this war. Ukraine has made several.

>The Ukraine is obviously loosing, and slightly less obviously Europe is loosing hard

Your bias is showing. It's not *the Ukraine,* it's just Ukraine. Neither party is obviously losing. NATO and the EU are more united than they've been in decades, and the EU is finally stepping up war production. Ukraine is, again, taking major military victories.

>Russia is screwing us hard, like a professional poker player who's playing aggressively, against a bunch of noobs.

Lol, no they are not. Russia has screwed itself hard. The US war machine hasn't even woken up from the nap it has been taking since WW2. You forget that once we put the pedal to the metal, we start rationing and growing crops in our backyard, and are *very* willing to sacrifice to ensure that the Nazis do not win. Russia is going all in, we've barely put in a small blind.

> For Russians they don't even care they might have inconvenienced a generation of young people, as long as they're winning long term.

They aren't. Russia has burned far more bridges with this invasion than they can hope to rebuild long term. Their market is considered *highly* unstable because the west isn't putting up with the imperialism, and the eastern markets aren't large enough to compensate for the loss of western markets.

In my opinion the counteroffensive is going through some teething issues that the Ukrainians are trying to work through. From what I’ve seen so far, the minefields have been more of an obstacle than expected and really slowed stuff down, as well as Russian air support from stuff like ka-52s being a problem. They will of course try to adapt and find solutions to those issues and try again under more favourable circumstances.

These reports are consistent with ISW’s recent observations of the scale and approach of localized Ukrainian counterattacks in southern and eastern Ukraine. ISW has previously noted that Ukraine has not yet committed the majority of its available forces to counteroffensive operations and has not yet launched its main effort.

""Long lines to vote have been a pervasive problem in Georgia for many years, particularly in the highly populous and fast-growing precincts in the metro Atlanta area. Some advocacy groups see the provision as specifically targeting grassroots organizations who helped voters deal with long lines.   
Previously, the law only banned explicit electioneering within 150 feet of the polls, not volunteers handing out free supplies.   
As election officials and poll workers were tasked with running an election during a pandemic and holding their first election using Georgia's relatively new Dominion Voting Systems equipment, voters faced hours-long lines  in Georgia's June 2020 presidential and congressional primaries and during early voting for the November presidential election.""

If your law restricts absentee voting, drop boxes, it will increase same day voting--coinkidinkally in minority districts where same day voting is large--and thus the lines and time.  Unless the law provides for a shit ton of expenses on increases polling places and equipment in minority areas.

02d1e49f4a25bf889e813bcbc89f6f52,14d3x5b,jos8bck,"WE probably agree on most, but I think you are a bit naive.Long lines in Atlanta minority districts have been a thing for 40 years since after the Civil Rights Act actually enabled black to vote and they have not been fixed; discouraging mail voting will increase lines 40% or more, based on the recent primary decrease in mail voting.In Houston living there for 25 years, the 3rd and 5th Wards (mostly poor blacks) were notorious for long lines and Houston is not a white majority area.  To further color this, the sheriff and police at Prairie View University (halfway between Houston and Austin and a minority university) threatened for years to arrest college voters for not being qualified to vote, even though they had registered.  This persisted through the 2016, although I think under Obama the sheriff finally got reigned in by a cease and desist.  I knew about this when I was in Abilene in the 70's.

So I'm very skeptical about any such legislation, in Southern states formerly under the Civil Rights Act until John Roberts gutted it, particularly now if it discourages mail voting, unless takes aggressive steps with appropriations and other measures to increase polling. I guess we'll see in 2024 but in my long experience this will do the job of decreasing minority and youth voting, which was the point.  Biden won Georgia by 14k; they don't have to do much to discourage voting to achieve their goal. And as always the cruelty is the point.  I hope I'm wrong but in 40 years of observing the South I doubt it.  The law at least allows a lot of options for verifying (25% of voters by the way do not have licenses or state ID, almost all in minority district--which I'm sure is ""an accident"") but it requires an application and decreases the time for mail voting.  The point, quite obviously, is to discourage mail voting, particularly by minorities.

I will add that voter fraud is extremely rare, and the few cases that did occur were a) GOP voters, b) former felons in Florida who were told they could vote by election officials then prosecuted after the fact.

So yea, I'm paranoid, not hyperbolic.  I know the South far too well having lived there.  I'm in Nevada with mail voting, so it's no skin off my nose; I'm not in Vegas standing in a polling line.
