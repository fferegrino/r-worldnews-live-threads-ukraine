Day 225 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was very quiet, they didn’t send any kamikaze drones at us this time, and there was no shelling or missile strikes. With those drones from yesterday they damaged some industrial facilities, not sure which ones exactly, but judging by the photos there wasn’t much damage, and thankfully there were no casualties. 

They are using those Shahed drones *a lot* now, they almost entirely switched to using them instead of using their missiles, I guess they really want to conserve them. Just today they launched at least 4-6 Shaheds at various cities. Three were intercepted over Odesa, at least one managed to reach its target in Zaporizhzhia, but we don’t know what that target was yet.

They do still use their missiles, but much less than before, when they had no Shaheds. Just yesterday they fired a ton of S-300 missiles at Zaporizhzhia, at least 7 of them hit apartment buildings. There were no military targets anywhere nearby, they just wanted to kill civilians, and they did. They killed at least 7 people, and another 5 are declared missing. Entire sections of the apartment buildings were completely destroyed, and 21 people were rescued from under the rubble. What did they gain from killing civilians yet again? It just shows their desperation, they are unable to fight against our army, so they fight against unarmed civilians, far away from the frontline, who can’t fight back.",False,1665105361.0,t3_xwvj7l,t3_xwvj7l,,0,163,0,163,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

*First: Prime Minister* Mikhail Mishustin—Russian press disclosed that he opposed the invasion.  He verified this in an interview late March, but said he’d make no public statement regarding this, as his opposition was stated privately and directly to Putin, and so he’ll just keep his head down and focus on his assigned tasks. 

*Second: Chair of the Federation Council* (upper house), Valentina Matviyenko.  Both she and her late husband were born in Ukraine, under USSR days.  She’s thus far been very pro-invasion, pro- reunite ‘historical’ Russia.

*Third: Speaker of the State Duma* (lower house), Vyacheslav Volodin—he’s been pro-invasion, pro-expansionism. 

**Why important today**:  [Matviyenko is trying to reach out to her counterparts in Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war.](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2022/10/6/7370636/) 

Analysis:  this is most likely because Zelensky has closed the door to negotiations (presumably from the Kozak-Yermak teams, due to annexation).  Since Russia wants to keep open (either for illusionary reason or to drive wedge), and since PM Shmygal previously led a team in talks, the Kremlin had this counterpart, the top parliamentarian, pretend to want to negotiate.  **Let’s not be fooled she’s sincere**, ready to capitulate, ready to withdraw, or has any power without the consent of Putin.  She radically supports the invasion and annexation of Ukraine.

What I've seen however from Ukraine makes me think they have managed this very well by commiting half-ish their troops to push forward and then they cycle those out for rest and the next round arrives fresh and fully equipped with NATO gear.  

Remember some of the Karkiv region gains the soldiers heading along the roads into battle looked fresh and new... that was a couple days after they had taken the region so I think what UKR has been doing is moving forward with half of their 'mass' and keeping the other half in the wings to press after that so basically they can chase the retreating c*nts non stop with fresh troops, never letting them stop long enough to dig any sort of defensive positions.

Соответствующие письма рассылают администрации районов города. В частности, в Выборгском руководителям предприятий предписали обеспечить явку ""незамедлительно"", передаёт ""Фонтанка"".  
С 6 октября бизнесу велено передать в комитет госслужбы Смольного данные о количестве сотрудников с мобилизационным предписанием. Также предпринимателей предупредили о визитах военных комиссаров, которые будут вручать повестки.  
Кроме того, представителей бизнеса просят предоставить информацию о незаменимых сотрудниках, на которых должна распространяться бронь от мобилизации. Для этого надо заполнить форму обратной связи на сайте Центра развития и поддержки предпринимательства.  
Как писал ""ДП"", Путин указал на ошибки Минобороны во время частичной мобилизации. По его словам, Минобороны доложило, что целый ряд категорий граждан нет необходимости призывать в рамках мобилизации, но соответствующих изменений в нормативно-правовую базу своевременно не внесли.  


Translation:

St. Petersburg companies began to receive requests for help to recruit mobilized from the authorities. Businesses are asked to send employees to the military registration and enlistment offices even before the subpoenas are served. Corresponding letters are sent to the administrations of the districts of the city. In particular, in Vyborgsky, the heads of enterprises were ordered to ensure their turnout ""immediately,"" Fontanka reports.  
  
Since October 6, businesses have been ordered to submit data on the number of employees with a mobilization order to the Smolny Civil Service Committee. Also, entrepreneurs were warned about the visits of military commissars, who will hand over summonses. In addition, business representatives are asked to provide information on essential employees who should be covered by the mobilization reservation.  
  
To do this, fill out the feedback form on the website of the Center for the Development and Support of Entrepreneurship. As ""DP"" wrote, Putin pointed out the mistakes of the Ministry of Defense during the partial mobilization. According to him, the Ministry of Defense reported that a number of categories of citizens do not need to be called up as part of mobilization, but the corresponding changes were not made to the regulatory framework in a timely manner.

It claims to be either a person/the unit itself posting from the 205th seperate motor rifle brigade of the Russian Army, the title of the telegram page is the same as the unit 205-я отдельная мотострелковая бригада

It seems suspect. After apparently being routed from position and fleeing for their lives, this same person has time to repost a lot of videos popular in  Ukrainian telegrams/ threads like here on reddit. It only has 8000 subscribers as well and was only started just in September. Within days of being opened the account already posted things relevant to Ukrainian success near Izyum, all the while posting a few occasional videos of generic Russian combat activities. It's just a really odd assortment of information that is favorable to Ukraine, and criticisms of Russian military leadership and the government. It really gives me strong canadianukraine vibes.

The worst nail in the coffin for me is that I can't find any videos from the telegram that are actually unique. Just videos from other sources. If you were really on the ground in Ukraine fighting, and felt the need to post hourly on a telegram page, you'd probably post some of your own pictures/videos... right?

tl;dr: we may have been bamboozled, quite possibly fooled even, perhaps hoodwinked or jebaited.

Putin's inner circle.  So here's my hot take: 

First, I wish it were a good sign. But honestly I think its neutral or only slightly in favor of the good guys.  Mind you, there are those that would say that the fact that these arguments are public at all is a surefire sign of cracking.  And I think there is some merit to that. But honestly, I think this is more likely:

If you rule buy fear, having all those powerful enough to oppose you fighting among themselves benefits only one person, the existing leadership. it is by design and its right out of Stalin's playbook.- I.E. you only get to the inner circle if you have natural enemies there. Its a feature, not a bug. 

Problem in Russian/Soviet history is that after Zhukov backed Kruschev's play to hold the reigns after Stalin died. Soviet/Russian leadership could tolerate no more Zhukovs. So and over the course of time the political leadership gradually emasculated the Red Army, which together with its predecessor was already rife with corruption. See Gogol, Dead Souls.  Last guy they had that was worth a damn was Alexander Lebed, and they killed him, tout suite.  And that is why they find themselves in the position they are in now. 

All to say, until Putin dies, consider stone throwing among his inner circle a Russian Tradition.  The moment he dies however, expect to see those same rocks turned into knives.",False,1665030257.0,t3_xwvj7l,t3_xwvj7l,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

While such prospects are important to the country’s postwar reconstruction, they are secondary to questions concerning its security, sovereignty and survival.

Putin is fully aware of the reprocussions of a tactical nuke strike, both in terms of the US conventional response and losing China and India's support.

Putin does not want to die and will do anything in his power to stay alive for as long as possible, even it it means making this a protracted conflict for years of shelling and what not. The man is sending thousands of troops to unsuccessfully be trained in Belarus and is sourcing winter coats and over 100,000 bullet proof vests from other countries. The OPEC behavior also seems like Putin wants to cause long term damage in the energy sector as well. 

&#x200B;

He still has a lot of ways he can sell this narratively to the Russian people. He controls the media and allows the controlled opposition. It seems like they may be setting up Shoigu as the fall guy here.

It's not a red button. And everyone involved in the process knows whats at stake with such behavior. And a lot of the people involved in the process are also those who would benefit from a changing of the guard aka ""coup"". Even if Putin wanted to Nuke from day 1 he probably hasn't because he knows such could immediately instigate a coup. People want to survive LOL. The russian elite are suffering but are still beyond wealthy. More than half of the russian country still supports the war and hates the west.

Kurganov, who grew up in Germany and earned $18 million through gambling, replaced members of Musk’s security detail with his own hires and was eventually given $5.7 billion in Tesla shares to donate — a compromise move that followed Birchall rejecting Musk’s proposal to let Kurganov run all of his charitable giving.",False,1665067394.0,t3_xwvj7l,t3_xwvj7l,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Such a dramatic escalation by Putin, though, would ultimately prove counterproductive. Russia developed these weapons during the Cold War to destroy massed ranks of heavy armour, thereby allowing its forces to break through Western defences. But, in Ukraine, there are no massed ranks of heavy armour to attack, and no Russian forces standing ready to launch an offensive.  
Putin’s nuclear sabre-rattling, therefore, is nothing more than another example of his erratic and delusional behaviour. All the more reason, then, for the West to ensure that he suffers a total and humiliating defeat, one that sends an unequivocal message to other autocratic regimes that any future acts of unprovoked aggression will suffer a similar fate.

Ukraine will push the Russians back to the 2012 borders but due to a number of reasons not pursue them across the border. Putin knows this and neither Ukraine or NATO have any desire to cross this line.So this will end up being a long term border war with a portion of Ukraines side of the border remaining as a buffer zone. Putin will continue the war as a border conflict so as to maintain power at home because as long as they are technically engaged in hostilities he can keep a reign on opposition at home while keeping the bulk of what’s left of his army in the border regions and away from him. Russia will continue to suffer economically but he will still be in charge similar to Kim Jong Un.

Ukraine with NATO, more HIMARS support  etc., clearly has the capacity to drive Russia straight out of Crimea even. But Russia can continue missile/drone attacks without any fear Ukraine will return fire into Russia. It may be a hard one to ""end"", and it's easy to see a situation where that continues with Russia periodically attacking and working to destabilize any sense of peace. Ukraine, like Allied countries after WW2 has a lot of rebuilding and political shuffling to account for what has happened. So much has been fought for and lost, and there will be expectations for a better quality of life. They have fought in a war where all of our security is at risk, and will not be content to remain a buffer between Russia and the world they want to join. Russia meanwhile can lick its wounds and rearm - it is now clearly a full fascist-autocratic state now with marshal law, conscription, and warring factions within the government. Putin's grip within Russia has increased, and he can act unfettered by the time spent pretending it is a democracy.

With an eye on the future and stability, I say it is time for NATO to finally step in with boots on the ground with focus on rebuilding Ukraine. Make clear this war has been won, and that moving forwards, any attack on Ukraine is an attack on all of us.

It won't work of course, but it's a thought.

What I've seen however from Ukraine makes me think they have managed this very well by commiting half-ish their troops to push forward and then they cycle those out for rest and the next round arrives fresh and fully equipped with NATO gear.  

Remember some of the Karkiv region gains the soldiers heading along the roads into battle looked fresh and new... that was a couple days after they had taken the region so I think what UKR has been doing is moving forward with half of their 'mass' and keeping the other half in the wings to press after that so basically they can chase the retreating c*nts non stop with fresh troops, never letting them stop long enough to dig any sort of defensive positions.

Questions, as I am not 100% familiar with the inner workings of the upper Russian political system in the day-to-day sense:

1) What is the relationship between Mishustin and Matviyenko?

2) How genuine was Matviyenko's pro-invasion voice?  Being pro-unification in Feb in Russia being very different than in even April, and in public being very different than in private.

I would presume Putin's feeling his oats, and replacing him with someone more normal is a step in the right direction, especially if it gives a veneer of legitimacy; having him die ""mysteriously"" or ""through old age"" or ""through radicals"" or something would solve a lot of problems.

https://www.bbc.com/russian/news-63134219

It says that including loses in Lyman (9 dead and 1-2 heavily wounded) they accounted for 46 dead soldiers of that brigade total. Considering the number of wounded to dead is on average 3.5:1 they assess around 200 people left the brigade at least temporarily. 

3rd brigade looking at it's structure can have between 1200 and 1600 soldiers. BBC is approximating that recon companies make about 300 people - hence that title. They are saying that 3rd brigade could lose up to 75% of it's recon force. 

That's why I was surprised by that number - I don't have any love to Russians, but I remember one of the special forces meeting. 3rd was considered one of the best trained, including psychological training, unit for covert ops. They have signal specialists (think hackers), they have force recon, they have teams that are prepared to stay behind enemy lines for years. 
They also can support line units if there is a need - and there was in Lyman. Probably they were the ones that organized the first evac column when Lyman did receive the order to slow down UA as much as possible and then they lost contact with HQ. No, I'm not exaggerating - most of the soldiers on Lyman were just normal members with maybe some experience, those guys are the real deal.

Fact is that type of assassination was completely misguided, and driven by revenge rather than any real battlefield purpose. It only has the result to further harden the two sides against one another. And before you think ""that is not possible"", you are absolutely wrong. Russia's elite care nothing for Ukraine other than that it is a plaything in their political objectives, they do not hate Ukraine, its people or its leaders. If you make it personal however, that will change. You will not only get reprisal attacks against (family members of) Ukrainian leadership, not just now but also in 10 years (long memories) but this is also how you get more civilian infrastructure bombed. The Russian elite would absolutely retaliate against such attacks by targeting critical Ukrainian infrastructure and killing more civilians, just to send a message. 

The fact is you will always lose this kind of warfare with Russia, because you are simply not willing to stoop as low as they are. So it's just a bad idea to engage in it. 

So the US had every interest to put a stop to it. They've essentially told Russia: ""This was not us, and we will not engage in this, in fact - we think this behaviour is so bad we will not support our ally in this"".

Unlike other places, the Ukranian can't leave a ""golden bridge"" to retreat for the Kherson troops. Kherson might have a good bulk of the Crimea garrison and there is supposed to be the best that the Russian army has to offer. So capturing those troops is necessary, this means that either those troops surrender in mass or it will take a Mariupol style of hard fighting to take it.

Unless I am missing something, which I might, the Ukranians would need to be very stupid if they leave a path to retreat for the Kherson troops.

The retreating forces have a few choices, they can retreat south across the Dnipro, or retreat east across the Inhulets and eventually into Kherson city. 

Now as far as I know Ukraine wants to avoid urban warfare, it's messy and costly, so they're unlikely to assault Kherson city directly if they can help it, but what they can do is continue to make resupply difficult, and just... wait.

In that scenario, the Russians in Kherson city are stuck with limited supplies and limited ability to escape. Unless something drastic changes, it would only be a matter of time before they'd be forced to surrender.

Edit: as a TLDR and direct answer to your question, it's not 'doable' right now because to directly assault would be a waste of resources and men, much better to wait and win the fight slowly with much fewer losses.",1665093424.0,1665093171.0,t3_xwvj7l,t1_irc14qn,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

It appears that they are now trying this. It does not seem at all unlikely that they will be able to manage this, as this is by now almost their ""bread and butter"". 

However, Kherson city itself would present an entirely new challenge for the Ukrainian army, as it could devolve into street combat which tends to be very difficult, highly destructive and have a good defenders advantage. Having a lot of Ukrainian citizens in Kherson as well, does not make things easier, as such fighting could lead to a lot of civilian deaths, which the Russians would exploit by taking shelter in populous areas. Advantage of the Ukrainians may be that the Russians won't have a lot ammo and gear due to the logistical difficulties. But it is unknown to what extent that is true, so it's not an advantage you can necessarily ""count"" on.

A lot of people say that the Russians ""are trapped"", but I personally doubt that. To me it seems very likely that the Russians have developed an exit strategy through the use of ferry's/pontoons etc. that they can employ if necessary, while they try to fight an orderly retreat if it comes to that. There's apparently 20-30k Russian troops there, and they **cannot** afford to lose those, so they **must** have devised an exit strategy. 

So it's hard to say how things will progress. Ukraine does seem to find the best strategies and tactics though, and their soldiers appear very motivated. They additionally receive the best possible intelligence from NATO and are helped by NATO war planners to plan and model such offensives.

He also didn’t actually say we’re at the same level of the Cuban Missile Crisis, he said “For the first time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we have a direct threat to the use of nuclear weapons, if in fact things continue down the path they'd been going”- which I think means if things keep escalating we *could* get to the point of a nuclear stand off/war, rather than we’re at that point now.

I feel he is also saying “we are taking this seriously, because we have to”, saying that Putin is a serious guy and you can’t just wave away the threat- and he also mentioned chemical or biological weapons, not just nuclear ones when talking about “he’s not joking.” He’s saying “this man could keep escalating and we have to put our foot down.” As for being concerned about off ramps, he said that a few months ago.

His admin said as recently as a few hours ago “we don’t believe Putin is about to use nukes”, and so (unless they’re lying), if the intel had suddenly changed in between I don’t think Biden would still attending a fundraiser (JFK himself faked an illness during the Cuban crisis to be with his national security team). Plus, the fact he said this at a fundraiser, a month from the midterms, feels like he’s partly using evocative language to that end. If he said this in a press conference or televised speech that really would be alarming.

It’s unnerving, because ofc it is- but I don’t think it’s hugely different to what’s already been said. But the media/social media will run riot with it.",1665109193.0,1665108984.0,t3_xwvj7l,t1_ircucq9,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Tactical nukes can range half to double in yield compared to the two dropped on Japan. 

Warning depends on delivery system and range. Cruise missiles might be detected and shot down since they don't go above the atmosphere. Detection of ballistic missiles depends on the type, which determines how long the warhead is above the atmosphere. Russia would probably use SRBMs or MRBMs. IRBMs and ICBMs give the most warning since they spend the most time in space. 

Detection might also depend on satellite imagery. The US or other NATO satellites might detect the fueling process of some of the shorter ballistic missiles that are launched from vehicles and that could give them some heads up, but ICBMs in silos are shielded from such detection.",False,1665112551.0,t3_xwvj7l,t1_ircxcrw,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Yes, this is a real war with real consequences, and I think everyone who's been following it closely is well aware of that. And Ukrainians living through it are also well aware of it, but in their case they'll be the first to make a meme or find the humor in a situation when it can be found. It's one of the things that's been so remarkable about the Ukrainian information war: they've not just had better communication, but have done it with humor and lightness despite being in the most dire circumstances. It's kept their spirits up while winning them a lot of respect and empathy. They also know when seriousness is needed and change their tone accordingly.

Making comparisons with fictional villains sometimes just fits or makes sense when there's parallels or people are trying to demonstrate the utter ridiculousness or cruelty of the other side.

This sometimes intersects with Matviyenko, but not always.

(Sidenote, Putin has allowed people to oppose this war and keep their positions.  Especially those he previously respected.  But such people know the rules—you can only speak up once, never repeat it bc then trying to persuade rather than say advice, never publicly share, continue to be dedicated to assign tasks, demonstrate loyalty regardless of personal views—this is how Kozak, Naryshkin, Dmitriyev, Mishustin, Sobyanin have stayed alive and in their jobs.  One reporter said that Lavrov dissented prior to war, but I’ve seen no *real* evidence of that.)

2) Matviyenko was head of St Petersburg for a decade.

Exactly! Good way to put it.   One group fires (ie pushes ahead and breaks the enemy line) and as they're reloading (resting/pausing/repairing things, taking a few days rest etc) the next group does the pressing.  

In Kharkiv province they pushed them a LONG ways in a short time and it seems they rolled their forces out - might literally have been 50% in, 50% off - ratio - in comes new fresh troops with brand new everything, well trained in NATO countries.

>Military leaders and senior tsarist officials agreed before the war that Russia was a much stronger nation and had little to fear from the Empire of Japan. The fanatical zeal of the Japanese infantrymen astonished the Russians, who were dismayed by the apathy, backwardness, and defeatism of their own soldiers.[80] The defeats of the Army and Navy shook Russian confidence. Throughout 1905, the Imperial Russian government was rocked by revolution. The population was against escalation of the war. The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, the embarrassing defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular.

1) you can't do referendums during wartime because among a millions reasons its bad most people flee warzones so you cannot conduct elections.

2) Crimea is not a ""mistake"". Crimea has changed hands like 50 times in history. Ukraine's original revolution in 1600s was a Crimean Tatar & Cossack alliance that formed original Ukrainian state. The only reason Crimea is ethnic Russian is genocide. The large Russian minority in Donbas is also genocide (Holodomor). Also Crimea voted to leave Soviet Union in 1991 anyway.

3) Ignored complete momentum shift in recent weeks. There's no reason to negotiate unless you're ahead.

4) You can't have Ukraine sign a peace treaty without security assurances because Russia broke a peace treaty with him by invading. Ukraine has to keep fighting unless they get assurances regardless of other terms.

A neutral peace treaty would've been Zelensky's compromise in March. Crimea status frozen, Donbas back to Feb 2022 lines with referendum in future when IDPs return, security assurances from West in exchange for neutrality.",1665059329.0,1665059113.0,t3_xwvj7l,t1_ir9mjjx,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Nord Stream 2 was already dead, and Russia effectively killed NS1 by turning off the gas.

Germany is spending a massive amount of money to reverse their failed assumptions about the world. They are not going to stay using Russian gas even if it's offered to them for nearly nothing. 

At best, having Nord Stream intact would be a degree of Russian leverage on Germany this winter - ""we could turn the gas back on if only you...."". But Germany was pretty unlikely to capitulate on that to begin with, and by the same time next year there will be far less reason to consider turning it back on with greater alternatives available.

---------

In contrast, while basically nothing changed for Europe from pipeline going from off to broken - it was never expected to be active again, it did a few things for Russia and Putin.

- It's a major threat - if they can blow up Nord Stream without warning, they can likely blow up other non-Russian pipelines that are very important and are supplying Europe.

- For Putin - It closes off one of the more obvious coup avenues. Remove Putin, apologize to Europe, start selling gas to it again is a not entirely unrealistic strategy to take power and save most of the Russian economy.

You get to fix your own demographic problem somewhat and inflict even more pain on a Ukrainian population that has been falling for 30 years. Plus you get to indoctrinate all the little kiddos with propaganda.

And perhaps the darkest part of it is you get to “trade” predominantly minority conscript deaths for ethnically slavic children. Inferior to Russian slavs (of course), but certainly more desirable than Tartars and Caucasian peoples. (/s)

 >Poland partly mobilized its troops on August 24, 1939, and fully mobilized on August 30, 1939, following the increased confrontations with Germany since March 1939. On September 1, 1939 Germany invaded Poland, which prompted both France and Britain to declare war on Germany. However, they were slow to mobilize, and by the time Poland had been overrun by the Axis powers, only minor operations had been carried out by the French at the Saar River. Canada actually carried out a partial mobilization on August 25, 1939, in anticipation of the growing diplomatic crisis.

 >Königsberg (German: [ˈkøːnɪçsbɛʁk] (listen), lit. 'King's mountain') was the historic Prussian city that is now Kaliningrad, Russia. Königsberg was founded in 1255 on the site of the ancient Old Prussian settlement Twangste by the Teutonic Knights during the Northern Crusades, and was named in honour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. A Baltic port city, it successively became the capital of the Królewiec Voivodeship, the State of the Teutonic Order, the Duchy of Prussia and the provinces of East Prussia and Prussia.

'Japanese-Russian War'; Russian: Ру́сско-япóнская войнá, romanized: Rússko-yapónskaya voyná) was fought between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire during 1904 and 1905 over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and the Korean Empire. The major theatres of military operations were located in Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria, and the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean both for its navy and for maritime trade.

Also; test warheads (with dummy materials) are routinely fired, to ensure the mechanism works reliably; excluding the one variable of fissile material. 

It's almost certain that nuclear-aspiring countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia (presently), also have test warhead designs that they test-fire without fissile materials, to ensure that the mechanisms work properly every time. 

This ensures a theoretical confidence that the weapon will work when used.

Parents in occupied areas who are pro-Ukraine do NOT send their children to school.  They’ve either left the region, or they keep their kids at home and do online school.

There are no teachers in occupied regions who work *in school* that are pro-ukraine.  Ukraine pays them 1/3 salary to sit at home.  They can leave area, teach online for fuller salary.  If they go to the schools to teach—they are forced to teach Russian propaganda and they will receive rubles payment—and the laws have been passed they WILL BE CHARGED WITH COLLABORATION. 

You can see my old submitted posts from when I translated this law being enacted, and the big press campaign in all the areas to inform at the end of summer. Also, that Rada has chosen not to charge parents for sending kids to these Russian-controlled schools, but that the data they receive is that there are not pro-Ukrainian families going there anyways.  There’s a plan already being developed for post war—that pro-Russia families will be encouraged to leave for Russian territories, that pediatric psychological support will be needed en masse post war, and that even television accessibility will be needed to change.  The assessments were that in R-occupied areas, only 20% of children remained, and of that 20%, less that 5% was pro-U.  (Not 5% of the original 100%.)

Ukraine has done an extensive campaign (not shown in western press) to assist families in leaving—numbers to call, escorts come and get them, bots, contacts in every local towns office—quite thorough.  If still can’t leave, which sometimes happens, it’s still urged to call to keep contact with pro U reps.  Past this, there’s been a large online education push for those few children who can’t leave.  Ukraine really really does not want to leave children behind.  Bc they endeavor to have to undertake a massive psychological, sociological program anyways for children, they don’t want kids going to these Russian controlled schools.

So any kids going to these schools—who are the ones you reference going to Crimea—almost assuredly have pro Russian parents.  I mean, they are doing Russia’s national anthem multiple times per day!  What antiRussia parent allows that?  They speak in Russian.  Following Russian history.  It’s Russian school.

Now, if you liked to say that taking children from pro-R families is wrong, yes.  *Sending* kids off? Not really.  It’s Eastern European culture to go to these relaxation camps, kids often go on train unaccompanied, so it wouldn’t seem bizarre or amoral in that sense.  But let children go, take kids, when in retreat—that’s wrong.  
But don’t forget that people who are willfully siloed off in their pro Russian information space have created a situation where they’ve closed their ears to the failings of Russia’s military, and that will be abandoned, betrayed by Russia.

Just to give you some background -

The founder of the LDS religion - Joseph Smith - came across some Egyptian papyrus from a traveling salesman and bought them. (Kind of a big thing in the 1840s) This was pre-Rosetta stone (or more accurately, the Rosetta stone had been discovered at this point but hadn't been deciphered) , so we hadn't cracked Egyptian hieroglyphics yet.

Anyway, so Joseph Smith takes these hieroglyphics and claims to be able to translate them (If you read the LDS scripture called Doctrine and Covenants you can actually read his ""translation"") claims it's an account of the prophet Abraham and then spins off an entire book of scripture called the Book of Abraham based off that translation.

Anyway, once the world figured out ancient Egyptian, people could read that papyrus and of course Joseph Smith wasn't even close to being in the same ballpark, let along being in the same state. (If i remember right, the papyrus was just basically a funeral rites passage from the Book of the Dead)

So to combat this, the LDS church stood up FAIR and tried to use scholarly analysis to support the veracity of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants and defend Joseph's supposed revelations. However, when you read FAIR's articles, it comes across as sad denialism of reality and a lot of fudging truth to make it fit the religious doctrine.

There's tons of articles they put out that probably wouldn't make sense to you without an understanding of Mormon theology, but some of them include topics like -

1) If Jews came to North America in 600 B.C., How Come DNA Evidence Doesn't Support That?  
or   
2) The Book of Mormon Speaks Of Horses Pre-Columbian Discovery in North America, How Is That Possible?

The summary of history is that it's complicated and I'd defer to what people actually want now.

And yes obviously Russia stole Crimea as part of a plan to at least annex the east/south Ukraine and capitalize on Ukranian instability caused by Russia to do it.

Putin is like a rabid dog. You can't negotiate, he won't and can't back off and the only thing you can do is your best to keep them from biting and spreading what they're infected with. 

If they launch nukes, they launch nukes. The reality is that Putin is a malignant narcissist who understands that if they do in fact launch nukes, their ability to make further threats, posture and control people with those threats is gone. 

The odds are extremely low that Putin will use nukes. If they do, it's the end of Putin primarily. Putin doesn't want that. Therefore, Putin is not going to use nukes but will not stop threatening to do so as long as people like you are willing to give him presents to stop him from crying like a toddler.",False,1665113263.0,t3_xwvj7l,t1_ird5cxv,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
