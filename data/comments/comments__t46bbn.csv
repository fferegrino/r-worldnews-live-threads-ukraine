>in 2009, the bloc introduced its mutual defence clause, Article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 42.7 obliges EU countries to aid a fellow member state that becomes “the victim of armed aggression on its territory” by “all the means in their power.”

""All means in their power"" is pretty powerful language in terms of compelling union members to military action, so let's end this myth that the EU is a purely economic union once and for all.

Edit: For those interested in reading more about this clause, Politico EU had an article on it a while back:[https://www.politico.eu/article/what-is-article-42-7-of-the-lisbon-french-government-terrorist-attacks-paris-treaty/](https://www.politico.eu/article/what-is-article-42-7-of-the-lisbon-french-government-terrorist-attacks-paris-treaty/)

China regrets deaths in Ukraine but still refuses to acknowledge Russia’s invasion
From CNN's Beijing Bureau 
China said it “regrets"" the casualties in Ukraine and called the current situation ""undesirable"" while continuing to refuse to acknowledge Russia’s military action as “an invasion.”

“The safety of civilians' lives and property should be effectively guaranteed, and in particular, large-scale humanitarian crises should be prevented,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing Tuesday. 

“The present situation is undesirable to us,” Wang said, adding that it is “imperative” for all parties to exercise the “necessary restraint” to prevent an exacerbation of the situation in Ukraine.
However, China continued to dodge questions about calling Russia’s activity in Ukraine an ""invasion,"" instead reiterating that the conflict has a ""complicated history and reality"" and that it supports ""all diplomatic efforts"" to resolve the conflict. 

China ""always advocates a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,"" Wang said, repeating that Russia's ""legitimate demands for security"" should be ""taken seriously and properly addressed.""

When asked whether China would provide supplies to Ukraine, Wang said China is willing to “play a constructive role” in easing the situation in Ukraine and would release relevant information ""in due course.""",False,1646139071.0,t3_t46bbn,t3_t46bbn,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Russia preparing to launch large-scale information operation against Ukraine, says Ukraine's defense minister
From CNN's Olya Voitoych in Kyiv
Russia is preparing to launch a “large-scale information and psychological operation” against Ukraine, Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said Tuesday.

“Its goal is to break the resistance of Ukrainians and the Ukrainian army with lies,” Reznikov said in a statement.

According to the defense minister, Russia has planned to create “communication problems” and to fabricate reports that Ukraine’s military and political leadership have “agreed to surrender” to the Russian Forces.

“As a ‘confirmation’ of this, fake — supposedly signed — documents as well as edited fake videos will be spread,” Reznikov said.

Ukraine push for EU membership 'difficult'

Despite emotional pleas in the European Parliament today, experts say Ukraine's push to be fast-tracked into the EU will be complicated and ""difficult"".      

The unprecedented move started last night with President Zelenskyy signing the official application for Ukraine to be allowed to join the EU.

But now its candidacy needs to be agreed to by all 27 EU members.

Speaking on ABC News Channel, University of Birmingham International Security Professor Stefan Wolff said EU membership was slightly different to NATO membership, which was at the core of Russian President Vladimir Putin's concerns with Ukraine. 

He belived NATO membership was still a very distant prospect for Ukraine.

However, he said EU membership could be more complicated. 

""Even when candidates have agreed, they're moving to what traditionally always has been very long negotiations on individual chapters, where Ukraine has aligned its own regulatory and legal frameworks with those of the EU,"" he said.

""Fast tracking in that sense is going to be very difficult.

""I think the important signal to send now is actually to give you give official candidate status and set the process in motion to get the country eventually join which may still be years ahead even if there is a fast-track process.""",False,1646138700.0,t3_t46bbn,t3_t46bbn,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Putin knows he is running out of time economically. 

The CB closed the stock market for the rest of the week, but you cant keep it closed forever.

In my opinion he is desperate to force a decision now, before the stock opens again.

Thats why he is bombing the cities with everything he has.

Now here is the plot twist: maybe the convoy actually isnt that powerful after all, maybe its sole purpose is to create an atmosphere of inevitability to go into peace talks with leverage. Thats why the convoy is progressing at snails speed -they dont actually want to use this force, its just a mirrage and in those trucks is all kinds of weak, old conscripts and others to prop up the numbers and make it seem like this invincible beast.

Just think about how sudden the talk about the 3 miles long... no 12 miles long... 17 miles... 30 miles... 40 miles long convoy have spread and has everybody worried.

Think about it, before the invasion started, we all looked at the huge number of the russian and automatically assumed that they were powerful - only to find out that a lot of their equipment was old (soviet era) and sub standard, their troops had to scavage for food and some are not even wearing appropriate shoes and they have been taking heavy casualties. 

What if, he is putting all chips down to convince Zelenskyy, that he cant win when in reality Putin is desperately trying to walk away with anything to show for.

As a starting point, its probably worth remembering that for all the bluster Russia really does not want a war with NATO- given the current performance of their military it is pretty clear that 'all out war with NATO' means either a crushing conventional defeat or shared nuclear annihilation.

Secondly the West is already doing some extremely provocative things. Make no mistake, the stingers and guided anti tank missiles being rushed across the border into a war zone are directly intended to kill russian soldiers and are probably more likely to kill larger numbers of them than a no fly zone - you're talking about some fighter pilots needing to bail out versus APCs full of soldiers being incinerated by javelins and nlaws. 

Similarly, the actions against Russia's banking system are directly intended to tank their economy, make life miserable for ordinary people and cause domestic unrest and potentially cause regime change. If Russia was looking for an excuse to go to war with NATO, its already there- but they haven't, because annexing Ukraine, whilst important, isn't worth doing something that would rapidly cause the destruction of their entire military and leave them with no real choice except a nuclear exchange- you don't destroy your country to try to take some extra territory.

So all the talk about war with NATO is exactly that- talk, to try to encourage NATO to not aid Ukraine. If they were willing to go to war with NATO the justification already exists. But they're not. Because they can't, because they know perfectly well all their military is really good for is making war on women, children and elderly people hiding in their apartments in Kharkov.

With that in mind the best way of bringing this crisis to a conclusion is to do absolutely everything humanly possible, short of 'official' NATO involvement to aid Ukraine in defeating russia and bringing this invasion to an end, and forcing them into a face saving agreement at the negotiating table. Lease Ukraine fighter jets and pilots,  deliver an unlimited supply of tomahawk missiles to Lviv, donate F15E eagles with NATO 'instructor' pilots and ukrainian weapons officers, paint ukrainian flags on F35s and A10s and offer their crews ukrainian citizenship and 7 digit private military contractor jobs, hell lease them air bases in poland and squadrons of reaper drones, do everything humanly possible to help them crush the invasion - and the Russians won't do shit. Because fundamentally, if they'd like themselves and the world to continue to exist there is absolutely nothing they can do about NATO helping Ukraine. 

They might bluster and threaten but as long as there is a convenient fiction available for the russians to pretend it is Ukrainians and not NATO, they'll take that out, because really, what is the alternative for them?

For quite a while now, Putin has assumed that the word 'nuclear' is a magical password that gets the West to do whatever he wants- hell last week he thought a fictitious ""high alert' would prevent sanctions. But for the last 40 years of the cold war the West saw off a succession of tinpot soviet dictators just as stupid and evil as putin with the simple position that they can have their nuclear war whenever they like, just so long as they are clear that they, their families, their loved ones, and literally everyone and everything they've ever cared about are going to end up dead as well. That was the position in 1965 and its still the position now, and its actually been remarkably effective at keeping everyones' fingers away from the red buttons.",1646141857.0,1646137908.0,t3_t46bbn,t3_t46bbn,,0,81,0,81,1,0,

* Ukraine is too busy fighting to put much thought into propaganda
* Russia is much larger and has more government outside of a combat area right now, obviously.
* Russia is pretty much *solely renowned* for their disinformation campaigns. It's their second largest export.
* Russia has been extremely unreliable this entire time
* Russia has more to gain by lying
* Even if you're right about a Ukrainian story being false, the best case scenario for you is that you just helped neutralize propaganda that was valuable to Ukraine.
* Being correct in this situation, even aside from potentially aiding Russia, serves no other purpose than being correct.
* Has Russia even admitted casualties yet?

European Union (EU) - **This is primarily an Economic Union/trading bloc.** Formed for the purposes of free movement of labour and capital between borders of its member nations, which coordinate economic policies, laws, and regulations to address economic and financial issues. As the name suggests, it’s membership is limited to European states only.

UN - An international intergovernmental organisation whose members consist of almost all the countries in the world. The objective of this organisation is to promote world peace, and general harmony amongst its members. Therefore think of it like a **global peace keeping Corp**

NATO - this is a **inter-governmental military alliance** between select North American and European states. Was founded on the principle of mutual defence and security (or “attack on one of us is considered as an attack on all of us”). 

Sorry for my poor English guys, it isn’t my first language

Edit: Some of you have rightly pointed out that the EU treaty has a mutual defence clause. Thank you for that. However, the main purpose of the EU is to facilitate ease of trade between its members, and that’s what differentiates it from alliances like NATO which are wholly formed for military purposes.

A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.
Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, Putin said
Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.
The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum. And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to fight for it with the Atlantic bloc.

Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations
Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.
And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.
Russian-Ukrainian negotiations - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022
Yesterday, 18:25
Russia formed a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine
Did anyone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools.
More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.
Deputy head of administration

Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022
Yesterday, 18:23
Russia agreed to Ukraine to organize negotiations, Peskov said
Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.
Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.
Flags of the European Union in the building of the Council of Europe in Brussels - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022
Yesterday, 19:16
Russia's rights in the Council of Europe suspended
But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chances of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China. If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.
Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

""The Russian constitution gives the president control over nuclear weapons, but the transmission of any order to use them, and the authentification of that order, also involve the defence minister and the armed forces' chief-of-staff.

How such a scenario would play out exactly ""we don't know"", said Pavel Podvig, a Russian independent military expert.

The two subordinates have ""no right to veto, but there is still some kind of deliberation process,"" he said, adding: ""It's not like there is a button on the president's table, there is a procedure.""

Even if a nuclear strike order should come down, there is still the question of whether the armed forces would comply.

""They are not mad and they are not sectarians,"" said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert based in Moscow at Riddle, a think tank.

As an expat myself, I feel really sorry for the Russians expats who are against this war, they're probably having it rough right now, especially in the US.  
Story Time, if someone is bored and want to read it:  
Back in 2016 I and 3 friends did a road trip from Coast to Coast in the US. Starting from Miami we drove overnight and arrived in New Orleans early next morning, we were hungry and there weren't many places open so when we saw a KFC just opening we stopped there to eat. One of my friends collects sports jerseys, and on the occasion he was, coincidentally, wearing the Ukraine's national team jersey. While we were eating, another guy came in, ordered something and sat there to eat as well. Then he heard us talking in a different language and came to our table, it went like that:  


  
He: Are you guys fucking Russians?!  


Friend: No, we are not  


He: Why the hell are you speaking Russian then?!  


Friend: We are not, it doesn't even sound like Russian, bro!  


He: So why is he wearing a fucking tee with Russian writing then?!  


Friend: It's not Russian, it's Ukrainian, look at the colors, it's yellow and blue, Russia is blue, red and white!  


He: You sure about that? Why you wearing that shit anyway? You're in America!  


Friend: It was a gift, it's from a soccer team, I collect jerseys and didn't know it was a bad idea to wear it here in America.  


He: Ok then, but you should take it off soon, we don't like Russians here and the next guy might not be as nice as I am and ask before beating that shit out of you.  


Friend: Thanks for the tip, bro, I'll change it after I'm done eating.  
We managed to keep it cool, but it was pretty scary. We were 3 guys and one girl, but the guy was much taller and stronger than us, plus we didn't know if had a gun or knife so played it nice because we didn't want to upset him and risk it.  
My friend of course took it off as soon as we got back to the car and never wore it again during the next 25 days we stayed in America. I don't know if this guy was just an asshole, if this was a ""gang thing"" or if people there really don't like Russians, but if they go through something similar often, I feel sorry for them, must be tough.

Response to some previous comments:  


\- We didn't get a bad view from the whole country after that. We drove over 10k miles, passed through over 50 cities and over 15 states in total, this was our only negative experience. The rest of trip was a breeze and people were super friendly so we assumed this was an isolated case, either the person being an asshole or something specific to that region. We also know that there are stupid people everywhere in the world, so we definitively don't lump all the Americans with that guy.  


\- We were fine, my friend was a bit shaken for the next 2-3 days but eventually got over it. He did buy ""neutral"" clothes though, he had only sports jerseys with him and though it was better not to risk it again.  


\- Talking to that friend right now, he just reminded me that we had a bad experience overall with that place. We were the first customers of the day and the girl seemed were very upset about this, she wasn't nice at all. She kept rambling something about people being clueless and that they were not ready to take orders yet. I just checked and I gave them a 1\* review on Google Maps for that reason, so maybe that area of the city in general is not so nice? The address is 3663 General De Gaulle Dr, New Orleans, in case someone is wondering. Just keep in mind that this happened 6 years ago, so maybe things changed now.",False,1646137559.0,t3_t46bbn,t3_t46bbn,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

As a counter-point to those saying Putin should pull a Hitler, I'd argue that we absolutely want to leave the opportunity open for Putin to walk back his invasion and (ostensibly) save face.

First off, it's the ""Devil You Know"" principle.

Second, the primary objective (and most pressing) is an end to the death and destruction happening to the Ukrainian people. If Putin is the one to it with a call to end the war, so be it. 

Putin will not launch nukes. He could, though, pressure his military leaders to go ""scorched Earth"" in Ukraine, regardless of the outcome. Such measures would be easier for Putin, as he can rely on personal relationships and play off of internal power dynamics to work around official channels.

Finally, if Putin survives this, there will be consequences for him. But ideally, they would come from within Russia. I don't think the West wants to come across as having toppled the Putin regime and installed their own puppet government in Russia.

Without a doubt there's no moral justification for the russian invasion. ""I feel encircled by NATO"" is not a reason. 

Having said that: No, it's not a good idea to wish for a no-fly zone. Yes, ultimately, the West will let Putin have substantial parts or substantial say in the Ukraine and will not do much more than it is doing now. 

The surprising fact that this invasion hasn't yet been finished is less a sign of ""Russia army shit, we don't need to fear it"" and more of a ""Russian generals completely miscalculated the situation"" and the situation is not one where you can let the russian army do what it can do best which is wholesale destruction. 

That Putin attacked Ukraine might indeed be a sign that he already felt substantially threatened (either that or he felt the west is substantially weak, most probably a mix of the two) that he ordered this attack. 

Unless the West gives him a way out he has basically no choice than to complete this occupation and that's exactly what will happen. He doesn't seem completely rational anymore and in such a situation you may want to think thoroughly before you randomly push him further. 

When I read the positive comments regarding an alleged Polish decision to cut all diplomatic ties with Russia.

You can't not talk to a power capable of deleting us all itself. (but well, Poland's got history too, I know).

Economic war,

Cyber warfare,

Multiple parties in conflicts around the globe declaring support  for Russia,

Semi naval blockade is starting to form (shipping companies are jumping ship (hehe) )

Taiwan-China is getting very hot as well, as the US is now detemrined to net let what happened to Ukraine and it separatist regions and Russia, happen to Taiwan

Massive amounts of volunteers from allied countries going to fight the ideological foe.

I mean, nobody in history ever ""declared world war"" against another country, it's just a retrospective assessment of historians later on.

He’s slowly upping the ante. Killing more and more people, bombarding with increased frequency civilian population. He’s not looking to break the Ukrainians, he’s looking to break us. To make us give up the last 30 years of security in exchange of the lives of the Ukrainians.

The news on SBS wasn’t enough. So I hit Twitter and Reddit. An IT friend said “follow this account”. I did. They were posting footage with a Telegram watermark.  So I installed Telegram and followed.

I want to barrack for the Blue and Yellow. I want the underdogs to win. I want the bad guys to be humiliated. 

I found a cache. A whistle blower account keeps a list of Telegram channels. And here it is. Raw footage. Unexploded missiles buried deep in the footpath. Hold my camera while we take a selfie.
Supermarkets, shelters, drone footage, upturned tanks, broken bridges, laughing soldiers, speeches. 

I don’t read Russian well enough to know when it’s Ukrainian. I don’t know the acronyms. I don’t know why some tanks have Z and some have V. I don’t know what an NLAW is. But I’m learning.

Why is this man glad wrapped to a lamp post? The yellow stripes on these white vans full of green boxes - good guys, killed trying to re-arm? - saboteurs caught in the act? Eight vans is a lot.

Then I find the grey channel. It’s not one you can join (follow, subscribe) You have to use the link each time. Some sort of burner channel. Lots of speeches from people I don’t recognise yet. And these two videos. Many videos. But these two.

The first video is dash cam. No wait it’s hand held. Passenger side looking ahead into poor resolution (smoke? haze? fog?) down a country road. Male voices. I only know a few of the words. “There!”
Bright flashes ahead and the crunch of bullets into the car “Go Go” a dog whines in urgent pain. The car does not move. 
The passenger shoves open the side door and rushes out behind the car crouching low. The number plate has fallen off with bullet holes and lies on the ground.
The passenger creeps around the car. 
The driver is lying on his back in the middle of the road. Blood and glass. The passenger shouts “Papa!”. The driver grunts, says something and sits up. The son shouts to him and he says something back. “That’s all”. Bullets thunk into the road around him he falls back.
The camera no longer points at anything rational. The ground. A tyre. A boot. A few moments pass, and the passenger scrambles to pull the old driver behind the car. The passenger is screaming and sobbing. “Papa” and “Please” are the only words I recognise.
The passenger drags his father to the edge of the road shielded by the car.
A dog walks past.
Limping.

The second video looks like one I have seen many times now. No haze, clear afternoon light, steady hand, the camera phone approaches the back of a car shot up by a country road. “The aftermath”. The number plate is on the ground. Bullet holes in the back. It’s this car, but not this camera. The camera circles the car. Dead German Shepherd hanging half out. Driver’s side windscreen full of bullet holes. Bloody drag trail going behind the car. The camera walks to the ditch at the side of the road. A tangle of limbs, two bodies. The dad’s orange scarf.
The other dog sitting with them looks at the camera, looks at the dead son, resumes licking its injured leg.",False,1646136802.0,t3_t46bbn,t3_t46bbn,,0,-16,0,-16,0,0,

Their military doctrine probably doesn't account for economic warfare of this sort, and it also acknowledges that they've fought proxy wars of their own. Equipment supply isn't considered an act of war since it undoes their entire narrative.

If we make a direct, physical attack, their military doctrine is to respond with violence. What the violence might be isn't really the question. The strategic arsenal probably isn't really on the table and wouldn't even be then either. The question is how long that violence lasts and how far it spreads. The question is China's response. The question is India's response. India has one of the largest militaries in the world, remember.

There's a larger scope to this than just 'attack the Russkies in Ukraine and it all goes away, they won't do nothin' because they can't do nothin'.'

I agree that Russia has nothing to gain from further escalation or using nuclear weapons.The only thing that worries me is that a situation might arise where Putin is unable to get out of this without saving face and while Russia (as a country) has nothing to gain from escalation, he might feel that he (personally) has nothing to lose by trying to force a somewhat beneficial outcome for him personally. I know nothing about Russias nuclear protocols, but in the US for instance it is INSANE how a very few individuals have basically full access and can make a decision to launch individualy. 
I do not think putin invaded Ukraine to snatch territory, i think he invaded because he geniuinely feels his regime (note that i say his regime and not Russia as a country) is threatened by Ukraine moving towards a more democratic and less corrupt way of government. Providing a (better) alternative to Putins reign to the russian People, very close (both in distance and in shared history) to Russia. So far his war has only worked contrary to that goal, uniting the west and pushing Ukraine more towards it.

(In my experience, there's just as many racists in the North, they just keep their mouth shut until they know everyone around them feels the same way.)

I find your story odd in particular because I've never really encountered anyone who would get riled up about someone wearing something with ""Russian"" words on it - certainly not what is clearly a sports jersey.  As for speaking 'Russian', it's not that you were speaking 'Russian', it's that you weren't speaking English.  The same type of person that this guy proved himself to be is the same person who will yell at two people from South America who are conversing between themselves in Spanish. ""This is America, speak English"" is a common thing these mouth-breathers will say.  They're in the minority, but because they make a bunch of noise it seems like there's more of them than there are.  They're paranoid and probably think that because they can't understand what you're saying, you must be saying nasty things about them.

As for the KFC employee - that's not surprising.  You were dealing with a low-wage person at the opening shift, and since they don't serve breakfast, it's probably uncommon for them to have many customers at 10am (looks like when that location opens).  I've found that the attitude of fast food employees is tied to how populated an area is.  Big city, high traffic?  They're just trying to keep up and don't have time for anyone's shit.  Suburban areas?  Hit or miss - you might find a few pleasant employees depending on the location, type of restaurant, and what management looks for when hiring employees.  Out in the country or small town?   Probably quite pleasant because traffic is low and there's a higher chance they know most of their customers.

I'm just a single data point but in my experience, Americans generally may have a bad perception of a country, but don't attribute that to citizens of that country.  Many might not like Russia or China, but still think the average citizen from those countries are good people trying to get through life like us.

This war would realistically always consist of two parts: the invasion and the occupation. The invasion is really supposed to be the easy part, it's with a drawn out occupation the real challenges start for Russia. We know for a fact that Putin's original plan was to take Kyiv within the first 48 hours of the invasion and install a puppet government within the first 72 hours. He has failed to meet all deadlines, meaning he is currently bleeding houndreds of millions of dollars every day. We're 6 days into a 3 day invasion (which, remember, is supposed to be the easy part).   


Therefor, the numbers don't really matter (that is, military numbers anyhow). Even if Russia sends 10000 tanks and 200.000 men to take over every city, village and town in Ukraine, the Russian economy is tanked to the point where sustaining any meaningful occupation of Ukraine is impossible. The Ukrainian people is hardly gonna throw their hands in the air and accept defeat and embrace their new puppet government. There will be guerilla warfare, bombings, and continued resistance against any occupying force. And Russia simply doesn't have the economical or logistical ability to keep such an occupation going. (Unless every Russian soldier suddenly accepts to work for free with little food and safety).   


Obviously, Russia has the numerical superiority, but if they're not able to properly establish effective supply lines soon, those numbers could become a liability. The more tanks you have, the more fuel you need. The more men you have, the more food you need. If they fail to secure those supply lines (or if Ukraine can manage to cut them off at chokepoints/bottlenecks), their numbers will become a weakness. (There have been reports of vechicles being abandoned due to running out of fuel ever since the invasion started).  


So trying to be as unbiased as possible, my amateur estimate would be that the chances of Russia killing the Ukrainian government and taking most major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, is still fairly likely. The idea of Ukraine holding the Russian forces off long enough that Russia has no option but to retreat due to lack of resources and money, while not impossible, is highly unlikely.

While Russia would have nothing to gain by deploying nukes as a response to a NATO defense of Ukraine.. the treat to do so is a deterrent. Whether they go through with it or not is depends largely on putan's mental state, and I am not qualified to correctly evaluate that.

I also think it depends on the exact manner the defense is executed in, how badly Russia is doing in the fight, and the effect of sanctions.

If NATO rolled in at the very start, I think it was more likely to cause a nuclear response. If NATO rolls in now, or in a few days; gives plenty of notice; and simultaneously extends an end to sanctions if Russia just retreats... well maybe that gives putan an out for a costly and losing war.

Chinese shipping company rates will rise significantly, specifically for Russia, while the impact to the West will be negligible. China wants to keep trading with the west and needs to stay competitive with western carriers.

China will certainly fill some of this gap, but the rates will still be astronomical for Russia compared to what they were two weeks ago.

I can't speak on whether or not China will supply Russia overland, but that too will be affected due to a finite amount of containers, which the shipping companies also own.

How many checks and balances does Putin have if his mental health deteriorates to the extent where he decides on a total war-scenario to save his face and honor?

I guess my response to that is if we really are faced with the nightmare scenario of a fundamentally irrational person with access to a world ending nuclear arsenal, well we most likely can't do a damn thing about that, we're  fucked and all we can hope for are his choices are so clearly irrational that regime change happens before he dooms everyone.

That said, i don't think Putin has done anything actually downright insane these last few months- he's just made a series of very bad miscalculations about Russia's military capability, Ukraine's will to fight and the West's capacity to unify in the face of a clear threat which are actually pretty understandable when you look at how frequently he's gotten away with this sort of thing in the past.

A 40 mile convoy with a couple hundred feet between vehicles would be about 10,000 vehicles long. Even if they threw everything at Kyev this would be an extraordinary long ass convoy. The longest in the world. 

If it does stretch for 40 miles that means between groups there are several miles between them. Meaning the convoy is actually a lot easier to take on due to the distance between troops. Just ambush the first group and wait an hour for the next to arrive while you result and smoke and do whatever.

Edit to clean up sentence

Edit 2: we are also talking over 250,000 troops if we assume there are twelve men with each vehicle/equipment including the driver. Russia is said to only have 150,000 at the border and in Ukraine. They already have troops all over. So unless they sent this convoy with 2 people with each vehicle there is no way this is as big as it sounds. Might stretch for forty miles but would mean huge gaps between the troop. 

Originally the convoy was 3 miles long and that seems more plausible. 600 or so vehicles, 7,000 troops, a couple hundred equipment. That’s massive as well but more realistic.",1646139290.0,1646138877.0,t3_t46bbn,t1_hywle1d,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Ma added that the U.S. could also incur major costs in the future providing economic and humanitarian aid to allies, and that Europe could be destabilized by large numbers of fleeing Ukrainians.  
  
“If the Ukraine refugee crisis is not properly handled, this will be conducive for Russia to sow hatred and sabotage NATO,” Ma wrote. “The fierce debate on refugee problems inside Europe could also damage its unity at crucial moments.”  


Still, China could provide some support for Russia to keep the punishments from biting too hard. Chinese companies are expected to scoop up discounted Russian oil if sanctions deter other buyers, traders have said. It could also provide a financial lifeline because the People’s Bank of China has a multi-billion dollar currency swap with its counterpart in Moscow, allowing the nations to provide liquidity to businesses so they can continue trading.

Gotta say, imo, most people appear to have a very short attention span and curiosity limit, especially as it comes to not-in-my-neighborhood items.

A lot of people would say that they ""can understand multiple things to be true at once"", yet they severely de-prioritize items that aren't in their direct attention center and almost completely detach from history or trend data.

I would consider the above to be the ""norm"", or the ""standard human"" pattern of behavior.

Perusing your comment history, you seem to fall into the same standard category yourself (imo).

That's actually a remarkably amateurish read on the situation, typical of not-so-smart redditors (most of them) who have no understanding of the situation and can't form an opinion with any substance more than ""Putin bad, West good"". 

NATO has expanded readily over the years towards Russia, posing an existential threat. Great powers do not tolerate other great powers expanding towards their region of influence (see U.S and the monroe doctrine). NATO is a military alliance led by a rival superpower, its expansion towards Russia is the textbook definition of an existential threat.

A power grab is an attempt to grab power in an opportunistic manner. If you paid attention to European politics (obvious you haven't), you'd know that since the Bucharest Summit of '08 in which Ukraine announced its aspiration to join NATO, Russia has done everything to warn NATO against further expansion, especially with respect to Ukraine.

To adapt the Euro (which is mandatory for new members) they need to reduce that. To do that they would need to cut government spending to large degrees as growing their economy to decrease their deficit would take years without an active war. But cutting government spending and fortifying their economy is also not realistic under current circumstances.

Entering the eurozone and collective market with a deficit exceeding 3% would mean overnight that they'd have trouble paying their existing debts, closing new loans and would make importing goods more expensive. They'd struggle competing with other EU states on the market so lose out on industrial and economical growth increasing their existing (by that point) economical problems and making it harder to get on equal level.

For the EU entering Ukraine this way would almost immediately devalue the Euro, while also obligating the EU to subsidize Ukraine's economy to stay afloat as Ukraine defaulting would likely plunge the EU entirely into economic disaster.

Anything that dragged the EU and US in either via NATO or independently with their associated allies would immediately be known to be major war.  Add in possiblity of China joining on either side and the media would (distinct possibility given some publications and outlets behaviour) preempt the historians before the declarations even finished being announced.

I hope this clarifies what I was trying to get across earlier but failed too.  Thanks for pointing it out to me.

Most convoys use 100 vehicles. Also where are 250,000 troops supposed to get food? Assuming they are moving 5,000+ vehicles, where is the fuel being carried?  They are theoretically traveling hundreds of miles. Assuming they do set aside hundreds of trucks just for food, what happens when they run out? 

If it were stretching out 40 miles then that means for every one or two groups there is five or so miles between them. Especially considering the convoy originally was 3 miles long. 

If we shoot down the front groups then the next group won’t be there until after an hour or so. Plenty of time for Russians to move the vehicles if they continue advancing. Now if we completely wipe out that front group with no communication from them and clearly visible signs of an attack the following groups would see the attack and send a warning down the line.

I'm sorry to burst Reddit's bubble, but there were genuine reasons for Russia to be concerned with the situation in the Donbas. It may have actually been in everyone's interest (include Ukraine's) for the Donbas region to have been recognised as a neutral independent state in exchange for Ukraine being allowed to join the EU. There were likely workable solutions to this conflict but from the West's perspective Russia is always bad so we refused to understand their concerns and negotiate reasonably which made the only option war.

And this would have been bad enough, but now we're escalating the problem more and as you point out most of Reddit and Western media actually seems to be in favour of this escalation. Unfortunately the only option is going to be WW3 if we carry on in this direction, there is no alternative. It's like when siblings want to play with the same toy, they either fight over it or find some compromise. There isn't an alternative where both can get their way. So like literal children the West and Russia now needs to decide between compromise or violence, and right now we're doing the opposite of compromising because of immature political divisions.

Another dangerous illusion I've seen a lot of people operating on here is that NATO would win WW3. And while NATO might technically win a war with Russia you would have to accept that any war would come at the cost of hundreds of millions dying and the likely use of biological and chemical weapons on civilian populations -- and this is on top of the nuclear weapons used (some of which are likely be dirty).

The consequences for humanity here are so extreme it makes what's happening in Ukraine look entirely insignificant. Yes, Putin was wrong to invade, but unless we can negotiate hundreds of millions will die. This isn't some video game. We need to demand our governments stop escalating tensions and start acting like adults and talk to each other.

I'd work on the opposite assumption that war between Russia and NATO basically means mass, nuclear, biological and chemical warfare being deployed against the US and allies.

Obviously assuming one isn’t used right next to Chernobyl, the fallout would be relatively insignificant, as most nukes aren’t designed to spread fallout rather than use that energy is in the blast. I believe the wind typically blows to the east, so as long as NATO countries are mostly unaffected, they would probably opt to not end the world in nuclear fire. No one can really know for sure how the situation would play out as there isn’t really any precedent. The point of my initial reply was to combat the fear of nuclear annihilation in this thread.

The general defensive/territorial posture and army set-up was a result of this. Sure they have capabilities in that regard and have had a couple of small scale offensive operations since WW2, but overall they haven't really progressed from the defence in depth conventional approach to the army which they have held since pre-WW2.
Even the offensives during WWII followed the basic approach of letting the enemy exhaust themselves and then rolling them back with simple overwhelming manpower and resources. 

To change that approach was the goal of the army reforms Putin implemented since the mid 2000s, but it seems they didn't go too well.

That does not mean we should not help these countries in place, and partner with and invest in these countries, as far as is possble. Northern Africa could and should become an energy partner for Europe in the future, and so on. We should hope they develop stable, open societies in their own countries, that we are strong partners with. But in the current state of the world, we cannot risk the future of Europe with unfettered immigration and ghettoization (look at Sweden).

Security wise, I have shifted to the right, too. Europe needs a strong federal state with a strong federal army, and somehow Russia needs to be overcome as a geopolitical threat. No idea how, apart from hoping the Russians rise and get rid of Putin. We need to stop trusting that other actors are always benign and automatically headed on the path of liberal democracy. Many aren't.

But also some economic aspects. I believe in a Nordic style model with unions (preferably backed by large scale collective agreements for sectors) and support of workers with good healthcare, support for new parents etc. I also believe we should bring industry back to Europe. But I do think free market methods and corporations (properly regulated) are the better alternative in almost every case. However, corporations should not be allowed again to do what happened with giving China all of the worlds manufacturing power. 

I also do not believe in the kind of welfare we see where governments just unconditionally and endlessly shovel money at segments of the population who are structurally in a position to never work and contribute. I believe work and schooling should be absolutely made available to them, but anyone who behaves anti-socially and is found to waste government time should be cut off. Constantly treating people with kid gloves actually harms them.

I also do not believe in the modern attitude that people should get government support to study useless subjects at university. I believe all the money and time invested in students should go toward them actually contributing by studying subjects that are important (and I dont just mean money making, cultural and societal contributions are good too). But we do have a large amount of waste in the universities, not just of money but of years of the lives of young people. Some of this ""freedom of choice"" is harming young people by fooling them into wasting years on subjects that do them no good.",1646141745.0,1646141455.0,t3_t46bbn,t1_hywow5y,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
