d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,122af4v,jdtuxmi,"Here's why I believe Ukraine was, and remains, such a threat to Vladimir Putin: In 1989, Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden when the Berlin Wall fell and communism collapsed. How did that collapse happen? East Germans who were (illegally) watching West German TV saw that their neighbors to the West had a life, and lifestyle, far superior to the one in East Germany. More freedom. More income. More opportunities. Better quality of life. So, East Germans voted with their feet and fled. Putin soon experienced the collapse of East German firsthand.

Today, Putin's worst nightmare is a Ukraine that holds free and fair elections, and has a free media, human rights, freedom of speech and religion. Ukraine, Russia's neighbor, already has a higher standard of living than Russia. Ukraine has not yet reached its potential, but unlike Russia, they've already made some significant strides in that direction. (Compare the respective trajectories of North and South Korea since 1970 if you want to see a historical precedent.) 

A successful Ukraine is simply a ticking time bomb for an autocratic revanchist Tsar in the Kremlin, plain and simple. So yes, you could say that Ukraine was an existential threat to Putin's kleptocratic regime. But not for the absurd reasons the Kremlin has claimed.

 Today there was a meeting with the military - a special military meeting, a special circle of participants. He also held meetings with the security sector and intelligence. Defense, strengthening of our defense - both from external threats and from internal threats. Preparing our respective steps.

Constantly, invariably, maximum attention is given to situations on the front line. The brutal battles that take the lives of our people every day and require constant mobilization of our state and society every day. It's wrong, it's unfair - when our soldiers who come from the front have the feeling that the war has already ended for many in the rear. For those who are not just far from Donetsk region or Nikopol, from Saltivka, from the border regions of Sumy region, from Zaporizhzhia... And who are mentally far from the trenches, from the daily pain of Ukrainians.

Now, as well as a year ago, one cannot be mentally far from the war, although thanks to our soldiers, the actual combat operations are really geographically far from many. Now, just as it was a year ago, it is important that as many Ukrainians as possible help the defense of the state, help the accumulation of world support for our victory.

Dear Ukrainians! Support our fighters whenever possible. Don't forget about volunteer meetings - and join when you can. It is very important that everyone who has informational influence participate in informational work. This applies not only to journalists, but to everyone who can spread the truth about aggression. The strength of Ukraine is the strength of all those who fight for Ukraine and who help the fighters.

Glory to all our soldiers who are in battle! Thanks to everyone who helps the defense!

1. OOCL (chinas largest shipper) just announced that they will no longer ship containers to russia.


2. china has barred the servicing of commercial aircraft in china.

3. china has banned russian credit cards in china

4. china has refused to send dual use machine tools to russia.

5. the only weapons that have been sent are 1000 semi auto AR15 nock offs that are not good at all.

6. china has blocked north korea from sending arms to russia

7.  china has undercut russian arms sales by going after former russian customers and offering china versions of the same systems.

8. china has had a major meeting with the leaders of all the stans. and didnt invite russia.

9.  china is (from reports) selling russia and ukraine about the same amount of uniforms and boots, at the same time, and loading them on aircraft at the same time on the same taxiway.

10. china has sold far more drone components to ukraine than to russia

11.  the last few long range drone attacs were made by china made drones.

so please keep talking about china. 

unless something BIG changes, china is only out to make money.

But that tweet is a bit misleading.  They weren’t exactly being prepared, more like an informational session of the what would be needed if the situation happens in the future.  Kherson had multiple such meetings before evacuating—so this was likely the first in probably 5+ such meetings.

The reason this landed with such a splash is because the city has—from the point of view of these collaborators—fully integrated into Russia.  They really think they’re Russia now.  And there’s been no public discussions there around Melitopol between Russians and collaborators that Ukraine would retake Melitopol.  It was a shock to those traitors that such was on the menu.  And of course, that they were to leave their keys behind, lol—can you imagine?  They’ve betrayed their country, given posts of power in the Russian-occupied Melitopol, believe that they’re now mini-authorities in the ‘strongest’ European nation...and are now being told they they aren’t sitting pretty, that they need to be prepared to leave with just hours notice, and that they will have to forego the property rights/equity in/access to their home that they spent life savings in, and will instead become powerless, lowly refugees with no ownership in anything, can only have one vehicle between them and adult relatives, and the evacuation route isn’t even set yet but likely Crimea, then Russia.  These traitors didn’t want to be lowly nobodies in Russia.  They wanted to be big fish in their own pond.  And now that propaganda bubble of Russian media they’re ingesting has been popped and they realized they don’t live in a secure Russia, that they’re in Ukraine, and they aided the enemy.  They’re said to be “in a panic, in hysterics.”

Edit: looking at your source, Federov got the information *from* the same source that I have linked—an article by the pro-Ukrainian *regional* publication, *Ria-Melitopol*, which is mainly for Melitopol but covers southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, as well.  Mayor Federov and *Ria-M* are considered the two definitive sources on what is happening there—they often quote each other, even.  After *Ria-M* published the article on the meeting and ensuing ‘panic’, including frantic communications between collaborators and occupiers, Mayor Federov repeated the main points of this credible source on the ‘national telethon’ [live *national* broadcast, coordinated by all the tv news channels], although without the details—which is what the Study of War was referencing.",1679864851.0,1679862419.0,t3_122af4v,t1_jdrwz9i,,1,44,0,44,1,0,

The only scenario in which China's aid to Russia would pay off would be if Russia decisively wins in Ukraine and the entire NATO and EU emerge extremely weakened. For that to be even remotely realistic, China would have to go all out and shower Russia with all manner of weapons, vehicles, and supplies.

A China that takes such an open stance would undoubtedly draw the wrath of the West and a trade war would ensue, with sanctions and blockades. The economic damage to the entire world would be devastating.

China should be very sure that Russia, with Chinas support, will then win in any case and that the West will be so severely weakened in the end (EU and NATO breaking apart etc.) that China, with a grateful Russian Empire at its side, dominates everything.

But I don't think China would put everything on one card like that. It could easily either backfire or escalate into a world war.

Tear gas CAN be used in VERY specific situations and the problem for any user is that it's very easy to accidentally put yourself into a situation where you've used it illegally.

Specifically, teargas can be used for dispersion but NOT in any way that gives you a tactical advantage. What's the difference?

Let's say you are defending a base and for reasons 3/4 sides are nicely defended but one side has a giant gaping hole in it. The advancing opponent obviously wants to attack there. If you gas the hole and they retreat, you're good.

BUT!

If you gas the hole and the opposing men stumble forward blindly through it anyway and into your gunfire, or they stumble out towards the sides (and into the stronger fields of fire), now you've got yourself a trip before the Hague as a war criminal because you gained a tactical advantage.

Even more, this is treated so seriously that secondary effects are considered. If you preemptively gas the hole before anyone gets there with the intention of ""They can't make it through, and they won't be stupid enough to attack the other directions, so they'll withdraw."", you are still guilty of a war crime if for reasons beyond your control the opposing commander decides he HAS to attack anyway and attacks one of your flanks.

I believe—and I haven’t seen this written by experts but surely it has been—this is done in order to ensure Belarus stays in the Russian sphere of influence post-Lukashenko, and possibly even becomes part of Russia post-Lukashenko.

Say Lukashenko has a stroke in 18months, Russia has moved nukes there, an interim leader is care-taking rest of term—will Russia just sit quietly by while Belarus prepares a free & fair election? 

Would Russia want Belarus to have nukes if there’s a 1% chance that a democracy-leaning politician would be elected?  What if the chance is 25%?  What if it’s 75% chance a democratic politician is about to be elected?  What if that politician were to cancel military agreements with Russia, and instead made friendly gestures to its neighbors?  Surely, Russia intends to control Belarus post-Lukashenko, and this is *one* of the methods—they’re creating what would be a crisis—“neighbors have nukes! Our nukes!”—in order to have an excuse later to seize/maintain control. 

I’ve had the impression for a while that Russia will “let” Lukashenko be in power for as long as Lukashenko wants; and afterwards, Russia does not intend to “let” there be a free election, but intends instead to either (1) seize control, (2) install a puppet in fake election, (3) foment unrest followed by seizing control, or (4) foment unrest followed by installing a puppet. 

Their excuse post-Lukashenko for seizing or installing puppet will be various iterations of (a) international agreements made with Lukashenko must be upheld, (b) Russia’s national security, (c) the west is meddling, (d) anyone who wants democracy is a foreign agent, (e) Belarusians really want to be Russian, (f) Russia is just trying to carry out Lukashenko’s plans, (g) Belarusians are Russians and border is artificial.

There will be a large apparatus of Russian nuclear military and civilian personnel.  They will need “protection,” and the agreements will give Russia full easement rights to come in and seize total control at the first whisper of democracy.  They will send FSB to smoke out partisans, intimidate into compliance.  They will also try to intimidate any democratic-minded politician.

You don't really win wars.  There is a saying ""winning a war is like winning an earthquake"".  There are varying degrees of loss though.  The manner of loss can vary too.  

The risk of ""Ukraine losing"" has increased.  Over the year the standard for what we are talking about shifted.  Now if Ukraine's borders do not match 2014 people will call it capitulating.  

Moscow controls the media in Russia.  I believe Putin can just declare victory and march right out of Ukraine.  They can say the goal was to punish Ukraine.  The damage to Ukraine is quite evident.

Of Russian armored columns reaching Lviv?   In 2023? Using conventional weapons?  The odds are very near zero.  There is an ""anything can happen in war"" qualifier though.

We might see another year of the battle of Bakhmut.  Though it could be a second battle of Severodonetsk followed by a new Russian advance to Bakhmut.

The wildcard is what happens with eastern Ukraine where there has been fighting since 2014.

I think at that point they will slowly get the sanctions repealed layer by layer over time if they keep to the terms of any peace agreement/ceasefire, but they will have lost a lot of markets for their oil and gas for years to come, and in some cases permanently.  I also doubt there will be much if any further reparation demand aside from assets seized already.

A conscript unit can generally respond to one source of fire, like artillery, air, etc.  A trained unit can respond to two (i.e., a creeping barrage); a well trained unit may be able to respond to three, such as artillery & infantry & mechanized.  But the more you ramp up and diversity the sources of threat, the more you overload units, and this effect compounds.

This is why elite units like paratroopers are ""wasted"" on areas of the front that are heavily engaged; their training is more intense so they can better handle the high diversity of engagement sources.  It's also why Ukrainian forces are piling on the variety; drones gives them another avenue for it.

Usually this doesn't make units break & flee, and it may not even make them take more casualties, but it does make them sloppy and unable to defend against all the sources at once.  Training and discipline mitigates this largely--but are mobniks trained & disciplined?

Ukraine would NEVER Turn in to Belarus, in part because we had free election and permanent political struggle, and you know the most fucking important thing - changing of power. 

Instead in NATO we have people like Orban or Erdogan, who are nearing 20 years of their rule, and everyone is fine with that.

You know what happened in Ukraine after west turned us down? It amplified Russian sentiments like Crazy. Yanukovich was saying that West does not need us, that they will allways abandon us, and he fucking won massivly because of that. 

If in 2008 Putin got a stern message from the west, that Georgia and Ukraine WILL join NATO, he would have backed out and there would be no war in Georgia, no Crimea, and no 2022 invasion. But instead what Russia understood - is that they are free to use and abuse their neigbors as they see fit. And they thought (you know, with whole Russian rezet, then than weak af Crimea sanctions, or how they literally were allowed to annex part of someone elses land) that they will keep getting away with it.

It's a ridiculous point since the hurt the sanctions inflict on those innocent Russians is a slightly painful diminishing of their standard of living and economic opportunities, for the most part.  It sucks, but it pales in comparison to the hurt inflicted on Ukrainians by the Russian military.  If anybody is worried about the impact of these sanctions on innocent Russians, they should be far more worried about the impact of Russian tanks, munitions, cruise missiles, planes, and other equipment on innocent Ukrainians.

I don't think the innocence or guilt of the average Russian should really matter with respect to the sanctions.  These sanctions are almost certainly materially affecting Russia's ability to wage war on Ukraine.  I don't think there's any calculation where the cost of these sanctions on Russian innocents (however many there are) outweighs the cost on innocent Ukrainians in a scenario where Russia is allowed to wage war without restriction.  For the sake of argument, assume every single Russian with the exception of Putin is some unwilling hostage to the regime.  Even in this scenario, the cost of lifting sanctions on innocent Ukrainians is far worse than the cost of keeping them on for those innocent Russians.

It's for these reasons that I think the whole ""Putin's War"" vs. ""all Russians are guilty"" argument isn't really the right debate to have.  I don't think it should factor into the calculus of sanctions.  They should stay and be reinforced as long as they're slowing Russia's ability to supply its troops with weapons and equipment, which I believe they are.

The name 'Ukraine' comes from [the old Slavic word for 'borderlands'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Ukraine); this name is derived from the fact that Ukraine was the last outpost of either Kievan Rus', Polish, or Muscovian rule before the Ottoman Empire.

Referring to the country as 'The Ukraine' is/was unique to the English language, due to its translation as 'The Borderlands [of the Russian Empire]'.

Referring to Ukraine as 'The Ukraine' suggests that the speaker regards Ukraine as nothing more than than the periphery of the Russian Empire--and is obviously regarded as an insult. But trying to apply the same logic to the name of Russia does not yield the same result, because Russia derives its' name from the Kievan Rus', and ultimately their first king, Rurik. To refer to Russia as 'The Russia' legitimises Russia's claim to be the only true successor to the Russian Empire: to refer to Russia as 'The Russia' legitimises Russia's ambitions to rule Belarus and Ukraine.

A lose-lose situation for everyone is Russia collapses and its large amount of nuclear weapons go missing into the Middle East, Africa, or South America amidst the confusion, darkness, and corruption.

The West is basically threading a needle here trying to get Russia to run out of energy for this invasion without causing Russia to collapse in the process because the collapse of Russia has a bunch of bad knock on problems for geostability. Ideal outcome for the West is Ukraine retains most of its sovereign lands and Russia undergoes a peaceful regime change to someone a little less hostile to The West.

Russia is absolutely 100% gunning to support a non-NATO friendly US president in the next election.
