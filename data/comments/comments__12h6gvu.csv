Day 410-411 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past 2 days were somewhat quiet, the Russians did try to attack our cities with Shaheds as usual, but thankfully our air defense intercepted them. Yesterday 2 Shaheds were spotted somewhere in Kharkiv oblast at around 10pm, and then they were shot down less than 30 minutes later.

I‚Äôm not sure if there were more Shaheds in other regions, but most likely the answer is yes, because only launching 2 of them at a time is highly ineffective, and Russians know it. They also sometimes fire S-300 missiles along with Shaheds, which is what they did just recently in Zaporizhzhia, where they aimed at a bunch of private houses, completely destroying one of them and killing a little girl and her father. Those fucking bastards make my blood boil, they can‚Äôt win against our army so they fight defenseless civilians instead.

If the leaks about our soviet air defense systems running out of munitions soon are true, then this is really bad news. The S-300 systems are pretty much our main air defense asset right now and that‚Äôs not going to change overnight. While the couple of Patriots/SAMP-Ts and NASAMS that we are going to receive in the near future are great, they won‚Äôt be able to replace the dozens of S-300 systems that we have right now, there‚Äôs just not enough of them to protect everything.",False,1681172943.0,t3_12h6gvu,t3_12h6gvu,,0,111,0,111,0,0,

Here is a lecture by Timothy D. Snyder on why the Russian empire must be defeated:
https://mediacentrallive.princeton.edu/events/2023/empire-integration-and-ukraine 

It seems its not enough for this war to just end rather the  imperialist ambitions of Russia must be destroyed. Not doing so would risk a worse global outcome and create further instability in the future. 

Once the imperialist ambitions of Russia are removed it is believed a introspective period of reconstruction could commence within Russia which ultimately might result in an rule of law state finally emerging. Something which has eluded Russia ever since the Mongols imprinted their particularities in to the Russia psyche. 

Now the fact that this narrative of reality seems to be the prevailing consensus narrative within the US security and defense establishment must be absolutely horrific to the current power hierarchies currently in control of Russia. 

It must also be a beacon of light and hope to all of those Russian who today exist merely as serfs and playthings for those they serve. 

I hope the minds within the US defense and security establishment all the way from the bright minds of DARPA to the breathtakingly bold minds deep within the Central Intelligence Agency and all others come up with even more elaborate ways of lighting that flame of hope within each and every Russian so that maybe this war will end sooner rather than later as so many of our Russian posters here on reddit seem to want...

If the intelligence claim in that leaked file is correct, Ukraine will run out of virtually all of its air defense ammunition by the end of the third week of May, 2023.

The memo details a painstaking attempt by Western militarties to scrounge up alternative AA systems for Ukraine to use. None of them have the quantity or ease of use of a Buk or S-300. One of the replacement systems relies on a missile that is produced about 50 times per month, and that's one of the *better* rates of production for Western AA systems. To replace what Ukraine would be losing, Ukraine needs hundreds to more than a thousand AA missiles delivered to them every month.

This is not a funny issue. Unfortunately, it tracks rather closely to what OSINT people have suspected for months now. The Russian drone and cruise missile warms are unsustainably costly to defend. The startling end-date of mid May cited in the memo might be deliberately false, but it also could be real.

If it is real, Ukraine will be rendered more or less defenseless against Russian air strikes in about one month's time. All those fancy Western tanks and IFVs would be sitting ducks and would get demolished in quick glided bomb strikes by Russian JDAMs, and Ukraine's counteroffensive hopes would be over before they even get going.

One of the largest areas over overmatch in the Russia:Ukraine comparison is Russia's air power. Given open skies, Ukraine would be overwhelmed in days. Russia would very rapidly gain complete air superiority and Ukraine wouldn't really have a hope in the war from then on.

The main reason the skies over Ukraine are still contested are because of the AA systems Ukraine inherited from the USSR. The Soviets built world class anti-air systems and they built a _lot_ of them. It's just not safe for jets of either side to venture above the tree-tops because there's a line-up of missiles waiting for them.

However, their supplies are finite, and as with most Soviet equipment, Russia has vast supplies while Ukraine has much fewer. And Ukraine has been chewing through them. This is perhaps one of the largest effects of the Shaheed drones. Extremely cheap to produce, but force the usage of expensive and limited AA missiles.

The West doesn't _really_ have a good replacement for the stocks of S300. And nothing in the quantity that a country the size of Ukraine needs, at the price Ukraine needs it at.

The effect of this particular claim on Russian air command would not result in them just swallowing it uncritically and deploying all of their air power all at once into a trap. They would incrementally ramp up air strikes on Ukrainian forces and would pair it down if they start taking losses again.

Honestly, this is why I'm increasingly not buying this ""psyops"" argument. If we assume it is a psyops, how will it hurt Russia? Will it cause Russian commanders to order their forces to stop fortifying defenses? No. Why would they do that? If the article is to believed, Ukraine's air defenses are on their last legs, and all Russia would have to do is just keep sending a few more drone swarms at Ukrainian civilian targets and completely exhaust the S-300 and Buk ammo while they continue fortifying the south against a potential Ukrainian armored counteroffensive. It's not like Russia would say, ""Oh shit, Ukraine's out of air defenses. Let's drop all defensive preparation and attack everywhere all at once, even though side is on our side now!""

Russia sacrifices virtually nothing by holding off for another 2-3 months before starting a new assault that is backed up by air power. And if it turns out that the whole thing is a lie and Ukraine has plenty of air defense ammo left, then Russia can simply fall back on the defenses that they would have been building up the whole time anyway.

There just aren't a lot of ways in which this going to plausibly cause Russia to make mistakes. Russia has made serious mistakes and will continue making them, but those mistakes were primarily made out of a feeling of desperation by Putin's commanders, who needed to produce results for him ASAP or be fired.

NB: below I'm referring to KIA estimates.

The TLDR is Ukraine's numbers are high but could be potentially true, there were a few accidental leaks early on from Russia that were very close to Ukrainian numbers at the time. However it's been 12 months, I'd take Ukraine's as high-end. Personally I would think within 25% of Ukraine's numbers.

For the US numbers they use a formula with different data entry points. Their goal is to not underestimate their opponent so their numbers tend to be more conservative.

Roughly the formula goes like this:

1. Take each sides stated numbers

2. Apply some probability and data

3. Result.

The issue with this method is that it may assume both sides are equally wrong. But if you've ever caught two 5 year olds on different sides of something, you'll know one of them is usually telling blatant porkies.

""The truth lies somewhere in the middle"" I consider something akin to a logical fallacy, there's always the chance that one side is being truthful. There's probably a proper logic term for it but I call this 'averaged truth' which is where we hear two sides of a story and just subconsciously assume somewhere around the middle is 'true'.

So thus, I would view any US estimates as very conservative and they have mentioned that a few times themselves.

But casualty estimates are really hard and an imperfect mathematical endeavour. It's why looking back at wars it's usually a figure with a range - e.g. 40-80 million people died in WW2.

Many analysts will just work around specific numbers and talk about cause and effect with a likelihood. It's almost easier to do this. e.g. Russia's initial invasion force was depleted so they begun a 'partial' mobilisation, likely mobilising at least 300k troops, increasing manpower-to-equipment KIA ratios support the idea of an influx of personnel and changing combat strategy.",1681179031.0,1681177710.0,t3_12h6gvu,t1_jfqijhl,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Another thing is that you may have a casualty that would normally be counted as such, but with Russia's way of operating, that casualty could die from their survivable wounds a month later and you'd never know. So a normal model might apply a ratio of 3:1 wounded to every dead, but with Russia, that may very well be 2:1. 

My guess, these numbers are probably what they have a confirmation on in some form. Which would explain why they're not on par with other estimates. 

I'd say use these numbers as the ""low"" estimate and Minusrus as the ""high"" estimate. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.",1681165442.0,1681165195.0,t3_12h6gvu,t1_jfqijhl,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Indeed. Western SAMs are not really designed for the king of war that Ukraine is fighting. Patriot is not mobile enough and there is no integration into aviation (because Ukraine's remaining air force is tiny and obsolete).

However, you can build such a network piece by piece. Patriot radars can tie into NASAMS systems. Have multiple NSASMS systems integrated together with other NATO radars that have been given to Ukraine and they'll slowly morph into an integrated defense system.

Even a few direct hits won't do much probably, you're going to need a lot of them.

Since the US and NATO shares so much intelligence with Ukraine I have no doubt they study train movements over the bridge but if the method of attack was a truck bomb then the timing of that depends on traffic onto the bridge, how long an inspection takes. So even if you know the train is stopped there at the time it still takes some luck to be able to blow your truck bomb up beside it. If it was a boat bomb then you might be able to better estimate when it will arrive but even then sea conditions could affect that. Also you can't assume your explosion will be enough to also damage the train enough to cause a fire, you could say that it should be big enough but if you don't know exactly where your boat or truck bomb is going to be when it blows up it's another point of uncertainty. Seems like everyone agrees the size of explosion, and lack of anything visible in the sky, means an attack by a missile is unlikely given how it dropped an entire span of the road deck.

So however they attacked it there was still an element of timing and luck involved in the train going up in flames as well.

Not in the slightest, and I am a big fan of increased EU coordination, militarization and interdependence. *That being said*, Macron didn't say ""the EU should have a common defense policy"" or ""the EU should increase Defense spending"" or ""The EU should preferentially purchase EU indigenous defense systems"". What he said was that ""the Europeans shouldn't follow the US's lead"". 

The subtext here (as I read it) is that A: Europe should be lead by the French. It is far from the first time he has made noises in this general direction and (especially given that they still *are* an empire to some extent) it usually lands with a bit of a sour note when they start to sound imperial about their place in europe. B: France is pissy enough about AUKUS that they would like (and ideally all of Europe with them) to do more business with China and less with the US, even if this comes at the cost of China doing to Taiwan what Russia wants to do to Ukraine. 

There is a fair chance that some or all of this is posturing and I think that France acting as an anti-US outsider provides intelligence and negotiation opportunities to the ""Western Alliance"" that might not be there if they consistently acted like they were one of our oldest geopolitical allies. As shit as the US can be at times, I think that moving towards China out of spite right now would be ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" and I feel like that is/should be obvious, but the situation in France seems a little extreme even by their standards, so I don't know where his head is at...

That should be applauded and credited, but it's a bit soon for France to be calling America of all countries cheap when it comes to fulfilling its NATO commitments when it spends more than all NATO allies combined.  If America spent the same percentage of GDP that France now does on its military, it would be an approximately 40% cut to military spending.",1681127718.0,1681121985.0,t3_12h6gvu,t1_jfo6ev0,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Western tanks are better at it, but if you put an un-escorted Leopard 2 or Abrams up against a single ambushing squad with a Kornet ATGM hidden in a tree line two klicks away, my money is going to be on the wire-guided ATGM and not the tank.

These tanks are not magic bullets for minefields, artillery, or AT missiles.

It does not ultimately matter who makes your tanks -- T-72s, T-90s, Leopards, Challengers and Abrams will all die if a pre-sighted barrage of grads or 152mm lands on top of them while they are slowly picking their way through a front-line minefield.

What Leopards are best it is the stage that comes *after* a breakthrough -- the runaway phase as they race for the rear supply hubs to cut off enemy lines of reinforcement and retreat. But yes, the minefield breakthrough stage is going to be dicey. Ukraine was never able to do this very fast or effectively at the Kherson theater, and they took heavy armor losses as a result.
