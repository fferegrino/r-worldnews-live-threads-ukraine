Day 74 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet again, but we heard plenty of our artillery throughout the day, and while it’s not all that scary if you are indoors, it is still very scary when you are outside. It is so loud, that it still startles you even when you know that it’s safe.

[I took some photos of that destroyed kiosk that I was talking about a couple of days ago.](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaberFlux/comments/uleq53/a_kiosk_near_me_that_was_destroyed_a_couple_of/) That is some intense level of destruction for a single shell. Most likely it was a rocket from MLRS, as there are other places that were hit over a hundred meters away during that same shelling.

That kiosk really saved the apartment building in front of it. Not only did it save most windows from breaking by absorbing the shockwave, but there are also usually people sitting on benches right in front of that kiosk, so it might have even saved some lives, there were no casualties in that shelling.

Also there are almost always people standing near that water vending machine, and some might have been standing there during that shelling as well, but everyone including the vending machine survived because they were shielded by the kiosk, which got completely thrashed. Good thing it was closed, if there was someone inside chances are they have been either killed immediately, or seriously wounded.

The weirdest thing today was definitely Putin wishing us a peaceful and just future, what the fuck is this? You are attacking and destroying our country and at the same time wishing us peace? This is just insane and absolutely disgusting. If you want peace then get the fuck out of our country. How the fuck can you say that you wish us peace and then launch cruise missiles at our cities right after?

Let’s see what will happen tomorrow and during the night, Mykolaiv is being brutally shelled right now and there are explosions in Odesa again, presumably from cruise missiles. But it’s alright because those are peace missiles, filled with Putin’s peaceful intentions, right?",False,1652054969.0,t3_uktnbc,t3_uktnbc,,0,115,0,115,5,0,

Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said earlier on Saturday that Ukrainian forces still controlled the area. ""The situation is very difficult, but under control,"" Gaidai said in a Telegram video post.

He added that Chechen troops were not taking part in fighting, but were looting and taking videos.

Kadyrov has frequently posted on Telegram reports and videos of Chechen soldiers allegedly participating in activities in Ukraine, but there has been no confirmation of how many have actually been deployed and whether they have participated in fighting.

The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue.

Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated.

But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender.

""A large Russian landing ship with signs of damage was seen in Sevastopol

ROMAN PETRENKO - SUNDAY, MAY 8, 2022, 4:14 P.M.

Two large landing ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet stand near the berths in Sukharnaya Bay, which is part of the large Sevastopol Bay. One of them has external signs of damage.

Source : "" Crimea. Realities ""

Details : Two large landing ships of the 775 project are currently stationed in Suharnaya Bay.

It is noted that the Black Sea Fleet has four such ships: ""Caesar Kunikov"" (board number 158), ""Novocherkassk"" (142), ""Yamal"" (156) and ""Azov"" (151).

One of the VDKs in Suharnaya Bay has visible signs of damage - large red spots on the port side. This color has a primer, which is applied before painting with gray paint.

After the beginning of Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, the board numbers of all warships were painted to complicate the identification of similar units.

We will remind : In the Crimea the captain of the ship ""Caesar Kunikov"" which was lined up near Berdyansk was buried .""

It was no coincidence that his invasion of Ukraine came a day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, a celebration of Russia’s military achievements. It was on that same occasion in 2014 that Putin took the first step in annexing Crimea from Ukraine, through orchestrated pro-Russian protests on the peninsula.

The leader had clearly hoped to have more to celebrate by this Victory Day on Monday, the country’s most patriotic of dates, marking the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany in World War II.

Russia’s justification for war in Ukraine suggested a deadline for success by Victory Day.

Even though the Kremlin’s well-oiled propaganda machine has been going at full steam since the February invasion, it will be difficult for Putin to twist Russia’s losses into true victory on Monday.

If anything, the operation in Ukraine has been an embarrassment for him – at least on the international stage.

This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steel works, the last pocket of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol.

First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, said they were under intense Russian shelling, and that the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military.

Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising ""the government"", without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified.

""Nobody expected we would last so long and we’re still lasting, we’re still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol. Failed in the preparation.""

Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something rejected by Lt Samoilenko.

""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we can’t grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know this. It’s why we fight so fearlessly.""",False,1652019683.0,t3_uktnbc,t3_uktnbc,,0,58,0,58,0,0,

Good morning fellow doomscrollers, or as those of us not rooting for the russians can call it -- slavascrolling...

Today is the 74^th day of combat in this illegal war;  It's mother's day; It's the [American VE day](https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/1523120503090733056) (victory Europe); And it's one day away from May 9th, the russian victory day.  

And what does putin have to show his people?

In my last [\[Analysis\] thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/uh7pck/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i76vu6s/), I harped on a little noticed Ukrainian victory in [Staryi Saltiv](https://twitter.com/georgewbarros/status/1521648294988034054), a little nondescript town north-east of Kharkiv.  Turns out that town did indeed [mark the collapse](https://twitter.com/blacksmithVakul/status/1521035557794684928) of the russian assault in the Kharkiv area.  To avoid being caught in a cauldron, russian forces withdrew their forces and like Kyiv, Ukrainian forces are now  [just mopping up stragglers to the russian border](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1523095533971283968).

Putin has nothing to show but dust and corpses on his Kharkiv front.

Which leaves that dreaded [""pincer of doom""](https://twitter.com/Intrepid_2011/status/1521926440484106241) in the Donbas the russian trolls have been crowing about since Kyiv...   Well, Ukraine has pushed the fight almost to [Izyum's borders](https://twitter.com/Nrg8000/status/1522861125100240896).  

That invasion force crawling south of Izyum had to return to russia for their heavy casualties.  So the ""pincer of doom"" is no more.  Between the direct assault on Izyum and the Ukrainian control of the Kharkiv area blockading most of Izyum's supply lines, [The Donbas offensive](https://kyivindependent.com/national/russias-offensive-in-donbas-bogs-down/) is withering and dying on the vine.

So all putin has to show his people on May 9^th is more dust and death in the Donbas region.

Now don't get me wrong, russia did have some good news!   There are early reports that the russian 64th separated motorized brigade, the butchers of Bucha, were [utterly decimated in Izyum (Kharkiv district)](https://twitter.com/olex_scherba/status/1523014965522743297) and presumably their commander, [Lt Colonel Omurbekov Azatbek Asanbekovich](https://twitter.com/chuckpfarrer/status/1523033033477005312).  Why is this good for putin you ask?  Well these people won't be able to testify in the Hague any longer...

Turning our attention to the south, we see mostly static lines, but there was a [great assault on Snake Island](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1523027490230444035) yesterday which took out a [naval troop carrier](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukraine-reports-sinking-another-russian-warship-near-snake-island?via=twitter_page) (yes, the little country without a navy takes down another naval vessel!)...   Oh, as an aside, the Snake Island assault makes it very unlikely Transnistria will be drawn into the conflict.

But wait, there's more!  Remember those rumors about russian frigate ~~Markov~~ Makarov?  Well they are still rumors, but Ukraine didn't exactly deny them, and is [unofficially confirming them](https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1522888321847996416).  The actual ship is nowhere to be found, and there's a good chance we'll find out, officially, what happened on -- you guessed it -- May 9^th...   Which would be great timing to sink putin's May 9^th parade.  Still file this one under ""nice to have"" until it's actually official...

And in other good news, it's reported that the Soldiers in the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are [set to be evacuated](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1523069732886552576) by the Red Cross, most likely on -- you guessed it May 9^th -- most likely under the guise of a temporary ceasefire which would allow russia to conduct its planned ""victory"" parade in downtown Mariupol.

So in the south, an uneasy stalemate, but ultimately more dust and corpses for putin's war.

And finally a reminder that it's Mother's day.  If you don't get off the computer for a few hours and go see the important Mothers in your life, russian soldiers will have nothing on the misery you will soon experience!",1651984699.0,1651982484.0,t3_uktnbc,t3_uktnbc,,0,78,0,78,0,0,

The timeline to pull this off was more likely due to the changing political situation in numerous countries and due to what he perceived as weak political and military leadership in Ukraine.

**Fascist Hungary dreams of the Kingdom of Hungary**

> According to the head of the Ukrainian Security Council, Hungary had ""its own plans"" for part of Ukraine. Those who shake their heads in disbelief are making the same mistake towards Hungary that the West has been making towards Russia for years - not listening to what Orbán says, or at least not taking him seriously enough. His entire speech on the centenary of the Treaty of Trianon is a bizarre mixture of 19th century primitive nationalism and modern Hungarian fascism, but this passage in particular is worth noting:

> ""Only the state has borders, the nation has none. This is the law. Someone understood it, someone didn't. Those who haven't would do better to hurry up, because their time is running out.""

> Certainly, the idea that the Hungarian state would today try to annex the territories of its neighbours, whether Slovakia, Romania or Ukraine, is rather ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that our fellow Hungarians of Hungarian nationality would welcome the ""liberators"" in the same way that Russian-speaking Ukrainians welcome the Russian horde. They would not shower them with flowers, but with Molotov cocktails. They know best how life is in Hungary today, and they have something to compare it with.

> The claim that the Ukrainians are fighting for us too is no empty propaganda cliché. You can take it quite literally. If Putin completely collapses in Ukraine, loses the war and puts Russia into long-term isolation and decline, the wet dreams of the Hungarian irredent will fall with him, at least for the next couple of generations.

""Defenders of Mariupol told how the Marine commander fled the city

ROMAN PETRENKO - SUNDAY, MAY 8, 2022, 3:09 P.M.

Intelligence officer Ilya Samoilenko said that the commander of the 36th Brigade of Ukrainian Marines Volodymyr Baranyuk decided to flee the besieged Mariupol, taking with him people, tanks and ammunition.

Source : Samoilenko during a briefing with Azovstal

Samoilenko's direct speech : One could run away like a coward, think only of one's own life, but not think of one's own duty, the oath he took. This is exactly what happened to the commander of the Marines of the 36th Brigade. He simply refused to obey the order that was issued to him.

And he tried to escape from the city with a small group of working tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition.

… Here (from Mariupol - ed.) You can't break through, but if you think only about your life, you will seize every opportunity to prolong this life.

It's a great shame. ""

Details : Samoilenko reminded that they are now more than 100 kilometers from the main positions.

The commander of the Azov Regiment, Denis Prokopenko, also spoke about this in an interview with Ukrayinska Pravda .

Prokopenko's direct speech : ""Then suddenly the commander of the 36th Brigade decided, without warning anyone, to simply make a breakthrough in an unknown direction and thus lose many people. Similarly, many people were abandoned and they were simply taken prisoner.

If this had not happened, we could have kept the defense on the right bank for a long time, but the flank was exposed and after the clearing of the Ilyich plant was completed, the enemy threw all its forces in our direction - it allowed him to attack us from the flank and rear. "" .

We will remind : Russian mass media already showed Baranyuk in captivity.""

They asked questions about what \[soldiers thought\] an acceptable objective to declare victory for this war \[would be\], and you have around 25 percent saying that \[they would\] need the complete capitulation of Ukraine and more than 30 percent saying they would want to get Russian troops to the border with Poland.*  
*But the most astonishing number is that only 6 percent said they would be happy with only \[taking the\] Donbas. That is very worrying. It means that the objectives pronounced by Putin at the beginning of the war are not necessarily the same ones the military sees as appropriate and acceptable.*

(...)

*RFE/RL: Is it just looking for a scapegoat or do you also get a sense that there is a genuine urge to understand the mistakes and learn from them?*  
  
*Soldatov: The problem here is that \[there isn’t\] a tradition in the Russian military or the Russian security services to \[acknowledge\] and \[learn from\] the mistakes they’ve made.*

**What the Public Thinks of Victory Day**

*The Soviet Union’s struggle and ultimate victory in World War Two is still perceived by Russian citizens as the most important event of the 20th century. 80 percent of respondents surveyed in January of 2017 confirmed that they celebrated the 9th of May. The second most significant event is Yuri Gagarin’s space flight (58 percent), and the collapse of the USSR ranks third (44 percent). A similar ranking was registered in 2012, and this order of merit has remained unchanged in subsequent years. The importance attached to this day is indicative of the scale of the tragedy and the fact that the Russian state pays special attention to celebrating the victory of the Soviet Union in World War Two.*

(...)

*Over the last few years, Victory Day has acquired new connotations associated with Russia’s ongoing political conflict with Western countries. It’s seemingly non-coincidental that notorious car stickers emblazoned with the words: “1941-1945 We can do it again” appeared a few years ago. Some assumed that the meaning behind the stickers was that Russia would “do it again”, this time to America. It is hard to say to what extent these stickers were folk art and to what extent they were inspired by those at the top. Certainly, the construction of a replica of the Reichstag in the military-themed Patriot park near Moscow in the spring of 2017 and subsequent reenactment of the attack on the Reichstag attended by Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu was indeed a state initiative. Had relations between Russia and Germany been in better shape, such a reenactment would hardly have been possible.*

B: Declare the Military Operation a “Success” if Russia really wants out of this war since they are getting their asses handed to them, now would be the perfect time as they could just save face and make up some excuse that “are objectives are complete” or “we got rid of the nazis”

This is not true. The sketchy FSB leaks are published in Russian by a Russian expat who heads a torture victims NGO. The publisher's name is Vladimir Osechkin. The letters are supposedly written by an anonymous low level FSB bureaucrat. This supposed bureaucrat claims to be stuck in the FSB because he's a trouble maker, similar to how the FBI hires criminal hackers. 

Osechkin often has not put in the effort to translate his organization's work into English. This includes the sketchy FSB letters. This is where a stranger called Igor Sushko realizes he can get attention by translating these letters and posting the translations on Twitter. The way he published the translations made people think that Igor was getting the letters. He adds some footnotes that explains some Russian idioms in the letters. He also draws out the translations, even though a 1 minute Google translate is nearly as good. This is likely to build suspense. He also posts low quality analysis, and shares other people's reports in order to build his audience. He's just a random, shallow, social media influencer. 

Osechkin is just happy that someone is spreading the letters, and he still hasn't translated a good chunk of his stuff into English.  Here's a link to his NGO for Torture Victims: https://gulagu.net/

This is purely speculation, based on discussions I've had with friends from different spheres of knowledge and with different experiences... None of us claim to be experts but have a wide knowledge base.

*So please remember as you read, this is not sourced but is analysis based on situation as we see it from open source info such as what we see in this reddit*

So what is Putin likely to announce, and what could he announce today? What are the implications of such announcements?

This is just a short thought-piece.


**Likely:** Expanded use of Rosgvardia, extension of any conscipt contracts, expansion of the rules to allow employment in Ukraine.

The expanded use of Rosgvardia and conscipts would be the most that Putin can feasibly and functionally (supply/logistics anyone?) do. By doing so, he can push them forward to function as second line troops, possibly freeing up other troops and conscipts to plug gaps in his forces. How he does it policy wise is up for grabs as he can do whatever he wants and frame it however he wishes to his people.

Feasibly - maybe as many as 250k more available troops, but take that with a heavy handful of salt and keep in mind Russian equipment and supply issues aren't going anywhere.

The strains on logistics and supply from such a surge in numbers will be big, so expect if this is announced to begin hearing about such issues further down the track timewise.


**Unlikely:** Full/partial mobilisation.

Any form of mobilisation is a possible outcome, only because it's a bad strategic decision and Putin has been making a lot of them. However if we consider all the known factors, including the impacts on the Russian domestic economy to a full or even partial mobilisation, it's a really dumb decision.

Russia has struggled to consistently supply and maintain 200k troops in this war. Adding 450-900k more to that is just going to make it worse.

Further to this, many of Russia's weapons and vehicles it would need to use to equip and use such troops are either old, decrepit or both.

Mobilisation would be another own-goal strategically, economically and logistically, thus is unlikely.



**Very unlikely:** Peace talks, mission success or withdrawal.

Putin has at no point during this war indicated or signalled or even considered calling this war off. So the chances that he'll use what is a very nationalistic day like May 9 to announce a mission success without succeeding, is very unlikely.


**Round-up**

Putin will most likely announce something, even if it equates to nothing. If he doesn't do something to change the conditions on the ground there is every chance that Ukraine will begin to push Russia out over the next month or two.

The strongest move Putin could make to impact things on the ground in Ukraine is doing some tricky business with Rosgvardia and Conscipts.

I hope he'll announce his victory and fuck off back to Russia, but nothing we are seeing is indicating that's a possible outcome.

But Putin can surprise us all, many of us thought he wouldn't be stupid enough to invade in the first place... 



Edit: Also keep in mind with any mobilisation, there is a major leadership and training issue. It'll take a month or two for training (if they even have the ability to) and Russia doesn't have USSRs big numbers of officers to help lead mobilisation forces. Same same with conscript intakes, each intake has a minimum training time.


NB: not an expert, just thought it was worth putting up some potential outcomes and the why/not of it all. Also, please forgive any grammar/typos.",1652062780.0,1652060942.0,t3_uktnbc,t3_uktnbc,,0,15,0,15,1,0,

There are 6 more critical points to defend.

 - Oleksandropillia (small village)
 - Komshuvaka (mid sized village)
 - Vrubivka (small village)
 - Mykolaivka (small village, heavily wooded)
 - T1302 intersection
 - Verkhn'okam'yanka (big urban industrial area) +  Zolotarivka (small town) - potential for massive urban fighting here ala Azovstal
 - another T1302 intersection

If Russia manages to push through to Komshuvaka, Zolote becomes at risk of getting flanked and may have to pull back to Hirske and bunker down there. Given how small these villages are, there's a high likelihood this might happen.

If there would ever have been a war between Russia and NATO this is how the west would have fought the war, mainly with their superior airforce. So why aren't we considering arming Ukraine with western jets? Obviously this takes a lot of time but it doesn't seem like the war will be over soon. And this would allow Ukraine to not only regain air superiority but also to use all the NATO-compatible ordnance: cruise missiles, laser guided bombs, air-to-air missiles to shoot down Russian jets, etc. All the superior weapons that give NATO the edge are mainly designed for being used with jets, hence the military doctrine that's centered around airpower.

Oryx losses are a reasonably solid baseline, as they are photo verified. There are occasional verification mistakes and double counting though.

Underreporting is going to be an issue though, as Ukrainians will take photos of destroyed Russian hardware more than their own, and vice versa. Russians are however less likely to have phone access or post on social medial where it can be accessed and catalogued.

There is also a big difference between capture and putting back in service. Definitely some of those captures will be usable, and there is evidence of some hardware being captured and reused multiple times, but others might only be good as a source of spare parts due to damage.

Still, those numbers are significantly above what Russia self reports (but far below what Ukraine claims as kills).",False,1651991600.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7rmifb,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

Kherson was given up by traitors.

""According to Gordeev, all of these defenses could’ve been deployed in a single day. Instead, none of them were. Instead, the newspaper reports that “Incumbent Governor Gennady Laguta, according to colleagues, on the first day of the [special operation] put the keys on the mayor's desk with the words: ""I do not participate in this"" - and left the region.” Furthermore, “Together with him - on the first day of the special operation - the leadership of the police, the prosecutor's office, the courts left, and a little later SBU officers were evacuated.” (SBU officers are Ukraine’s intelligence officers.)

While other cities competently recruited, armed, and deployed their territorial defense forces—civilian partisans, Kherson seemingly willfully neglected theirs. “I go to this commander of the defense, say: ‘Dima, what is it?’ He didn't even have a map of Kherson on his desk. Do you understand? Volunteers resorted during the day, stood near the military enlistment office, did not know what to do.” TDF volunteers lined up at a base waiting for their weapons that never arrived. They were told to wait, wait, and wait, until eventually, the commander told them never mind, he had evacuated. Their desperate effort to cobble together any kind of resistance cost them 67 TDF soldiers, and that guy who died blowing one of the two bridges. But in the end, the [main bridge survived](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1498855012532989956?s=20&t=MKdvldJV7HgxPd6_oYVGsQ). """,False,1652025157.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7t2tgp,,1,33,0,33,0,0,

Russia's armed forces are geared up for one type of conflict only - major land war against a peer with tanks at the forefront. There's also a legacy from the USSR which presumes that any such conflict would be post-nuclear and so other forms of combat vehicle would be less relevant, logistics would be of lower importance than self-sufficient scavenging and individual tank groups would need to operate almost in isolation assuming they're the only survivors.

They've done terribly at diversifying. Even the ""other"" conflicts they've been involved in, like Syria, they've fought as if they were simply a land war with the emphasis on tank-enabled attrition not agility.

The British Armed Forces are predominantly geared up for the kinds of operations the UK has been involved in, and actually underwent substantial restructuring about 30 years ago. Mostly, it;s about COIN, naval aviation, SF (particularly deniable operations in hostile territory), recon and intel gathering.

For example, ""Iraq has WMDs, Hussein has to be dealt with"" is much easier to sell then ""Saudi Arabia is starting to get pissed off with Hussein, so were gonna deal with him so that we can continue to get oil from Saudi, and more from Iraq.""

Sources conflict about what the time difference was in early May 1945, but the results were the same: When the final Nazi surrender document was signed in Berlin, it was already the next day in Moscow, even if just barely.

So even though basically everyone in the world to this day agrees to pretend the Nazis surrendered on May 8 for the sake of simplicity and historians’ sanity, they’re referring to the time and date in Berlin. In Moscow, it was either one minute or one hour and one minute into the next day: May 9.

bb06ebfc61fd9a758d98fb0a362bd66e,uktnbc,i7sseiy,"To assault Odessa Russia would need to establish an overland line of communications first with any amphibious invasion force. They would have to break out of Kherson, take Mykolaiv, and approach Odessa by land from the east and north. This isn't happening because they lack the strength. They are likely at force parity with UA forces on that front, and are observed to be on the defense with only limited capabilities for offensive action. Simply put, they lack the numbers for that kind of breakthrough.   


If they launched an unsupported amphibious assault it would be wiped out. Their ability to land troops is limited by the size of the Black Sea fleet. They can't reinforce that fleet due to the nature of Turkey's control of the straights connecting the Mediterranean with the Black Sea. Realistically they could only land 1-2000 troops and equipment, which is not enough to capture the city. That is if they did not take losses on the approach, and their ability to cover such a landing would likewise be limited. Odessa is far for Russia aviation to operate, and their ability to conduct precision strikes and offer close air support lacks evidence that it would be up to the task in any case. There's a good chance Ukrainian coastal defenses would sink a large chunk of such a landing force before it even made it ashore.   


There is the other, even wilder proposal that they could instead land west of Odessa and assault Moldova first, with the aid of Transnistrian forces then pivot east and attack Odessa from the west and north. This relies on the same assumptions that they could pull a landing off as above. Caveat being this section of coast is less defended, but Ukraine will not be idle and can likely react as any amphibious force buildup is going to be obvious and they are being supplied with intelligence from NATO. Transnistrian forces consist of about 1500 regular Russian troops, and around 7000 Transnistrian forces who are seriously under equipped and poorly trained and led. The ability for a Russian landing group to fight through Ukrainian defenses, link up with Transnistrian forces now engaged with Moldovan army, defeat them, and have the force to then engage Ukraine around Odessa is very low. Keep in mind all this will happen hundreds of miles from the nearest Russian forces. They will be unable to resupply for this entire operation unless they can bring supplies in by sea, and then defend those supply lines which will be tenuous, at best.

The other possibility is that NATO goes into ""conventional but defensive"" mode and just completely neuters any ability of Russia to wage war in the region - think the sinking of the *entire* Black Sea Fleet, destruction of all Russian anti-air systems, air supremacy with denial of even nearby Russian airspace, destruction of any and all Russian air assets, obliteration of all Russian army bases and staging grounds plus arsenals and stockpiles even deep into Russia, ground troops sweeping through Transnistria and all of Ukraine.

I wonder what will happen in a country like Hungary if Russia ends up losing and basically collapses? After they have chipped in with Russia it will look fantastically bad. The political turmoil and the sheer cognitive dissonance of defeat will be huge. There will be hell to pay in many countries if Russia basically shrinks away and becomes ineffectual on the world stage. A number of countries are going to find out that one of their biggest allies or psychological partners just disappears. The degree of this will vary but Brazil, Hungary, Syria, India, Serbia, Belarus etc. all rely on good Russian relations to some degree or the other, either economic, military or just plain ideological. How will their politics go if Russia just goes *poof*? It will be very hard for countries to justify to their people why they bet the losing horse. India for example is going to face the hard truth that their main weapons supplier isn't going to be supplying them with anything for the near future. Chipping in with Russia even at a limited scale is turning out to be a huge mistake. Hungary especially will look really stupid with their oil and gas woes if Russia unequivocally loses etc.

2. Russia doesn't want MAD and there's no way they could use nuclear weapons that would not bring about guaranteed destruction of Russia to a substantial performance. Everything they could dish out to the West, they would receive at least the same back in kind.

3. Because it's worth pushing back against nuclear tyranny now whilst that's still possible.

 >The Yugoslav Wars were a series of separate but related ethnic conflicts, wars of independence, and insurgencies fought in the former Yugoslavia  from 1991 to 2001, leading up to and resulting from the breakup of the Yugoslav federation in 1992. Its constituent republics declared independence due to unresolved tensions between ethnic minorities in the new countries, which fueled the wars. Most of the wars ended through peace accords, involving full international recognition of new states, but with a massive human cost and economic damage to the region.

He also mentioned that Russia will be fully mobilized by then, implication being that Russia holding back (obvious they have to some degree) and that bad weather is the major reason for their failures. 

No one is even necessarily certain yet as to whether Putin will fully mobilize. The CIA director mentioned that Putin can’t afford to lose. In my view, and this is just me, but I can’t imagine the Russian people, or powerful supporters of Putin would view simply maintaining ground they’ve already gained as a “win” if you decide to fully mobilize. Mobilizing increases the “requirements” for a “win” IMO and in that world just keeping what you’ve already gained, with even MORE investment, seems like a hard sell as a win. I suppose if he’s genuinely concerned that Ukraine will take significant portions back, then he may be forced to do this. But then you get into an even longer protracted war, and you can’t manipulate the Ruble forever, sanctions will continue to cause damage, nvm new sanctions. And this man is saying time is on Russia’s side, I just don’t see it.

The leaders of Cuba and Venezuela dismiss the statements of foreigners on the grounds that they are “imperialists.” The leaders of China have spent a decade disputing the human-rights language long used by international institutions, successfully convincing many people around the world that these “Western” concepts don’t apply to them. Russia has gone beyond merely ignoring foreign criticism to outright mocking it. After the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny was [arrested earlier this year](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/alexei-navalny-showing-russians-what-courage/618666/), Amnesty International designated him a “prisoner of conscience,” a venerable term that the human-rights organization has been using since the 1960s. Russian social-media trolls immediately mounted a campaign designed to draw Amnesty’s attention to 15-year-old statements by Navalny that seemed to break the group’s rules on offensive language. Amnesty took the bait and removed the title. Then, when Amnesty officials realized they’d been manipulated by trolls, [they restored it](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/05/statement-on-alexei-navalnys-status-as-prisoner-of-conscience/). Russian state media cackled derisively. It was not a good moment for the human-rights movement.""

On the third of January, 2018, America publicly issued a nuclear threat from the White House against North Korea:

> North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!

This threat came some months after America had loudly publicised the presence of [their nuclear submarines](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-submarines-idUSKBN18K15Y) off the Korean coast.

The former president who issued this written communiqué from the Oval Office has since gone on record to say that, were he still in office today, he would be making [similar threats](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia) against Russia.",1652048704.0,1652047862.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7uk24y,,2,-7,0,-7,0,0,

The KGB surveilled Freeland and tapped her phone calls, and documented the young Canadian activist delivering money, video and audio recording equipment, and a personal computer to contacts in Ukraine. She used a diplomat at the Canadian embassy in Moscow to send material abroad in a secret diplomatic pouch, worked with foreign journalists on stories about life in the Soviet Union, and organised marches and rallies to attract attention and support from western countries. On her return from a trip to London in March 1989, Freeland was denied re-entry to the USSR.[25] By the time her activism within Ukraine came to an end, Freeland had become the subject of a high-level case study from the KGB on how much damage a single determined individual could inflict on the Soviet Union; a 2021 Globe and Mail article quoted the report by a former officer of the KGB, which had described Freeland as ""a remarkable individual"", ""erudite, sociable, persistent, and inventive in achieving her goals"".[25]",False,1652023630.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7sztxr,,3,17,0,17,0,0,

In the above video former US Army tanker Ryan McBeth breaks down the suspected T3R ratio of the average Russian brigade, which officially are supposed to have 2 Battalion Tactical Groups each. Ryan comes to a conclusion that it's about 1.1 support soldiers for every frontline fighter. 

In order to make a BTG cmbat ineffective, I'd estimate that you need to inflict roughly 25% casualties if they are primarily inflicted on the combat elements, or about 50% of the total frontline combat units. That's about 200-300 soldiers per unit plus their associated equipment like tanks and IFVs. If mixed between frontline troops and support units, you'd probably need to kill or destroy at least 50% of the whole BTG to make the unit completely combat ineffective where it needs to retreat and replenish in Russia.",False,1652006401.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7s3rqx,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

4b954d2569080147221f33fb85c8c702,uktnbc,i7ve4ou,"Musk has Asperger's, which is a form of Autism. Asperger's makes it very difficult to understand what is socially acceptable and what isn't. He openly admits this - just watch his introduction on Saturday Night Live a few months back.

On top of this, Tesla stock has shot up over the past few years - making Musk the richest man on the planet. This has increased his public profile as more people start to hear about him and more news articles about him begin to appear.

This dovetails in a bad way with my first point: Musk doesn't understand how social situations work. Now there's a big ol' spotlight being shone on him in a way he hasn't had to deal with before, and he continues to say/do things which are not seen as socially acceptable. This feeds the media articles about him, which shines the public spotlight brighter, which contributes to this negative feedback loop centered on Elon.

I have Asperger's myself, so I can sort of see what this might look like from Elon's perspective. He's acting like he always does, but ""for some reason"" now a bunch of people are tweeting negative things at him. People are telling him that he shouldn't be so rich, that he asks too much from his workers, and are generally treating him as hostile - but he doesn't understand why.

So he doubles down against the criticism - famously, someone mentioned that it would cost $6.6 billion to solve world hunger. He asked for a source and that if it was true, he would give $6.6 billion. An organization (I believe it was linked to the UN) gave him a source, but he didn't find it reputable and didn't donate. Then he doesn't understand why everyone is mad at him - he didn't think the math was reputable and didn't want to ""waste"" his money! But outside observers see him as backing down from his end of the deal, especially given that he drops $40 billion to buy Twitter a few months later.

This has led Elon to make a harder shift towards libertarianism and the alt-right, while claiming to be a ""centrist"". He sees the Neoconservatives (Bush) backed by big oil trying to make him fall, he sees the Neoliberals (Biden) as being too pro-union and threatening his work model, and he sees the progressives (Bernie Sanders) as being upset just because he has money and they don't. So from his point of view, the only ""welcoming"" side of the internet is the alt-right tech bro sphere.

He feels that Twitter is trying to crack down on this side of the political spectrum by banning members of the alt-right and ""censoring"" their speech. So to defend his allies and give a ""safe space"", the obvious solution for Musk is to buy Twitter and enforce a ""neutrality"" policy - unbanning people like Trump. The Paradox of Tolerance (the idea that a tolerant society must be intolerant towards intolerance) is beyond him; he considers the mere act of banning anyone as unacceptable censorship.

But again - from an outside observer, the richest man on Earth is going through with a plan to buy a massive social media platform in the name of politics, unleashing the worst aspects of 2016-2020 once again. It's well-established what damage Twitter as a platform can do, and it's also been established that deplatforming _works_ as a way to moderate discussion and prevent the worst elements from drowning out everyone else.

Musk is threatening to reverse that - and bear in mind that he has a history of sending his Twitter followers out to harass others. He also has used his status to pump-and-dump various stocks/crypto (whether he realizes it or not), and now instead of one account he now is about to control an entire social media company. He's flagrantly broken the law several times and has shown the SEC to be toothless (even going as far as to say that the SEC is a three-letter acronym, middle word is ""Elon's"").

I don't think anyone would deny that Musk's companies are doing great things. Starlink is helping Ukraine, and SpaceX/Tesla have revolutionized their respective industries. But the man himself doesn't know how to act publicly and is ultimately out to help himself first and foremost. He has a deep-seated Messiah complex and judges everyone by the standards he sets for himself - and finds many of them wanting. After all, _he_ is willing to work 18-hour days, _he_ doesn't care about his friends or family, so therefore anyone who doesn't follow his lead isn't worth his time.

He's a complex figure, and he's both incredibly smart and really, really dumb. But he also has a medical condition which prevents him from seeing how dumb he is, like a giant blind spot. He knows it's there (just like how I know mine is there), but he needs to consciously make an effort to think of others... which is hard to do when every move you do is under a microscope, and frankly you're too rich to care.",False,1652062319.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7v81we,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Introduced in 2007, it was deployed to Afghanistan in late 2007, and to South Korea two years later, in September 2009. Some images and details of the aircraft were released after Iran captured an RQ-170 in 2011.

Yep, I've been trying to get a handle on internal perspectives and conscription really is quite unpopular. Currently there are beliefs that Putin removed all conscripts after his announcement they were ""discovered"" there (and investigated ""disobedience"" of his orders not to use them), that Russian losses are due to orders to be as peaceful as possible to protect civilian life (unlike, say, Baghdad; the ""evidence"" here is that the cities aren't flattened), and Ukrainian citizens are indifferent to the war but the West is fuelling it with weapons (unpacking this, it's referring to Russian-separatist regions). Oh, and the invasion happened because Ukraine was supposedly about to strike Crimea the next day (why they would try such a thing when Russia has a force ready to invade a few kilometres away is anybody's guess).

So far, the best strategy I've found to respond to these is by outlining timelines (like the fact we knew of the invasion in advance, and we have historic records outlining the astroturfing campaign on social media to create the justification for invasion), and by making future predictions with the intent of showing that my information is accurate. The US Intel release was an absolute master play in fighting disinformation.

But I digress, my main point here is that conscription really is deeply unpopular, and citizens really don't know how poorly Russia is doing, or why. They don't understand that Ukrainian citizens are fighting to defend their country. Conscription is a terrible idea, but in the current form Putin is losing this war. Their only key tactical advantage is numbers. Even after recompressing their forces and better securing their logistics lines, they're still stalling and losing ground across the battlefield (and advancing in a few places), and Ukraine's army is modernising (god bless those Howitzers).

I'm also interested in mapping timelines to quantify Putin's escalations during nationalist pride moments (Olympics, Victory Day parades etc), to highlight the underlying narrative of deceit (and a projection of key dates).",False,1652063483.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7ve25l,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Namely, with normal satellite communications your signal is either going to be relatively consistently broadcast towards a singular satellite (which, in its high orbit is either functionally not moving [geostationary] or moving relatively slowly) or is an omnidirectional signal.

In both of those cases the ability to track the transceiver is relatively straightforward. Granted, in the case of the directional antenna for a geostationary satellite, you need to stumble across the beam, but since that beam isn't going to move at all, if you're in a helicopter and circle back you have a good chance of catching it.

With Starlink, it's beam is constantly shifting position to track the current satellite or shift to another one. As such, if the dish is under some form of camouflaged netting (particularly one good at blocking heat), it's actually quite hard from a technological sense to track it down.

 >Rashism or Ruscism (Russian: Рашизм, romanized: Rashizm, pronounced [rɐˈʂɨzm]; a portmanteau of ""Russia"" and ""fascism""; Ukrainian: рашизм, romanized: rashyzm), also known as Russism (Russian: Русизм), or Russian fascism, is a claim that Russia has been transformed into a fascist or neo-fascist country. It is also used for referring to the ideology of Russian military expansionism. That transformation was described as based on the ideas of the ""special civilizational mission"" of the Russians, such as Moscow as the third Rome and expansionism. This is also a claim widely used to identify supporters of Russian military aggression.

If anything, manpower wise on the ground, Ukraine has generally had an advantage (across the whole theatre). Ukraine's C3i has been amazing and has balanced their materiel disadvatage.

4b954d2569080147221f33fb85c8c702,uktnbc,i7vkqiq,"I mean, again - I have Asperger's myself. I basically have had to be taught social norms and mores, and I think some are incredibly stupid.

If I don't want to go to a wedding, and I hate the people involved... why do I need to go? Who cares if it's my stepsister getting married; I don't like her, I don't talk to her, yet people got really upset when I said I wasn't planning on attending. Why do I need to hide the fact that I dislike her as a person, just because my dad married her mom? It's incredibly stupid to me that I need to hide how I feel about things because society tells me to. So yes, I totally get where you're coming from.

But at the same time, some of these norms and mores exist for a reason. Like, publicly calling a diver a pedophile out of nowhere crosses a line, _especially_ if you have an army of fans who will go and harass that person.

To use your example, Elon's style of working _does_ work fantastically well in the short term. But in the long term, not everyone is biologically built like Elon.

To speak from personal experience: I can hyper-focus daily for 18 hours, no problem. I do not get burnt out and can repeatedly handle challenging problems, over and over again. I'm okay with eating the same thing every day, in a small room. I do not have urges to go outside or socialize or do anything beyond the problem directly in front of me.

Meanwhile, my fiance nearly went crazy within a month when the pandemic started, because she couldn't handle being trapped inside all day.

It comes down to the fact that I am not neurotypical; I'm physically biologically different from most people. Just because I can do things does not mean that the general public at large can. Elon, similarly, is also neurodivergent - he can handle things that others cannot. It is unfair to ask people to do things that they biologically cannot handle.

That then begs the question: why not sort people based on what they can do biologically? For someone who is technically oriented and doesn't fully understand social norms and mores, that makes perfect sense... never mind the fact that I essentially just described eugenics. And then we begin to understand why there is a social stigma against eugenics: because sorting people based on biological differences promotes racism and hatred.

To ensure an equitable environment, we cater to the ""average"" and neurodivergent types are the exception, not the rule.

I don't think envy has anything to do with why people dislike Elon. I think it has everything to do with the fact that he's simply inconsiderate of others, which again comes from that massive ""blind spot"" Asperger's gives him.

I'm frequently unintentionally offensive and brash in my personal life, and it's simply because social skills for me need to be learned and consciously exercised. If I were elevated to a global stage, I would probably attract similar haters because of it. I wouldn't say my ability to unintentionally hurt others is an advantage - perhaps my ability to hyper-focus is, but certainly not my inability to understand social mores.

I feel Elon is the same way - or at least, that's what makes logical sense as someone who has the same neurological disorder as him. Maybe I'm wrong. But I definitely don't think it's envy that drives his haters.",False,1652065750.0,t3_uktnbc,t1_i7vh5dj,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Ignoring “entry” training courses for new pilots in the US, once they’ve completed all those they effectively become “pilots” and move on to a basic course for whichever platform they will eventually be flying, this takes 9 months, this is where other pilots (IE Ukraine pilots, would start learning a new platform). There’s additional training afterwards for US pilots, but they may or may not be taken advantage of by Ukraine. 

I have no doubt there’s a world where the US could streamline these courses and possibly shorten them to an extent, but 2 months is a stretch. 

That’s not even the only issue, so what do you do next, do you pull all Ukrainian pilots off the line for several months of full time (key words there. There are only so many ways you could stream line any course) training during the height of the war. Surely you see the problem there. Given that this is an active war, at its height, you could realistically maybe get away with training a few at a time, and keep doing this until you’ve finally trained them all. That’s going to be a long time before they are all trained, or even a significant portion. For all we know a small number of pilots could already be undergoing training, but like I said, the fruits of this labor wouldn’t be seen for a WHILE.

But you don't have to believe that, I'm not claiming any expertise you are unaware of or sources not publicly available. You can take it or leave it, that's up to you.

It was stated about a month ago by US intel that there are no signs of China providing meaningful support to Russia. This assessment was confirmed again recently by the head of the CIA.

China is the most likely one who has the means and numbers of chips required to support Russia, they haven't as near as we can tell.

Most of those other countries don't want to either as they then are at risk of getting caught up in all the Allied sanctions.

If you pay attention to Chinese Business news, many of their big companies are pulling out or disengaging from Russia. It's not because CCP wants them to, it's because money made in the developed world vastly outmatches that in Russia.

So while Russia may be getting small numbers of components on the Black Market, there is no indication they are getting anything significant, above board.

And even if they are, their production numbers don't match their use-rate, which is why at last (conservative) estimates in April had them down to 25% of smart munitions left.
