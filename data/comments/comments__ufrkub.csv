In the winter of 1944 the German Wermacht launched a major counter offensive through the Ardennes forest in Belgium.  This offensive and the resulting allied counter attacks became know as ""The Battle of the Bulge"" do to the ""Bulge"" the initial German attacks made in allied lines.

During the Battle of the Bulge the most important position along the southern axis of German advance was the town of Bastogne in Belgium.  At Bastogne 6 roads through the thick Ardennes forest intersected.  

So, in response to the German offensive the Allies rushed the 101st Airborne infantry division and an armored brigade to Bastogne to prevent Germany from using the road network for resupply.  And while Bastogne would famously be surrounded and besieged, the forces holding Bastogne also effectively cutoff all German positions to their North, West and South.  Almost, two concurrent seiges.

During the attack on Kyiv the ""Bastogne"" of the Russian offensive was Ivankiv.  Which was only 30 KMs from acknowledged Ukrainian line while being 60 KMs from the furthest Russian advances toward Kyiv.  What likely triggered the Russian route from Kyiv were Ukrianians infiltration into the woods and forests near Ivankiv.

The ""Bastogne"" of the advance from Izyum is Kupiansk.  Kupiansk is about 60 KM cross country from Ukrainian lines near Kharkhiv and 100 KMs from Izyum.  

Kupiansk differs from Ivankiv in several important ways which make the current Russian advance significantly more secure than the Russian attack on Kyiv.  (1) the terrain is steppe/plain rather than forest, therefore isn't fundementally vulnerable to light infantry infiltration, (2) a major river anchors the Russian and Ukrainian lines in the AO, and (3) there aren't direct roads from Kupiansk along any notional axis of attack.

These difference mean that if Ukraine wanted to take Kupiansk they would probably have to launch their first major armored offensive of the war.  If Ukraine were to launch such an offensive their ""Bastogne""s would be Chuhuiv and Kharkhiv.

It's clear from reading both Jomini and the Institute for the Study of War, that they believe that the Ukrainian counter attacks around Kharkhiv are for the purpose of pushing the Russians across the river.  Securing the flank of a future offensive salient, likely in the direction of Kupiansk.",False,1651404008.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

You nailed it regarding some of the analytical shortcomings during this war. F/ex: The assumption that Putin and military leadership are acting ""rationally with set goals and understanding of deadlines"" is an example. Once the ""we'll take over in 3-4 days"" finishing date was exceeded, Putin and the military were not flexible enough to change strategies, or to reassess goals. Sure, they withdrew their wagon train from the road to Kiev, but that looks more like a retreat than anything that was planned. To this day they keep utilizing the same tactics,  and this has given Ukrainian forces an advantage.

The ""rumored May 9th general mobilization"" is a risky move for Putin, and one that he cannot walk back. Countless generals have met their fate on the battlefield, and my guess is that the military is starting to grumble. Conscription is akin to impressment gangs, and already that is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Quote:  
What is Kherson region important to Russian occupants?  
1. Transport connection and supply of everything necessary from Crimea to Russian troops in southern Ukraine. Two cars and two railway tracks lead from Crimea to Kherson Херini.  
2. The possibility of concentration of troops in Kherson region to continue the advance both towards Kryvyi Rih and Nikolaev-Odessa.  
3. Water for the Crimea. After the capture of the Kakhovsky GES already on February 24, the Russians received control over the Dniprovsk water in the Kakhovsky reservoir. The water after the temporary rowing went to Crimea. The Jankoy water actually comes by itself, then goes up by pumps.  
4. Grains and other products grown in the Kherson region. In February, the Russians defakto gained control not only over the North Crimean channel, but also over the Kakhov channel, which gives water to most of the southern Kherson region, and even supplies water to Berdyansk. Kherson region is an opportunity to receive products cheaply for Russian occupiers. So if at first the Russian occupiers were just robbing agricultural producers in Kherson region, then now they are forcing farmers to go into the field - sowing, etc. d.  
5. Agrarno-vodnaity of Russia's interests in Kherson also affects citizen policy. For agriculture and supply of water to Crimea do not need many people. More than that - people will even interfere. Therefore Russia will continue to do everything so that the people in Kherson region do not have work, money, communication and so on. This will encourage economically active people to leave the region.  
6. Another important moment - Kherson region is land on the coast of two seas. I won't be surprised if they already share land areas somewhere in Moscow.

  
So, the Russians themselves will not leave Kherson region. Just like they themselves have not left Crimea in 8 years. The only way to liberate Kherson region is the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",False,1651390873.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

By the power of the offensive - practically on all fronts and flanks - it is clear that a kind of ""Barbarossa"" plan has been put into action, involving both a blitzkrieg and a swift victory in it.
The details of the current battlefield, where Russia defends the values that are the essence of the national civilization, do matter. Just as the words spoken to formulate what the meaning and idea of today's clash of civilizations is.

Isn't that exactly how Nazi Germany pounced on the USSR in 1941, supported by dozens of European countries. Someone wittily called that gathering ""Hitler's EU"" in a modern manner. So it is.

At the time, the West had the intention of staging a coup, setting up a hot spot on the border with Russia, and then launching an offensive in Ukraine, which was prevented by our special operation.

I think that would make way more sense. He went to the frontlines to get a more accurate image of what's happening. Or maybe Moscow indeed had a skewed picture of what was going on and he wanted to see for himself. Perhaps what he's seen there is even completely different (i.e. way worse) then what got reported to him. 

So if that's indeed the case, I'm wondering if we're going to hear any policy changes in the coming days from Moscow. So far Putin seemed to believe that ultimately his army will prevail. What if Gerasimov now tells him ""Sorry Vlad, but I was there, and it's a clusterfuck.""?",False,1651410103.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Russia says it has shot down two Ukrainian bombers

Russia's defence ministry says its air defence systems shot down two Ukrainian Su-24m bombers over the Kharkiv region overnight, according to the Reuters news agency.

It also said it had struck at weapons supplied to Ukraine by the US and European countries and claimed to have destroyed a runway at a military airfield near the Ukrainian city of Odesa.

Alright, 1,026 tanks destroyed by Ukrainian forces.  That's destroyed. As in burned out hulks with their turrets 50 yards away and exploring a new career as a sunflower planter.  Now the thing about tanks is- they break down.  A lot.  They're not like cars where you need to get an oil change very 5,000 miles.  They're very heavily engineered, heavy duty equipment, with some surprisingly fragile parts.  It takes a huge effort to keep tanks running.  In good times with good logisitics it's a struggle to keep repairing them faster than they will break down.  That's even harder when tanks are being deployed and driving around hundreds of miles.  And when you're logistics are shit it becomes impossible.  So Russia is almost certainly losing huge numbers of tanks just from mechanical reasons.  

Then there's combat damage.  We've seen the clips of combat footage where one tank is destroyed by a direct hit, and the one next to it gets rocked on its suspension by the blast of near misses.  There's a pause, and then it slowly reverses away and escapes destruction.  So it doesn't end up a number of the list.  People consider it survived.  Yet it very probably is no longer combat operational.  Like wounded soldiers, they're no longer effective.   Sure the armor is intact, but you've probably got wounded crew members.  The optics could be outright destroyed.  The gun could be inoperable (they don't take wear and tear well, they're precision tools).

Of course we don't know the numbers of out of service tanks.  When it comes to casualties of soldiers, the wounded tend to outnumber the dead by three to four to one.  So the Russians have probably taken, ball park, a hundred thousand lost troops.  It's very probable the same sort of ratios apply to combat vehicles like tanks.  But let's be conservative, lets say the number of mechanically broke down, combat damaged, and outright destroyed tanks are 1:1:1.  That would mean that the Russians have lost about 3,000 tanks.  In a little over two months of fighting.  This is completely unsustainable, and the same basic prinicple is applying to everything else on this list.  

I think there's a good reason analysts are predicting the total collapse of the russian army within weeks, and it's not some complex analysis, it's just basic math.  It explains a lot of other behavior too, like NATO now rushing heavy weaponry to Ukraine without worry of consequences.  Or oil dependent countries happily putting embargos on oil.

I think an internal Russian thing that people in the west don't really seem to grasp well is that Putin is seen as an anti corruption force.  For example, an average Russian boomer would say ""All of the government officials are corrupt and the only thing holding them in line and keeping the government functioning is Putin"" 

So Putin has this amazingly ready built excuse for a lot of things.  Incompetence in the military is within what people expect, so as long as Putin punishes them after the fact then he's seen as a savior of sorts. 

Putin's public appearances also support this.  The only thing he's publicly been seen doing is signing an order to start the special military operation, and recognize Luhansk and Donetesk as independent nations. Any other failure can be foisted off on some generals, which he has done several times now, and any success he can claim as his.

1.  Ukraine loses:   champagne and caviar.

2.  Stalemate:  spin it as ""Nato intervened"", foment hate against NATO, propaganda path out of this.  And with less to go around, we can expect a thinning of the herd amongst the elite:  a few heads will roll, ceremoniously.  Life sucks as an ordinary Russian, but that's the way it's always been.  

3.  Ukraine wins:  Again, heads roll, and it becomes a game of not being in the group whose heads roll.  

So the powers that be will: expose the necks of others in case #3 happens, hope for #1, and participate actively and supportively in all efforts to throw resources at #1 on the path to #2, lest theirs is the head that rolls.

In other word, Russia is going to throw every expendable person at this, until a faction within the power-class decides whose heads roll.

For the nuclear-doomers quivering under their tables and clutching iodine pills, no the thought of Ukraine winning will *not* trigger a nuclear holocaust, because the smart people know that the minute something unthinkable is unleashed, the entirety of Russia will be obliterated. It's equivalent to heads will roll, but instead of devolving into a game of whose head rolls (and the knives come out), it will be everyone's heads.",False,1651417631.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6wl9ak,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Parkinson's Disease: Putin could remain in power with Parkinson's.

Schizoaffective disorder: I'd be careful with this one as a firm diagnosis. Note that the description in the article is a bit of a ""catch all."" This stated, it could be simply an explanation for Putin's illogical and erratic behavior.

But this whole idea of 'off-ramps' is simply, horseshit.

The concept itself isn't, but applying it to Putin is.

It's a term used to save face in negotiations when you take a geopolitical decision back home to your people.

Putin can manufacture whatever stroy he wants for whatever reason to justify whatever decision, he subsequently doesn't need off-ramps.

He demonstrated early on that his intent was eliminating Ukraine as a free nation, the South and East are merely step-backed versions of that initial idea.

He doesn't care about NATO expansion, he just wants to be able to use violence as a weapon to bully his neighbours.

He only mildly cares about the oil and gas prospects for Ukraine in the Black Sea, its an added bonus.

Putin has wanted Ukraine either as a puppet or as part of Russia for decades, he's been saying it... For decades.

The only thing the West needs to consider in this entire spectrum of war is not to directly engage in hostile, violent action against Russia. This isn't just about Nuclear War, in fact that's a factor but not the primary one. It's about the narrative and perception.

What they are saying is that the Russians are not achieving their goals, that the current offensive is likely (not certainly) to peter out in the coming weeks, which then allows opportunity for counterattacks from the Ukrainian side.

Additionally, on the southern front it appears the Russians are gearing up for another push/offensive, so it's unclear how it will go there. All together, we're essentially at the same place we were 6 weeks ago: from publicly available information it appears Ukrainians are holding their own and have chances to counterattack. We have not seen those counter attacks materialize yet (which makes sense as the Russians are expending a lot of resources now to attack) so it's not possible to say how those end up.

All in all, much remains unclear and there is a lot of fog of war. The good news is that the Ukrainians appear to be holding this more dedicated offensive, which you could count as a ""win"", for sure. But obviously if the front line doesn't move from here, the Ukrainians would still have lost a great deal of territory.

But instead of only suffocating them, the West should make it more explicit that it can all end very quickly if Russia wants it. The sanctions aren't meant to be eternal and unconditional. There are specific and entirely realistic actions that Russia can take to make them end.

For example, EU leaders could tell Russia that if it ends the war and withdraws from all Ukrainian territory, it will lift sanctions related to energy, and will Russia will be invited to negotiotate with Western leaders on what will happen with the rest of sanctions and what it will take to remove them.

 >The Gerasimov Doctrine, named after the Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Valery Gerasimov, is a foreign policy doctrine. The doctrine redefines the modern concept of interstate conflict and warfare puts it on a par with political, economic, informational, humanitarian and other non-military activities. The doctrine became known after its publication in February 2013 and the subsequent actions of Russia in relation to Ukraine, which fully coincide with the theses of this doctrine. According to a number of researchers, the key elements of the Gerasimov Doctrine underlie the concept of New Generation Warfare.

Bold opening for someone who then continues on to say something incorrect. Multiple observers have stated that Ukraine is getting to the point where they can start forming new BTG's based from their territorial defense forces using the incoming NATO equipment, whose position will be taken over by their current reserves. Fact is the reserve power of Ukraine currently is a lot larger than that of Russia, and Ukraine is having to turn away people while Russia is having a hard time finding people.

Ukraine is currently limited by equipment whereas Russia is limited by people. Certainly that doesn't mean that the Ukrainian reserves or territorial defense forces are immediately crack soldiers, but they are months ahead in the recruitment and training curve of Russia at least. Their territorial defense force has additionally proven surprisingly stiff and as a defensive force proven in good condition.

It’s not even like the Russian military has a leg to stand, from the reports/articles I’ve personally seen, the story forming or being told is that Russian military high command are essentially blaming all of their failures on the FSB, and I have no doubt the FSB carries a lot of responsibility here, but it’s not as of the military has been a floundering mess during the entire invasion.

Get your head out of Hollywood bullshit and think about the logistics of this.

Drones need to carry battery-packs to fly, and Drones need radio to talk back to base. This limits you to a few things:

1. Lithium-ion power packs -- heavier, slower, weaker than gunpowder based propulsion. Artillery and Mortar can travel further because they use highly-efficient and lightweight gunpowder to travel wherever they want on the battlefield. In contrast, Li-ion is expensive, heavy, and has far less power.

2. Radio -- If that drone needs a video feed, you need to be within line-of-sight of the drone. Your radio needs to be in contact with the drone. For all of these drone videos you're watching, someone is controlling it, and they're probably nearby.

3. Electronic Warfare -- If that radio signal is tracked, the enemy can shell you or mortar you back.

4. Weight -- 500 drones will weigh more than 500 mortar rounds and deliver far less than the explosive capability of those mortar rounds, let alone artillery.

> Drones are the future. 

Sure. But not in stupid capacities. You gotta use them effectively as weapons. Drones seem really good as scouting, and suicide drones don't ""return to sender"", so there's nothing to track back. Still though, I wouldn't want to be the one holding a drone-radio on the frontlines, especially with modern EM detectors and radio-seeking missiles that exist.

There's a real risk to using drones on the frontlines. You're carrying far less explosives or ""power"" compared to a mortarman or artillery man whenever you carry a drone. You aren't going to be beating those weapon-systems in terms of brute force.

The biggest thing drone-warfare offers is intelligence, particularly as a form of scouting.",1651393367.0,1651392521.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6vsytn,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Modern artillery can shoot over-the-horizon. Drones cannot leave radio-contact from their operator, which means the horizon is as far as they can go. (Once the curvature of the Earth ""blocks"" the radio signal, you can't control the drone anymore).

There's also the issue of electronic-warfare / jamming. Since drones are a video-feed, it doesn't take very much to degrade that signal.

--------

I'd expect that drones would be a tool for forward-operators, who would still have to radio-back to the artillery team where to shoot. Forward-operators can use lower frequency radio bands to ""reflect"" off of the atmosphere and send messages over the horizon (but only morse-code and voice are low-bandwidth enough for those radio bands).

I'd expect drone operators (especially the video-feed) to all be within higher-frequencies (and therefore will never ""reflect"" off the atmosphere, but instead just continue out into space. That's just physics unfortunately, if you want high-bandwidth you have to deal with these issues).

That being said: the forward-operator could use a drone and possibly be in a more-hidden position. Forward operator can still guide artillery through voice-calls over lower-frequency radio, and it'd be harder to jam as well.",1651395638.0,1651394896.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6vsdqn,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

However, if it is ""you can choose between getting raped by Russian soldiers or working low wage jobs and spending your earnings in the company store"" the choice to work the low wages is not really a free choice.  

It is hard to imagine that people living in Sevastopol will have an improved quality of life if tbe city is razed while Ukraine is evicting the Russians.  

Right now Ukrainians sound pissed off and fighty.  We saw that on a large scale in USA in 2001.  Anti-war was a small minority, I saw 9% in a CNN poll. A decade later a majority wanted Afghanistan to be over.  Once Ukraine establishes security they will be less eager to throw lives into a meat grinder.  The question is ""how much less"".  There should be zero pressure from Washington to either settle or continue.  That lack of pressure should be stated clearly too.

In WWII we had a ""no separate peace"" agreement among USSR, USA, and UK.  No such agreement exists and it should not exist in this situation. The status of Donbas and Crimea is completely outside of USA and UK's sphere of influence.  The people in Donbas are Ukrainian.  They may not appreciate a rolling barrage of NATO heavy artillery as much as people in Kyiv do.

Now, if Putin wants to somehow claim victory in Ukraine by holding onto Dombass or the other territory, then sanctions will continue, pretty much forever, unless Ukraine decides to end this, which I very much doubt unless Putin achieves large gains in Eastern Ukraine soon and can hold them (big if).

There is a daily updated map that shows the current locations of all battalions and brigades of Ukraine. I can assure you that Ukraine has nothing left to field, everything is accounted for.

There is a big difference between the regular army, the one that has already 8 years of fighting experience in the Donbass, and the rest.

Russia has primarily fought low level insurgencies with brutal force while the US relied on a hearts and minds campaign that some can argue wasn’t as successful due to cultural differences and American attitudes.

Artillery requires having equipment in place that can be destroyed and having your soldiers in danger and with lesser mobility. A drone pilot can take someone out from a bathroom a few km away and further if relays are in place. 

The biggest weaknesses are the possibility of your drone being hijacked, its relatively low speed of travel, and the possibility of its signals being jammed.

Ignoring that reality doesn’t make it a non issue. 

That is not to say that in a world where NATO troops inevitably find their way into Ukraine, and simply fight to restore Ukraine’s borders, that this automatically leads to WW3/nuclear Holocaust, although it certainly increases the odds.

Well now I know you're bullshitting me, because you drones absolutely won't be replacing a fucking truck. Think about what you're saying.

Delivering 2 hand grenades over the course of a 30-minute flight is really fucking dumb. Be it delivering them to the enemy, or delivering them to soldiers who will then use the grenades. Its better to pack that shit into a truck and drive it over in almost all possible circumstances.

There's no ""drone"" technology available that automates deliveries yet. And if there were, they'd be less efficient than ground transportation thanks to fundamental physics (unless you think self-driving cars would be considered drones, but I severely doubt that). There are some hard, fundamental AI problems btw associated with self-driving technologies, which drones also have to deal with if you ever want to cut that radio-link.

> They'll have hive behaviour.

We already have hiving cruise missiles yo. Welcome to like 10 years ago. Whatever you think fucking quadcopters can do, I guarantee you that a rocket does it faster and therefore better in most circumstances.

The only reason why quadcopters / drones are being used, is because sometimes we want a ""slower"" weapon, the ""loitering"" concept (wait over the battlefield and fire at a later time). But if you knew enemies were in the area already, just shoot them with a simpler rocket attack at 500mph (subsonic), 1000mph (supersonic), or 3000mph (hypersonic) and skip the 30-minute flight time of a 50mph drone.

That 'loitering' is interesting and useful, especially for scouting (going somewhere before you knew where the enemy was). But once you find the enemy, the name of the game is to deliver as many explosives to the enemy as cheaply, quickly, and accurately as possible.

1. Dropping grenades isn't very accurate. Drones don't carry much weight.

2. Suicide attacks occur at 100mph with Switchblade drones. They're remarkably slower than artillery (1000mph).

You also have a girlfriend that goes to another school so we wouldn't know her? Get the fuck out of here with your appeal to authority fallacy bullshit.

Mate - nobody is arguing that the regulars are the highest quality and can easily be replaced. The point here is that you multiple times missed the whole existence of the TDF and structured your entire argument around the reserves. For someone who professes to be so ""in the know"" that certainly seems a little bit odd, wouldn't you say?

And just because TDF != regulars, doesn't mean that Ukraine can't form new BTG's from there. Yes, the quality will be lower, but the Russians are having the exact same issue but worse, since they don't have a TDF but have to fall back on conscripts and reserves immediately.

This again doesn't speak overall to the general issues of manpower, where both sides are degrading their top tier army but Ukraine has easier access to replacements than Russia.

Drones will be used in so many ways you obviously cannot imagine if you don't even know how they're being used now, rigged up on the fly.


Drones btw are being used to deliver payloads many hundreds of lbs and at distances of hundreds of km, in areas where trucks can't get to, at speeds much faster than trucks ever could even if there were roads, in areas all over the world in trials for civilian reasons. I know this because assessing this stuff is part of what I do for a living. 

So anyhow... enjoy your ignorance.",1651396349.0,1651396073.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6vw3vi,,8,3,0,3,0,0,

They do take the nuke threat seriously. It's just the U.S. is not making public statements about changing the forces readiness levels and such.

The U.S. take the threat seriously enough, like a month, month and a half ago? They cancelled a schedule ICBM test because they did not want to appear provacative. There is a difference in providing arms to a country that happens to be at war, and being provacative by certain actions.

In the real world where we are cancelling missile tests because of the russian nuclear threat, we are taking them seriously.",False,1651410905.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6wedr4,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

He clearly doesn’t have any concept of what drones are capable of when he indicated you had to have line if sight of your drone to fly it. He’s just making it up as he goes. An army of drones each equipped with a machine gun and flying around shooting any human target that has a heat signature or moves is absolutely terrifying. And could take zero operators. 

Artillery is still a powerful weapon but drones allow you to win by outspending your opponent particularly in urban warfare. And yeah, a targeted grenade on a vehicle or personnel? Yes, the artillery would be much more impactful but it will also crater the road etc. Sometimes you don’t want to cause extreme collateral damage. Like if it’s your road and the properties of your people when you are being invaded, perhaps. 

Sometimes you just blow it all up because you need to. But if you can just drop a grenade from a 400$ drone? 

Not only that, it makes ALL drones scary for an enemy. Even unarmed ones. Imagine scaring away a tank battalion with 15 unarmed 500$ drones. It’s incredibly effective.",False,1651424798.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6vxuu0,,9,0,0,0,0,0,

Do bullets leave smoke trails?

A mortar is basically just a bullet that launches upwards, instead of sideways. Same with artillery.

The way counter-artillery radar works, is that you use radar to see fast-moving objects (like artillery shells) and reverse-triangulate them back to their origin point. But if you've got expensive electronic-equipment for tracking, you can almost certainly just follow back the radio-signals that are commanding a drone and trace that back to the origin as well.",False,1651422573.0,t3_ufrkub,t1_i6vztyd,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
