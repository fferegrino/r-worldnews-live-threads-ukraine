In the winter of 1944 the German Wermacht launched a major counter offensive through the Ardennes forest in Belgium.  This offensive and the resulting allied counter attacks became know as ""The Battle of the Bulge"" do to the ""Bulge"" the initial German attacks made in allied lines.

During the Battle of the Bulge the most important position along the southern axis of German advance was the town of Bastogne in Belgium.  At Bastogne 6 roads through the thick Ardennes forest intersected.  

So, in response to the German offensive the Allies rushed the 101st Airborne infantry division and an armored brigade to Bastogne to prevent Germany from using the road network for resupply.  And while Bastogne would famously be surrounded and besieged, the forces holding Bastogne also effectively cutoff all German positions to their North, West and South.  Almost, two concurrent seiges.

During the attack on Kyiv the ""Bastogne"" of the Russian offensive was Ivankiv.  Which was only 30 KMs from acknowledged Ukrainian line while being 60 KMs from the furthest Russian advances toward Kyiv.  What likely triggered the Russian route from Kyiv were Ukrianians infiltration into the woods and forests near Ivankiv.

The ""Bastogne"" of the advance from Izyum is Kupiansk.  Kupiansk is about 60 KM cross country from Ukrainian lines near Kharkhiv and 100 KMs from Izyum.  

Kupiansk differs from Ivankiv in several important ways which make the current Russian advance significantly more secure than the Russian attack on Kyiv.  (1) the terrain is steppe/plain rather than forest, therefore isn't fundementally vulnerable to light infantry infiltration, (2) a major river anchors the Russian and Ukrainian lines in the AO, and (3) there aren't direct roads from Kupiansk along any notional axis of attack.

These difference mean that if Ukraine wanted to take Kupiansk they would probably have to launch their first major armored offensive of the war.  If Ukraine were to launch such an offensive their ""Bastogne""s would be Chuhuiv and Kharkhiv.

It's clear from reading both Jomini and the Institute for the Study of War, that they believe that the Ukrainian counter attacks around Kharkhiv are for the purpose of pushing the Russians across the river.  Securing the flank of a future offensive salient, likely in the direction of Kupiansk.",False,1651404008.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

You nailed it regarding some of the analytical shortcomings during this war. F/ex: The assumption that Putin and military leadership are acting ""rationally with set goals and understanding of deadlines"" is an example. Once the ""we'll take over in 3-4 days"" finishing date was exceeded, Putin and the military were not flexible enough to change strategies, or to reassess goals. Sure, they withdrew their wagon train from the road to Kiev, but that looks more like a retreat than anything that was planned. To this day they keep utilizing the same tactics,  and this has given Ukrainian forces an advantage.

The ""rumored May 9th general mobilization"" is a risky move for Putin, and one that he cannot walk back. Countless generals have met their fate on the battlefield, and my guess is that the military is starting to grumble. Conscription is akin to impressment gangs, and already that is scraping the bottom of the barrel.

Quote:  
What is Kherson region important to Russian occupants?  
1. Transport connection and supply of everything necessary from Crimea to Russian troops in southern Ukraine. Two cars and two railway tracks lead from Crimea to Kherson Херini.  
2. The possibility of concentration of troops in Kherson region to continue the advance both towards Kryvyi Rih and Nikolaev-Odessa.  
3. Water for the Crimea. After the capture of the Kakhovsky GES already on February 24, the Russians received control over the Dniprovsk water in the Kakhovsky reservoir. The water after the temporary rowing went to Crimea. The Jankoy water actually comes by itself, then goes up by pumps.  
4. Grains and other products grown in the Kherson region. In February, the Russians defakto gained control not only over the North Crimean channel, but also over the Kakhov channel, which gives water to most of the southern Kherson region, and even supplies water to Berdyansk. Kherson region is an opportunity to receive products cheaply for Russian occupiers. So if at first the Russian occupiers were just robbing agricultural producers in Kherson region, then now they are forcing farmers to go into the field - sowing, etc. d.  
5. Agrarno-vodnaity of Russia's interests in Kherson also affects citizen policy. For agriculture and supply of water to Crimea do not need many people. More than that - people will even interfere. Therefore Russia will continue to do everything so that the people in Kherson region do not have work, money, communication and so on. This will encourage economically active people to leave the region.  
6. Another important moment - Kherson region is land on the coast of two seas. I won't be surprised if they already share land areas somewhere in Moscow.

  
So, the Russians themselves will not leave Kherson region. Just like they themselves have not left Crimea in 8 years. The only way to liberate Kherson region is the actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",False,1651390873.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

By the power of the offensive - practically on all fronts and flanks - it is clear that a kind of ""Barbarossa"" plan has been put into action, involving both a blitzkrieg and a swift victory in it.
The details of the current battlefield, where Russia defends the values that are the essence of the national civilization, do matter. Just as the words spoken to formulate what the meaning and idea of today's clash of civilizations is.

Isn't that exactly how Nazi Germany pounced on the USSR in 1941, supported by dozens of European countries. Someone wittily called that gathering ""Hitler's EU"" in a modern manner. So it is.

At the time, the West had the intention of staging a coup, setting up a hot spot on the border with Russia, and then launching an offensive in Ukraine, which was prevented by our special operation. The current behavior of some representatives of Kazakhstan's elite is upsetting because Astana is choosing the wrong side and not quite adequately assessing the situation.

I think that would make way more sense. He went to the frontlines to get a more accurate image of what's happening. Or maybe Moscow indeed had a skewed picture of what was going on and he wanted to see for himself. Perhaps what he's seen there is even completely different (i.e. way worse) then what got reported to him. 

So if that's indeed the case, I'm wondering if we're going to hear any policy changes in the coming days from Moscow. So far Putin seemed to believe that ultimately his army will prevail. What if Gerasimov now tells him ""Sorry Vlad, but I was there, and it's a clusterfuck.""?",False,1651410103.0,t3_ufrkub,t3_ufrkub,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

I think an internal Russian thing that people in the west don't really seem to grasp well is that Putin is seen as an anti corruption force.  For example, an average Russian boomer would say ""All of the government officials are corrupt and the only thing holding them in line and keeping the government functioning is Putin"" 

So Putin has this amazingly ready built excuse for a lot of things.  Incompetence in the military is within what people expect, so as long as Putin punishes them after the fact then he's seen as a savior of sorts. 

Putin's public appearances also support this.  The only thing he's publicly been seen doing is signing an order to start the special military operation, and recognize Luhansk and Donetesk as independent nations. Any other failure can be foisted off on some generals, which he has done several times now, and any success he can claim as his.
