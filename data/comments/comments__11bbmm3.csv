https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU0resswOds

28 min interview with Jeffery Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management. I found the whole thing fascinating and encourage everyone to watch it; here's some choice quotes to entice you:

[2:30] Is Russia weathering the sanctions?
> No. [...] You're repeating credible sources, but they've been completely duped. [...] Since the last time we spoke, Rosstat has had a change of leadership three times, until they found apparatchiks who will do Putin's bidding. [...] The reason Putin has survived economically are lies: He wakes up in the morning, picks a GDP number, puts it out there, then the IMF and World Bank canonize it.

[8:58] On Putin's annual speech:
> He wants to reassure his increasingly anxious population that's experiencing record unemployment and massive wartime debts [...] He thinks it's a war of attrition he can win by convincing the rest of the world that their efforts are not succeeding. They are succeeding: we know that he's losing half a billion dollars a day on energy.

[10:32] Is the ruble going up in value against the dollar?
> No, it's another fake number. There is no one you could put on your show who could tell you they've traded the ruble. It's not an exchange-traded currency. [...] There's not even a black market in rubles.

[18:10] On Western companies pulling out of the Russian market:
> This is one case where doing the right thing is rewarded financially. [...] For example, Royal Dutch Shell or BP or Exxon, they shut down completely and immediately -- BP wrote down 90 billion dollars right away -- and what happened? They were rewarded enormously, almost 2.5 times over, in the financial markets. [...] It's hard to do business in Russia right now, it's not the smart place to be. They have trouble paying people, they have trouble getting parts, they have trouble getting paid, let alone the cost of their corporate character. Companies like Heineken, Unilever, or Philips -- it's bewildering that they're still there.

[20:14] On oil+gas exports:
> If there's anything that's been more effective than Kyiv defending itself, it has been the full-frontal assault on Russia's energy business. [...] Russia is in no way an economic superpower in the world. Their economy used to be smaller than Italy; it's smaller than Chile now.

> In terms of Russia's oil: we would like India and China to buy more of it! It's so cheap. The G7 have all encouraged a 60 dollar price cap, because that's where Russia is just about to break even. Right now Russia is losing on every barrel that they produce: it costs 45 or 46 dollars per barrel to extract it -- it costs the Saudis only 22 dollars, and most other OPEC nations only 25 dollars a barrel.

[25:48] On human capital flight:
> It's a conservative estimate that 3 million highly sophisticated Russians have fled the country. [...] I just had a meeting with the ambassador from Uzbekistan, and they have almost half a million people from Russia, sophisticated IT professionals [...] so we've not just seen no capital going into Russia, but there's nothing that Russia sells on the world marketplace other than raw materials.

[26:47] On the PaRtNeRsHiP wItHoUt LiMiTs:
> All they had was food, fuel, and metals -- we now have alternate sources for all those commodities. They were like an economy in a mercantile system, and they're becoming perhaps a vassal state to China. What we're seeing, despite the headlines from China right now, is that China doesn't mind tapping Russia for its resources but they too realize they don't need Putin. Nobody in the world needs Russia, but it's fine if China and India use Russia for sourcing and keep global market prices down a bit, because Russia is making no money on anything they sell. ~~Russia~~ [note: I assume he misspoke and meant China] and India, which are not signatories to the price caps, they're benefitting from them. They're riding the coattails 'cause they have no interest in paying more to Putin either.",1677336851.0,1677336556.0,t3_11bbmm3,t3_11bbmm3,,0,102,0,102,0,0,

*Side Note*: This is important because it’s likely he ***visited to evaluate whether would organize an orderly withdrawal, or continue to fight***.  The fact that the military statement was “he listened to problematic issues, provided assistance in solving them,” then it seems likely that inclined to remain and continue fighting there.

Ukrainian milblogger Myroshnykov reported, 9pm (local time):

> Bakhmut 

> The situation in the **north** remains critical. The enemy is advancing, slowly.  For now, our guys are only able to slow them down. The enemy threw too many forces here. 

> [**West**:] The Russians are trying to enter the T0504 route—again—between Ivanovsky and Stupochky. The road has been under fire for a long time, but the enemy wants to establish physical control over it, to advance further, in order to merge with the group operating in the Berkhivka-Yagidny area. The enemy did not advance there today, but also, our Defense Forces weren’t able to execute any deep counterattacks. But little by little we are regaining control, over certain positions.

> On the **eastern** side, the enemy had a little success: they advanced even further to the west. Gradually, our forces were pushed out of the eastern bank of Bakhmutka, unfortunately.

> Generally, the situation is very dangerous. The enemy's breakthrough in the north is not stopped. It poses a threat to the entire city. 

> The occupiers have begun to withdraw their reserves from other areas in order to capture Bakhmut. The anniversary passed, after all, and they do not control the city completely. They put everything in order to capture Bakhmut. 

> Bakhmut holds on! Our soldiers create real miracles every day!💪

There are reports that Prigozhin claims Wagner captured villages north of Bakhmut—Berkhivka and Yagidny.  Western press points out that Ukraine does not verify this.  However, yesterday, the Ukrainian milblogger covering Bakhmut, Myroshnykov, **did announce this in his end-of-day report they’d been captured**.  I [posted it here](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11aiqnv/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/j9w7f77/).  He stressed that this loss directly threatens all of Bakhmut.

Although I think it's a bad play from an overall business perspective, and morally bankrupt of course, they're still in Russia because they think if they can maintain a foothold until the war is over they'll be well placed to profit afterwards. Most companies don't care about morals if they think there might be money to be made. They think they can take the PR hit for now and probably envision that being one of the few Western companies left will get them very favorable treatment from the Russian government trying to rebuild the postwar economy.

These companies can go fuck themselves of course but I think it's pretty obvious why they're still there, it's not costing them enough to stay in terms of PR and cash for them to want to lose even more money today by leaving and they hope to make more money in the future. If things get worse in Russia or the pressure from outside gets too much maybe they go, until then since they don't care about the lives lost they're staying.

On the other hand, the Russian Navy has always been several steps below awful. That's neither new nor surprising. ""Russian Navy continues to be terrible"" is a nonevent as far as naval analysts are concerned, because it is exactly in keeping with all of their past performance for decades.

Plenty of very famous and embarrassing defeats of the Imperial Russian Navy exist and throughout the entirety of the existence of the USSR, the Navy was pretty bad. Truthfully, it was never a key focus of Russian/Soviet plans for power projection - they've always been a land based nation when it comes to waging war, with the navy as a bonus extra. Think about how many countries they border (or historically bordered) and you can see why.

The USA on the other hand, has precisely two neighbours and is surrounded on both sides by the two largest bodies of water on the planet. To get its army anywhere else, and to support that army, a good navy was a prerequisite. Same goes for the UK, and Japan up until 1945, both are island nations that depended upon naval power to get anything done.

> According to General Viktor Nazarov, an advisor to the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian army, the HIMARS multiple missile launcher system has replaced the Turkish drones to some extent.

It used to be said during those days that ""Russia controls only the roads they drive on"". Their army would move forward, but behind that supply convoys would get attacked by Ukrainians. Deploying AA is difficult in those positions. Your frontline moves forward, so the AA has to move forward as well if it wants to be useful. Or you leave it behind, where it is vulnerable because the supplylines aren't secured yet.

E.g. while the Russian army was besieging Kyiv, a city like Chernihiv or Sumy was simply surrounded and bypassed. And many surrounding villages not even surrounded, just by-passed.

Compare that chaotic frontline, where battles could happen anywhere between Kyiv and the Ukraine border, to the current frontline. All along the current frontline trenches have been established, and the frontline is an actual continuous line. These lines are far more static, and if you set up AA behind the frontline, you can be quite sure it'll stay safe unless the frontline completely breaks.

such a static frontline with stable AA is a completely different(worse) environment for a Bayraktar to fight in compared to the fluid chaos of the first weeks, where an AA system would also be a sitting duck and prime target by itself. And worse, the AA systems would be moving on the road as well to bring them to the front, at which time it was even more perfect to strike them.",False,1677335644.0,t3_11bbmm3,t1_j9yg285,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

They were highly effective early on when Russian forces hadn't anticipated much if any resistance and had few AA systems deployed. They were also effective when the Russians didn't really know how to counter them.

Then the Russians used the videos to study operational tactics, brought in extra AA, and a bunch of Bayraktars went down, so Ukraine stopped posting footage from them but also curtailed their use. This dropoff also aligned with when Ukraine got HIMARS, which have similar capabilities in terms of range and accuracy but are much harder to intercept.

The Bayraktars are still around but aren't the super-killer they were in March 2022, their use is less prominently advertised and they're also mostly working in ""quieter"" areas where they are less vulnerable.

Whether they do or not the Bradley does have the ability to fire accurately on the move which the vast majority of Russia infantry fighting vehicles lack, which is huge, and they also will have better sensors especially in terms of infrared cameras which many Russian vehicles lack.

In addition the Bradley is designed to be able to take hits from up to 30 mm autocannons which is what most Russian infantry fighting vehicles are armed with. However a BMP *cannot* take hits from the bushmaster 25 mm on the Bradley. Also Bradley's have TOW ATGM's to take out tanks and although they can fire them it seems that most Russian BMP or BMD's are not armed with ATGM's. The M2 can not take a hit from the main gun of a tank but it can kill them with a TOW.

So the Bradley has a better chance of seeing the enemy first, can fire more accurately and while moving and can withstand a few hits from the Russian armored vehicles it is most likely to see which are armed with a 30 mm autocannon but should be able to penetrate them in return. It can also kill tanks with its TOW missiles although it is very vulnerable to them. I hope they give the Ukrainian's the ability to use it's combat information network to pass data along but even without that it is a clear step above the infantry fighting vehicles the Russian's field and what Ukraine currently has.

1. Russia launches bludgeoning frontal attacks against Ukrainian prepared positions to attempt to grind Ukrainian forces down. 

2. Russia gradually, painfully gains small amounts of ground, at huge cost. 

3. Russian morale bottoms out, as front line troops die in droves, equipment fails to arrive, etc. 

4. Foreign observers assume that this will go on forever and result eventually in Ukrainian defeat or forced stalemate, as Ukraine appears to be slowly losing ground. 

5. Ukraine launches counterattack at Russian weak points, liberating large amounts of Ukrainian territory and crushing weakened Russian formations. 

6. Foreign observers assume Russia is finished, and Ukraine will drive for the borders.

Lots of deliberation goes into deciding what equipment to supply Ukraine with equipment. We have to keep Ukraine's goals in mind - they need equipment to conduct the combined arms assaults they will need to retake their territory, while continuing the attrit the Russian numerical superiority in artillery and armour.

This is why Ukraine's received large amounts of artillery ammunition and systems such as HIMARS, which suppress Russian artillery and fires and force them to spread out ammo depots and manpower; why they're receiving large amounts of tanks and IFVs which will be necessary for combined arms purposes; and why thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are currently training in Western countries to use this equipment to the greatest effect. The only major missing piece of the puzzle are long-ranged strike capabilities like ATACMs as you mentioned. 

However, F-16s are not a key component of this. The Soviets, in response to US/NATO superiority in aircraft, compensated by building large quantities air defense systems. It's unclear but probable that S-300s/400s and BVR air-to-air missiles such as R-37s are capable of taking down F-16s. Usually, US doctrine relies on destruction of said systems beforehand with precision fires (SEAD/DEAD), and disruption of BVR capabilities with EW, but Ukraine does not have the superiority in either required to leverage. To quote u\/jrex035 on r/CredibleDefense:

> That's definitely part of it, but not the only part.

> Ukraine can't operate its airforce at medium to high altitude because of Russian air defense systems and longrange A2A missiles.

> Even if you gave Ukraine 50 F-16s, they don't just magically fix those issues. SEAD/DEAD is essential for Ukraine to be able to operate its airforce effectively, but its a) incredibly difficult to perform those roles (theres a reason why Russia isnt able to suppress Ukrainian ADS), b) its extremely costly in terms of pilots, airframes, and munitions, c) it takes a very long time and lots of training to perform it decently, let alone proficiently, and d) F-16s aren't the best aircraft for this role.

> Even the USAF, the undisputed world champions of SEAD/DEAD, would have some trouble with Russian air defenses despite having stealth aircraft, copious amounts of training, dedicated SEAD/DEAD units, more advanced munitions, and tons of experience, so there's little chance that the Ukrainian airforce could be trained to perform such tasks even decently well without many more years of training and tons of Western support.

> That's why Western aircraft really don't matter much, and considering their high cost, that money would definitely be better spent elsewhere.

I think Michael Kofman stated roughly what I and the other commenter just said, on the [Geopolitics Decanted](https://geopolitics-decanted.simplecast.com/episodes/how-russias-winter-offensive-could-backfire) podcast.

Yes, it is true that Ukraine needs aircraft to replace its own losses. However, there are viable ways to achieve this without sending Ukraine F-16s. For instance, F-16s and similar could be supplied to countries that retain their own Soviet jet stocks, freeing them up to send their equipment to Ukraine. This would have the added benefit of not requiring months of training on F-16s, and are a lot more cost-effective as well.

Meanwhile, we see Ukraine shelling southern occupied territories with new 150 km ranged ordinance, blasting apart huge ammo stockpiles and softening the region for probable spring offensive. An offense that may unlock an entire region. Not just a village here or there. People just need to look at where Russia is devoting its energies vs Ukraine to see which way the war is really going.

My conspiracy theory is Ukraine was ready for Bakhmut to fall weeks ago but left more troops in longer than they anticipated only because Russia was so wildly irresponsible with its own troops.

However, on a personal level from an ideology standpoint, I have never held much love for Elon Musk. I never really knew why, but he just sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I always felt he was phony and high on his own supply of self. He branded himself as a different kind of rich guy, a rich guy for the people, but was sort of found out. 

I don't feel any satisfaction that my instincts proved true, at least to me, because he truly has a lot to offer the world, but he's out for himself, just like the rest of them. Oh sure, there's philanthropy and tax write-offs. I may be alone in this, but I fail to see why an individual needs 100 billion dollars when half the world can't feed itself. Could at least pay some taxes here and there.

It's far from just Musk. The disease of greed is a pandemic, and chaos is a ladder. There is simply no denying that profits rule above all else. There's an oil crisis, not for oil companies. Americans are afraid to even go to the hospital because they may be wiped out by the cost, but big pharma retains a war chest to fight any and all comers. These are just the first world problems, let alone the third world. I value success and the rewards it brings, but what's successful for me is absolute poverty for many who could never dream of a life under a billion dollars net worth. Yet people in other countries less well off would view me in a similar light and remark at the disparity between my living situation and theirs, which is modest by Western standards.

It's a pipe dream that we could ever see our planet as one people, but unless we do, we will never have the collective strength and cohesion to solve anything on a global level.

I personally feel its more about weakening public support for intervention.  

The facts on the ground are.

1.) China's main goal in the short term is Taiwan

2.) If the west (mainly) intervenes in a Chinese Invasion of Taiwan, it will 100% fail. China has nowhere near the Naval capabilities to challenge the US Navy. Your land army means nothing if they cant cross the sea. As a result an increase or massive reinvestment into westerm arms manufacturing is pretty irrelevant since the west already has enough power to prevent China from taking Taiwan. 

So the only way for China to take Taiwan is for the US to basically not get involved. The question then becomes how to get that to happen? The answer is popular opinion like what prevented the US from entering WW2 until they were attacked directly. The US popular opinion will ofc never support China, but it be enough to promote a America First/Isolationist policy. Its not unthinkable as some on the left and the right have been complaining about the US spending on Military aid all while social programs and whatnot are underfunded and infrastructure deteriorates. Everytime a new multi-million dollar US aid package gets sent, some pundits on the left and the right will ask why dont we spend this money on Healthcare, Infra, Education, Debt or etc. Why send money abroad when so many at home are suffering. Sure it might be a drop in the bucket, but the message is still strong among those who are not financially in a good place. So to weaken potential future US resolve, get them to spend more and more on military to the point where the average voter gets sick of it. To that end, the war in Ukraine needs to be prolonged by China so that the US further increases military spending. Such that by the time it is all over, the US Public is sick of Foreign Military spending and intervention and a more isolationist mindset takes root in the populace and as a result the government.  A longshot sure, but its a lot more realistic than somehow beating the US Navy + other Western Allies' Navy. It might also take a long time, but they have time to wait. After all while Taiwan is the sole large exporter of Semiconductor Chips, Western Intervention is guaranteed. However this wont be the case forever as other countries including the US (perhaps noticing how vulnerable such a vital resource is) is also building its own Semi-conductor Chip Industry. So China will have to wait until the day that the US isnt so reliant on Taiwan's chips and are more self reliant.",1677384575.0,1677383964.0,t3_11bbmm3,t1_ja1fwx6,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

\-Putin has delivered a major blow to the Russian economy through not only the sanctions (with more and more new ones being added all the time) but also tanking the Russian/Euro energy industry.  

\-Putin has not only reinvigorated NATO, but caused them to EXPAND, adding thousands of miles of hostile borders in Finland

\-He's caused other NATO countries to increase their own military spending.  And not just NATO.  Important allies like Japan are also increasing their defense budgets (Much to China's dismay, I'm sure)

\-He's lost roughly 200k Russians in ONE YEAR.  And countless pieces of equipment and assets.  And that's not even counting the hundreds of thousands who have fled Russia.

\-He's also exposed his country and military for what they truly are, weakening Russia's stature world wide

Granted, the Pentagon has the expertise on the platform. I get and agree with the argument that the saturation of air defense creates a very likely scenario that we'll see F-16s being shot out of the sky. Ukraine's pilots are willing to risk that, the US is not. 

What I'm not alright with is there's no acknowledgement of a readiness for if/when the Pentagon tells Biden 'oh shit, they need jets.' The Pentagon isn't a single voice, we've had leaks of frustrated staffers arguing that Sullivan is responsible for stalling proposals. 

If/when that 'oh shit' moment comes, we're a year or two away from seeing them in Ukraine. Steps should be in place now to train pilots and crews for readiness. 

I'm not convinced of the 'they're probably already doing that' hopeful arguments. Contingency and readiness is our thing, and we shouldn't place ourselves in a situation where 60 years from now history books are lamenting about just how wrong an advisor like Sullivan was.

As for conspiracies, it's an easy convenient answer to why things happen in a chaotic world. That's especially true for people who feel powerless. It *must* be powerful shady organisations controlling things. Those dark and sinister bad guys are out to get the good guys like them. But these few special people *know* their dark and sinister secrets.

When asked if he was comfortable with contributing towards the current climate in America as many viewers actually believed his false content to be true, he said he believed he was providing a service to people, he was giving them what they wanted to hear.

I think putin might try to push Russia into the China scenario just as revenge to the west. Like “if I (and my gang) can’t have it, then you can’t have it too”.
