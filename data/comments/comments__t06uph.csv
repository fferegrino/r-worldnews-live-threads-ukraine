Russian troops crossed into Ukraine from the direction of Crimea and are attacking slowly in two directions - towards Melitopol (Zaporizhia region) and Kherson. Our forces are ready to resist and defend our land - presidential aide Arestovych.

Ukrainian forces are repelling the attacks from the direction of Belarus, Rus forces entered 10-20 km into Ukraine's territory in Chernihiv region. Heavy battles raging 4-5 km from Kharkiv city in the East. Arestovych says Ukrainian conscripts destroyed four Russian tanks there

He says Ukrainian border guards, who were attacked first, are demonstrating incredible courage. He says the spirit of Ukrainian forces is very high and Russian reports of them deserting are lies. Dozens of Ukrainian soldiers are killed, but it's less than could have been

Some of NATO's eastern countries have trigged Article 4. Here's what that means
From CNN's Brad Lendon
NATO member states Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have triggered NATO Article 4 to launch consultations within the alliance over Russia's attack on Ukraine.

“The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened,” Article 4 of The North Atlantic Treaty says.

According to the NATO website, consultation under Article 4 can lead to collective action among the 30 member states.
The website says Article 4 has been invoked six times previously since the alliance formed in 1949, most recently by Turkey in February 2020 after dozens of Turkish soldiers were killed by an attack by Syrian government forces in opposition-held areas of northern Syria.

Turkey has invoked Article 4 on four other occasions: once in 2015 to inform the alliance of its response to terrorist attacks in the country; twice in 2012 after a Turkish warplane was shot down in northern Syria and after Turkish civilians were killed by Syrian shelling; and in 2003 when it asked for alliance help to protect its population from any spillover from the war in neighboring Iraq.

On two of those occasions, NATO responded with military aid, sending Patriot missile batteries to protect against Syrian attacks in 2012 and sending aircraft and missile batteries to southeastern Turkey along the border with Iraq in 2003.

Poland invoked Article 4 in 2014 after previous Russian aggression in Ukraine, a meeting that resulted in further alliance efforts to stand together against any threats.

Article 4 is separate from Article 5, which is the alliance’s declaration that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all.",False,1645697400.0,t3_t06uph,t3_t06uph,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

1) When firing, aim for centre of mass. No head shots, you're an untrained civilian and you're more likely to hit your target aiming at their chest. Shoot on an empty breath, don't snatch the trigger, squeeze it for a more accurate shot. No full auto, controlled rounds.

2) Keep moving your firing position if in a fight, staying in one spot will get you killed.

3) No shiny objects on show. No watches, necklaces, rings etc. Light will reflect and give away your position. 

4) Eat and drink as much as you can wherever possible as you don't know where your next meal will be from. Obviously don't drink sewage water.

5) Unless you're going to fight with the army, get out of the cities. If you have a tent and sleeping bags, take them. If you don't, you can build simple shelters from sticks and leaves. Drinking water from the running part of a river, not from a standing still lake. You can survive eating bugs if needed, but it's unpleasant. Hunt if you know how.

6) If you can get russian kit, the better. I wouldn't wear their camo as you'll be mistaken for the enemy, that being said taking their weapons system and ammunition is fair game.

7) If fighting one on one without a gun, everything is fair game. Rip out their eyes if you have to.

If initial reports are true r.e. shot down aircraft and destroyed tanks, it seems the Ukrainian military may have the capability to at the least defend against a blitzkrieg. If the Ukranian govt and army do not capitulate in the first days, the VKS will have to more aggressively bomb inflicting heavier civ casualties, which will enrage the international community more. With harder embargo sanctions promised by the EU (and hopefully more from the U.S. r.e. technoligical services), Russia's economy faces an equity crisis in the short term while any conflict to install a puppet regime in Kyiv elongates. The Russian stock market crashing 40% on the first night as a reactive measure signals that some of the institutional money in Russia are trying to protect equity if they havent already moved out of the market before entirely. This will create a serious cash flow problem which could trigger civil unrest if supply lines for critical infrastructure are threatened in an event of elongated war. This leaves Russia vulnerable economically to its own people and in addition to China who will bankroll the conflict with oil and gas reserves, likely be getting a bargain price for. I suspect this does not end well for Putin's Russia and is perhaps ultimately a huge turning point for cementing its future decline. The refugee crisis will further integrate Ukranian peopke into mainland Europe, facilitating cross cultural relationships and economic partnerships (e.g. Turkey/Germany/Poland). The real winners of the 21st century will continue to be those nations who can achieve economic diversification, innovation, and growth--while promoting multicultural and democratic statehood--as it has been since the industrial revolution.",1645699012.0,1645697685.0,t3_t06uph,t3_t06uph,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

My father grew up in a world where children were taught to hide under their desks because the threat of atomic annihilation was omni present.  It left him, and many of his generation, with phycological scars that truly never healed.

I grew up as a young man in a world that watched not once, but twice, as war became prime time entertainment.  Society became shattered by this theatre of devastation, some could not watch knowing what was the human toll.  Some became numb and retreated into a state of perpetual disassociation.  And sadly others began to cheer for the bombs no longer caring about cause or consequence they ravenously thirsted for more destruction, more death, the voyueristic thrill wholly consuming their very souls.

Now, tonight I saw first hand as the next generation became indoctrinated into the horror of our perpetual blood lust.  The only difference this time is that it now comes as fractured bits and bites presented across a near endless range of multimedia platforms. Each echo chamber expertly tuned so as to ensure everyone only hears what they want to hear.  Each one sponsored ten minutes at a time by a corporate overlord.

At what point do we ask, is it even possible to make any kind of meaningful distinction between human existence and war?

A lot of the soldiers that are there (Russian soldiers that have been built up last few months) do not want to participate in any war. They are there as contractors for money only. As part of their contract they can resign because their contract stipulates that they are signing up to protect their country (and Ukraine and LNR and DNR is not their country). Not sure what kind of social repercussions that would have (being labeled a traitor, or a pussy etc... or being in some database so noone hires you when they run background check on you, but they can breach contract and just miss out on the payment). So the info is from a few days ago. But basically the conversation went something like this between soldiers stationed there and their families.

Wife tells husband to quit and come home (when LNR/DNR movement was announced, so its an out since they would be leaving Russia). But they said that if they quit they'll lose out of money. But if a war actually starts they'll try to quit somehow as to not risk their life. Basically they didnt know if something will or will not happen (meaning they are some soldier not someone important). If its not clear, basically they are interested in money and not risking their life. They'll stay if its safe, leave if its not.

No idea where it went, if they are fighting in Ukraine now or if they quit. But I thought id share that it seems like there isnt a lot of morale to be risking your life in Ukraine among Russian soldiers. Which means once they start having casualties morale will probably drop fast.

It's shit like this that can set dominos in motion. Sure it may not cascade into something truely global, but those global events always have to start somewhere. It's playing with fire.

I'm extremely worried about Putins mental state. He seems very unhinged and no longer has a large circle of advisors. His circle has shrunk into essentially a few puppets for TV rituals. Putin has absolute power - a king listening to the deranged thoughts in his own head. The absurd false history he was spewing in his speech was disturbing. It's never good when a nuclear power that could destroy the world has a man like this at the helm.

I still can't believe half of America *were* happy with a president who openly praises the guy. That alone should have been enough to ruin his political career.

Ukraine's neighbors, Lithuania and Moldova, announce states of emergency

Lithuania and Moldova — two countries bordering Ukraine — are introducing a state of emergency, their presidents said Thursday.

“Today I will sign a decree on introducing the state of emergency, which will passed by the Parliament in an extraordinary session,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said in an address on Thursday morning.

He called Russia’s actions “unprovoked military aggression” which threaten “millions of innocent lives and undermines the foundations of international order.”

The president has reiterated that “Lithuania is safe” as a part of NATO and said the Baltic state would consider further sanctions on Belarus over its involvement.

Moldova, which is not a part of NATO, is ready to accept the thousands of people feeling from Ukraine, said President Maia Sandu.“We will help people who need our help and support,” she said on Thursday.",False,1645697624.0,t3_t06uph,t3_t06uph,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

I know nothing but to me - this is someone who plans 25 steps ahead and considers every possible outcome. Many are saying they heard his mention of repercussion never before seen in history for anybody who tries to intefere and felt chills down their spine. 

Putin controls his reactions and words incredibly carefully from his little smirks to his playful (and somefimes unfortunately true) highlighting of how the USA commits far worse than Russia. 

The idea that he would throw out nukes and choose to simply destroy his country vs what? Take the temporary loss, control the narrative so as toopotmize the optics, and just try again at another point. 

Cleary we’ve seen Russia has been working a long game - his plans are not now or never IMO.  

He wants to build the powerhouse of old and nothing will immortalize him more than overtaking the USA in terms of power and influence and as long as he has the oligarchs wirh him, he’ll have many opportunities to get there especially if the real issue keeps hurting the west which is the tribalistic heartbeat that keeps everyone divided.

Ukrainian President Zelensky's speech before the attack:

""I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.

That is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.

You are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.

You are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.

You are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?

Donetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.

Artema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.

Donbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.

Shcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost

Lugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.

Note that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?

Many of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.

But, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.

War is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.

Who is going to suffer from this the most? The people.

Who does not want this more than anyone? The people.

Who can prevent all this from happening? The people.

If these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.

I know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.

Do the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation.""

More than 80 percent of Russia’s daily foreign exchange transactions and half its trade are conducted in US dollars.

Washington sanctioned two of Russia’s state-owned banks – VEB and Promsvyazbank – and blocked it from trading in its debt on US and European markets. The two Russian banks are considered especially close to the Kremlin and Russia’s military, with more than $80bn in assets.

That includes freezing all of those banks’ assets under US jurisdictions.

Starting on Wednesday, the sanctions include the country’s “elites” and their family members, as well as civilian leaders in Russia’s leadership hierarchy. 

UK:

On Tuesday, the UK announced sanctions against five Russian banks and three Russian billionaires: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg and Igor Rotenberg.

The Rotenbergs are co-owners of SGM Group, which makes oil and gas infrastructure. Timchenko is the owner of private investment firm Volga Group.

The banks are Rossiya Bank, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank and Black Sea Bank.

Britain will also stop Russia from selling sovereign debt in London.

It‘s not like there aren‘t risk involved with nuclear energies. Same with GMOs btw. I mean, some believe Corona was raised in a lab. Accidents happen and their effect can be deadly.

Nowadays Germany is very much all about green energy. The decision to built NS2 was made by a conservative government (CDU/CSU, Merkel‘s party, is traditionally considered a conservative party) but public opinion has changed since then and Germany is majorly concerned with climate change. It was one of the most frequent debates we had in our last election. Every party had to take a stance. Before the Ukraine crisis I think climate change was almost considered the biggest threat to Germany and possibly the entire world.

I know this all might sound left-winged to US citizens but it really isn‘t.

This is not referring to any president at all - past or current, but it's still a valid question. Some people would say yes, some no. If that sentence makes sense, then so does my one above.

I could do a survey and find out that ""Half the country are happy with a president who's mexican"". It simply means they're happy with the idea of it.

Half the country are happy with a president who praises Putin. Trumps presidency proved this.

>So you just want war?

Are you from the past? The war has already started, we already failed to prevent war. Mostly because of our weakness.

> You want US troops dead today in Ukraine.

Yes. I want NATO airforce establishing air superiority in Ukraine and strikes against any Russian formation inside Ukraine, sadly that will mean some airforce servicemen die hopefully to spare tens of countless civilians the same fate as Russia continues to invade one sovereign nation after another.
