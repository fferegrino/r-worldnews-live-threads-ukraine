Others have abandoned their vehicles and have set off back towards the Russian border on foot, lugging their weapons and kitbags, videos suggest. These episodes do not mean that the Kremlin will fail in its attempts to conquer Ukraine, as its tactics shift to brutal shelling of civilians.

I'm former SERE Specialist with the United States Air Force and now currently do the same mission as a federal civilian, and with the influx of volunteers and the overlapping of forces, I wanted to give some advice here on thread 100.

My specialty and wheel house while in and now has to do with your rights and actions under the Geneva Conventions both as an evader and prisoner of war.

 Nothing you are about to hear is classified and evasion information can be found here open source from the Air Force
 https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a3/publication/afh10-644/afh10-644.pdf

**Evasion Considerations**

1. You are a lawful combatant even when evading. If you are going to use lethal force to escape consider the consequences of a follow up capture. Be smart. 

2. 1000 days of evading is better than 1 day of captivity.

3. Coverage from overhead surveillance is priority 1. If making a hole up site find overhead first, then build up ground level camo

**Captivity**

4. If captured, you are no longer a combatant. YOU MAY NOT USE LETHAL FORCE ANYMORE UNTIL YOU ARE REINSTATED BY YOUR MILITARY. THIS INCLUDES ESCAPE ATTEMPTS. You can be held accountable for actual murder if they recapture you. If lethal force guarantees freedom, that's on you to not get caught again
 
5. You are afforded the same living conditions as your captors. If they get beds, you don't get dirt. Be polite but persistent in your needs. They should feed, water, and give you proper sanitation. Anything else is violation of GCs

6. When captured you're allowed a capture card within 7 days of arriving in your facility. This is a post free card that is sent to Switzerland to then send out to your home Nation to show you're captured. Every time you're moved to a new permanent facility you're afforded a new card. 

7. You're allowed letters. Don't let them use letters as a bargaining chip for information. They can't withhold them. They're allowed to censor them. 

8. I am rewording this because it wasn't clear before. If you are a woman captive, you are safer living with your male allies and countrymen in a group environment than you are isolated on your own. This means that if they attempt segregated quarters, you should be asking to all stay together. This prevents attacks of opportunity and sexual exploitation by guards of women who have been separated and have no one to help fight them off or be witness to it. 

9. You're not to do any labor that furthers their war effort (moving weapons, loading weapons, etc). You can refuse.

10. You can refuse exploitation and questioning. They're not supposed to do this. It's going to happen anyway. Make it counter productive. 

11. Insulate captives, don't isolate. If someone is struggling or answering questions encourage and support them to get back to mental strength. 

12. Always ask to do things in pairs or groups. Group resilience is stronger than individual and prevents opportunity attacks from unconstrained captors. 

13. If you do escape, you're allowed to do what you need to do survive. If you steal, you steal, but know you can be tried if captured. 

If anyone has any questions I'm here to answer. Stay strong out there.",1646374103.0,1646368353.0,t3_t6a6w7,t3_t6a6w7,,0,129,0,129,1,0,

Putin lost any appearance of a military that's prepared to fight the west in a modern land conflict.

Last year, my partner & I traveled to Kharkiv  to buy a pomeranian puppy from a breeder that I found online - absolute gem of a girl who invited us into her home, met her children, adorable dogs, and she showed us around the city, and drove us to/from airport. We’ve kept in contact for the last year, and especially this last week. We’ve been so, sooo worried about her. She’s been giving us updates directly and she also posts through her instagram stories. When most civilians went underground for shelter, she decided to stick it out at home, as she has about 25-30 pomeranians and one of them just gave birth to a litter around the time that the invasion started. She obviously cannot bring all of those dogs and she didn’t want to leave them, so she bunkered down in her home.  She posted a story yesterday asking if any of her friends were still in the area, and if they intended to cross the border, would they be willing to take a few of her dogs with them. Gave me the impression that she’s trying to get out (understandably so - the scenes from kharkiv are devastating)

anyway, i’m rambling, sorry - she’s constantly active on IG and my partner and i are always checking to see when she was last active, just for some reassurance that she’s alive and ok (i hate to put it that way, but you know what i mean =l ) she hasn’t been online at all since around 1 PM EST, so that would be 8 PM in kharkiv. she’s a night owl and we found  it unusual that she wasn’t active at all, but we figured eh, maybe she got some rest finally. with it being 8 AM there now and still no signs of her being active online, I can’t help but to fear the worst. I know that sounds so silly and 21st century “oMg tHeYrE NoT OnLiNe tHeYrE dEd!!1!!11!” but just given the circumstances and how frequent her updates were, and then nothing, im a bit worried. so, I was wondering if there were any updates or word about the state of Kharkiv’s communications, power, etc.  if anyone’s a bit more in the know or up to date with this stuff than me, please do let me know - thank you",1646373783.0,1646373689.0,t3_t6a6w7,t3_t6a6w7,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

But it’s also sad because we shouldn’t even have 1 of these threads. The fact that we reached 100 and there doesnt seem to be a quick end in sight is disturbing and alarming.

I’m so worried people will hate us Russian people and we’re now viewed as disgusting murderers. 

I’m so sad there isn’t the words. I migrated to london just before the pandemic, for me the final straw so to speak was when Putin decriminalised domestic violence. I could see clearer than ever the downward spiral russia was being taken and I wanted no part in it. 
I didn’t want to raise my babies in such a country. My babies deserve human rights, freedom and happiness. 

**I’m devastated beyond words, I have family in Ukraine and friends I love to the moon and back, as many of us Russians do. It’s hypocritical for a Russian to say they ‘hate’ Ukrainians, because we’re once one - so many of our ancestors are from Ukraine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I feel like a coward. Here in the UK while my Ukrainian friends are dying, fleeing for their lives or being drafted.

HE IS DESTROYING MY HOMELAND. HE IS A PSYCHOPATH. The last ruble collapse in the 90s, children we’re prostituting themselves!!!!! People were starving and dying in ditches!!!! Innocent people! 

And it annoys me greatly when westerners say ‘JUST RISE UP!!’ 

Your privilege is astounding!!! We are beaten, killed, arrested and we disappear if we speak up against the government! People who tried are now rotting in prison or are gone. There have been numerous anti corruption protests for years!!! 

HE IS KILLING IS OWN AND UKRAINIANS

I beg the west to STOP the sanctions!!!! For the lives of innocent Russian people, this will do no good, Putin is laughing, he doesn’t care!

I can explain. 

The current line is that Ukraine's government is illegitimate, having been put into power by a US coup instigated by (wait for it) HILLARY CLINTON who is using (it gets better!) HUNTER BIDEN to launder all the money she makes from her (cherry on top here) GLOBAL CHILD SEX SLAVE TRAFFICKING OPERATION. Also, Obama. 

Obviously Putin, being a God-fearing man, only wants to stop this. This is why Biden and the Democrats oppose him: if they lost their child sex fortune they could no longer afford to steal elections! 

If we can just reelect Trump the US can switch sides, join the Good Guys, and finally smash Hillary Clinton's global sex empire.

When the Russian stock market reopens, there is a strong rationale that the government is going to seize multiple sectors of their economy and nationalize it. Once nationalized they can artificially keep the value of government stocks high and attempt to slow deflation by controlling these prices.

It didn’t work for Venezuela, and it won’t work for Russia. 

But all Russia needs is a coupon weeks of stopgap deflation while the “Ministry of Enlightenment” issues propaganda to the country about how the world is attacking them.

We went to war with Iraq because they supposedly had WMD that they were about to give to terrorists.

 >""Putin – khuylo""! (Ukrainian: Пу́тін — хуйло́, IPA: [ˈput⁽ʲ⁾in xʊjˈlɔ]; Russian: Пу́тин — хуйло́, IPA: [ˈputʲɪn xʊjˈlo]; commonly translated as ""Putin is a dickhead"") is a Ukrainian and Russian slogan deriding Russian President Vladimir Putin. It originated in Ukraine in 2014 having grown from a football chant first performed by FC Metalist Kharkiv ultras and Shaktar Donetsk ultras in March 2014 on the onset of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The phrase has become very widespread throughout Ukraine among supporters of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and, more generally, those who opposed Vladimir Putin in both Russia and Ukraine.

>""It's definitely true, in the sense that Putin is a person who believes he's been given a special mission, that he's a statesman,"" says Narusova, 63, speaking at the Museum of Democratic Development she founded in her late husband’s name.

Definition:

Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete. They regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.\[8\] A fascist state is led by a strong leader (such as a dictator) and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.\[8\] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.\[9\]

Failing that establishing a land bridge to the west will at least enable him to better supply Crimea in the coming decades.

However, if he is genuinely concerned with Nato he may consider taking the whole thing - how he'll hold the whole country is anyone's guess.

Also deliberate, I believe, is your misconstruction in indicating Putin's 'satisfaction' to be the ""devastating"" outcome for everyone.  Did you mean to say ""if not""?  Why didn't you then?  In a hurry?

I perceive a semantic sleight-of-hand, designed to interrupt a coherent grasp of the concepts expressed in the sentence.  ESL typists often do something similar, but this instance seems a little too carefully aimed to be accidental.

The classic ""react with extreme steps"" is exactly the trope Putin has used to gamble his way into strategically advantageous positions; by threatening annihilation and sowing panic & disunity, from which he then takes swift and preemptive actions to catch his opponents off guard.

You are either firmly in the grip of Putin's psychological shackles by fixating on his capacity to disrupt and destroy... Or you are only pretending to be, so as to inspire others to fear Putin just like you're being paid to do.

The Kremlin released a statement yesterday promising that if this conflict escalates into a world war, they will be fighting with nukes. Ik all week ( and for a long time in general ) they've vaguely threatened various nations with nuclear strikes, although they never really come straight out and say "" we will use our nukes "" like they did yesterday. That's a pretty substantial threat and one that shouldn't be taken lightly given the situation Putin & Russia are in rn. 

They thing is, most people who would come up in power and have nefarious intentions on their rule would want to actually rule for as long as possible. Putin has been in control for 20+ years already, he is approaching 70 years old, has obv health issues, he has nothing to really lose anymore. He uses Russia as his scapegoat to just do the things he wants and to hold the power he currently has. He'd flip his nation in an instant if it was in his best interest. He doesn't care.

So it's completely understandable why these nations with years of ingrained intelligence would not wanna escalate him far enough to start a nuclear war.

Any reactor can maximally damage a region if everything goes wrong; we haven't ever seen a worst-case scenario and that includes Chernobyl.  ""ten times"", ""twenty times"" - that's all bullshit.

And, there are other measures, e.g.: People getting foreign money, e.g. Euros or USD, are required within 3 days to convert these to Rubles.  The value of the Ruble is plummetting.

But, as was rightly pointed out, the victims of abuse don't magically learn compassion, they learn ways to channel their hatred they way their abusers did. There is no lesson of love bundled up in the Nazi agenda, so why do we expect the Jews to have magically found one, for example?

The compassion in these stories always comes from third part observers. The neighbour that helps a starving child, the Allies that liberate a death camp, the whites who protested Apartheid alongside blacks - but those cases aren't a given, and while we hear of examples of people who emerge from abuse with these experiences that make them stronger, the vast majority of victims done have some random positive epiphany. They emerge from abuse, with only horror and the memories of that horror.

So the lesson is that it's us third party observers who can look cooly at a situation that have the responsibility to learn the lessons and act with a level head. Just as you might try to help guide a friend going down a dark path because of childhood abuses, we as a society have a responsibility to nurture and steer people's that's have historically been victims down a more positive path.

No one is thinking for themselves. They'll follow a Chomsky (who is not wrong, but completely ignored the Russian threat) blindly. Actually, so many of their arguments are condensed down to meme or Tik Tok form that I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't know who the hell Chomsky is.

Edit: I wanted to note that Russian cyber operations are such that they purposely hit the West at it's weakest points by targeting our political discourse. In the US, they supported both the far left and far right. Mainly through ""troll farms"" that run various Facebook pages and Twitter feeds. This strategy is following this line from Dugin's 'Foundations of Geopolitics'  


""Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics""

The idea originally was that countries that have McDonalds have an infrastructure / legal / money system stable enough to have a middle class, and if the middle class can't go to McDonalds, they certainly don't want a war.

So this kind of begs the question, will Russia essentially beg out the war when they can't afford to eat at McDonalds?

> Ukraine is one of a few English country names traditionally used with the definite article the. This is apparently because the word ""ukraina"" means ""borderland"", and so would be translated as if ""the borderlands"" — the Ukraine — like how Nederlanden, meaning ""nether lands"", is translated as ""the Netherlands"". Use of the article was standard before Ukrainian independence, but has decreased since the 1990s. For example, the Associated Press dropped the article ""the"" on 3 December 1991. Use of the definite article was criticised as suggesting a non-sovereign territory, much like ""the Lebanon"" referred to the region before its independence, or as one might refer to ""the Midwest"", a region of the United States.

> In 1993, the Ukrainian government explicitly requested that, in linguistic agreement with countries and not regions, the Russian preposition в be used instead of на, and in 2012, the Ukrainian embassy in London further stated that it is politically and grammatically incorrect to use a definite article with Ukraine. Use of Ukraine without the definite article has since become commonplace in journalism and diplomacy (examples are the style guides of The Guardian and The Times).",1646373076.0,1646372935.0,t3_t6a6w7,t1_hza85xb,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

Украина (Ukraina) in old slavic simply means ""borderland"" or ""outskirts."" This word passes into modern Russian as ""окраина"" (Okraina). As much of the land was often controlled by Austria (western Europe's strongest nation for much post-Roman history) and Russia (eastern Europe's strongest nation for much of the same time), it was seen as ""the borderlands"" between the East and Western Europe. Hence, educated English speakers referred to it as ""the Ukraine"" just as they would ""the borderlands."" Though, yes, now it is preferred to say ""Ukraine"" so as to stress it being it's own sovereign state.

Btw, it's not the only country that has a name like that. I'm sure you've heard of the ""The Netherlands.""

I think those reasons within themselves are a form of cultural imperialism, and definitely a form of American haughtiness. But that’s not the same as “wanting to kill muslims indiscriminately”. Objectively, the world is a better place without Hussein.

“American support for Ba'athist Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War, in which it fought against post-revolutionary Iran, included several billion dollars' worth of economic aid, the sale of dual-use technology, non-U.S. origin weaponry, military intelligence, and special operations training.[257][258] The U.S. refused to sell arms to Iraq directly due to Iraq's ties to terrorist groups, but several sales of ""dual-use"" technology have been documented; notably, Iraq purchased 45 Bell helicopters for $200 million in 1985. Total sales of U.S. dual-use technology to Iraq are estimated at $500 million.[259][260]

U.S. government support for Iraq was not a secret and was frequently discussed in open sessions of the Senate and House of Representatives.[261] **American views toward Iraq were not enthusiastically supportive in its conflict with Iran, and activity in assistance was largely to prevent an Iranian victory.

 >The ""Napoleon complex"", known informally as small man syndrome, is a theorized inferiority complex normally attributed to people of short stature. It is characterized by overly-aggressive or domineering social behavior, such as lying about earnings, and carries the implication that such behavior is compensatory for the subject's physical or social shortcomings. In psychology, the Napoleon complex is regarded as a derogatory social stereotype.

0859a7a7306e6d2d78f8214029b526f7,t6a6w7,hza25n8,"Some representatives of the Russian political class today argue that Russia is able to inflict a crushing defeat on Ukraine in a few hours (and shorter periods are also mentioned) if a military conflict breaks out. Let's see how such statements correspond to reality.  
  
In the expert community of Russia, the opinion has recently taken root quite strongly that it will not even be necessary to send troops to the territory of Ukraine, since the Armed Forces of this country are in a deplorable state.  
  
Some political analysts emphasize that a powerful Russian fire strike will destroy almost all surveillance and communication systems, artillery and tank formations. Moreover, a number of experts conclude that even one crushing blow from Russia will be enough to end such a war.  
  
As a cherry on the cake, some analysts emphasize the fact that no one in Ukraine will defend the “Kyiv regime”.  
  
NO EASY WALK  
  
Let's start with the last one. To assert that no one in Ukraine will defend the regime means, in practice, complete ignorance of the military-political situation and the mood of the broad masses of the people in the neighboring state. Moreover, the degree of hatred (which, as you know, is the most effective fuel for armed struggle) in the neighboring republic in relation to Moscow is frankly underestimated. No one will meet the Russian army with bread, salt and flowers in Ukraine.  
  
It seems that the events in the south-east of Ukraine in 2014 did not teach anyone anything. Then, after all, they also expected that the entire left-bank Ukraine, in a single impulse and in a matter of seconds, would turn into Novorossia. We have already drawn maps, estimated the personnel of future administrations of cities and regions, and developed state flags.  
  
But even the Russian-speaking population of this part of Ukraine (including such cities as Kharkov, Zaporozhye, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariupol) did not support such plans in their vast majority. The project ""Novorossiya"" was somehow imperceptibly blown away and quietly died.  
  
In a word, the liberation campaign in 2022, following the model and likeness of 1939, will not succeed in any way. In this case, the words of the classic of Soviet literature Arkady Gaidar are more true than ever: “It is clear that we will now have not an easy battle, but a hard battle.”  
  
""BY A SMALL BLOOD, A POWERFUL BLOW""  
  
Now about the ""powerful fire strike by Russia"", which allegedly will destroy ""practically all surveillance and communication systems, artillery and tank formations of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.""  
  
This expression alone shows that only political workers could say such a thing. For reference: in the course of hypothetical military operations on the scale of a theater of operations, strikes are carried out on priority targets and massive fire strikes. Note that in the course of operational-strategic planning, the epithets “powerful” (as well as “medium”, “weak”, etc.) are not used.  
  
Military science emphasizes that strikes can be strategic (this mostly applies to strategic nuclear forces), operational and tactical. According to the number of forces involved and objects hit, strikes can be massive, group and single. It is still better not to introduce or use other concepts, even in works of a political science nature.  
  
Attacks on priority targets and massive fire strikes can be carried out within the framework of the front (fronts on the western borders of Russia have not yet been formed) or the main command of the armed forces in the theater of operations (so far, one has not been created in the South-Western strategic direction either). Anything less than that is no longer a massive hit.  
  
And what is, for example, a massive fire strike (MOA) of the front? To begin with, we note that the maximum number of combat-ready forces and means of aviation, missile troops and artillery, electronic warfare equipment at the disposal of the commander of the front forces (operational-strategic formation) is involved in the MOU. The MOU consists of one massive air sortie, two or three launches of OTP and TR missile systems, and several artillery fire raids. Well, if the degree of fire damage to the enemy is 60-70%.  
  
What is the most important thing in this matter in relation to the conflict with Ukraine? Of course, the MOU will inflict heavy losses on a potential enemy. But to expect to crush the armed forces of an entire state with just one such blow means to show simply unbridled optimism in the course of planning and conducting combat operations. In the course of hypothetical strategic actions on the theater of operations, such MOUs will have to be applied not one or two, but much more.  
  
It must be added by all means that the reserves of promising and high-precision weapons in the RF Armed Forces are not of any unlimited nature. Hypersonic missiles of the Zircon type are not yet in service. And the number of Kalibr (sea-launched cruise missiles), Kinzhals, Kh-101 (air-launched cruise missiles) and Iskander missiles is measured in the hundreds at best (tens in the case of Kinzhals). This arsenal is absolutely not enough to wipe out a state the size of France and with a population of more than 40 million from the face of the Earth.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

 >Acoustic Kitty is a CIA project launched by the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology, which in the 1960s intended to use cats to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies. In an hour-long procedure a veterinary surgeon implanted a microphone in the cat's ear canal, a small radio transmitter at the base of its skull and a thin wire into its fur.

FAQ

**What does this mean?**

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

**Why did you do this?**

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

	•	Rudeness towards other Redditors,
	•	Spreading incorrect information,
	•	Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a  /s .

**Am I banned from the Reddit?**

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

**I don’t believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?**

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
**
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?**

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",False,1646368225.0,t3_t6a6w7,t1_hz9zs8t,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >A literacy test assesses a person's literacy skills: their ability to read and write have been administered by various governments to immigrants. In the United States, between the 1850s and 1960s, literacy tests were administered to prospective voters, and this had the effect of disenfranchising African Americans and others with diminished access to education. Other countries, notably Australia, as part of its White Australia policy, and South Africa adopted literacy tests either to exclude certain racialized groups from voting or from immigrating.
 
**[Eugenics in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States)** 
 
 >Eugenics, the set of beliefs and practices which aims at improving the genetic quality of the human population, played a significant role in the history and culture of the United States from the late 19th century into the mid-20th century. The cause became increasingly promoted by intellectuals of the Progressive Era. While ostensibly about improving genetic quality, it has been argued that eugenics was more about preserving the position of the dominant groups in the population.

I'm no expert, but I think most decent modern tanks have maximum operational ranges in the 300-500 km range... but you normally move them long distances by train or truck. 

That said, the issue is probably due to poor planning, disorganization, terrible logistics, and unexpected resistance, rather than anything to do with the range limitations of Russian tanks. They might *not* have had full tanks of fuel to begin with (Russia is corrupt as fuck, after all) but either way, they probably burnt what they did have while idling in epic traffic jams, and then struggled to get resupplied, which only compounded problems.

0859a7a7306e6d2d78f8214029b526f7,t6a6w7,hza26mx,"ABOUT AIR SUPERIORITY  
  
Sometimes it is asserted in the Russian expert community (by fans of the Douai doctrine) that since the hypothetical military operations in Ukraine will take place under the conditions of complete dominance of Russian aircraft in the air, the war will be extremely short and will end in the shortest possible time.  
  
At the same time, it is somehow forgotten that the armed formations of the Afghan opposition during the conflict of 1979-1989 did not have a single aircraft and not a single combat helicopter. And the war in this country dragged on for as much as 10 years. The Chechen fighters did not have a single aircraft either. And the fight against them lasted for several years and cost the federal forces a lot of blood and casualties.  
  
And the Armed Forces of Ukraine still have some kind of combat aircraft. As well as means of air defense.  
  
By the way, the Ukrainian crews of the anti-aircraft missile forces (by no means Georgian ones) significantly pinched the Russian Air Force during the 2008 conflict. After the first day of hostilities, the leadership of the Russian Air Force was in frank shock from the losses incurred. And you shouldn't forget about it.  
  
Mourned in advance  
  
Now about the thesis ""The Armed Forces of Ukraine are in a deplorable state."" Of course, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have problems with aviation and modern air defense systems. But the following must also be acknowledged. If until 2014 the Armed Forces of Ukraine were a fragment of the Soviet army, over the past seven years a qualitatively different army has been created in Ukraine, on a completely different ideological basis and largely on NATO standards. And very modern weapons and equipment are being supplied and continue to be supplied to Ukraine from many countries of the North Atlantic Alliance.  
  
As for the weakest point of the Armed Forces of Ukraine - the Air Force. It cannot be ruled out that the collective West may, in a fairly short time, supply Kiev with fighters, as they say, from the presence of the armed forces - in other words, second-hand. However, this second-hand, in terms of its tactical and technical characteristics, will be quite comparable with the majority of aircraft in the Russian fleet.  
  
Of course, today the Armed Forces of Ukraine are significantly inferior to the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in terms of their combat and operational capabilities. No one doubts this, neither in the East nor in the West.  
  
But this army cannot be taken lightly either. In this regard, one must always remember the testament of Alexander Suvorov: ""Never despise your enemy, do not consider him stupider and weaker than you.""  
  
Now with regard to the assertion that Western countries will not send a single soldier to die for Ukraine.  
  
It should be noted that this is likely to be the case. However, in the event of Russia's invasion, this does not at all rule out massive assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the collective West with a wide variety of weapons and military equipment and bulk deliveries of all kinds of materiel. In this regard, the West has already shown a consolidated position, unprecedented until now, which, it seems, was not predicted in Moscow.  
  
There is no doubt that the United States and the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance will begin a kind of reincarnation of Lend-Lease, modeled after the Second World War, there is no doubt. An influx of volunteers from the West, which can be very numerous, is not ruled out.  
  
PARTISANS AND UNDERGROUND  
And finally, about the duration of a hypothetical campaign. In the Russian expert community, several hours are called, sometimes even several tens of minutes. At the same time, it is somehow forgotten that we have already gone through all this. The phrase ""take the city with one airborne regiment in two hours"" has already become a classic of the genre.  
It is also worth recalling that the mighty Stalinist NKVD and the multi-million Soviet army fought the nationalist underground in Western Ukraine for more than 10 years. And now there is an option that the whole of Ukraine can easily go into the partisans. In addition, these formations can easily begin to operate already on the territory of Russia.  
The armed struggle in large Ukrainian cities is generally difficult to predict. It is common knowledge that the big city is the best battlefield for the weak and less technically advanced side of the armed conflict.  
Serious experts emphasize that in a metropolis it is possible not only to concentrate a grouping of thousands and even tens of thousands of fighters, but also to hide it from the superior firepower of the enemy. And also to supply it with material resources for a long time and make up for losses in people and equipment. Neither mountains, nor forests, nor jungles today provide such an opportunity.  
Experts are convinced that the urban environment helps the defenders, slows down the movement of the attackers, allows you to place a record number of fighters per unit area, and compensates for the lag in forces and technologies. And in Ukraine there are more than enough large cities, including those with a million inhabitants. So the Russian army in the course of a hypothetical war with Ukraine may meet with far more than just Stalingrad and Grozny.  
CONCLUSIONS  
In general, there will be no Ukrainian blitzkrieg. The statements of some experts such as “The Russian army will defeat most of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 30-40 minutes”, “Russia is able to defeat Ukraine in 10 minutes in the event of a full-scale war”, “Russia will defeat Ukraine in eight minutes” have no serious grounds.  
And finally, the most important thing. An armed conflict with Ukraine is currently fundamentally not in Russia's national interests. Therefore, it is best for some overexcited Russian experts to forget about their hatred fantasies.

 >The madman theory is a political theory commonly associated with US President Richard Nixon's foreign policy. Nixon and his administration tried to make the leaders of hostile Communist Bloc nations think he was irrational and volatile. According to the theory, those leaders would then avoid provoking the United States, fearing an unpredictable American response. Some international relations scholars have been skeptical of madman theory as a strategy for success in bargaining.

Also, if Ukraine surrendered, Putin would use any wealth it had remaining to extend Russia's own dwindling supply. So now, we have civilians being killed, their wealth being stolen, russian soldiers occupying Ukraine and doing whatever they want to the populace (because let's be honest, Putin won't stop them from murdering, stealing, and raping).

On the other hand, Ukraine can fight for its sovereignty and, I think, hold Russia off with western aid while the sanctions take effect.

You also are discounting the Ukrainian people. They've made it clear that they don't want to surrender. They want to be Ukrainians, not Russians and not Russian puppets. The US and UK are saying there would be an insurgency, which I believe. In that case, Putin would use the same tactics he's used in Chechnya and Syria.

In my eyes, based upon Putin's own rhetoric, surrender guarantees death, while fighting has a chance of death, but also a chance of victory.

I don't want the war to continue, but I also don't want Putin to have his way with Ukraine in the hopes that when Russia falls, Ukraine can be free again. It seems defeatist and puts millions of lives at the whim of a dictator.

a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions.
True of Putin and Russia pertaining to their actions in the Ukraine and the extent to witch they have deployed information warfare tactics agains their traditional adversaries in the west.

the primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right, whether individual or universal, and the subordination of the individual to it.
Somewhat True of Putin and Russia as demonstrated with their preoccupation with the blood and soil narrative regarding ethnic Russians wherever they may be found. I have not seen much propaganda of the sort we had in NAZI and Soviet Times where the Group, party or state, is considered greater than the individual. You do see some of this in practice but I cant go all in on this.

the belief that one’s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies, both internal and external.
True of Putin and Russia as demonstrated with their preoccupation with the blood and soil narrative regarding ethnic Russians wherever they may be found. Additionally the efforts Putin goes to to deny legitimacy and sovereignty to former soviet satellites.

dread of the group’s decline under the corrosive effects of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences.
True of Putin and Russia when you look at the homophobic policies and statements made and implemented over recent decades. Also true when you consider the elevation of the church to a position it has not had since Tsarist times. Putin himself has declared liberalism obsolete - see Mussolini above.

the need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary.
I do not see this happening in Russia. Russia is essentially a one party state but it is ethnically and culturally diverse. With the exception of homophobic persecution. Possibly true too that feminisim is persecuted although maybe not officially.

the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain who alone is capable of incarnating the group’s historical destiny.
This is strongly true in Russia and the cult-like following Putin has.

the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason.
This is strongly true in Russia and the cult-like following Putin has.

the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group’s success.
I do not see this in Russia, Putinists deploy violence widely but always in a cloak and dagger way. There is no “beauty of our weapons” narrative when Russia deploys force.

the right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law, right being decided by the sole criterion of the group’s prowess within a Darwinian struggle.
I do not see this in Russia, Puitin does not sell a chosen peoiple narrative about Russia or Russians.

From the above I would say that Putin is quite fascist. He does not fulfil all the criteria of the great 20th century Fascists but then neither did some 20th century fascists such as Peron and Franco.

That was in 2015. They've since been pulled from the front lines, and the country has been getting attacked by Russia ever since, so it's not like they can afford to turn away willing combatants. They've been criticized, and rightly so, and the battalion has changed leaders repeatedly.

At this point, nothing that single battalion has done is worse than Russias assaults, genocides, and backing of extremist dictators the world over.

One brigade that has been pulled, versus Putin backing the Syrian government, which used chemical warfare on its citizens. Or how about the invasion of Georgia. Or the vicious attack on Grozny? So many war crimes

But sure, claim the high ground there buddy.

I am pretty sure he has no such designs though.

He is supposed to be enacting martial law in Russia and is using everything he can to try and defeat Ukraine. Those aren't the actions of someone who is trying to create a neutral state.

He attacked Ukraine in 2014 when the Russian backed president was removed by the people. He attacked Ukraine again this year with 0 provocation. He has been making up excuses the entire time. He still refers to this as a ""special military action in the Donbas.""

He is not trying to establish a neutral state. He wants, at best, a puppet state.

I understand the arguments about him being worried about NATO expansion. I'm also pretty sure they are contrived BS. Ukraine wouldn't want to be in NATO if he hadn't shown a willingness, a desire even, to attack them and make them a puppet state.
