And countries usually only take action like expelling them when they get caught committing criminal activity.

Russian claims of denazification:

Yes the Azov battalion exists, congrats. Stop bringing it up, it's not proof of Ukraine being Nazi controlled. It's a small Authoritarian Right Militia group that was absorbed into the formal Ukrainian army. It is not representative of the country as a whole.Maybe before President Putin claims this idealism of ridding Ukraine of Nazi's, he should look to his own country that created this problem in the form of the RNU. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_National\_Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_National_Unity)

This problem that still persists to this day that apparently is not a problem for Russia but somehow is for Ukraine.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_nationalism)

So before you go citing the Azov battalion as an example of Putin's justifications, remember he has yet to solve Nazism in his own country.

&#x200B;

Russian Stock Market:

The stock market is closed today and will be closed tomorrow. They are doing this to prevent the ruble from tanking. This is only a temporary measure and will not actually solve the problem they are facing. Picture it like your car having it's check engine light on and you deciding not to drive it as a way to solve the problem. The problem doesn't go away once you decide to drive it again. The stock market will not miraculously stabilize because Putin kept it closed for a couple days. He staving off the inevitable panic selling that will happen once it reopens.

&#x200B;

Russian Nuclear Escalation:

If you want to be worried about nuclear weapons that's fine. I have my opinions on the likelihood of him launching but lets talk beside that. Lets talk IF Putin launches. There's nothing that can be done. If Russia launches then everyone launches, period. There is no scenario where they use a nuke on Ukraine (even as a false flag from Belarus) that doesn't result in every other nation launching in retaliation. At that point there is quite literally nothing anyone can do.I personally don't think he's dumb enough to launch, or anyone listening to him is dumb enough to obey the order. But IF (and that's a big if) it does happen then it's no one's problem any more. If you manage to survive, good luck. If you don't? So long and thanks for all the fish.

&#x200B;

Russian Military:

There is absolutely no evidence to support the idea that Russia hasn't sent their most capable forces out to fight yet. It would monumentally stupid to do so and drag this conflict out. Doing so results in the sanctions you are seeing today. It was expedient of them to take Ukraine as quickly as possible. The failure of the Russian Military comes down to a few things.

\- The underestimation of the Ukrainian military

\- the resolve of the Ukrainian people and it's leaders

\- The underestimation of the EU's, UN's, and NATO's quick and cohesive response

\- The lack of preparations and understanding of their enemy

\- the poor coordination of their troops and units

\- the poor maintenance of their tanks and planes

\- the poor training and condition of their troops overall

\- the arrogance of Putin- the people under Putin refusing to object to anything he says

&#x200B;

What is Putin's endgame:

He wants to restore the land and economical power of the former USSR without having communism. He wants to be a primary power on the world stage. If you listen to him his words smack of old school, cold war soviet posturing. He's a strong man needing to display strong man tendencies. That means challenging the power of NATO by taking non-NATO countries. It's pretty simple.

&#x200B;

What about Russian peacetalks:

There is no scenario where Putin can have a successful peace talk and walk away any form of winner. Zelensky will not capitulate on anything, NATO will not just let Putin do what he pleases anymore, and Putin can't walk away with nothing without potentially losing his position or worse his head. The peace talks are just there for Putin to shrug his shoulders to the Russia people and say ""Well guys, I tried"". Anything he demands will be absolutely outrageous and unthinkable for Zelensky to accept. Anything Zelensky demands Putin will see as a loss and refuse to agree too. We are getting into Sunk Cost Fallacy territory now with the types of losses the Russian military is experiencing.

>Russian convoy north of Kyiv is now stretched out over at least 17 miles.

>A large convoy of Russian armed forces is moving closer to Kyiv. The group of at least several hundred vehicles was initially detected in satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies on Sunday. On Monday, it was approximately 20 miles north of Antonov Airport on the outskirts of Kyiv, and 30 miles from the city limits. The convoy is stretched out over at least 17 miles, with some gaps in the column of vehicles. The line of vehicles is so extensive that it was not entirely captured in today’s satellite imagery. In some areas, the vehicles are two to three rows deep.

>It is unclear if the convoy is planning to go toward Kyiv’s city center or if it will possibly join forces with other Russian troops to encircle the city.

Here is the translation.

>#The offensive of Russia and the new world

>A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered in a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internal Russian. Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.

>**Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome**. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual **civil war**, because now **brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other,** but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. **Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians.** If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.

>Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by **deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations**. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the **main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. And the issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine and an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them**.

>The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the **Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states**, not one, but two peoples. **That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade - recoding, de-Russification of Russians and inciting Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.**

>Now this problem is gone - **Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state of part of the Russian world.** In what borders, in what form will the alliance with Russia be fixed (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus )? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.

>And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - **it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole**. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe . And he is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

>**Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin , seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kiev ? That the Russians will forever be a divided people?** And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which happened according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. To swipe after that also on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. **The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order not to understand this, one had to be just geopolitical fools**.

>More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.

>Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. **Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. There will be losses from the sublimation of confrontation on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically**. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

>Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. Yes, and it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.

>But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China . If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible.

>Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

>China and India , Latin America and Africa , the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West, it has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646082031.0,t3_t3pr7i,t3_t3pr7i,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Edit:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermobaric_weapon

>A thermobaric weapon, aerosol bomb, or vacuum bomb is a type of explosive that uses oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a high-temperature explosion. In practice, the blast wave typically produced by such a weapon is of a significantly longer duration than that of a conventional condensed explosive. The fuel–air explosive is one of the best-known types of thermobaric weapon.

....

>The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique—and unpleasant. ... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs. ... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as with most chemical agents.",1646087402.0,1646087317.0,t3_t3pr7i,t3_t3pr7i,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

First, the drone. They are physically small. They do not have jet turbine intake or cockpit which are huge radar reflector, and in case of jet engine big IR signature. They are probably wood or fiberglass, not something visible to radar. The propeller is probably also non metallic. 

This would not be enough to hide from radar except for Russian radar design, which is driven by US stealth fighter. You see, US stealth is most effective at high radar frequency. This is also frequency more effective at seeing small objects. So Russian have redesigned radars to better see US stealth fighter, which makes them bad at seeing small objects like drone.

It's as if he thinks it's 1984 and Europe is actively marching on his eastern bloc countries. If it's fear of nuclear weapons being on his border, then there needs to be removal and a new treaty signed... Which won't happen through military action.

It has been nearly 48 hours since the last entry and alot has changed and occurred in this time frame. It feels surreal that it has been less than a week since this whole mess really kicked off in earnest, well at least the most recent invasion phase. Current developments are the catastrophic sanctions and restrictions leveled against Russia by most of the world community and the encircling and ongoing battle for Kyiv and Kharkiv. In the span of 48 hours, Russia has been all but removed from the world forum and finance system or at least with the majority of the developed world. Militarily the Russian military continues to take steep losses against the dug in Ukrainians fighting for their home. One must take actual figures with a grain of salt, knowing that the best possible version is being spun in favor of Ukraine while ensuring only bad publicity for the Russian invaders. As discussed earlier, its not even whether the military exploits of Ukraine are true or not, its the fact that they are believed around the world and accepted as real. Clearly the Ukranians are successfully defending their homeland with a degree of toughness and resolve that frankly was somewhat unexpected by the rest of the world. Sure now everyone can say they knew it would go like this and the Russians would look completely overmatched, but this was not the case in the beginning. However, it was clear from western leadership that this “MUST BE SEEN AS A FAILURE” and that is the most important take away. This dictates the perception of Russia in the world stage and NATO objectives for Russia were clear from the beginning.  Again, whether this is true or not has little bearing, its all about perception.   
  
Putin grows increasingly isolated and his rhetoric has increased in intensity and in outright threats to the rest of the world but specifically towards NATO. He appears isolated, withdrawn, and possibly just plain nuts.  Putin has ordered the readiness of all strategic nuclear forces to be on a heightened alert, essentially telling the world his fingers are on the button if NATO goes one step too far. This of course will not happen and is regarded as propaganda only. However, there was one comment made by a Russian official that basically said if the world does not include Russia, of what use is the world to Russia at that point, basically saying it would be better off destroyed. Let’s get into this developments in more detail.  
  
CURRENT MILITARY SITUATION  
  
While there have been some lulls in the fighting over night Saturday and some of Sunday, it would appear that the fighting is about to enter a new intensity due to the heavy Russian losses in traditional combat with the Ukrainian defense. One could also speculate that there was a decrease in intensity on part of Russian combatants due to the possibility of what peace talks could have amounted to. Russian and Ukrainian delegations met early today regarding a cease fire and possible end to hostilities but no objectives were achieved today save for the scheduling of another round of talks.  
  
Currently a 17KM column of armored vehicles is advancing towards Kyiv based on widely distributed aerial imagery by MAXAR as well as reports on the ground. Some areas of Kyiv and even more so in Kharkiv have experienced intense shelling, missile striks, and pockets of fighting over the past 24 hours. However, despite heavy fighting and a clear Russian objective of taking Kyiv and Kharkiv in an attempt to cut off the eastern half of the country have failed thus far and both cities remain in the hands of Ukraine despite heavy fighting and gains and losses by Russia. This is not to say there have not been Ukrainian casualties, but by all accounts appear no where as large.  
  
Many of the targets over the past 24 hours have been strictly civilian by appearance including the total destruction of a five story dormitory and two five story residential buildings in Vasylkiv and Kalinovka where shelling continues. This has lead to heartbreaking images of injured Ukrainian civilians including children. I speculate that tomorrow at this time we will have learned of much more atrocious and destructive strikes on these major population centers. The reason for that is that by all accounts and measures, Russia is losing this war. As a result, Russia will likely utilize its superior stand off weapon capability that does not require immediate proximity to the areas of battle, allowing them to cause maximum destruction with minimal casualties. They could justify this course of action by claiming that all Ukrainian citizens are active enemy combatants and have been armed accordingly by Ukrainian government. While this in itself is true, I don’t think it will do anything to help the Russian cause, in fact it will simply serve to increase support for Ukraine from the world community. A community that Russia feels less and less a part of by every moment it would seem. Regardless, increasingly isolated, it is totally within realm of possibility that Putin increases the size and scope of his attack, with less regard to loss of human life. As Russia continues to be embarrassed and shamed on the world stage not only for their invasion of Ukraine in itself, but also for their total failure in succeeding up until this point. As I have speculated before, looking like a feeble fool is the worst case scenario for Putin. He would rather be seen as a brutal dictator with an iron fist and as cold as the sickle that crosses it than to look weak and ineffective. His persona is built on this KGB strongman cult of personality that would be irrevocably shattered were he to exit this conflict looking like he does now. Will he let that happen? Does he have a choice? Will we see a change in military doctrine for Russia in the next 24 to 48 hrs? These all are questions the world ponders and watches with baited breath.  
  
Currently Russia has committed an estimated 70% of their total forces amassed into Ukraine. Large convoys appear poised to attempt to take Kyiv and Kharkiv over the next 24 to 48 hours, despite failing to do so thus far. This is further supported as Russian strategy evidenced by the French embassy relocating and the plea for Americans to get out of Ukraine NOW. While they have been urged to leave prior to this, it appears this warning is based on active intel.   
  
It appears that as a result of all sanctions and punishments, that Russian currency has lost half its value overnight as a result and this affects many people including regular Russian citizens both at home and abroad. Russia has been isolated in a way that has not occurred in the current era. This is truly a study into geopolitics and the use of economic measures as a weapon because right or wrong, that is what we are witnessing. Sanctions have long been a tool, but the scope and scale is unlike anything every seen.  Even long standing neutral countries are joining in on the punishment.   
  
There has also been an outpouring of support and supplies to Ukraine from the international community in the form of lethal and non lethal aid. Also many EU countries have quickly established protocols and allowances for Ukrainian refugees that are estimated near 400,000 currently. NATO is doing everything they can to help Ukraine fight Russia without actually physically getting in the fight. Intel, Logistics, Munitions, Weapons, and general support.  
  
I think all of these factors combine to create a really unstable situation. From a military stand point, Russia needs to make some positive gains and the only way they are going to do that is to turn up the heat on causing terror, in an effort to force the Ukrainian president into submission to stop loss of life. Based on the outpouring of support for Ukraine, it seems unlikely they would be left to fail should this take a turn for the worse. Currently the Ukrainians have positive momentum and a successful mounted defense on their side and this allows Ukrainian allies to safely assist from a distance, but what if Ukraine begins to appear like it is losing this fight and that the Russian invaders will win? Would their be direct action?  
  
Conversely there is the possibility that if there is no ground taken tonight, that the Russians just pull back and retreat. Call their banners and head home. Decide that it's not worth it to continue, and that to perform a mea culpa in regards to Ukraine and the rest of the world, and ask forgiveness. It seems very unlikely that Putin is even capable of such a move, since it would shatter his strongman reputation.",False,1646086666.0,t3_t3pr7i,t3_t3pr7i,,0,45,0,45,1,0,

Honestly, there are many steps up the escalation ladder for these kinds of things. The Russians haven't even deployed thermobaric weapons yet, nor have they fully deployed their massed artillery, which can level cities. 

If they do these things and a significant part of Ukraine does not surrender, then chemical and biological weapons are next. If they do these things and still haven't won any major victories, then when can discuss nuclear.

  
What is likely going to happen is that Russia will take the major Ukrainian cities (even if they have to level them and do Stalingrad style fighting to get them) in the east, including Kyiv and Kharkiv, install a puppet government, then declare victory and call it a day and go home. They will paint the legitimate government of Ukraine, now in the west, as the a rebel government.

So ultimately, the only way this goes nuclear is if the Russians don't take any major objectives for months and months, which is not likely. That being said, if it does go that long without any major victory, I think Putin is going to get couped.

>  the U.S.-led campaign to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991 — widely regarded as one of the most successful military operations of modern times — had its supply headaches. For example, the ground portion of the war famously lasted just over four days, but the U.S. Army’s 1st Armored Division nearly ran out of fuel on Day 3 while trying to attack the Iraqi Republican Guard.
> 
> As Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor note in their history of the conflict, crisis was averted only by cobbling together an 18-hour emergency convoy of fuel tankers driven by a hodgepodge of soldiers trained for other jobs.
> 
> There were close calls during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, too. The U.S. Army’s 3rd Infantry Division was supposed to be resupplied two days after the invasion began.

Think cooks, medical, engineers, mechanics, and drivers. They wouldn't send all roughly 60,000 combat troops spread out over three fronts in at once. Some are doing blocking positions, logistic security, recon, fake advances, and resting and refitting. So russia is deploying all that they brought. They have more on the way. They are trying to reinforce this army that's probably in combat about equal or just maybe a little larger than the defending forces.

But I was wondering if folks with deeper knowledge of this could expand further about the differences geopolitically and strategically.

The problem is tritium has a 12 year half life so you need to be producing and loading tritium into these devices on a regular basis to maintain their desired yield. 

Don't get me wrong a fusion (aka thermonuclear device) with no tritium is still a potent nuclear bomb but it goes from being able to level an entire American city to maybe just downtown.

And while they're at it, the U.S. and possibly Japan should conduct massive training and naval exercises in Northern Japan to Russia's Eastern Flank. Wouldn't this put some pressure on Russian and Belarus to deploy additional resources to those borders and strain its resources?

It’d be interesting if someone did a forensic accounting of their defense budget and factor in the costs of corruption. 

What we learned from Chernobyl is that Russians are fucking cheap. They don’t want to spend on quality because they’d rather siphon it off to their wallets. 

Anyway, how much does it cost to maintain a working operational Nuke? Must be a lot. 

Now, let’s insert some classic Russian stinginess. Why pay to maintain a system which it’s only use will serve to bring your own destruction? From a cost-benefit-corruption analysis, it doesn’t make sense to properly pay to maintain and modernize a nuke system. 

It’s cheaper to just pretend you have it. The semblance of having it is enough to shape foreign policy. However, in war, all bets are off and you have to play your cards.

Part of the reason why I think the west feels confident in giving Ukraine all sorts of weapons and support is because they know Putin can’t do shit because he has no nukes. They’re just squeezing every bit of ammo out of him. 

Once they know he’s close to his last bit ammo, I suspect NATO will just go in and call his bluff. He doesn’t have them. Or he has them and NATO knows they are in such shit condition that they’ll never fire. 

And of course NATO this whole time has been playing along with the act, making Russia and the world think that we’re afraid of their nukes….. but for global stability’s sake, we just never said anything. 

Putin forced this on himself and now the West knows he is severely weakened. They just need to keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and ammo and Putin isn’t going to do shit.",False,1646083334.0,t3_t3pr7i,t3_t3pr7i,,0,-33,0,-33,0,0,

I really wish the mods would post links to these when they come out. Too many people are ignoring the dire situation in the south and east, with large amounts of Ukrainian soldiers in danger of being cut off, and every time someone points out how dangerous the situation is, people scream at them that they are full of it. Well here you go, not some rando on twitter but an extremely well respected academic institute that studies war in depth. 

**Key Takeaways**   
  
* Russia deployed additional heavy forces and artillery that it has so far failed to employ in assaults on Kyiv to the city’s western approach on February 27-28. Russian forces will likely launch a renewed assault on western Kyiv on March 1.    
* Russian forces began using heavy artillery against central Kharkiv on February 28, indicating a dangerous inflection in Russian operations as the Kremlin chooses to use air and artillery assets it has held in reserve to date.  
* Russian forces resumed limited advances in northeastern Ukraine on February 28 after an operational pause on February 26-27.
* Russian and proxy forces resumed assaults on Ukrainian forces defending Mariupol from the east and deployed additional artillery and anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) assets to the Mariupol front line on February 28. Russian forces may attempt a renewed assault on Mariupol in the coming days.    
* Russian forces increasingly targeted Ukrainian airfields and logistics centers on February 28, particularly in western Ukraine. Russia likely seeks to ground the Ukrainian air force and interdict the ability of Western states to resupply the Ukrainian military.  
* Russian and proxy forces resumed assaults on Ukrainian forces defending Mariupol from the east and deployed additional artillery and anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) assets to the Mariupol front line on February 28. Russian forces may attempt a renewed assault on Mariupol in the coming days.  
* Russian and Belarusian forces may be preparing for an additional line of advance from Belarus into western Ukraine.  
* **Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.**  
* Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.  


**Immediate Items to Watch**  

*     **Russian forces advancing north and east from Crimea threaten to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine if Kyiv does not withdraw them in the coming days.**
*     Russian forces began using artillery against residential areas in Kharkiv on February 28, likely signaling a dangerous new phase of Russian operations.
*     Russian forces face growing morale and supply issues but will likely be able to overcome these handicaps.
*     Russian forces continue to refrain from using their likely full spectrum of air and missile capabilities. The Ukrainian air force also remains active. Russian operations will likely steadily wear down Ukrainian air capabilities and eventually take the Ukrainian air force out of the fight.
*     **Russia has sufficient conventional military power to reinforce each of its current axes of advance and overpower the conventional Ukrainian forces defending them.**",1646086267.0,1646085908.0,t3_t3pr7i,t3_t3pr7i,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Being small and light also means that they're harder to spot on radar. I have nothing to offer on specifics, but radars are really good at detecting objects that are larger, and moving faster relative to the observer (it's easiest to spot something moving towards you or away, but not perpendicular). SAMs are better than aircraft at overcoming this, but have the same basic challenge.

They're also not particularly hot. A large jet engine produces a lot of heat, so they're easy to lock and track with a MANPAD like an Igla which detects heat. These drones use tiny engines and - in some designs - don't use jets.

Buttoned up means all the hatches are closed and fastened. Outside of combat, tanks generally keep many hatches open as it means that the driver has a full field of view not just a narrow slit, and everyone else has a lot more space, especially on Russian tanks. During combat, well, closing and locking your hatches increases NBC and projectile protection but also increases exit time if you're hit. It's a real tradeoff.

A Molotov through an open hatch is devastating. However, even a fully buttoned up tank is vulnerable to a Molotov entering the engine vent though. That's their tactical value.

2. The Russian Army is stronger  inside their borders but lacks the type of military to invade a long distance from their borders.  Basically, they lack the money to afford the logistic equipment the USA does. They made their army big, and tough, but kinda slow and easily exhausted.

3. Russians didn't bring a large enough army to overwhelm Ukraine.  That would have required at least 400K troops to completely overwhelm them. That would have been extraordinarily expensive though and they didn't think they needed it.

4. Rather than attack with their entire large force, they went with a series of smaller scale attacks which allowed Ukraine to ""get their feet under them"". Again, bad intelligence.

5.  The world is supplying ukraine with tons of advanced anti-air and anti-tank weapons which are devastating.  Russia has no counter and Ukraine would have long ago ran out without support.

A conventional explosive has an oxidizer mixed in with the explosive. Makes it easier to detonate, but the potential damage of the explosive is lessened by the inclusion of the oxidizer.

A vacuum bomb is 100% ordinance and relies on oxygen in the air to combust. Because of this, they're trickier to manufacture correctly, as the fuel must be dispersed in a very fine mist to ensure full combustion.

- Connect with other people. It's OK to talk and vent about the current situation and sharing how you feel. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable, it's good to say your fears out loud, it ""releases"" them from you mind in a way. But don't dwell on this topic, again in order to limit negative stimuli.

Another reason why the world is reacting far more strongly now is because the situation is quite different. In Syria, a civil war broke out and Russia came in to support Assad (a bit of a proxy conflict, which has happened before). In the case of Ukraine, a nation state (Russia) is directly invading another nation (Ukraine) with the apparent aim to conquer it's territory or install a puppet government. The further threat of nuclear weapons by Putin further elevates the stakes as well.

*BUCK: Mr. President, in the last 24 hours we know Russia has said that they are recognizing two breakaway regions of Ukraine, and now this White House is stating that this is an “invasion.” That’s a strong word. What went wrong here? What has the current occupant of the Oval Office done that he could have done differently?*  
  
*PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, what went wrong was a rigged election and what went wrong is a candidate that shouldn’t be there and a man that has no concept of what he’s doing. I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, “This is genius.” Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine — of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful. (sarcastic)*  
  
*So, Putin is now saying, “It’s independent,” a large section of Ukraine. I said, “How smart is that?” And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s strongest peace force… We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy… I know him very well. Very, very well.*  
  
*By the way, this never would have happened with us. Had I been in office, not even thinkable. This would never have happened. But here’s a guy that says, you know, “I’m gonna declare a big portion of Ukraine independent,” he used the word “independent,” “and we’re gonna go out and we’re gonna go in and we’re gonna help keep peace.” You gotta say that’s pretty savvy. And you know what the response was from Biden? There was no response. They didn’t have one for that. No, it’s very sad. Very sad.*

There is also international criminal law. Putin has committed the crime of aggression by launching an illegal war, and any Russian war crimes on Ukrainian territory are within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC).  
  
But Putin will not stand trial before the ICC for aggression, due to the court’s narrow jurisdiction.  
  
Uniquely, the aggressor state and the victim of its actions must both accept the Rome Statute (the treaty that established the court) and its jurisdiction over aggression. While Ukraine has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction, Russia is a not party to the Rome Statute.  
  
So, the ICC has no jurisdiction over Russian aggression without the Security Council referring Russia to the court as a non-party. And, of course, Russia can veto this action as a permanent member of the council.  
  
While the ICC also has jurisdiction over war crimes, tying a president to the crimes of foot soldiers is complex and not something the court has ever succeeded in doing. source: [https://theconversation.com/is-international-law-powerless-against-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-no-but-its-complicated-177905](https://theconversation.com/is-international-law-powerless-against-russian-aggression-in-ukraine-no-but-its-complicated-177905)",False,1646084158.0,t3_t3pr7i,t1_hytwwl2,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Ukraine has very little capability at the moment (will additional fighters and air defenses turn the tide?), other than drones which are difficult to suppress with conventional anti-air and air-to-air tactics.

Here's the categories

* Air supremacy/air dominance (enemy is in state of air incapability)
* Air superiority (enemy is in state of air denial)
* Air parity (enemy is about the same in the air)
* Air denial (operations in the air are highly restricted)
* Air incapability (basically no air capabilities)

I don't think you can make an argument that Ukraine and Russia air forces are in a state of parity over Ukraine.

edit: Some scales have ""favorable air situation"" between parity and superiority.  You could perhaps argue for that, instead.

The Russians were going to assist in some measure against Western forces, but everything about the Korean War was essentially around setting the framework for what atomic age warfare would look like.  Russian fighters were painted the same as either Chinese or North Korean fighters and all the pilots were considered ""volunteers"".  All of this was done to avoid Russia being seen as a true combatant in the war.  The major combatant in Korea would have been Chinese forces that repelled U.N. forces once MacArthur's units hit the border.  That was when MacArthur started asking for authorization to use nuclear weapons, and publicly deriding Truman. This cost MacArthur his job.  It's worth noting that the American's were also trying to make sure that the global dynamic didn't see this as a true ""war"".  Truman famously said ""this is a police action"".  War had a very specific context, especially after World War 2 which was defined by total war. In much the same way, the United States sent lots of material and probably some troops into Afghanistan during the Russian invasion, but was very clear to avoid being actively seen as a true combatant, once again, because of fear of escalation.  

This ""not quite technically at war"" mentality is the foundation of what we know as the Cold War.  Each step designed to undermine the other power, without ever actually being actively at war.
