‚ÄúRemember that things can be reported by legitimate news outlets and good journalists that just turn out to be wrong. (One of the ways you can identify a legitimate news outlet is that it will correct mistakes as rapidly as possible, but mistakes are still inevitable.)
 
‚ÄúBe wary of anyone who is certain about how all of this will turn out, whether in the short run or the long run. No one knows today whether this invasion will be a great success or total disaster for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

His book explains the logic behind Russia‚Äôs strategic moves that we are now witnessing. Read the book for more details but here is an excerpt from the book‚Äôs Wikipedia:


In the 2010s, the conflict between the US and Islamic fundamentalists will die down, and a second Cold War, less extensive and shorter than the first, will take place between the United States and Russia. It will be characterized by Russian attempts to expand its sphere of influence into Central and Eastern Europe, coupled with a buildup of Russian military capabilities. During this period, Russia's military will pose a regional challenge to the United States. The United States will become a close ally to some Central and Eastern European countries, all of whom will be dedicated to resisting Russian geopolitical threats during this period. Friedman speculates in the book that the United States will probably become a close ally of some Central and Eastern European countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Around 2015, a Polish-led military alliance of countries in Central and Eastern Europe will begin to form, which is referred to in the book as the ""Polish Bloc.""

Ultimately, he predicts Russia will fail and collapse but not before trying to become a world superpower again. Eventually the US will have to reenter a Cold War with Russia.

From CNN's Luke McGee  
  
As Western allies work on their coordinated response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there appears to be a real possibility that the European Union might take the controversial step of cutting Russia off from SWIFT, a high-security payment network that connects thousands of financial institutions around the world.  
  
Removing Russia from SWIFT would make it almost impossible for financial institutions to send money in or out of the country. This would seriously impact Russian businesses with foreign customers and could do real damage to the country's economy.  
However, EU nations are split on whether to take this step or not. Senior EU sources have told CNN that there is a divide in the member states between countries like Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania who want SWIFT as part of the sanctions package that will be announced later today, and the likes of Germany, Italy, Hungary and Cyprus, who have stronger economic ties to Russia and do not want SWIFT included in the new sanctions.  
  
A senior EU diplomat said ‚Äúthere is a conversation happening‚Äù but believes it is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù the economic interests will win the argument and Brussels will not cut Russia from SWIFT.

Joe Miller in Frankfurt

Wintershall Dea, one of the European investors in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, says it expects to be compensated for the ‚Ç¨730m it has invested in the project, if political intervention prevents it from being completed.

The German group, which is Europe‚Äôs largest private energy exploration and production company, is one of five companies to have lent money to Russia‚Äôs Gazprom for the production of the gas pipeline, alongside Shell, Uniper, Engie and OMV.

Wintershall Dea is majority owned by German chemicals giant BASF.

On Wednesday, Uniper said it would not seek direct compensation for its investment, which is of a similar size to Wintershall Dea‚Äôs.

‚ÄúI would believe that if anyone would consider legal actions against German government or the EU Commission, it would be Nord Stream 2, the legal entity,‚Äù Uniper‚Äôs chief executive Klaus-Dieter Maubach told reporters.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any reason to believe that they are considering \[any\] such kind of action,‚Äù he added.Engie did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Shell declined to comment.

OMV said it could not comment on compensation, but had a crisis team in place ‚Äúthat continuously analyses and evaluates the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken if necessary‚Äù.

To your question - I don't know the answer for sure, but what I can do is to lay out the larger strategy of what will probably happen in the coming hours.  If you are in eastern Ukraine, chances are that military forces coming down south from Kharkiv will hit the Dneiper, which combined with forces in the vicinity of Crimea will cut off any retreat to the east.

If you are in central or western Ukraine, you have a better chance.  Russian forces are moving quickly to try and take Kiev, and will likely be coming at it from the west and east.  If you retreat to the west, you may run across military forces and fighting that could cause serious harm or death to you and your family.  If you are in western Ukraine, you likely have time and space to head west to safety, especially if you're near Slovakia or Hungary.

If you have expressed anti-Russian sentiments in your online history in the past, or work in a government role, it is likely that once the dust settles from the initial invasion, the Russians may come looking for you to detain you, or potentially kill you.  If you are an innocent bystander, ask yourself if you would want to live under a regime that launches wars of aggression against their neighbors with no provocation.

It is a risk to be a refugee, to be sure.  But if you're going to make the move, now may be the best time.  Couple of tips - don't attempt to make the journey unless you know you have supplies to do so.  That's food, gas, fresh water, etc.  If you are relying upon gas stations and the like to get fuel resupply, don't, they may not have power or fuel to give you due to attacks.  Stock up on fuel locally before you attempt to make such a trip.

If you do travel, stay away from the cities, power plants, industrial targets, etc.  Cities mean people, people mean other individuals who are thinking the same thing you are.  Stay in the country, away from major transport route, assume that everyone has the same thoughts you do and will try and leave through major highways and transit links.

There's a lot more to consider, but I can't elaborate on them at the moment.  Reminder - time spent to carefully consider your plans is not time wasted.  If you are going to do this, know your route, have your supplies ready, and be ready to not come back in your lifetime.

I'm not condoning *anything* Russia is doing, I think it's terrible, but I do think it's still important to be honest about what's going on.  The video litterally does not show what the missile was targeting.  We know it it's near the building being filmed from, and there are people screaming/crying, but that doesn't even imply they were the target.  Explosions shake buildings.

If there's a roadblock, vehicle, or even soldiers positioned near where the missile landed (an area we cannot see at all in the video) then civilians were not the target, rather they were collateral.  Words have meanings and they matter.  Reckless endangerment is practically the theme of the whole invasion, but we don't need to make shit up or make assumptions either.

He could have driven Ukrainian defenses back with heavy shelling and a smaller invasion force if he was only looking for an expansion of what he had. Instead he mobilized the better part of his main army, positioned it all around the borders, and steadily ratcheted up the threats without any concession to diplomacy.

No. Putin has officially stated they are there to wage war. There are dead soldiers on both sides. At this point he either takes over the country or gets suicided. No number of sanctions will change this. 

Especially since sanctions take time to get into effect. If you block electronics - it will be a year or so before people REALLY notice shortages and 3-4 years before it causes wide range issues as companies find themselves unable to operate. 

If you sanction banks and credit lines - again, companies have some money to operate. They will find themselves unable to find any more funding (and customers) but it will take several months. 

Whereas Ukraine needs several DAYS or at most WEEKS, not several MONTHS or YEARS. Especially since sanctions eventually get lifted, it just takes few years of inactivity. Whereas new territories can last decades. 

And the only way to accomplish that would be a military response from NATO. Now whether this would lead to nuclear annihilation - nobody knows.

What they want for sure is an end to NATO/EU expansion into former Soviet territories.  Ideally they‚Äôd like to get some territories back into their sphere, like Poland and the Baltics, but that‚Äôs more of a tomorrow plan whereas keeping Ukraine out of the Euro sphere is the today goal.

To a certain degree their pretext of a ‚Äúhumanitarian intervention‚Äù into Russian-leaning territories is getting shown as farcical by US and NATO intelligence gathering, but my take is that they will at least want to take hold of the Donbas region and either by force or by internal dissension get a pro-Russian government installed in Ukraine.

Todays attacks have all the hallmark of an opening salvo where the intent is to both weaken Ukrainian defenses and to conceal by fog of war where they‚Äôre attempting to actually make active attacks.  Nearly all of the attacks so far have been at or near Ukrainian military installations, from reports so far.

Personally, I don't think one can be certain either way at this point how it will go. It could turn into a larger conflict, or it could be confined to Ukraine.

My biggest question is how far will Putin's resources (both financial and willingness of troops/Russian people to go along with this) be able to take him? War is expensive, Russia doesn't have unlimited funds, and the world seemingly wants to put pressure on him financially (whether they'll do enough in that regard remains to be seen). How will Russian troops fare against a motivated Ukrainian defense? I know it's predicted that Russia will prevail eventually, but it won't be easy.

If the going is too tough here, the action may pause at just the occupation or partial occupation of Ukraine, and Russia vs the world can exist in a sort of stalemate for quite some time with the West and allies mainly fighting in the form of sanctions.

Do we stop an invasion only to become the invaders? How many nations do you drag into a conflict to not stand idly by.

Its harsh yes but Ukraine is a war Russia cannot afford, its not army vs army, its occupying force vs insurgency, modern armies aren't equipped to fight insurgencies, Russia got a seriously bloody nose to an insurgency in chechnya, they lost to an insurgency in Afghanistan (So did the west).

Are you really in a rush to drag half the world into a war with a nuclear armed state headed by a megalomaniac in the name of not standing idly by, war is cruel, it is evil, it ruins the lives of everybody it touches and to think the idea to this is to throw more boots on the ground into the meat grinder is a very narrow point of view.

I should add I spent 12 years in the British Army, I saw the devastation first hand, buried friends and that was against an 'enemy' that was armed with black market weapons like AKs and RPGs, don't be in a rush to throw young men and women up against this, because throwing two professional fighting forces against each other in this day and age with the technology we have will make the losses incurred during Herrick & Telic for that matter look like childs play.",False,1645710069.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8kqm0,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Thing is that Ukraine isnt a Nato country so it doesnt have any policy on having any other country defending it.

Ukraine was relying on the Minsk agreement to keep russia from attacking it. They even got rid of their nuclear warheads in good faith that Russia would never attack.

US and Nato cannot interfere because of the first clause of not having any political alliance. They are friends and allies and obv. emphatize with the situation but they cant go into the warzone esp. against a country like Russia. 
People already say that USA shouldnt police the world but here is a very good case and reason for why US has to police as there are crazy dictators that do things like take over another country without any respect for the citizens of the country they are invading and their sovereignty.

But the way it seems to be panning out is that sanctions are not going to have any effect. And it seems like the uber rich are also aware of his plan and are not going to do anything. 

So all that to say that will US get involved. At the moment they wont. But as soon as Russia commits atrocities aka criminal - military atrocity then they will come in and basically target putin for criminal act. Thats the only hope we have. And if US is invovled than Nato will have to join in. Good thing to see is that turkey is getting themselves involved as far as offering resources rather than attacking but one small attack on turkey resources make it into a nato war.",False,1645714077.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8qo4q,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In the south, the Russians seem to be advancing without much trouble.

Amongst that, numerous reports of downed russian jets, helicopters, tanks, BMPs. Not much reporting of ukranian hardware losses outside of a military transport plans and a bunch of tanks in the south.

Enemy going into unfamiliar territory is hard when resisting force are on home ground.

EDIT: Urban warfare is where the casualties come. It's the most difficult warfare there is.

You can't show up with 2000 tanks because firs two or three gets destroyed and block the street. Now you have to maneuver back and find another way. And now you're in crossfire because there were another group of resisting soldiers behind you. Now those 2 tanks maneuvering behind are destroyed and blocking your way out.

EDIT2: My take is that Russian have a small chance to invade Kiov. They can either bomb the city like afghanistan or they engage in urban warfare which will take a long time.

NATO is a defensive alliance but one of their major stipulations is that their members never engage in offensive war. NATO's major countries have circumvented this(in a bullshit way obviously) by just never declaring war, but that was under the guise of fighting terrorism, etc. rather than fighting a unified non-NATO country(much less Russia, which has 1000 nuclear weapons pointed at the US that can land in 30 minutes or less)

Russia has maintained for the last 70 years that they would not attack NATO, but if NATO touches them they would rather pull the nuclear trigger than try to beat all of the NATO militaries. They have made clear they believe they cannot beat the combined might of NATO but are happy to just end the US, UK, and France to ensure they do not get destroyed without retaliating. That may have been a bluff 60 years ago but they have said it enough times that the US will immediately presume nukes if NATO gets into any battle with Russia whatsoever. Any NATO ally attacking Russia means we are probably within a few hours of Russia, US, UK, and France being gone as we know them. That paradigm has been on the table for 60+ years. Every US president has been briefed on the fact that if Russia ever gets in a battle with a NATO ally it is understood that we have a ""mutually assured destruction"" scenario that has essentially been discussed until it is common knowledge by all parties involved. Russia has pulled the ""We will just blow you up"" card too many times to EVER go back. The immediate assumption will be that they are going to, which means we will, which means they will.

I hope that makes sense, but in summary:

**If Poland throws a rock across the border we may be hours or minutes away from 1000 nuclear strikes on US soil many times larger than Hiroshima. That is not to mention essentially the elimination of the UK and France from the face of the earth. Think about that before you say things like this.**",1645714113.0,1645713803.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8ugny,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

We'll see our visitors off [the retreating survivors of the Napoleonian Great Army] and then we'll rest. The Tsar won't forget your service. It is hard for you, but still you are at home while they- you see what they have come to,""* said he, pointing to the [French] prisoners. *""Worse off than our poorest beggars. While they were strong we didn't spare ourselves, but now we may even pity them. They are human beings too. Isn't it so, lads?""*

>He looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter and brighter with an old man's mild smile, which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.

>*""But after all who asked them here? Serves them right, those mo----fu--ers!""* he cried, suddenly lifting his head.

The end of the world as we know it is on the table if a NATO ally is caught attacking Russia. 1000 Russian nuclear bombs can reach London and Paris in 15 minutes and the US in 30. And that is if they fire them from the ground in Russia -- the number only goes down from there.

This is not a regional conflict where you only have to start worrying when they're figting your neighbors. This is not WW2. Russia, China, France, the US, and the UK are the world's nuclear powers. Russia and China are independent, but the other 3 are NATO. The reason the cold war happened is that Russia and NATO have been terrified of throwing a stone at each other for the last 70 years. The Ukraine situation, like the many wars under the umbrella of the cold war, is one that NATO allies just have to sit back and watch.

China is the only country with a ""no first launch"" policy -- they claim they will not ever launch nuclear weapons unless they are attacked directly. So basically all of geopolicy and war on earth is framed on ensuring that Russia and NATO allies never directly have conflict because it would mean the US, UK, France, and Russia will probably all be destroyed.",1645713400.0,1645711779.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8q5f1,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Attempting to air out everything in public was a hope that not being able to hide in the shadows and deceit that Russia usually operates within would scare Putin out of hitting the go button, and it turns out that even when the whole world is watching he just doesn't care, he only needs the ability to lie to his own constituents to justify this aggression.",False,1645716596.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8l5ym,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Ultimately, the vast majority of the Napoleonic wars were defensive responses on the part of Bonaparte. War of the third coalition: Britain breaches the terms of the treaty of Amiens, violating international law, and then declares war onFrance (seizing all French shipping in her ports and attacking merchant vessels). Austria then in 1805 plots with Russia, Sweden and the UK to cross the Rhine and invade mainland France, as she is concerned with French influence in Italy, and loss of honor in previous defeats. Austria invades Bavaria, a French ally, and Napoleon strikes quickly, destroying the Austrians and then the Russians at Ulm and Austerlitz. Prussia was going to join Austria and the rest, but balks once Napoleon defeats them in battle. War of the Fourth Coalition: Prussian court decides to go to war with Napoleon in early August, 1806. They send Napoleon an ultimatum in October (it was tantamount to a declaration of war, the ultimatum was intentionally designed to be impossible to respond to before the deadline). Napoleon strikes and destroys the entire Prussian army in a week. Then he defeats Russia at Friedland, as they had come to the help of their ally, and grants the Russians an unbelievably generous peace. Peninsular War: Spain, a French ally, had plotted to switch sides if Prussian beat Napoleon, and he gets the King to abdicate and puts his brother on the throne. Spain is in massive disarray on top of this in the first place. War of the Fifth Coalition: Austria decides on war early in 1809, and secretly rebuilds its army and deploys it to the field. Napoleon basically implores them to not go to war, as he definitely doesnt want one (like in 1805 and 1809), plus he doesnt have any troops to stop them (basically). Austria invades Bavaria (again), but Napoleon quickly counterattacks and by july Austria signs another peace treaty. The Russian debacle is borne out of a falling out between the two powers, Russia kept breaching the terms of the treaty they signed (and Napoleon did too). Its important to remember the Russian army literally had war plans starting in 1810, and originally planned to attack Napoleon's allies by striking at Warsaw and invading Poland (a state Napoleon reconstituted after it had been dissolved by the Russians, Austrians and Prussians. Thus.... 1812 campaign in Russia and the war of the sixth coalition. the 1815 100 days is actually an interesting case of international law, as the Congress of Vienna basically had no legal basis upon which to declare war on France. Napoleon returned and literally took over the country with less than a 1000 men because the Bourbon monarchy he overthrew was so utterly disastrous and incompetent and oppresive, which, actually is a lot like what happened to Ukraine in 2014.",False,1645710885.0,t3_t0al6b,t1_hy8m8ji,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

>Putin has waited eight years to recognize Dontesk and Luhansk People‚Äôs Republics as Russian providences after the beginning of the Ukrainian civil war in 2014. These territories which have been run at times by actual socialists still holding out post-USSR have declared themselves Russian and not Ukrainian years ago. They do not want to be part of a government with an active neo-Nazi army branch or be part of a unipolar liberal matrix. Putin is just now recognizing their sovereignty because Ukraine wants to join NATO and help further the interests of western imperialism. **Russia peacekeeping what is historically Russia is not aggression.**  (emphasis mine because, yikes)
 
>Anyone who understands Atlanticist imperialism or world history can identify the US and NATO as the primary aggressor in their funding and prepping of neo-Nazis for advanced gureilla warfare, and wanting to relaunch their nuclear weapon program. Online leftists in the Occident are unfortunately so clueless that they are too gullible to know how to differentiate between state department narrative and geopolitical reality.
>The funny part is just knowing leftists hating each other is exactly what the CIA has always banked on.

For comparison, at that point, Germany was *already* generating far more with renewables than nuclear.

Reality is, nuclear wouldn't have done jack shit for them in this situation. It would take well over a decade to get anywhere near close to plugging the fossil fuel gap, probably more like 20-30 years.

Full disclosure, I‚Äôm a military historian and I am in no way saying aggression must always be withheld. (And I went to UNC, and there is no gray area here, Clemson sucks! Just kidding of course, I much appreciate the polite and informed conversation.)

Without getting into the the specifics of this conflict, what led me to post was the extreme jingoism that I obviously have studied but never witnessed first hand. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre looking around Reddit too and must have noticed some of the ideas and opinions are truly insane. And then upvoted.

The idea that such an educated population as Germany was in the late 20‚Äôs, could be swayed to such a heinous ideology, is pretty fascinating. But of course we can just attribute it to the full spectrum dominance of media that Goebbles et al enjoyed‚Ä¶keep saying the same thing over and over again and eventually it will be believed. 

I hoped that with world wide access to an incredible amount information at our finger tips and the ability to come to a ‚Äúplace‚Äù like this and share opinions and ideas with strangers from all over world, that we had moved beyond that possibility. Now I know I was totally wrong; so wrong in fact, it now paradoxically seems easier?!

My side is righteous and pure and your side is the embodiment of evil. That‚Äôs about as much nuance as it seems people have time for these days. I was glancing around YT earlier and saw a thumbnail that said something like ‚ÄúUkraine: everything you need to know about how we got here‚Äù and it was under 3 minutes. Instead of people doing the deep dives necessary to grasp life altering issues, they just go to their Facebook page and read the news blurbs that feed their bias. News is more of a distraction, ‚Äúwhat do I need to know so I can get back to the Kardashians‚Äù. The result (I believe) is where we are now‚Ä¶there‚Äôs so much shock and so many threads of people asking for an explanation and wondering how this could ever happen. While I, and perhaps you as well, have seen this coming for quite a while now. I kept thinking cooler heads would prevail but similar to the environment prior to WW1, I just don‚Äôt think people could fathom what could actually happen. Now with politicians seemingly more concerned with their polling data than trying to solve a crisis, I fear that this ‚Äúbeast‚Äù may control its master and decisions made to appease a blood thirsty voting block could  very easily lead to us all being vaporized.

The classification is awaiting some official statement in my opinion. But in the context of answering the original question posed (why don't we isolate them like NK?) the answer I provided was because those ""friendly"" countries are unlikely to change their trade agreements, at least for now, so you can't just ""isolate"" them as easily as you can NK.

SA as been growing cozy with Russia for months, and has not publicly voiced any more than ""encouraging calm and deescalation?"" Words are pointless. Actions speak volume. Saudi Arabia has an oil deal with Russia right now at the expense of exports to US. Walking away from Russia would mean less profits selling to the US since supply is higher now that you've cut out a buyer. They are going to have to decide.

So, once again, in the context of the original question, it's nearly impossible to be truly neutral here. Either you support Russia taking over other countries or you don't.

More distressingly, the researchers estimated that burning more coal led to local increases in particle pollution and sulfur dioxide and likely killed an additional 1,100 people per year from respiratory or cardiovascular illnesses.
