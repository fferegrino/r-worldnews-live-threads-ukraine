They’re saying that it appears covid changed Putin in some fundamental way.  Putin was expecting Zelensky and his administration to flee immediately and that Kyiv would welcome Russia with open arms once he and his administration fled. Zelensky is the reason these sanctions came down so hard, so quickly. His resolve shook the EU awake. Germany in particular made an about-face on foreign policy that should be recognized. Putin miscalculated the financial sanctions, he had piggy-banked $630 billion to support the ruble but that money is frozen and now useless in efforts to offset the effects. He was unwilling to flatten Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities because it would undercut his narrative that Ukraine is actually part of Russia, although it appears he’s changing his mind and may very well flatten Ukraine with carpet bombing. There is a discussion of nukes but the belief is that right now is posturing.

a9a81c607b265493166a5b5dadd855eb,t3nw38,hytfis8,"So, I have been poking around about the mercenaries in Ukraine, specifically former SOF. There's a good background article[^1](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3nqb5/ukraine-war-foreign-fighters) on this issue you should all check out.

If you all remember, Zelensky called for a mandatory curfew [^2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60539122). The reason why was due to the fact that there were assassins sent out to kill him and other government officials as well as his own family.[^3](https://intelnews.org/2022/02/25/01-3159/) This is not the first time this has happened. Back in September, there was an assassination attempt on one of Zelensky's aides.[^4](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2021/12/24/what-we-know-about-remote-control-assassination-attempt-in-ukraine/?sh=20a81624c3fd)

So, back to the mercenaries. There's a sizeable group in Kyiv right now from the United States, France, and UK[^5](https://www.instagram.com/p/CahBNC-sK5y/). I have been trying to find out if there are any former JTF2 members in the group, but it seems like there aren't any at the moment. Why is this interesting? Because they are made up of former SEALS, Green Berets, 75th Rangers, SAS, SBS, SASR. If you scroll through that guy's profile, you can see various patches denoting these kinds of connections. There are even some in Kherson right now. [^6](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/t2ry59)

Now, obviously, they aren't going to give away any details of their assignments or roles in Ukraine. But one thing they do very well is ambushing and forward observation. ~~It would not surprise me if they were getting direct intelligence from their native government intelligence agencies as well, despite no longer being enrolled by them~~[~~^7~~](https://thehill.com/policy/international/russia/595916-us-employs-unusual-intel-strategy-to-counter-putin). Indeed, Russians are getting first-hand experience of what that kind of military training, skill, and intelligence is like when they were confronted by foreign attackers.[^8](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarVideoReport/comments/t2qg90/russian_invaders_tell_with_horror_how_ukrainians/)

What does this have to do with Zelensky's curfew mandate? Well, it appears that one of the reasons for implementing the curfew was to snuff out any saboteurs.[^9](https://www.politico.eu/article/russian-saboteurs-spark-suspicion-solidarity-in-ukraine-kyiv/) It would not surprise me if the other reason was to utilize these SOF to isolate and hunt down assassins using the western mercenaries, including the one linked on Instagram. These guys are there to hunt, as they have fought against them in the past[^10](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html). They aren't there to just play war.

Turkey controls the straits under the 1936 Montreux Convention, which stipulates that in a time of war Turkey may block access to warships belonging to states bordering the Black Sea, providing they are not returning to their permanent bases there.

Turkish officials including Çavuşoğlu declared yesterday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine constitutes a war, a shift in tone after officials previously described it as a “military operation,” even while condemning Russia’s actions.

According to the convention, Black Sea nations must notify Turkey eight days in advance of their warships, including submarines, transiting the straits while warships belonging to other nations require 15 days notice. The decision to block ships could affect an estimated 16 Russian warships and submarines currently in the Mediterranean, some of which are part of their Black Sea fleet.

Following a meeting of his cabinet, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated earlier today that “we have decided to exercise the authority granted to our country by the Montreux Convention regarding vessel traffic on the straits in order to prevent the escalation of the crisis.”

Erdogan has repeatedly offered to mediate between Russia and Ukraine, amid efforts to maintain its alliances with both parties. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas from Russia and previously bought Russia’s S400 missile defense system, but has recently enhanced its economic and defense ties to Ukraine, including selling Kyiv Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones.

“Throughout this process, we have maintained our multifaceted diplomatic initiatives uninterruptedly to ensure peace and stability, and we continue to do so,” said Erdoğan.

*Director, Russia Studies at CNA. Senior Adjunct Fellow, CNAS–:*

&#x200B;

>Long thread about how I think the first 96 hours have gone, still very early/incomplete impressions. The initial Russian operation was premised on terrible assumptions about Ukraine’s ability & will to fight, and an unworkable concept of operations. Moscow badly miscalculated. 1/  
>  
>The Russian operation was focused on getting to Kyiv quickly, forcing a surrender, and pushing a small number of units forward quickly in a way that avoided large engagements with UKR forces. They’ve been skirting major cities, going for key road junctions/smaller towns, etc. 2/  
>  
>Why did Moscow choose this course of action? A few theories: they didn’t take Ukraine & its military seriously. They wanted to avoid attrition & devastation because of consequences for pol goals in Ukraine, costs of casualties, and they want to hide the costs from the public. 3/  
>  
>It is also possible that Russian military planners genuinely wanted to avoid inflicting high levels of destruction given how unpopular this war was going to be at home. Most Russian soldiers are young & have little interest in fighting Ukrainians as an opponent. 4/  
>  
>What I’ve seen so far suggests that Russian troops were unaware they would be ordered to invade, and appear reluctant to prosecute this war. They don't see Ukrainians as adversaries and the military didn’t prepare them for this campaign. Outside of Chechens, morale seems low. 5/  
>  
>This is an unworkable concept of operations. It seems they tried to win quickly and cheaply via 'thunder runs,' hoping to avoid the worst of sanctions & Western outrage. They’ve ended up in the worst of all worlds, trickling more resources into a failed strategy. 6/  
>  
>However, this is barely a few days into the war. Ukraine has done remarkably well, but no analysts (except maybe in Moscow) expected Russia to defeat  the largest country in Europe within 4 days, especially given UKR military capability. 7/  
>  
>On the shambolic effort - Russian units are not really fighting as BTGs. They’re driving down roads in small detachments, pushing recon & VDV units forward. Tanks often by themselves and vice versa. Fires & enablers not used decisively, and often not used at all. 8/  
>  
>Outside of the fighting NW of Kyiv we have a lot of smaller detachments, tanks, IFVs, often recon or VDV units pressing down roads & into cities. Small formations regularly outrunning logistics, without support, or letting support & artillery get ambushed behind them. 9/  
>  
>Beyond large numbers of units strewn out in small detachments & checkpoints, we have the inverse situation as well. Long trains of Russian vehicles stuck in their own traffic jams, entering across the border. Air defenses not covering them, but stuck on the road with them. 10/  
>  
>As companies & platoons run ahead to seize points, logistics can’t keep up, and they’re not being effectively covered by support. Most of the fights I've seen are small skirmishes, especially on the outskirts of major cities. These may be intense, but not major battles. 11/  
>  
>The Russian failure is driven by the fact that they’re attempting to conduct a full-scale invasion without the mil operation that it would require, thinking they can avoid most of the fighting. This has led to not only unworkable force employment, but lack of employment. /12  
>  
>The truth is that large parts of the Russian military have yet to enter this war, with many of the capabilities still unused. Not to take away from UKR great mil performance, and resilience, but I see a lot of early judgments & conclusions that need moderation. 13/  
>  
>In the first 4 days, Russian tactical aviation, except for some Su-25s, largely sat on the sidelines. So have most combat helicopters. They have hundreds of both deployed in the area. Russia's air force is missing in action, and largely unused. 14/  
>  
>The Russian military sought to use cruise/ballistic missiles to destroy/suppress UKR air defense and target air bases. However, they're not flying CAPs, or offensive counter air, and only today have I spotted the first Su-34 bomber conducting strikes. /15  
>  
>Except for heavy shelling around Kharkiv, use of fires have been limited compared to how the Russian mil typically operates. Sadly, I think this will change. Russian mil is an artillery army first, and it has used a fraction of its available fires in this war thus far. /16  
>  
>The bulk of the Russian military has yet to enter the fight. Outside Kharkiv, most of the 1st Guards Tank Army, and 20th Army, are just sitting there. They pushed a few BTGs a considerable distance past Sumy, but I think a lot of Russia's forces are still on the sidelines. /17  
>  
>Another point, Russian losses are significant, and they have had a number of troops captured, but they have been advancing along some axes. In general, Ukrainians are posting evidence of their combat successes, but the opposite is less true, distorting the overall picture. 18/  
>  
>Hence my next thought. In a desperate effort to keep the war hidden from the Russian public, framing this as a Donbas operation, Moscow has completely ceded the information environment to Ukraine, which has galvanized morale and support behind Kyiv. Another miscalculation. /19  
>  
>I won't comment on the host of official claims made in this war so far, except that I think Kyiv is doing a great job shaping perceptions & the information environment. That said, folks should approach official claims critically in a time of war. /20  
>  
>Looking at the military effort, I think Russian forces are getting some basics really wrong, but we're also learning things that are probably not true about the Russian military as well. They're not really fighting the way they train and organize for a major conventional war. /21  
>  
>The assumptions have Grozny 1994 vibes, while some of the operations remind me of classic mil org driven blunders. Sending airborne air assault brigades or naval infantry in early on to 'do their thing,' even though it is unnecessary, risky, or impractical. /22  
>  
>What's next? Russia's political leadership is still not conceding their plan's failure, trying to take Kyiv quickly. But we're seeing them open up greater use of fires, strikes, and air power. Sadly, I expect the worst is yet ahead, and this war could get a lot more ugly. /23  
>  
>I was going to add, that I've seen and read other explainer threads out there about the Russian military failure. I differ with some of those explanations, they're generally not coming from Russia mil experts, and 4 days into a war might be a bit early for conclusive statements.

Prosecutor Karim Khan spoke on Friday, expressing his concerns about Russia’s war on Ukraine and saying that the court could investigate war crimes arising from the invasion.

“The next step is to proceed with the process of seeking and obtaining authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court to open an investigation,” said Khan today about seeking approval to investigate.

Lithuania previously called on the ICC to open an investigation into war crimes committed by Russia and Belarus in Ukraine, with Lithuania’s prime minister, Ingrida Simonyte, telling the Washington Post: “What Putin is doing is just a murder and nothing else, and I hope he will be in The Hague.”

Russian claims of denazification:

Yes the Azov battalion exists, congrats. Stop bringing it up, it's not proof of Ukraine being Nazi controlled. It's a small Authoritarian Right Militia group that was absorbed into the formal Ukrainian army. It is not representative of the country as a whole.Maybe before President Putin claims this idealism of ridding Ukraine of Nazi's, he should look to his own country that created this problem in the form of the RNU. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_National\_Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_National_Unity)

This problem that still persists to this day that apparently is not a problem for Russia but somehow is for Ukraine.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian\_nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_nationalism)

So before you go citing the Azov battalion as an example of Putin's justifications, remember he has yet to solve Nazism in his own country.

&#x200B;

Russian Stock Market:

The stock market is closed today and will be closed tomorrow. They are doing this to prevent the ruble from tanking. This is only a temporary measure and will not actually solve the problem they are facing. Picture it like your car having it's check engine light on and you deciding not to drive it as a way to solve the problem. The problem doesn't go away once you decide to drive it again. The stock market will not miraculously stabilize because Putin kept it closed for a couple days. He staving off the inevitable panic selling that will happen once it reopens.

&#x200B;

Russian Nuclear Escalation:

If you want to be worried about nuclear weapons that's fine. I have my opinions on the likelihood of him launching but lets talk beside that. Lets talk IF Putin launches. There's nothing that can be done. If Russia launches then everyone launches, period. There is no scenario where they use a nuke on Ukraine (even as a false flag from Belarus) that doesn't result in every other nation launching in retaliation. At that point there is quite literally nothing anyone can do.I personally don't think he's dumb enough to launch, or anyone listening to him is dumb enough to obey the order. But IF (and that's a big if) it does happen then it's no one's problem any more. If you manage to survive, good luck. If you don't? So long and thanks for all the fish.

&#x200B;

Russian Military:

There is absolutely no evidence to support the idea that Russia hasn't sent their most capable forces out to fight yet. It would monumentally stupid to do so and drag this conflict out. Doing so results in the sanctions you are seeing today. It was expedient of them to take Ukraine as quickly as possible. The failure of the Russian Military comes down to a few things.

\- The underestimation of the Ukrainian military

\- the resolve of the Ukrainian people and it's leaders

\- The underestimation of the EU's, UN's, and NATO's quick and cohesive response

\- The lack of preparations and understanding of their enemy

\- the poor coordination of their troops and units

\- the poor maintenance of their tanks and planes

\- the poor training and condition of their troops overall

\- the arrogance of Putin- the people under Putin refusing to object to anything he says

&#x200B;

What is Putin's endgame:

He wants to restore the land and economical power of the former USSR without having communism. He wants to be a primary power on the world stage. If you listen to him his words smack of old school, cold war soviet posturing. He's a strong man needing to display strong man tendencies. That means challenging the power of NATO by taking non-NATO countries. It's pretty simple.

&#x200B;

What about Russian peacetalks:

There is no scenario where Putin can have a successful peace talk and walk away any form of winner. Zelensky will not capitulate on anything, NATO will not just let Putin do what he pleases anymore, and Putin can't walk away with nothing without potentially losing his position or worse his head. The peace talks are just there for Putin to shrug his shoulders to the Russia people and say ""Well guys, I tried"". Anything he demands will be absolutely outrageous and unthinkable for Zelensky to accept. Anything Zelensky demands Putin will see as a loss and refuse to agree too. We are getting into Sunk Cost Fallacy territory now with the types of losses the Russian military is experiencing.

The far right rhetoric in many countries has been steadily amplifying and pushing xenophobic, racist, isolationist, and militaristic ideals. I don't think this will put an end to that, but seeing the vast majority of the world united like this does provide a compelling answer to those (largely nationalists) who think globalization makes us weak. It introduces many problems, but it also provides many solutions, and we're witnessing the most potent of those solutions now.

In effect, this is World War 3, except beyond Ukraine it's only being fought via politics, culture, and economics. Global systems of interconnectivness have become so intrinsic to prosperity that the exclusion of one party from the system is in many ways far more damaging to that party than a bunch of countries sending their kids over to kill each other.

We don't know what Putin is thinking for sure, but there's a lot of alarming comments here:

>Some quotations first and a few comments at the end:The author calls this a “new era.” “Russia is restoring its historic unity: the tragedy of 1991, that terrible catastrophe of our history, that unnatural aberration, has been overcome.”  
>  
>The main issue was “the complex of a divided nation and a complex of national humiliation, when the Russian House began to lose part of its foundation (the Kievan one) and then was forced to reconcile itself to the existence of two states of not one but two peoples.”  
>  
>The answer? Kill Ukraine's sovereignty.“Now this problem no longer exists: Ukraine has returned to Russia. This doesn’t mean that its statehood will be liquidated but it will be re-structured, re-established and returned to its natural condition as part of the Russian world…  
>  
>The author gives no agency to Ukrainians as people. He twists himself in a knot asserting that “brothers still shoot at each other, even though they have been divided only by their membership of the Russian and the Ukrainian armies.” It's regrettable fratricide, folks.",1646077742.0,1646077410.0,t3_t3nw38,t3_t3nw38,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

> The Russian operation was focused on getting to Kyiv quickly, forcing a surrender, and pushing a small number of units forward quickly in a way that avoided large engagements with UKR forces. They’ve been skirting major cities, going for key road junctions/smaller towns, etc.
> 
> Why did Moscow choose this course of action? A few theories: they didn’t take Ukraine & its military seriously. They wanted to avoid attrition & devastation because of consequences for pol goals in Ukraine, costs of casualties, and they want to hide the costs from the public
> 
> It is also possible that Russian military planners genuinely wanted to avoid inflicting high levels of destruction given how unpopular this war was going to be at home. Most Russian soldiers are young & have little interest in fighting Ukrainians as an opponent
> 
> What I’ve seen so far suggests that Russian troops were unaware they would be ordered to invade, and appear reluctant to prosecute this war. They don't see Ukrainians as adversaries and the military didn’t prepare them for this campaign. Outside of Chechens, morale seems low
> 
> This is an unworkable concept of operations. It seems they tried to win quickly and cheaply via 'thunder runs,' hoping to avoid the worst of sanctions & Western outrage. They’ve ended up in the worst of all worlds, trickling more resources into a failed strategy

Turkey on Sunday officially recognised Russia's attacks on Ukraine as a ""state of war"" and said it was implementing an international treaty giving it the power to limit warships' passage through the strategic Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits.

""It's no longer a military operation but a state of war,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said.

""In this case, of course, whichever of them, it can be Russia or Ukraine, we apply the Montreux agreement.""

1. The Russian military was just on exercise in Belarus. Exercise is tiring since you're basically simulating operations. Long hours, little sleep, physical exertion, etc. His military is tired already and now they have to actually go to war and it's proving to be too much.
2. Logistics are shit. Putin thought Ukraine would fall in a day or two and the sight of the Russian military would make them afraid and retreat immediately. Ukrainians have a much stronger national identity than Putin thought and they're putting up a hell of a fight and are equipped with modern equipment happily sent to them by the US and other allied nations.
3. Putin thought his propaganda machine would be enough for the Russian troops to do what he wanted and fight hard. The troops are finding a very different situation on the ground where they are being yelled at and cursed for invading Ukraine instead of being praised for liberating it by the locals. The resistance they're meeting from both the Ukrainian military and locals is magnitudes higher than they expected. All of this combined leads to an extremely demoralized force that has lost a will to really fight besides personal defense.  


The three bigger factors lead to what might have been a super powerful army being absolutely worthless on the field. The issue against Ukraine is Ukraine doesn't have the numbers to resist invasion for long and Putin doesn't have the money to keep it going for long either. It's a race to see what will break first; the Ukrainian military or Putin's bank. 

My money is on Putin's bank personally. I don't think he could ever think of taking all of Ukraine and will only get maybe half of it before Russia runs out of money and China either has to help him finance it or he will have to evacuate since the Ukrainian's in the East will likely resort to insane levels of Guerilla warfare.",1646077595.0,1646077508.0,t3_t3nw38,t3_t3nw38,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

If it is true that the 17-mile convoy has air assets protecting them, then it makes more sense to take out assets that are going to the convoy in order to reduce the convoy's effectiveness. Really really damn smart use of intelligence because now the convoy close to Kyiv can't gain any traction. They'll be bogged down further and maybe get impatient and do something stupid. 

It also buys some time for Kyiv to continue buffing up her defenses and for supplies to get into the city. 

We're in for a big fight and Ukraine plus Western Intelligence Agencies are doing a masterful job of shutting down Russia's supply lines.

2: Putin wants very much to explore small scale nuclear warfare and the apparent ""failures"" of the last few days are his planned pretext to open up the gates for such an unprecedented action. The apparent unforced errors were intentional and will be manipulated into an excuse to start using tactical nukes. This will start slow, like boiling a frog but by the end of the year Russia will have begun nuking basically every country currently not a part of NATO/UN.

3: Putin has indeed begun to lose his mind or has been suffering from a terminal illness and his health is affecting his leadership and long-term plans. 

4: The broader world has successfully won the intelligence and morality war. Putin and his highest advisors have been misled at every level and his generals and military may actually even be acting in bad faith to Putin's interests.

An 1963 classic and one of the best movies of all time. A Stanley Kubrick masterpiece satirizing global nuclear conflict between the US and USSR. Funny as hell and a nice reminder of what your parents and grandparents were mostly worried about. 

[War Games](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) 1983. Ferris Bueller accidentally starts WWIII. I won't spoil the classic line at the end. 

[The Day After](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085404/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3) 1983 attempted to show us what it would be like to survive a nuclear attack. Aired on TV with 62% of Americans tuning in, making it the highest rated TV movie of all time until 2009. Scared the shit out of everyone. 

[The Manhattan Project](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091472/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4) 1986. Not really about nuclear war, but it's a fun movie about a kid who builds a nuke!

People say that Hungary refuses to support Ukraine and that we support Russia's actions towards Ukraine. THIS IS NOT TRUE! I cannot stress this enough. Hungary does in no way support anything that Russia is doing right now. Both the common people of Hungary and it's government CONDEMS Russia for what they did/are doing.

To the people who're saying that Hungary doesn't support Ukraine. We DO support Ukraine's fight against the Russians. We are actively taking in as many refugees from Ukraine as we can. We are also sending supplies like food, fuel and medical supplies. Hungary only refused to let weapon convoys through.

There are multiple reasons for this.

1) The government fears, that the convoys would come under attack while they're in transit through Hungary. While I don't fully agree with this, I must admit, that it would give Russians a valid reason to unleash hell on our country.

2) Hungary wants to remain as neutral as possible in this conflict. Personally I don't agree that we should remain neutral, but you also need to take it into account that Hungary is a neighbouring country to Ukraine, and if things go south, we don't really stand a chance against the Russians. Which brings me to point number 3.

3) Hungarian military is yet to be fully modernised. Until 2015, we only had really old weapons (mainly Ak based weapons which were produced in the 1970s), and old military vehicles, so we are not really on par with the Russians. And because we are located so close to them, we have to play it safe so we won't be among the first ones to be annihilated, if Putin does decide to start World War 3.

4) Hungary is dependent on Russian natural gas. It's sad but it's a fact. If we lose the gas we receive from Russia, Hungary will be fucked. The majority of people would't have anything to heat their homes with and a lot of companies would go bankrupt, leading to an economic depression.

So to anyone reading this. We DO want to help Ukraine. We are doing the best we can. We are trying to help out any way we can but there are a lot of concerns that simply cannot be ignored. A lot of us don't agree with the decision not to let weapon convoys through, but ultimately the choice is not ours, but the governments. So I think it's unfair of you to judge the whole nation based on the choices of our government alone.",False,1646077711.0,t3_t3nw38,t3_t3nw38,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

The comments here paint the picture of things being as bright as they can be (given the situation), but much of this is based on information sources sympathetic to Ukraine. Let's face it, even the good guys must partake in propaganda during war. All reports from all sides have to be taken skeptically, especially at such an early stage. 

Add to this that, had I imagined a hypothetical Russia-Ukraine war back in say November, before it became our sad reality... it would intuitively seem to me that Russia should have the major advantage, just from the disparity of size, population, resources, military numbers and so on between the two nations. 

This all makes me worry that Ukraine's position is not close to as sunny as we might hope.

We hear reports of Russia doing more poorly than expected, and these reports seem accurate. Russia isn't getting the cakewalk they had bargained for. The pushback on the international stage is also clearly way more than they expected. On the other hand, we also see reports that Russia is not close to using the full brunt of its force.

I remember opposing the Iraq war in 2003. I remember doves back then were called cowards, fascist sympathizers, and appeasers. Today even opposing a gigantic increase in defense spending (like what Scholz is doing) will get you called the same with the added bonus of Russian bot or Putin’s pet. 

I [remember](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/the-vindication-of-barbara-lee/380084/) congresswoman Lee being the sole vote in both the senate and the house to vote against the 2001 authorization of military force act. She was derided by the media from the wsj to WaPo. She got death threats and was asked why she hated America. And yet 2 decades later history has proven her right. She was the sole voice in Congress, she like me were just the few who stood athwart history yelling stop! 

Today I’m doing the exact same thing that congresswoman Lee and I and many others did during the war on terror. I am yelling stop. To stop the insane military budget increases instead of spending money on social welfare. To stop or at least lessen the military aid when it could be spent right here in America. Joe Biden was elected by the people of Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. not by Kiev, Odessa, or Kharkiv. Shouldn’t he focus on the vulnerable Americans first? 

I know I will be downvoted (like before) I know I will be screamed at and called coward/ appeaser/ naive (like before) but I wasn’t wrong back in the early 2000s and I don’t plan on being wrong now.

Since the beginning of the special operation to protect the inhabitants of Donbass , the Russian armed forces have hit 1,146 objects of the military infrastructure of Ukraine . This was announced on Monday, February 28, by the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Major General Igor Konashenkov.  
The influence of the environment: a threat has been created to the most powerful grouping of Ukrainian forces  
On the fourth day of the operation to protect Donbass, several settlements in the DPR were liberated and foreign weapons were seized  
“Since the beginning of the special operation, the Russian armed forces have hit 1,146 military infrastructure facilities. Among them are 31 command posts and communication centers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, 81 S-300, Buk M-1 and Osa anti-aircraft missile systems, as well as 75 radar stations,” Konashenkov added.  
Six columns of armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) were destroyed by the operational-tactical aviation of the Aerospace Forces (VKS) of Russia, the major general said.  
“311 tanks and other armored combat vehicles, 42 aircraft and helicopters (including on the ground), 51 multiple rocket launchers, 147 field artillery pieces and mortars, 263 units of special military vehicles were destroyed,” the Defense Ministry said.  
Konashenkov said on the same day that the Russian military is cooperating with the administrations of many cities in Ukraine, and by mutual agreement, law and order is jointly ensured.  
Transport continues to work, life support facilities are functioning , the representative of the department specified.  
Civilians of Kiev can freely leave the city , Konashenkov stressed. He also spoke about the situation in the Ukrainian capital, noting that ""armed bands of marauders, robbers and nationalists are rampaging in the city.""  
On February 26, a representative of the department stated that mass and uncontrolled distribution of weapons to the population continues in Ukraine . Civilians, he said, are given automatic small arms, grenade launchers and ammunition.  
The situation in Donbass escalated on February 17, 2022. The DPR and LPR reported heavy shelling by Ukrainian security forces, including from heavy weapons. The republics announced a general mobilization and evacuation of civilians to the territory of Russia. On February 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DNR and LNR), as well as treaties of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with the republics. The documents were ratified the next day.  
On February 24, Putin announced the start of an operation to protect the civilian population of Donbass. After that, Zelensky accused Russia of hitting the country's military infrastructure and introduced martial law throughout Ukraine. He also said that Kiev is breaking off diplomatic relations with Moscow and withdrawing its diplomats from the embassy.  
On February 28, negotiations between Russian and Ukrainian representatives took place in the Gomel region of Belarus . According to the head of the delegation of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Medinsky, during the meeting, which lasted about five hours, all items on the agenda were discussed in detail. A second round of negotiations is expected to take place in the next few days.

The rest is all propaganda, same destroyed Ukrainian vehicles (notice most of them lack Z or V marking) and convoys being shown over and over again as Russian etc. Realistically, the cost to Russia from war itself has been very minimal given the progress they made. The cost of sanctions is unknown but I don't actually think they affect anything strategic, mostly just for show.

The offensive of Russia and the new world


Petr Akapov


A new world is being born before our eyes. Russia's military operation in Ukraine has ushered into a new era - and in three dimensions at once. And of course, in the fourth, internally in Russia. A new period begins here, both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.


Russia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia.

Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.


Nationalists in Ukraine are fighting on the recommendation of foreigners, said Putin

Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations. After all, the need to solve it would always remain the main problem for Russia - for two key reasons. The issue of national security, that is, the creation of anti-Russia from Ukraine as well as an outpost for the West to put pressure on us, is only the second most important among them.


The first would always be the complex of a divided people, the complex of national humiliation - when the Russian house first lost part of its foundation (Kiev), and then was forced to come to terms with the existence of two states, not one, but two peoples. That is, either to abandon their history, agreeing with the insane versions that ""only Ukraine is the real Russia,"" or to gnash one's teeth helplessly, remembering the times when ""we lost Ukraine."" Returning Ukraine, that is, turning it back to Russia, would be more and more difficult with every decade – the recoding, the de-Russification of Russians and the incitement of Ukrainian Little Russians against Russians would gain momentum.


And in the event of the consolidation of the full geopolitical and military control of the West over Ukraine, its return to Russia would become completely impossible - it would have to be fought over with the Atlantic bloc.

Putin: the main clashes in Ukraine occur with national formations


Now this problem is gone - Ukraine has returned to Russia. This does not mean that its statehood will be liquidated, but it will be reorganized, re-established and returned to its natural state as part of the Russian world. Within what boundaries, in what form will the alliance with Russia be consolidated (through the CSTO and the Eurasian Union or the Union State of Russia and Belarus)? This will be decided after the end is put in the history of Ukraine as anti-Russia. In any case, the period of the split of the Russian people is coming to an end.


And here begins the second dimension of the coming new era - it concerns Russia's relations with the West. Not even Russia, but the Russian world, that is, three states, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, acting in geopolitical terms as a single whole. These relations have entered a new stage - the West sees the return of Russia to its historical borders in Europe. And it is loudly indignant at this, although in the depths of his soul he must admit to himself that it could not be otherwise.

Russia formed a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine


Did someone in the old European capitals, in Paris and Berlin, seriously believe that Moscow would give up Kyiv? That the Russians will forever be a divided people? And at the same time when Europe is uniting, when the German and French elites are trying to seize control of European integration from the Anglo-Saxons and assemble a united Europe? Forgetting that the unification of Europe became possible only thanks to the unification of Germany, which took place according to the good Russian (albeit not very smart) will. After that, to also swipe(edit: aim after/at) on Russian lands is not even the height of ingratitude, but of geopolitical stupidity. The West as a whole, and even more so Europe in particular, did not have the strength to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence, and even more so to take Ukraine for itself. In order to not understand this, one had to just be geopolitical fools.


More precisely, there was only one option: to bet on the further collapse of Russia, that is, the Russian Federation. But the fact that it did not work should have been clear twenty years ago. And already fifteen years ago, after Putin's Munich speech, even the deaf could hear - Russia is returning.



Yesterday, 18:23

Russia brought an agreement to organize negotiations to Ukraine, said Peskov


Now the West is trying to punish Russia for the fact that it returned, for not justifying its plans to profit at its expense, for not allowing the expansion of the western space to the east. Seeking to punish us, the West thinks that relations with it are of vital importance to us. But this has not been the case for a long time - the world has changed, and this is well understood not only by Europeans, but also by the Anglo-Saxons who rule the West. No amount of Western pressure on Russia will lead to anything. Losses from the sublimation of confrontation will be on both sides, but Russia is ready for them morally and geopolitically. But for the West itself, an increase in the degree of confrontation incurs huge costs - and the main ones are not at all economic.

Europe, as part of the West, wanted autonomy - the German project of European integration does not make strategic sense while maintaining the Anglo-Saxon ideological, military and geopolitical control over the Old World. And indeed, it cannot be successful, because the Anglo-Saxons need a controlled Europe. But Europe needs autonomy for another reason as well — in case the States go into self-isolation (as a result of growing internal conflicts and contradictions) or focus on the Pacific region, where the geopolitical center of gravity is moving.


Yesterday, 19:16

Russia's rights in the Council of Europe suspended


But the confrontation with Russia, into which the Anglo-Saxons are dragging Europe, deprives the Europeans of even the chance of independence - not to mention the fact that in the same way Europe is trying to impose a break with China. If now the Atlanticists are happy that the ""Russian threat"" will unite the Western bloc, then in Berlin and Paris they cannot fail to understand that, having lost hope for autonomy, the European project will simply collapse in the medium term. That is why independent-minded Europeans are now completely uninterested in building a new iron curtain on their eastern borders - realizing that it will turn into a corral for Europe. Whose century (more precisely, half a millennium) of global leadership is over in any case - but various options for its future are still possible. Because the construction of a new world order - and this is the third dimension of current events - is accelerating, and its contours are more and more clearly visible through the spreading cover of Anglo-Saxon globalization. A multipolar world has finally become a reality - the operation in Ukraine is not capable of rallying anyone but the West against Russia. Because the rest of the world sees and understands perfectly well - this is a conflict between Russia and the West, this is a response to the geopolitical expansion of the Atlanticists, this is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world.

No one in Europe wants to fight Russia, French Defense Minister says

China and India, Latin America and Africa, the Islamic world and Southeast Asia - no one believes that the West leads the world order, much less sets the rules of the game. Russia has not only challenged the West,(but) it (also) has shown that the era of Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over. The new world will be built by all civilizations and centers of power, naturally, together with the West (united or not) - but not on its terms and not according to its rules.",False,1646079728.0,t3_t3nw38,t1_hytlhk1,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

He thought Ukrainians would offer little resistance and might even welcome the Russians in some cases. He figured there would be sanctions but the ""war"" part would be over so quickly that they wouldn't last too long.

His end goal was to prove that Russia was willing and able to use military might to stop the expansion of NATO, and he assumed (correctly) that the West wouldn't directly intervene for fear of losing access to oil and/or starting a nuclear war. Even if the puppet regime he installed fell quickly, the message would have been clear that he still ran things in that part of the world, and if any other countries wanted to think about joining NATO he would be happy to depose their leadership as well.

He was right about the West not directly intervening, but he badly miscalculated how quickly he would take the capital, which has kind of ruined the whole gambit. Because now there is enough time for the West's indirect intervention (sanctions, SWIFT, supplying arms) to have a real devastating impact on the homeland, and the longer it takes to topple Kiev's government the worse for Putin at this point. Unfortunately that means fighting is likely to get more and more intense.

It took the USA three weeks to capture Baghdad, and this was with *some* help from the international community. So confident we were that the war was over we had Bush saying ""mission accomplished"" for a war that ended up lasting nearly 20 years and cost the US trillions of dollars and thousands of American soldiers lives. 

Ukraine is no Baghdad, and Bagdhad didn't have the outpour of support of an entire two or three continents worth of sanctions against the US.

I want to make it clear this is a fascinating military ""failure"" because it will be interesting to see if a nuclear power has to be catered to through appeasement (this **also** applies to the US) or if the international community can effectively shutdown and support an undesired conflict without officially declaring war. I still think people are way too optimistic overwriting the current failure of the invasion as if we greatly overestimated the strength of Russia - **clearly if we are funneling billions of dollars into Ukraine to support them** it is *not* that easy. Yes, things like Russia failing to take air superiority are wholly unexpected, but some opinions I've seen on this military failure makes me wonder if anybody read the book on Korea/Vietnam or even the English and Russian versions of Afghanistan. Failure to instantly take and secure another nation, **especially** with a near total shutdown of a country's economy and global connectivity, doesn't magically mean the Ukranians don't have a strong opponent or that the winds of war can't blow in the other direction. 

We're only on day *5*. Ukraine is still not out of Putins crosshairs and I'll be more interested to close the chapter on this strategy when a month has passed.",False,1646080015.0,t3_t3nw38,t1_hytl91m,,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,

>I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.

>This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.
The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.

>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.
It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.

>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.

For example, a lot of people here are very anti-Putin and suggesting that nuclear war is worth it to get rid of Putin. It's not and we need to remember this.

The only reason I half agree with what some right-wingers are saying is because I think they're being slightly more pragmatic about deescalating this in some ways. Agreeing with Russia that Ukraine will remain neutral and will demilitarise, would allow for people to stop dying in this war and take the risk of hundreds of millions dying in a potential nuclear escalation off the table. And honestly Russia isn't even entirely wrong to be concerned with Ukraine joining NATO and the EU. These are genuine risks to Russia's national security in the same way the Cuban missile crisis was to the US.

Obviously I completely disagree with Putin's choice to start a war though, and this is where I completely agree with you. Putin should not start started this war, but now he has we need to find a way to understand each others perspective and come to some trade-off. It's kind of like when you're young and your younger brother/sister wants to play with the same toy as you. Either you compromise or you fight. We need to decide which of these we want to do.

Language is very important in these types of cases. Essentially, unless Russia says: ""We will consider it an act of war if you supply lethal weapons to Ukraine"", nothing really has changed. I'm not saying this isn't a serious situation, but NATO is not looking to provoke a direct conflict with Russia, and Russia while under immense pressure right now and with a very frustrated leadership, is also not looking to start fighting NATO. Any action taken will be measured in the current context and according to established procedures/customs that countries have worked out ways to let each other know what their red lines are.

And it's not as if providing weapons in a proxy war isn't a long standing and established tradition. The Russians and Americans have financed and directly helped each other opponents in hot conflicts for literally decades. The difference here now is that NATO countries are doing it very publicly for domestic reasons, to show their overt support for Ukraine. Usually these things happen in a more low key fashion.

So in this case, when Russia is saying that those supplying weapons will ""bear responsibility"", they are keeping it vague on purpose. Until they say something more direct, it's just grandstanding, meant to make Russia look powerful and instill exactly the type of fear you're feeling right now.",1646077895.0,1646077675.0,t3_t3nw38,t1_hytg3er,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

>It[Crimea] has vast offshore oil and gas resources in the Black Sea, estimated between 4-13 trillion cm of natural gas.  

Not only was Putin cutting off Crimea's resources from being used by Ukraine (meaning they couldn't wean themselves off of dependence on Russia), but he was essentially going to ""double-dip"" by also expanding his own ability to tap into those resources -- Ukraine would be paying for ""Russian"" gas that was extracted from what until *then* had been *Ukrainian* territory.  
  
>Ukraine is now concerned about losing one of the two largest shale gas fields (“Yuzivska field”) in the **Donetsk** and Kharkiv ‘oblasts’ or regions. Ukraine holds Europe’s third largest shale gas reserves. The new regional separatism of its eastern regions also undermines Kiev’s plan to switch from gas to coal, due to its losing 45.6 percent of its national coal reserves.

Donetsk region -> DPR now.  More separatist agitation for the purpose of taking over resource-heavy areas.

Without writing an essay: Even without superior technology, the biggest thing that the US has going for it is that all of our wars are fought over there. Somewhere else that is far from the US. Meaning that we've had a LOT of practice with logistics and have it pretty damn well figured out.

Take the evacuation of Afghanistan a couple months back. The US was able to coordinated hundreds of planes taking off from all over to world to move tens of thousands of people at a moments notice. Not just to Afghanistan, but Plane A takes refugees from Afghanistan and delivers them to a base in Germany. Where they are documented and then placed on Plane B to move them to the next whatever country will accept them. While this is going on Plane C is in route to Afghanistan to pick up more refugees and when they land back at base Plane D is ready to pick them up and move them forward. Just think about the planning and logistics it took to Supply the planes, fuel, food, personal, documentation.... again at a moments notice.

Then compare that to Russia logistics the last couple days.

Ive said this before in these threads but ""Amateur's talk tactics, professionals talk logistics"" - Omar Bradley and there is no country in the world that can match the US logistics and planning.

I don't know where you're hearing your news, but afaik this is pretty much what you said.

Russia is being handed sustained, substantial losses, which is forcing their advance to be slow and grinding. The Ukrainian military is holding out much better than anticipated, and sustaining far fewer losses than anticipated. 

The possibility exists for Russia to escalate further, but the fact of the matter is, right now Russia's supply lines are in shambles. Row after row of convoys are being taken out by either drone strikes or ambushes with anti-tank weapons.

Russia are BLEEDING.  They are bleeding soldiers, they are bleeding good will at home, they are bleeding international relationships, and perhaps most important of all, they are bleeding money.  Their currency is in free fall and that's with markets closed.... interest rates rose 4% over night... 4!  Every single Russian will feel that impact.  Their GDP was basically halved while their reserves and tertiary assets are all being seized.

Meanwhile the Ukraine have incredible resolve and the support of basically the entire world.  If the war stays as it is now, we will start seeing mass capitulation of Russian soldiers on the ground, with more and more of the elite breaking ranks back home.  Every day the war drags on, more and more weapons and soldiers are being flooded into Ukraine.

If the war stays at the intensity it is at now, there isn't a doubt that Ukraine emerges victorious.  If the war ramps up and Russia starts going scorched earth, you will start seeing more and more civilians (and thus nations) willing to put boots on the ground.

ICBM's increase the difficulty because they fly much higher, and much faster, and come from much further away.  Also: stakes are much higher (failure can mean the nation that launched it gets nuked to ash); so it's worthwhile to use countermeasures (stealth, decoys, etc).  

So; Anti ICBM systems have been used a few times in tests, and have had some successes and failures.  If they were 100% bulletproof, you'd see the USA acting with much more confidence and impunity. For example, they probably would be droning Russian invasion force into scrap right now, and flying A-10 missions. Since we don't see this, it can be inferred that US strategists do not want to risk having to try to intercept an ICBM and fail.

The other issue is Submarine-launched ballistic missiles (or cruise missiles).  It's possible that some Russian subs are parked just off the coast.  The launch point and flight time of these missiles is going to be completely unknowable until the missile gets high enough into the sky for radar to detect.  It's very possible that many coastal cities could get hammered in the space of about 15 minutes.  Some missiles might get intercepted. But not likely all.

They go into space and cover the atmosphere with aluminum on their way down, making radar detection almost impossible.

With all the radar problems due to the aluminum and the dummy warheads, there's a significant change one of the real ones will hit it's target.  Chances are they aren't firing at just *one* target either.  They'll target DC, New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles at the same time, while other warheads are targeting nuclear weapons arsenals to prevent retaliation.

The complete failure of Russia (then seen as one of the European great powers) to defeat the Japanese--who were seen as genetically inferior by the Russians was a major factor in the decline of the Russian monarchy.  The Russian aristocracy essentially started the war to get an easy win against what through their racist logic was an inferior enemy.  They thought that this would stabilize the regime and give a patriotic win which would bolster the monarchy and paper over the problems with land distribution and labor that had been festering for years (essentially Russia had failed to sufficiently modernize and get rid of the last vestiges of the feudal era and we running at least a hundred years behind the rest of Europe in this regard). They quickly learned that they were wrong, that not only were their racist beliefs wrong, but that Japan had modernized substantially to the point where they were able to sink most of the Russian navy.

The question is, can Russia afford the capital to wage this war long term? I don't think so. Moving that portion of the army was costly in fuel and keeping it stationed until the invasion was costly in food.  


Now we are finding Russian troops looting grocery stores and abandoning tanks on the side of the road for lack of food and fuel.  


I have no illusions that if Russia had begun the invasion differently, we might be seeing a very different story today where Kyiv fell Saturday and the Russians are advancing on Cherkasy today. Instead, the war started this way and the tactical and strategic mistakes made which have allowed Ukraine to resist the Russian Army so well is costing Russia money which is needed to keep his army moving.  


No money for troops, troops don't invade. Troops don't invade, Ukraine wins. Ukraine wins, Putin appears weak to Russia. Hell, he's already dragged Russia's economy down this far and arrested over 1k protestors. He doesn't want to get in a war with NATO or he would risk seriously losing any control over Russia which is what he really wants. Power and control over Russia and it's neighbors.  


Take what I say with a grain of salt, of course. But realize that any war costs a lot of money and any lack of money costs a war.",False,1646078390.0,t3_t3nw38,t1_hyth8sv,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

a.

b. Do something absolutely abhorrent to Ukraine, to which Ukraine will agree to more demands to avoid greater death, and then settle himself into his Ural mansion while Russia falls apart under international embargo.

c. Escalate to nuclear warfare that effectively destroys the way of life of 90% of the planet.
