> **Kyiv ratchets up pressure on west to bolster its air force so it can repel Russian air strikes**

> The US is working with Warsaw on a deal to provide Ukraine with Polish fighter jets as Kyiv ratchets up the pressure on the west to help boost its air force capabilities so it can repel Russian aerial attacks.

> The deal would involve Ukraine receiving Russian-made warplanes from Poland, which would then be given American F-16s by the US to refill its stocks. It comes amid fears Russia will increase air strikes given the slow progress of parts of its ground campaign.

> The White House said it was negotiating with Poland and consulting other Nato allies but that there were “a number of challenging practical questions, including how the planes could actually be transferred from Poland to Ukraine”.

> “We are also working on the capabilities we could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine,” a White House spokesperson said.

> The Polish defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

> The deal emerged following a day of intense pressure from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and his foreign minister, who both said if Nato will not institute a no-fly zone over the country then it should provide its air force with fighter jets.

> The Financial Times reported earlier on Saturday that Zelensky had made an emotional plea for the US to give Poland and other eastern European allies F-16 fighter jets, enabling those countries to then send Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine.
> Ukrainian pilots need Russian-made aircraft because those are the systems they have been trained to fly.

> In a call with almost 300 US lawmakers on Saturday morning, Zelensky said Ukraine badly needed more aircraft, particularly after Nato decided against creating a no-fly zone because it would risk a broader conflict with Russia, according to people familiar with the call.

> Washington is working to provide more support to Ukraine and this week started sending anti-aircraft stinger missiles, the same weapons that the US provided the Mujahedeen to repel the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.

> One US lawmaker who took part in the call said Zelensky had expressed appreciation for the stingers, but said they were insufficient because they were not able to fly high enough to take out some Russian aircraft.

> The US and allies have supplied a range of weapons to Ukraine. But they are worried Putin would view the provision of warplanes as an escalation, which he might interpret as Nato effectively entering the conflict against Russia. Earlier on Saturday, Putin said Moscow would consider the institution of a no-fly zone by any third party as “participation in the armed conflict”.

> Polish president Andrzej Duda has previously said sending planes would be tantamount to interfering in the conflict.

> One person familiar with the situation said the Biden administration had previously indicated to Poland that the US could not provide it with American fighter jets. The White House denied the US had opposed the idea to send Russian-made fighters to Ukraine, saying it was “a sovereign decision for any country to make”.

> Brendan Boyle, a Philadelphia Democratic congressman who participated in the zoom call with Zelensky, told the Financial Times there was broad bipartisan support in Congress to find creative solutions. He pointed to the example of the US passing the Lend-Lease Act during the second world war to make it easier to provide countries with war supplies and weapons.

> “We have to start looking at analogies to the Lend-Lease Act in terms of a 2022 version of it for Ukraine,” Boyle said. “There is . . . popular American support for doing everything we can to arm the Ukrainians. Politically speaking, this is a relatively easy lift.”

> Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba made a similar plea during a meeting on Saturday with his US counterpart Antony Blinken along the Poland-Ukraine border, saying it was “no secret that the highest demand that we have is in fighting jets, attack aircraft, and air defence systems”. 

> Kuleba added: “If we lose the skies, there will be much, much more blood on the ground, and that will be the blood of civilians.”

> Asked if the US would consider the request, Blinken said “we are talking about and working on everything”, adding that US defence secretary Lloyd Austin was working closely with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksii Reznikov.

> Zelensky opened the call with US lawmakers with a 20-minute plea for more American support. At one point during his emotional presentation, he paused to ask one of the American lawmakers to mute themselves.

> “Senator Rick Scott, please mute your mic,” said the Ukrainian leader, who was dressed in his customary T-shirt, according to one person on the call.",1646525196.0,1646525054.0,t3_t7m2bv,t3_t7m2bv,,0,116,0,116,0,0,

No, today wasn't a Ukrainian cakewalk but a few really impactful events occurred.

Russia lost a lot of aircraft. An almost unprecedented number for a modern military in a single day.

First day that the territory held by Russia didn't substantially increase.

First recapture of urban areas from Russia by Ukraine.

Emerging evidence that Russian supply levels of certain munitions are running critically low.

Ukraine has captured more vehicles than it has reported losses, but that doesn't mean it's a useful gain. Many will be in need of repair or not relevant to current Ukraine strategy, nor do they necessarily have the fuel to sustain them.

First evidence that the effects of sanctions are starting to hit - worker unrest at plants in Russia, disabling of aspects of card transactions, Aeroflot pulling all non domestic flights unless they go to Belarus because of closed airspace + maintenance sanctions + ATF shortages limiting how much and how far they can fly.

US works with Poland to provide Ukraine with fighter jets

>The Financial Times reported earlier on Saturday that Zelensky had made an emotional plea for the US to give Poland and other eastern European allies F-16 fighter jets, enabling those countries to then send Russian-made warplanes to Ukraine.  
>  
>Brendan Boyle, a Philadelphia Democratic congressman who participated in the zoom call with Zelensky, told the Financial Times there was broad bipartisan support in Congress to find creative solutions. He pointed to the example of the US passing the Lend-Lease Act during the second world war to make it easier to provide countries with war supplies and weapons.

Russia: a view from the inside. Personal business brought me to Moscow at the beginning of February (good timing, I know) and I ended up spending 4 long weeks on the other side of the Ukraine conflict. Now that I've crossed the border into a place where I can speak freely, I want to share what I saw and heard. Spoiler: It's bad. Really bad. When I arrived in Moscow, I felt like the proverbial frog that got tossed into a pot of boiling water. There I saw 144 million other frogs that had been sitting in the pot for 22 years. I yelled at the crazy frogs ""Why don't you jump out?"" and they all looked at me like I was the crazy one and said ""You've been lied to. Boiling water is the ideal environment for frogs."" It didn't make sense at first. Well educated people that I have known my entire life were saying absolute nonsense. Like deja vu, I kept having the same conversation word for word (no joke, really word for word) with different people, as if everyone memorized the same text.  For some reason seemingly apolitical topics, like Russian classical literature, kept prompting angry anti-Western monologues. And then it dawned on me - what we're dealing with is the world's biggest cult. Yes, a cult. The people on the other side of the Ukraine conflict have been brainwashed, trapped in an intricate and extraordinarily effective web of Putin's propaganda. Few of them can read foreign media, most of them have lost sight of reality and what seems outlandish to us, makes perfect sense to them because narratives have been written for them and historical facts reinterpretted to fit those narratives. Remember the Jim Jones followers? The ones who willingly drank cyanide-laced Kool-Aid? That's the level of cult we're dealing with. A small, but  important nuance is that the Russian people have not been conditioned to be loyal to Putin. Believe it or not, Putin is secondary. They have been conditioned to be loyal to the greatness of Mother Russia. According to the rhetoric, Russia is (and has always been) a victim of the imperialist West. If it were not for constant attacks on it's sovereignty, the traitorous dissolution of the Soviet Union and constant interference from said Western imperialism, Russia would be the great nation it deserves to be. People will often tell you that they don't support Putin and don't believe the propaganda on TV. Then they immediately proceed to spew the official party line of ""the world is treating us unfairly"", ""the West put us on our knees, but we will get up and be strong"" and ""we must protect the Russians in Ukraine from Nazi oppression"".  And if your opinion doesn't fit into that world view? Well, then any good Russian will happily inform you that you are a victim of Western propaganda. Naively, I thought this would change when Russia invaded Ukraine. I couldn't imagine that a whole nation of people could do anything other than condemn Putin's unprovoked attack on an innocent nation. I thought it might be the beginning of his end. And it is true that at first Russians were as shocked as the rest of the world. Maybe even more so, because while Western media spent all of February talking about Russia's plans, Russian media was busy making the West look stupid and hysterical, claiming all the while that there was nothing to worry about. Very quickly, however, the Russian population came around to the idea that it was necessary. So where are we today? Lots of Russians truly believe that Ukraine was a threat to Russia's national security and the ""special military operation"" (the words ""war"" or ""invasion"" are illegal now) in Ukraine was necessary for the denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine. They believe that Ukraine is run by a Nazi government and was developing nuclear weapons. They also believe that the Russian military is carrying out strategic, targeted attacks on military targets while all is quiet in cities. Yes, Russians don't know (or don't want to believe) that their military is shelling Kyiv and Kharkiv. Any photo or video evidence thereof is immediately labeled as a fake and as of a few days ago, distributing fakes carries a prison sentence of up to 3 years. They are fed images of the great Russian military fighting for the people of Luhansk and Donetsk, of the humanitarian aid that is being provided to refugees of those regions, of all the support and Russian flag-waving. No mention of any other fighting anywhere else in the country. The official party line is ""everything is going well"". And sanctions? They're just another example of how Russia is a victim of the imperial West (where were the sanctions when US invaded Iraq). So now what? I have no idea. The people are past the point where a simple conversation and some logic will change anyone's mind. Sanctions are going to bring the economy to its knees, but they will not turn  anyone against Putin (Putin is not to blame, you see, it's the evil West that ruined our economy). And I'm not even sure that a change of leadership would achieve anything. What needs to die is the idea that Russia is a victim of Western imperialism. And how do you kill an idea? The best way to describe my last month - I feel like I got a glimpse into 1938 Germany, complete with Hitlerjungen (Yunvoyny in Putin's Russia) and adapted for the nuclear age. This is the first time in my life, when I began to understand exactly how the Holocaust happened. So what the hell do we do? To wrap up the monologue, I do understand that this does not describe every Russian. I know there are people that oppose the war, that understand that Putin's obsession with strength and power ruined the country's future, that see through the lies. Sadly, I know they are in the (very small) minority.

https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1500197460626624513

Bellingcat (award-winning investigative journalists focused on Russia) says in the above thread that their FSB contacts say it sounds plausible. Bellingcat is a reliable source, which makes this leak interesting.

Even so, grain of salt, etc. Here's a rough translation of the text of the leak:

---

I’ll be honest right away: I have hardly slept all these days. Almost all the time at work my head is floating, as if it were in a fog. And sometimes I'm overworked and convinced that none of this is real.

To be honest, Pandora's Box is open. A real global horror will begin by the summer - global famine is inevitable (Russia and Ukraine were the main suppliers of grain in the world, this year's harvest will be smaller, and logistical problems will bring the catastrophe to a peak point).

I can't tell you what guided those at the top when deciding on the operation, but now they are methodically lowering all the dogs on us (the FSB). We are scolded for analytics - this is very much up my wheelhouse, so let me explain.

Recently, we have been increasingly pressed to customize reports to the requirements of management - I once touched on this topic.  All these political consultants, politicians and their retinue, influence teams - all this created strong chaos.

 Most importantly, no one knew that there would be such a war, they hid it from everyone. Here's an example for you: you are asked (conditionally) to calculate the possibility of human rights protection in different conditions, including if prisons were to be hit by meteorites. You specify meteorites as insurance for calculations, they tell you nothing like this will really happen.  You understand that the report will be just for show, but you need to write in a victorious style so that there are no questions. They ask, why do you have so many problems, did you really work badly?  In general, a report is being written that when a meteorite falls, we have everything to eliminate the consequences, we are great, everything is fine.  And you concentrate on tasks that are real - we don’t have enough strength anyway.  And then suddenly they really throw meteorites and expect that everything will be according to your analytics, which weren't to be taken seriously.

That is why we have a total clusterfuck - I don’t even want to pick another word. There is no protection from sanctions for the same reason: well, it’s quite possible that [Russian Central Bank head] Nabiullina will be accused of negligence (rather, the switchmen from her team), but what are they to blame for? No one knew that there would be such a war, so no one prepared for such sanctions. This is the reverse side of secrecy: since no one was told, then who could calculate what no one knew about?

[Chechen leader] Kadyrov is going crazy. And his anger almost started with us: perhaps even the Ukrainians threw in misinformation that it was we who handed over the routes of Kadyrov's special forces in the first days of the operation.  They were marching without cover, they had not yet begun to fight, and they were simply torn to pieces in some places. Off we go: it was the FSB that leaked the routes to the Ukrainians. I do not have such information, but I will still give it a 1-2% chance of being true (it cannot be ruled out at all either).

The blitzkrieg failed. It is simply impossible to complete the task now: if Zelensky and the authorities were captured in the first 1-3 days, they seized all the key buildings in Kyiv, they gave them the order to surrender - then yes, the resistance would subside.  In theory.  But what's next?  Even with this ideal scenario, there was an unsolvable problem: with whom to negotiate?  If we depose Zelensky, well, with whom should we sign agreements?  If we sign agreements with Zelensky before we depose him, those papers are worth nothing.  The opposition party refused to cooperate: [Ukrainian Opposition Leader] Medvedchuk is a coward, he fled.  There is a second leader in that party - Boyko, but he refuses to work with us - even his own people will not understand him.  They wanted to return [separatist leader] Tsarev, but even our pro-Russian people turned against him.  Return [former Russian puppet] Yanukovych?  But as?  If we say that Ukraine is impossible to occupy, then any of our authorities will be killed there in 10 minutes, as we leave.  Occupy?  Where are we going to get so many people?  Commandant's offices, military police, counterintelligence, security - even with minimal resistance from the locals, we need 500 thousand or more people.  And that's not even counting logistics.  There is a rule that by using a high quantity of management to make up for poor quality, you spoil everything.  And this, I repeat, would be with the ideal option, which does not exist.

 What now?  We cannot announce mobilization for two reasons:

 1. Large-scale mobilization will undermine the situation inside the country: political, economic, social.

 2. Our logistics are already overstretched today. Our contingent would be many times larger, and what will we get?  Ukraine is a hefty country in terms of territory.  And now the level of hatred towards us is going through the roof.  Our roads simply won't be able to handle such supply caravans - everything will come to a standstill.  And we won't manage to recover - because it's chaos.

And these two reasons occur at the same time, although even one is enough to break everything off.

Losses: I don't know how many there are.  Nobody knows.  For the first two days there was still control, now no one knows what is going on there.  You can lose large units in communication.  They can be found, or they can be attacked and dissolve.  Even the commanders may not know how many of them are running around somewhere nearby, how many died, how many are in captivity.  The number of deaths is definitely in the thousands.  Maybe 10 thousand, maybe 5, or maybe only 2. Even at the headquarters they don’t know for sure.  But it should be closer to 10.  And that's without counting the [separatist military] - they do their own accounting.

 Now, even if Zelensky is killed, captured, nothing will change. Ukraine is like Chechnya in terms of hatred towards us. Even those who were once loyal to us are now against us.  Because it was planned from above, because we were told that this wouldn't happen unless we were attacked.  Because they explained that it was necessary to create the most credible threat in order to peacefully agree on the right conditions.  Because we were initially preparing protests within Ukraine against Zelensky.  But these didn't account for our direct entry. Our invasion, to put it simply.

 Further civilian losses will increase exponentially - and resistance to us will also only increase.  They already tried to enter the cities with infantry - out of twenty landing groups, only one had a conditional success.  Remember the assault on Mosul - after all, this is the rule, it was the same for all countries, nothing new.

 Keep under siege?  According to the experience of military conflicts in the same Europe in recent decades (Serbia is the largest testing ground here), cities can be under siege for years, and even function.  Humanitarian convoys from Europe will arrive there in a matter of time.

 We have a conditional deadline of June.  Conditional - because in June we have no economy left. Nothing will remain.  By and large, next week there will be a turning point in one of the sides, simply because the situation is stressed to the breaking point.  There are no analytics - it is impossible to calculate the chaos, no one can say anything for sure.  Act intuitively, and even on emotions - but this is not poker.  Rates will rise, in the hope that suddenly some option will shoot through.  The trouble is that we, too, can now miscalculate and lose everything in one move.

You can’t even make a “dirty” bomb without someone noticing.

That said, these are issues that can get fixed. Putin won’t back down and will continue to send more troops, more equipment, more rockets and bombs until he gets what he ultimately wants. 

For instance, the current situation in Kharkiv and Marioupul are goddamn humanitarian disasters. These cities are getting beaten to crumbs and Russia is committing war crimes left and right. 

The reality is that things have become delayed in Russia’s timeline due to so many issues - but Putin will find a way to bring the travesties that are occurring in the east and spread this to all cities and villages across Ukraine.

Can we really take that as an indicator for the outcome or is it still more common that a way bigger army makes it, even if they ""fuck up""?

For **ANYONE** still suggesting that NATO ""just get in there already"".  We get it, you are frustrated, and think the world isn't doing enough.  It sucks.  You want the strong to protect the weak, no matter the cost.  The problem is, we are facing a real life ethical nightmare. It's called ""The Trolley Problem"": 


>The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.  


https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/trolley-problem-moral-philosophy-ethics


In this case, Russia is the Trolley, the 5 people represent the world at large, and the 1 person represents Ukraine.  This is the decision the world faces in a very real sense.  


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read / view the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

It's comforting for a couple reasons, one because MAD ensures that nuclear war is *very* unlikely, that's the obvious reason, but also because there's an additional sort of comfort to MAD, that being the ""not my problem"" effect. At the height of MAD if nuclear war had begun most if not all of humanity would have been vaporized in an instant, meaning the effects of the war wouldn't actually be felt by humanity. While death is scary, there's a certain calming effect it brings to humans.




Much scarier than death is having to deal with the consequences of a post-nuclear war. If we assume that Russia's significantly reduced supply of nukes combined with the United States' missile defense systems would mean the world could survive a nuclear war then that means MAD is gone and nuclear war becomes viable and, arguably, even likely. It also means that should nuclear war happen we as individuals will have to face the consequences of probably the worst war humanity has ever had, we won't even have the calm of a quick instant death to ease our minds. This is why we want to cling so desperately to MAD even as experts are beginning to suggest MAD is either going away or already gone.

I recognize that's not exactly what you're saying but it's close and I've heard it from others as well. Ukraine can move the government to Lviv and continue the war. Although Zelenskyy is a huge morale boost, even if he's lost with Kyiv the government must have a chain of succession ready to go. Lviv is right next to the Polish border, so it would have a short supply chain to the West and plenty of room for a long defense since it's far from the front lines. 

So assume Russia bombs Kyiv to the ground and then takes it over. Congrats, you have a pile of rubble, took a lot of losses, Ukraine/international people hate you and the war continues. I don't see an incentive at that point for Ukraine to agree to a ceasefire that doesn't punish Russia more than they're willing to accept. US/Europe won't agree to anything either.

All that said, I don't really see any winning scenarios for anyone at this point. Ukraine/international won't agree to anything that doesn't involve crippling penalties against Russia. Russia won't agree to anything that will make it appear that they 'lost'.

First two letters are the manufacturer, su is Sukhoi, TU is Tupolev, mi is mig.

Su 34 is a gen 3.5 fighter, better avionics, arguably better weapons than a 27 but would likely get smacked by a modern f-16, 18, etc. 

Russia does not do the banning standard the US adopted where F is fighter, B is bomber, R is recon etc. So you'll need to look up each plane to see it's 'role'

Russia should be better matched if it were their su-34s against the UA mig 29s in a vacuum as they should have a longer radar and weapons range. However, the advantage goes to the defenders over land if the inbound fighters are well tracked the defender can build a mission profile to intercept them and land safely.

Ukraine has been keeping them concealed and periodically moving them, which means their air defense, while not particularly strong, is mostly intact.   And for some reason, Russia seems incapable of tracking down the launchers and destroying them.  


So that means Russian planes have to fly low, below RADAR.  It's what they've been doing.   Except that's the envelope in which Stingers operate.  Ukraine has had Stingers this whole conflict, but more and more of them are pouring into the country, so I suspect even that avenue is going to start closing up.

&#x200B;

When you couple those factors with what appears to be a very small amount of flight-worthy aircraft versus the claimed amounts *(many serials of crashed aircraft match known, documented examples of aircraft seen operating in Syria, implying the same small pool is being used, and Ukraine even captured one of the Russian pilots that participated there and was prominent enough to get a photo op with Assad)* you end up with what we're seeing.   The relatively low number of viable airframes Russia seems to be able to field is too risky to deploy in Ukraine in large numbers, because their operational safety is very suspect.   Ukraine's air defense isn't strong enough to guarantee that if something flies into it, it dies...but it's very much not *safe.*  Hence all the tepidity.",False,1646536685.0,t3_t7m2bv,t1_hzj5m4a,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

4b954d2569080147221f33fb85c8c702,t7m2bv,hzihd2d,"By and large, the country has no way out. There is no option for a possible victory. We 100% repeated the beginning of the last century [the Russo-Japanese War], when we decided to kick weak Japan and get a quick victory... then it turned out that our army was in trouble. They started the war to the bitter end, then they began to take the Bolsheviks for ""re-education"" into the army - after all, they were outcasts, uninteresting to anyone in the masses.  And then, the Bolsheviks, who were not really known to anyone, picked up anti-war slogans and it all started...

 From the pros: we did everything so that even a hint of the mass sending of ""penalty boxes"" to the front line did not pass.  If you send convicts and ""socially unreliable"" political prisoners there (so that they don't mess with public opinion inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go into the negative. The enemy is motivated, terribly motivated.  He knows how to fight, there are enough middle-level commanders there.  There are weapons.  They have support.  We will simply set a precedent for human loss in the world.  And that's it.

 What we are most afraid of: at the top, they act according to the rule of overlapping the old problem with a new problem.  Largely for this reason, the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis, it seems, should have drawn all the attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining.  But there were even bigger problems.  Then they decided to push Erdogan on 4 pipes of the South Stream [a Russian pipeline through Turkey] and we entered Syria - this is after Soleimani lied in order to solve his problems.  As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with the Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung with another headache (if we go out, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it’s also difficult and useless to sit).

 I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian Blitzkrieg"". If we were given real input on the original plan, we would at least indicate that it would be controversial, and that there is a lot to double-check. A lot. Now we're up to our neck in shit, and it's not clear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not clear goals, because they do not have clearly defined parameters by which one can determine the level of accomplishment or non-completion of the task.

 Now it remains to be seen if some fucking adviser will convince the top to start a conflict with Europe demanding they reduce sanctions or we declare war. But what if they refuse? I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like Hitler in 1939. Then our Z will turn into a new swastika.

Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike?  Yes.  Not for military purposes (it will not do anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others.  At the same time, the soil is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - [spymaster] Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging to prove that Ukraine secretly created nuclear weapons.  They are now hammering on what we have long studied and dismantled: you can’t draw evidence here on your knee. The presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is nothing. The production cycle is such that you can’t do it without someone noticing.  You can’t even make a “dirty” bomb without someone noticing. Ukraine's old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (plants like REB-1000 produce it in minimal quantities as a “by-product” of the reaction) - but the Americans got the IAEA involved, so sucking on that topic is stupid.

 Do you know what will happen in the next week or two?  Sanctions will hit us so hard that we will start to miss the hungry 90s.  While the stock market was closed, Nabiullina seemed to be taking normal steps - but this is all like plugging a hole in a dam with a finger.  It will still break through, and even stronger.  Nothing will be decided in 3, 5, or 10 days.

 Kadyrov beats his hoof for a reason - they have their own adventures there.  He created for himself the image of the most influential and invincible.  And if that image falls once, he will be taken down by its own people. He will no longer be the owner of the winning horse.

 We go further.  Syria.  ""The guys will hold out, everything will be over in Ukraine - and there in Syria we will again strengthen everything in positions.""  And now, at any moment, they can wait there for the contingent to run out of resources. Turkey blocks the straits - and to transport supplies there by air is like heating a furnace with money.

 Notice that all this is happening at the same time. We don’t even have time to bring everything into one heap.  We're beginning this in a situation equivalent to Germany in 1943-1944. 

Sometimes I am already lost from overwork. Sometimes it seems that everything is a dream and it's all as it was before.

 In prisons, by the way, it will be worse.  Now the nuts will begin to tighten until we see bloody ichor, everywhere. To be honest, purely technically, this remains the only chance to keep the situation - we are already in the mode of total mobilization.  But you can’t stay in such a regime for a long time, and we have ambiguity with the timing and it will only get worse for now.  From mobilization, management always goes astray.  You can run a hundred meters in a sprint, but it’s bad to go to a marathon and begin sprinting with all your might.  Here we sprinted with the Ukrainian question as if we were running a hundred meters, but we are truly running a cross-country marathon.

 And that's what I said very, very briefly about what's going on.

For the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.

 Firstly, there is more than one person making a decision, at least someone will balk.  There are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".

 Secondly, there are some doubts that the nuclear arsenal is even functioning properly.  Experience shows that the greater the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. But there is no transparency. I'm not sure if the red button system works as advertised.  In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.

 Thirdly, and this is the most vile and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the readiness to sacrifice oneself of a person who does not let the members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers, come close to him.  For fear of the coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter.  If you are afraid to let the most trusted people near you, then how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones, inclusive?

 If anything - ask, but I can not answer for several days.  We are in a rush mode, and there are more and more tasks.

 In general, our reports are peppy, but everything flies into the clusterfuck.

We know the Russians are bleeding equipment at an unsustainable rate and that their logistics in some areas is very bad and they might have issues if Ukraine can counter attack.

We don't know what their logistics situation is.  We know they've lost a lot of equipment, but we also know they likely haven't been able to convert captured Russian equipment to replace it yet.

To answer your last point- yes. Logistics are vital in a war and there are plenty of examples of troops dying of disease, starvation, and exposure as opposed to enemy fire, because of shitty logistics.

Edit: should note that the Russian advance has been slower than expected (according to leaked documents, the Russians expected to take Ukraine in 15 days), and Ukraine obviously has superior support lines for the west.

The bottom line is that there is an quickly shrinking ""window of opportunity"" that Putin must face.

All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Contact with the aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER, was lost when it was about 50 km (31 mi) from the Ukraine–Russia border, and wreckage of the aircraft fell near Hrabove in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, 40 km (25 mi) from the border. The shoot-down occurred in the War in Donbas in an area controlled by pro-Russian rebels.

 >The Russian bounty program is an alleged project of Russian military intelligence to pay bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing American and other allied service members during the war in Afghanistan. The existence of the alleged program was reported in the media in 2020 and became an issue in the 2020 presidential election campaign. In June 2020, The Washington Post reported that intelligence suggesting the existence of a bounty operation dated to as early as 2018. The Washington Post and Associated Press both reported that Trump administration White House officials were informed of the intelligence reports in early 2019.

While an investigation is being undertaken by the UK Electoral Commission, the UK Parliament's Culture Select Committee and Intelligence and Security Committee, and the United States Senate. ""The Russia Report"" published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in July 2020 did not specifically address the Brexit campaign, but it concluded that Russian interference in UK politics is commonplace.

Ukraine will suffer some serious losses, and there may be some brutal stories (looking at Mariupol for the last week, but it was the NPP a few days ago).

However I'm cautiously optimistic for Ukraine because of the following reasons:

1. Russia adding troops isn't really going to do much but chew through logistics faster. There's a concept I forget the name of but it's basically Army density in an area and how without force multipliers, the addition of more troops has exponentially diminishing and then negative returns.

2. The aid/supplies, weapons and troops that are rushing in to Ukraine take time to have an impact on the Battlespace.

3. Zelenskiy is calling for closed airspace constantly but without Russian Air Power being the force multiplier it should be which indicates Ukraine has some gas in the tank ready for something.

4. Ukraine still hasn't completely played it's hand and neither has Russia (Air Force), both could be waiting for Ukraine to make a significant move.

This war is not going to be short, but if you know your opponent has serious logistical issues, to maximise the impact on them, you want to draw them in...

Stop assuming anything, particularly negatives, we simply don't have enough information as Ukraine is keeping a tight lid on all their armed forces plans while Russia has mostly played it's hand.

To your concern about troop numbers, Russia's issues have been logistical, throwing more troops doesn't solve the problem (it actually makes it worse) unless they are entirely devoted to bringing in supplies, which is highly unlikely.

This means the military situation will continue to change but the pendulum of strength is unlikely to change too much.

The way this plays out from here entirely depends on Russian logistics (looks to be in the shit) and Ukrainian strength (unknown, but a lot has been pouring in, will take some time to influence the outcome).

For example, once destroyed, morale is almost impossible to regain. And looking at what’s happening, that morale is not coming back. It’ll just get worse.

Putin can command X troop go to Y town all he wants, but he can’t physically move them there himself. Ultimately, it’s up to the military to carry out his orders - what happens when they finally refuse to do that?

Also, Russia's annual defense budget is normally around $60 billion USD Per year equivalent.    This is for the entire military, including their nuclear program.

These are sophisticated devices that require significant upkeep, that by their very nature degrade over time.   Based on that alone, it is likely only a tiny portion of the claimed arsenal is still functional, and the rest is just kept up in a way to superficially appear in order for the benefit of arms proliferation inspections.

This dovetails neatly with the typical Russian military doctrine of deterrence, in which a small amount of ""cutting edge"" projects are announced and paraded around like the SU-57, T14 Armata, and a number of demo'd smart munitions that ""prove"" military equivalence with the West, but then can't be built in any kind of real numbers because the money to do so isn't there.

I've never been convinced the Russian military was much of a threat beyond sheer numbers, and nuclear weapons. 

Taking the US as a counter-point - their Carrier groups are an extension of the US itself. They are a floating fortress of force projection, allowing the US to operate anywhere, anywhen. 

The Russians, on the other hand, have one barely operational carrier. It chugs past us occasionally through the English channel, apparently fuelled by burning old tires and plastic patio furniture, judging from the plume of black smoke it chucks out.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.
 
**[Dead Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand)** 
 
 >Dead Hand (Russian: Система «Периметр», Systema ""Perimetr"", lit. ""Perimeter"" System, with the GRAU Index 15E601, Cyrillic: 15Э601), also known as Perimeter, is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear weapons-control system (similar in concept to the American AN/DRC-8 Emergency Rocket Communications System) that was used by the Soviet Union. The system remains in use in the post-Soviet Russian Federation.
 
**[Nuclear holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_holocaust)** 
 
 >A nuclear holocaust, nuclear apocalypse or atomic holocaust is a theoretical scenario where the mass detonation of nuclear weapons causes globally widespread destruction and radioactive fallout. Such a scenario envisages large parts of the Earth becoming uninhabitable due to the effects of nuclear warfare, potentially causing the collapse of civilization and, in the worst case, extinction of humanity and/or termination of life on earth.

WW3 is here whether we like it or not. Even if Russia magically backed down, which it wont, European-Russian relations will never be the same. They will be in constant conflict for the following decades.

NATO sending weapons, supplies, and intel is no different than sending people in to fight. This is a distinction that Russia seems to be siding with more and more every passing day. There will come a time when Russia will decide whether or not to go after NATO with it's continued support of Ukraine. NATO will then decide to either continue support in violation of Russia or NATO will back off. If NATO retreats then it is the end of the Alliance. No country will want to join or be in a military alliance if the Alliance is willing to back down from an invader.

Nobody wants war. War is already here because Russia invaded Ukraine. Russia wouldn't have invaded Ukraine if it was scared of NATO. Russian knew that NATO would not send in troops or attack it.

As far as the US in Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual military operations were stunning successes that only took a few days to conclude.   Reforming a culture and a government and taking out an imbedded insurgency is not really a goal that any military is capable of achieving.  In fact I would argue that the US was doomed in Iraq and Afghanistan *because* the US approached those goals as military objectives that could be accomplished with military power.  They never were.

Remember, your credit line isn't issued by Visa or Mastercard. It's issued by a bank, who is part of the Visa/Mastercard processing network. That is what Visa and Mastercard sell. Access. 

And now access to that network stops at the Russian border.

For frame of reference:

In 2019, the two controlled over 70% of purchase-on-site and internet transactions within Russia.

[Visa and Mastercard - 2019 - Russian Marketshare](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1116613/russia-payment-card-usage-for-ecom-and-pos-by-brand/)

And the two disclosed to the SEC this week that Russia accounts for 4% of each company's revenue, per year for both in country and cross-border transactions.

[Visa and Mastercard - Russian Share of Revenue](https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/visa-follows-mastercard-in-disclosing-potential-impact-from-russia-ukraine/619649/)

Last year, Visa reported revenue of $18 billion, and Mastercard reported revenue of $24 billion. If we assume each ""skims"" an average of 2.5% off of each transaction (see [here](https://www.valuepenguin.com/what-credit-card-processing-fees-costs)) and reverse engineer it, Visa and Mastercard are collectively responsible for processing around $67 billion dollars of *credit* transactions a year in Russia. If you add in the transactions on debit cards, I would assume you could double it (but don't know). If so, it's conservatively north of $120 billion.

All that to say... it's highly disruptive to the consumer market in its own right. With the other sanctions, it could be the tipping point that completely destroys the Russian economy.",False,1646526574.0,t3_t7m2bv,t1_hzihnax,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Now that we've dispensed with the hyperbole, let's break it down; what do you think 'war' with Russia looks like.  In the case of a no-fly zone, it will be allied aircraft patrolling the skies over Ukraine and shooting down any Russian assets in the area, and possibly taking out Russian launchers.   This is very low risk to western assets that are a class or two above ANYTHING Russia has to bring to the game.

Do you think Putin will try to invade a NATO country and open a second ground war?  Based on what he's done in Ukraine I think we all know how that would end.  The air supremacy of the west alone would smash his armies to bits.

Do you think Putin would launch nukes?  Okay, let's assume you do, and he is ready to kill himself and Russia in the process.  Well do you have any faith in their nuclear readiness at this stage based on what they have demonstrated.  Do you have completely unwavering confidence his generals won't veto his orders and kill him.  Do you trust the men who have to ACTUALLY push the buttons int he silos and sub will do it.  Do you believe ANY of his bomber would get through to deliver their warheads?

So what EXACTLY is the problem with 'war with Russia' other than the fact it is scary.  And what makes you think it would escalate outside the physical borders of Ukraine.  Russia knows they cannot fight a war with NATO.  Putin is TERRIFIED that NATO might grow a pair and get involved militarily based on what a few of their weapons alone have done to his forces.  

I would argue, if NATO said 'As for Tuesday, we are implementing a no-fly zone over Ukraine' Russia would negotiate and withdraw almost instantly.

No general here but nuking someone to show them your not bluffing, other than the fact its a bad idea and the question has no actual right answer, only works if your opponent doesn't have nukes with which to also show you they are not bluffing.

Rhetoric aside, it's conceivable that a conflict could remain conventional or at least semi conventional without automatically resorting to nuclear exchange. Nukes would likely be last resorts, despite their deterrent and strategic value because there is likely no coming back from it. It's possible could be a small exchange and cooler heads prevailing with the gravity of it, but a full out exchange is a bad scenario for all parties.

So putting on my evil hat, in Russia's situation they have one spot that is ""completely harmless"" which also gets the advantage of being blatantly visible for some. Firstly, they could detonate it in the Black Sea. Nicely offshore, a low yield tactical device with minimal fallout. Secondly, you could do it offshore (in the Sea of Azov) within visual range of Mariupol. The way to be LEAST dickish with doing it is that for all locations in visual range of the blast you spam leaflets and audible messages informing people that at X time on Y date you are going to be detonating a small nuclear weapon offshore and to not look at the flash. This partly lets people know something is happening (so they can get worked up by it) and partly is ""humanitarian"" in that you're attempting to minimize the harm to ensure your demonstration remains purely demonstrative.

In that situation, the bulk of Ukraine gets to react to ""Oh god, nukes ARE in play!"" and if you think that the Ukrainian people are the sort that would balk and abandon Mariupol at this demonstration, you get both effects.

Now, this ignores that even a demonstration blast would fairly instantly change things. For example, China is perfectly happy with the way things are going because they'll probably end up in control of a puppet-Russia by the end of it all. But if Russia starts popping off nukes, the chance that China itself ends up a glowing wasteland suddenly exists. Russia would instantly find itself not only entirely isolated from the world, but might actually face the very real threat of a global first strike of some variety.

Does it make sense for Russia to do a demonstration blast? No. The consequences INSANELY outweigh any hypothetical benefits.

Is it possible that Putin might decide ""Just a small one...off to the side...""? Well...that's why we're discussing what (little) is known about the Russian nuclear launch authorization systems.",False,1646536558.0,t3_t7m2bv,t1_hzj2wzq,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

They were under the joint command of Mstislav the Bold and Mstislav III of Kiev. The battle was fought on May 31, 1223 on the banks of the Kalka River in present-day Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, and ended in a decisive Mongol victory.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

It redefines the outer edge of what could be done as that, and makes any lesser actions seem ""reasonable"", which both puts pressure on Western politicians to take those actions and gives them the political cover to do them with little pushback.

We've now got all the media debating a no-fly zone. Anything proposed by government less serious than a no-fly zone seems sensible and uncontroversial.

A week ago it'd have been unthinkable that we're talking about directly giving Ukraine combat aircraft *during* a hot war with Russia. Now it's the less controversial option to a no-fly zone and will barely be news if it happens.

At war with Russia as a geopolitical and military entity, yes; ""we"" would not be at war with a handful of dudes who happen to own mansions or large boats outside of Russia and more than Russia would then be at war with Elon Musk or Bill Gates. The oligarchs' power over Russian affairs of state remains informal, even if quite real; I'm glad these steps are being taken to address their real influence, but more has to be said about how that informality is being accounted for, because it does actually have to be by people claiming to use the law as their tool in this.

> Sometimes the whole world agrees on something and you just go with it. In this case everyone is on board with putting pressure on the only people that likely have any sway on Putin.

Certainly, and for once the whole world is right to agree on something. I don't care about that, and am delighted that these pigs are finally getting what's so long been coming to them. Nevertheless, when this is being undertaken by people who claim to be doing so for legal reasons, and through drafting legislation to enable it, I don't think it's unreasonable to be curious about how they propose to frame it given that *in that case* they can no longer just say ""because we all want to.""",False,1646534606.0,t3_t7m2bv,t1_hzis6w8,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This is not an academic question, either, given that Congress is literally trying to pass an act to further enable this. There has to be some legal substance to it, though; they can't just have the text of the ""Give Ukraine The Oligarchs' Shit Act"" be ""those guys suck, also see the title of this act.""

In the meantime it is definitely different from property seizure from criminals given that those having their property seized in this case, while morally criminals and probably legally provable criminals eventually, have largely not yet been charged with or convicted of any justifying crime in these jurisdictions. ""We all know you're trash, give yacht"" is not a legal argument, and the world agreeing that they're awful people who exercise unmatched power over Russian affairs of state is not actually a substitute for a trial.

To be crystal clear: it is 100% fine to take the oligarchs' shit and redistribute it to Ukrainians, to the poor, even into a volcano for all I care. Fuck these parasites for now and forever. No law on earth should prevent it, and no law on earth should be necessary to enable it. Their time must end, and now. **All of that being the case**, it is still also the case that the people currently imposing these punitive measures are trying to do so through legal mechanisms and ostensibly in defense of the rule of law.

It's completely justifiable, but that's why I'm asking how the people claiming to justify it through certain tools are doing so. ""Because we really want to and they suck"" isn't a justification *in that context*, even if I don't disagree with it.

Also, while some of them have rightly been sanctioned, no authority has yet charged them with or convicted them of war crimes. The matters now proceeding before the ICC may change that soon, but currently this is not the case. If your argument is rather that they are *morally* war criminals, fine; that's probably true. But they aren't in the one kind of important sense that ""he's a war criminal!"" requires as a pretext for legal action.

> The fabric of Russia is made up of companies these people own in conjunction with said govt. Russia government is much more like criminal organization than actual government.

Of course, but this is not the same as them ""literally"" being the Russian government, which they are not. They don't have to be to be morally culpable and worthy of punishment, but there's no ""literally"" involved in this.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

It's a folktale written by famous Danish author Hans Christian Andersen for his last book in the Fairy Tales Told For Children.  
Two men trick a vain king who spends his states money selfishly on himself into believing they've woven him clothes so special that fools and lesser people wouldn't be able to see the fabric. His officials and himself check on the progress but no one is willing to admit they cannot see the fabric because it would be admitting they were fools.

That is, a neutron hits a nucleus, which splits it and releases more neutrons and lots of energy. If these product neutrons can be contained to a critical level, by consolidating a *critical mass*, then reaction can be self-sustaining (nuclear power) or exponential (""super-critical"") (nuclear meltdown...or detonation). Fission weapons use conventional explosives to compress the fissile material to a super-critical mass in a very short amount of time. Yet, they need to toe the line of criticality. It's all very precise and dangerous. Read about ""Criticality accidents"" for more info.
Now, fissile isotopes, like all radioactive isotopes, decay in time. Pu-239, mentioned in the text, has a half-life of 24,110 yrs. U-235 is on the order of 700 Myrs.

67cdf8ce210b9d14ce318d030fb5e854,t7m2bv,hzizruv,"I think it was a combination of factors:

-There was *some* public outcry when they invaded in 2014 but it really didn't amount to much in terms of actual impact.  Taking that into account and seeing very little true Western intervention, he probably thought that if there even were international repercussions, most governments wouldn't be keen to totally stop doing business with Russia.  Keep in mind:  public opinion isn't really a force that Putin sees as credible.  I bet he honestly thinks that most large power blocs are still going to do whatever they want regardless of what the masses think.

-He (and to be honest, almost everyone else) thought that the Ukrainian military/populace would be a pushover.  On one hand, on paper, every analyst was looking at the situation and thinking ""Kyiv is done in 5 days,"" from a tactical perspective, and *even if* there was popular resistance, Russian disinformation had been railing the Ukrainian population for over 7 years.  Everything Russia did with troll farms, fake news, bots, etc. was perfected in Ukraine to really gin up polarization of the populace.  There is still a portion of the Ukraine that sees itself as ethnically Russian that has been exposed to all the whacky pro-Russian social media stuff you would expect, and have been for years.  I think he was expecting a newly created democracy, whose populace had only been what we consider to be an actual popular democracy for maybe 8 years, who had been polarized for almost a decade, would put up little actual resistance.  You maybe have some protests here or there, but with such a young nation, any real patriotism is probably gonna collapse the moment the bombs start dropping.

-I think he misunderstood the actual military situation in Russia.  Old school KGB guy with aspirations of a Greater Russia, probably saw his military the same way that a Soviet officer would have in the 70's, 80's.  Big, capable, designed to steam roll, filled with patriotic troops who believed in the greater Soviet cause, staffed with veterans from major conflicts.  Instead, I think we are seeing the side effects of a crony style government.  Instead of a well run logistic apparatus, there are signs that a lot of the maintenance really required to have a large military operate well just hasn't been done.  The soldiers themselves don't appear to have much interest in fighting, and the ones that do were probably told to expect light resistance because in such a state you are going to withhold any kind of negative information.  If you prep your invading force with ""Be prepared for heavy resistance,"" then all of a sudden the party line of ""We are liberators"" is going to not make as much sense.  I also wouldn't be surprised if the unchecked corruption has taken it's own toll.  If there is no real independent data getting to your desk, it's really hard to find out if large army units have had CO's selling their ammunition, or skimping on parts to stay under budget for promotions, lying about combat training for ribbons, not undergoing needed maintenance, etc.  There is a laundry list of things that need to be done to allow a modern military to actually steam roll.  The American's pride themselves on being a well oiled supply system with guns.  It requires a lot of work, a lot of verification, and even in a system with at least nominally, independent and open press, still VERY hard to do, with tons of waste.  Imagine that system where no one tells the truth or has incentive to give bad news.

You add that up and I think the picture becomes clear that it was just a series of errors that just all added up and landed the wrong way.

If your question as to the *philosophical* why, the answer that makes the most sense to me is that Putin really did see a Western aligned Ukraine as a strategic threat.  The United States would hardly tolerate it if Mexico formed a strategic defense pact with China.  It would be considered an existential threat. We, and pretty much the entire international community, accept the Monroe doctrine, even though it definitely precludes an entire hemisphere from forming independent treaties with certain independent states.  I think his desire to decrease Western influence on his borders just backfired tremendously.",1646533464.0,1646533253.0,t3_t7m2bv,t1_hzivsa0,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

And Task and Purpose got their story just like any other media source at MWX, secondhand.

For clarity, Adversary Force (bad guys) was comprised of:
- A battalion of US Marines (2/5)
- 100 Royal Marine Commandos (40th RM)
- Unk (likely Co (-)) of MSOB

ExFOR (Good guys):
- 3 x Battalions w/ Reg/MEF lvl support 

Without dragging this ridiculous argument out, here is why FoF can be b/s:
- None of the forces have any simulated HE rounds so they can just “fairy dust” a Jav team having 50x missiles (fake news).
- Painting casualties is extremely unrealistic and often done in the form of “this whole squad is dead”.
- The ADFOR get hyper enabled and again, pretty much unlimited ammo.

In addition to the above source I have also participated in the exercise twice now. Similar things have occurred and it is hardy because a group of “super incredible more-than-human Royale Marines” are able to defeat a Regiment in the open desert with zero logistics.

On top of all the Russian hardware they've reappropriated for their own combat units.

The Southern part of the country is facing its' challenges from the Black Sea Fleet though and that's a whole other issue.  The Navy can resupply the Russians there, and that land bridge was pretty much what Putin wanted from the start.  Combating concentrated Russian artillery has been difficult, and only the Ukrainian Special Forces have been able to make a dent in that specific issue along w/ the drone strikes.  At a certain point I think they'll try to do a breakout to consolidate w/ the Ukrainian forces in the North.  Try and circle the wagons and figure out how to best put their numbers to use.

If they can secure the land bridge I think that Putin will try and use that to save face by offering a complete w/d.

Protesters held two anti-war protest rallies on 2 and 15 March 2014. The latter, known as the March of Peace (Russian: Марш Мира, Marsh Mira), took place in Moscow a day before the Crimean referendum. The protests have been the largest in Russia since the 2011–13 Russian protests by the Russian opposition against the alleged electoral fraud committed by United Russia during the 2011 Russian legislative election.

Another big thing here is that no NATO country is really prepped for a shooting war with Russia.  It takes time to begin offensive operations.  If you want to see what happens when you half ass planning take a look at Russia's latest offensive.   By the time NATO got ready this thing would be over one way or the other.
