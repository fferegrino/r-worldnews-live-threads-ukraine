Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 11 July 2022
 
- As of Sunday 10 July, Russian artillery bombardments continued in the northern Donbas sector, but probably without any major territorial advances. Ukrainian forces continued to apply localised pressure to the Russian defensive line in North East Kherson oblast, also probably without achieving territorial gain.

- In late June, a Russian-language media agency based in Russia's far eastern Lake Baikal region uploaded a video in which the wives of soldiers from the Eastern Military District's (EMD's) 36th Combined Arms Army directly appealed to a local politician for their husbands to be returned home from service in Ukraine. One woman claimed that personnel of EMD's 5th Separate Guards Tank Brigade are 'mentally and physically exhausted, because they have been on active combat duty since the launch of the 'special military operation' on 24 February 2022.

- The lack of scheduled breaks from intense combat conditions is highly likely one of the most damaging of the many personnel issues the Russian MoD is struggling to rectify amongst the deployed force.

>  
>Pro-Kremlin figures have expressed rare public concern after Western-supplied weapons allowed Ukraine to carry out a series of successful attacks on Russian targets far behind the frontlines.  
The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), which the United States started sending to Ukraine last month, appear to have been most effective at damaging Russian military positions.     
Russia has suffered ‚Äúlarge losses in both men and equipment‚Äù in less than a week, according to Igor Girkin, a former commander of separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.    
‚ÄúThe Russian air defense systems‚Ä¶ turned out to be ineffective against massive strikes by HIMARS missiles,‚Äù Girkin, who also goes by the alias Strelkov, wrote on messaging app Telegram on Sunday.  
Alexander Sladkov, a prominent war correspondent for state-run broadcaster Rossia 1, said Monday that Ukraine had successfully attacked Russian command centers.

>The Ukrainian military carried out 14 strikes on Russian ammunition stores and military bases on Russian-occupied territory in the past two weeks, the BBC's Ukrainian service reported Monday. While it is unclear whether HIMARS were used in all cases, BBC Ukrainian said the strikes‚Äô accuracy indicated they were responsible.  
‚ÄúOver the last 5-6 days, more than 10 large dumps for artillery and other ammunition, several oil depots, about 10 command centers and about the same number of troop gathering points were hit,‚Äù ex-rebel commander Girkin said.

Day 138 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It appears that 3:30am is indeed their new scheduled time for missile strikes; they launched their missiles at that exact time for the third day in a row now. Out of an unknown number of missiles (presumably 3), two managed to get through and landed somewhere in the city, both explosions sounded pretty close to us, probably within 3km.

Somehow that missile that hit a residential building yesterday didn‚Äôt kill anyone, even though an entire section of the building, all 6 floors, completely collapsed. Couple people were injured and one granny survived by standing in the bathroom at the time of the missile hitting the building, she was rescued from under the rubble pretty much unscathed. 

Then at 10am Russians fired 4 MLRS salvos at a residential district, killing 6 people and injuring over 30 more. They also damaged many residential buildings and a mall in the process. What did those fuckheads say about it? They said that they ‚Äúkilled 250 nationalists and destroyed 25 vehicles.‚Äù The only vehicle they destroyed was a civilian car that was passing by. It was a direct hit by an Uragan rocket, which disintegrated the car and killed both people inside.

And what about that double tap on a residential building in Chasiv Yar? They killed 33 civilians in that single strike, including at least one child. But Russian MOD said that they killed ‚Äú300 nationalists‚Äù The part of the building that they destroyed can‚Äôt even house 300 civilians, let alone 300 soldiers with all their gear, it‚Äôs a small 4-storey apartment building.",False,1657595935.0,t3_vw9bvg,t3_vw9bvg,,0,72,0,72,1,0,

üëâ This weekend, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.

üëâ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy [has ordered](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1546225685655592960) the Ukrainian army to retake the south/costal areas of the country.  The [times reported](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546183925965504512.html) Ukraine has amassed one million men to fulfill this directive.

üëâ The [Ukrainian Partisans](https://twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1545792939753963523), US HIMARS, and allied MLRS systems are wreaking absolute devastation behind russian lines with important [command posts](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1546234978001833984), [military bases](https://twitter.com/knittingknots/status/1546294731465949189), [ammo dumps](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1545977413754146821.html), and [railway lines](https://twitter.com/NLwartracker/status/1545679577170706432) hit over the weekend.  The damage has become so great that russian bloggers and posters have all but [ceded the war](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546260976441430016.html) to Ukraine with Girkin pointing out that [russian air defense can't hit](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1546159073304920065) the HIMARS rockets, and another blogger saying that russia can't decentralize its ammo because that would mean [decentralizing the russian military](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1546256088324005890) and changing its entire command structure.  One unfortunate post noted that russia was [using children](https://twitter.com/loogunda/status/1546222613827145731) to move an ammo dump when it was hit by a Ukrainian missile.  

üëâ Canada [agreed to send](https://twitter.com/ErikJor55867758/status/1546318835187425280) the gas turbine it repaired for russia to Germany over the weekend.  Germany will likely forward it on to russia.  In all fairness, Canada can not legally deny Germany the turbine because Germany is not under sanctions.  Regardless, the Nord pipeline is being shutdown today for ten days of maintenance and I found a really right stellar thread for you [explaining what it all means](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546174453331230721.html).  And to show you what a bind Germany (and Europe) is in, here's a very, very [deep backgrounder on the European gas crisis](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1545709796413825027.html)

üëâ Ukraine is firing [3,000 ammo rounds](https://twitter.com/Aviation_Intel/status/1545896968752226304) a day of NATO munitions, indicating that the west is doing a good job of keeping them stocked.  This isn't quite the 50,000 rounds russia was managing before all its ammo dumps blew up, but at least the Ukrainian rounds are going where they're aimed.

üëâ  In addition to the $400 million in military donations announced last week, the US announced an additional [$368 million](https://twitter.com/JrmChenu/status/1546086092193107968) in humanitarian assistance. 

üëâ The recent news of the (cough) overweight ""General Pavel"" has been [proven false](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1545651614253555712.html) -- quite a bit of detective work in that thread.  So if you're fighting off the internet trolls, you can't bring General Pavel out as heavy artillery.

üëâ Interesting Bits...

üìå Put a Pin In It: Russia seems to be [amassing troops](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1545679682175107072) near Belarus and Ukraine.  russia is flying [more sorties](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1546105402562973696) from Belarus.  Ukraine has [captured saboteurs](https://twitter.com/DEFENSEEXPRESS/status/1546205858325053442) from Belarus.  And Ukraine is [busy mining the border](https://twitter.com/UA_struggle/status/1546059840581238784).  So this is definitely an area I'm keeping an eye on, though I expect it is all a bluff.

üì° Under the Radar: Last week I reported that Romania and Ukraine are [opening a rail line](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1545231696852910082).  Thanks to the liberation of Snake Island, it means there is now additional [import/export routes](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1545873092848803844) and this [long backgrounder thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1545690584228175874.html) helps explain the good news.

‚úäüåª Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has no clear war objectives and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

The basics: my mom was heartbroken over what she was seeing, as both a grandmother and a nurse.  She actively wanted to help more, and we have a fairly large house which has a couple empty rooms.  Besides that, I have \*a lot\* of close Russian/Ukranian friends and we've been doing Russian duolingo for a few years as a family.  So it seemed like we might be able to help if someone made it out our way (southern california)

The update - my mom did fill out a form on some website, advertising a place to stay.  We honestly hadn't thought or talked about it for months, but... as of a few days ago, we learned that a Ukrainian family from Odessa was in California and needed a place, and that they had been placed with us.  We're expecting Konstiantin, Ana and their 9(ish) year old son later this week (at some point after Thursday).

!

Its been quite a few days as we run around trying to set things up \[I'm living with my parents, both in their late 60s and retired, and we brought it up back in March because we had/have space\].  I think we've thought through just about everything, and our initial communications have been very positive.

None of us have done anything like this before, so obviously we're doing whatever we can do make them comfortable (with at least a little attention on covering our own butts), but its strange... my dad, who has never been one who can easily share his space (and who has gone through some serious health issues in the last 3-4 months) seems downright excited.  I think  we're all assuming it'll either be one of the most rewarding things we ever do, or... well.. not, lol.  Only one way to find out!

Anyone who has insight / things we should think about please share.  The one picture of the family we have shows their son to be - to put it mildly - less than ecstatic about things (obviously completely understandable).  I'm figuring a PS5 controller will go a long way in transcending language and other challenges.  But any tips on how to make his life easier in particular are appreciated.

>First, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to summon Canada's representative to our country due to an absolutely unacceptable exception to the sanctions regime against Russia. It's not just about some Nord Stream turbine that Canada shouldn't have, but still decided to hand over. Hand over actually to Russia. This is about common rules.

>If a terrorist state can squeeze out such an exception to sanctions, what exceptions will it want tomorrow or the day after tomorrow? This question is very dangerous. Moreover, it is dangerous not only for Ukraine, but also for all countries of the democratic world.

>The decision on the exception to sanctions will be perceived in Moscow exclusively as a manifestation of weakness. This is their logic. And now, there can be no doubt that Russia will try not just to limit as much as possible, but to completely shut down the supply of gas to Europe at the most acute moment. This is what we need to prepare for now, this is what is being provoked now.

>Because every concession in such conditions is perceived by the Russian leadership as an incentive for further, stronger pressure.

>Of course, this decision on one turbine, which leads to many other problems, can still be revised. Russia has never played by the rules in the energy sector and it will not play now unless it sees strength.

>Debris clearance continues all day in the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region. The day before yesterday, Russian terrorists hit two high-rise buildings, and as of now 31 people are known to be killed. Nine were saved.

>Kharkiv faced new brutal attacks by the Russian army. Another rocket hit a residential building - one block was completely destroyed. In the morning, the occupiers shelled the Saltivka and Kyiv districts with rocket artillery ‚Äì five people were killed.

>The Odesa region was hit by missiles, extremely violent hostilities continued in the Donetsk region and on the territory of the Luhansk region.

>My condolences to all relatives and friends of the deceased‚Ä¶

>And against such a background, it's just a shame to see people lacking the courage to honestly deal with one turbine.

>Today I submitted to the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine a very important draft law - on legal and social guarantees for Polish citizens residing in Ukraine. In fact, this is a response to the law that was adopted by the Polish state in the spring in the interests of our citizens. In particular, I propose to give our Polish brothers the opportunity to legally stay in Ukraine for 18 months, the right to employment, economic activity, study at our universities, medical care.

>One often mentioned issue of concern is that the former German Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der, four weeks before leaving office, agreed to a financial guarantee of one billion Euros by Deutsche Bank and KfW (the state-owned development bank) to Gazprom, but the Merkel government found no irregularities.25 The EU Commission has launched an investigation on the suspicion that this may constitute illegal state subsidisation. Germany has become Russia‚Äôs most important trading partner. Germany is dependent on Russian energy and Russia is dependent on German goods and investments.26 However, as this interdependence is largely asymmetrical and Russia attempts to advance its own independence, it would be wrong to assume that trade between EU members and Russia will be a security provider.

I actually love this about people / the world. Culture and the norms within one are neat. Even within the same country, norms obviously can vary by region, city, and person.

Under pressure last week, Boris directly contradicted some of the apparent details of this scandal. It seems in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisonings, Boris travelled to Italy to meet the former KGB agent without aides or handlers to meet the now billionaire Russian oligarch who has extensive investments in Russian annexed Crimea since 2014. It's not sure what this was about but Boris was the Foreign Secretary at time.

Furthermore, against the advice of MI5, he made Lebedev's son a fucking Lord. Despite the outwardly expression of bullishness against Russia, Boris himself waited weeks to sanction multiple people connected with Putin's regime (and many themselves Conservative donors) which I imagine gave them enough time to move their money out of London.

He's quite compromised and it says a lot that people genuinely believe Boris is anything other than a chancer trying to use Zelensky's popularity to continuously distract from his constant clusterfuck of scandals.

They are using their ""peacetime"" army of contract soldiers, mercenaries and volunteers. They are lacking the much needed conscripts that generally fill out their BTG's with infantry and grunt work. There was some conscripts sent in the first wave but not so much in the more proper attacks once the war started.

BUT what you might see is them talking about the DPR/LPR forces which are conscripted, equipped terribly and treated like shit. Those have been used heavily without abandon. So maybe they are arguing that they are mainly relying on sepratist conscripts? Which I also think is pretty false as the main Russian forces have played a large role (they were the ones sent out on the Kyiv front).

I do think Russia is ""holding back"" somewhat by not properly declaring war, mobilizing and sending all the conscripts in too but I doubt it's because Russia is cocky and thinks it's not needed but rather that more troops just wouldn't help or they'd strain their economy too much or other similar issues.

It sucks, and before anyone starts I have a long history of not defending Russia in any way.

But this truly not as simple as people think, and sometimes the seemingly ""moral"" thing to do can bite you in the ass.

Germany having gas flowing means weapons are going to flow.

Imagine 2 scenarios:

Russia threatens but never cuts gas and small deals like this occurs. Russia has leverage, but the gas flows, as do weapons.

Germany choose the moral option nuking themselves economically, gets ousted and voted out, or breaks one day and just says they are going to be neutral and stop supplying arms.

One is nearly a sure fire way and higher chance to lead to neutrality, the other has a far higher chance of leading to long term support.

China simply doesn't have the manufacturing capability, the logistics capability, or the financial capability to adequately arm it's \~2.8 million troops.

Here in the US, it's no secret that the US government overpays for what is, basically, the bare minimum required equipment: A single M4 carbine, for example, costs the US Military about $1200 (averaged across all current contracts) for the base weapon itself, and another $2000 for the optics package that would go on top of it. That's around $3000 for a single, very basic (although very reliable) carbine that's had almost 70 years of iterative development. China, in comparison, pays about the same for a weapon that's far worse in every measurable way (the US uses glass-reinforced nylon for it's plastic parts, China uses ABS; we use 6061 aluminum alloy, they use 3003 alloy, etc).

Russia and China, both having far less resources to dedicate than the US, had to pick which set of capabilities they wanted more. Counter-insurgency capabilities were both more attractive and more practical for both countries, since they're both authoritarian regimes with a strong grip on their populations. In hindsight, it's obvious that was a bad play because their primary adversary - the United States - is in a uniquely strong position that they can't meaningfully compete against.

The inability to physically count bodies is, in fact, a valid concern. It makes reliable estimates impossible.

>You specifically used the phrasing ""making up""

You're not even talking to the same person.

>I've given you clear examples of how the counting methodology works.

They are examples of how you believe the UA is attempting to count them, not how they have said it works. And if they're estimating dead by watching people leave target areas and subtracting those numbers from the total number of people they saw at an earlier time, they are not using reliable metrics.

>Clearly, the number has some basis in reality but it has inherent inaccuracy. That's a big difference, because it also shows intent. When you're ""making stuff up"", you've let go any connection to the truth, when you're ""estimating"" you're doing your best to be accurate based on the facts

I think you're reading too much into the other person you responded to. Estimates work on a spectrum of evidence-based, error-rate-adhering mathematical integrity on one end, and the other end is unmitigated wishful thinking. War estimates are invariably somewhere in the middle of this spectrum in all cases, but as the ability to count bodies in person disappears, things are going to lean closer to the other end. There doesn't need to be an intent to defraud people.

With all that said, what you guys haven't talked about yet, but what you need to account for, is the inevitable bias ingredient that all war factions always have when they estimate the enemy's war dead. In every war ever fought, the combatants always tell their people that they have killed more people than they really did. It's a staple of war-time press releases, and it's true here in this war too.

If the UA intelligence assessments are in fact watching survivors of an artillery strike trickle out of a target zone after the bombing, they are already dealing with an imperfect metric for counting dead. And on top of that, within that range of possibilities, they are going to err on the upper range of the imperfect estimate, whenever possible, because they are a war party, and that is what war parties do when they publish estimates of enemy war dead to their people.

At bottom, the point the other commentator is making is simply that we should be taking these war estimates with a big-ass grain of salt. It's not too harsh to make this argument.

Again, not disagreeing with this. But the phrasing ""utterly made up"" clearly suggests something very different. We can all agree that there is inaccuracy, I can even agree that there will be overcounting versus undercounting for morale purposes, but the phrasing here was completely off base. 

There are two concepts here, one is ""inherent inaccuracy"" as you have described, and the other is ""made up"", which is inventing and detached from reality. They are absolutely not the same thing and cannot be used interchangeably, unless you believe the inaccuracy is *so* great that there is no difference, but even then the question of intent remains - which in these circumstances is still very important.

And you need to understand that this is not relevant to the discussion. I'm not judging that person by their intent, but by what they wrote. What they wrote is what is real and is what has impact. What you say online matters, as we have seen from countless disinformation and propaganda campaigns. Accuracy in word and thought on political subjects is not something we can just wave away. 

If people mean A but say B in their haste, then that is on them. I placed a comment to say that what they said was not correct, simple as that. If they come back and say ""In my haste I overstated the situation"", then fine - no problem at all. But in the meantime, what you say is what actually counts.

Well quite frankly, that shows a form of extensive interpretation on your part. To get from ""utterly made up"" to what you are saying, you are applying your own view of the situation *and* assuming that this commenter knows this *and* is acting in good faith.

Those are three steps you add in order to interpret it as a benign comment. A more objective reading does not process that response with all these assumptions, and simply looks at what is written down. Again, this is why accuracy online matters. We cannot know someone's intentions, we cannot know what they *really* mean, we can only read what they are actually saying. It's up to them to express themselves fully and accurately. If they cannot do that, then it's completely fair to point out any ambiguity or inaccurate statements.

I completely agree they could have simply overstated their case. That's why I responded with ""I think that's a bit harsh"", giving  my reasons, allowing them the opportunity to clarify.

I have an axe to grind about intellectually dishonest people like you, who *claim* to ""support democracy"", while supporting the imperialistic invasion of a democracy by the fascist state of russia.

In order for full democracy to be restored to Ukraine, the first step is to erradicate the fascist invaders. Afterwards, Ukraine knows that they will have to keep in the path of improving their democratic institutions and reduce their corruption, if they want full economic support from the West with their recovery (which they *will* need).

TL;DR: Ukraine has a clear path to full democracy, which involves first the complete obliteration of the invading fascist army. What is russia's path to democracy, again?

b81186404dc5b789c2bb4a16b8b58fd2,vw9bvg,ifp7dsw,"I peeped that Martial Law article here are some highlights:

>Martial law was introduced in communist Poland on December 13, 1981, by General Wojciech Jaruzelski to prevent the democratic opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. Thousands of people linked to the Solidarity Movement, including Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, were arbitrarily arrested and detained. Approximately 91 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police force during the pacification of striking Wujek Coal Mine. Curfews, censorship and food rationing were in place.

> On September 7, 1978, in response to public demonstrations protesting the perceived government involvement in the death of the son of Ayatollah Khomeini, Mostafa Khomeini, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi appointed Chief of Army Staff General Gholam Ali Oveisi as the military governor of the capital city of Tehran.[10] On September 8, the government effectively declared martial law on the capital along with several other cities throughout the country, after which further protests erupted that lead to the army opening fire on a group of protesters in Tehran's Jaleh Square on the same day. Estimates on the number of casualties vary; However, according to Iranian human rights activist Emadeddin Baghi, the number of people killed was 88 of which 64 were gunned down in Jaleh Square.

> Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament under the constitution had the civilian power to declare a State of Emergency. When in martial law, the military gained all powers of the state, including to dissolve the parliament and suspend the constitution as it did in its fifth announcement.

> Since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the Turkish Armed Forces conducted three coups d'√©tat and announced martial law.

> Martial law was imposed in Beijing in 1989 following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by the Communist-ruled government on mainland China.

> With an escalation of violence in the late 1820s, Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur declared martial law in November 1828‚Äîeffectively providing legal immunity for killing Aboriginal people.[4] It would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in the history of the British colonies on the Australian continent.

You understand what ""suppression of civil law"" means, or should I draw it in crayons, so you maybe understand?

The point: any type of democracy in Ukraine is *impossible* for as long as the anti-democratic fascist state of russia is occupying it, which has led to the *suspension* (**not** *termination*) of *some* civil laws, through the enaction of ""martial law"", as it is common (even in full democracies). As soon as the invasion is dealt with, Ukraine will resume its path towards being a full democracy (and it cannot stray too far from that path, since it *needs* the economic support of other democracies for its reconstruction). 

But... nevermind... this surely is too complicated for your big tankie brain.
