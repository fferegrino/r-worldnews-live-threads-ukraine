Day 218 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, but a couple times we had air raid alerts that were followed by telegram posts saying that something is being launched from Belgorod, though no missiles made it to Kharkiv. Not long ago, at 3:30am, it happened again, missile launch was sighted, and then instead of going to Kharkiv those missiles blew up over Belgorod. People living there said that missiles fragments were falling in residential districts, Russians really love killing civilians, even if they are their own civilians.

They continue firing missiles at Dnipro, today they aimed their missiles at a public transportation company. They destroyed over a hundred buses with that attack, and for what? With yesterday’s missile strike that was also aimed at Dnipro, they hit a private house with a Kh-22 missile, the same 1 ton warhead missile they used to hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk. They completely erased that house and killed the entire family that was inside, an 8 year old boy, a 12 year old girl along with their mom and grandma. What was the point in doing this? Will killing those children help them not lose Lyman?

They are just pathetic, and tomorrow they intend to officially “annex” 4 of our oblasts. That won’t change anything for us, but because from their point of view it will be “their” territory, they will be able to use conscripts to “protect” it, and not just use conscripts, but also not pay them anything. I’m pretty sure a conscripts pay is something like 30 dollars per month in Russia. So not only will they have to die for nothing, but they will also not be paid for it. And of course expect them to threaten to nuke us yet again, which will never stop us, but they will continue to threaten us anyway.",False,1664500657.0,t3_xqxon6,t3_xqxon6,,0,133,0,133,1,0,

It's important to clear that out to remove a threat, but the town itself isn't that valuable. (The Ukrainians are smartly trying to encircle Lyman and force the Russians to surrender/retreat, rather than spending lives and equipment to force them out.)

The main (near-term) goal for the Ukrainians is the push to the northeast towards Svatove, which is the main logistical hub for the Russians in the western part of the area east of the Oskil river and north of the Severodonetsk river. If Ukraine manages to take/cut off Svatove, the entire Russian position along the Oskil river and in the area of Lyman becomes unsupportable.

The other major Russian logistical hub is further to the east, at Starobilsk. If the Ukrainians can push to that, the entire region (including the Russian positions in and around Severodonetsk) become unsupportable.

And if the Ukrainians can regain control of Severodonetsk and the nearby area along the Severodonetsk river, it gives them the ability to cross south over the river, and threaten the flanks/rear of the Russian's west-facing defensive lines all the way down the Donbas.

That's all a massive undertaking, but that seems to be the goal of this offensive - not just to clear the Russians out of that northeast corner of Ukraine, but to use those gains to threaten the entire Russian-occupied Donbas area.",False,1664467235.0,t3_xqxon6,t3_xqxon6,,0,71,0,71,0,0,

*Over the last few weeks, we have spoken to 15 civil servants, parliamentary deputies, and executives. All of them said the military conflict will only escalate in the coming months. Yet none can predict what will happen if Russia loses.*

According to them, Putin still repeats the mantra about Russia being surrounded by enemies and the machinations of NATO. Talking to him is pointless.

> “By now, everyone is on edge, and it is clear the war will not end soon,” said the source, who regularly attends meetings in the Kremlin.

> “Even now, people try to think that this is all temporary. Things are escalating now, and that's good because it means it will all be over sooner,” said one source at a large private company who rubs shoulders with top officials.

The source, who described his own return from summer vacation as “a return to prison,” said: “People are ready to lead their children, husbands and sons to the slaughter. It’s downright evil… People don’t need therapists anymore; they need psychiatrists.”

The government officials we interviewed — both supporters of the war in Ukraine and those internally opposed to it — found it difficult to state the ultimate goal of the war and its possible outcomes.

- In the seven days since President Putin announced the 'partial mobilisation' there has been a considerable exodus of Russians seeking to evade call-up. Whilst exact numbers are unclear, it likely exceeds the size of the total invasion force Russia fielded in February 2022.

- The better off and well educated are over-represented amongst those attempting to leave Russia. When combined with those reservists who are being mobilised, the domestic economic impact of reduced availability of labour and the acceleration of 'brain drain' is likely to become increasingly significant.

To weaken the economic and political interests of internal opposition. 

To ensure a permanent schism with Europe which necessitates a strong leader to protect the isolated Russia.

To marry Russia to his all-in position: the possibility of a palace coup on the basis of normalised relations with the west is now more distant. Dissent is now less meaningful because Russia's course is intractably fixed.

The Pentagon said on Wednesday it would send an additional $1.1 billion in long-term military aid to Ukraine, including 18 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System launchers, or HIMARS, one of the most vaunted weapons of the seven-month war with Russia.

But unlike the 16 HIMARS the military rushed to Ukraine from its existing stockpiles over the summer, these new weapons will be ordered from the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, and will take “a few years” to deliver, a senior Defense Department official told reporters.

Shifting the source of Ukrainian military supplies from the Pentagon’s own stockpile, which is large but not limitless, to items newly manufactured by the defense industry indicates that the White House and military leaders are transitioning to a sustainable model Kyiv can depend on for an open-ended war with Russia.

Privately, American commanders have also voiced concern that if the United States sends more HIMARS vehicles immediately, the Ukrainians will burn through the rocket ammunition provided by the Pentagon too quickly, potentially jeopardizing American military readiness in coming months.

This is clear cut however, in 2022 Russia invaded and thats the only reason why they can now lay any claim to this land. It's basically the poltics of ""borders are meaningless if we have the power to say so"" and there are many, many nations who have reason to fear that becoming recognized as the status quo.

A comment from the thread, this is translated from Russian, so it will likely have some parts that read funny:

""They plucked it straight from the mouth)))
At the beginning of the ""special operation"" there is nothing to comment on - very often FOR the war, and when they started sending subpoenas, it turned out that couch experts did NOT mean THAT, and no one wants to save anyone anymore, and die for invented reasons and beautiful slogans too ... Apparently, the letters ""Z"" are much easier to wear lying on the couch, and not from the trenches ... And it turns out that in the 21st century you already want peace and the sea, and not die in war ...""

Another comment suggest pranking z wearers with mobilization papers. 

""I really want this prank to be done now. Approach people with the inscriptions Z, ""we can repeat"" and give an envelope with the inscription ""agenda"". At the same time, they say that they should appear at such and such a military enlistment office by 9 am tomorrow. Their reaction is interesting.""

And a guy from the thread apparentiy did something similar in a youtube video, presumably asking russians if they support the war and if they say yes, they are presented with mobilization papers. You can watch it here:
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wbe-tlooPhQ

Top comment in the video, translated from russian:

""Most of the cries and calls to war come from patriots who will never go to this war. 
Mark Twain.""


A few things you can take from this:

1) Fun

2) Opposition to the war on principle and Putin exists in Russia, it seems that specially but not exclusively in the younger generation. Dont be carried into a general antirussian sentiment or be fooled into swallowing the ""Russians are shit people in general"" ""Most Russians support the war"", this is likely what the Kremlin wants to spread and wants you to believe, nationalism at home and russophobia abroad. Make those that oppose the Kremlin feeling internationally isolated, make neutral people think that they are hated out of Russia, so there is no use in escaping as they will be seen bad abroad just for being russian, so they have no choice but to obey.

3) The Russian Police State is not as powerful as they would like you and Russians believe. There are public discussion forums where people oppose the war. People can film and upload videos pranking the situation with relative calm. This isnt without risk of course, but such a thing would be nigh impossible in North Korea, so Putin has not attained that power.

4) Z might be becoming, fast, something you are socially shamed for wearing in Russia, aside from government organized rallies. It will be funny if in the future we see some few pro war russians wearing Dragon Ball Z merchandise to justify that big Z in their cars and shirts.",1664507976.0,1664507253.0,t3_xqxon6,t3_xqxon6,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

If he does strike, there's no chance the Russian military could stop the barrage of missiles that will obliterate many of their important positions in and around Ukraine. Bringing in the West into direct conflict is not a battle he can win and only harden the resolve to oppose him.

If Russia tries to deploy a tactical nuke via Kalbr missile from a sub or something, and it gets shot down, there's a possibility Ukraine could retrieve an intact warhead, which would make them a nuclear power overnight - which is a nightmare scenario for Russia. 

I think part of the hesitance for the US to send things like ATACMS is less due to 'fear of escalation', and more due to a doctrine of export control - there's a chance that if you send the really good high-tech stuff, it could be intercepted/captured and fall into enemy hands to be reverse engineered, such as the US drone that Iran brought down and analyzed. Russia would *love* to capture an intact ATACMS installation, I'm sure, and it's always a possibility. Even if it can't be reverse engineered overnight, ways could be found to jam its guidance, etc. So one must be hesitant to send out your top-shelf stuff, because there's a chance it could get 'obsoleted' pretty quickly. 

One thing I have wondered about was whether the Moskva was carrying any nukes. Russia got a deep-diving team out there pretty quickly to recover stuff, and I've wondered if removing warheads was part of that effort:

ICBMs aren't what you use to deliver 'tactical' nukes... it'd almost certainly be a surface, ship or aircraft launched missile, and with Ukraine's increased propensity to down those (nevermind the random failures Russia has had firing its missiles from Belgorod, etc). Imagine being a Russian sub commander who orders such a launch... and then there's no impact on the other end. You don't know if it was a failure, or if the Ukrainians shot it down, etc. So you have to report back that you fired it, and nothing happened... now it's a huge question mark for Russia - does Ukraine have a goddamned intact nuclear warhead?

We all know that Putler has friendly ties with Orban and Erdogan.

By Destroying the NS, the only way to pump gas into Europe would be through:Yamal (Through Belarus)Soyuz (Through Ukraine/Slovakia)Brotherhood(Through Ukraine/Slovakia)SouthStream(Through Turkey)

Lets assume that both Soyuz and Brotherhood are unstable due to war(Actually I recall something about Gazprom and Naftogaz not agreeing.. will look it up).EDIT: Found it.. Soyuz and Brotherhood will most likely no longer be available: [https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-gazprom-rejects-ukraines-naftogaz-claims-arbitration-2022-09-27/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russias-gazprom-rejects-ukraines-naftogaz-claims-arbitration-2022-09-27/)

Nobody believes Putin will use nukes. ""It will destroy his country"".

People need to realize, Putin doesn't give a fuck about Russia. He thought he could have *legacy* but it was denied, so now the primary concern is staying in power. Politically, he cannot afford to lose to Ukraine in a conventional war.

However, if the story is that NATO false-flagged a nuclear attack as an excuse to get involved when the UA army was ""about to crumble"", then it will not be seen as a Russian defeat. It will be a betrayal. A cowardly sneak attack from their nemesis who showed their true faces by ""killing all those innocent people"". Blaming Putin for it will be like blaming him for the apartment bombings. Unpatriotic. An act of treason. In the Russian mind, now will be the time to stand together. To endure! With their leader (the most important part).

This is not fear-mongering meant to feed the narrative of submission. If we give in to the aggressive use of nuclear threats or actual attacks, then we will normalize nukes as a weapon of aggression. Everyone will rush for the bomb and any ""strong man"" leader will seek to abuse their newfound power. Some will even test it against other countries with the bomb who they think weak or those with alliances. The result is predictable. It is far better to accept an increased risk temporarily than a certain apocalypse a few years from now.

So we should deny Russia their threats as a weapon, but we should not be naive. Preparations needs to be made, just as preparations needed to be made in the event of an invasion and the mobilization.

**Unknown drones fly over Danish oil and gas fields**  
On Wednesday, unknown drones were observed over the Danish oil and gas field Halfdan B in the North Sea. The energy company TotalEnergies, operator of the Halfdan B field, informs Ekstra Bladet.  
\- We can confirm that there have been observations of unauthorized drone activity at the Halfdan B oil and gas field in the North Sea on September 28, TotalEnergies' press department informs Ekstra Bladet.  
\- We have taken the necessary steps in accordance with our safety procedures and are in close dialogue with the authorities, TotalEnergies informs the newspaper.  
The Halfdan B oil and gas field is located 210 kilometers west of Esbjerg.  
Earlier this week, the Norwegian authorities warned that mysterious drones had recently swarmed around several Norwegian gas and oil fields in the North Sea.  
The Danish authorities have raised the emergency level for the electricity and gas sector in Denmark to orange, which is the second highest level. This means, among other things, more monitoring of the Danish supply network.

When Russia lost Kupyansk, it lost capacity to directly supply its western front direct by train from Russia.  There is still some overland capacity to link up e.g. at Svatove, but Kupyansk/Lyman was critical to Russia. 

Similarly, Lyman is also a junction from Kharkiv, and recapture by Ukraine would allow it to resupply its ""bridgehead"" directly by rail.  So Russia's ""last stand"" at Lyman is an attempt to deny Ukraine these capabilities.   

Once Russia loses Lyman, Ukraine will be able to bring tons of heavy equipment and supplies directly to bear in combat, at high velocity. 

However, the real victory is that Russia is defending Lyman.  When it falls it will be an unmistakable defeat of Russia by Ukraine.  Not a ""goodwill gesture"", or a ""change of strategy"".  It won't be a situation where Russia was tricked (as the Kharkiv collapse was characterized), but a straight up defeat of Russia, from dug-in positions, in purposeful combat. 

And that will be a psychic shock to Russia, who will not be able to avoid knowing that theirs is the lesser capable army.

So while Russia is suffering reverses on the battlefield, absorbing what they hold, even through sham elections, sends a message to Russians that the operation is working and Russia is achieving its strategic objectives.

This in itself will be used to tell Russian that Ukraine is indeed invading Russia. Which as of now is impossible to say because it's Russia that is invading. For all of us with two brain cells it's obvious that it doesn't change anything.

Ukraine's disadvantages: limited troop numbers. Limited arms and ammo. Russian retreats allowed for troop consolidation, forcing them to fight greater numbers.
Problem for Putin is, russian logistics run on trains. The same trains that that arent compatible with Western rail, forcing russia to offload and reload supplies (creating fat, juicy soft targets) or to offload and immediately disperse supply to prevent severe loss. That speed creates confusion, plus loss of supply vehicles, and misreported losses, false intel, etc, mistakes get made, then compounded because the russian military structure doesn't allow deviation from following all orders, even obviously out of date or incorrect ones.

1. Putin has been surprisingly less threatening about nukes in the past than this month
2. Putin tends to end up doing what he talks about
3. Putin is backed in a corner with few options remaining
   1. Russia's army has been pushed back by Ukraine pretty heavily
   2. The army can't win in Ukraine against NATO goodwill weapons
   3. Failure is weakness and will assuredly result in his removal/death
   4. Mobilization was one of his last bullets and isn't likely to work and is similarly pretty high risk to his regime
4. Putin has shown a willingness to do terrorist acts
5. Russia's army wastes valuable weapons against civilian targets

The best mitigating factors the West has

1. China is level-headed and is extremely unlikely to want nuclear bombs dropped anywhere

Russia's command structure seems fucked anyway - it's mostly flat. You have generals and everyone else (I'm exaggerating a bit, but yeah). Take out the generals and basically nobody is left to command - there's no autonomy in units, you have orders from generals and that's it. If you take out the leadership, it's almost like the end of The Avengers or something, where you kill the controlling bad guy and the others fall apart. That's why so many high profile Russian generals have been killed, because they have to be on the front lines giving direct orders. Subordinates aren't given any latitude to carry out missions on their own, so they become disorganized when leadership is killed off. 

And that was the status quo of the Russian military, now it's even worse - it's becoming apparent that maybe NOBODY is commanding these people thrown at the front lines. They're just bussing them in and putting a rifle in their hand and dropping them off. It's nuts, and it only makes sense if you realize the entire Russian command structure is fucked. This says to me that battlefield commanders are basically wiped out and gone, and only the upper echelon remain, so they're ordering people to the battlefield, but there are no commanders out there to actually tell the 'soldiers' what to do when they get there. So they just show up, bussed to the front, with a rifle in hand and no experience, no communications equipment, no rations or supplies, with the vague command to 'go out there and get those Ukrainians'. 

It's so fucking dysfunctional and so many of them will die as a result if they don't have the good sense to just lie down and surrender. I hope many of them do, and at some point after this is over realize they were treated as cannon fodder by their own country, and come to appreciate the decency of Ukrainians in this conflict when they are taken as POWs and treated better than their own country treated them. The direct experience of returned POWs is the kind of thing that might actually help break the constant propaganda Russians are subjected to.",1664502080.0,1664501502.0,t3_xqxon6,t1_iqfx5kv,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

It's not about the amount of tubey trucks, it's about the amount of missiles they can reasonably be expected to supply in order to continue shooting their tubey trucks for a longer period of time. 

From wikipedia: 
>As of 1 December 2021 50,000 GMLRS rockets have been produced,[60] with yearly production now exceeding 9,000 rockets. Each rocket pod contains 6 identical rockets. 

Let's say they ramp(ed) up production and are now producing double that, that'd give us about 68000 GMLRS in existence on planet earth this year. 500 vehicles, 6 missiles per salvo, so that's ~3000 missiles per fleet-salvo, that'll allow every truck to fire ~22 salvos and they're all gone. 

Let's say a salvo per day, and you're out of ammunition within ~3 weeks.

**Favorite paragraph**

>Having arrived at Novgorod, the hero recalls that in the old days the city was ruled by the people, and questions Putin’s right to appoint his own viceroys to Novgorod. “But what avails right, when might prevails?” – he asks. Taking a break from his reflections, the hero goes to dine at his pal Karp’s, formerly a racketeer working the market, now a local lawmaker. They launch into a conversation on trade matters, and the traveler realizes that the recently instituted anti-trust laws do not ensure honesty, but on the contrary, facilitate easy money-making and theft.

Because of international law, the owner of Crimea (Ukraine) has the rights to those off shore oil deposits.

So they signed a deal with Shell and Exxon to help finance the extraction process and bring in their own technological equipment to get to work.  Two years later Russia invaded Crimea.

Russia has a history of using violence against 'friendly' countries who try to leave it's orbit.

Putin's Russia lives in the Great Power games of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It sees countries as being aligned and pawns for the bigger powers. The rest of the world moved on in the 20th century towards self-determination.

Putin has been wanting Ukraine either a de facto Russian puppet, or as a part of Russia for decades. He was modernising his military to be able to enforce such aspirations on non-aligned former SSRs from well before the discovery of resources (around 2011-14, modernisation started in 2009).

The other fact is that Ukraine wasn't going to magically replace Russia and Russia has other export options it could invest in and gas use is increasing as it's seen by many countries as a 'plug the gap' of coal use, or between renewables and electricity demand spikes.

Basically the resource factor isn't a make/break decision point. The rapid attempt on Kyiv gives away the whole thing, they wanted a Russian-aligned or puppet Ukraine and an annexed East and Crimea.

And if Russia really wanted just the resources, it could have easily salami-tactics the areas it wanted (slice by slice), much easier to do without international backlash.

The *threat* that Russia will use is high. Russia has been nuclear saber rattling  since day 1.  So indeed the threat is high. 

The *risk*, however, isn’t at this point. This is Ukraine doing some PR to push the narrative toward giving more advanced weapons and deterrent systems. 

Ukraine has been doing this throughout the entire war and it’s been pretty useful for them. They pick up on the current “trend” and amplify it. It’s the same they did with Germany and Israel supplying stuff. The same they did with short range to long range munitions, etc. 

(And to be clear, this isn’t saying Ukraine is right or wrong in doing this. It’s working for them, so keep it up)

 The large issue though is that before its even really feasible to roll out there's a large effort needed to (1) train crew needed on an all new system, (2) train enough mechanics on how they work/operate to make fielding them viable, and (3) figure out how the parts required for repairs/the tons of ammo needed are going to be supplied.

  
 all of this is why we haven't seen any western versions of this type of vehicle sent over. but once winter comes and the fronts slow down, I can very easily see how NATO might be able to train crews and ship a decent amount of tanks to possibly offset the difference in experience before spring.

&#x200B;

The most common weapon design for technically sophisticated countries is a miniaturized version of the Fatman using multiple point compression with a small tank of tritium that injects a small amount of the gas into the pit as it is being compressed by the explosives.  This generates an amount of fusion reactions which release neutrons increasing the yield of the weapon by increasing the amount of neutrons available to be captured for fission reactions.  Tritium however decays into Helium after 12 years.  Helium is a fusion poison because its Coulomb barrier force is basically double than Tritium.  This means it captures neutrons and will not undergo fusion unless you increase the pressure and temperature a LOT.

27c87ca3aa3cca4ff28a574443c700e2,xqxon6,iqd6zs5,"No idea if this is bullshit or not, but seems like a reasonable answer to your question:

&#x200B;

*The service life, as it is called, of a weapon is a major concern and billions of dollars are spent annually by the U.S. to ensure that nuclear weapons do not deteriorate and remain functional.*  
  
*If a weapon depends on tritium in any way to function normally, it will cease to do so on the time scale of no more than a couple of decades due the decay of tritium with a half-life of 12.3 years. Neutron generators used to trigger the initial fission explosion are an item that uses tritium; and if the weapon uses gas boosting (as do all U.S. weapons) then that is required for full yield. Tritium is costly so they do not load a large excess into the weapon, but instead change out the components regularly. If gas boosting fails the yield of the weapon, regardless of design yield, will drop to 300 tons; if the neutron generator fails the nuclear yield would be quite small, if any (some fission would still occur initiated by the spontaneous fission neutrons present, but in a modern weapon there are not enough elapsed generation periods available to allow them to multiply to a significant yield).*  
  
*With U.S. servicing practices if tritium is not replenished the weapon will cease to function in less than 10 years time. The U.S. has recently decided to increase its tritium production and maintain a larger inventory to extend the time between servicing required,*  
  
*One limitation with simply increasing the tritium reservoir in each weapon is that tritium decays into helium-3, a potent neutron absorber. Unless the weapon pit is designed with sufficient excess reactivity this may cause the fission reaction to fail.*  
  
*Other components deteriorate on a longer time scale.*  
  
*Plutonium is a very complex active and reactive material. It decays by alpha emission to uranium, disrupting the metal crystal lattice and inserting helium atoms in it; it spontaneously fissions which is so energetic that dramatic local disruption occurs; it reacts vigorously with most any contaminant it encounters, air leakage into the weapon, gases or liquids emitted by other deteriorating components. Plutonium pits in U.S. weapons are projected to be reliable for 90 years, but may deteriorate over the course of centuries, or quite quickly if weapon seals are breached and the pit itself is not encapsulated in a gas-tight shell (most or all U.S. weapons do have such a shell)..*  
  
*Explosives are subjected to neutron irradiation and may undergo chemical deterioration from the chemically active species produced, perhaps eventually autocatalytic deterioration that would quickly ruin the charge once initiated. This is quite unlikely though - high explosives have been tested at radiation levels exceeding one million rads without significant effect.*  
  
*And of course there are batteries required to operate the warhead. Nuclear weapons do use a type of essentially unlimited life battery called a thermal battery. This is a battery that uses solid reactants and/or electrolytes and are chemically and electrically inert at normal temperatures and so is safe from deterioration. Some type of heater (usually pyrotechnic) must heat the battery to start its operation and that in turn requires some sort of always active starter battery though it could be external to the warhead (strictly speaking the pyrotechnic heater could in principle be initiated mechanically - but it is unlikely they do this).*  
  
*It is of course possible to engineer a warhead for long storage life, but during the arms race this was never a consideration. Now that warhead manufacture and testing has ended in the U.S. the military, and the civilians maintaining the arsenal, are regretting that fact.*  
  
*A long life optimized design would eliminate tritium, using deuterium-only neutron generators, eliminate gas boosting (or use the less effective deuterium only boosting), use HEU instead of plutonium, explosives chose for stability, and component packaging and arrangement to provide secure seals and avoid complex interactions. The benefits of tritium gas boosting are so great that this would probably be retained in any redesigned long-life weapon, simply accepting the servicing and tritium production requirements.*",False,1664459096.0,t3_xqxon6,t1_iqd6n5s,,2,16,0,16,0,0,

The big problem Russia has is that there aren't a lot of good natural barriers or defensive topography beyond Lyman in the Lugansk oblast that they can use to block Ukraine.

Aside from that it contains a lot of Russias forces and material in that area. So if they are captured and/or destroyed it would be a significant blow to Russias military strength in the area and as a whole.

In short if Lyman falls, it'd be rather bad news for the rest of the region for Russia. And can get worse depending on how many are stuck there.

2) Because of (1), it's very unlikely any Russian in the chain of command would actually accept an order to fire nukes as anything other than a retaliatory strike. It's also unlikely Putin would survive issuing such an order. The other oligarchs and everyone around him would make sure of that.

3) missile defense systems are vastly superior today to what they were 40 years ago during the cold war. Russian missiles, however, are the same.

4) Russian nuclear missiles are estimated to have a very high failure rate. Don't get me wrong - even if only 1% of their more than 2000 nukes worked, the rest of the world would have a very bad day, but this high failure rate means Russia is unlikely to attempt any sort of nuclear strike that isn't an attempted world-ending strike. Basically, if Russia tries to fire a nuke at Ukraine and it doesn't work, the entire world will still respond as if Russia fired it, but Russia won't get the nuclear strike they wanted. It would be the worst possible outcome for Russia short of point (1).

This threat is a threat, right? This threat I heard it again today! This threat, this threat, did you hear about this threat? Threat... Threat... Threat.

The repetition is the propaganda. I hope you can understand this, that you are being manipulated by propaganda. If the threat wasn't scary, it wouldn't be much of a threat, would it? So of *course* it's concerning, which is why the attack works. Ultimately, though, I doubt very much there is anything you can do to change the situation in any way. The realization of this helplessness is also part of the attack, to wear you down about thinking about the war in general, because it's exhausting. 

I find solace in realizing that these are words directed at me as an attack. It's propaganda, it's manipulative, and most of all it's insincere. The way you deal with liars who are saying things designed to hurt you is to understand this and why they would lie. Then you can ignore the lie because you know.

They lie because they are losing and want to win, and they don't care about you. Listen instead to the various western defense departments when they say there is no change to Russia's nuclear forces. They aren't even readying their kit. Listen to the people who describe the consequences to Russia should they do something with a nuclear bomb. The short version is nothing good for Russia, and one of various versions of destruction. So these are good reasons to continue to support Ukraine and ignore the Russia threats.

The mobilization, the nuclear threats, the annexation of territories, the targeting of Ukrainian critical infrastructure, threatening sanctions on Ukrainian gas pipelines and now the sabotaging of the Nordstream pipelines all fit into a strategy of escalating outside of the conventional battlefield. The goal is to demotivate Ukrainian and European audiences by instilling fear, undermine European governments through energy warfare and domestic unrest while simultaneously buying time by throwing bodies at the front.

The goal is to, yet again, ""outlast"" Europe, from the idea that European audiences fear further escalation, fear high energy prices and essentially ""do not have the stomach"" for suffering such as the Russian people do. We see this reflected most recently in the rhetoric employed by Medvedev as well regarding nuclear escalation, where he essentially states that NATO will not go above a certain limit of escalation because they won't consider Ukraine worth that type of risk.

Essentially, it's continuing on the previous strategy, but now using harsher measures to ""up the cost"" for further EU/US support to Ukraine. The question remains whether this will work, of course. But it's not as if Russia has a lot of other options, at this stage.

Cirincione said he ""fundamentally"" disagrees with Quincy experts who ""completely ignore the dangers and the horrors of Russia’s invasion and occupation and focus almost exclusively on criticism of the United States, NATO, and Ukraine"". Eaton said he resigned because he ""supports [NATO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO)"".

>In theory, tanks and infantry companies in a BTG screen the artillery from counterattacks and mop up the survivors after the bombardment.

Not only did the Russians completely ignore this tactic in the first phase of the invasion and just rushed in head on. When they actually tried it in the East after the disastrous defeat in Northern Ukraine, it turned out that it didn't really work ether. And that should surprise no one, because the tactic of massiv artillery barrages, to completely break the resistance of a fortified enemy and then walk in mostly unopposed, was tried already in WW1 and never worked out.

Turns out, simple things like trenches are a very good counter to conventional mass artillery warfare. Exactly the kind of strategy that Ukrainian troops in Eastern Ukraine already executed and mastered for years.

I disagree. I also think people misuse the word ""rational"" to mean ""good"" and ""irrational"" to mean ""bad,"" and that's not the case. I think Russia had expectations for how this conflict would unfold, which they've been planning for 8 years since Crimea. They made assumptions that this would look like Crimea on a larger scale. They roll in with overwhelming numbers, Ukrainian defense collapses or is nonexistent, they roll into Kyiv and install a new government before the West even knows what happened. They'd get a few sanctions, like with Crimea, but the West would quickly forget and move on.

Just because those assumptions were incredibly wrong doesn't mean that the decision they made was irrational. It means they have awful intelligence and a trash army. And, for the record, just because something is a rational decision doesn't mean it wasn't also morally unacceptable like this invasion. It was a horrific decision and one that we should all support Ukraine to fight against. In fact, many of the justifications for the Russian invasion are similar to the the US justifications for Iraq.

If you're a state like Germany with the ability to issue massive debt and guarantee it with the productivity of 80m people, you do it the other way around. You issue debt while everything is great and interest is near zero, and spend that money to invest it into your country (e.g. infrastructure, education, military). After a few years, the investments start generating positive return, and you increase your edge. If things turn to shit your earlier investments prepared you for the crisis, and you don't need to issue debt that is now expensive because interest is up, so during the crisis you save and wait for better times and lower interest again.

The issue is that Germany was ran by conservatives for 16 years. Conservatives, that during a historically unique period of basically free debt, even negative interest at times, did the most moronic thing they could do. They didn't take advantage of negative interest loans (free money!) and use them to, e.g. massively subsidize heat pumps, create EV incentives, subsidize renewables to reduce gas usage, build out the grid to support massive North/Baltic sea electricity generation for Germany's south, build out cargo & passenger rail, etc.

No, they curbed investments massively during a period where they essentially had access to negative interest loans, they built NS2 to increase Russian dependence, they sold off the world leading German solar industry to China, hamstrung wind expansion by bowing to NIMBYs, they even wrote into Germany's [constitution (!) a mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_brake_(Germany\)) making it extremely hard to issue additional debt. 

Conservatives/Liberals think states should be ran just as shortsighted and maximise-only-next-quarter's-revenue like businesses, and so during crises, their states fail like businesses because necessary investments and reforms aren't made in advance while they're cheap.

 [Life in France, 1920–1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky#Life_in_France,_1920–1939) 
 
 >In June 1920, Stravinsky and his family left Switzerland for France, first settling in Carantec, Brittany for the summer while they sought a permanent home in Paris. They soon heard from couturière Coco Chanel, who invited the family to live in her Paris mansion until they had found their own residence. The Stravinskys accepted and arrived in September. Chanel helped secure a guarantee for a revival production of The Rite of Spring by the Ballets Russes from December 1920 with an anonymous gift to Diaghilev that was claimed to be worth 300,000 francs.
 
**[Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Chanel_&_Igor_Stravinsky)** 
 
 >Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky is a 2009 French romantic drama film directed by Jan Kounen. It was chosen as the Closing Film of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and was shown on 24 May 2009. Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky is based on the 2002 fictional novel Coco and Igor by Chris Greenhalgh and traces a rumoured affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky in Paris in 1920, the year that Chanel No. 5 was created.

The key point of Katz, is that entirety of post USSR must be subjected and given to Rusky mir cultural dominance, by accepting that Russian language is the key that is uniting us all. We MUST give preferance to Russian language, we MUST accept and embrace Russian culture, we MUST settle, because we have common history, and in order for our countries to have peace - we, Ukrainians, MUST allow Russian world (in ideal Katz) view fester and spread in Ukraine and all other post soviet republic. 

You say about McDonald's, Marvel, Coke but I can access all of those in Ukrainian language, and they are happy to provide and serve in my country using our language. 
But with Russian language its different. Spread of Russian language is soft influence of Russians. It was a tool that was used against us in the past. With the fall of USSR Russian language de-facto became main one in ex USSR republic.  
Do you know what has happened since the independence of Ukraine? Russia has done everything to destroy the economy of publishing houses, the press, practically, ideologically suppressing the Ukrainian language, making its use unprofitable. Why is Ukrainian needed when all books are translated into Russian, reports and speakers are in Moscow, all technical things are solved in English and translated into Russian, why do you need your own language? There is a great Russian language, but why is yours needed? Sing songs and dance hopak?

You use Russian or you won't have an audience. You use Russians or they won't understand you. You are using Russian because your ""funny"" language is not needed.

And this devaluation was done with the very clear goal of tying and pulling in 40+ million people in their Russian-speaking field of communication. All forums are in English or Russian. All bloggers are youtubers, comedians, all artists are in Russian. All books, publishing houses, conferences in Russian. Russian is the main language of the post-Soviet space.

All the main culture is in Moscow, which means that everything is decided by Russia.

And then it is already possible through this language, through this audience, through the media, films, books, to begin to put pressure on and impose the Russian agenda. They began to press and put messages important to them, important Russian ideologies. About the Little Russians, about the ""younger brothers"", about the ""one people"".

If we compare the moment of the conditional 2004 (and even 2008) of the Ukrainian media space and Russian. Compare how books were printed in Russia and Ukraine. Having everything purely from an economic point of view, it was extremely profitable to keep to yourself in Russian. Why is Ukrainian necessary? Everything is in Russian anyway. All the stars of Ukraine went to Moscow to earn money. Content in Ukrainian is not needed. This is the language for songs and hopak.
There is nothing wrong with the language, but the Russians used the language and their influence to get into the heads of so many people and play them off.
But I'm not against the language - but I'm against the influence that Russia brings along with it. They made language a weapon. The weapons with which they destroy the Ukrainian identity.

It was initially designed by Ryan Aeronautical (now part of Northrop Grumman), and known as Tier II+ during development. The RQ-4 provides a broad overview and systematic surveillance using high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) of terrain per day, an area the size of South Korea or Iceland.

The lionisation of our countries for our staunch opposition of Russia, and the soundbytes our government provides on the matter do a lot to rehabilitate our region's reputation as a '2nd world shithole, Russia-lite' that it was for decades before, especially with regards to Ukraine who even after 2014 did not provoke enough interest from the West for the vast majority of its citizens to be able to tell an Ukrainian and a Russian, or their languages apart; the problems with racism and homophobia that the representatives of those groups faced here are still absolutely present, with less attention paid to addressing them because we're currently too busy spectating the real life and online clipping of Russia like it's a fucking grotesque reality show that we're addicted to watching and speculating about like we're experts.

None of this societal mess disappears in Ukraine just because Russia invaded. A racist is a racist, even if they're under fire by a hostile, invading force. Nothing to do with 'nazis'. The problem addressed in the tweet concerns the racism of Russians. Does not negate what happened at the Ukrainian Western borders as people fled. One can worry about many issues at once, especially if the issue involves denying privileges pertaining to preservation of life to the non-hostile civilians in your country based on their race and/or nationality.

Like, are you even from Eastern Europe? Have you even lived here for an extended amount of time? Any nation here? 'Cause if you had, then you would have not been surprised *one bit* that this happened at the Ukrainian border, and is happening in Russia. In fact, you would've expected it.

Why do I feel like I've seen your username posting other comments complaining about the 'race card' before. Or was it something about how Geneva conventions should be ignored re: Russian POWs and they should be raped and tortured to death upon capture and imprisonment, by Ukrainian prisoners as a warning and a deterrent to other invaders. Yeah, that one was it, I think, because it's been one of the select few comments that have been so fucked up that I took care to check the username and remember it.

American, am I right? You tend to be reliably the most bloodthirsty in these threads, there's a special way Americans tend to express their outrage and their very loud opinions on what should be done, while displaying societal conservatism and staunch belief in retaliatory crimes against humanity, such as rape or torture. Also opinion on walking back on international treaties set up in no small part to *prevent a global precedent* that would serve as the first domino chip resulting in other countries taking note how the most powerful, wealthy countries in the world walk back on the Geneva convention and other treaties set in place to keep the body stable while a part of it bleeds, *even though they are not at war themselves.*Whilst confidently talking over everybody, including Ukrainians themselves, because y'all are so sheltered by your country's geographical safety, isolation, and its status as a world hegemon that you can't comprehend that the world's more complex and more complicated than you think. It's like an 'only child' syndrome but on a geopolitical scale. Jesus Christ.

Edit: now I can't get my mind off of that comment of yours that I mentioned. If you think that retaliatory rape and torture and pain deter Russians from committing those acts (and they don't and you fucking know it, which honestly makes you someone who gets off on pain and vengeance that aren't yours to inflict) then you don't know dick about what it's been like here in previous wars of invasion, including that of my country. Retaliatory torture is only met with escalation of torture committed by invaders. Always. And our history, the history of all of our countries of the former Soviet republics, is a bloody, miserable fucking example of that. Our peoples know being invaded, defending our soil and people from foreign boots on them far, far, *far* better than any American since the conclusion of your Civil War (and no, Pearl Harbour absolutely doesn't count. Our countries, our cities are all Pearl Harbours but times umpth) So don't ever say shit like that again, or the shit you're trying in this little comment of yours here.

The first and most glaring point you're failing to grasp is while we don't PRODUCE a lot of raw steel/aluminum anymore, we definitely recycle the shit out of it because it cost effective to do so locally. Ever heard of SIMS metal? or literally any of the hundreds of scrap metal wholesalers that buy metal by the tonnage and smelt it down and remake new things?   
Countries like china PRODUCE vast quantities of metal because A) They're in a state of rapid expansion and recycling doesn't meet their needs and B) local laws are shit so environmental and cost concerns are much minor.  
Australia has massive environmental taxes and we actually pay people livable wages so producing brand new material WILL be low, that's just basic economics. We still produce very high quality metals that meet standards most chinese shit will never hope to achieve, and the chinese metals that DO achieve those standards, aren't usually that much more cheaper than just buying them locally because Australia has trains EVERYWHERE which means freight can be far cheaper.

To actually back my words up, the companies BlueScope Steel and Liberty OneSteel are the BIGGEST two producers in Australia, theyre just the biggest, not the only ones. You can google these companies and check for yourself.

Using the car industry as an example is complete trash.  Ford Territories are mass produced locally as are Ford Falcons, in-fact a lot of Fords models are produced locally. Ford is a HUGE company. Saying our car industry is dead because Holden folded is complete hyperbole.

Even in sweden heat pumps are mostly used to provide base heat and swedes understand that you need additonal heat sources.

Natural gas efficency sits at its 90-98%, whereas (air) heat pumps Fall from their 3-400% down to (theoretically) 0%. It is just plain physics. 

And don't get me wrong: if you are building a New, well insulated, home and not use a heat pump you are an idiot. But in okd houses heat pumps can only be an additional heat source to reduce gas usage.

PS: for the climate: if a climate gets more continental it sees greater temperature swings, sweden is colder than central europe but when it comes to the coldest two,three weeks there isn't that much difference between the southern parts of sweden and europe.

Tl;dr: (air) heat pumps truly shine in areas with mild winters, eg Ireland.

He used to sneak food he and a few soldiers overcooked and didn't eat for them, so they gave him gifts.

There, the insurgency really started against us because our state police decided to shoot to kill workers on strike for better rights (this was way before my dad was sent there), and get this, our government then blamed the local opposition party!

Yea, he had communist leanings, but he and Viet Minh was trained by the OSS when the Vichy French, and by extension, the Japanese, were occupying Vietnam.

NATO membership is potentially open to all of Europe's emerging democracies that share the alliance's values and are ready to meet the obligations of membership.

There is no checklist for membership.

We have made clear that, at a minimum, candidates for membership must meet the following five requirements:

--New members must uphold democracy, including tolerating diversity.

--New members must be making progress toward a market economy.

--Their military forces must be under firm civilian control.

--They must be good neighbors and respect sovereignty outside their borders.

--They must be working toward compatibility with NATO forces.

Again, while these criteria are essential, they do not constitute a checklist leading automatically to NATO membership.

New members must be invited by a consensus of current members.

Decisions to invite new members must take into account the required ratification process in the member states. In the case of the United States, decisions are made in consultation with Congress.

The key determinant for any invitation to new members is whether their admission to NATO will strengthen the alliance and further the basic objective of NATO enlargement, which is to increase security and stability across Europe.",False,1664487597.0,t3_xqxon6,t1_iqf3zpp,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

It is a cause for concern. I think what a lot of people such as yourself are disregarding is that use of nuclear weapons isn't necessarily an all out attack with thousands of warheads flying towards the US. Security analys Joseph Cirincione for example states a few different scenarios of various degrees:

1) Limited use on a low-population area in Ukraine, or on a military target with casualties in the hundreds to thousands. \[Here I would infer from other sources that this would result in scenarios such as a NATO supported no-fly zone over Ukraine and way more military arms support from the west\].

2) A nuclear attack on Kiev \[or, I'm guessing, some other largely populated city\] with a proportionate conventional response from the US and its allies. 

3) The most unlikely scenario being a Russian nuke hitting NATO territory, resulting in the US/NATO responding with a proportional nuclear strike on a Russian target.

We have a huge competitive advantage in poppies, we have a Patented Strain that produces huge amounts of Thebaine, the main precursor needed for a lot of modern pharmaceuticals. Sure, go to Afghanistan if you want Codeine and Morphine, or come to Australia for Thebaine which can be turned into Codeine, Morphine and so many more derivatives.

Heavy Sanctions destroy countries like China, Russia etc because of **TWO** Factors:1: They have a huge population and not enough local resources to support it and 2: a disproportionate % of the population live at or below the poverty line.

Countries like Australia, Canada, NZ etc, maybe USA have a very low population to resource ratio so becoming self sufficient isn't a matter of IF but HOW.

When a country has a lot of poorer people, it takes less time for the sanctions to take effect and the country has less time to adjust before things become critical. Sanction China or Russia completely? Millions starve and die while the population and economy adjusts, and because of the mass unrest, adjusting is slower and harder. Sanction Australia or Canada completely? Thats a stimulus check, month or so off work while jobs are created and industries scaled up, maybe some people have it bad but we have charity and food banks etc that can lessen the blow.

Its my opinion, and I guess shared by a lot of people that Putin is not acting in his own, or in the interest of Russia. They have already lost this war at the strategic level, and none of their gains will make up for it anytime soon. And instead of trying to get out of the mess, they instead escalate at every opportunity.
