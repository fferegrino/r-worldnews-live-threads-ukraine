> On Monday, near Kyiv, chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team were attacked. Camera operator Richie Mockler took two rounds to his body armour, Stuart was wounded. Their experience illustrates the scale of the mayhem and violence as Russia's invasion enters a new and deadlier phase.

[...]

> The first round cracked the windscreen. Camera operator Richie Mockler huddled into the front passenger footwell. Then we were under full attack.

> Bullets cascaded through the whole of the car, tracers, bullet flashes, windscreen glass, plastic seats, the steering wheel, and dashboard had disintegrated.

> We didn't know it at the time, but we were later told by the Ukrainians that we were being ambushed by a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad. It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car - they didn't miss.

[...]

> At this stage we thought it was a Ukrainian army checkpoint firing at us and that it was a mistake, so we started screaming we were journalists, but the rounds kept coming.
> 
> We knew we had to get out to survive, but the incoming fire was intense.
> 
> Dominique pushed open her door a little further and slipped to the ground, crawling towards a motorway barrier and then dived down a 40-foot embankment, rolling to the bottom.
> 
> Richie was shouting to me, but I can't really remember much.
> 
> I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful.
> 
> And then I was hit in the lower back. ""I've been hit!"" I shouted.

[...]

> We spotted a factory unit with an open gate and sprinted one at a time inside, looking for cover. We were convinced the shooters would come to finish us off.
> 
> A door opened, and three caretakers beckoned for us to come inside their workshop.

[...]

> Attempts at levity fell on flat ears, eventually we gathered in a small office to keep warm, in silence, waiting for word of the rescue.
> 
> The phone rang, and we were told we had to wait until morning. It was by now pitch-black outside.
> 
> I began to doze on a couch, and I remember vaguely seeing a flashing light, then the sound of heavy boots and shouting in the stairwell.

The economic damage he is causing to Russia will reverberate for decades - it's not just a case of mathematical economic strength, but the psychological aspect of trust that he has completely decimated. 

All of the companies pulling out of a Russia right now will face tough opposition whenever they decide to resume operations, meaning that a lot of them will probably realise it makes more sense, even purely financially, to just avoid Russia entirely.

Putin tells Macron he intends to take all of Ukraine, but by the time they've asserted any sense of superficial control over the country, his own country will be starved of everything. 

Is this just a game of chicken? Is Putin just hoping that if he puts on a brave face, that the West will roll over and remove the sanctions?

Russia is not playing some type of beyond human IQ 4D chess. The more plausible explanation is that they have not managed to master combined arms... in 2022.


Blitzkrieg will always be the best battle strategy for the aggressive invader, as it literally gives the opponent no time to react or to organize themselves, and here Russia has totally failed.

Ukraine is probably much more powerful now than when this conflict started, and I bet Russia's momentum is more or less completely halted.

Re: The having destroyed the Ukrainian army bit.

At one point, at least, Putin stated that his ""objective"" was to crush the Ukrainian military so it could no longer threaten Russia, and to execute the ""dissident separatists"" that are causing all of the unrest in Ukraine, not to gain territory. 

He's also said that he will exit Ukraine only after having achieved his goals. 

Could he be looking for an out? His next statement might mention how most of those ""dissident separatists"" have been killed during this ""operation"".

I thought I was just making up a wild fantasy, but *could* that plane to Washington, D.C. be carrying someone to negotiate withdrawal terms?

“But there’s a reason. There’s a reason. There’s a reason for this, there’s a reason education sucks, and it’s the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It’s never gonna get any better. Don’t look for it. Be happy with what you got. Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. 

They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? 

They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain’t in it. You and I are not in the big club. And by the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head in their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table is tilted folks. The game is rigged, and nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. Good honest hard-working people -- white collar, blue collar, it doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on -- good honest hard-working people continue -- these are people of modest means -- continue to elect these rich cocksuckers who don’t give a fuck about them. 

They don’t give a fuck about you. They don’t give a fuck about you. They don't care about you at all -- at all -- at all. And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care. That's what the owners count on; the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that's being jammed up their assholes everyday.

1) Putin was right about the west ""getting over"" Ukraine and that if this lasts longer than 2 months the west will just get used to it and treat it like every other conflict in the world - send some occasional help but don't bother to be too active. My nation-wide TV News station is counting days since the war started - It's on 10 now but I can't imagine they'll still be doing that when the count will be in 100s     
2) For now NATO is occupied with the situation in Ukraine and everyone there seems to look up to Zelenskyy but as the situation gets worse they'll get tired of him calling them out on their bullshit and Zelenskyy's comments (like the one about ""weak"" NATO) instead of being a wake up call will turn into ""old man yelling at a cloud"" and NATO gets annoyed with it leaving Ukraine to deal with Russia by themselves

Edit: I fear most of the downvotes are because you're only reading the second paragraph. But disagreeing is fine...I figured this comment wasn't going to sit well, but needed to share.

This is just my opinion as I continue to watch this aggression in Europe unfold.

Russia is undoubtedly, and sadly, going to ultimately take all the major Ukrainian cities and install a pro-tem administrative government, but they'll never take the country. 

Ukrainian resistance will become an insurgency. Military leaders who escape capture will create and lead militias and become a thorn in Russia's side for years if not decades.

The thing is though, geopolitically speaking, Russia won't actually care. They'll prefer the controlled chaos over stability and democratic order. 

You know who else ""won't care""? 

NATO. (Edit: Changed from West to NATO due to issues with the use of ""The West"")

A Ukraine in turmoil helps Russia and NATO as sadistic as that may sound. I mean no offense here.

For NATO it keeps Russia bogged down.

I’m asking for facts. Don’t downvote me for asking for information. I have information for u that will break your heart but could end the war. This info summarizes the truth but is not popular at all.

Everyone can agree that we do not want any escalation to the point of nuclear bombs getting used. In fact, everyone can agree that we want this war to stop diplomatically. 

I can do this, but it skips all of the rhetoric and addresses the root issues of why things r the way they are.  I wish I could find this video back because it quickly puts an end to blaming Putin.  Putin certainly isn’t  a saint but it is understandable why he doesn’t want all Eastern block countries turned into NATO with nuclear weapons pointed at Russia.

I’ve been staying on top of the war in Ukraine. I’ve been reading what’s going on for > 12 hrs a day.  I lived thru the Cold War so I hated Russia as much as anyone. Now, I want to save the Ukraine people from a war that USA caused. 

Usa caused the expansionism of NATO in Europe to the east. We got Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and more to stop being aligned in Russia’s autocracy and join our democracy.  WE TOOK AWAY THE BUFFER STATES. Now we have our brand of government right smack on Russian borders…with their guns pointed at Russia.

No way in hell was USA gonna tolerate the Cuban Missile crisis with Russian weapons pointed at us right at our borders but we expect Russia to except NATO weapons on their borders.  Nobody wants to live terrified in fear.  

We need Russia to become NATO friendly if we want to avoid a future war with rising China.  NATO/USA actions r causing Russia and China to have stronger bonds. Meanwhile, Europe and USA r gaining stronger bonds.  We r planting the seeds of ww3.",1646495632.0,1646491965.0,t3_t78dh1,t3_t78dh1,,0,-54,0,-54,0,0,

I still think that's super unlikely, regardless of the play, but there's definitely a distinction in risk to be made depending on how you analyse the motive behind Putin's actions so far - if it's purely grandiose neuroticism driving it all, that's probably not a good sign.

Either way - hopefully, this marks the end of the Putin era. As much as it's maybe a bit of an unpopular opinion, I think Putin, when viewed purely in a vacuum about Russia specifically, did a lot for his country over the years - despite the collapse of the USSR, he continued to maintain Russia's geopolitical relevance that likely propped up the Russian economy for much longer than it otherwise might have been. That's probably the saddest part about this - he was actually effective for a while and the population genuinely benefitted during his tenure, for a while, and if he'd have just left in ~2008, his legacy would probably have been a net-positive one, both in Russia and internationally.

US and NATO trains for these sitautions multiple times per year in the mediterranean, in the arctic and asia.

The entirety of Russian military doctrine is about fighting nato, and they have always focused in anti aircraft defense because they know nato doctrine is about having air superiority, so they are leaders in radars and sams, not into getting air superiority themselves, which is why they don't have it in Ukraine, and all you see is occasional low altitude fighters.

5b8cbab228c0a2e98d77b62e1efe4c5a,t78dh1,hzgt8vv,"It's a complicated answer, but it boils down to two things:

First, the Russians lack the sensors to find and engage targets from higher altitudes. They don't use targeting pods, but rather they use built-in sensor suite that is limited to the forward and limited downward arcs.  This gives them a limited opportunity to locate, identify, and engage targets. They can't just orbit above the target out of range of SAMs, locate it with their sensors, and then perform a pinpoint strike like NATO can.

For comparison, NATO planes hang their targeting pods on pylons with the camera on a rotating gimbal that can see damned near behind the plane.

Second, even when they find the enemy, they lack the precision-guided equipment to effectively engage the targets. By lack I mean both in terms of quantity and quality of munitions. They have some laser-guided rockets & missiles (which requires them to be at low altitude). They also have some electro-optical (television-guided) bombs that they can drop from above, but the shitty weather prevents them from utilize it because they can't see through clouds. They also have some GLONASS-guided bombs, but those will be more inaccurate than other forms of guidance, and it requires them to be able to find the target in the first place (see problem number 1 above).

Regardless, the munitions they do have are believed to only be present in limited quantities and can only be used by a handful of jets.

This means that the Russians have to use unguided munitions. To destroy any given target, they have to use lots of them at low altitude. That puts them within the engagement envelope of MANPADS.",False,1646497808.0,t3_t78dh1,t1_hzgpxul,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

It seems so obvious in hindsight but something about it really cemented in my mind.  These were all people who could seriously be my fucking neighbors.  Right-left, ignorant or just uncaring.  You could just switch the pronouns and languages around and it could've easily been some Americans.

And, have mostly decoupled themselves from the American dollar with only 16%  their reserves in US currency.

 >Significant opposition to the Iraq War occurred worldwide, both before and during the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition, and throughout the subsequent occupation. People and groups opposing the war include the governments of many nations which did not take part in the invasion, and significant sections of the populace in those that did. Rationales for opposition include the belief that the war is illegal according to the United Nations Charter, or would contribute to instability both within Iraq and the wider Middle East.
 
**[Protests against the Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War)** 
 
 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

Heating a relatively small home in Italy during winter is reaching 400 euros per month if you want to keep them on between 11 am and 10 pm. My gf's granddad take 500 of pension, he either freezes or starves (actually he has savings, but it's dire).

Damage to economy and industry is a complete disaster as well. Already at the beginning of february in Italy thousands of business closed due to being unable to keep up with gas prices:

Yes, there is some legitimate animosity because of how Indians have been treated poorly and held at the border. But most people recognise that this simply does not compare with someone invading another nation on a whim.

Some also take issue with how nobody seems to care how millions of people from the developing world have gone through the same thing (or worse), without the West making as much as a sound. But that just makes people exasperated with Western hypocrisy - doesn't lessen what the people in Ukraine are going through, or make anyone favour Russia in this situation.

The right wing propaganda machine (which is practically an industry here), though, is going all guns blazing for Russia. Everyone I know that's pro-Russia are those ordinarily found suckling at the teat of this propaganda.

Frankly don't know why the machinery has been activated.

Yes. Completely stuck. There have been good twitter threads about it but long story short. It is super spread out, stuck in the mud ( because of bad post invasion vehicle maintainance ). The front of the convoy besides being stuck is out of fuel, that needs to be brought from the back and is difficult with roads being jammed by other vehicles. Cannot go around because mud and you get stuck. No supplies to the front, means they are running out of everything. They planned for 3 days and are in the 8th day. Also, they are not a countinuous line of 60km, rather dispersed on that space. But it's bad for them. Also Ucraine army is neutralizing them with small groups because as they run out of supplies ( ammo included ) they are sitting ducks. This is slow ofc, you can't just blow up all the thing because it is heavily armed, but as time passes, supplies dwindle at the front and no way in sight yet to bring them from the back. Mud is a key factor here + poor maintainance of trucks and other equipment that just makes their tires blow up. One factor also important: as time passes and they have to keep communications up, batteries are eventually drained and with no fuel in sight, well ... Also #2 it's f'in cold out there in the night, i don't understand where the soldiers manning the stuck stuff sit and sleep and how much longer this is feasible.

They would then be free to sign up and join Ukraine.  However, Russia would definitely know this and see through it as X country is sending in troops.

* Demilitarize Ukraine
* De-nazify Ukraine
* Independence for Donbass region

* Destroy the Ukrainian Military
* Kill or capture and depose the current administration
* Install a puppet who will recognize the ""independent"" region(s)

Russia then uses tactical nukes against NATO military targets in Ukraine. NATO refuses to back down and decides it has to disable Russia's ability to launch further nuclear attacks, perhaps by launching a surprise nuclear assault on Russia or by launching an electronic/conventional attack to disable it's nuclear strike ability. Russia fears that if it loses its nuclear strike capability then it will be totally conquered by NATO and so it unleashes a first strike against against all nuclear NATO countries.

Although, I will say regarding your point about all the destruction already happening: the danger of nuclear war isn’t the explosions.  The explosions are devastating, absolutely, but they aren’t why nuclear war must be avoided at all costs.  It’s the radiation, the way nukes poison a massive radius around the explosion site.

He seems to heavily underestimate motivation of ukrainian troops and to underestimate the value of actual combat experience.

He also seems to completely overestimate the russian planes.

He seems to overestimate ukrainian anti-navy capability as well, from what we have seen so far (though no assault took place so far, so I guess maybe not?).

I also think he over-estimate the importance of recon for the ukrainian. My guess is that they are fed intelligence from the US sattelites (to his credit, he does mention that as a possibility).",1646484632.0,1646484444.0,t3_t78dh1,t1_hzg0x2o,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

7876566c087b2e0ddc59b1ee37be382c,t78dh1,hzg2vf8,"Valery gerasimov, Russia’s enigmatic chief of general staff, once co-authored a short manual for his commanders, called “The principles of victory in combat”. Russian officers had become too predictable, he thought. Surprise is achieved by “striking the enemy at a time or place or in a manner for which the enemy is unprepared.” Yet it is hard to think of a less dynamic attack than the one approaching Kyiv from the north-west. A Russian military convoy, no less than 60km long, has been moving at snail’s pace towards the capital. It epitomises Russia’s plodding approach to the war so far.


The convoy stretches from Prybirsk, a town near Chernobyl, down to at least Antonov airport, the site of a Russian helicopter assault on the first day of the war. Its most recent location is hard to pin down, since the area has been cloudy in recent days. But on March 3rd British defence intelligence claimed, with some satisfaction, that the column had made “little discernible progress in over three days”. A day later an American defence official concurred, noting that it remained 25km from the centre of Kyiv.

Perhaps the most important reason for this is logistics. Russian fuel, engineering and other supply units have struggled to keep up with frontline forces, leaving vehicles stranded on the road. Video footage shows Ukrainian tractors gleefully towing away what are purported to be abandoned Russian air-defence systems and armoured vehicles.

In an article published on the War on the Rocks website in November, Alex Vershinin, an American army officer, noted that Russian units are far heavier on artillery and air-defences than their nato counterparts. This makes logistics tougher: a unit that fires 4,000 shells a day needs 50 trucks a day to replenish. Russia’s army would not have enough trucks to “meet its logistic requirement” more than 90 miles beyond supply dumps, he concluded.

Supplying a large invasion force in a huge country would stress any army. But Russia has further woes. “The Russians seemed to have fixed themselves to roads,” observes Mick Ryan, a retired major-general who led Australia’s defence college until recently. That, he says, has slowed them down. Mr Ryan points to the cautionary example of Operation Market Garden in 1944, the Allied effort to shorten the war by seizing crossings over the Rhine in the second world war. Britain’s xxx Corps made an arduous advance over a single narrow road, plagued by boggy ground on either side and German counter-attacks.

Russia’s repetition of that mistake may be a function of deeper military dysfunction. Trent Telenko, a former auditor for America’s Defence Contract Management Agency, has pointed to video footage of a Russian Pantsir-s1 air-defence system that was stuck in the mud and captured by Ukraine. Tires, he notes, need to be periodically moved to exercise the inflation system and to avoid exposing any one part to continuous sunlight.

That Russian forces have not done this basic maintenance may reflect endemic corruption. In 2019 Russian military prosecutors said that losses from corruption had spiralled and exceeded 7bn roubles (around $109m at the time). Neglected tires will fail to get through mud and must stick to paved paths. Images of the convoy show trucks crowded on the road, three abreast, preventing anything from passing. In some cases, Russian soldiers have even punched holes in their fuel tanks to avoid facing combat. Western officials say that the biggest problem is not that Ukraine has blown up key bridges, but that Russian bridging units have been unable to get through the congestion to build new ones.

Such a long and exposed convoy should be a juicy target for air strikes. Ukraine still has aircraft in the sky and its Turkish-made tb2 drones have struck Russian forces in other parts of the country. Yet Russia is likely to have deployed air-defence and electronic-warfare systems around the column, making it harder for Ukrainian aircraft to approach. Troops are another matter. The level of Ukrainian resistance has shocked Russian commanders. Just as German soldiers harassed the British column in Operation Market Garden, Ukrainians appear to be picking off elements of the Russian force.

There has been fierce fighting in Bucha and Gostomel, where the front of the convoy was estimated to be on March 1st, with images showing large quantities of destroyed Russian armour. On March 2nd Ukrainian forces claimed to have liberated the village of Makariv, to the south-west of the convoy. A day later they reportedly counter-attacked at Ivankiv, close to its northern end. American officials say that Ukrainian forces have used Javelin anti-tank missiles to destroy Russian tanks and block the road. At least three Russian commanders have been killed in different parts of the country after they ventured to the front, frustrated by their lack of progress.

Yet the fog of war remains thick. Russia may have chosen to slow down its movement in order to synchronise its various advances on Kyiv. Russian forces to the west of the Dnieper river have moved faster and farther than those to the east of it, which have been held up in fierce fighting. If the aim is to encircle Kyiv, in preparation for a siege, Russia might be waiting for its eastern thrust to catch up, suggests Mathieu Boulegue of Chatham House, a think-tank.

Progress in southern Ukraine has been quicker still, with Russian forces taking their first major city, Kherson, on March 2nd or 3rd and seizing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, on March 4th. Zaporizhzhia is only 85km to the city of Dnipro, a key junction and crossing point on the Dnieper. Prior to the war, Ukraine’s best and most numerous forces were in the east of the country, facing the Donbas region, the site of a Russian-backed proxy war. Those forces are at risk of being cut off from the rest of the country.

Nor is congestion unknown in big wars. The German advance into France in May 1940 was described as “the largest traffic jam in European history”, by Rolf-Dieter Müller, a German historian. It resulted in a 250km-long logjam through the Ardennes that ended 80km east of the Rhine. The Germans, of course, got there in the end.",False,1646484527.0,t3_t78dh1,t1_hzg2q7o,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

On the convoy tho, some things gathered from twitter and journalists and the ground + military professionals / contractors:

Yes. Completely stuck. There have been good twitter threads about it but long story short. It is super spread out, stuck in the mud ( because of bad post invasion vehicle maintainance ). The front of the convoy besides being stuck is out of fuel, that needs to be brought from the back and is difficult with roads being jammed by other vehicles. Cannot go around because mud and you get stuck. No supplies to the front, means they are running out of everything. They planned for 3 days and are in the 8th day. Also, they are not a countinuous line of 60km, rather dispersed on that space. But it's bad for them. Also Ucraine army is neutralizing them with small groups because as they run out of supplies ( ammo included ) they are sitting ducks. This is slow ofc, you can't just blow up all the thing because it is heavily armed, but as time passes, supplies dwindle at the front and no way in sight yet to bring them from the back. Mud is a key factor here + poor maintainance of trucks and other equipment that just makes their tires blow up. One factor also important: as time passes and they have to keep communications up, batteries are eventually drained and with no fuel in sight, well ... Also #2 it's f'in cold out there in the night, i don't understand where the soldiers manning the stuck stuff sit and sleep and how much longer this is feasible.

Theories include the Russians deliberately holding back as part of some strategy (unlikely, as lack of air superiority is costing them this war); fear of Ukrainian AA (reasonable, clearly, but likely an insufficient explanation on its own); a lack of munitions after extended operations in Syria (plausible); poorly trained pilots and lack of planning capacity to operate overwhelming numbers of planes over Ukraine effectively, without risk of friendly fire (best explanation I've seen); some reluctance within the Russian air force itself to participate in this war (completely unverifiable).

Russia is going to have a hard time going forward with any sort of combined arms offensives or targeted strikes (especially ones against hardened targets).

UK, France, Poland, Austria, Germany, Italy, Czechoslovakia, USSR, etc., in Europe. The continents of N. America, Europe, Africa, and Asia all saw battles (5/7 continents). (I don't recall S America, could be wrong).

Iraq/Afghanistan was relatively isolated to the US 9/11 attacks and Iraq/Afghanistan. There was spill over to Turkey, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, and the US used bases in UAE, Qatar, and Kyrgyzstan. Much more isolated area of conflict. 

Why does Russia get the WWIII threat tag? My best guess is China and Nuclear threat. If the attack of Ukraine spills to other countries, China may get squirrelly. They've been eyeballing Taiwan. If that kicks off, look for the Aussies and Canadians to get riled up.

If this all takes place, we'd potentially have active war fighting/bombing on 4 continents. And, that doesn't include everpresent potential firebomb around Israel. Who knows if Egypt gets the gang backtogether for a war longer than 6 days.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

He was the first commander of the volunteer militia Azov Battalion,[5][1][8][9] and a co-founder of the nationalist movement Social-National Assembly.[10][11][12][13][14][15] From 2014 until 2019 Biletsky was a Member of Ukrainian Parliament. 

>The goals of the ""Social-National Assembly"", that he co-founded, are ""the protection of the white race by creating an anti-democratic and anti-capitalist ""nationocracy"" system"" and the eradication of ""international Zionist speculative capital"".[33] In 2010, Biletsky said that it was the Ukrainian nation's mission to ""lead the white races of the world in a final crusade … against Semite-led Untermenschen"".[34]

>However, Biletsky declares that he is not racist or antisemitic.

First you have to understand there are two levels to coca Cola (which in honesty is more a marketing company than anything...they make brown sugar water!).  The main Coca Cola company controls the loved recipe to the flagship beverage and that could be cut off (sources I am reading as if this morning are saying they and Danone are pulling out).  The bottling companies that actually formulate many many different flavors around the world are another company with separate stocks and headquartered in different places.  So the bottling company may go on bottling some beverages or facsimiles of beverages even though the big daddy Coca Cola (headquartered in Atlanta, GA USA) is pulling out.  My research seemed to point at the Coca Cola bottler for Russia and Africa was listed on London Stock exchange and perhaps headquartered in Switzerland....but don't quote me as I am unclear. All that said no telling what PepsiCo (that owns Frito lay in the US) is doing.  Regardless I dare say that these items will become luxury products due to cost in a short time.  But even if soft drinks are allowed in Russia....they're horrible for you so it is kinda like selling them cigarettes and booze.  Win win.  No not letting Coke off the hook.

The existence of them in the guard, and the respect they get, is due to their actions against the original Russian invasion in 2014 -- so arguably, Russia kinda made them legit. From Ukraine, I see a lot of people do acknowledge these issues - usually calling the the far right.  


The rise of far right militias is a major issue in a lot of places now and while Ukrainian Government endorsing them in such a way is problematic - we only need to look at issues like the January 6th Insurrection to see a similar soft touch by government officials (imagine the support they would have if they had defended during an invasion). None of it is good but none of it as you say is a justification for the war atm. I would argue the scale of it is overblown.

On Thursday, the pillars of Russia’s independent broadcast media collapsed under pressure from the state. Echo of Moscow, the freewheeling radio station founded by Soviet dissidents in 1990 and that symbolized Russia’s new freedoms, was “liquidated” by its board. TV Rain, the youthful independent television station that calls itself “the optimistic channel” said it would suspend operations indefinitely.

And Dmitri A. Muratov, the journalist who shared the Nobel Peace Prize last year, said that his newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which survived the murders of six of its journalists, could be on the verge of shutting down as well.

“Everything that’s not propaganda is being eliminated,” Mr. Muratov said.

Precipitating the outlets’ demise were plans by the Russian Parliament to take up legislation on Friday that would make news considered “fakes” about Russia’s war in Ukraine punishable by yearslong prison terms. The Russian authorities have already made it clear that the very act of calling it a “war” — the Kremlin prefers the term “special military operation” — is considered disinformation.

“We’re going to punish those who spread panic using fakes by up to 15 years,” a senior lawmaker, Sholban Kara-ool, said on Thursday. During World War II, he said, such people “were shot on the spot.”

The crackdown on independent journalists — many of whom fled the country this week, fearing that even worse repressions were to come — added to the sense of crisis in Russia. The economy continued to reel from Western sanctions as airlines canceled more international flights and more companies suspended operations — including Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, a totem for Russia’s middle class and the employer of some 15,000 Russians.

Mr. Putin appeared unbowed by the crisis and the Western furor. He told President Emmanuel Macron of France in a phone call that his aim of securing “the demilitarization and neutral status of Ukraine” would be “achieved no matter what,” according to the Kremlin. A second round of peace talks in Belarus yielded no breakthrough, though Ukraine said Russia had agreed to “humanitarian corridors” to allow civilians to leave areas of intense fighting.",False,1646495554.0,t3_t78dh1,t1_hzgnlho,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Ukraine has been doing much better the last few years and there is large profit to be made as Ukraine developes it's economy. Putin wants all of that for himself and since he can't have it peacfully, he is now trying to take it by force. 

If you want historical facts. How about in 70's and 80's the USSR taking vast majority of production in Ukraine straight to Moscow and other big Russian cities while leaving very little for the people.

Utter crap.

Those countries wanted to join NATO because of fears of either Soviet reconstitution or Russian expansionism; the latter is literally happening before your eyes, and has been happening for three decades now.

> We got Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and more to stop being aligned in Russia’s autocracy and join our democracy.

That makes zero sense.

'Russia's autocracy' didn't exist when those states joined NATO. The Soviet Union fell apart all on its own; those subsequently independent nations A) chose to become democracies, B) chose to join NATO. Notice that some of them chose not to join NATO, the same way that Switerzland, Finaland, etc. chose not to. It's a choice.

Describing that as 'joining **our** democracy', let alone, as you imply 'US democracy' is simply absurd. That implies that those sovereign nations have joined a single government, which they did not.

> WE TOOK AWAY THE BUFFER STATES.

BUFFER STATES ARE FICTION.

You don't understand that concept: not the reasons it was created, and not why it's being used.

You're just swallowing Putin's 19th century imperial rhetoric.

> No way in hell was USA gonna tolerate the Cuban Missile crisis with Russian weapons pointed at us right at our borders but we expect Russia to except NATO weapons on their borders.

You do realise that invading Ukraine will *increase* the amount of NATO weapons on Russia's borders, right?

Right?

It's happening right now.

Like the Ukrainians, you mean?

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

""No! I don't want to be seen. By anyone!""

""I'm immune to the virus, I told you that already. It's safe to let me in.""

""It's never safe to be close, nyet!""

Xi dipped a finger into his honey pot, extracting a tiny drop of golden liquid. He put the finger to his lips. Sweetness.

""I have honey, Pooti. Lemme make you some honey and crackers.""

Silence.

Then, the click of the door unlocking.

Xi waited a beat, then opened the door.

The room was dark inside. The curtains, tall, opulent, red as Communism itself, were drawn. The lights were out. Xi waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness, then took a step in.

""Pooti? Why is it so dark in here?""

""I'm...afraid.""

""Big strong man like you? You've never been afraid in your life,"" said Xi, taking another step. His red shirt rolled over his tummy, and he pulled it back down.

""Of...what the world will think. If they saw me.""

""We don't care what the world thinks,"" said Xi. He took another step into the room. It was so dark, but the familiar shape of his beloved slowly resolved in his eyes. And...something else. What were those shapes over him? The curtains of their four-poster bed? Or something else?

""They'll call me a monster,"" said Putin, his voice cracking.

""They'll call us any name they choose, as long as they say 'Master' when we rule the world,"" said Xi. He sat down by Putin. They sat for a long time. In the dark. Xi heard an unfamiliar rustling sound.

""May I turn on the light, Pooti?""

""NO! No, not the light. I couldn't bear it,"" said Putin.

It fell into place. Xi set down his honey pot with regret. Put an arm around Putin's bare shoulder.

""You're not afraid of what the world will think, what they'll call you. You're afraid I will call you a monster. But I love you, Pooti. You're not a monster.""

Xi pulled the cord on the lamp by their bed, as he did every night.

Dramatic shadows sprang up around the room, but none so more than the ones cast by the wings sprouting from Putin's back. They were tall and elegant, with leathery membranes between strong bones, and the leading edges of muscles and tendons were covered in sleek black and red feathers.

""Don't look at me,"" whispered Putin, defeated. ""I'm a freak.""

Xi put a hand under Putin's chin, lifted his lover's face to his own. Looked into his eyes.

 >Simo Häyhä (Finnish: [ˈsimo ˈhæy̯hæ] (listen); 17 December 1905 –  1 April 2002), often referred to by his nickname, The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper in World War II during the 1939–1940 Winter War against the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30, a variant of the Mosin–Nagant rifle. Häyhä had also used a submachine gun, the Suomi KP/-31. He is believed to have killed over 500 men during the Winter War, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war.

There's no way that the world will cower in that situation and remove sanctions, not only out of fear of Putin and his nukes, but more long-term, it would undermine so much of the progress we have made as a world. 

In the modern day, wars aren't generally fought predominantly with soldiers and tanks, they're fought economically - multilateralism across the world and the interlinking of the economies of individual countries with that of other, hugely influential countries makes war far less practical than it was in the past; countries rely on import and export, access to financial institutions, geopolitical stability on the basis of unity etc.

If sanctions were relaxed on the basis of a nuclear threat, it would set an incredibly dangerous precedent - you can do whatever you want, provided you have nuclear weapons and a leader with a high enough likelihood of being authentically mentally unstable. Whilst it might help in the short-term to de-escalate this particular situation, as a civilisation, we would be invoiced later, with interest, in the form of further power grabs immunised against interference by nuclear weapons. 

Personally, I don't think many nations want to set that precedent. At this point, I think most of the EU and NATO are committed to the sanctions, and if that situation arises they will navigate it as it happens.",False,1646486793.0,t3_t78dh1,t1_hzg4mtz,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Don't even need a passport for that. But I have lived in Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, New York, Texas, Utah, Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Missouri. If you were to transpose the map on to Europe, that's living all across western Europe and I'm guessing getting into Russia some. 

So while yes, everyone is American, there are pockets of different cultures everywhere. In St. Louis I had a middle eastern grocer right behind my hotel. We actually worked with them and the local mosques to start hosting their travellers during weddings. In Pennsylvania, Hasidic Jews came and stayed there every year during Passover. Can't get out of the hotel industry without working with Indians, either, and they genuinely treat you like family if you are there for any time at all. Still get calls from them years later. 

Anyways, that's just the tip of the iceberg and the point is this: you can live your whole life in America, never leave, and still experience a significant number of cultures. You can also isolate yourself into one little corner of America and do everything you can to avoid those cultures out of fear, so it's definitely a mixed blessing.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

The treaty prevents Ukraine and Russia from invading one another's country respectively, and declaring war. Ukraine announced its intention not to renew the treaty in September 2018.

 >East German jokes, jibes popular in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR, also known as East Germany), reflected the concerns of East German citizens and residents between 1949 and 1990. Jokes frequently targeted political figures, such as Socialist Party General Secretary Erich Honecker or State Security Minister Erich Mielke, who headed the Stasi secret police. Elements of daily life, such as economic scarcity, relations between the GDR and the Soviet Union or Cold War rival, the United States, were also common. There were also ethnic jokes, highlighting differences of language or culture between Saxony and Central Germany.

You might be right that I'm short-sighted in how much banning travel or seizing assets would be in NATO countries would be, as there are plenty of other places people could go.

Thanks for making me think more about this, I do not have a good answer. I think that blocking travel to NATO countries before this happened might have been a good idea, or not granting new visas now? Perhaps larger seizures of assets, beyond just the oligarchs? I don't want peoples families to be torn apart, but I do think that there is no luck for change if the common, or at least upper class person doesn't share some of the burden for their governments misdeeds.

Another idea I had before was a scaled-in approach depending on wealth, so start with anyone that has $10m in foreign assets and work your way down.

But you seem to have ignored this in your post.

> (it is a democracy and it is not a Putin dictatorship

A democracy where the current president (Zelensky) shut down opposition media, imprisoned the head of the opposition party that came second in the elections, and arrested and imprisoned its leaders? That democracy? The president who wanted Serhiy Sternenko (former leader of neo-Nazi Right Sector in Odessa (where he was directly implicated in the 2014 Trade Unions House massacre of 46 people) as head of Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) in Odessa? That democracy?

In one sense, we're already fighting World War III and arguably have been for many years. It just wasn't conventional warfare.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare

5th generation warefare is still a form of war, and Putin's regime and oligarchs have been undermining stability in the west and agitating extremism since at least 2014 when the Obama era sanctions began. Perhaps earlier. Those of you who remember social media history should realize that 2014 was a key year for a huge amount of social destabilizing movements in the english speaking world, especially online. BLM rose and was co-opted by troll farms to sew as much division and possible and undermine it. (This is NOT me in any way condeming BLM itself. By and large, I personally support the movement.)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_and_Black_Lives_Matter

GamerGate rose from the chan boards that summer and completely overtook the website, it later became a huge rallying point for the alt-right and the same demographics that would later evolve into radical online Trump support. It got so bad that the original 4chan founder was ousted from the website. This became an extension of the MRA vs Feminists movements which were already likely being fanned by Russia as well.

The more we learn, the more we realize that Brexit also has heavy ties to Putin. Brexit was also predicted in what is essentially Putin's political Bible in ""The Foundation of Geopolitics"" as far back as 1997. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_Brexit_referendum

The rest of 2016 speaks for itself.

2017 started QAnon on 4chan and that spiraled into its own thing with early russian backings. From QAnon we got antivaxxers and just about every other extreme right wing movement. And in all these years, militant white supremacist movements got huge boosts too.

There has been a substantial change in people's behavior since I'd say about 2012 onward, but 2014 was when it really started to take off and far right fanaticism in the west truly began to be amplified. And all of it benefited Putin.

Putin has been at war with the west and literally any form of western democracy for at least 8 years already. Only in the past week has the west finally started using economic means to truly fight back. I don't want this to end in a nuclear firefight at all, and I also still believe that's the most unlikely outcome, by far. I just want people to realize how bad things have already gotten because of Putin's administration even outside of Russia.

The right wing head consistently lured about these positions because they want to maintain a rigid social hierarchy with white men at the top. Feminism is not, and never has been, about displacing men. Yes, it does displace shitty men who openly commit social violence against their fellow citizens and who hold their power due to a rigged system, but this is something we should all cheer.

Here is a great example, we have a law in Texas that says it is a crime to allow your child to be transgender. Find me a single law that says it is a crime to not let your kid be transgender?

The left/right debate is a simple one, freedom vs hierarchy. Are ""All (hu)Men Created Equal and Endowed by Their Creator With Inalienable Rights"" or, as the right suggest, are some groups of people innately superior to others and should therefore be allowed to rule over society?

The origin of the term ""dictator"" came from the Roman Republic; a dictator could be appointed in time of war, for a year, to assume total control of government. Since then it's been a bit gauche for a king, presidente or generalissimo to style themselves as a ""dictator"" but it amounts to the same thing. The USSR went through a profound change after Stalin's death, which moved them slightly from the cult of a (now dead) dictator to the cult of a revived Party. Plus la change from the West's perspective, but it did release some of the pent-up personal grievances (Stalin was, after all, a monster and no one in that regime was untouched).

Rather than dictatorship it's helpful to think of totalitarianism as a pattern that rulers have of ruling, and servants have of serving. This pattern of thinking still applies in Russia today, right now, in this war, in the way that no one will question Putin. It's not because he dictates, specifically. It's because *fear is total*. Everyone probably knows this war is stupid. But everyone is terrified that if they say what they think to their friend, their neighbor, their coworker, then that person will rat them out and get them arrested. Totalitarianism is where normal human-to-human conversation is completely saturated with fear of the regime, and you can't even trust your spouse or your children. Whatever the USSR was after Stalin, the totalitarian nature of it never went away, and Putin understands it and has revived it to its fullest extent.

Do you have any idea of the consequences of what you suggested?  
First, you have to take into account Putin's main reason for his rise to power: Chechnya. They had a separatist movement. Or ANOTHER one for the russian power base (be it the people, be it the admin apparatus, be it the Bourgeoisie - often called ""oligarchs"" when dealing with the russians). He ""dealt"" with it with his trademark. Force. That's his power basis. He ""brings back power"" to Russia, to have it ""respected"" on a world stage - at least that's the Kool-aid he's selling. And they drink it. They drink it all up.  


Now, how could this MO react to an ultimatum of offensive action by NATO right up to his borders, when all of the reasoning of his actions is to deter this very situation from materializing? Are you REALLY gonna play a fucking game of chicken with the fate of the world on your hands with these actors? Why? Cause you have a ""hunch"" they will not act? Because it's the reasonable course of action? Well... NUCLEAR ULTIMATUM (which is the defended course of action) is already past the ""reasonable"" bar, by a longshot. The reasonable ANSWER to that is to gear up and get ready for nuclear war. The logical conclusion IS INDEED nuclear war.  


And you are CLEARLY already defending such actions. The appeasement by Chamberlain was not an attempt to STOP war but to BUY TIME for the INEVITABLE altercation - And I fucking hate that people continue to misunderstand that. Your discourse is clearly indicating that WAR is INEVITABLE, and the moment of action is NOW better than LATER. You could not be more wrong.  


War between the two super-powers is a lose-lose-lose situation. The US loses. Russia loses. My own Brazil loses, as anyone else 'cause we all fucking die together as humans, not any nationalities. You are asking for nuclear holocaust! ""Because it's inevitable"". Fuck you and your propaganda-riddled mind. Let the fucking grown-ups with a rational mind do the talking.
