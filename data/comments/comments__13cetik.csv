>Ukraine’s human and material losses during World War II were enormous. Some 5 to 7 million people perished. Even with the return of evacuees from the east and the repatriation of forced labourers from Germany, Ukraine’s estimated population of 36 million in 1947 was almost 5 million less than before the war.

>Because more than 700 cities and towns and 28,000 villages had been destroyed, 10 million people were left homeless. Only 20 percent of the industrial enterprises and 15 percent of agricultural equipment and machinery remained intact, and the transportation network was severely damaged.

The T-34, an 83-year-old relic, has traditionally opened the annual display of military might because of its symbolic role in helping Russia overcome Nazi Germany.  
However, the Soviet-era tank is normally accompanied by more modern fighting machines in a full display of Moscow’s military might.

Against the backdrop of today's seemingly humiliating and drastically scaled down Victory Parade comes a prediction that senior Kremlin figures may find ominous.

Igor Girkin, a former Russian commander and FSB officer who helped annex Crimea in 2014, is widely believed to be Russia's most influential cheerleader for the invasion of Ukraine.

But in a post to his nearly 800,000 followers on Telegram, he is effectively for the first time predicting that Russia will be defeated by Ukraine - suggesting this could happen relatively quickly.

""There is no strategy - there is no conscious work for its implementation,"" he says.

""And the enemy initially has such a strategy and he implements it with all his might. More and more successfully, as the Kremlin 'plays giveaway' with inexplicable rapture and childish confidence in the final 'negotiation'...

""Now we need to think about how to save the state, country and people in a situation of imminent military defeat. And, yes, - even for a 'worthy non-fatal defeat' (in which the enemies will be forced to abandon their plans for the complete fragmentation of Russia and the elimination of its sovereignty), it will be necessary to fight long and hard.""

So that people can temper their expectations about the new aid package: This is a USAI package, not a Presidential Drawdown, so it is not material that is going to immediately appear on the front lines. It will be contracted for, which means it is either going to be purchased from existing stocks in the US or elsewhere, or will have to be manufactured.

Points I found interesting:

>So we continue to try to leverage the full range of contracting vehicles that we have at our disposal to expedite getting needed security assistance to Ukraine, to include vehicles **that allow us to start work immediately, in terms of some of those capabilities, before waiting for final contracts or broader contracts to be signed.**

*********************************

>Q: I just wanted to double check -- you -- you did confirm -- you did confirm that a Patriot downed this Kinzhal missile ... 

>GEN. RYDER: Correct.

*******************************************

>Q: You can't confirm if the U.S. Patriots are now over there?

>GEN. RYDER: The U.S. Patriot is over there.

That last bit is from someone who kept wanting to know which Patriot system shot down the Kinzhal - American, German, or Dutch - and for some reason found the lack of specifics an indication that the US provided Patriot system wasn't there yet? 

I didn't understand that - why does it matter which one shot it down? They're all American-made Patriot systems, aren't they? If anyone has a better understanding of that, I'd appreciate having it explained to me.

*****************************************

>Q: Also, I just had a quick follow-up on the -- on the Kinzhal. Is -- is this the first time -- or the first intercept of a hypersonic missile in combat? And do you have the date of the intercept?

Recent aerial cruise missile launches were giving me the feeling that something is not right. Usually the number of missiles in the attack were number of planes x number of missiles for particular mission. And always that number should be even. Recently it was 25, with 8 Kalibrs. So 17 ALCMs. With TU-95 they can carry from up to 6 to 16 (depending on version ) ALCMs. There were 7 planes in the air. Even with just 4 missiles each, that's 28 missiles, not 17. So I started looking for pictures. One missile hit a garden patch, other one fell down near the city. Few other pictures just confirmed my suspicion.

https://t\.me/operativnoZSU/95540?single

That's Kh-55. That Kh-55 that had just less than 50% chances to properly follow it's programmed path. Earlier Ukrainians were saying they counted around 30 launches, but that information was dismissed as a mistake, because only 17 missiles were registered over Ukraine + 8 Kalibrs, so it was understood that those 30 launches were including Kalibrs. Well - no. Missile that fell near Kiyv - Kh-55. Missile from the picture above - Kh-55. Only two missiles hit anything, and we have confirmation that only one actually detonated. I would speculate now that most of those missiles in that strike were Kh-55 decoys, with just a few Kh-101s. Russia is using currently produced missiles, so it means they don't have stockpiles of Kh-101 and at the current rate they are making 15-20 Kh-101s per month. With recent upgrades to Ukraine air defense it means they can hit one or two targets PER MONTH. Recent interception of Kh-47M2 shows that even that option can soon be off the table for Russia. Also some very well informed report says they had 50 of them at the beginning of this year. So maybe Kh-22s? Recently from 6 missiles one hit chicken meat warehouse. And that was the only hit from that salvo. To my surprise - some of them were shot down. Oh so then maybe Kalibrs? Nope. They can't make them unless someone will smuggle parts for them  (Iran?).They are down to what's in missile launchers and erratic production of 10-20 average per month. 
So maybe they are stockpiling their ammo? The reasonable assumption would be to have at least one full reload for their carriers. Russians are not reasonable and are way past that critical level. 

So yes - now we can say it. Russia ran out of long range cruise  missiles.",False,1683658507.0,t3_13cetik,t3_13cetik,,0,98,0,98,0,0,

*Order of succession & interim presidency:*

There’s an order of succession if Putin dies in office.  And the next guy up would absolutely end the war.  He was opposed but chose to stay quiet.  He would attempt to reset the course of Russia on the international stage, while also appeasing the elites.  This is Mishustin—he’s currently the prime minister and is moderately well liked, very experienced, and most importantly, not bonkers.  (After him is a woman, a Ukrainian native, ironically, who feigns a desire for peace, but would likely not immediately end war because would want to appear tough. And any peace she tried to broker would entail keeping territories, anyway.  She fakes the Russian patriotism lines, goes full nutso on the Nazi talk, when it suits her goals.)

Depending on how well this interim-presidency period goes, would determine whether there’s an immediate election or that’s suspended ‘due to upheaval.’ Basically, it all depends on how the next in line, a interim President Mishustin, performs.  And that cannot be predicted. He’d have to walk a narrow path of appeasing elites while making amends abroad, including concessions—a near impossible task.  However, if he can secure powerful allies in a short period—like Sobyanin, Gref, etc—then other elites would support the concessions.  

*New election:*

For next election, there’s three ways it could go.  First, the elites rig it to install who they promised Putin would be heir.  Like Dyumin or Patrushev (Jr.).  Someone who’d continue Putin’s vision and goals. 
Second is that the elites still control election, but they overrule what Putin wanted and put in a heady-type, who will slowly try to right the course, without any major upheavals.   Like keeping Mishustin, or putting in Dmitriyev [finance guy] or Naryshkin or even that Elvira lady—someone who they think will quietly right the course, steady the ship, at least get Russia back to where it was.  (For this, they’d need someone who holds at least moderate respect by the West, but is still an insider, ie, one of them.)

 Or, third, this could be a moment of transformation and have quasi free elections, putting in a “transformational” figure—the way Gorbachëv was—allowing for sweeping change—a Navalny type.  This is less likely, but not impossible. And if things are in dissarray, the elites unable to organize, this could emerge.  The difficulty is more that there’s less people like this out there, than there previously were. 

*Also on the interim and post-interim:*

See Russia will need its own economic perestroika, but before can do that, it’s got to make all sorts of mea culpas internationally—reparations, handing over war criminals—which is essentially a public humiliation.  Someone has to be at the helm that can navigate it without harming elites too much.  *If* Mishustin can’t do that, if he can’t show that Russia can be rebuilt, reintegrated into the world, while the elites are not harmed—then, the elites will proceed to regular election, and swing way to the right—they will pick one of the ultra nationalists to be next ‘elected’ president—like Volodin, or god forbid, Zolotov, or the like.  And Russia will be even farther gone than under Putin.

If he *can* navigate it, they’ll either keep him, or select someone [they would prefer someone younger] who will just quietly do the reconstruction of Russia, who can better the elites lives and also help to regain their standing on the world stage.  Someone like Kirill Dmitriyev—once named as being groomed to be Putin’s heir [this has been said of many, though]—is American-educated, helmed a multi-billion dollar fund in Russia which was similar to USAID, is close to Putin bc his wife and Putin’s daughter and close friends, and was opposed to the invasion.  He’s a level headed financial type, respected internationally, yet never had elected office so elites would think they could control him.  He’s the type that they’d install to right Russia’s course after the interim period.  But there are others who fit this profile, too.",1683667703.0,1683657551.0,t3_13cetik,t1_jjhof7y,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

When trapped in a dilemma, emphasize the dilemma, and you will be forgiven.  Attempt to resolve it, either way, and you will be punished. 

Putin has a dillema.  His military is over-stretched and under-equipped across a massive front.  Commanders everywhere are requisitioning what they need to hold the line, and aren't getting it.   They are doing this at least in part to prove that they are not incompetent when the inevitable comes.  Somewhere along that line.  

He also has a day of absolutely critical cultural importance, central to the ""iron fist"" that allows muscovy to rule, at which he must have military equipment. 

He can't put scarce military equipment in both places.  Where does he put it? 

Let's say he holds his parade.  And somewhere on the front, muscovy's forces collapse.  That commander and the entire upstream line all the way to MOD will point to muscovy's political prioritization of a parade over military effectiveness. That plays right into Wagner's prepositioning.  

And if he has no parade, that will be humiliation too... but ""security concerns"" give it an air of legitimacy.

Dillema. Everyone knows Russia's getting humiliated somewhere. 

Humiliation is inevitable, but blame is not.  Putin can survive the blame for not holding a massive parade, as long as he holds some parade.  But he is unlikely to survive being a plausible reason muscovy's military was defeated somewhere.

I think the bigger problem is not so much destroyed vehicles though. I think it's things like barrel wear that is the bigger problem for them.

Britain prepares to send long-range missiles to Ukraine

The U.K. is pushing the Biden administration into providing Ukraine with weapons that can reach further into Russian-held territory







Britain, which has prided itself on being ahead of its Western allies in introducing new weapons systems to Ukraine, now appears poised to send Kyiv the long-range missiles the Biden administration has long denied it.



In a procurement notice posted May 2 by the British-led International Fund for Ukraine, a group of northern European countries that has set up a mechanism to send weapons to the battlefield, the United Kingdom’s Defense Ministry asked for “expressions of interest” in providing strike capabilities with a range of up to 300 kilometers, or nearly 200 miles. The notice asked for responses within three days.

No final decision has been made, according to a British official who declined to confirm the type, timing or quantity of weaponry under consideration. But the notice is a substantive step toward Britain itself supplying such munitions, and the requested specifications and capabilities closely match its air-launched Storm Shadow cruise missiles.



Ukraine has long pleaded with Western nations for longer range missiles, arguing that such weapons could change the course of the war by allowing its forces to target Russian command centers, supply lines, ammunition and fuel dumps deep inside Crimea and Russian-held territory in eastern Ukraine. As Kyiv prepares to launch a major counteroffensive as soon as within the next several weeks, the ability to strike far behind Russia’s front lines would help clear the way for a ground assault with tanks and infantry troops.



Storm Shadows can be mounted on Ukraine’s Soviet-made jets and reach into Russian territory. Kyiv has long sought that capability, and tried to ease Western escalation fears with pledges it would refrain from using donated weapons in such attacks.

“If we could strike at a distance of up to 300 kilometers, the Russian army wouldn’t be able to provide defense and will have to lose,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the European Union earlier this year. “Ukraine is ready to provide any guarantees[ ](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-to-send-ukraine-longer-range-bombs-in-newest-package)that your weapons will not be involved in attacks on the Russian territory.”



Moscow has charged that Kyiv has adapted drones for long range use in what have been sporadic attacks deep inside Russia. Kyiv has not asserted responsibility for any of the attacks, but has claimed its right to hit internal Russian targets with its own weapons.



Concerns that Ukraine would fire missiles at targets in Russia is a key reason the administration has repeatedly rebuffed Ukrainian pleas to supply long-range U.S. munitions.

The United States has provided multiple-launch precision rocket systems, including the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, but only with munitions whose range is limited to about 50 miles. In a weapons package announced earlier this year, the Pentagon said it will send Ukraine [Ground-Launched Small-Diameter Bombs (GLSDB) ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/02/03/ukraine-small-diameter-bombs/?itid=lk_inline_manual_17) with double that range. They can also be fired from HIMARS, but delivery is not expected until later this year at the earliest.

HIMARS also has the capability to fire the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, a munition with a range equal to that of the Storm Shadow’s 300 kilometers. But the Biden administration has been unyielding in denying Ukrainian appeals for those weapons, with Pentagon officials, in addition to fears of escalating the conflict, citing short supplies in U.S. arsenals.





British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has dismissed talk among Ukraine’s benefactors of their depleted stockpiles. “If there is a moment in this conflict we can make a difference, why not seize it? What are we waiting for?” he asked of European allies at the Munich Security Conference in February. “What is the purpose of these stockpiles? If the weapons are degrading Russian armed forces, that is increasing our security.”



Weeks before those remarks, according to a previously unreported file included among the classified U.S. documents [leaked online through the Discord messaging platform,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/discord-leaks/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23) U.S. intelligence confirmed Britain intended to send Ukraine an unspecified number of Storm Shadow missiles, along with British personnel to aid in targeting.

“The United Kingdom will be the first country to provide Ukraine with longer range weapons,” Sunak said in his Munich speech.

Being first is something Britain has striven for throughout the war, beginning under former prime minister Boris Johnson. After the United States, Britain has been the second-largest supplier of Ukraine military aid — contributing $2.5 billion worth of munitions last year. Though that’s only a fraction of what Washington has provided, the British have claimed the cutting edge, sending some of the first shoulder-launched anti-air and antitank weapons to combat Russia’s February 2022 invasion, and more recently by training pilots on NATO-standard fighter jets.



In mid-January, Britain broke through allied reluctance to send heavy tanks to Ukraine by unilaterally [announcing it would send ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/01/14/challenger-2-tanks-ukraine/?itid=lk_inline_manual_28)14 British-made Challenger tanks. The United States, Germany and others in Europe eventually followed suit in promising to send their own heavy armor.

“It’s a position the United Kingdom can uniquely do [since] Russia doesn’t like us very much anyway,” said the same British official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about internal alliance issues. “We know that if we give something it makes it slightly easier for others.”

“There is definitely a different risk tolerance among different countries. We’re often in an earlier place,” the official said, citing the pilot training, even though no country has yet agreed to provide the NATO-standard aircraft, particularly F-16s, that Ukraine has asked for.



While U.S. policy remains unchanged, Pentagon officials expressed no concern when asked about the prospect of Britain sending long range missiles to Ukraine. “Each country makes their own sovereign decisions on what types of security assistance and what kinds of equipment they provide,” said Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder. “We commend the significant support that allies and partners from around the world, including the United Kingdom, are providing to Ukraine.”

U.S. lawmakers of both parties who support an aggressive stance have repeatedly urged the administration to provide Ukraine with ATACMS and F-16s. In a[ statement ](https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-graham-blumenthal-on-us-germany-sending-tanks-to-ukraine)issued after late-January announcements by Germany and the United States that they, too, would send tanks, Democratic Sens.

Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), along with Republican Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) urged “the Biden administration and our allies to send more long range artillery, such as ATACMS and fighter aircraft.”

“I’ve long been pushing for the longer range, ATACMS, for example,” Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a military veteran who served in Iraq, said at the Hudson Institute two weeks ago. “I think it’s time to do that. We see less and less talk about escalation” as Russian President Vladimir Putin has crossed “every red line,” Crow said. “The Ukrainians have proven themselves to be responsible partners” and “have every incentive” to abide by restrictions on long-range weapon use, lest they lose Western support.

The distance between Ukrainian-held territory and Sevastopol, Crimea’s largest city and the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, is within the range of the Storm Shadow, which was originally developed as an Anglo-French project in the early 1990s and is held in the arsenals of a number of countries in Europe and the Persian Gulf. Used by Britain in Iraq in 2003, and by Britain, France and Italy in Libya in 2011, it has been adapted to fit on a number of different aircraft.

The weapons would allow Kyiv’s forces to adopt tactics already in use by Russia, which launches “cruise missiles [from aircraft] inside their own territory to be beyond Ukrainian air defenses,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser to the Center for Strategic and International Studies International Security Program who has specialized in weapons systems used in the Ukraine war.

“All you need to do is give it ten digit coordinates,” Cancian said of the missile targeting. “There’s nothing else you need to do intelwise.”

If we ever get into a real war (say with China) we’re going to need to significantly expand the military and quickly. One of the huge concerns about Europe is force generation - they have small, professional militaries but after that, the cupboard is pretty bare. If say Germany or the UK have to mobilize tomorrow, there won’t be a lot of gear around to equip the troops. So the AFU needs every vehicle it can get its hands on to equip their new units. Second, NATO gear is significantly ahead of Soviet/Russian gear. It has to do with the respective design philosophies. Russian/Soviet tanks were manufactured at a scale greater than the West. They were smaller and lighter which meant less resources. It also increased mobility because less weight meant more bridges you could use, which is huge if you’re planning an offensive through Europe. Low profiles so a more difficult target. Simple design meant it could be mastered by conscripts quickly. Soviet doctrine was to punch through NATO defenses and then push this massive armored fist through. They didn’t care about losses - plenty more where that came from. Western tanks were designed with only one purpose in mind - to kill other tanks. Their bigger and heavier and carry more armor so they’re more survivable. They also have blow out panels so if the ammo cooks off, the crew doesn’t barbecue with the tank (trained crews are just as valuable). In tank warfare, whoever gets the first shot off has the best chance of winning. So Western tanks have better optics and fire control so they’re more likely to shoot first and put steel on target. They have a four man crew compared to three for Russian tanks (human loader compared to an autoloader). The French LeClerc is an exception. But a four man crew has some advantages. Extra pair of eyes scanning for danger or and extra pair of hands for maintenance is a big edge in the field to help keep your tank in the fight.

Now even though Ukraine captured a lot the Russians still have plenty more available for themselves. So even if they captured let's imagine Ukraine has dealt with 50% of Russia's tanks and of that they managed to capture 10% they still have 20 times that amount coming at them yet. So they need more tanks.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,13cetik,jjj1bgl,"I mean, financially and economically, the quality of life improved drastically compared to the 90s. That result is certainly far more noticeable in urban cities, to be sure, and of course it was much less Putin and more a fortunate series of events that led to the possibility for the increase in living standards. Of course I don't speak about politics - while economics improved, political freedoms were quickly demolished, but for many Russians, the solution to that was as simple as ""nothing to hide, nothing to fear"". The social contract was to keep their head down and turn a blind eye to politics, and in exchange, urban Russia was well rewarded.

There is even the term ""pumpkin latte syndrome"", used to refer to an urban Russian (typically from Moscow or Petersburg) who is so spoilt for choice that when they travel abroad and realise they can't get their pumpkin lattes (or whatever other super specific thing they can easily get at home), they get disappointed and complain. Of course the whole pumpkin latte thing was just one Russian instagrammer who went viral and obviously is a bit caricatured, but it does highlight a bizarre privilege that many urban Russians enjoyed (and largely still enjoy despite sanctions). 

It is one of the reasons that, despite being from NZ, I fell in love with Petersburg a long time ago and quickly settled down. Banking systems and paying was so easy, quick, and efficient. Work opportunities were great. I was earning 4000 USD a month in 2013 teaching English. Internet is the fastest I've ever experienced anywhere in the world, and incredibly cheap. The city has anything and everything I could ever want, and plenty more that I'd never think of wanting. You can get literally anything you want (except alcohol) delivered to your door in 30 minutes, at any time of day, any day of the week. You could order a toilet seat, a bouquet of flowers, and a loaf of bread if you wanted. Public transport is everywhere, reliable, and frequent. Culturally, it has more museums than I could visit in a lifetime, world-class classical music performance, beautiful landmarks. Income may look low if you compare it directly to USD and poverty undoubtedly exists here, but even the gopniks have smartphones and own apartments, and home ownership is certainly a lot more common than in NZ. I'd never be able to afford to buy a home in NZ as an English teacher, but here I am 34 years old and I have an apartment with no mortgage. Before the war, the main reason my Russian wife didn't want to relocate to NZ is because of the *massive* downgrade in quality of life that we could have.

I don't say any of this to praise or paint Russia as some sort of good place, or defend this country. Russia is the perpetrator of atrocities and war crimes and we do not deserve to live so well when Ukrainians suffer so much. My point is more that I don't think people outside Russia really appreciate or realise how extreme and bizarre the dissonance between political tyranny and oppression on one side, and economic privilege on the other. Things are getting worse, sure. Especially this year, the veil is starting to come off, and I expect it won't be much longer before the illusion disappears entirely. I hope then people might finally realise what their ignorance cost them. 

Still, I apologize - this is a very long-winded way to say that standards of living invariably improved!",1683670497.0,1683670284.0,t3_13cetik,t1_jjird97,,4,7,0,7,0,0,

Why?

Overestimating Muscovy appears to have been a problem for decades.  The West has been running scared of a pathetic, worthless military which would be completely destroyed with almost no Western losses in a conflict.

There is absolutely no reason to believe their vaunted nukes exist let alone whether any of them would actually work.  They had barely a dozen ballistic missile systems on their parade which was **desperate** for military vehicles.  Their planes are non-existed or outdated wrecks, their submarine fleet are death traps.

Muscovy needs to start being estimated as far less capable than it has been.  It should be treated the way it deserves and swatted out of existence.",False,1683676077.0,t3_13cetik,t1_jjjbwgk,,4,17,0,17,0,0,

They may be happy to sell Russia some weapons but the demand for weapons for this war is ridiculously high and Iranian weapons production is not close to being able to meat it and the same goes for Belarus, North Korea and Syria. Iran and Syria also have enough problems going on that they don’t want to be left defenseless and so they won’t empty their stockpiles for Russia. 

In terms or China lethal military aid to Russia seems pretty unlikely. If they were going to do it they would have done it earlier when the odds of Russia actually winning we’re greater. China doesn’t care what happens in the Donbas and if China goes all in backing Russia they risk sanctions and they risk alienating Europe. If NATO members become united against China it would be a horrific result for Beijing. By staying relatively neutral on the war China can avoid a serious confrontation with Europe meanwhile they can still buy up Russian resources for cheap. 

Russia shouldn’t be underestimated and it will take a lot more work to beat them. Realistically I don’t see Ukraine liberating all the occupied territories this year but at the same time they don’t have unlimited weapons, funds or manpower and they’re “allies” are only able and willing to help so much.
