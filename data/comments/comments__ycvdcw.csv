>Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of four Ukrainian oblasts on September 30 ignited a schism within the Kremlin, which will likely intensify as Ukraine liberates more territories, according to Budanov. Budanov stated that Kremlin elites largely did not support Putin’s decision to annex Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts prior to securing those territories, prompting many officials to contact their Western counterparts to express their disinterest in continuing the war in Ukraine.[9] Budanov claimed that some Kremlin officials began advocating for negotiations with Ukraine to their Western counterparts while the Russian military-political command plotted missile strikes to scare Ukrainians into negotiations. Budanov‘s statement is consistent with the influx of Western reports about direct criticism of Putin within the Kremlin less than a week after the annexation announcement around October 6.[10] Wagner Group­–affiliated Telegram channels also noted the emergence of the pro-war and pro-negotiations factions within the Kremlin within the same timeframe.

Day 244 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet yet again, we had no missile strikes and no drones were sent at us. We had a couple of air raid alerts, but they were uneventful, which is a good thing. Russians are not in range to shell Kharkiv anymore, but from the reports of our governor it looks like a lot of the towns in Kharkiv oblast, that are closer to the Russian border, still get shelled daily.

It also looks like Belgorod oblast gets shelled daily too, because Russians are complaining a lot about it. About a week ago we even destroyed an ammo depot, which they had in a *shopping mall.* They were saying that we were aiming at civilians, but then people posted videos with secondary explosions going off in that mall. It seems like they were destroying all of our malls simply because they were projecting their own tactics onto us. 

Now we are also apparently Satanists, according to Russia, which is why now their “special operation” also includes “desatanisation”, whatever that might mean. Do they not understand how stupid this sounds? Who even comes up with this? With how much they are projecting, they are probably the Satanists that they are talking about.

Now, nuke threats will remain just threats but I guess they'll increase as soon as russian army will get obliterated because at that point only those threats will protect russian soil from any attack. Russia will find itself surrounded by enemies and no reliable army to provide actual protection. If they didn't had nukes they would've had been treated like germany in 1945.

Dirty bomb theory is weird. Even the Russians know Russia is losing, so there's just no reason for Ukraine to do that even if they were evil and stupid enough to. Sure the Russians hope the war will turn around, and some still seem to believe they have some super secret tech in the works - but seriously, if your opponent has been winning every round, why would they do cheap shots that damage their own land?

The Russian state TV seems to paint a lot of hope on winter being better for them because the citizens will have to leave due to cold and no power.

""And this, of course, cannot be done without broad and deep coordination between all areas of activity, all structures, all ministries, departments, and of very different orientations and the power bloc, and the economic bloc, and the regions of the Russian Federation.""

""Many times with many of you who are now taking part in this meeting, we discussed issues related to the need, I repeat, to update all our work to improve administrative procedures, many from different angles approached these problems. Well, now the situation is such that life itself pushes us to look at all this work once again in the most careful way and develop common approaches to updating all procedures""

""Let me remind you that by today the Coordination Council should have formed target tasks in certain areas of activity, so far these targets do not exist, but I have no doubt that they will be received in the near future""

""It is necessary to intensify competition, new manufacturers should appear here, efficient and modernly equipped, ready to work in the right, new format and give out the necessary quality of this or that product. This also applies to medicine, it concerns the construction sector in the broadest sense of the word.""

You made a mistake.  Fine.  You realized you were wrong (or, at least, that your constituents disagree with your stated position) and retracted your statement.  Great.  Don’t insult me by treating me as if I’m too stupid to see that you are only pretending to take responsibility for your mistake while actually passing the blame to your staff.

The allies play an integral role in aiding Ukraine’s fight for continued existence, but it is up to Ukraine and Ukraine alone to decide the terms on which they will agree to stop fighting.  I personally hope that is complete withdrawal of russia from all of Ukraine’s 1991 territory, but my opinion, as a non-Ukrainian, is irrelevant.

Super Tucanos are low cost low maintenance military planes designed for low threat environments. 

They meet Western standards and are compatible with most western air weapons systems. 

Would these be a good way to onboard Ukraine to western jets? They are commonly used as trainers by NATO air forces. Further they have machine guns that should enable them to cheaply intercept Shahed Drones. 

They’d obviously need to avoid contested airspace. But for combat air patrol inside Ukraine and Shahed interception duty they seem well suited. They’re also a cheap way to get training time towards western jets while still being militarily useful. What do you guys think?

Before long, Putin will finally take off his skinsuit to reveal... that he has been RASputin all along! After that minor career change of his in 1916 that involved him eating a hearty meal of cyanide laced cake and madeira wine (he complained about the bitter aftertaste to the wide-eyed amazement of Yusopov) before getting shot two times in the chest (which annoyed him, causing him to complain to Yusopov again) and once in the forehead (after which it dawned on him that Yusopov may have something against him), he decided that Russia had done him dirty. His decision was only strengthened when Yusopov's companions started stabbing him, after which he decided it'd be better to just lean back and think of the Tsar in order to let it go over faster. Conveniently, his would-be murderers then allowed him to go for a hearty swim in the icy Malaya Nevka River, which was a good way to calm down his boiling stomach when the cyanide started kicking in for real. 

So he bided his time and patiently worked to keep corrupting Russia from within, ensuring that everyone living in it was going to be caught in a negative feedback loop of misery and suffering for the rest of their lives.

Prigozhin with Wagner has his own private army. One angle is to highlight the threat to Putin that ""powerful"" Prigozhin's army can be used against Putin if the Kremlin is further weakened. Also Prigozhin is himself criticizing the Russian military claiming how Wagner is doing better. Pushing these points that Prigozhin is preparing for for an opportunity to take advantage of weakened Putin makes Putin more paranoid about an army not under his full control and supposedly better than his own military may help Putin move against him out of fear of a Wagner coup thus killing Prigozhin. This would weaken Wagner. Also the message that Prigozhin claims his forces are better than the Russian army makes the MOD military leaders work to weaken Prigozhin since he is trying to scapegoat them to his benefit. Any divisions and tensions between the groups weakens their over all efforts and if lucky cause literal military infighting between groups.

Similarly Kaydrov (sp) has his own Chechen private army as well, same strategy different guy. Putin is paranoid and the more he thinks these two guys have control over military assets makes him that much more likely to move against them. Again weakening Russia's overall effort in Ukraine with internal infighting. Messaging that amplifies the infighting of these groups, and amplifying their messages of an incompetent MOD will help gin up resentment between the military and these groups causing dissention. The more people talk about these two might move against the Kremlin will help make Kremlin leaders more paranoid which is a good thing.

The western governments amplifying this is more effective of course cause that is what they are good at but it doesn't hurt to have people online amplifying this message.

""Dirty Bomb"": Enerhoatom Reports Suspicious Work at Nuclear Power Plant

>Ukrainian power plant operator Enerhoatom has accused Russia of trying to detonate a so-called ""dirty bomb"" using nuclear waste from the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant itself. The Russian military had carried out unauthorized work on storage tanks for spent nuclear fuel over the course of the past week, Enerhoatom said.

>Neither Ukrainian technicians nor observers from the International Atomic Energy Agency were allowed into the area of the plant, it said. Russia is believed to be planning a terrorist attack involving nuclear materials and radioactive waste, Enerhoatom added. There were 174 containers with nuclear fuel elements at the site, it said.

>Over the weekend, Russia had accused Ukraine of planning to use a ""dirty bomb"" that would release radioactivity. Kiev responded by saying that Russia was making such accusations because it was planning such an attack itself.

(Like, \~$2,000 an hour as opposed to \~$5,000 an hour.  A prop plane like the Turcano might be much cheaper.)  

As an interceptor it'd be slow.  Cruising speed of 320 mph, slightly slower than an A-10C cruising speed of 340 mph (according to wikipedia).  Being slow is generally a bad thing if you're using the aircraft as an interceptor, but apparently the Shahed-136 only goes about 115 mph (not much faster than a Cessna 150) so I guess it's more than adequate.

Unlike the A-10, the Turcano has a 2-seat cockpit which would make training a lot easier.

Having followed the events pretty closely since the lead up to hostilities last year, it seems that intelligence gathering and dissemination by allied nations has been exceptional and spot on throughout. 

NATO has been pretty public about consequences that would occur should Russia use a nuclear weapon, though have not pubicly detailed exactly what those consequences would be in detail.

Personaly, I would hope that if intelligence services picked up that Russia was making moves toward employing a nuclear device, I would hope that leadership would not sit back and wait to see a nuclear weapon used and then react to that.  Especially one used against a city.  Russia is the aggressor nation, should it be verified that they are going to use a weapon, it would be justified, if at all possible, to preemptively disrupt that chain of events militarily.  Lines of communication are established between principle leaders, any warnings or concerns can be relayed directly.  I can't see any reason to *signal* anonymously through the media.

Edit:
To date, I think this entire situation has been managed very well by the leadership of allied countries overall, individually and collectively.

 >The Christmas truce (German: Weihnachtsfrieden; French: Trêve de Noël; Dutch: Kerstbestand)  was a series of widespread unofficial ceasefires along the Western Front of the First World War around Christmas 1914. The truce occurred five months after hostilities had begun. Lulls occurred in the fighting as armies ran out of men and munitions and commanders reconsidered their strategies following the stalemate of the Race to the Sea and the indecisive result of the First Battle of Ypres. In the week leading up to 25 December, French, German and British soldiers crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk.

 >Gasification is a process that converts biomass- or fossil fuel-based carbonaceous materials into gases, including as the largest fractions: nitrogen (N2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). This is achieved by reacting the feedstock material at high temperatures (typically >700 °C), without combustion, via controlling the amount of oxygen and/or steam present in the reaction. The resulting gas mixture is called syngas (from synthesis gas) or producer gas and is itself a fuel due to the flammability of the H2 and CO of which the gas is largely composed.

Or is it the condition that any deal is acceptable to the Ukrainian people?

And if it isn’t either one of those conditions outlined by the “progressives” (see below) - negotiation to end the war, approved by Ukraine - then what is your issue?

Do you want America to keep fighting until the last Ukrainian? Or start a nuclear war with Russia?

Of course, it’s possible you never ever read the proposal and are just knee-jerk attacking Democrats because, as I said, that’s really very helpful now in offering a united front to Russian aggression.

I’m inclined to agree that there doesn’t seem to be any reason to signal anything anonymously through the media - unless the very thing you were trying to signal was that you weren’t going to shy away even from semi-public statements leaked to news outlets seen as credible in the Western World, i.e. that you wanted to signal “if push comes to shove, we wouldn’t be afraid to inform the public even of things that you’re now assuming we wouldn’t ever talk about publicly”. I can only guess as to why this is a signal you would want to send - perhaps Russia assumes they can push things a certain amount with actual on-the-ground action and suffer no consequences whatsoever because US intelligence would be the only to see and they wouldn’t release any information because they wouldn’t want to spread panic, and this is the US saying “we’ll telegraph all of your moves publicly, even the nuclear ones you think we’d never talk about”",False,1666736443.0,t3_ycvdcw,t1_itq6v1d,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Political liberals - democratic and represenative government

Economic liberals - free market minimally regulated economics

Social liberals - anti social hierarchy, people regulate their own personal behavior

Before 2016, both American major political parties were politically liberal.

The spectrum for political liberalism is (political liberal - authoritarian).

The Progressive movement arose in the United States in the 1890s-1920s, ideological successor to the People's Party (populist).  Progressives believed that business and the wealthy were hurting people and the government should intervene in the economy to protect them.

The spectrum for economic liberalism is (progressive (left) - economic liberal (right)).

Social liberalism and social conservativism is the willinginess/unwillinginess to accept socially defined hierarchy, socially strict personal behavior codes, and acceptance of social disruption and change.

The spectrum for social liberalism is (socially liberal - socially conservative).

The American political parties are as follows:

Democrats - (politically liberal, economically mildly progressive, socially liberal).

Republicans - (politically authoritarian (since 2016), economically liberal, socially conservative)

British political parties

Labor (politically liberal, economically progressive, socially liberal)

Liberals (politically liberal, economically mildly liberal, socially liberal)

In other words, you can have a negotiated settlement, but the terms need to be in immediate context (so they are either fulfilled or not -- there's no delay) and Ukraine needs to be in a situation where they are ably defended (i.e, put em in NATO). 

Putin or no, there's no situation where a future promise from Russia can be any part of it.

So certainly, you can get an end to the way based on withdrawal, reparations, and more difficult, but return of the kidnapped people. Because all those can occur right now and if they aren't, then you go back to fighting.

This allows both sides to inspect the facilities for nuclear weapon production. It allows for the nuclear warheads to be inspected on new ICBM and SLBMs. Each new ICBM and SLBM that is produced for either side will have the opposite side there upon completion of the new missile and upon the delivery of the location that it will be at.

Russia has completely rebuilt their ICBMs lately, expecting to finish in 2024. They are replacing their warheads with the RS-28 Sarmat. So you are telling me Russia is spending enough to fool US inspections being able to look at each new missile replacement but they decided not to spend enough to make them actually operational? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me.

Rosatom hands the R&D and production, they have a little over 95k people working on their nuclear weapons. Their nuclear modernization isn't entirely part of their military's budget. Much like the US who does a lot of the R&D and production of new weapons outside of the military's budget. Russia keeps the majority of the spending on this top secret. To get a better idea of the spending we do know of the public 10% of Russia's military budget is assigned to nuclear maintenance and modernization. Then we also know the government spending on these ""closed cities"" that Russia uses for nuclear weapon R&D and production. It is estimated by SIPRI that Russia spends a total of 13-14% of their total defense funding (total funding, not just what the MOD gets). SIPRI also estimate that Russia is spending around 10.8 billion on this in total per year while the US is spending around 35 billion per year.

You still need to factor in the lower income in Russia so the people that are doing this would would be earning substantially less than those in the US. So Russia is spending at least 1/3rd of what the US is spending. [Here](https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2018/how-much-does-russia-spend-nuclear-weapons) is a report going over some of this, hopefully you will take it as a source.

So again, I ask... Russia is doing all of this just to fake having them working? Even if they have 20% working, that is enough.",False,1666730709.0,t3_ycvdcw,t1_itrjxcs,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

>I'm from Ukraine too! And Dostoevsky is my favourite author. I'd say accusations of him being orthodox fascist are reasonable, his belief in exclusive role of russian people is hard to accept today. But I still love him as a writer, his style is amazing and breathtaking. Near with ideas similar to fascism there are also ideas of christian morale that can help to become a better person and he addresses many hard and interesting questions of philosophy, religion and politics.

>Switzerland has had a long history of bad conduct when it comes to money. Every time a dictator falls we discover they had billions of dollars held in Swiss banks. And it is not a victimless crime – they usually steal money while killing lots of people in the process. Switzerland is enabling very bad people, including people close to Putin, in their theft. Switzerland always tries to justify that by saying they want to remain neutral. But you can’t remain neutral if you take money from criminals.

* Switzerland's refugee laws, especially with respect to Jews fleeing Germany, were strict and have caused controversy since the end of World War II.
* Refugees were not allowed to hold jobs.
* The maximum number of refugees at any given time in Switzerland was 115,000 (\~3% of the Swiss population)
* 104,000 were foreign troops interned according to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers outlined in the Hague Conventions (PoWs)
* Of the refugees, 60,000 were civilians escaping persecution by the Nazis.
* 27,000 were Jews.
* Between 10,000 and 24,000 Jewish civilian refugees were refused entry and sent back to Germany.

Sorry too good to pass up.  The only one we have workable leverage over is Ukraine, so any ""let's all come to the negotiation table"" when neither country wants to and refuses an outlines or basic tenets for the talks is obviously leaning the most on Ukraine.

&#x200B;

I mean let's break down your latest comment.  You're scared of Putin going nuclear, and so you want a peace.  You've already given Russia all the leverage here.  You don't care that we tried this back in 2014, trying to calm down the Crimea fighting and figure out our way forward.  Putin's response to having that ""out"" was to just take more of Ukraine.  Now, you're wanting the US to use its leverage over Ukraine to give Russia more things because you're scared of Putin's nukes, and think that other aren't.  Here's a newsflash -- at the wargaming table, Putin knows that if he goes nuclear, US forces entering the conflict is almost guaranteed.  So, if he does go nuclear, there's going to be some radioactivity on US soil also; because this shit is going to devolve.

And you're scared of that.  That's understandable.  But where's the line that you draw after this latest nuclear blackmail?  Give him more of Ukraine?  All of it?  Belarus?  Poland?  There's a reason why former soviet bloc countries are even more steadfast and strong in their support of Ukraine than the US is.  It's because they know if it's not stopped here, then it's likely not ever stopped and they're next to fall.

So, coming to the negotiation table and formally giving Russia some of Ukraine really only allows Russia to regroup for the next bite it wants to take.

And that's why this letter is stupid -- no matter what they say in it, the only real workable leverage the US has is over Ukraine, and so ""let's redouble efforts to get to the negotiating table"", regardless of what you \*want\* it to mean, means that the US coerces Ukraine to the table to give some concessions.

It also feeds into Putin's narrative internally where he's been saying that the West will grow tired and start splintering and then stop supporting as much, and then Russia will strike back and make gains again.  It plays directly into his internal narrative -- ""hey, look!  The US government is splintering and they want Ukraine to negotiate!

Of course that causes cognitive dissonance when someone does inevitably bring it up, so people have taken to mocking and deriding any mention of genuine concern as “CoNcErN” and adding the delusional concept that somehow the mere mention of nuclear weapons must always mean that the poster is in cahoots with Russian propaganda, and deriding and ignoring him is not just the convenient thing to do, but in fact is brave and patriotic and somehow means “holding the line and supporting our war effort”.

Alternatively, the line is “there’s nothing we can do about it anyway - so why worry?” - which is much easier and much more convenient, of course, than accepting the fact that constant vigilance and an ear to the ground could mean the difference between life and death for oneself and one’s family.

Or it’s not certain to lead to almost certain death - but then we should be discussing what we could each do now in preparation in order to be among the ones that don’t suffer the most terrible fate.

See [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe#19th_century). Pretty strong hint that it's been working well.

Sure, there were no wars which our neighbors were fighting in or that were on our borders that could've drawn us in, except  

- 1848/49 Italy vs Austria

- 1859, France&Italy vs Austria II

- 1866, Austria vs Prussia

- also 1866, Italy vs Austria III

- 1870-71, France vs Prussia

- 1914-1918, WW1 <--- neighbors lost 4% of their pop, would've been ca. 150,000 people

- 1939-1945, WW2 <--- neighbors lost 1% (France/Italy) -10% (Germany), would've been ca. 45,000-450,000 people. Closer toward the latter if Germany had Anschluss'd us like they did Austria.

The last two wars alone made neutrality 100% worth it, hard to argue against that.
