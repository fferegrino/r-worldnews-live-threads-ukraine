Day 216 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Some quiet time was nice while it lasted, but today they fired a ton of missiles at Kharkiv again. At 9pm they started launching them from Belgorod. There were 3 sudden and very loud explosions, which made our lights flicker for a couple seconds, but the electricity wasn’t cut for us, though in some other districts it was cut, because they hit some critical infrastructure again.

It was reported that they hit Kholodna Hora district, which is about 6-7km away from us. That was just the beginning, after about 2 minutes another 3-4 explosions were heard, this time they were louder than the first time, car alarms were going off with every explosion, and we think it hit somewhere closer to us, but we don’t know what was hit. 

That was also not the end, after another couple of minutes they hit us with the third volley of missiles. This time it was extremely loud, even louder than the last time, and it almost sounded like the missiles were flying overhead, but I’m not sure about it, it might just have been that weird long sound of explosion again.

In total there were about 8-10 explosions basically back to back, we haven’t been hit with so many missiles in a long time. This does say one thing about them; it means that they are losing on the battlefield elsewhere. They absolutely always rain Kharkiv with missiles every time they are losing. This time it’s about the situation around Lyman, which they will most likely lose in the next couple of days, and they don’t like that at all. And their answer to that is to hit some civilian infrastructure far away from the frontline, a genius move indeed.",False,1664325809.0,t3_xp5vwt,t3_xp5vwt,,0,164,0,164,2,0,

- President Putin is scheduled to address both houses of the Russian parliament on Friday 30 September.

- There is a realistic possibility that Putin will use his address to formally announce the accession of the occupied regions of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. The referendums currently underway within these territories are scheduled to conclude on 27 September.

- Russia's leaders almost certainly hope that any accession announcement will be seen as a vindication of the 'special military operation' and will consolidate patriotic support for the conflict. This aspiration will likely be undermined by the increasing domestic awareness of Russia's recent battlefield sets-backs and significant unease about the partial mobilisation announced last week.

WE HAVE A LOT OF ARTILLERY IN YOUR OWN. GUNS, HOWitzers, Mortars.
WE GIVE A SEA OF FIRE.

The only problem is we're not shooting accurately.
Are the gunners to blame? I do not think so. If, as a quiz, you can tell me the latest systems that we use, I will be grateful. Think, and I will tell you:

""Msta"" - 40 years ago
commissioned,
Cannon ""Peony"" - 42 years ago,
Mortar ""Tulip"" - 56 years ago,
D-30 - 60 years ago,
""Rapier"" - 62 years ago,
Mortar 120mm - 63 years ago,
Mortar 82mm - 72 years ago.

My colleagues make a remark to me about the indicated dates. We discuss this point in numbers, but not in essence. The bottom line is that everything is old.

Yes, experts will say: ""Sasha, the West also has old guns, it's all about the new ammunition."" And they will be right. But then why are we shooting with old Soviet ammunition? Why, when disposing of ammunition, we first destroyed new ammunition, but the old ones never reached the hands.

No, we have a new (born in 1986) Krasnopol guided projectile. But it is advisable to use it with laser guidance using the Orlan-30. So there is no Orlan-30. It's so small that it's not. That's why…

Therefore, if I write about artillery reconnaissance and guidance systems, it will be completely vulgar. They know this very well both there ☝️ and there 👇. Don't blame the gunner, he shoots as best he can.

Here is the video I posted above. You can see how our gunners hit enemy strongholds. See how many craters are around in the field? If we had accurate artillery systems, then a hundred times fewer shells would be enough.

Especially in the northern forest-steppe, when Russian lines break, they tend to rupture across a wide area in a large retreat.  Perhaps only wide rivers and reservoirs are the only safer possibilities for stabilizing the lines for many months.

If the Russian lines should massively rupture again, and Military Summary estimates the critical battle will be over the next 2 days, the conventional war is basically over for them.  There won't be any excuses unlike Kharkiv that they have already withdrawn and that there was only a skeleton screening force.  No, this time there are relatively large armored units attempting to blunt this Ukrainian counteroffensive, and presumably whatever Russia has left for its air power and artillery is being thrown into the desperate battle.  If Russia cannot hold the line here, in an area that should be the most receptive to their occupation, they cannot in the long run hold the line anywhere regardless of how many they try to mobilize.

🔥 Some context for this section: Both Nord Stream 1 and 2 were idle. They were pressurized with gas, but were not supplying gas to Europe. The only damage is to the environment as the pressurization gasses escape into the atmosphere. As for motive, it may come down to simple economics to ensure Gazprom doesn’t have to pay penalties for failure to fill their contracts.

🔥 The first video of the leaking Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines show absolutely massive ruptures. Sweden says that its seismic network registered explosions, one of them had a magnitude of 2.3.

🔥 The explosions were conducted outside of territorial waters but within Denmark’s economic zone. The leaks are expected to continue for 🔗 at least a week. The Danish Prime Minister stated that the attack was not an act of war. The CIA had warned Germany weeks ago about possible attacks on the pipelines.

🔥 With the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines russia has moved from hybrid interference to hybrid operations against Europe, a major escalation that falls just short of hybrid warfare. Other hybrid operations were attacks on ammunition plants in Europe which supplied Ukraine.

🔥 Gazprom said that moscow may apply sanctions to Ukraine’s pipeline company, Naftogaz, if it pursues arbitration against Gazprom over non-payment of transit fees. Such a scenario would mean the suspension of russian gas transit through Ukraine’s pipelines.

🔥 Between the Nord Stream breaches and Gazprom’s threats, gas prices in Europe have jumped 20%.

What is a False Dilemma?

This is an Informal Fallacy based on a premise that erroneously limits what options are available. Example: ""Negotiate immediate ceasefire or nuclear war, which one should we pick?"" Clearly there are not the only two alternatives available, but the proposer makes it seem like it is so. The goal is to get ""rational"" people to agree with the proposer's position that an immediate ceasefire is the only ""common sense, sane"" option to support. Often put forth as a ""we"" statement to attempt to build false cohesion and group support. 

What is an Informal Fallacy? Long story short, it has nothing to do with logical consistency.

""Why would Russia blow up it's own pipeline, it doesn't gain anything from this?""

Well ya see little Jimmy, that is actually a decent question, but if we dig in for a few minutes we can find some interesting facts that may point to a reason. First off, Russia has not been using the pipes to deliver gas since [August.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/27/energy/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks/index.html) Well technically NS2 was never used, but I digress. So sabotaging the pipeline is not going to result in lost revenue in the short term. That revenue was not flowing. Two, the nordic countries literally [just opened a pipeline today](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/scandinavian-seismic-stations-register-explosions-near-pipelines-raising-fears-of-sabotage) meant to help provide Europe another source of gas to deal with being cut off from Russia. Third, and finally, [4 Gazprom executives have ended up suicided](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/business/russian-oligarchs-deaths-intl/index.html) in the last 6 months. 

I think the following theories may help explain the facts above. One, Russia realized another gas line was coming that would fuck over their leverage on Europe. They sabotaged their own pipes to try and show they could blow up the new one. They were hoping to scare Europe into stopping support of Ukraine considering the RU forces are getting their cheeks clapped. Putin could have also been worried about a palace coup forming. Those Gazprom folks have good connections to Europe and the Russian government. There was a lot of money to be made from NS2.  I wouln't be shocked if one of the Gazprom people was trying to coup Putin so they could get that money. By blowing up the pipes, Putin has guaranteed there will be no normalization with Europe removing this monetary incentive for a coup.",False,1664325956.0,t3_xp5vwt,t3_xp5vwt,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

Behavior is still changing. **I advise you to prepare for the scenario of the Kharkiv** region. Beware of the environment.

Answer:

Everyone is preparing for this, even though our direction (most likely) is not the most priority for dill. But already two hospitals from those that I knew had already been evacuated closer to the rear. I fully admit that the dill may try to wedge in on the Svetlodarsk direction, with certain inputs it may succeed, then we will have to withdraw the guys from the Soledarsk / Artemovsk direction. And the progress there was rather slow, although not the bloodiest for our baht.

Another thing is that we may not have time to move away from those directions.>>

1. It does not matter who took out Nord Stream. The take home message is that Russia is an unreliable trading partner.

One of the two pipes remains intact. Trying to figure out if that's intentional.

>Swedish seismologist Bjorn Lund told local media it appeared an explosion had taken place at the Nord Stream pipelines. “At least 100kg of TNT has been used, but probably more,” he said.

If one pipe was intentionally spared, then that could speak to a motivation - for instance it would leave something for Russia to blackmail Europe with, as they've been attempting to do. But if the pipes are literally side-by-side, and with explosions that large, it doesn't seem like a safe bet that you'll get one and not the other.

I'm still leaning toward Russia itself doing it (largely due to the CIA warning), but I wouldn't completely rule out some other power just taking the strategic decision into their own hands to take that blackmail card off the table once and for all. Russia was trying to use it as a playing card, causing parts of Europe (ahem Germany) to wring their hands and possibly slow support to Ukraine. It puts an immediate end to all the consternation about the consequences of abandoning Russian gas completely, and simply forces it as a reality, and shuts down that entire conversation. 

Knowing whether the sparing of the remaining pipe was intentional or luck would sway my suspicions, I think. I think if that single pipe was left intact on purpose, that definitely plays into Russia's hands as it leaves them that small playing card (and can be reactivated quickly if this comes to an end). That's why I'm wondering if it's even possible to do that safely, if the pipelines are literally side by side, or if it's just a fluke that the one survived. In any case, if leaving one intact was intentional, then that speaks to a slightly different motivation than destroying all of them - whatever that motivation is. 

One more thing - even though the CIA purportedly warned about this happening, it could *still* have been another actor who may have even had that intel and decided to beat Russia to the punch, to send their own message. Imagine being Putin, who puts into motion a *contingency* plan to destroy the pipelines at a certain time to send a message... but then they go boom before he has his plan in place. That would be a mindfuck.

And if keeping one pipeline open was intentional, then that's sending a message to him as well. 'Sorry you lost those pipelines. You have this one pipeline left. Shame if anything happened to it.'

Or shooting the hostage before he can do it to make his own point to show how serious he is, lol.

Once again, Russia has made explicit statements about the use of nuclear weapons. After President Putin last week, former President Medvedev is now also emphasizing that the nuclear threats are ""not a bluff"". In a message to Telegram, the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council says that Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons if necessary.

Russia's nuclear doctrine allows the country to resort to nuclear weapons if it faces an ""existential threat"". Medvedev says he does not believe that NATO will intervene in the conflict in such a case. ""The security of Washington, London and Brussels is far more important to NATO than the fate of Ukraine,"" he said.

I'm pretty sure this is the most probable scenario the US has been preparing for. 

https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2022/09/27/russia-putin-tactical-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-robert-baer-ovn-intl-hnk-vpx.cnn

In hindsight, these referenda will be seen as a confirmation of that. If things remained as they are, russia would end up losing the entirety of the occupied regions, they cannot beat conventionally the Ukrainian forces backed by the West. So they have to annex the remaining territory very quickly, before they lose further ground, so that they can justify a nuclear attack once those regions start being taken back by Ukraine.

I simply don't see the russians doing all of this, referenda followed by annexation, only to lose the annexed regions to the Ukrainian forces the next months, then packing up and leaving in defeat. That would be worse than not annexing and retreating (they would be losing ""russian territory"" now).

So, at this point, what determines whether we move on to a full-scale nuclear war or not is what the kremlin's reaction will be to NATO's response to the first nuclear attack. I'm betting that there won't be a further nuclear escalation, that NATO intervenes directly but conventionally in Ukraine, that russia loses on the ground to NATO troops and retreats in full. Losing to NATO instead of the Ukrainian army, while simultaneously having been one of the only two nations to have used nuclear weapons, will allow the kremlin some face-saving (other nations will still ""fear"" russia because they see their willingness to use nuclear weapons ""without hesitation"").

But I'm betting on this simply because I cannot afford the other option, a second nuclear strike in Ukraine, this time on NATO troops, as retaliation by the russians to NATO's direct involvement. That would lead to a full-scale nuclear war and everything that ensues. I think people are not taking the current tipping point seriously enough.

Russia hopes that things will become so unbearable that people will rise up and protest and force governments to find peace at the expense of supporting Ukraine.

During the 90s we (NATO nations) feared that a Russia would go unstable and a madman would get access to their nuclear arsenal. This is the plot of some movies of the time like ""Red Tide"" Personally I do not see us just saying ""Welp there is no way for us to stopped a massed attack so lets just hope it never happens."" I personally think (This is just a gut feeling. There is obviously no evidence) we have had the absolute ability to not only stop some but all forms of attack atleast against weapons that have to gain lots of altitude before they have enough energy to coast to their targets. Maybe this is a laser network. Railguns, EM systems that can burn through even protected warheads and fry their arming systems, who knows. But I think we have it and I think it is time we announce we have it and make it clear that any use of a WMD anywhere on the planet will result in a full response. Not MAD. We stop all inbounds but their defense network would be unable to stop ours. 

Once everyone knows Russia's nukes are useless. Putin would be removed from power in a day. The few that are willing to fight believe their daddy Putin will ""Surely soon start dropping nukes on em!"" once that is not possible they KNOW they are going to be defeated.

If such a system does not exist. Then it does not exist. But if it does exist. I think the benefits of announcing it outweigh the drawbacks (Such as global tension of the being the only remaining effective nuclear power because we can stop all the others at the push of a button and that everyone and their grandmother will start developing a counter to it forcing us to to spend billions improving it) Because it is starting to sound like even Putin might be listening to his own bullshit. The dumb cold war era battle plan of using 3-4 tactical nukes to blow open a hole in the line and blast through it before the enemy can respond while saying ""If you respond in kind we launch ICBMs"" It could not have worked back then and that was with the FAR better trained and equipped soviet forces. But he may be thinking he is some kind of ultra super quarterback and SURELY this time he would throw a perfect hail mary pass across the entire field for the game winning touchdown. If so now is the time to tell him that the football would deflate and fall to the ground before he can throw it.

In one instance the soldiers—both conscripted and paid—listed over 3000 warships, up to 1.15 million infantry, 50,000 cavalry, 5000 artillery, and more.

A Russian loss here means they lost what is effectively a pitched battle with their best remaining stuff against Ukraine. Fair and square. Something that hasn’t truly happened yet on any large scale(Kyiv was a withdrawal, Kherson was choked out from supplies, Kharkiv was an understaffed skeleton front). And as you’ve said, that means the end of any holdings in Ukraine for them, even Crimea would be in trouble.

A victory for Russia here isn’t gonna turn the tide, but it at least suggests Crimea and Luhansk MIGHT be up in the table since Russia could just jam pack the small amount of remaining territories with everything they have.(Even with all their problems, a far smaller front and territory like that would not be hard to defend).",False,1664256978.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq2htal,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Scroll down to ""Age Structure""

Ideally you'd want lots of kids and young people in your population to replace older people, to work, pay taxes, fix things. Russia seems to have a weird bulge in the 35-39 range. There are way less under that age, which points to a low birth rate for over 30 years.

Another interesting thing is how the male population goes down so hard above age 40, which is not matched by the female population. Some combination of things is killing Russian men early, cutting 20-30 years of productivity.

So, yeah, they weren't in a good spot before, and the mix of throwing men against Ukrainian artillery and other men fleeing the draft is just going to make it worse.

Weirdly, I think this was part of the reason for the war in the first place.

Putin has no clear motive for war other than territorial expansion. Russia hasn’t been attacked in any way. Putin just wants to rebuild the USSR that crumbled in 1991.

Russia: this takes away the only leverage they have on Europa. The threat to hit other European pipes is not convincing either, because it could only be taken as an act of war and bring NATO in war with Russia. No winning scenario.  
USA: they are definitely not above doing things like that. But this one is just too dangerous, if discovered it would backfire catastrophically likely disintegrating the alliance and resulting in victory for Russia.

9972a2e80e8ea4e2368d15b2a5ad1c6c,xp5vwt,iq5bpks,"I suggest everyone curious goes straight to the Institute of Atomic Scientists. They are generally not that optimistic about the AEGIS system's ICBM interception capabilities, but do feel strongly that the USA's first-strike capability has far exceeded Russia's since at least the mid 2010s, effectively upsetting the balance of MAD. 

Reading what the institute says, interception systems in a real hot war are essentially redundant because Russia will be a lake of fire from border to border before their subs have launched. The Russian nuclear threat the IAS is concerned about is that Russia will trigger a false retaliatory strike and land a limited number of nukes on US soil because of a false-positive in their detection system, which only provides half the warning time the US' does and which has failed before. 

This bulletin is eye opening:
https://thebulletin.org/2017/03/how-us-nuclear-force-modernization-is-undermining-strategic-stability-the-burst-height-compensating-super-fuze/

Consider how much of the Russian sub fleet is getting tailed by a hunter killer at all times (and how they only have one, literally one Typhoon-class SSBN capable of even going to sea), and that it is not possible to kick off a nationwide silo-launch instantly, and it looks like a Russia-US nuclear ""exchange"" would be pretty lopsided. 

To be clear, the bulletin estimates that wiping the *entire* Russian silo arsenal with *only* the US SSBN fleet would use *less than a third* of the US' ballistic missile warheads. And that is from 2017. 

The IAS is concerned that the US' first strike capability is so good, and the Russian early warning system is so bad, that now that AEGIS is rolling out in Europe Russia will be more likely to hit the big red button if/when their first strike detection system fails (again). 

>Under the veil of an otherwise-legitimate warhead life-extension program, the **US military has quietly engaged in a vast expansion of the killing power of the most numerous warhead** in the US nuclear arsenal

>The result of this fuzing scheme is a significant increase in the probability that a warhead will explode close enough to destroy the target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead system has itself not improved.

>As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do.

>**This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has largely been concealed from the general public**, has serious implications for strategic stability and perceptions 

> Since only part of the W76 force would be needed to eliminate Russia’s silo-based ICBMs, the **United States will be left with an enormous number of higher-yield warheads that would then be available to be reprogrammed** for other missions.

>In all, **the entire Russian silo-based forces could potentially be destroyed while leaving the US with 79 percent of its ballistic missile warheads unused.**

Someone is going to bring up ""but most of the Russian arsenal is on trucks and subs"" and that is specifically covered in the article, via the rest of the inventory. 

>. To destroy or expose the remaining launchers, United States planners would have the nuclear forces needed to undertake truly scorched-earth tactics: Just 125 US Minuteman III warheads could set fire to some 8,000 square miles of forest area where the road-mobile missiles are most likely to be deployed. This would be the equivalent of a circular area with a diameter of 100 miles.

>Such an attack would be potentially aimed at destroying all road-mobile launchers either as they disperse or after they have taken up position some short distance from roads that give them access to forested areas.

>Many of the nearly 300 remaining deployed W76 warheads could be used to attack all command posts associated with Russian ICBMs.

And just to reiterate, any mention of W76 warheads is referring *only* to the sub fleet. This article doesn't even bring up the USAF's arsenal. That's an entire arm of the nuclear triad. The minuteman ICBMs are currently being modernized with similar superfuzes and the next generation ICBM is built around it. The US happily signed the START treaty and stopped building MIRVs because the next generation of nuclear weapons systems are too precise to even need a MIRV. 

In a nuclear war the USA gets 30 minutes from the first detected launch to execute its response. Putin knows that any use of nuclear weapons that threatens the territorial integrity, the civic safety of the United States, could represent the *absolute eradication of life* in Russia. The real threat we need to be worried about is what it would mean for the world order of the future if Russia introduces the use of tactical nuclear weapons to war, and the world witnesses the resulting NATO response. And the threat of Russia inadvertently executing a limited, unplanned first strike on the US because they believe they are retaliating from a falsely detected first strike from us.",1664313934.0,1664309096.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq582ao,,1,22,0,22,1,0,{'gid_3': 1}

Myths aside, the problem with the ""prove yourself crazy to scare enemies into compliance"" gambit is that, if your enemies *truly* convince themselves that you are crazy, they are at least as likely to decide that it's pointless to compromise or deal with you and annihilate you asap, damn the consequences, because you are going to fly off the handle sooner or later anyway and so you might as well get dealt with immediately (especially if you are already in a comparatively disadvantageous position).",False,1664306028.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq51w5w,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

Perhaps.  But NATO would also have other conventional options, including striking Russian assets outside the territories of both Ukraine and Russia itself (such as their navy).  Even if NATO enters the Ukrainian war, they might do so without boots on ground: eg aircraft from bases in NATO countries and/or carriers could provide aerial support to Ukrainian troops.

I also think the military response will somewhat be determined by the wider reaction around the world to such nuclear strike, including that from the likes of China and India.  If they abhor Russia's use of nuclear weapons as much as I expect, Russia will be completely frozen out of all trade.

> But I'm betting on this simply because I cannot afford the other option, a second nuclear strike in Ukraine, this time on NATO troops, as retaliation by the russians to NATO's direct involvement. That would lead to a full-scale nuclear war and everything that ensues.

Even if NATO have boots on the ground in Ukraine who suffer a second nuclear strike by Russia, I think it likely that any response would again be non-nuclear (nuclear launch by the West is only likely if nuclear missiles are launched towards NATO territory).",1664292343.0,1664292104.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq3zay2,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Tactical nukes are *designed* to be used on the battlefield, so the proximity of their own forces wouldn’t deter Russia from using them if Putin made the foolhardy decision to go nuclear.

Kyiv seems unlikely given the significance of the city to Russian ultranationalists and the fact that hitting such a massive population center would bring tremendous backlash.

They’re both members of the European Union, which has its own mutual defense clause. That clause is more ambiguous than Article V—arguably weaker—and completely untested, but it still comes with the risk of going to war with almost the entirety of Europe.

Ukraine is also much more important to Putin and his ilk for nationalist reasons, given it formed a core piece of both the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire. Kyiv holds an important place in the minds of Russian ultranationalists as the birthplace of their culture. Then there are the economic incentives: new natural gas reserves, extremely fertile farmland and increased control of the global food supply, more ports on the Black Sea, and tens of millions more people to bolster Russia’s faltering demographics.

Ukraine isn’t a member of any alliances, so invading would’ve seemed a much safer bet than going after Finland or Sweden.

I'm gonna take this moment to ask a simple question. Everyone realizes the US has many many more options than do nothing and blow shit up right? Like we have the biggest consumer economy in the world, if we wanna push your shit in there is a whole plethora of butt pokers to choose from.

Edit: Also gona correct some of the other ""facts"" in your post.  
The Polish defense minister didn't say shit, if anything Błaszczak has been quiet af making sure he knows as much as possible before saying shit. The FORMER polish defense minister (Sikorski) has blamed the US. Also, the dude did not outright accuse the US of anything. [He simply said thank you USA](https://twitter.com/radeksikorski?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and then tweeted about how Russia's blackmail with nordstream was useless anyways. 

Finally, yes the CIA fucking warned Germany back in mid-summer that this could happen. That's because the CIA has been very open about what our Intel has been saying since before the war started. You do realize that the CIA also fucking warned EVERYONE that Russia was going to invade starting around December of last year. Despite what fucking dumb tankies say, the CIA does occasionally do good things. One of those good things is sharing intel with our allies so they trust our word and judgement going forward.

Impossible to tell without detailed knowledge of the Ukrainian positions and the nuclear weapons available to Putin.

Whether the Ukrainians will continue fighting after a strike depends on how the rest of the world responds I wager. If they see anyone else coming in to save them in response they will continue, if they don't they might not.

>Under the veil of an otherwise-legitimate warhead life-extension program, the **US military has quietly engaged in a vast expansion of the killing power of the most numerous warhead** in the US nuclear arsenal

>The result of this fuzing scheme is a significant increase in the probability that a warhead will explode close enough to destroy the target even though the accuracy of the missile-warhead system has itself not improved.

>As a consequence, the US submarine force today is much more capable than it was previously against hardened targets such as Russian ICBM silos. A decade ago, only about 20 percent of US submarine warheads had hard-target kill capability; today they all do.

>**This vast increase in US nuclear targeting capability, which has largely been concealed from the general public**, has serious implications for strategic stability and perceptions 

>	Since only part of the W76 force would be needed to eliminate Russia’s silo-based ICBMs, the **United States will be left with an enormous number of higher-yield warheads that would then be available to be reprogrammed** for other missions.

>In all, **the entire Russian silo-based forces could potentially be destroyed while leaving the US with 79 percent of its ballistic missile warheads unused.**

>. To destroy or expose the remaining launchers, **United States planners would have the nuclear forces needed to undertake truly scorched-earth tactics:** Just 125 US Minuteman III warheads could set fire to some 8,000 square miles of forest area where the road-mobile missiles are most likely to be deployed. This would be the equivalent of a circular area with a diameter of 100 miles.

>Such an attack would be potentially aimed at destroying all road-mobile launchers either as they disperse or after they have taken up position some short distance from roads that give them access to forested areas.

>	Many of the **nearly 300 remaining deployed W76 warheads** could be used to attack all command posts associated with Russian ICBMs.

Any NATO or European partner that would unilaterally blow up these pipelines would cause a major diplomatic incident and create an enormous breach of trust inside the NATO and EU. The risk of such a thing becoming known and the impact it would generate for the responsible country, would far outweigh any benefit they might derive from this.

Additionally, for Russia such an attack may have several advantages. It firstly creates more fear and instability, as European critical infrastructure has been sabotaged. This plays into their desired image of being willing to ""cross lines"" that no-one would have thought they would cross. It also serves as a ""shot across the bow"", as the sabotage coincides with the opening of a new pipeline from the Nordics to Europe. The message being: next time it will be other pipelines, and you will have a very cold winter.

Lastly, it serves to further isolate Russia. If there are political factions inside of Russia that thought to resume normal trade with Europe by removing Putin, they will have a problem now. This further paints the picture of: Russia against the world.

So no I don't see CIA divers planting charges on a pipeline... but sending over intel that Putin plans to make a blackmail statement by attacking a pipeline to NATO allies could set things into motion on its own. What if the intel the CIA had was that Putin was only going to disable Nord Stream 1 as a contingency plan to scare Europe into the possibility of losing cheap Russian energy?

And then some NATO country (or anyone, really) gets that intel and says: fuck it, we'll take both those chess pieces off the table. Let's take out both Nord 1 and 2. 

Just saying. I'm very ambivalent about who did this. I buy that Russia would do it, but it feels like it would be a contingency thing to me, and not a card played at this moment. Russia's been using it as a blackmail card, saying Europe will freeze without this gas, and could have kept doing so as the days grow colder, so suiciding them just as jacket weather occurs feels like burning a bridge before the enemy has even advanced. 

I really am digging the idea that someone else took them off the table before Russia could continue to threaten to do so. Dunno who. But I'd do it. Other countries may not be at direct war with Russia, but this is international waters, the ramifications are complex, and Russia is highly suspected of cutting undersea cables and whatnot with impunity.

China muscling in on this war would be high risk low reward. It would be a sign of impatience and almost panic, that Beijing does not feel secure in itself, and needs parts of  Russia in its orbit NOW, rather than winning by default in a decade's time when Russia implodes.

To me, if Beijing goes in on this, it says that something is wrong behind the scenes such as the pending economic slow down, and in my opinion it would be a big mistake that would only make their issues worse by risking the deaths of young Chinese adults who in other circumstances would be expected to stay behind and care for the top heavy older Chinese demographic.

It's the same reason why I think the invasion of Taiwan got pushed back.
The two  main things the PRC does not need right now, are debts being called in, and dead Han Chinese. 
Especially if they lose, and to my knowledge the Liberation Army has not seen full combat this side of the millennium, it will topple the current version of the Politburo.

Really the one child policy screwed them, because there are high rates of elders needing care and to be allowed to retire, thus burdening the social welfare net, very few kids in the family to look after them, and the family's chosen son dying leaves the parents with nothing as well as risking the end of the family bloodline.

It will also push the Chinese birth rate below replacement level, especially if young Xian is lying dead in a field somewhere.

One Child is one of the few big mistakes that I've seen them make, along with the madness of the Cultural Revolution, and the time Mao caused a plague of locusts.

 >Soviet submarine S-363 was a Soviet Navy Whiskey-class submarine of the Baltic Fleet, which became notable under the designation U137 when it ran aground on 27 October 1981 on the south coast of Sweden, approximately 10 km (6. 2 mi) from Karlskrona, one of the largest Swedish naval bases. U137 was the unofficial Swedish name for the vessel, as the Soviets considered names of most of their submarines to be classified at the time and did not disclose them. The ensuing international incident is often referred to as the Whiskey on the rocks incident.

I'm not ruling out a bomb delivered *via* the pipeline itself.

Of course, they're are other potential causes, as well.

(As opposed to a fast burn - an example of the difference would be 'gunpowder'.  Chemically, gunpowder goes through a fast burn when it is ignited whereas the fuel/air mixture in the cylinders of your car actually detonates.)

There are a significant number, albeit improbable, of chemical reactions that could have led to the explosion either through negligence or with intent.  With that in mind I think that we will have to exercise patience on this one.

 >A numbers station is a shortwave radio station characterized by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which are believed to be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift keying and frequency-shift keying, as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, other stations appear to have no discernible pattern and broadcast at unpredictable times. Stations may or may not have set frequencies in the high frequency band.

Sure, but so would throwing a nuke at Ukraine be, and they are *saying* that's what they are prepared to do as well.

Their point is: ""You have comfortable lives that you will not be willing to risk, so we will escalate to the point where you will be afraid"". 

Also, attribution is definitely an issue here. If Russia has plausible deniability for any attack - then invoking article 5 becomes pretty difficult for example.

So, if they just have 2nd and 3rd lines of trenches, behind the Main Line of Resistance, with folks with AKs and Machine Guns, they can lay down enough fire to drive away the infantry support, which will drive away the tanks.

Here's the Hollywood interpretation of the events that led to soldier Audie Murphy being awarded the Congresional Medal of Honor in WWII.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgD02qeQ-qo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgD02qeQ-qo)   Note, how Murphy stops a German attack with just a machine gun when the Germans have tanks.

(Obviously a recreation but pretty close to what his Medal citation says, especially since it's based off the book To Hell and Back by Audie Murphy, and stars, Audie Murphy as soldier Audie Murphy.  Murphy did have it toned down for the movies.)

So, to stop a Ukrainian breakthrough, they don't have to stop the heavy weapons, just the infantry.  Then the tanks will withdraw.  Because the Ukrainians aren't foolish enough to advance thier tanks without infantry support like the Russians did.

To stop the infantry, all they need are (1) warm bodies; (2) trenches; (3) AKs; (4) machine guns; and (5) people to radio for artillery support.

Then the Ukrainians will form up and have to attack the second or third line as a new Main Line of Resistance.  It'll slow the Ukrainians down by months.  It'll cost Russia maybe an extra 150,000 - 200,000 deaths to do it.",False,1664322189.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq6507v,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

\- The US supplied Ukraine with underwater drones with undisclosed 'capabilities' near the beginning of the war

\- One of the drones washed up on a beach recently and was destroyed by explosion at sea by Russian officials, indicating that there were probably explosives inside. Design of the drone is consistent with US design and manufacture and Ukraine isn't known to have this capability

\- Russia moved their submarines away from Crimea when the drone was found, which is consistent with concern over this technology specifically, since Ukraine doesn't have much of a submarine fleet or really any underwater capability at all beyond these US drones

\- Russia's submarine response indicates that the drone can dive underwater and may be a threat to submarines, or even was developed as a specific counter to submarines, which is consistent with US naval strategy. Submarines are a favored tool of US competitors because they're relatively cheap and hard to target, and can be a threat to carrier groups. US navy probably developed an even cheaper countermeasure to blow up enemy subs

\- Destruction of underwater gap pipeline is consistent with use of anti-submarine US kamikaze drones, which would imply that Ukraine destroyed the pipeline, possibly with permission from the US, as a geopolitical decision",False,1664286591.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq3lohg,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

A nuclear war in which the US glassed Russia with its present day arsenal, even after a partial strike by Russia, would not be remotely close to the “worst-case scenario” computed about a complete international exchange during the Cold War near the height of nuclear warhead proliferation.

 >The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), derisively nicknamed the ""Star Wars program"", was a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles). The concept was announced on March 23, 1983, by President Ronald Reagan, a vocal critic of the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD), which he described as a ""suicide pact"". Reagan called upon American scientists and engineers to develop a system that would render nuclear weapons obsolete.

Do you know when they will use a nuke? When invading tanks will start being in plain sight from Kremlin. They'll go all out then. Until that day they might as well not have nukes, that's how much their talk is worth.

Zelensky has a vetted interest in pumping up the idea Putin is a mad man on the loose, which he isn't half wrong, because Zelensky needs as much support for Ukraine and as many people upset on Ruzzia as possible. He's a politician, not a truth speaker.

Now, I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of Putin or Ruzzia, but they have more to lose if they use a nuke than they would gain if they use one.

What will they gain if they use a nuke in Ukraine? Kill a few troops, destroy some assets? Sure, but the problem is Ukraine isn't keeping their troops and assets in large numbers in the same place. We are not talking about Ruzzian ammo dumps level of troop concentrations here.

So, he'd have to use a lot of nukes in Ukraine if he wants to make a difference and destroy as many Ukrainian troops and assets as possible.

Now, I don't want to point that Ukraine is rather close to Ruzzia, geographically speaking, and that Moskow and St Petersburgh and a few other major Ruzzian cities are also rather close to the Ukrainian border. Using too many nukes would men a lot of the fallout will inevitably find its way across Ruzzia. They don't want that.

But, as soon as one nuke is used, say for demonstration purposes, not to gain any significant advantage, just to rattle Ukraine and put a stop to its advances due to the shock, Ruzzia will be in a sea of pain. We are talking retaliation from the west, from the US, from NATO, and likely other actors.

You simply can't allow the idea that nukes can be used in a war where you are the aggressor. If you allow that to happen, why wouldn't other nuclear actors decide why not, why not use a nuke here and there? You have to be decisive. This is the current thinking in the west and the west related factions.

Second, even if Putin gives the order to launch a nuke, whose to say it will be followed?

The Soviet Union is famous for having ordered two strikes against the US and those orders were never followed. One of the men that refused to follow the order is famous world wide today, though that fame didn't make him a rich man, ha ha.

Personally, I think that if Putiin gives the order to launch a nuke he will die that day. Not from a retaliatory strike, but by the hands of his people. The people around him want to live as well. Sure, he might be thinning he has nothing to lose, but the people around him might think differently.

It's also important to consider that today is not 1938. We live in a world that is connected, information flows. Ruzzian people have tasted what the west has to offer, and they want more of it. At the end of the day they will chant ""Death to the EU, death to the US"" but they will go and buy a burger and wash it down with a Coke after the protest is over.",False,1664307492.0,t3_xp5vwt,t1_iq528g1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
