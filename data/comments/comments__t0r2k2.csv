Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It’s a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON’T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON’T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

We are asking for support from the government of Brazil, which can help us,” Marlon Santos, who plays for Shakhtar Donetsk, said in a video, speaking alongside 11 other Brazilian footballers and their families.Shakhtar Donetsk is one of Ukraine's most popular and successful soccer clubs, becoming the first club in independent Ukraine to the Europe-wide UEFA Cup in 2009. In recent years, it has been forced to relocate away from the city of Donetsk. Last season it played in Kiev.A spokesperson from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Leonardo Gorgulho, said on Thursday that the government does not currently have a means to safely rescue the estimated 500 Brazilians living in Ukraine. “The evacuation will be carried out as soon as we have security conditions,” Gorgulho said.Bolsonaro, VP, dispute how to refer to the war: Meanwhile, President Bolsonaro, who visited his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin last week, was at odds with his own vice president on Thursday over how to refer to the war in Ukraine.During a live broadcast on his social media, Bolsonaro refrained from calling the situation in Ukraine a war or an invasion and said he will meet with his ministers “so that we can have a dimension of what is happening and Brazil will have its position (on the issue).”However, earlier on Thursday, Vice President Hamilton Mourão condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and called for actions beyond economic sanctions on Putin’s government.“Brazil is not neutral. Brazil does not agree with an invasion of Ukrainian territory,” he said.Bolsonaro, on his Facebook live, however, said that Brazil’s official position on the matter was up to him as President, not to Mourão.A news release from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry on Thursday also refrained from describing the situation in Ukraine an invasion or a war. The ministry called for an “immediate suspension of hostilities and the beginning of negotiations.”

Will forget his misfortune?

Our Cossack glory

Is not written down on paper,

These forests, groves and ravines

It is lulled. (2x)

If you think about it, the Intelligence was probably based on Russia being able to take that Airport, and bridgehead from there into the City while the Eastern force moved in, which would be a five hour drive between Sumy and Kyiv.

That places the air strikes to happen in the darkness, 3AM, and by the time 8AM rolls in, the ground forces from the East are at the ""gates"" facing a softened capital.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

•Further, up to 10,000 more paratroopers will arrive in the capital by Il-76 aircraft along with light armored vehicles.

•One of the tasks is to seize the Ukrainian government and, through blackmail, force them to sign agreements on Russia's terms.

•Even if the authorities have time to evacuate, one of the pro-Russian political puppets will head the government, arguing this with the flight of the previous leadership.

The good news is democracies tend to be better at war than autocracies because the diversity and freedom of thought leads to better planning and risk assessment.

Autocracies always suffer from their leadership being stuck in a bubble of bad information that people are too scared to break.

Of course the problem with democracies is that the decision making process is not as quick or streamlined because it is more of a collaborative process...but this collaboration tends to produce decisions that are good enough to make up for this deficiency.",1645754113.0,1645753530.0,t3_t0r2k2,t3_t0r2k2,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Сейчас сумасшедшие времена, и если вы сейчас находитесь в России, то, скорее всего, испытываете сильные чувства по поводу сложившейся ситуации. Я от всего сердца сочувствую вам.

Учитывая действия и заявления Путина, я с тяжелым сердцем говорю, что вам, возможно, следует быть очень осторожными. Если он решит пойти по пути полного фашистского диктатора, ваши сообщения в социальных сетях могут сделать вас уязвимыми для репрессий со стороны его правительства и его правоохранительных органов - или даже сограждан, купившихся на пропаганду.

Пожалуйста, подумайте о том, чтобы сделать следующее:

Очистите свой аккаунт на Reddit от личной идентифицирующей информации. Это включает ваше имя, если в каком-либо сообщении отмечается или упоминается ваш день рождения, фотографии вас, вашей семьи или домашних животных, а также все остальное, что может быть отслежено до вас.

Всегда подключайтесь к Reddit через VPN.

Рассмотрите возможность удаления критических сообщений из русскоязычных социальных сетей.

Если вы получили образование на Западе, скорее всего, вас будут считать подозрительным... особенно если дела пойдут не так, как хочет Путин. Подумайте о том, чтобы уехать скорее раньше, чем позже. Возможно, вам стоит попросить убежища в одной из европейских стран.

Оставайтесь в безопасности. Вы все являетесь жертвами в той же степени, что и Украина. Не несите это бремя в одиночку, и если люди за пределами России могут как-то помочь вам, пожалуйста, оставьте здесь свой комментарий, чтобы мы могли вместе посмотреть, сможем ли мы предоставить вам голос или ресурсы, необходимые вам, чтобы иметь наилучшие шансы пережить эту бурю невредимыми.

What is a panic attack: when you feel threatened, your body increases the amount of adrenaline in your blood stream.  This increases your physical strength and reaction speed.  Your body also begins pumping oxygen to your muscles and away from less essential parts of your body, such as the parts of your brain used for higher reasoning.  To help this your heart rate goes up and the speed of your breathing increases as your body saturated your blood with oxygen.  This is a panic attack.

How to deal with a panic attack (assuming you aren’t fighting or running for your life and in need of the boost):
1) unplug from whatever is terrifying you if you can safely do so.  Give yourself space to chill out.
2) control your breathing.  If your body cannot get enough oxygen it will start shutting the panic down.  This is why some people deal with it by breathing into a paper bag 
3) practice mindfulness.  You cannot control these feelings, but you can control your reaction.  In this state you will have trouble thinking logically.  You may make mistakes.  It takes a while for your body to come out of that state.  Sit there in the feelings, let them wash through you, abd wait for the panic to pass.
4) do not make any major decisions.  Not unless you have to.  You aren’t thinking straight.  If what you need is to logic your way through something, under these conditions you may struggle and make your problems worse.
5) when you are calm enough to do so, try to get your mind into something else that soothes you.  Take care of yourself.  Be kind to yourself.",1645753620.0,1645753400.0,t3_t0r2k2,t3_t0r2k2,,0,23,0,23,1,0,

Think about it for just a second. That's all you need to do. Think rationally. There are several non-NATO states in the region that Putin can take over. Explain to me: why, when there are MANY non-NATO countries from the former USSR to take over, would Putin attack... A BIG NATO COUNTRY THAT IS REINFORCED BY EVERY OTHER NATO COUNTRY?

Putin is not an idiot. Stretching into a NATO country would not be an imminent ambition for him. Not in the short-to-mid-term. That's without saying, of course, that putting a worn-down military up against Poland immediately would be suicidal. Hell, they probably wouldn't even be able to win that battle using conventional warfare against solely Poland's troops without calling up reserves. Putin knows this, his advisors know this.

There are any number of plausible reasons why he would station troops there. It could be a total coincidence that it's close to Poland. Perhaps he wanted to deploy troops in a strategic position for a pincer on Lviv, which is actually pretty likely seeing as it's close by. Or perhaps he does want to ward off any support coming from Poland. But I can categorically say to everybody: no, no reasonable person believes he is trying to take on Poland and by extension NATO.

So please: stop getting your panties in a twist about things like this. Literally ALL it does is stress people out. I've seen multiple people say they're panicking over seeing others play up that news.

inb4 'Putin is clinically insane so who knows what he might do': no, his moves so far have been very calculated and methodical.

inb4 'Idk, watch his speech from the other day, he wants to take back countries like Poland': doesn't contradict anything I said. Taking on NATO is not a short-term option for him without destroying every single gain he has made, including in this massive advance on the Ukraine, which in case you missed it, he's really set on doing.

inb4 'People said the same thing that he wouldn't invade Ukraine and look where we ended up': the Ukraine invasion was very much an opinion thing, but most analysts thought it was gonna happen. No invasion of a NATO country isn't opinion. Or if it is, only borderline. NOBODY with any credibility is suggesting it.

The Sumi area is still contested by the Russian border so they have bypassed it to go West on the highway to pressure Kiev. They have made huge progress after bypassing Sumi and down are dozens of KM down the road from Sumi. That will put pressure on Ukranians defending Chernihiv as this will pressure those defenders from behind. Russian forces pushing into Chernihiv north of Kiev were checked and bypassed it going South only 45 km from Kiev. Now with the push from Sumi, we could see them reaching Kiev tomorrow.

If the US was doing this if one soldier took fire from a building that building would be leveled with JDAM. I'm calling it here we won't see as many as civilians casualties like how the US fights wars. 

I don't see the lack of advance in the east being Ukrainian strategic victory. Those forces are tied down just how the Russians want them look at the advance to Kyiv to be the main obj. Luckily we are not seeing lots of civilian casualties.  

But this can be a war unseen since WW2 depending on how Ukrainian forces fight and entrench themselves. Take up and fight in the city and evacuate citizens or hide among civilians for bad PR which is horrible.

Former British Army Officer here, I'd be appreciative if any former or current serving military personnel could give their tips on survival for our Ukrainian brothers and sisters. Here's mine.

1) When firing, aim for centre of mass. No head shots, you're an untrained civilian and you're more likely to hit your target aiming at their chest. Shoot on an empty breath, don't snatch the trigger, squeeze it for a more accurate shot. No full auto, controlled rounds.

2) Keep moving your firing position if in a fight, staying in one spot will get you killed.

3) No shiny objects on show. No watches, necklaces, rings etc. Light will reflect and give away your position. 

4) Eat and drink as much as you can wherever possible as you don't know where your next meal will be from. Obviously don't drink sewage water.  If you're away from enemy detection then boil first.  Be aware you risk attention from military and locals.  

5) Unless you're going to fight with the army, get out of the cities. If you have a tent and sleeping bags, take them. If you don't, you can build simple shelters from sticks and leaves. Drinking water from the running part of a river, not from a standing still lake. You can survive eating bugs if needed, but it's unpleasant. Hunt if you know how.

6) If you can get russian kit, the better. I wouldn't wear their camo as you'll be mistaken for the enemy, that being said taking their weapons system and ammunition is fair game.  Take any food or water left in their destroyed equipment.  

7) If fighting one on one without a gun, everything is fair game. Rip out their eyes if you have to.

8) I know Ukranians and Russian are similar but if it is true that most all Ukranians speak Russian but not all Russians speak Ukranian...then speak Ukrainian at all times.  It may help you ID invaders from fellow citizens.

I imagine a big part of that is destabilizing or sowing the seeds of destruction to one of the great financial tools in modern history. China has their own competitor to swift for example. Russia would most likely pivot to that and Europe would follow suit because they are not giving up Russian fossil fuels. Not at this point at least. 


This is ultimately why sanctions don’t work when used for financial warfare. Russia doesn’t have much left to lose given the sanctions they’ve endured for their bad behavior already. Removal from swift would definitely be a huge blow with nothing left to do afterwards.

Donetsk and Luhask regions will be incorporated into Russia in the near future.

> Russian military killed her mother in the morning. They started shelling their villages, blew up the military bases, the shock waves threw the people away from the window, the house shook, the electricity was gone. While they went to the Kharkhiv to withdraw money and buy food, on returning; Russian tanks blocked the road and fired on the vehicles. They started shooting and her mother got wounded in the arm. She yelled at the Russian soldiers, don't shoot. Heavy shelling begins and eventually her mother got silent. Before anything could happen, her mum left the world. She was hit in the head. At that time ,her father was driving from Kiev at all speeds, not yet knowing that her mother is no more alive and this young girl was hiding herself so that they would not do it with her.

In essence when you ping something it is supposed to respond with information on the connection from your device to the target. If a lot of people run it endlessly it could hypothetically cause the victim server to shit itself and stop working because it has to listen to and respond to so many commands. This is what is called a DDOS attack.

It will be ineffective, however, regardless of how many computers participate. This is because servers (or networks which carry the signal to said servers) can be easily rigged to disregard pings; neutering this particular form of a DDOS attack.

Non-amateur DDOS attacks send more significant commands that cannot (or to be more precise, the victim thinks shouldn't be) ignored. More robust DDOS attacks nowadays make the server think there is a metric fuckton of legitimate, non-bot users that need to be responded to. The specifics become very hairy from this point but suffice to say its a constant back and forth of how to tell your server what is a legitimate user and which is a bot.

That being said, it’s with a heavy heart that, given Putin’s actions and statements, you may need to be very careful. If he chooses to go the route of full fascist dictator, your posts on social media may leave you vulnerable to reprisal by his government and its enforcement arm - or even fellow citizens who buy the propaganda.

Please, consider doing the following:

Scrub your Reddit account of personally identifying information. This includes your name, if any post celebrates or references your birthday, pictures of you, your family, or pets, and anything else that may be traced back to you.

Always connect to Reddit from behind a VPN.

Consider deleting critical posts from Russian-language social media.

If you were educated in the West, it’s likely you’ll be considered naturally suspicious… especially if things do not go Putin’s way. Consider leaving sooner rather than later. Applying for asylum in a European country may be wise for you.

Stay safe. You are all victims as much as Ukraine is.

Putin, by simply suggesting, was able to get Trump into believing that NATO was pointless, and silly for the US to invest so much money into the alliance. Just by dropping some hints here, and some more there, Trump believed it himself and was actively trying to disparage NATO, sow discord between our allies, and if Trump was reelected, I believe Putin would have continued to push Trump to leave NATO.

Also it's hard to say and I'm no political expert by any means, but - considering the supposed low morale of the Russian army and the anti-war protests in Russia, I really hope Putin will be met with enough resistance that he won't be able to continue spreading his influence. I truly want to believe in Ukraine resisting the invasion, even if parts of it are lost. I know some people are disappointed in NATO's refusal to send troops directly to aid Ukraine, but in my opinion that move would lead directly to a potential world war, since it's been openly said that all NATO members will be at war with Russia if even one of us gets attacked, and Putin also said that if anyone assists Ukraine, they'll see grave consequences. So I don't think anyone would be reckless enough to risk starting a conflict on that scale. It makes me feel awful though, because that means we're not allowed to aid Ukraine directly without starting an even more terrifying war. I really hope Putin is not prepared for declaring a war on the entire NATO though, and it's just a strategic bluff. He doesn't seem to have enough power & troops to be able to invade all of Ukraine, sustain that, and then move farther West. Hopefully Ukraine won't fall easily + the sanctions and low motivation of the Russian army will prevent him from reaching for more land. As far as I've heard, the Russian economy is in shambles right now so I honestly don't know who would agree to continue such a mindless futile conflict just to satisfy an old lunatic's sick ambtion. No one wants this war. 

I think the worst possible scenario would be NATO countries getting involved, because I fear that would turn into a nuclear conflict. And even though everyone is like ""well if he tries anything he will get wiped by everyone else after dropping the first bomb"", in that scenario we would all suffer great losses. I don't think it'll come to that though. I want to believe he wouldn't be *that* crazy, and the worst possible scenario would just be some new variation of the Cold War, without anyone actually doing anything. But again, nobody likes Putin at this point so... perhaps someone will do something about that, if you catch my meaning.
