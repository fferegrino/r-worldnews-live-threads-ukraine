Day 264 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today Russians fired quite a lot of missiles from Belgorod, and at an unusual time as well. They started firing missiles around 4:40pm, and were launching them every couple of minutes until 5pm. None of the missiles were aimed at Kharkiv this time, they all landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast.

Yesterday they also fired about 3 missiles, all of which landed in Kharkiv, they hit some industrial facility, and thankfully there were no casualties. While Russians were launching their missiles today at least one of them blew up over Belgorod, and its fragments fell all over the city. People living there were posting photos with those fragments in their hands, and they were big enough that one would absolutely kill you if it fell on you.

Those new developments around left bank of Dnipro River are getting pretty exciting. First our officials were hinting at Kinburn Spit being liberated, then mayor of Oleshky made a couple of posts about Oleshky also being liberated. And then one of pro-Russian people made a post saying that according to his sources Oleshky is indeed liberated, there was an amphibious landing on Kinburn Spit, and that Nova Kakhovka is close to being liberated as well. Of course we should definitely take this information with a grain of salt, but if it turns out to be true, then this is an amazing accomplishment by our forces.

if i grab my comfy armchair, i wouldn't be surprised if Ukraine did manage to gain control over these places. They're definitely under UA fire control, and specifically with HIMARS there's probably little to no heavy arms hanging around right next to the Dniepr. It is also unlikely Russia has enough artillary set up to seriously threaten small boats or pontons to cross the river.

Real question is (assuming these rumours are in any way true) if this is the lead up to further offensive action across the river, or if this is just some outposts that are easy pickings with low troop concentrations.

But the longer i think about it, the more i wonder whether Russia is capable of destroying ponton bridges the way Ukraine has. As far as i'm aware Ukraine mainly used HIMARS to blow up the bridges & pontons. traditional artillary is hardly accurate enough and at high risk of counterfire. 
rockets and drones *could* be threatening for pontons, but we've seen how many get shot down by air defense, so defending a very specific high value objective with multiple air defense systems seems quite viable as well.

Perhaps i am overestimating Ukraine dominance with Himars and air defense, or underestimating capabilities of Russian long range weapons. But it would also be very typical for this war for Russia to assume Ukraine can't support logistics across the river, send all troops towards zaporizja region in defense, and be completely surprised in their rear by a new Ukrainian offensive.

Just send me over to noncredibledefense once it turns out those rumours are all fake ;-)",False,1668456131.0,t3_yuoa41,t3_yuoa41,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

Funding and backing Ukraine, a country who is clearly 'in the right', to effectively fight and significantly weaken one of your biggest world adversaries for you is a no-brainer. 

You've also seen the policy here be very effective. The US going gung-ho alone would have been stupid and alienated NATO allies. NATO going all-in and taking out Putin right away would have just seen the next person in line step in to run the same broken Russian system. Doing nothing would have likely ended Ukraine and emboldened Russia to continue empire building. The current course has greatly destabilized the whole of internal Russia, brought NATO allies together, pushed Russia's friends away from them, and has a small chance of ultimately resulting in revolution in Russia.

Not exactly true.  Russian traditional artiliary fire isn't accurate enough, but that's by design.  Part of their doctrine is to only be semi accurate with their artiliary, to both save on cost (making things accurate=$$$$$!) and to make their artiliary strikes look more devastating than they actually are in order to demoralize the enemy.

Also, Ukraine used HIMARS to damage the bridges, not destroy them.  The bridges across the Dnipro were in range of tube artiliary for awhile, but they left the bridges passable to troops on foot to create two kill boxes, one on each side of each bridge.  Per UA's claims, Russia lost [10K troops](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-loses-10000-troops-two-weeks-defenses-crumble-ukraine-1759159) in the last two weeks.

The ones that are getting through are the Iranian drones (though they are also getting hammered by Gepard units), so I think we can assume they are in short supply right now.

By your characterization, the understanding of Yermak’s message sounds as if BBC’s understanding of his riddle is a dubious conclusion—it’s not.

Let’s see:

- Russians have reported a history of seizing UA marines attempting to land for months.  Maybe, but never showed evidence, pows, never confirmed by UA. 

- The spokeswoman for the southern command has said for two days there’s operations underway there.

- Vitaliy Kim posted a emoji message, implying operation and waiting for success. 

- Ukrainian press posted large smoke plumes there early today.

- Ukrainian Ministry of Defense posted a video where at least 8 small, inflatable motor vessels of marines can be seen crossing the Dnipro River.

- *Defense Express* reported the route that the marines took, and how far ashore they were able to push back the Russians.

- a wave of Russian milbloggers posted frustrated confessions that UA had successfully overtaken the spit.

- RF MOD, defiantly publishes news to dispute the milbloggers, saying all UA marines who launched amphibious assault were destroyed. 

- Yermak accompanied Zelensky to Kherson.

- Yermak later publishes the emoji-riddle—a direct dispute of RF MOD— specifically this: 🌊 + 🏖 = 💪  which was code (spell out the village) for successful amphibious assault.

- then, an Air Force source in the security forces confirmed to the BBC that the Armed Forces of Ukraine were indeed ""successful"" on the Kinburn spit.",1668464158.0,1668463578.0,t3_yuoa41,t1_iwdl4d9,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

* UA doesn't have to carry ammunition and artillery as they can fire from the other side of the Dnieper, so they only have to ensure logistics for the soldiers and we know they were given a lot of small boats by US (they can probably use helis too)
* The front between the peninsula and the rest is the only one Russia wasn't ready to defend (here assuming the intelligence was right)

Entirely possible.  It'll really be a hindsight game.

If he's actually in good health, he might have consolidated some more, but in the end done similar.  That is, unless Trump had actually broken up NATO and/or made it tough to operate as a coalition.

&#x200B;

>If the people of Ukraine didn’t put up that much of a fight at the start of the war, the West wouldn’t have done anything but sanctions and Ukraine would be apart of Russia now.

This is correct-ish.  Yes, if they Ukranians didn't put up a hell of a damn fight, it would be mostly sanctions (and some lethal aid), because supplying lethal aid to just get it captured and used against you / your allies is bad mojo.  In 2014 the Ukranian armed forces were also heavily infiltrated with Russians, and it wasn't unlikely that many of the weapons would make it to the black market.

But you ignore that after Crimea, the US/NATO/Ukraine formed a major coalition where we spent years modernizing and training the Ukranian forces.  I mean, they couldn't resist in Crimea.  One of the generals tells story after story of laying down traps and ambushes on the incoming Russian troops, and then just not being able to execute.  Just because they brought like 12 tank busters with them, and not a single one fired (old Russian stock), and similar.  They didn't have weapons to fight with.  So they turned West and we trained them and supported them, and now they can fight.  ""Sanctions and nothing else"" -- you mean other than reforming their whole armed forces and turning them into a world class fighting machine.  Aka, the long game.

&#x200B;

Their armed forces weren't able to fight in 2014, but they were ready for this time.  So this time the US supported them more heavily.  The only time that was in jeopardy was when Trump was trying to extort them and use our supplying of lethal aid as a bargaining chip for him.",False,1668442499.0,t3_yuoa41,t1_iwc72b6,,4,6,0,6,0,0,

The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while constitutional provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted. The small coat of arms was designed by Andriy Grechylo, Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi.

of perpetual adversarial competition in the information environment by encouraging the development of a disinformation and propaganda ecosystem that allows for varied and overlapping approaches that reinforce each other even when individual messages within the system appear contradictory.”   

This is a primary tactic of Russian propaganda.   They don’t try to convince people of an idea.   They try to perpetuate adversarial debate that causes people to throw up their hands and disengage rather than choosing a side.   This is why Russia has such a disengaged apathetic population.

That whole national sovereignty is a relatively recent development, and I for one am of the opinion that the idea of a nation and nationalism is one of the worst ideas in mankinds history. I truly see no reason to fight for the symbol of an flag or the idea of an nation. Human lives should be taken for one reason only: To save more human lives. Everything else is humbug. This is what makes this war sadly so clear-cut: Ukraine has to fight and has to win to save their citizens because Russia is a terror state.
