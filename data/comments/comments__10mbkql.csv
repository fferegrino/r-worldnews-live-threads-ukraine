Day 337-338 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday we had yet another big missile strike, none of the missiles that were fired were aimed at our region, so it was pretty quiet here the entire time. They started firing the missiles very early this time, we already had reports of incoming missiles around 7am, while most of the past missile strikes started around 9-10am, with some of them starting as late as 4pm.

There are conflicting reports of the real numbers of missiles that were fired, at first it was said that we intercepted 47 out of 55 missiles, which seems like the most likely case as there were less than 10 confirmed hits on our infrastructure. Then there was another reports from today saying that they fired 74 missiles, but there were definitely less than 27 hits or we would have known about them. I guess they might have counted some other strikes across the frontline in the 74 missiles number, I don‚Äôt really see any other option.

The entire missile strike seemed pretty inconsequential, yes, they hit some of our energy infrastructure, but we are used to it by this point, the situation with electricity didn‚Äôt get significantly worse from it. They even fired 2 of their ‚Äúhypersonic‚Äù Kinzhals at Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia, which we can‚Äôt intercept, they hit their targets, but so what? It didn‚Äôt really change anything. I guess it just shows how upset Russians were about tank deliveries that they decided to fire their wonder weapons at us. Well, at least North Korea has Russia‚Äôs back, they will console them about the ‚Äúevil west trying to inflict defeat on them‚Äù. I would be very concerned if my country‚Äôs best ally was North Korea, but it seems Russia welcomes it.

Vuhledar holds - the situation is stable at this moment. Enemy attempts to establish footholds near Vuhledar to develop the assault have failed. Attempts to outflank and take control over roads completely failed. Please re-tweet.

2/4 The enemy is demoralized by losses, which is why they are bringing additional reinforcements, but we will see in the nearest days if they will be able to throw them for another large assault.

3/4 It's known to us that they are trying to return wounded people to the frontlines just two days after the injury. Some squads and platoons sustained 80-90% casualties which significantly demoralizes the enemy.

4/4 The situation is still difficult but more stable: the enemy continues to replenish their losses with additional manpower. They have lost advantages that they were able to get during the first two days.

Despite heavy sanctions, microchips made by Dutch companies still end up in Russia. It concerns many millions of pieces since the beginning of the invasion in Ukraine up to and including December.  
Exports go through intermediaries. Several hundred deliveries have gone to three Russian companies linked to defense companies. 'Dutch' chips have also been found in Russian weapons.  
The joint investigative editors of the NOS and Nieuwsuur were given access to trade data, spoke to involved companies, government agencies, experts and researchers, and were given access to confidential documents. The study provides the first insight into the scale on which microchips from Dutch manufacturers end up in Russia.  
There is a clear pattern of a small group of Chinese companies obtaining Dutch chips and exporting them to Russia month after month. One such company is on the US sanctions list for supplies to the Russian defense industry. Despite the increasingly stricter sanctions, no decline in exports has been visible in recent months.  
In armored howitzer and combat helicopter  
The Dutch chips that go to Russia mainly come from major chip producers such as NXP from Eindhoven and Nexperia from Nijmegen. The NOS/Nieuwsuur investigation shows that NXP microchips were recently found on the battlefield in Ukraine.

Bruce Buena de Mesquita and co-authors of [Selectorate Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory) expand on this nicely in ""The logic of Political Survival"" and the more popularized ""The Dictator's Handbook"".

Dictator's need the funds they are extracting from their population to reward their cronies with material benefits. Spending too much money on war, and not the cronies disgruntles said cronies (treasurer, generals, police, etc) that keep him in power.

Democracies on the other hand fight with much broader support from the people, and typically see their fights as an an actual flight for survival. This definitely is the case for Ukraine is this conflict. Therefor they are able to commit a much higher percentage of their resources (including human resources) of to the fight, and keep going much longer than dictatorships.

>I personally believe that when Putin falls he will be painted as a villain within Russia and that his people will be purged. 

Agree. 

>The only way the new leader can have power is by turning on those currently in power and to call out their failures. We are seeing it weekly with Prigozhin talking negatively about military brass and tactics. He is advertising on tv, doing interviews and claiming all successes as Wagner successes, not Russian successes. And guess what? It‚Äôs working. Prigozhin has the ultranationalists, military bloggers, and even state media pumping his messaging. 

Is it working? First of all, the state messaging has always been this way. It's always been the batshit crazy ultra-nationalist frenzy that it is now, even since before Crimea. That is not Prigozhin's invention - he is just another product of that. And despite what reddit thinks, milbloggers and actual ethnonationalists are not even close to a majority of the population. Even outside of urban areas like Petersburg and Moscow, hard-core ethnonationalists are a minority. The vast majority of Russians are the apathetic and withdrawn kind who don't give a  shit about politics and certainly don't give a shit about Prigozhin. Especially in the urban areas. 

And the reason most are apathetic is exactly because of this kind of messaging. The ""firehose of bullshit"" or whatever you want to call it. The whole point is to make people down in constantly changing vitriolic information so that they disregard any concept of truth. Putin never wanted propaganda to convince people of a singular idea - that's actually dangerous because it could present a threat to him. As it stands, ultra-nationalists are a minor threat, but not really. 

And he is not the only one criticising the military. He has also recently had a massive public failure and the reshuffle recently shows that Putin is quite ready to shunt Prigozhin to the side and there isn't jack shit that Prigozhin can do about it. 

>Add in that he controls the Internet Research Agency that is a bot farm, he can further amplify his messages. When the failure of Russia is finally obvious to the citizens they will be angry at Putin and all who surround him. Prigozhin is setting himself up to be the popular, competent and powerful alternative. 

Prigozhin has all the charisma of a decomposed rat. Honestly, go out into the street of any Russian city or town and ask people what they think of Prigozhin. Those that even know who he is, mostly won't care. Ultranationalism isn't ""popular"". It's scary to apathetic Russians. Russians want one thing: the ability to keep their heads down and carry on what's left of their lives. They don't care about anything else. 

>The FSB will face the choice of supporting Putin to their detriment or to turn on him out of self preservation. I just can‚Äôt envision, and I may well be completely wrong,the Putin structure remaining.

As I said, if the FSB turn on Putin, it will absolutely not be to Prigozhin. Prigozhin is a real threat to all the current FSB heads, because if he got into power he will purge them. They will support one of their own or a technocrat who is no threat at all. Unless you can argue convincingly why the FSB would ever side with Prigozhin, let's put this Prigozhin president stuff to rest.",False,1674802752.0,t3_10mbkql,t3_10mbkql,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

It could be argued that they got *extremely close*. So close that it all boiled down to the battle over a single location; Hostomel airfield.

Russia earmarked it early as a ""air bridge"" to take Kyiv, and the VDV took it within the first few hours of the invasion despite the operation being being a shitshow. But it changed hands so many times during the attempted siege of Kyiv that Russia never controlled it enough to establish it as a base, and the ill-fated convoy never made it far enough South to reinforce the few units which were defending it.

If Hostomel fell they could have started landing units and completed the encirclement of Kyiv. With it in Ukraine's control the capital couldn't be taken and the whole Northern offensive was a wash.

>I MUST make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the last few years
I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great
stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councillor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate
who is more devoted to order than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace
which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods
of direct action""; who paternalistically feels that he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of
time; and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of
good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more
bewildering than outright rejection.

Their sole purpose is to be shot by the Ukrainians and in doing so they give away their positions to the Russians who sent the prisoners on their suicide run. The amount of ammo really is just enough to make a noise but not enough to waste on a soon to be dead prisoner. They really are cannon fodder and nothing more.  

One reason for using prisoners and Wagner mercenaries is because Putin hopes that the Russian public won't care if those ""types"" of people are killed rather than their own friends and family.  

The prisoners who sign up may do so because they would rather get out of long sentences and/or horrible prison conditions and take a chance on surviving the war. Initially they may not have known just how worthless and expendable they were. Deserting Wagner is discouraged by gruesome public executions. They make sure the prisoners know to fear them more than dying on the battlefield.  

As for why Putin is using Wagner, well Putin loves plausible deniability. In his paranoid KGB mind he gets to say that they aren't part of the Russian army and are not under his control. In reality they are supplied by the Russian army and given instructions by the GRU. It's a stupid and blatantly obvious game he plays but it's how the Kremlin, the KGB and now FSB have always worked.  

There was a time when the Russians left some Wagner solders to die when they got too close to an American camp. The Americans contacted their Russian counterpart and told them to order their men back but they denied they knew them and didn't tell the Wagner men to get out of there. The Americans threw everything they had at them, completely overpowered them. They picked up radio chatter from those panicking men as they suddenly realised that the Russians had left them to die.

Here's how this tactic works, and why it sometimes does succeed:

- The Russians send poorly trained, poorly equipped soldiers through pre-sighted Ukrainian artillery killing fields
- Most of the untrained soldiers die very quickly
- Russian special forces with better training and equipment sneak through the less frenetic holes with less artillery coverage
- Russian counter-battery fire attempts to either suppress or knock-out the Ukrainian artillery that is busy dealing with the infantry swarms
- Ukraine ends up having to withdraw a few hundred meters back to the next line
- Ukraine incrementally exhausts shells, tubes, launchers, and front-line troops

If Russia truly commits to these tactics with 1+ million conscripts, prisoners and enslaved press-ganged Ukrainians, this probably is going to start having negative impact on the Ukrainian Army's ability to defend territory. Defending against these tactics is very expensive both for Ukrainian manpower and artillery supplies.

The best way I rationalize what I'm seeing is, it's a conveyor of lies. Everyone from Putin on down to the BMP driver leaving his buddies to their deaths is lying both to themselves and to everyone around them. The chain of lies connects the BMP driver to Putin, each link just as illogical and perverse as the other. 

These men are dead because Putin is desperate to stay in power; Gerasimov is desperate to prove himself; their c/o is desperate to report a success; their driver is desperate to get the fuck out of there while he's got a chance; and the cannon fodder in the back is desperate to follow orders and not step out of line. Not a single one is capable of original thought or finding an original way out, so they all fall back on decades of propaganda. 

WWII propaganda has dominated these men's entire lives, and so they all pattern their behavior on the movies.

Correct, but the American armor forces had all the time they needed to safely clear paths through mine-layered defenses because all of the enemy artillery was suppressed with constant, overwhelming air supremacy.

Ukraine will not have this advantage.

>Iraqi soldiers found that they could stop the Abrams by hitting the tracks at close range with anti-tank missiles. The TUSK upgrade solved many of the issues found in Iraq. There was very few loss of life situations in Iraq.

Iraqi soldiers did not have anti-tank missiles that fire top-down liquid plastic through the roofs of Western tanks. Russia does.

This was what people thought At the time.

Norman Shwarzkopf was asked what his assesment of the iraq army was and he said.   
""They were the fourth largest army in the world, number one. Number two, the economy of Iraq was such that we knew that they could not absorb all the soldiers out of the military back into the economy and therefore the army was going to stay in place. And, number three, they had, in fact, in the Al Fao campaign, for instance, fought quite a credible offensive armored battle.

They had Soviet equipment, they had French equipment, they had British equipment, they had, for instance, from the tanks they imported, they had three different generations of Soviet tank from a very early rudimentary generation of T-55, all the way up to the T-72 which was a very, very good tank.
