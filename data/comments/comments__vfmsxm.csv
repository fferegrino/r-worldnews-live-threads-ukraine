Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 June 2022


- In recent days, both Russia and Ukraine have continued to conduct heavy artillery bombardments on axes to the north, east and south of the Sieverodonetsk pocket, but with little change in the front line.

- Combat units from both sides are committed to intense combat in the Donbas and are likely experiencing variable morale. Ukrainian forces have likely suffered desertions in recent weeks, however, Russian morale highly likely remains especially troubled. Cases of whole Russian units refusing orders and armed stand-offs between officers and their troops continue to occur.

- The Russian authorities likely struggle to bring legal pressure to bear on military dissenters, hampered by the invasion's official status as a 'special military operation' rather than as a war. Drivers for low Russian morale include perceived poor leadership, limited opportunity for rotation of units out of combat, very heavy casualties, combat stress, continued poor logistics, and problems with pay. Many Russian personnel of all ranks also likely remain confused about the war's objectives.

Day 116 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet today, but as is tradition at 11pm they started firing their missiles from Belgorod at us yet again.

Now, Stoltenberg says, the price for stopping him must be paid even if costs are high in energy/food prices.

>Russia imposes restrictions on shipments of Kazakh oil after the country's President Kassym Jomart Tokayev made a series of harsh statements at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.
The export of oil, which Kazakhstan decided to rename so that Western buyers would not confuse it with the sub-sanctioned Russian grade Urals, has been stopped at the port of Novorossiysk, Kommersant reported, citing sources familiar with the situation.
The reason, according to Kommersant's sources, is that objects that could be mines from World War II were found in the port water area. The water area adjacent to the outriggers of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), which pumps 67 million tons a year through the pipeline to the Russian port for export, was closed for investigations.
The next demining work is scheduled for 20 June and may last until the end of the month, Kommersant sources said.
[2:59 PM]
The CPC already stopped work on the two TLU's less than three months ago, when they were damaged during a storm. The new stoppage took place against the backdrop of Tokayev's visit to St Petersburg, where the Kazakh president cancelled with unexpected statements to the Kremlin.
In particular, he said that Kazakhstan does not recognise the DPR and LPR because it considers them ""quasi-state entities"". ""If a nation's right to self-determination is implemented across the globe, then instead of 193 states, there will be more than 500-600 states on Earth. It will be chaos,"" Tokayev explained, 
He also criticized State Duma deputies and Russian propagandists under President Vladimir Putin, accusing them of sowing ""discord"" between the countries. Tokayev hinted explicitly at Russia Today head Margarita Simonyan's husband Tigran Keosayan, who had earlier recorded a video accusing Kazakhstan of ingratitude and suggesting that he ""look at what is happening in Ukraine"".
Konstantin Zatulin, head of the Committee on CIS Affairs, considered Tokayev's statements inappropriate and threatened to take measures ""like with Ukraine"".
""We say everywhere and everywhere, including Ukraine: if we have friendship, cooperation and partnership, then no territorial issues are raised. And if not, then everything is possible. As in the case of Ukraine. That is why it seems to me that this side of things in Kazakhstan and beyond would be worth paying attention to"", Zatulin said.

If I'm reading this translation of his correctly it seems the Russians are now trying to put the screws to Kazakhstan's oil trade under the same sort of ""Its not intentional, there are legitimate safety concerns"" bullshit excuse that they are giving to some European countries for shutting off their oil flow.

I get that this is a tool of political pressure but I really don't think its going to have the desired effect in a country that already seems to be running as fast as it can away from associating with what Russia is doing currently.",False,1655669299.0,t3_vfmsxm,t3_vfmsxm,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

They want to liberate Kherson, then push through to the Sea of Azov. This does 3 things: it sieges Crimea (they'd likely blow the bridge at this time), cuts off the eastern/northern fronts from the southern front, & causes Russia to overextend their supply line south to near Melitopol.

With access to the Sea of Azov, they can take out any resupply ships.

If things go well in Severodonetsk, at this point Ukraine can attack from the south & the north, squeezing Russia in a pincer movement. The hardest part will be pushing Russia back to the border but if all goes well, Russia could be contained to Luhansk. And Crimea might be able to be taken with little bloodshed via a siege.

They will likely have to divert at least some resources from the salient to other areas of the lines. 

RU only had a plan A with taking Kiev, and the southern front in Kherson was part of that plan.  However, Plan A failed.  BUt Kherson was not.  Now they need to fall onto Plan B which did not really exist at the time of invasion on taking Donbas.  Kherson and Zaporizhia Oblasts I think at this moment could potentially make Plan B unobtainable.  

RU has a lot of forces in these two Oblasts they are not using to secure Donbas.  RU is getting attacked in these areas, slowly lossing ground and will need additional resources.  Any resources that come from the area of the salient will make RU grip on the salient even weaker.  The weaker RU gets in the salient, the stronger UA gets and it becomes a more easily defendable position. Directly impacts Russia's success of Plan B.  

The longer the salient holds, and the more RU forces loss ground in Kherson and Zaporizhia Oblasts, I think the higher likely hood that they become largely abandoned so that Donbas can be successful. Or even Russian forces fall back to the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast.

It's difficult to tell you why without hurting your feelings.  This is just an incredibly amateur and simplistic series of statements that bears nothing of Ukraine's practical realities.  It'd be like taking a map of Axis-occupied France a year before the Normandy landing and drawing a red arrow from Britain *through the ass end of Italy* and say 'see, this is the goal, disrupt the med sea supply lines, home by Christmas'.  

Yeah, they'd sure like to do that, but OTOH, such a thing is achievable only through so many specific (and more important) intermediate goals, which are utterly ignored here, and which must happen in sequence, and each of which is months away.  

To say nothing of how Melitopol is more straightforwardly freed from Russian influence through the Zaporizhzhia front than the Kherson one, or how there's virtually nothing left in Mariupol to liberate, and if there were, it wouldn't be a usable port right now.  Even the Russians are having a hard time docking things there.  

You can watch how difficult a pincer (two-front) operation is to complete by watching Russian forces in the Donbas right now.  There's zero chance (and zero reason) Ukraine would collapse all their fronts together into one eastern front in a pincer 100 times that scale.   Kherson right now can be termed a 'supporting front', like Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia.  It has far fewer personel and equipment attached to it compared to the main front.  

It also ignores the fact that Ukraine's militia forces (half or greater of its military efforts) are compartmentalized by region.  These brigades have to source their own weapons and rations and answer more to their state/oblast than the army.  The army cannot simply send them somewhere else, not easily anyway.  Virtually no troops from Kharkiv, following the counteroffensives there, were freed up to go fight in the Izyum, S-D, or Donetsk salients.  They went back to police, construction, fire, whatever they were before, or maintain defensive positions.  

So why would Kherson victories in any way shape or form result in that front moving eastward until it meets up with the Donbas front?  They would have to stay and defend what they've taken, as well as clear and administrate those areas.",1655698139.0,1655697550.0,t3_vfmsxm,t1_id0qbh6,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

They had 200K active duty at the start of the invasion, plus 900K reservists. Perhaps 700K well qualified new troops is just too optimistic so lets say half that.  350K more solid homeland defenders from a country of 44M people seems very doable. 

Step 2 is get them equipped and trained, not just toss them into the front lines, which is where the UK offer and others come in. 

RU's original invasion force was also about 200K.  With 30K dead and a generous 2:1 casualty ratio that's 60K out of action, leaving 140K.  Ukraine defenders lets say 20K KIA and 3:1 casualties so thats also about 60K so far.  Or, 20K per month each.

Then as UA starts layering in 20K+ fresh well-equipped well-trained (10K by UK, 10K+ by others) reinforcements every month combined with also improving armaments and watch the balance of power leannnnn until RU fronts collapse.

Even if RU wanted to counter this they'd have to throw in 2-3x as many troops per month just to counter the UA advantage in equipment, training, and lets not forget morale.

Essentially what he is doing, is trying to draw parallels to racism existing, and good and bad.

I.e. the warnings in the article are mentioning to be understanding/know that racism will exist.

Racism exists everywhere, and different countries are more or less at ""Different levels"" of advancement/progress/inclusion/diversity. 

We all know this. But these silly little trolls try to run with it, Racism exists in Ukraine thus they are the bad guys.

More racism exists in Russia, what's your point? More nazi's exist in russia, what's your point? They are an authoritarian nightmare fascist state invading other countries. What's your point?

Out of all the countries in eastern Europe, pre-USSR countries, Ukraine actually scores basically the highest when it comes to LGBT rights, and the lowest when it comes to racism. 

Does that mean it doesn't occur? Or progress doesn't need to be made? Or a large portion of the country isn't racist/bigoted in some way?

No, like all countries from Canada, UK, US, Name X European country here, it exists. It's how it's dealt with and if things are getting better over time which is what matter. 

Racism, Sexism and all bigoted behavior takes time to root out and changes over time. There is no country where racism does not exist.

For example, 5% of Ukraine legit hates the jews!

Well...

https://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/news/antisemitism-in-europe-ukraine-turns-out-to-be-the-most-friendly-to-jews/

In context though, 5% isn't high and they are the most friendly in the area with least amounts of anti-Semitism. 

But these trolls take some fact and try to run with it. He would use a 5% figure to condemn a country, because his goal isn't to discuss, it's to argue in bad faith and paint a narrative.

So essentially the warnings say don't be surprised if you hear the n-word. The n-word also has differing weight outside US/Americas, as does black face. Does it make it right? No. Does it carry the same historical significance it did in the US? No. Can things get better? Yes. Are things getting better and have they been trending in the right direction for decades?

What people usually don't realize about peer military conflicts is that just comparing the overall numbers of supplies, troops or vehicles is not a reliable way to gauge who has the upper hand. In conflicts of this scale, *both* sides can independently have their own local areas where they are doing well. *Neither* side has enough equipment, manpower or logistical capacity to sustain a fully outfitted front line in all areas. They have to take risks and choose local areas to commit concentrations of force.

Narratives of which side is ""winning"" and ""losing"" almost always lose track of this reality. For example, people often talk about the USSR's performance in WW2 in this linear narrative track, where they were doing ""poorly"" in 1941 and 1942 but started doing ""well"" in 1943 and onward, when the reality is that both Germany and the USSR had several local victories throughout all years of the war. Russia launched brutal counter-offensives in Winter 1941 before Germany had even reached Moscow -- they just weren't in the optimal areas, and they were not organized or led very effectively, so they took horrific losses. Germany was on the backfoot in summer 1943, yet they still launched a massive tank offensive -- the largest in history, still to this day -- at Kursk. In 1942, when operational maneuvering still had the chance to swing the fight in the direction of either side, both Germany and the USSR had very big offensive successes -- but they were in different areas of the front, where their opponent was weakest and least equipped to handle them.

In another example, perhaps most familiar to Western audiences, Germany exacted a heavy toll on the Allies in Winter 1945 with its infamous Ardenne offensive. They committed 30 of the best outfitted divisions they had, including almost all of their remaining combat-effective armored and mechanized divisions and practically of their remaining air force, after stripping many of these units where they were needed most on the Eastern Front. These 30 divisions punched a big hole through the Allied line, and for about a week there was genuine fear that it might undo much of the past 6 months of the Allies' advance through France and Belgium. But in reality, all it did was completely exhaust what little remained of Germany's combat-effective force. Within a week, its great armored push stalled after running out of precious fuel, and most of the tanks were destroyed or abandoned due to equipment breakdowns. Historians largely agree that this offensive, while an effectively concentrated force that far outweighed the strength of the Allies *in that small, local area*, probably actually hastened Germany's defeat by several months.

An important factor in these counteroffensives was a guessing game of trying to predict ahead of time where the enemy would mass his forces, and trying to both defend against those impending attacks while also secretly building up your own forces for a push where you predict the enemy will not be waiting for you. Both Russia and Germany had many instances where they successfully and unsuccessfully out-concentrated each other. Either side can be ""losing"" the overall war while simultaneously attaining brilliant offensive victories in a few localized areas -- but usually at the cost of depleting their strength elsewhere where it might be badly needed.

The same is almost certainly true with the war in Ukraine. The UA might overall be suffering from a severe lack of critical ammunition or equipment, but if they concentrate what they have in the right areas, it might be enough to overwhelm a poorly defended Russian area. Conversely, Russia appears to be suffering from a severe manpower problem, but they are hoping to commit all their reserves to the Donbass and try to break Ukraine's will to fight before it matters. Both of these choices are probably dangerous. Time will tell if these resource commitment gambles pay off for either side.",1655658313.0,1655657575.0,t3_vfmsxm,t1_icyept2,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

The ""UK"" is stepping up because Russia has fucked with us over and over again. Putin tried to fucking pull [this stunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal#Chronology_of_events) and he got away with it. That's before all the bribery and election meddling.

Boris is doing this because 80%+ of the population want him to. Most vox pops interviews are now essentially, ""He's doing great in Ukraine, but I still hate him,"" or ""Thank god we've got Boris instead of Corbyn, who would've totally fucked up Ukraine"".

If the US actively told us to back down, it's possible that we would. But either with their support or indifference, we'll happily support Ukraine and spite Russia.

We (at least USA) have been pumping arms into Israel for more than half a century.  The defense budget has been obscene since the 80s.  

What I mean is that Ukraine should have full agency in negotiations with the Russians.  The decision to accept or decline a deal should be entirely theirs to make.  Ukraine does not owe us anything (other than cash that was specifically loans, bonds etc).  All members of NATO do not have that option if someone in NATO gets attacked.  

Any deal has pros and cons.  When Ukraine decides to continue fighting soldiers die.  It is better for them, family, and friends to know they fought for their country.  No Ukrainians should feel they have to die in order to satisfy western demands.  When Ukraine decides to settle anything conceded needs to be concessions that Ukraine chose to make.  It should not contain anything that the west decided was not worth fighting for.  There is a spectrum of hypothetical possible deals.  Pressure from the West in either direction on that spectrum is a worse outcome than Ukraine freely determining that either direction is the better course.  

For me ""no strings attached"" does not include things like war crimes.  They should make sure that the liberation of Kherson is done in a way that is appreciated by residents of Kherson.  

What i oppose is the conversations where some westerners are saying ""do not humiliate Putin"" and others are saying ""Putin must be humiliated"".

So what we did was install a small heat pump only for water and then installed a couple of infrared wall panels for main heating.

All in all, you can not do it just by snapping with your fingers.

As people have said it doesn't matter the party in power in the UK. The result would be the same. That's because UK realises its in its interest to do so and its interests align with the US.

If they US said, we will make the announcements you just follow. That's what we would be doing.

If the US says you lead, we follow that's what happens.

We don't care either way, because we support the underlying action. How the UK/USA presents it to the world doesnt matter to them

It does matter on a larger scale though to other parties. 

UK sends a message to Eastern Europe, here we are. Eastern europe approves.

We use discard sabots on tank ammunition which has extremely high accuracy.  I am proposing a sabot machined or stamped in a garage in a third world country. Lets give it width of moon (30 minutes arc, 30 inch at 100 yard) so crap but going in the right direction competitive with a musket or bb gun.  You do not need an accurate shot if the shell is rocket boosted and guided.  Mortar is much lower velocity which means nothing breaks.  Is there any reason why a guided munition cannot be manually thrown from the cockpit of a sopwith camel?  Mortars are much lower range.  If you are about to be over run by wave of tanks your short range is target saturated.  You just want to burn the stockpile before they get any closer.

""Javelins and NLAW are apples to oranges"".  Yes.  Bananas are also fruit.  Bagels can be eaten too.  A man near starvation feels a little better with anything edible.  Designer jeans, a sexy prom costume, sterling silverware, or a gold candelabra are much more expensive.  They are not edible but might be accessories to a dinner. 

Gold bullets are superior to lead bullets.  Gold is soft and much denser.  That increases impact energy.  Some people want to argue for steel or steel jackets but in that case let me introduce you to the elements iridium and osmium.  They alloy with iron so any property of steel jackets you want can be tweaked if you give me a budget and a lab.  Gold bullets are not in anyone's inventory.  That is not an indication lead has any preferable characteristic except being much cheaper. 

 In the case of USA we would pay for gold bullets if manufacturers could source a cheap raw material and turn it into gold bullets.  There is also a non trivial problem that using gold bullets would motivate people to try and get the army to shoot at them so that the rounds can be dug out and sold.  A classic Samuel colt six shooter with gold bullets is better than a 6 shooter with lead bullets.  A modern assault rifle or machine gun is vastly superior.

So therefore you do understand exactly what I said, and you understand that racism, and terms, and progress depend on historical context, and where countries are at in the world.

You're just pretending for this post to not understand that. Which is why you're bringing up racism in Ukraine.

Secondly, you are ignoring WHY Ukraine isn't able to support itself RIGHT NOW (not historically). Historically they are fine, EVEN though they have been pillaged by Russia for decades.

Ukraine can't support itself RIGHT NOW because they are at war. Ghost_throw's comment is insinuating that because Urkraine can't support itself RIGHT NOW is evidence they COULD NEVER support themselves, aka that it doesn't exist as a natoin.

You agreed with that point, and you are wrong. And you are dumb that this needed to be explained to you like a child.

Ukraine isn't the Proud Boys what's referred to are individuals saying the N-word not an entire country saying the N-word.

The proud boys aren't a country that people are born into it. If they made a commune it would be a cult. If they were invaded it would likely be by the FBI given how they operate.

The equivalent to what you're saying is if the National Corps and Right Sector parties in Ukraine made a commune and then got invaded by Russia. Which, in that case, sure, I don't care nearly as much.

>In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election the coalition of Svoboda and the other extreme-right political parties in Ukraine ‚Äï National Corps, the Governmental Initiative of Yarosh, and the Right Sector ‚Äï won only 2.15% of the vote combined and failed to pass the 5% threshold.\[5\]\[6\] No far-right parties gained seats in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament), as they all failed to win any single-mandate constituency seat.\[6\]

The most racist two parties in Ukraine received about 2.5%. Equivalent parties in France receive several times that in votes, and very similar parties to those are *in power* in Poland.

On top of that you have Zelenskyy who has been advancing social issues in a better direction, mostly on the sexual freedom front.

Is it great? No, not at all, there's a lot of racism in Ukraine, less than Russia. Has Ukraine been headed in a better direction? Yes.

Is this relevant to the morality of Russia invading Ukraine? No.

Are you ignorantly trying to own the libs or push Russian propaganda? I don't know, and frankly I don't care.",False,1655687166.0,t3_vfmsxm,t1_id09ifx,,9,3,0,3,0,0,
