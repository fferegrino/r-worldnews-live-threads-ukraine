A former joint forces command chief says he thinks a purported arms contract seen by Sky News is the ""first documentary evidence that Iran supports things like artillery, ammunition"".

General Sir Richard Barrons says: ""We've known for some time that Iran is supplying weapons to Russia"" in the form of the Shahed-136 drones, often known as kamikaze drones, which have featured heavily in air attacks on Kyiv.

An informed security source claimed a purported arms contract seen by Sky News offers the first hard evidence that Iran has sold ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine.

Speaking about the impact of support from Iran on Russia's ability in the war, Sir Richard Barrons says last year Moscow ""probably fired around 10 years worth of its annual production of artillery ammunition"".

He adds that both Kyiv and Moscow are short this year.

""The key message is because this war has turned into a big war that's going on for a very long time, I guess it does show that either side can only win if they are supported by their industry. In the case of Russia mobilising its own industry in the case of Ukraine, Ukraine can only win if the West mobilises its defence industry in ways that it's talked about but has not yet really got going on.""

A famous Russian-language singer, Nadezhda Babkina, who herself is from minority-populated Southern Russia, [is an ethnic Cossack but from a Tatar-descended region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadezhda_Babkina), yet nevertheless is pro-Putin, visited occupied Mariupol and expresses surprise that even the older soviet generation of residents are blaming the Russians for destroying the city rather than hailing their ‘liberation.’

(During the Battle of Stalingrad, a group of Soviet soldiers defended there for a long time.) The entertainer stubbornly continues to tell pro-Putin viewers that Russia is not to blame for the murders of Ukrainians. It is obvious that Babkina forgot how beautiful Mariupol was until February 24, 2022.

> Babkina spoke again about the fact that Ukraine is ‘a part of Russia.’ The artist called Ukrainians ""scoundrels"" who ""made a mess"" and have been building an independent state.

>> ""Everything will be as it should be. You know, the scoundrels got a little angry. Succumbed to some provocative things. But everything will end successfully. Obviously, we are going the right way, comrades,"" the Russian singer added.


> In response, a famous TV presenter reacted to Babkina's visit to Mariupol— Andriy Bidnyakov—who was born and grew up in a long-suffering Ukrainian city—reacted on his social network page to Babkina's arrival: *""Nadia Babkina with her singing army and Botox came and took a photo against the background of the Mariupol Drama Theater.

>Publicly, senior US officials have condemned the strikes inside Russia, warning of the potential for an escalation of the war.

c9f518c0620797dc9e2ab2daeb70f6c6,1411ier,jmyv1h1,"Let's take ourselves back to summer 2022. 

&#x200B;

Ukraine announced they were going to take back Kherson. They built up forces. They increased strikes on Russians logistics chains,  heavily helped by the introduction of HIMARS to the battlefield. They pushed and probed, attempted a bridgehead over a defensible river course and inevitably, as any attacking force will, had losses of equipment and men. 

At that time they were still fighting with the Russians having artillery numerical (albeit not efficiency) dominance. Lots of the armour was taken out by this artillery, especially in presighted defensible areas supported by minefields.  It's worth noting that  Russia definitely is behind now in efficient artillery systems, UKR has the range and accuracy advantage.  I'm intrigued to see whether Russia still have a numerical advantage,  I'm beginning to believe they don't and especially not in a way that can cover the entire frontline pre sighted which they were able to do in a small frontline in Kherson.  Pre sighting is very important when trying to take out fast moving armour with artillery (see Russian disasters in Vuhledar, Avdiivka and the Siverski  River crossing last July as some great examples) . 

What did we hear at the time through August? Huge reports from the Russians of AFU collapse, destruction of their entire force, routing of troops. etc. etc. so much gloating and crazy claims, every probe that found resistance and retreated was claimed to be the counter offensive and fled before the Russian might....and yet.....and yet.... the firemaps showed slow but steady progression.  artillery strikes hit deeper and deeper into the Russians logistics suggesting further and further forward positions had been secured. There was nothing dramatic in Kherson during August 2022 but there was slow and steady progression tying up the best Russian troops in defence. 

And then in early September 2022 there was suddenly ""No Panic in Balaklia"" 

Unbeknowst to the Russian command a small but well equipped force using fast moving APC's and off road vehicles plus a few tanks had tried a forcing push on a weak point in the Russian line.  They rolled through it even easier than they expected and then after routing the inexperienced forces stationed there, they just kept on rolling, further and further and further and in three days had liberated Izyum, Kupyansk and all the towns in between and were knocking on the doors of Svatove and Kremminna whilst the Russians scrambled to defend.  I don;t think anyone in the AFU command expected them to have the success they did there but it proved that once the line is breached the Russian command structure is not capable of holding it's troops in a fighting withdrawal it turns quickly to rout.   

Why am I writing this?  It's August 2022 all over again.  Ukraine have stated their aims, they are destroying Russian defences and logistics everywhere, they are trying small probing attacks across the front line, looking for weaknesses and slow Russian responses,  they will lose APC's to mines, it's inevitable and if the resistance is strong they will retreat and go again in another position, AFU does not do human meat waves, they care about their troops.  The ridiculous Russian claims have of course started, every reconnaissance in force is claimed to be the counter, and every time they fall back it's ""a rout""  We have clear evidence (firemaps, Oryx visuals lists plus so many more) that every armchair general can find that AFU are quietly carrying out their goals. 

The Bilhorod incursion is similar to the Balaklia attack and has shown a similar weakness in the Russian underbelly.  As it pulls troops from other areas of the frontline you can expect to see more ""no Panics in"" starting to go out on Telegram. 

Ignore the Russian BS, it's very recent history repeating itself.  The proof is right here in these threads we've been following for 400 and something days. We're seeing a repeat of Late August/early September 2022 and I am very much looking forward to seeing the first ""There is no panic in....."" and WarMonitor3's eyes as one town name after another in a totally unexpected location is liberated.",False,1685956688.0,t3_1411ier,t3_1411ier,,0,173,0,173,0,0,

""Ukraine’s Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar has said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that Russia was spreading information about a Ukrainian counteroffensive “to divert attention” from what she said were challenges the invading army faced around Bakhmut in the east.

In Bakhmut – which Maliar said “remained the epicentre” of the fighting – Ukraine is having some “success” as it takes over the “dominant heights” around the city, she claimed.

In her Telegram post, Maliar also said Ukrainian troops are “switching to offensive actions in some directions,” but framed that as part of Ukraine’s overall “defense operation” that began after Russia launched its attempt at a full-scale invasion in February last year.

“We are continuing the defence we started on February 24, 2022. The defense operation contains everything, including counteroffensive actions. Hence, we are switching to offensive actions in some directions,” she said.

Earlier Monday, Maliar and other officials posted a social media video urging silence over any potential news of a counteroffensive.""",False,1685988428.0,t3_1411ier,t3_1411ier,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 05 June 2023.  


* Over the course of May 2023, Russia launched over 300 Iranian Shahed series one way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA-UAVs) against Ukraine: its most intense use of this weapon system to date.  

* Russia is probably launching so many OWA-UAVs in an attempt to force Ukraine to fire stocks of valuable, advanced air defence missiles.  

* Russia is unlikely to have been notably successful: Ukraine has neutralised at least 90% of the incoming OWA-UAVs mostly using its older and cheaper air defence weapons and with electronic jamming.  

* Russia has also likely been attempting to locate and strike Ukrainian forces well behind the front line. However, Russia remains very ineffective at hitting such dynamic targets at range because of its poor targeting processes.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-05-23/index.html

""The United States believes the highly anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive will result in Kyiv taking back ""strategically significant territory,"" Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden's national security adviser, told CNN's Fareed Zakaria.

“Exactly how much, in what places, that will be up to developments on the ground as the Ukrainians get this counteroffensive underway,” Sullivan said. “But we believe that the Ukrainians will meet with success in this counteroffensive.”

Asked if this meant he expected some form of negotiations by the end of this year, Sullivan wouldn’t provide any sort of timetable but said that developments on the battlefield will have a “major impact” on any future negotiation.

“But what I will say is this: President Zelensky himself has said that this war will end ultimately through diplomacy,” Sullivan said.

Western help: Ukraine has delayed its counteroffensive as it awaits the arrival of Western military aid, including modern battle tanks.

Ukrainian forces have already begun training on US Abrams tanks and US officials have previously said they are working to speed up delivery to the battlefield.

Though the US had originally said it would send the newer M1A2 versions of the tanks, officials said in March that the Ukrainians would instead get the M1A1, dramatically accelerating the timeline for their delivery.

In January, Russia's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that Russian forces would destroy US-made M1 Abrams tanks and other NATO military equipment if they are supplied to Ukraine.

""If a decision to transfer to Kiev M1 Abrams is made, American tanks without any doubt will be destroyed as all other samples of NATO military equipment,"" said Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov.

In addition to tanks being provided by the US, Ukraine is also receiving German Leopard 2 tanks and British Challengers.""",False,1685969838.0,t3_1411ier,t3_1411ier,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

💬Soldiers are more open with chaplains than with their commanders, said Colonel Vitalii Skrybets, the head of the Military Chaplaincy Service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

“It is not only about Bakhmut. The offensive is taking place in several directions. We are happy about every meter. Today is a successful day for our forces,” she said.

Earlier, Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app that the country’s troops were “carrying out offensive actions” on the eastern front and had “advanced in several directions” around the city of Bakhmut: near the settlements of Orikhovo-Vasylivka and Paraskoviivka to the north, and near Ivanivske and Klishchiivka to the southwest.

Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, also spoke of “an offensive assault” by the Ukrainians “on the southern and northern flanks of Bakhmut” on national TV on Monday.

“These actions were successful,” Cherevatyi said. “Despite the enemy’s fierce resistance, our airborne assault and mechanised units managed to advance along the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal in the direction of Klishchiivka, Orikhovo-Vasylivka, Zaliznianske, and Bohdanivka to a distance of 300 meters to 1 kilometers in various parts of the front line.”

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-05-23/index.html

""President Joe Biden welcomed Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to the White House for an Oval Office bilateral meeting Monday, calling Denmark “one of our greatest allies and most reliable friends.” 

The president thanked Frederiksen for meeting his granddaughters during their last visit together, who he said, “are still talking about their meeting with the prime minister,” and wished the PM a happy Constitution Day, noting the Danish holiday, “reflects the fact that we have the same values.”

“And together, we’re working together to protect those values, including standing up for the people of Ukraine against the brutal aggression of Russia,” Biden said. “And together with NATO allies, we’re taking steps to strengthen our shared security, including finishing our bilateral defense cooperation agreement that we’re working on.”

The subplot to their conversation about Ukraine and transatlantic security is Frederiksen’s next step.

Frederiksen is widely viewed as a potential contender to replace NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is expected to step down from the post later this year.

The position traditionally goes to a European but would require sign-off by the United States. 

Some European diplomats speculate her visit to the White House is an opportunity for Biden and his team to sound her out about the top NATO job.

Frederiksen has said she isn’t currently in the running to head up the military alliance.

“I am not a candidate for the job,” she told reporters in Copenhagen, according to Reuters.

Still, that hasn’t quieted speculation she may be in a leading position to earn Biden’s endorsement for the job.

Other candidates for NATO Secretary General could include Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. Yet the alliance has never previously been led by a woman.

The White House has declined to say whether Biden will discuss the position with Frederiksen on Monday in the Oval Office.

“I’m just not going to get into any speculation as far as that,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week. 

Instead, White House officials say the two will discuss the war in Ukraine, and Biden’s recent reversal to allow F16 fighter jets into the country as a long-term deterrence to Russian aggression. That conversation will continue Thursday when Biden hosts British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

“One of the things we’ll be looking for their perspectives on and the President will be interested in sharing his perspectives on is the long-term security needs of Ukraine,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said last week. “And that’s really where the F-16s kind of come into this discussion.”""",False,1685997316.0,t3_1411ier,t3_1411ier,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

But, this is what happens.  The reason the US Army took so many casualties at Omaha Beach on D Day is because the Germans were prepared for a landing there.  The geography of the area required that any attack on the Normandy coast would require a landing at that beach, so the Germans fortified the living sh** out of the place.

There will be similar occurrence over the coming weeks and months.  Where Ukraine must take a position, that do to geography, every brain dead Russian commander will know that Ukraine will attack in force.  

The heavy casualties taken in these attacks will not be a sign of failure.  It is simply the job that must be done.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-05-23/index.html

""Belgium said investigations are underway into the possible use of Belgian-made rifles – donated to Ukraine – by Kyiv-aligned forces on Russian territory.

“Defense and the defense intelligence services have started an investigation,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told VRT’s Radio 1 morning show.

“Allow me to not immediately respond ‘what if.’ I first want to first want to have something definite. But this is a serious matter,” he said.

The Washington Post first reported that forces aligned with Ukraine carried Belgian-made FN SCAR rifles during an incursion in Russia’s Belgorod region. Ukraine says it was not directly involved in the attacks, which have been claimed by Russian volunteer groups opposed to the current government in Moscow.

“What we know for sure is that the rules for the supply of our weapons are very strict,” De Croo said on Monday.

“Our weapons – that applies to our country, but applies to all European countries – they are supplied under the condition that they are used for the defense of Ukrainian territory on Ukrainian territory.”

“And so we monitor compliance with those rules very strictly.”

Some background: In May, a group of anti-Putin Russian nationals, who are aligned with the Ukrainian army, claimed responsibility for an attack in Russia's southwestern region of Belgorod, which borders northeastern Ukraine.

On Sunday, the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom for Russia Legion claimed they had captured Russian soldiers and demanded a meeting with the governor of Belgorod.

The groups are not officially part of Ukraine's military but fight under Ukrainian command. They have made several recent incursions in Belgorod that have helped bring the war to Russian soil.""",False,1685970215.0,t3_1411ier,t3_1411ier,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

>Ukrainian defenders continue to protect Ukrainian territories and proceed to counteroffensive actions in some areas of the front. This was stated by Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Malyar.

>""The defensive operation includes everything, including counteroffensive actions. Therefore, in some areas we are moving to offensive actions,"" she wrote.Malyar noted that the epicenter of hostilities remains the Bakhmut direction. There, Ukrainian fighters are moving along a fairly wide front. They achieve success and occupy the dominant heights. At the same time, the Russian occupiers are on the defensive and want to hold their positions.  
>  
>In the south, the enemy is also on the defensive. Fighting of local significance continues there.The deputy defense minister also noted that the occupiers are actively spreading information about the counteroffensive, as they need to divert attention from the defeat in the Bakhmut direction.It will be recalled that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the USA, General Mark Milley, said that the Ukrainian armed forces are at a very good level of preparation for a counteroffensive, but it is still too early to make any predictions.The 467th day of large-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine continues . Russia continues to wage a war of aggression at the cost of heavy losses. Last night, the enemy used Kh-101/Kh-555 air-launched cruise missiles and Iranian Shahed attack drones. The forces and means of the air command, in cooperation with the air defense of other components of the Defense Forces of Ukraine, destroyed four out of six Kh-101/Kh-555 cruise missiles and six out of eight Shahed attack UAVs.",1685975980.0,1685975198.0,t3_1411ier,t1_jmzoy3d,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

He was not in the least bit scared 
To be mashed into a pulp. 
Or to have his eyes gouged out, 
And his elbows broken. 
To have his kneecaps split 
And his body burned away, 
And his limbs all hacked and mangled 
Brave Sir Robin.
His head smashed in 
And his heart cut out 
And his liver removed 
And his bowls unplugged 
And his nostrils raped 
And his bottom burnt off 
And his penis
""That's, that's enough music for now lads, there's dirty work afoot."" 
Brave Sir Robin ran away. 
(""No!"") 
Bravely ran away away. 
(""I didn't!"") 
When danger reared it's ugly head, 
He bravely turned his tail and fled. 
(""I never!"")

And gallantly he chickened out.

He's also not taking into account the fact that the Western allies are currently in the process of ramping up production of supplies and equipment for the Ukrainian warfighters, while Russia is already at their peak and declining as sanctions are stopping necessary equipment from being built to make up for attrition.

The negative modifier on the Russian state of mind is massive, versus the positive modifier in Ukraine where they're fighting for their home, their people and their country is also significant meaning that while Russia has more people, the military strength of Ukraine is significantly higher.

The reason the US Army took so many casualties at Omaha Beach on D Day is because the Germans were prepared for a landing there. The geography of the area required that any attack on the Normandy coast would require a landing at that beach, so the Germans fortified the living sh** out of the place.

D-Day is more about how even with the best of preparations, sometimes you just roll bad dice.

Spies crafted a false-landing site, and many Germans fortified the false site rather than the real landing location. The Atlantic Fleet bombarded the shoreline, while bombers dropped many bombs. All missing their targets (other beaches were properly damaged, but Omaha beach was... fully intact. Not a single shell hit their intended target).

After bombarding the beach significantly (well... really they bombarded the farms way inland... but the commanders didn't know that), US Troops thought it'd be a good time to assault. But just in case the bombardments didn't work, they brought many tanks to the beach.

Most of those tanks sunk to the bottom of the sea due to rough waters. As landing craft piled up, the soldiers got stuck behind the (sunk) tanks and needed to wade onto the shoreline. They then noticed that the bombardments had failed: lots of prepared machine guns shot them all up.

Sometimes, you just get bad luck. Nothing you can do about it. But most people who analyze D-Day / Omaha Beach agree that USA did everything they could to tilt the odds in their favor.


> Because sea conditions were so rough, the decision was made for the 116th LCT to carry the DD tanks of the 743rd Tank Battalion all the way to the beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD tanks of the 741st Tank Battalion were swamped while wading to shore.

Failures cause additional failures, and the fight snowballs out of control. Through shear grit and determination, Americans secured Omaha Beach. But every single part of the plan went wrong.",1685980179.0,1685979988.0,t3_1411ier,t1_jn00ytn,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

If Muscovy has such coverage, why is it still of such low quality.  
If Muscovy has such coverage, why can they not show any identifiable Ukrainian losses.  
Why would Ukraine, who have copious night vision, which Muscovy still lacks, make a meaningful attack in daylight hours.

1. Ukraine hasn't gained any new capability or positioning that would suddenly allow them to destroy the dam now, as opposed to any time in the previous six months.

2. Russia hasn't gained any new advantage or weakness that blowing the dam would allow Ukraine to negate or exploit.

3. Blowing the dam makes it much more difficult for Ukraine to tie down Russian forces through small raids across the river, allowing (in fact, forcing) Russia to relocate forces to other areas.

4. The flooding of the river valley, the draining of the primary freshwater source for Crimea, and the potential meltdown of the ZNPP are all crises primarily affecting civilian populations, and only one side in this war has had almost total disregard for civilian populations since they aren't *their* civilians. 

5. The three crises mentioned above can't be leveraged by Ukraine to get anything they want (more military support) but *can* be used to create political opportunities for Russia: propaganda can be leveraged in attacks against the Ukrainian government, in a call for more recruitment and conscription, and in a worst-case scenario for Russia, to excuse large-scale withdrawals from Ukrainian territory.

Russia uses a common defense strategy called defense in depth, where instead of just keeping all your forces at the front, you have a thinner front with reserve forces that react to any attack to stop a breakthrough.  The weakness to this type of defense is that if the attacker strikes all over the place, the reserves will eventually have to commit and won't be able to react elsewhere.  We might be seeing Leopards/Bradleys/etc once Ukraine decides Russia has committed the reserves elsewhere and the western vehicles form an armored fist to break unsupported defenders, hopefully piecing Russian lines and breaking through.  

Russia knows this and will be hesitant to commit reserves until it thinks its engaging the real Ukrainian strike force.  As a result, we might just get a bunch of gradual pushes by the regular Ukrainian forces.  While Russia gradually looses ground.  We might also see a feigned Ukrainian attack with a fewWestern vehicles to draw in the Russians.

So far, he has been successful. In the second half of the night he began to make movements, creating the impression that he would continue the pressure in the area of yesterday's breakthrough near Velikonovoselovka. Aerial reconnaissance had detected up to 30 armored vehicles moving in the tactical area, but, due to its limited capabilities, could not establish a ""surfacing"" point.

Of course the downfall of this system is that it assumes the world leader has picked the right advisors and those advisors give him truthful and accurate information. If a leader doesn’t trust his advisors or fires/jails them for presenting bad news then that means the quality of information drops substantially and the incentive for those around him to shift blame or be overly optimistic rises. 

Generally the longer someone is in power the harder it is to maintain a grip on reality and this is even more true in authoritarian regimes. Being a world leader of a big nation is inherently isolating and we’re at a point where Putin likely doesn’t have a good grasp on reality. That makes him dangerous but it also means Russia is much more prone to preventable errors and miscalculations which makes them easier to beat.",False,1686017971.0,t3_1411ier,t1_jn2fy7b,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

He was highly motivated from the start to “find” a genocide because, as he notes, his project began by reading the American humorist Mark Twain’s claim that eight to ten million people had died in the EIC. But no scholar has ever made such a charge. His source was a chapter by the Belgian ethnographer Jan Vansina, citing his own work on population declines in the entirety of central Africa throughout the 19th century that included only what became the northern areas of the EIC. In any case, Vansina’s own source was a Harvard study of 1928 that quoted a 1919 Belgian claim that “in some areas” population had fallen by half, but quoted it in order to assert that it was almost certainly false.

The first proper sample-based census was not carried out until 1949, so demographers have to reconstruct population totals from micro-level data on food supply, settlement patterns, village counts, birth records, and the like. The most sophisticated modeling by French and Belgian demographers variously suggests a population of 8 to 11 million in 1885 and 10 to 12 million by 1908. The Belgian Jean-Paul Sanderson, using a backward projection method by age cohorts, found a slight decline, from 10.5 million in 1885 to 10 million in 1910. This estimated change in total population governed by changing birth and death rates over a 25 year period represents a negligible annual net decline in population.

Even taking Sanderson’s pessimistic estimate as correct, does this mean that Léopold’s rule “killed” 500,000 people? Of course not, because, in addition to the misplaced personalization of long-term population changes, the rubber regions, as mentioned, experienced both population increases and declines. ",False,1685974271.0,t3_1411ier,t1_jmzivep,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Tactical positions are the immediate frontline positioning and fighting.  

Tactical reserves are going to be at the company or regimental level and intended to influence these small positional movements.

Operations is about the larger flow of logistics and military structure in the battle space.  Operations is where the real war is often fought, and is much less concerened with individual unit positioning.

Operational reserves are going to be at the regimate to brigade+ level.

Strategic level is where military decisions interact with political goals and objectives.  I.e. winning and losing the war.

From the perspective of an infantry(wo)man sitting in a muddy trench they do not.   Obviously they cannot fall apart before making the flight across the ocean.  Temporary air support is an alternative to temporarily not having support from attack aircraft.  There are large numbers of NATO weapons that can be attached to NATO standard pylons and those weapons are stocked in inventory.

The alternative which was considered was the F/A-18 Hornet.

The way you write it, it sounds like the defenders didnt even try to fight back. It's just that the operation by the German was very well planned, where they used paratroopers to capture key bridges, while also dropping them with gliders so that all artillary pieces and AA guns were destroyed. The Belgian army also had very outdated weaponry at the time, and almost had no tanks, most of which got destroyed fast.

Also, even after the King surrender (which yes, was hated at the end of the war, and caused a crisis where he was not allowed to return as king and had to abdicate), i do believe Ive heard analysis of that concluded that he surrender so the Belgians would be harmed more. Belgium held out for 18 days, and tried to but time for the evacuations in Dunkirk. Iirc, Belgium did refuse English and French troops on it's territory, because at the time, much of Belgium still had to horrors of WW1 in it's mind and didnt want to become yet again the battleground, in which many cities would get completly wiped of the map like for example Passendale did.

The escapes Belgian army and governement also continued fighting against the Germans. Congo, at the time still a colony also stayed loyal to that governement in exile, and fought against Italy in the Africa theatre of the war.

But somehow, you are here trying to pretend like Belgium didnt actually support the alles or something.

> But its the same difference they were originally waiting a 6th gen replacement and now they are going to be using F35 as an interrim (even in smallish numbers) which makes Typhoon obsolete.

Just fyi, not that it changes anything: Germany is *kinda* waiting for a 6th gen fighter, but again the F35 is not replacing the Typhoon at all -  the MOD ordered a total of 35 of those planes, because they're only needed for nuclear bombing runs. Thats a rather insignificant number

In fact, there are currently new Typhoons being produced in Tranche 4 and they're being refitted for ECR and EW as thats the role the Tornado is currently fulfilling without any replacement. Knowing these french-german (or even just german) programs, 2040 is probably way too optimistic and we'll see the FCAS 10-20 years later than planned and until then the Typhoon is the backbone and work horse of the german air force

>...tying to learn to operate two different platforms at the same time and that one might not be able to be operated for very long.

This is the question.  I don't think any one Ukrainian person would learn two aircraft.  Some exceptions if the war is extremely long.  

I am definitely an outsider.  The base I toured in the '80s as a child had US airplanes.  They put two names on the fuselage.   An officer and a sergeant.  That officer flew that aircraft.  The sergeant led the team that maintained that jet.  

General Horner claimed that this was a major factor in the 1991 gulf war.  Giving soldiers personal responsibility for a specific jet put just the right type of pressure on them to make it work.   The sorties per day per plane skyrocketed.  

With 41 jets it means there are several hundred Ukrainian technicians who never learn to work on F-16s.  The F-18 flies out of runways that are too short and rough for F-16s.  That company may never mingle with the other air bases.  Ukrainian infantry have little reason to care about that.   What matters to them is whether the hundreds of men and women would be more helpful as additional infantry reinforcement rather than crew at an airbase.  I find that unlikely though possible.  Ukraine's government keeps saying they need more weapons and ammo not more warm bodies on the front line.  

All 41 jets will eventually be shot down or crash after falling apart.  Then the crews can be enrolled in a second round of F16 maintenance training if there is any need or they can be sent to the front line as infantry reinforcement.   The crews do not die when planes crash.",False,1686017103.0,t3_1411ier,t1_jn2bfk9,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

France in paper actually had a stronger army than Germany even in 1940, but the Germans got the chance to try and improve their tactics with Poland, who was overwhelmed with a long, not very defendable border and both Germany and the USSR attacking. Czechoslovakia had the terrain advantage and Germany still was in the middle of rearming itself, if the French and British actually tried to advance Germany would've been beaten eventually.

2. Well, there's still Moldova. And there's still Georgia. And it doesn't stop with Putin. If Russia is ultimately rewarded with territory because the West just gave up, that's signaling to China they can have whatever they want in Asia because they just have to outlast the West a couple of years and they'll just let you keep it, sanctions or not.

3. Public opinion in Ukraine is heavily in favor of retaking those territories. Of course there are people who want to get out and escape, but those willing to fight must be aided in every way possible so they don't get to die for their country and instead make the russian bastards in front of them die for Putin's dreams

4. Don't be ridiculous, you know you are just being disingenious with that last point. If Ukraine starts losing, they'll just start pumping even more of the good stuff.

A number I found said that Germany had 38 army divisions in fall 1938 (another number said 28 in April). They had 75 when they attacked Poland, and they attacked France with 140 divisions. (In 1943 they peaked at 300 divisions) 

At the time, in 1938, people overestimated the strength of Germany because of Germany's public display of military technology. Just like Russia this time. Had Czechoslovakia, the UK, and France stood up to Germany in 1938, Germany might have backed down. Had Germany not backed down, it's far from clear how such a war would have ended, but probably much better than in 1940.
