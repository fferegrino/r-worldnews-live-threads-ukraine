>The presidents of the five Central Asian countries are in Kyrgyzstan to discuss political and economic cooperation after violent unrest in three countries in the region and a change in attitudes toward Russian influence in the former Soviet countries.  
>  
>...  
>  
>**RFE/RL: Some experts argue that relations between Russia and Kazakhstan have deteriorated in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. Do you see any tension between Moscow and Nur-Sultan?**  
>  
>Brick Murtazashvili: Yes, I think this is really important and it's not just Kazakhstan. \[Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart\] Toqaev came out very strongly and said they wouldn't recognize \[Ukraine’s separatist-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions as independent\]. And Abdulaziz Komilov, Uzbekistan's foreign minister \[at the time\], said the same thing.  
>  
>So, we're seeing both countries really distance themselves from Russia. I think Kazakhstan is doing this much more aggressively than Uzbekistan, but I think Kazakhstan has to do this because its shares this huge border \[with Russia\]. I think, given what President \[Vladimir\] Putin has said about Kazakhstan being sort of an artificial state, Kazakhstan's leaders have very little choice but to distance themselves from this. They fear that their own territorial integrity may be at risk. I wouldn't be surprised to see more of this in the future and I wouldn't be surprised to see Kazakhstan really taking the lead on some of the questions of regional integration.

🪖 On Wednesday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  This doesn’t mean nothing happened and [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1549902738359783425), [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549934199125282816.html) and [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549794087074766848.html) will be happy to lead you through the weeds. 

🍄 As they did on Tuesday, Ukraine again hit the [Antonivs’kyy Bridge](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1549475545284546561) on [Wednesday](https://twitter.com/AP/status/1549677485109006336) — [another video](https://twitter.com/loogunda/status/1549755611335852032).   There was some speculation the bridge was hit with excalibur artillery rounds, but the consensus now does [appear to be HIMARS](https://twitter.com/thedimsol/status/1549794555444207619).  This is one of only two major bridges into Kherson from the East meaning russia soon has to decide [whether to retreat](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549892062274678784.html) from Kherson or try and fjord the Dnipro river on pontoon bridges (recall, russia hasn’t had much luck with river crossings).  With the Antonivs’kyy bridge down for repairs, russians need to travel [100km round trip](https://twitter.com/cjdrew94/status/1549715857823223808) to Nova Khahovka.

👉 russia is having a really tough time fielding enough manpower to prosecute its war in Ukraine.  There’s news coming out of russia that it’s [conscription signups are lagging](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549686694315806720.html), reports hundreds of active fighters are [laying down their arms](https://twitter.com/freekorea_us/status/1549873152364347394) and [demanding to go home,](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549782637346185224.html) and even [this report](https://twitter.com/sebastienroblin/status/1549759136266702850) of russia using troops from halfway around the world, defending the occupied Japanese Kurile Islands.  Meanwhile Ukraine has had no trouble [deploying additional troops](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1549874192329449478) to the Donbas, even while gearing up for an offensive in Kherson.   It does appear that russia keeps warcriming in the occupied territories, [drafting men](https://twitter.com/avalaina/status/1548681345248989186) as cannon fodder.

👉 What troops russia does manage to recruit are sent to the front [with almost no training](https://twitter.com/MoscowTimes/status/1549734576037269507), meanwhile Ukraine troops are being given the best training [the western nations](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1549748006529949696) can provide.

👉 the US has placed russia on the [human trafficking and child soldier list](https://twitter.com/Spring04729692/status/1549950450337583105).  russia has transported thousands of Ukrainian children, often forcibly separated from their parents, and sent them to russia.  To date, only [43 children](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1549929652969508865) have been returned.  Concluding the “russia is an evil country” segment,  russia may face [War Crimes Cases](https://twitter.com/Frankgibsonmad3/status/1549923317720797187) in the [Hague](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549868585107046401.html) by the end of the year.

👉 russias spokesperson Sergey Lavrov said that russia’s objectives now include [south Ukraine](https://twitter.com/cestleiden/status/1549940590422663168).  Since russia is about to lose Kherson in the south this is mostly a bluff for a better bargaining position in peace talks russia wants to force Ukraine into after [russia has annexed](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549711941299470336.html) the occupied territories.  Ukraine, however, is in no mood for peace talks.

👉 On tuesday russia threatened Google, on Wednesday russia [threatened Wikipedia](https://twitter.com/benbvi3ws/status/1549710975808536576) for hosting information about the Ukraine invasion.  Wikipedia is fighting the russian court ruling.

👉 Ukrainian [First Lady Olena Zelenska](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549847784039370754.html) addressed the [US Congress on Wednesday](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549789210579722241.html) and thanked the US for standing with Ukraine [amongst other things](https://twitter.com/ZelenskaUA/status/1549812469467680769).

👉 The US would be open to discussions giving Ukraine its [decommissioned A-10 “Warthog” jets](https://twitter.com/haynesdeborah/status/1549860094774493184).  While the A-10 is a very high-survivability ground attack fighter that excels at eating enemy tanks, its usefulness is questionable without air-superiority.

💰Deputy AG Lisa Monaco says [a Fabergé egg](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1549913344475246592) was found on one of the yachts seized from Russian oligarchs as part of DOJ's KleptoCapture initiative.

The russians have been [shelling Ukrainian positions](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549750470759047169.html) from the Nuclear Power Plant, so yesterday Ukraine hit back with [Loitering Munitions](https://twitter.com/Archer83Able/status/1549760346822508544) (aka Drones).

👉 Corrections: On Tuesday I promoted John Kirby to the US Secretary of Defense, in actuality he is the Coordinator for Strategic Communications for the National Security Council at the Whitehouse.  Additionally, I cited Die Welt in saying the German Chancellor was hindering aid to Ukraine.  I have since learned that Die Welt is a politically motivated magazine akin to Fox News in the states and so the article may have a substantial bias.

Day 148 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The day, again, started with shelling of residential districts, this time they shelled Barabashovo market, killing 3 people and injuring over 20 more. This market is really big, with about 16000 stores in it, and it’s always packed full of civilians, you can’t hide anything military related there even if you wanted to, but they still shelled it, and it’s not the first time they did it either, with the explicit goal of killing civilians.

Today is the 4th day in a row that Kharkiv wasn’t hit by their missiles. They started to mostly target towns in Kharkiv oblast; apparently today they hit something in Rohan, after which the electricity went out. They are also definitely limiting their missile use; only 2 missiles were fired today, and they fired them at 2am, they are not really following any schedule anymore.

And also the clowns from the Russian MOD again spouted another load of bullshit about Kharkiv today. This time they said that there’s a base and an ammo depot in the university I study at. Now, they say that same thing about a lot of other places, and they rarely hit them, but still, don’t you fucking dare destroy it, Russia. They are really fighting a war against educational institutions, but so far they losing miserably.

Russia has yet to take out any of the Western rocket artillery donated to Ukraine, according to the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley. This comes as Russia claims that they had hit HIMARS near the front line. 

""To date the HIMARS that we have provided them – and we're not the only country by the way, other countries are providing long range fires as well, Britain, for example, and some others are donating long range rocket artillery – to date those systems have not been eliminated by the Russians,"" he said after the fourth meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday, a platform which includes 50 countries from all continents.

Milley went on to detail how Ukraine was putting the donated rocket systems to use.

""The Ukrainians are effectively employing these HIMARS strikes against Russian command and control nodes, their logistical networks, their field artillery and air to find sites and many other targets,"" Milley told journalists in DC. ""The Ukrainians have excellent artillery soldiers, excellent gunners as the British would call them and they're being very, very effective.""

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov acknowledged the praise that Ukraine has received from the US and other allies on its use of the donated multiple launch rocket systems, such as the HIMARS.

""I would like to note that the American partners and as well as colleagues from other countries expressed their admiration for the skill of our soldiers, including the way they use artillery and HIMARS,"" Reznikov said.

The minister said these Western donated weapons were ""already affecting the course of the war.""

In his review of the meeting, Reznikov also said the Ukraine Defense Contact Group had been presented with an overview of the situation in the battlefield, which, he claimed, showed Russia had suffered significant losses in terms of manpower and equipment. 

""These are impressive numbers which prove that Ukraine is indeed the shield of Europe,"" he said. ""It is important that this overview was prepared specifically by the partners based on their data and evaluations.""

***Ukraine says it destroyed 6 Russian ammunition dumps and struck scores of other targets in the south.***

""Ukraine’s military said on Thursday that it had used attack helicopters and fighter jets to pound Russian ammunition dumps and other positions in the south of the country over the past 24 hours, as part of a counteroffensive to reclaim territory.  
  
In all, Ukraine conducted 10 airstrikes using helicopters and fighter jets in and around Kherson Province, which Russian forces seized in March. Across the region, they attacked more than 200 targets using long-range missiles and artillery, officials said.  
  
The military claimed to have blown up six ammunition depots, five troop strongholds and several command posts. There was no independent confirmation of the statement although some of the strikes were captured on video.  
  
The gathering scale of Ukraine’s attacks in the south is consistent with preparations for a ground offensive because they put pressure on Moscow’s military infrastructure and supply lines. The south is economically and strategically significant because it contains Ukraine’s agricultural heartland, and its vital ports and provides a land link between Crimea and Russia.  
  
In recent weeks, Ukraine has made use of long-range artillery supplied by Western countries including the United States to strike targets deeper behind the front lines. The weapons are helping to counter Russia’s military might but Ukraine is far from having the scale of forces Russia can wield.""",False,1658429746.0,t3_w46qzm,t3_w46qzm,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 21 July 2022
 
- Russian and separatist forces continue to attempt small scale assaults along the Donbas front line. Russian forces are likely closing in on Ukraine's second biggest power plant at Vuhlehirska, 50km north-east of Donetsk.

- Russia is prioritising the capture of critical national infrastructure, such as power plants. However, it is probably also attempting to break through at Vuhlehirska, as part of its efforts to regain momentum on the southern pincer of its advance towards the key cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.

The biggest indicators of Ukraine's estimates being more correct or CIAs being conservative is Russia's desperate attempts to recruit people and hastily send them to the front. It is also indicated by general Russian adjustment of goals and focus.

US directly meddled in Ukraine during the events of the Maidan and before it to make Ukraine a pro-American, pro-Nato country.

Friendly reminder that regardless of the history being written in a more romantic fashion, maidan in 2014 never had the support of the majority of Ukrainians (more people opposed it than supported it), that Victoria Nuland was inciting protesters and giving them cookies telling them to overthrow a democratically-elected government, as well as appointing the interim government for the post Yanukovich while McCain was parading in Kiev with questionable people and Biden's son was misteriously appointed to the board of directors of Ukraine's biggest gas company.

In April 2021 Biden was promoting the same Nuland to Secretary of Political Affairs, sending more weapons and money to Ukraine than Obama and Trump combined as well as sending US military forces to train Ukraine. At the same time Zelensky started getting bolder and bolder with his speeches and intentions of retaking the lost territories, break the ceasefire and broke the Minsk agreements by ramping up heavy weaponry in Donbas.

US did a lot to meddle in Ukraine and has had its share of responsibility playing geopolitical chess being played down there and we know merely the tip of the iceberg, but if you believe that US intelligence and diplomacy didn't their best into using Ukraine to weaken its links to Russia you're blind.

I'm not gonna say this is new, and it has been happening for decades, not just by US, and not gonna say that justifies the military intervention and annexations in Ukraine.

People there are very traditional and insular, thanks to a shitty education and language that nobody else speaks. Even if you speak the language, you are not trusted if you are from the city and any real (or perceived) misstep (such as not using the proper honorific when greeting someone) you make in their social rules will immediately have everyone talking shit about you. Add to that the effects of religion and irredentism and you have a population rife for exploitation by opportunists who keep them ignorant and poor and then buy their votes come election time. It kind of boggles my mind though that Fidesz politicians get caught in gay orgies and the rural traditionalists still vote for them.",False,1658422938.0,t3_w46qzm,t1_ih2j0ug,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

But do they have the tools to win those fights *decisively* and without a large cost to their ability to continue projecting power forward? At the moment, I think so, at least to an extent. But the more time that goes by, the less confidence I have that Ukraine can win those fights *and* retain the ability to continue moving forward.

This is, I believe, why a major offensive to retake Kherson hasn't begun just yet, despite the board seemingly being set up to do so. If one were to look at the Russians in Donetsk, they are so focused on obtaining a piece of territory *now* that they expend an inordinate amount of resources per square kilometer gained, and this leaves the next square kilometer to be that much more difficult, which is the entire reason it is assessed that Russia will ""run out of steam"", as it were. If Ukraine falls into a similar situation, they will end up with a highly militarized line of contact just like the Minsk boundary where neither side is capable of offensive movement, and this will again create a de-facto border that Russia can exploit. It doesn't even matter that Russia can't legally annex the territory or that the international community won't recognize it. This did not stop them from doing the same to Crimea. Observers may not like it, but without a way to physically extricate Russia from the territory, it will, on the ground, belong to Russia. 

The calculus on Ukraine's side, then, must be, ""How do we retake this particular piece of territory at minimal cost?"" And this takes into consideration, I'm sure, that a longer wait will result in tougher gains. The balance of how much time it takes to plan versus how much time you can afford to wait will dictate when they act, but explicitly with regard to Kherson I suspect that window of action between the two must be sooner rather then later.",False,1658425374.0,t3_w46qzm,t1_ih2n3hw,,4,5,0,5,0,0,

I'm not saying Ukrainians are about to easily recapture everything here, the Russian artillery advantage (even with diminished logistics due to HIMARS) is still there.

I think it makes more sense to ""let"" the Russians do whatever entrenchment strategies they think they can do, while instead Ukraine gets better weapons (what comes next after these HIMARS?). I feel like Ukrainian strength grows faster than any defense Russia can mount at this point. Especially because the Russians are so obviously missing out on the basics of entrenchment (IE: Concrete barriers at important locations).

It seems like the Russian focus is upon attacking still, which is good for Ukraine in the great scheme of things. Instead of entrenching, the Russian forces continue to attack, weakening themselves.

> Also part of the reason Yanukovich won was because he promised he'd take steps to join the EU but then proceeds to back-flip on this to get closer to Russia.

Another misconception.

It was the Ukrainian parliament that refused to sign the EU trade deal, not the president. The president ratified it.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/21/ukraine-suspends-preparations-eu-trade-pact

The reason? Russia offered cheap gas and 15B in loans. The EU proposed 850M in loans and had a long list of reforms they demanded half of which the parliament refused. It was a question of money, the deal with Russia was more favorable and Russia was the biggest import/export partner of Ukraine and they could not afford to lose that money over ideological reasons of ""getting closer to EU"". The EU deal was shit for Ukraine, plain and simple.

https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-promises-ukraine-cheaper-gas-15-billion-loan/1811836.html

But those parts are never really mentioned in the ""propaganda"" we get of ""evil corrupted pro Russian president refusing a deal all Ukrainians wanted"". The financial part of it is never mentioned, conveniently.

Also, another misconception is that Yanukovich seeked closer ties to Russia. In fact, in Russia Yanukovich was considered a ""traitor"" when he was president because he did not seek those closer ties.

1) He opposed joining the custom union with Russia and Belarus.

2) He opposed joining a military alliance with Russia and Belarus.

3) He re-negotiated a very bad gas deal that his predecessor, Yulia Tymoshenko, former ministry of energy and wife of the former ceo of the biggest gas company in Ukraine signed with Russia which was very expensive for Ukraine. Yanukovich got a 30% cheaper deal. Tymoshenko was accused of taking bribes from Gazprom to sign the deal, the EU considered the sentence politically-motivatred.

> He lost his popular support completely and was very unpopular during that time.

Only true in western Ukraine at the time of the failed agreement.

> He lost his popular support completely and was very unpopular during that time.

Peaceful protesters that stormed government buildings since the very beginning of the protests?

> Not to mention the fact that the status quo before that was Russia influenced politics up and down the system. Something you guys never fucking talk about so really the west is clean compared to the other actor involved in this.

Russia **should have** took out a lot of planes in the first few days. We all saw the missile salvo in the opening days and thought of the worst.

It has become abundantly clear that Russia did not achieve many goals however. As the war dragged on, it became obvious that Russian missiles are inaccurate and probably missed many, many targets.

His party decided that in parliament. The same party that famously has ties to Russia.

His decisions making around it doesn't change the fact he reneged on his election promise. To take cheap loans in exchange for more Russian influence in Ukraine. This is besides the fact that EU has reforms tied to its loans and membership status is very well known. You have to be willing to play by the rules if you one day wish to join. I mean you boil it down to two loan options but the reality is so much bigger then that and to draw a conclusion you must consider this. Fact is they traded EU membership and far more money long term for a single loan of 17b from Russia.

> Also, another misconception is that Yanukovich seeked closer ties to Russia. In fact, in Russia Yanukovich was considered a ""traitor"" when he was president because he did not seek those closer ties.

Facts are facts, painting the maidan as something that all or most Ukrainians wanted is simply false. It was the very opposite of democracy and openly supported in a biased fashion only in one direction.

Imagine being leader of a country where part of your population wants to impose their will in a non-democratic way against the will of the majority.

Those are the facts of what happened, so quit that narrative and false belief that Ukrainians supported the events, because the opposite is even more true and this is never mentioned. It's not the way the maidan has ever been painted to western audiences.

Got any evidence behind this claim? Seems ridiculous to me.

Look man, you're not gonna convince me.

If you want to say that Russia has treated Ukraine as a vassal state I agree, if you want to say that Russia heavily meddled, influenced and spread different propaganda in Ukraine, I agree. If you want to say that most Ukrainians wanted closer ties to Europe, again, I agree. I've followed the events, I've seen the polls, I know this is factually true. They looked at how Poland or Lithuania evolved after USSR felt, and they looked at the dire state of their country. If you want to say that what Russia has done, especially since 2014, in Ukraine is vomit-worthy, again, I agree.

I am in no way denying Russia has the biggest responsibilities for Ukraine's disaster reasons and is de facto the boogeyman, again, I agree.

But if you want to spin and support the false idea that the maidan was a good thing for Ukraine (a country that has never financially recovered from pre 2013 levels) and that it was a honest rebellion against a pro Russian puppet supported by the population I don't.

Tha part I cannot agree with because it's a false cherrypicked narrative.

What should've happened in 2013/2014 is that Ukraine and Ukrainians alone, not Russians, not Americans, should've sorted their problems in a peaceful and democratic manner and settled it possibly at the following elections.

You were being totally disingenuous though because its the first steps towards EU membership. Everyone is aware of that. 

It definitely is when you've been saying you'll do that then choose not to. Like I said it had larger consequences as a first step towards memebership. To say otherwise is flat out lying.

I'm not speculating. Its literally the process all other nations have gone through for membership ascendancy. Closer incremental trade agreements and regulations. Youre being ridiculous now.


It was largely peaceful infact considering history and even current revolutions it is extremely peaceful but that doesn't suit your narrative. 

You educate yourself on the parts that agree with you. Infact you ignore widely accepted truths to keep this narrative true.

The thing is you say you agree to that but you chose to single out the US above in your original comment when Putin was doing a far worse version of it. Especially when the comment replied to was talking about Putin. You have an agenda. You literally brought this all up unprompted",1658403718.0,1658403454.0,t3_w46qzm,t1_ih1cnc8,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

No, I've never done that, I clicked submit before finishing the comment but you already had answered. You don't need to assume ill fate, especially on something so trivial.

> Everyone is aware of that.

The only thing that matters are facts and what's written black on white. Of course the EU trade agreement was a step towards a potential EU membership, I've never said the opposite.

But you don't make a terrible trade deal which fucks you up financially in hope that this may lead 10/20 years later after many radical changes, economical improvements and lots of reforms especially when the agreement leads do worse economy which is a requirement towards EU membership.

You can also make these reforms and improve your economy, cut the corruption that has always plagued Ukraine (Yanukovich, his predecessors and also his successors all have been highly accused of corruption and cronyism, including Panama papers revelations) and postpone or negotiate a better deal.

> The thing is you say you agree to that but you chose to single out the US above in your original comment when Putin was doing a far worse version of it.

The previous comment said that the only element behind US meddling was Putin's words, there's much more substance behind it and I pointed it out. I've never ever stated Russia was doing less of it, in fact I have said the opposite on multiple occasions.

There's few things that me and you differ:

- I think that the Maidan was a coup against a fairly and democratically elected government, and that western countries with US on the forefront had a huge role in its support and spreading. Imagine if during July 6th half of world leaders was supporting the protesters in Washington.

- That the Maidan was not reflecting the opinion of a larger part of the population and it was anti-democratic, but that's not the way it is narrated.

- That the failure of the trade deal was merely a reflection of how bad of a deal it was for Ukraine, already the poorest economy in Europe by GDP per capita, and it was not motivated by a sudden change in direction by the parliament and president for ideological reasons. If they didn't want to sign it in the first place, they would've not worked for years towards it.

It should also be noted, that from 2014 till now, even after the Maidan. the whole integration with EU still has never worked well for Ukraine. Ukraine got a total of 5 billions in loans since 2014, much less than what Russians offered. Of those, 4.1 billions only arrived after the war had started in the latest months. So what did the Maidan achieve with that coup? What has been the help that Ukrainians received? They couldn't even enter Europe till february without a visa and all of Europe treated the Ukrainian issue before the war as merely a Polish problem. Doesn't look to me like Yanukovich and its party did the wrong thing back then taking a deal taht was bad and confirmed to be bad in time even when very pro-EU parties took power.

I don't disagree with the notion of the Maidan being largely peaceful by the way and that it was violently repressed as well.

> Infact you ignore widely accepted truths to keep this narrative true.

Because plenty of the ""widely accepted truths"" are not truths at all, but are based on partial and biased narratives.

> The thing is you say you agree to that but you chose to single out the US above in your original comment when Putin was doing a far worse version of it.

Because the comment was that US meddling was all in Putin's immagination.

What we agree on is that:

- We both think that Russia has been the boogeyman in Ukraine. I'm not disagreeing at all and I have no sympathy for a man who bombed his own citizens in 1999 to motivate a war to gain popularity (see 1999 Moscow Bombings)

- We both think that Ukrainians, most of them wanted to integrate in various ways/steps into the EU. I've never said the opposite. But wanting to integrate in the EU does not also imply supporting overthrowing a democratically elected government, it implies voting someone else at the next elections if you feel your representatives have failed you.

What I cannot accept is misinformation being spread and biased narratives because that's how the maidan has largely been sold.

Who doesn't learn from history is bound to repeat it. We have failed in Ukraine, multiple times, we have failed at dealing with Russia, multiple times. Today's news is a reflection of our failures at making the world a peaceful place and appeasing authoritarian regimes and buying into propaganda and narratives rather than facts.",1658411319.0,1658409145.0,t3_w46qzm,t1_ih1d9s3,,4,0,0,0,0,0,
