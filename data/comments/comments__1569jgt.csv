fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,1569jgt,jt19vn2,"Day 509-514 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last few days have been pretty quiet here, there were no missile strikes from Belgorod, but as always, many towns in Kharkiv oblast that are close to the border/frontline are still being shelled every day. Shelling is something that just never stops unlike missile strikes, which are pretty rare now, especially in our region.

I guess Russians new favorite target is food, because that‚Äôs pretty much all they‚Äôve been targeting after the Crimean bridge was blown up. As usual Russians managed to find a way to sink even lower than before, it‚Äôs like they are competing for the title of the worst country on Earth, and apparently, they are very serious about getting it. Trying to cause global famine is a good way to make enemies out of your remaining ‚Äúallies‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt really see how that is going to help them win the war.

Them striking port infrastructure and food warehouses in Odesa is definitely not a ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù for the Crimean bridge like they were saying. It was already planned long before the bridge was hit because they were going to leave the grain deal anyway. The targets and bombers were prepared in advance, they were ready to strike as soon as the grain deal expired and they would have done it even if we didn‚Äôt hit the bridge. Saying that it was a response to the bridge attack is just a convenient excuse for them to attack civilian targets, and I bet that there are a lot of people that believed them, which is a shame.  

It's pretty interesting that Girkin was arrested, many people always said that he was a Russian psy-op that just says what the western audience wants to hear, but since they arrested him, he probably wasn‚Äôt actually saying what the Kremlin wanted to hear. His constant doom-posting appears to have been genuine this whole time, the only question is why they haven‚Äôt arrested him earlier, after all he has been ‚Äúdiscrediting Russian army‚Äù this whole time, which is a crime over there. I guess him recently attacking Putin directly was what triggered them this time, maybe he even gave the order to arrest him directly.",False,1690055051.0,t3_1569jgt,t3_1569jgt,,0,185,0,185,2,0,{'gid_3': 1}

His company has been serving Russian law enforcement structures and controlled by them for a long time.

Russian former intelligence officer and leading nationalist mil-blogger Igor Girkin was almost certainly arrested for ‚Äòextremism‚Äô on 21 July 2023.

Girkin has long been a critic of the Russian Ministry of Defence‚Äôs conduct of the war. However, in recent days his comments turned to direct criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his time in power.

The move is likely to infuriate fellow members of the mil-blogger community - and elements within the serving military - who largely see Girkin as an astute military analyst and patriot.

He played a major role in Russia‚Äôs war in the Donbas from 2014 and spent months on the front line in 2022.

While Girkin is no ally of the Wagner Group, he was likely only prepared to push the limits of public criticism in the context of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin‚Äôs June 2023 abortive mutiny. The taboo against unmasked criticism of the Putin regime has significantly weakened.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-22-23/index.html

""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the Ukrainian army's ongoing counteroffensive is expected to ""gain pace"" after a slow start.

Speaking to the Aspen Security Forum on Friday, Zelensky blamed the slow progress on the operation having started later than expected, as well as a lack of munitions.

‚ÄúWe did have plans to start it in spring, but we didn't, because frankly, we had not enough munitions and armaments and not enough properly trained brigades ‚Äî I mean, properly trained in these weapons,‚Äù Zelensky said.

‚ÄúBecause we started a bit late, it can be said ‚Äî and it‚Äôs the truth, shared by all experts ‚Äî that it provided Russia ... the time to mine all our land and build several lines of defense,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúDefinitely they had a bit more time than they needed because of that they built all of those lines. And really, they had a lot of mines on our fields because of that a slower pace of our counter offensive actions,‚Äù Zelensky explained. 

The Ukrainian president said despite the difficulties, his countrymen were making progress.

‚ÄúWe didn't want to lose our people, our personnel and our servicemen, we didn't want to lose equipment and because of that, they were quite careful about the offensive actions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would say that we are approaching a moment when relevant actions can gain pace because we are already going through some mine locations and we are demining these areas.‚Äù

Zelensky's words came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the West is disappointed with the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

‚ÄúIt is obvious that the Western curators of the Kiev regime are clearly disappointed with the results of the so-called counter-offensive,‚Äù Putin said Friday, using the Russian name for Ukraine‚Äôs capital.

Some background: Since the Ukrainian counteroffensive began in June, the fighting has proved tougher than some anticipated, with progress being measured in hundreds of meters as opposed to tens of kilometers.

Ukraine had hoped to use the push to expel a significant amount of Russian forces from Ukrainian soil and turn the tide of the war.""",False,1690033192.0,t3_1569jgt,t3_1569jgt,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

Another matter is the border between Poland and the Baltic states, in particular, the Suwa≈Çki Gap, which is so tempting for Russia. Russia's hybrid aggression against NATO with the help of the ""little gray men"" fits perfectly into the strategy of raising the stakes to pressure allies to influence support for Ukraine. The readiness of NATO countries to fight back against the armed group is currently unclear, and uncertainty is perceived by Russia as a weakness and is fuel for provocations. The solution is simple: the immediate provision of weapons to Ukraine to destroy the enemy on the territory of Ukraine today literally ensures peace in Europe. Of course, Eastern Europe knows this very well. But the further other capitals are from Russia, the more often we have to remind this.""

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-22-23/index.html

""While Russian forces mount an essentially defensive operation in the south of Ukraine, they've adopted a more offensive posture elsewhere along the front line, according to updates from Kyiv's military, regional leaders and Russian bloggers.

In Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region, in particular, Moscow‚Äôs troops appear to have Ukraine firmly on the back foot.

‚ÄúYesterday the enemy tried to advance almost along the entire front line (running through the Luhansk region). These attempts were stopped by our military. The enemy is suffering significant losses in personnel and means but is pressing on every day,‚Äù Artem Lysohor, head of the region's military administration, said on Telegram Saturday.

Lysohor listed five locations in Luhansk where Russian forces had recently attacked.

A Ukrainian army spokesperson reminded TV viewers that Russia has assembled 100,000 soldiers to the east of an area between the towns of Lyman and Kupyansk. The towns are about 100 kilometers (62 miles) apart, north of Bakhmut on the eastern front.

‚ÄúAlthough the situation is complicated, it is under our control,‚Äù said Serhii Cherevatyi, the military spokesperson.

‚ÄúThe enemy is acting according to the classic scheme ‚Äî they are conducting artillery and air strikes on our positions to the maximum extent possible. And then they try to attack with platoon-company-level units ‚Ä¶ trying to attack our positions,‚Äù Cherevatyi added.

Reports from Russia: Rybar, a Russian military blogging site, says Moscow's forces have made territorial gains in the northeastern Kharkiv region, capturing a railway station in the village of Movchanove and expanding control around the nearby town of Lyman Pershyi.

It is not possible for CNN to immediately verify claims of battlefield gains or losses by either side, but it is notable that the DeepState mapping site also suggests modest Russian gains in the same area.

Also in the east, Ukrainian forces continue their efforts to capture higher ground around Bakhmut, but gains are small and hard to defend, according to reports.

Rybar reported the Ukrainian army has ""once again managed to gain a foothold on the heights"" near the town of Klishchivka, just south of Bakhmut. But, the Russian site reported, it had come ‚Äúat the cost of significant losses.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Ukrainian defense forces are holding the initiative (around Bakhmut), putting pressure on the enemy, and liberating Ukrainian land meter by meter,‚Äù Cherevatyi said.""",False,1690033473.0,t3_1569jgt,t3_1569jgt,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

da2a4b22a693ee85c3243986243d57db,1569jgt,jt1og82,"I would like to share a theory about the whole Putin-Prigozin fiasco and how it might be a way for Putin to use tactical nuclear missiles against Ukraine. For simple I will use point form;

1. Putin knows he and the Russian army cannot quickly end war so he starts planning his moves. First he needs to throw soldiers at Ukraine that Russians will not be upset about losing therefore he brings in the Wagner mercenaries. They are slaughtered on the eastern front and Putin puts his strategy in play. He moves Russian nuclear missiles into puppet state of Belarus.
2. Prigozin makes lots of noise about how badly supplies are and that military leadership is incompetent. He Then puts on a fake rush to Moscow as if attempting a coup, red herring. For this Putin sends Prigozin and Wagner mercenaries into Belarus calling it an exile from Russia. Now Putin has his rogue army in Belarus with the Russian nuclear missiles. Remember Putin said there were no longer a Wagner group in Russia and I believe he said they no longer exist, in other words not Russian citizens or soldiers
3. Guessing now, but under some false pretext Prigozin as a Russian nationalist is going to stage a takeover of the command of the Russian nuclear missiles for whatever drummed up reason. Now Putin has controlled use of tactical nuclear use without his or Russian soldier pushing the button, complete deniability.

I seriously hope this is all wrong but it scares me very much that these two psychopathic people could start the use of nuclear weapons and put the world at war or ........

Ukraine‚Äôs president Volodymyr Zelenskyy insisted his military‚Äôs counteroffensive against Russian forces was about to ‚Äúgain pace‚Äù, as he sought to reassure western governments that have grown alarmed at the slow progress of the operation.
The weeks-old effort to push back Russian forces in Ukraine had begun later than Kyiv had hoped, said Zelenskyy, due to insufficient munitions, armaments and properly trained brigades, which had given Russia time to lay mines and build defensive lines.
But momentum on the front was about to shift, Zelenskyy added, while reiterating his call for allies to supply more long-range missiles and advanced fighter jets.

‚ÄúWe are approaching a moment when relevant actions can gain pace because we are already going through some mines locations and we are demining these areas,‚Äù he said.
The Ukrainian leader was speaking by video to international security leaders at the four-day Aspen Security Forum, where the pace of Ukraine‚Äôs counteroffensive to push back Russian forces in eastern and southern Ukraine dominated discussions.
The progress of the counteroffensive was ‚Äúthe question in the minds of everyone here‚Äù and ‚Äúthe preoccupation of all of your friends in the world‚Äù, Chrystia Freeland, Canada‚Äôs deputy prime minister told Zelenskyy.
Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, told the audience in Colorado that the results of Ukraine‚Äôs military effort would only become clear once Kyiv had fully committed its forces.

‚ÄúIt is at that moment when they make that commitment that we will really see what the results of the counter offensive will be,‚Äù Sullivan said.
Sullivan added that Ukrainian emphasis on securing supplies of advanced fighter jets for the counteroffensive was misplaced, because strong Ukrainian and Russian air defences had prevented air power from playing a significant role in the conflict, Sullivan said.¬†
‚ÄúThe view of our military commanders is that the notion that F-16s would play a decisive role in this counteroffensive given that fundamental reality‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚ÄâThey have a different view than what you have heard from some Ukrainian voices,‚Äù he said.
While officials projected an upbeat outlook for Ukraine‚Äôs military progress in public, many were less sanguine in private.

‚ÄúThe bad news is Ukrainians are moving towards what could be a winter of discontent,‚Äù said Philip Zelikow, a history professor at the University of Virginia and former diplomat. He pointed to the severe economic impact of the war and the already steep cost borne by the US and other allies to keep Kyiv‚Äôs government afloat.
UK foreign secretary James Cleverly told the Financial Times that the mismatch between Ukrainian expectations and western commitments was understandable because the west had other priorities while Ukraine had a singular focus.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be a slight difference of approach between the Ukrainian leadership and other countries, in terms of what we want to achieve.‚Äù
Biden administration officials‚Äô frustration with criticisms from Ukraine and other Nato allies about the pace and kind of assistance the US is providing was palpable.

Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, said the Biden administration had been too slow to send systems such as main battle tanks and cluster munitions that ultimately made their way to the battlefield.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of hearing about escalation. Stop talking about escalation. If you don‚Äôt escalate, you‚Äôre gonna lose,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want [Vladimir] Putin to wake up in the morning worried about what he‚Äôs going to do that‚Äôs gonna cause us to escalate instead of us wringing our hands.‚Äù
Sullivan dismissed what he described as ‚Äúcaricatures‚Äù of American decision-making, including notions that the Biden administration was ‚Äúsitting around unwilling to provide things because we‚Äôre worried about the Russians‚Äù.
The ‚Äúsheer magnitude‚Äù of American assistance made it clear that the US was ‚Äúprepared to take risk and we will continue to be prepared to take risk to provide support to Ukraine‚Äù, Sullivan said.
He also hit back at critics who said worrying about Russian nuclear escalation was a sign of weakness.

Transcript of the bit:

""Who are you?

All these Strelkov-Girkins, Gubarevs, Podolyakas, Montyans? Who are you to be pointing to us what Putin, MoD, and others should be like? Who are you?

We already survived Navalny, Yashin, and other scum. And we will survive you, believe me. We have a very strong immunity.

But the question is, who are you? I realise that Navalny‚Äôs network didn‚Äôt go anywhere. And the smelly fascists are hiding in holes. All this scum, the Black Hundreders, monarchists, all this badly smelling mess with a very strong inclination towards fascism.

They all exist, including Navalnists, and as soon as something catches fire they come for the smell.

You know, as soon as a compost pile appears, the flies are already there, yelling ‚ÄúShame, shame!‚Äù, coming out to the protest events. Who are you to call for protests in Moscow?

Look at their telegram channels - half of them are [slur for Ukrainians]. What‚Äôs happening in their comments? It‚Äôs just beautiful.

I think that what‚Äôs happening now is very characteristic. I think they all need to get ready. All the people in this network, the patriotic-literature gopniks, they need to watch carefully. I‚Äôd recommend them to visit a solicitor and just in case organise their property: ‚ÄúIn case if I‚Äôm [arrested]‚Ä¶‚Äù and so on.

Or maybe buy tickets, somewhere to Tbilisi. It‚Äôs just the right time. Because the clearing of the space is beginning.

And they think they have the right! Strelkov was arrested, but he‚Äôs a ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù! Do patriots have indulgences? Can they throw mud at anyone they want?

They‚Äôre not defending Strelkov, they‚Äôre defending themselves and their fundraisers. It might soon end and even Kashevarova [Russian female blogger] will be washing toilets in Duma. The only thing she knows how to do and always did. And offer tea: ‚ÄúHello, please, it‚Äôs warm‚Äù.

That‚Äôs all they know how to do. They didn‚Äôt become the Counts of Monte Cristo, they‚Äôll have to retrain, to not even become site managers but site cleaning managers.

I emphasise again - we need a total clearing, brutal military censorship. Any fundraisers only via state resources.

But again - get ready, all the graphomaniacs and mediocrities, lovers of military coups, Maidans and all that. We won‚Äôt allow a Maidan.""",False,1690039811.0,t3_1569jgt,t1_jt00zkp,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

They said that Putin's goal is likely to take as much as he can, before Ukraine gets enough western hardware to drive Russia out so that when the time comes, he can try to hold at least Crimea. Remember, Escalate to Deescalate.

Recently, I think it was Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Russia's central bank said a lot of the tools they used to prop up Russia's economy are being exhausted. Maybe it was some other economic high up in Russia. 

Furthermore, Ukraine is now getting long range fires they have needed, reports of rebellious units, second kerch bridge attack, Kupyansk offensive making little progress, Ukraine's counteroffensive slowly clawing back land and so on. 

My arm chair general theory is that Putin is preparing the information space for Russia to reopen negotiations, and offer/sacrifice Russia's current gains, and the Donbas they took in 2014 so that he can retain Crimea. 

Putin is probably counting on the horrible poll numbers of Biden and the SPD to force the US and Germany to force a quick peace so the war doesn't drag into 2024 (US) and 2025 (Germany) election years. Obviously I and Ukraine disagrees with this take, but Putin probably thinks he can keep Crimea.

First small changes, little more in September, even little more in October, than complete failure for  Russia.

This year so far is the same. One part is different, it is not only Kherson. It is Kherson left  bank, Zaporizhia, Donetsk, up to Bakhmut. Small but steady advances.

&#x200B;

* In Bakhmut Ukraine got control over the heights around Bakhmut rendering fire control over the city. Ukraine can now put real pressure on poor Russian soldiers in the occupied city. Putin will never let them retreat but fill up the losses with fresh ""meat"" to the Bakhmut cauldron. 
* Vital pushes in the south starts to endanger Russian supply routs. Ukraine hits on daily bases so far south as Berdiansk. Russian land based supply lines is in danger.
* Kerch bridge is hit again. Russian officials recommends the land based route. See the  above bullet. Closed two time today.
* Almost 700 Russian artillery pieces destroyed last month alone. Many trained artillery men dead. Numerous reports from Russian soldiers lacking artillery support. Bring 700 new artillery pieces back to front and train new men is not sustainable.
* Uptick of destroyed Russian AA the last 3 weeks.
* Some 4000 soldiers liquidated the last month. With a slight uptick last days. How many wounded? How many surrendered? How many who contract run out?
* Hits on vital train hubs, the one north of Crimea was huge including the ammo depot. Hitting bridges, hitting ammo depots, hitting fuel depots. All more frequent than before.  
Today deep in Crimea ammo depot & fuel depot. Yesterday another deep Crimea strike, on missile dept.
* Hitting command posts. More high ranking officers liquidated now than in a long time.

Other factors:

* Coup attempt, making Putin & Kremlin revealing how week they are.
* More critics towards Kremlin & Putin gets arrested. Eg terrorist Igor Girkin / Strekov, Commanders, high ranking officers. 
* Russia's Central Bank made statements on the weak Russian economy.
* New types of weapons, more weapons, more ammunition delivered to Ukraine.
* Sweden Closer to NATO, so is Ukraine.
* More sanctions, more sanctions towards those who help Russia evade sanctions.

The tradition of Ded Moroz is mostly spread in East Slavic countries and is an important part of Russian culture. At the beginning of the Soviet era, communist authorities banned Ded Moroz. Nevertheless, he soon became an important part of the Soviet culture. The literal translation of Ded Moroz is Grandfather Frost.


>Ded Moroz is very popular in modern Russia. In 1998, the town of *Veliky Ustyug in Vologda Oblast*, Russia was declared the home of the Russian Ded Moroz by Yury Luzhkov, then Mayor of Moscow. Between 2003 and 2010, the post office in Veliky Ustyug received approximately 2,000,000 letters from within Russia and from all over the world for Ded Moroz.

Remember back in March 2022 when we refused to send Patriots because it would require sending US troops to Ukraine in order to operate them? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/03/why-us-wont-give-patriot-interceptors-ukraine/363042/

We spent months dragging our feet until we finally changed our mind back in December and agreed to send the Patriots.

https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144662505/us-ukraine-patriot-missile-system

The only reason we agreed to send the Abrams tanks is because it was the only way Germany would agree to send the Leopards.

https://www.politico.eu/article/biden-abrams-tank-leopard-tank-ukraine-zelenskyy-war-russia-invasion-armour-military-aid/amp/

We spent a year refusing to send ATACMS because Sullivan thinks it would start WW3. His argument eventually got blown up by Storm Shadows.

https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/08/07/interview-why-wont-biden-hand-over-long-range-himars-atacms/

This is a real beauty from last summer:

""I have it on solid authority from a senior source within the U.S. national security establishment that President Biden was actually inclined to provide Ukraine with the desperately needed weapons, but was dissuaded from doing so by his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.""

https://archive.kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/fire-u-s-security-advisor-jake-sullivan.html

The numbers aren't there yet, but say it's 1-10 million tons of grain lost from the annual food supply.  A ton is roughly 3 million Calories.
