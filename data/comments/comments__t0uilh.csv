Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It’s a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

YOU DON’T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON’T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

We more or less know that Ukraine is using the fuck out of some Javelin launchers. I can't find the official line right now but wiki lists the Ukraine report as 30 tanks and ""<130 armored vehicles"" which sounded vaguely like what I recall. So let's say half of that to adjust for propaganda.

15 tanks \* 3 crew per tank is 45 on its own. ""Armored vehicles"" we can assume to be APCs. Checking the BPM-97 (kind of arbitrary since it was the first one I found that is currently in use) we see 2 crew and 8-12 passengers. So let's say 10. So 60\*10 gives us 600 on its own.

1) intensify attacks along the border, so troops leave Kyiv;
2) seize one of Kyiv’s airports, as sabotage groups disconnect the city from electricity and communications to cause panic;
3) organize arson and looting to create more panic;
4) launch a cyber attack on government websites;
5) induce more panic to create “uncontrolled columns of refugees’ from Kyiv to block highways and hinder movement of Ukrainian troops;
6) capture and hold government buildings.

Desired goal: Seize the leadership of the state (not specified who) and force them to sign a peace agreement on Russian terms, threatening large civilian deaths. 

Result – Ukraine can be divided into two parts, like East and West Germany.

>3) organize arson and looting to create more panic;

>4) launch a cyber attack on government websites;

>5) induce more panic to create “uncontrolled columns of refugees’ from Kyiv to block highways and hinder movement of Ukrainian troops;

>6) capture and hold government buildings.

Friendly reminder there is a ton of Russian intelligence/military in this thread trying to manipulate discourse and derail meaningful conversation about Russia’s hostile and illegitimate actions towards Ukraine. Russia’s social influence campaigns are often intended to demoralize westerners and create social division by propagating inaccurate, hateful messaging on social issues, and also by attempting to undermine public perception and support for alliances between western nations. Here we also see them making efforts to exaggerate Russian victories over Ukraine to demoralize and reduce support for Ukraine’s position. Don’t fall for it, it’s just part of their adversarial strategy and information warfare. Here are some great resources with documented evidence as proof:

Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister of the
Republic of India Narendra Modi.
February 24. 2022
21:20

> When discussing the situation around Ukraine, Vladimir Putin outlined the fundamental
assessments of Kiev's aggressive actions against the civilian population of Donbass, as well
as the many years of destructive policy aimed at breaking the Minsk agreements. In these
circumstances, and also in connection with the unacceptable for Russia military
development of the United States and its NATO allies on the territory of Ukraine, it was
decided to launch a special military operation.
> The Prime Minister of India thanked for the clarification and asked for assistance in ensuring
the security of Indian citizens currentlv in Ukraine. The President of Russia said that the
necessary instructions would be given. Some issues of bilateral cooperation were touched upon in the context of the Russian-Indian
summit held in December 2021 in New Delhi.
It was agreed on further contacts at various levels.

I also feared we'd see a heavier use of fires, including MLRS blanketing areas with cluster munitions. Compared to its intervention in Syria, the Russian military appears to be taking more efforts to avoid civilian casualties, which tells us something about its ultimate goals. Russia lacks stockpiles of PGMs though, and if they go into cities, civilian casualties will increase. Obviously, Russia hopes that Ukraine or Zelensky will surrender without employing maximum force. The question is what would Russia be willing to do if Ukrainians continue to resist and start an insurgency in cities? One of my big questions is to what extent the Ukrainian military dispersed before this invasion, which made them less vulnerable to MLRS fire. I don't know, but that may be part of the reason the Ukrainian military was able to avoid catastrophic losses on day. Interestingly, I haven't much evidence of Russian UAVs playing a key role either. It seems as though Russian forces are operating in a more restrained fashion than I expected. Maybe Putin underestimated Ukrainian resistance or is more concerned with Russian domestic opinion? The air assault operation also suggests that Russia thought it could possibly achieve a fait accompli without killing that many Ukrainian troops or civilians by making  a lighting push into Kyiv with light forces. It seems clear now that they'll have to use armor to get there. The goals of the operation and the invasion routes are all the ones we expected, but I'm a little surprised about the way the Russian military is executing the plan. This isn't Crimea in 2014. So Russia will likely need to use more force than it expected to achieve its goals. The Ukrainian military can not prevent the Russian military from pushing farther into Ukraine. The question is whether Russian troops will go into cities and how bad that could get. It appears Russian forces are trying to bypass some cities, but probably not Kyiv.

Is this the media's attempt at helping Ukraine, or is a county as little as Ukraine actually putting. Up the fight that it seems like they are from the internet? I'm curious

I hope it's true but it's very hard to believe.

It feels like a country will never be taken in a day and the fact that Ukraine was able to hold for a day really isn't that special. Am I crazy in thinking this? I saw posts saying taking a city like Kyiv on its own should take Russian two weeks minimum.

Judging from history that's the case, looking at Afghanistan and Vietnam and see what it actually takes to take a country is a lot.

I've had the same reaction since that first early bird woke up. I have never been to Ukraine, never even really knew much about it before all this, but now I've been watching this live stream of the central square in their capital city for over 24 hours off and on, and for several hours straight now while I work. Their Independence Square, no less.

I feel like I'm looking through bomb proof glass to see the last vestiges of peace there before saying goodbye. Watching the relatively normal activity of the day (everyone still following traffic signals!) fade into the fearsome darkness of night. Eerie, deserved calm punctuated by terrible explosions in the distance. Then the birds, and things are slowly waking up again. There's light in the sky. But I don't know how anything or anyone there slept. It's so surreal. 

(There's another explosion just now). 

And I feel infinitely terrible for the people under threat there, and I feel disgusting that I'm just sitting here watching it like it's a tv show, safe. The Internet is just 🤯. I'm a voyeur while they are in grave danger. Commenting on Reddit like it's some sort of _entertainment_.

Now I feel even more terrible for never seeing this before they went into crisis, not caring before. Unable to help now.

The lights just went out in Kyiv for the day and now I have to go to sleep. I don't know if I'll see this city this alive again when I wake up.

Other parts of the song go ""Show me a country where its population glorifies a tyrant"" (meaning Stalin). ""Where a victory over itself is celebrated by the people"". (meaning the Bolshevik revolution).

❗️Further, up to 10 thousand more paratroopers will arrive in the capital by Il-76 aircraft, along with light armored vehicles.

❗️One of the tasks is to seize Ukrainian power and, through blackmail, force them to sign agreements on Russia's terms.

❗️Even if the authorities have time to evacuate, one of the pro-Russian political puppets will head the government, arguing this with the flight of the previous leadership.

The bridge in Ivankiv was reported blown several hours ago to stop them but that didn't happen, they couldn't have put up a pontoon bridge this quickly. At the same time reports came of Russian armor in Dymer which is like 10km south of that bridge. Then news came out that the bridge south of Dymer in Demydiv was blown. Now it's report they are going west from Dymer to the Hostomel that was where the airprot that was attacked earlier yesterday. Now south of Hostomel is several bridges that they could cross.

Basically they're hoping to establish [this dashed red line border](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMTpM4VWQAQNbP-?format=jpg&name=4096x4096) so they can plug up the gaps between mountains.

With their recent subjugation of Belarus and Kazakhstan, they're down to 3 remaining gaps. By taking over Ukraine they'll be able to seal off the Bessarabian Gap and the Polish Gap, leaving only the Baltic Sea gap as their remaining weakness (which is why the Baltic countries are currently freaking out -- they know they're next, and could easily be cut off from the rest of Europe by a pincer move from Belarus and Kaliningrad).

That, plus the world is being split into a Russia, China & Friends coalition vs a US & Friends coalition, and the more resources they can control, the better (eg. together, Russia and Ukraine produce 1/4 of the world's wheat). It's an old-school mentality (literally, it's how Russian leaders have thought since at least Catherine the Great, if not earlier) but it's worked for Russian leaders thus far. Basically, they don't see a way to live on equal, friendly terms with the west, so they'd rather be feared and as powerful as possible. Does that explain it?

Edit: What the oligarchs want doesn't really matter because they don't have any guns & by this point they're tied to Putin no matter what. They could leave, but their resources in the west have been frozen and they'd lose access to everything they own in Russia, which would then be divided amongst the loyalists that stayed. Not to mention, they'll probably be splitting the spoils of Ukraine's various industries amongst themselves once a proper puppet government is established anyways (some will likely BECOME puppet governors themselves), so better to stick around and make the best of the current situation, no matter how it plays out.",1645765781.0,1645765170.0,t3_t0uilh,t1_hyc81py,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

'Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack,' a communiqué from the time read.

It also said Allies' response 'need not be restricted to the cyber domain.'

Warner also said Wednesday that a potential cyberattack may not even be an accident, suggesting Putin would launch one in response to Western sanctions.

'Putin's been pretty clear that one of the first tools he would use to bring economic harm to NATO and America is cyber,' the Democrat senator said. 'Play over that whole scenario, just at a larger level, and all the hypothetical conversations about what will constitute an act of war... suddenly get very real.'

I feel the fact Russia troops are 20 min away from Kyiv per se is bad. I also think Russia hasn’t really went too insanely aggressive yet with cruise missiles / rockets. I feel if they wanted, they could level Kyiv and other cities which would really crush Ukrainian morale (yes this would be very frowned upon and many civilians would die). 


I find the #s odd. So you are telling me Russia didn’t hit more people with those mlrs/ cruise missile attacks on day 1? I also find it worrisome that Ukraine lose the ability to compete in the air. Going to be tough to win if Russia has no air competition other than that coming from pads. 

It’s hard to tell what’s going on though honestly by media coverage. Idk how many Ukrainian soldiers there are and where they are. Russia- is attacking from so many sides so feel they have an edge. I’m kinda surprised more tanks haven’t been out of commission for Russia. I feel they should be pinging tanks with javelins but again I don’t know much about war / war strategy.

Think Russia will pay a very big price regardless. This looks like it will take a long time and isn’t fully supported by Russian citizens.",False,1645765644.0,t3_t0uilh,t1_hycb266,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Too many people watch movies and have this idea that they are going to be as capable as the Vietnamese or Middle East in guerilla warfare just because they have a rifle.

Not even a comparison. Russia is one of the top three militaries in the world that has been planning an invasion since at least 2013 isn't going to be defeated because a bunch of a civilians are walking around with assault rifles. 

Literally. They're handing them out at this point. And surprise, they are nowhere near a reversal victory for Ukraine.

The goal also isn't extermination (yet) but for Putin to de-stabalize the region and install a puppet government. It is certainly possible that an armed population may go underground and actively resist Putin for an Indefinite amount of time.

Personally I don't like sitting here watching Ukraine getting bombed and wish we could do more about it, but in our attempts to do the 'right thing', we're trying to avoid the worst case scenario of global nuclear war. However I feel this, as you point out, just allows Russia to domino effect the situation and puts them in a more advantageous position for the next offense which can just as easily spill into a nuclear conflict. 

So if we're headed that way (people will always argue against this), I'd sooner say knock the bully out before letting him to go to the gym and get stronger.

It really is a shit situation, and I'd sooner just live a quiet, boring, peaceful life. But there are crazy bad actors (re: Putin) in the world that have a stick up their ass about their misunderstandings of history and personal grievance/ego/legacy issues that ultimately stoke the flames of conflict, and humans have been warring with each other for as long as we have been around. It sucks, but sometimes that's the hard decision that is the reason why being a leader is so difficult - no one wants to make it and take the flak.

You see my state is gerrymandered to the point where the tiny fraction of folks who actually get out to vote in the Republican Primary have a disproportionate power of the state's politics. While the process unfolded from 2002 through the present, only now is the dead end presenting itself for the good ole GOP. Through said process of acute gerrymanders, they've effectively ceded the control of the electorate to the weird guys at the knife and gun show (a local weaponry exposition for our European friends), that no one really wants to talk to.

As a consequence, traditional establishment republicans are always vulnerable to a challenge from the right.  And this is what has driven Abbott to go anti-lgtbq.  There is nothing excusable about this, mind you. 

This is simply the political reality on the ground, for those that are curious.  It the political situation were vice versa, it would be as if the democrats had gerrymandered all the districts so that the Warhammer 50K crowd was the backbone of the party, and had elected Bernie Sanders as their Emperor For Eternity (hyperbole of course, and not to cast the WH50K crowd as a political monolith). 

All to say, is that the policies espoused by Abbot are the politics of Abbot trying to survive a primary with 2 challengers running from the right.  And it damn sure aint the opinion of everybody in the state. Nor mine.

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Ukrainians surprised us all with their resiliency... at least from the American perspective. Us Americans are still feeling the defeat of Afghanistan, so a lot of us are kinda demoralized looking into this.

In just 24 hours, Russia launched a ton of missiles and commenced a series of air-raids and naval assaults on Ukraine, as well as advancing with heavy armor and paratroopers.

The paratroopers were defeated, many airplanes were shot down, helicopters blown up, and many tanks are smoldering piles of trash now.

That's not slow-playing. If anything, Russia overplayed and over-committed in the 1st day while Ukrainians kicked their fucking ass. We're entering day 2, but this time knowing that Russia is probably feeling frustrated and may cause more atrocities to get what they want.

If Russia's key trade partner like Germany cuts off all trade, thats an actual response as China just cant replace all the trade volume Germany contributes to Russian economy.

Taiwan is close enough to mainland China that they can directly attack major Chinese cities. 

Russian soldiers can walk to Ukraine if need be. Chinese soldiers cannot swim to Taiwan. And any build up force large enough to take Taiwan would take months or years and be incredibly obvious to everyone. 

Basically, Taiwan is way more fortified, and attacking a fortified island with a large enough force to invade is a bit of a nightmare. And unlike Ukraine, Taiwan can retaliate and really hurt China.
