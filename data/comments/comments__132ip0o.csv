Mariupol.

Almost half a million people once lived there. And now there are almost no intact houses left. The 🇷🇺 terrorist state did everything to kill this city. Over 90% of Mariupol is destroyed.

Day 428-430 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 3 days were mostly quiet here in the city, there were no missiles fired in our direction, but a new comparatively “big” missile strike did sadly happen. Although it can hardly be called big when they only fired around 23-25 missiles, which is almost nothing when compared to the strikes where they were using 60-100 missiles.

Those fucking bastards still continue to specifically target civilians. They hit residential buildings in multiple regions and they did it at night too, which is the time when they would inflict the greatest number of casualties because most people would be asleep in their homes. The situation in Uman is just horrific, they killed 23 people, including 6 children, and for fucking what? What the fuck did that achieve?

They also killed a child and her mother in Dnipro where they targeted a private house. And then their MOD goes and fucking posts “Right on target” after killing 7 children in 1 missile strike. I don’t even know what to say, they are just barbaric monsters. Today their news channels also stole the video of that woman from Uman that survived their missile strike to say that “Ukrainians are bombing Donetsk”. Every time you think that Russians can’t go any lower, somehow, they always manage to reach a new low.",False,1682806302.0,t3_132ip0o,t3_132ip0o,,0,142,0,142,0,0,

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHLrH9Q\_E4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHLrH9Q_E4)

The algorithm saw fit to recommend me this channel and now I'm recommending it to you all. Every few days, the host (Jonathan Fink) speaks with a guest in a podcast-style hour-long interview. This one is especially interesting; it was hard to select just a few quotes so I selected a whole bunch of 'em:

>\[3:50\] Why exactly does Russia think that it is both *entitled* to do this and has a *duty* to do this? In fact, it is operating in an entirely different environment, mentally, from what we take for granted as normal and natural in the West. It is simply because Russia hasn't gone through the kind of national or societal transformations that other countries have. If you think of Russia's behavior at the moment \[...\] it's perfectly normal if you go back several centuries. In a way, the Russian threat is not just external to Europe but also it's external to the time we're in.  
>  
>\[6:15\] The whole issue of trying to ascribe Russian behaviors to some kind of theory of international relations is pretty damaging to understanding what it is that Russia thinks about the world and how it might react to the world around it.  
>  
>\[8:00\] One of the things that we've benefitted from greatly during this most recent crisis is President Putin and those around him have been entirely more honest about what it is that they want from the world and how they want to go about getting it. That has, for example, completely torpedoed all of the arguments that we heard over decades that Russia is just responding to NATO enlarging and NATO accepting membership applications from those countries that wanted protection from Russia. That pretense has been completely discarded by Russia.  
>  
>\[11:23\] The countries that think they are protected by distance from the Russian threat count the cost without understanding the risk of not investing those costs. The countries that would prefer Ukraine to sign a ceasefire agreement as rapidly as possible without realizing -- or possibly realizing but not caring -- \[...\] that that just rewards Russia for armed aggression, and confirms to Moscow that that is the best way to get what it wants.  
>  
>\[12:42\] I think people fail to understand how the imperial process works and has worked since Muscovy really came to the fore several hundred years ago: once it conquers a territory and it's able to subjugate that population then it will use that population to attack the next chunk of land. So by rewarding it Donbass, what you get is the weaponization of that population. As we've seen, forcing them into the meat grinder to fight essentially against their fellow Ukrainians. \[...\] Some will go willingly because of this brainwashing process.  
>  
>\[14:42\] Too many people got used to the idea of the Russia as they saw it during the 1990s and early 2000s. Weak, incapable, but also friendly towards the West and interested in International Relations. \[...\] That was the temporary interruption to the normal state of affairs, and now Russia is moving back towards its historical comfort zone: repression at home, and hostility abroad.  
>  
>\[18:47\] You have people leaving Russia in two waves primarily: first of all after Feb 2022 the people who did recognize what Russia had become and wanted nothing to do with it. \[...\] And then in Sep 2022 you had people who were ambivalent about the war -- possibly even in favor of it -- but didn't want to be involved with it personally. \[...\] It is a great deal more complex than assuming that because someone is outside Russia, they will not be still mentally within Russia. \[...\] What it also means is that those that are left behind, within Russia itself, on average are likely to be even more supportive of this war of colonial reconquest.  
>  
>\[23:17\] \[Author Jade McGlynn\] looks at the pattern of support, why they came about, why it is that Russians exist in this alternative reality with tragic consequences. Having been so isolated from real information about the outside world that at the beginning of the invasion, when Ukrainians called their friends an family members in Russia to explain what is happening... they're not believed, because it cannot possibly be that they are being bombed by Russians.  
>  
>\[28:40\] Russia's campaign for global influence over the last few years has been most successful where there has been a vacuum to move into. It can be a vacuum of Western interest, a vacuum of engagement by the former colonial powers, a vacuum of rule of law -- if you look at the patterns of Russian engagement in sub-Saharan Africa, they are most successful where there are fewest remaining safeguards against corruption and subversion of government. By contrast, where rule of law remains relatively strong, Russia doesn't make inroads. The consistent pattern is this: lack of resistance invites Russian intervention.  
>  
>\[31:49\] The general tone of Western diplomacy is completely unsuited to dealing with Russia. \[...\] Every country around Europe has its own particular problem in dealing with Moscow, and they are self-inflicted problems. \[...\] That's France under Macron with his messianic vision for striking out on his own to make France relevant. It's Germany under Scholtz with his absolute reluctance to actually do anything. It's the UK under a succession of prime ministers who did not want to look at the problem of Russian influence here because it would be deeply inconvenient for their party funding.  
>  
>\[33:29\] In the latter stages, when it was becoming completely clear that Putin was going to launch the invasion, these leaders, these senior figures, these diplomats, these espionage chiefs, were going to Moscow armed with that knowledge, confronting Russia saying we know that you are going to invade... but then not promising any consequences. Russia heard the same old words they'd heard so many times before and knew from past experience that this was something they needn't take seriously.  
>  
>\[37:40\] The experience of the 1990s has been twisted around 180 degrees so that rather than the West helping Russia -- which it did, pouring in billions of financial aid, delivering food when Russia was incapable of feeding its own population, trying to draw Russia into the international community \[...\] giving Russia the seat at the U.N. Security Council that it was entirely unentitled to, with devastating consequences now -- all of these are now being presented as ways in which the West ""humiliated"" Russia.  
>  
>\[47:38\] The approved history is very different from what actually happened, because Russia has returned to and reinforced all of the Soviet myths about the Second World War according to which it started in 1941 with an unprovoked assault by Nazi Germany and Russia was doing absolutely nothing before then... but also Russia's behavior during and after the war has been twisted beyond all recognition: the idea that this was a crusade of liberation of Eastern Europe as opposed to Russia following through on its plan of taking control of Eastern Europe in competition with Nazi Germany instead of in collaboration with it. The way in which the war started is elided from Russian history and it is a criminal offense to refer to it; you can get prosecuted for pointing out the real events of 1939-1940.  
>  
>\[52:28\] These ideas of starting a new relationship are based on the mental image of Germany or Japan after the Second World War without going through that vital stage of a decades-long process of uprooting the constitution, the education system, changing social attitudes and so on. Whatever happens in Russia has to happen organically, which means it is going to take vastly longer... but the key ingredient is going to be defeat in Ukraine, because without a setback to Russian imperial aims that is sufficiently resounding \[...\] there will not be that initial seed that might initially lead to change. And therefore we are going to be facing the same Russia problem into the foreseeable future. That is the reason why so many of these calls for a negotiated settlement -- for freezing the conflict instead of resolving it -- are unfortunately fraught with disaster.  
>  
>\[54:54\] My fear is that the opportunity to deal that defeat to Russia may have been missed through Western countries subscribing to this idea that you cannot defeat Russia because it's too dangerous. On the other hand, Ukraine will continue to be the frontline, will continue to be the defenders of Europe -- but potentially not the only one. If Russia finds that there is a softer target elsewhere along its Western periphery, it will go for that softer target as it always has done.",False,1682778523.0,t3_132ip0o,t3_132ip0o,,0,80,0,80,0,0,

Two days ago, included in the ‘SVO’ news, was the coverage of a young man from Rostov, sentenced for 4 years, for wanting/planning to go fight on the side of Ukraine. 

In part:

> Preparing for the crime, he monitored the information reports of the combat areas on the border territory of Ukraine, developed a walking route for crossing the state border, bypassing the established checkpoints.

> Also, to confirm his readiness for service, he was going to set fire to the military registration and enlistment office in one of the cities of the central part of Russia, and then send a video report to representatives of the legion.

The sentiment for that was mixed—some thought he was a traitor, some thought he likely had UA family—the bulk wrote that this was a Sovietesque persecution—because it was a “thought crime.”  That there was no *corpus delecti*, that he was only in the mental preparations stage had not actually *done* anything.  No “action in furtherance of a crime.”  He was literally just thinking about all this.  The Russians commenting overwhelming saw the prosecution of this worrisome, because no one wants to live in an NK world of there being “thought police.”

____

Yesterday, included in the “Special Military Operation” news was Putin’s decree regarding deportation.  The way Russian news covered it was to say that those who have not accepted Russian citizenship, will first of all be categorized as foreigners under Russian law.  Then, if they do one of several crimes (disrupt public order, including “participating in an unsanctioned assembly, rally, demonstration, procession or picketing,” support extremism or terrorism, etc.) will be handled as when *foreigners* commit *this subcategory of crimes* [ie, not arrested, rather immediately expelled as a *persona non grata*]. “If such a decision is made, the person is obliged to leave Russia within three calendar days from the date of notification. The document states that those who do not fulfill this obligation are subject to deportation.”

In the comment section, the Russian readers were not having this.

First, some thought that they “should be” held to the same repercussions that any Russian is—prison.

Others thought, well regardless if “should be” given prison, that this was lies and definitely won’t be deported and instead will be arrested and imprisoned bc the regime is just that dishonest and repressive.  

But the overwhelming majority didn’t have a comment on prison versus deportation, but rather, made sarcastic or cynical comments about annexing land under pretense of saving citizens only to expel those citizens. 

Here are *a few* of those comments:


_____

> We continue to save territories from their inhabitants?

_____

> That’s perfectly fine! For example, some old man from a neighboring apartment comes to me and says, ‘from now on, you and I will live *together* in your apartment; and there’s are a couple of people with me who’ll be here, too.  But if you don't like it, then get out of *your apartment*!!!’

> > you mean, “our apartment.”

> > > no it’s, “my apartment.”


____

> interesting... so, would Putin have had the courage to poke his nose into Ukraine, if Ukraine had time to enter NATO?

_____


> So .... a man lived for himself, by himself, lived in his own place...and then it became the territory of another state and he was deported ....hmmm

____

> but I have a question! here we believe that all sorts of banned Western liberal funds are trying to ruin our state, but really, think about it, if you look at what our leader did contributing to the collapse of the country's economy over the last 20 years, and the loss of respect towards our state on the world stage—then our leader did more than all these funds and other liberal journalists and Westerners! really he managed to undermine it all

____

> For some reason, all this news is not at all like what you expect!  Hmm...What kind of “Kiev in three days” is this?  if only some region was liberated or a large city was occupied - the second year of the Special Operation is underway, but we can only boast of Mariupol🤷‍♀️

In my humble opinion it has a few effects and they are all negative for Russia itself. 
1, hardens the resolve of the Ukrainian population and soldiers.
2, missiles are ""wasted"" because they could help them in the destruction of Ukrainian military assets. 
3, I'm not sure but those missiles must be expensive and limited in supply.
4, the international community and population becomes more willing to supply weapons for the defence of Ukrainian. (Dead children is not a good image) and I hope even alot of Russians must not like seeing dead children... 

So what is the gain in doing it?

Edit: if I may recap the answers (and thank you everyone!) 

1, They need to show something to the higher ups, even if it's a useless lie.  
2, they have stupid assumptions about what it might achieve in the Ukrainian population. 
3, they simply have little capacity to hit something relevant.

""I appeal to Shoigu with a request to immediately issue ammunition.

The leader of the mercenaries said that ""ammunition is no longer left for weeks, but for days."" ""If the shortage does not stop, part of the units we will be forced to withdraw from this territory, and then everything else will collapse,"" Prigozhin said.

But there is other news, and surprisingly, it has included news that is somewhat unflattering to Russia, though the details are always very slim.

[part one] 

For example, local press covered that Xi and Zelensky spoke, and that Zelensky told Xi that there’s an easy peace plan and that’s for Russia to leave and the 1991 borders be adhered to. 

**Today, local Russian press had 2 major bits—and they were printed together as** ***News of the Day***—**and taken together—will absolutely cause trepidation amongst the Russians.**

**First, it covered the major fire in Crimea**—and despite the Russians saying how air defense works, there was many daunting, frightening pictures/gifs/videos of the absolutely massive damage.  Which made the Russian assurances appear preposterous. And would undoubtedly cause nervous feelings, even far away from the action. 

**Second: Coupled with such imagery, was information about Ukraine’s upcoming counteroffensive, including many quotes from Zelensky himself**.  So after the scary photos, the Russian press basically published Zelensky saying “we’re coming for Crimea.” [Edit: they quote from an interview Zelensky gave *a different news agency.*]

Here’s what was written in one newspaper from a midsized city wrote:

> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the Ukrainian military is planning a counteroffensive. In an interview with *Yle*, he said that Ukraine ""will be able to repel Russian forces, as well as return the Crimean peninsula under control.""

> Zelensky noted that the success of Ukraine largely depends on the supply of weapons by the West.

> “We want to save as many lives as possible, so the number of weapons matters,” the Ukrainian president said. “It is cheaper for other countries to support Ukraine now than to increase the risks of a Third World War.”

> Zelensky did not name the timing of the counteroffensive. According to *Yle*, this will happen in late spring or early summer.

> The founder of Wagner PMC, Yevgeny Prigozhin, suggested that the Ukrainian counteroffensive would be carried out before May 15. He expressed this opinion in a video interview with journalist Semyon Pegov.",1682796940.0,1682793917.0,t3_132ip0o,t3_132ip0o,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Either smoke and mirrors as is many things, or against all odds we’ll start seeing Wagner retreat if Prigozhin was actually 100% serious.

From my totally armchair expert position, it seems to me Prigozhin only cares about money and power and has little to no care about Russian MoD or anything going on inside there.

When the mission changed, his superiors said he became erratic, hostile, and was obsessed with writing up new plans which were not in alignment with the reformed mission.  The Pentagon decided to remove him from the field, as determining it was the field which had impacted him.  

He was appointed to the prestigious position of the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, under Obama.  He did not excel there, and is said to ... not spiral, exactly...  He had questionable judgement, and was officially removed for “insubordination,” and retired. Top officials found him to make questionable decisions, and then, be less than candid about them afterwards.  

In his retirement, he was taking paid speaking positions as many generals do, as well as have a private cyber security firm, also common.  One or more of the speaking jobs was involved with Russians—which again, raised eyebrows.  When questioned, he either feigned ignorance, or blamed The Speakers Bureau (I think that’s the name, the booking agency that these high profile DC folks get to give them gigs). Trump started campaigning and he immediately jumped on the trump train, as a military advisor. 

In preparation to hand over the presidency, Obama met with Trump one afternoon.  It was disclosed that Obama only gave a handful of warnings, one was to not hire Flynn as National Security Advisor—he could not be trusted [yet not enough evidence that actually doing crimes].  

Trump ignored the advice.  Hired him, he lasted a month or so.

Basically, all this Russia stuff was swirling around, the FBI investigates, finds things untoward yet not illegal, questions him, he denies and also denies in convo w Pence.  FBI discloses they have evidence that lied, Trump fires, he’s later charged with lying to FBI, Trump pardons.  The thing he lied about was not even a crime—it was whether Russians had approached during campaign, and what was said if so; and did he & Kushner approach the Russian embassy, did they try to get a line to the Kremlin that way, what was that all about.

He was never charged with treason.  I’m sure that if there’s evidence of it, he’ll be charged.  No one likes him or trusts him.  But there’s never been proof that actually did any crimes.

We just need to remember that the full-fledged railway line through the Kerch Bridge crossing is not yet operational... And not only fuel and lubricants are being transported through it, but also a lot of other things - from the zinc crates, to food and ammunition.


We can also inquire, for a complete picture, what is the full refueling of a modern frigate, or how much aviation kerosene a Su-35SM burns during one flight, and so on.

You have to understand strategic importance of the Kerch Bridge crossing and the current inefficiencies in its operation. With the railway line not yet fully operational, the transportation of essential supplies, such as fuel, food, and ammunition, is limited. This situation presents a vulnerability that the Ukrainian command is well aware of, as they can track any tanker ship attempting to transport goods.

That's what happens when you stop an active fighting force from recruiting. Taking that into consideration anything that Prigozhin says about Wagner treatment publicly is meant for Wagnerites. He's towing the line for the Kremlin by playing the man in their corner, the man who has their back. he's the steward of Wagner and he's known for months they're being downsized. Wagner and the mod were in direct competition for manpower and ammo. there was no other outcome than that Wagner would become a spent force. 

So when you hear Prigozhin speak about Wagner what you're hearing is a man who has to help these dudes die, literally. He can't reinforce them. He can't gain favor for them in Moscow while their number and combat strength ever weakens. 

basically his public statements are all theater meant to make wagnerites think he's got their back, to motivate, to help recruit elsewhere where they actually can, like Africa etc. his threats to the mod are idle. he's performing a job as the public face of this diminishing force to keep them doing their jobs. 

it may also be true that he's mad about how things are going down, but that's neither here nor there. the public comments are a ruse.

as far as a discussed withdrawal it's either more empty bluster or he's setting the table for when whatever he expects to happen becomes obvious to the rest of us.  if Wagner were to actually withdraw it would be at the direction of the mod I promise you.

USA doing everything to convince the public and allies that Russia would invade, calling out specific dates and forcing Russia to restrain. Forte up over Ukraine scanning the whole frontline up until the very least minute. I've followed this war obsessively since before it started. I've read probably 80% of all comments in all these live threads since.

If you want to know, Reddit says I've spent several hours per day in these threads. That was in my yearly recap. I'm going to be here until the end. I'll always support Ukraine. And once this is over, I'll go over there and visit, maybe volunteer to help rebuild.

Troops who'd be rotated into their positions ""temporarily"" though, different story. They'd scramble for their protective gear, run for cover, etc. That's protocol, but doesn't make the contrast any less. Mortar fire scares you until you get used to it.

The phrase ""life goes on"", some grim jokes, mixed with some fatalism and the belief (or hope) that you'll not be one of the unlucky ones, or maybe that fatalism leads some people to think death would be an improvement on their situation.  

On the one hand, it allows people to function in those extreme circumstances, but on the other hand, it can lead to carelessness and recklessness.  

It reminds me of something an old guy once said. Once he was a courier who had to deliver messages, etc. even if it meant taking shortcuts across no man's land or near enemy lines. His only mission was to get the message through. That meant not risking himself by engaging needlessly with enemy troops for that may mean the message being captured.

The primary thing which the nuclear bomb did though was change the strategic calculus for the Japanese: they were under the belief that they would be able to engage American bombers when they attempted their invasion, which in turn would prevent them from being able to destroy their fortifications , factories etc.

The nuclear bomb changed all that - it was dropped from high altitude, where Japanese air defense couldn't touch the bomber (this was the original intent of the bombers in use, but high altitude bombing was inaccurate so it wasn't done).

The Japanese had no counter-measure - they couldn't reliably engage high altitude bombers, but high altitude bombers now didn't need to be accurate because 1 nuclear bomb would take out every target you needed to hit and blow giant holes in fortification lines.

At the time, the US doctrine was very much thinking that burning the cities would end the war but it wasn't really what happened - because they'd been doing that under LeMay and it hadn't achieved much of anything.
