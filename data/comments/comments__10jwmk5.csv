SiK wants to facilitate the resale of Swiss war material

According to the Security Policy Commission of the National Council, the re-export of Swiss war material should be possible in certain cases.  (archive image)
According to the Security Policy Commission of the National Council, the re-export of Swiss war material should be possible in certain cases.

U-turn in arms exports: The Security Policy Commission of the National Council wants to pass on Swiss arms under certain circumstances — including to warring states.

Under certain circumstances, Swiss weapons should also be allowed to be passed on to warring states. The Security Policy Commission of the National Council (SiK-N) demands this, especially with a view to the war in Ukraine .


The Commission has passed a corresponding motion and a parliamentary initiative, as the parliamentary services announced on Tuesday. The parliamentary initiative stipulates that the non-re-export declaration will no longer apply if war material is re-exported to Ukraine in connection with the Russian-Ukrainian war.


The motion has the same goal, but is formulated more openly. According to this, the declaration of non-re-export can be canceled if the re-export relates to a situation in which the UN Security Council or the UN General Assembly has determined a contradiction to the international prohibition of the use of force with a two-thirds majority.

Neutral or not?
According to the announcement, the decision to relax the War Material Act was made by the commission by 14 to 11 votes. The majority therefore argued that Switzerland must make its contribution to European security and accordingly support Ukraine more.

In her opinion, the requested changes are in line with the law of neutrality, since they do not allow the direct export of war material to conflict zones, but only affect the non-re-export declarations of the countries that buy Swiss war material.

The minority of the commission - including representatives of the SVP and the Greens - considers the re-export of Swiss war material to Ukraine to be problematic with regard to neutrality, specifically with regard to the principle of equal treatment provided for by neutrality law.

The sister commission of the Council of States will deal with the parliamentary initiative next. The motion goes to the Federal Council for an answer and then to the grand chamber. If the Federal Council rejects an amendment to the War Material Act, it would be conceivable for the SIK-N majority for the government to propose a parliamentary ordinance to the Federal Assembly to clarify the situation in the event of Ukraine's self-defence.

Several requests rejected
In the past few weeks and months, numerous countries have asked the Federal Council to hand over Swiss weapons to Ukraine. Up to now, the Federal Council has always rejected these requests. He referred to the recently passed tightening of the federal law on war material and to aspects of neutrality law.

This negative attitude drew a lot of international criticism for Switzerland. According to the SIK-N, there is sometimes the problem that Switzerland is no longer perceived as a reliable partner in a Western alliance of values. Ukraine was attacked by Russia in violation of international law and is now defending values ​​that are also lived by Switzerland and are always demanded in the international context.

The Commission is concerned with ""making a temporary and clearly limited adjustment to the re-export regulations in order to assist Ukraine in the war against Russia,"" it said. With the new rules, Switzerland would continue to refrain from supplying any weapons directly to Ukraine and would thus not violate the law of neutrality.

Gsoa criticizes SP
While the SP has changed its stance on the subject and is now speaking of a ""pragmatic compromise proposal"", the group fears a ""undermining of the War Material Act"" for a Switzerland without an army (Gsoa). From their point of view, the law of neutrality does not allow the cancellation of the non-re-export declaration for individual countries.

If Switzerland were to allow Germany to supply arms to Ukraine, it would have to do the same if Iran made a request to pass on Rheinmetall cannons to Russia, Gsoa argued. In this case, the Federal Council would be faced with a dilemma.

Deputy Prosecutor General Oleskiy Symonenko went on a 10-day European vacation for New Years, driven in a G-class owned by a rich guy from Lviv.

Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories Ivan Lukerya and Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories Vyacheslav Negoda both went down for their connection to Deputy Infrastructure Minister Vasyl Lozinskyi, who was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of accepting a bribe worth over $350,000 (£285,000) over the supply of electricity generators. 

Kyrylo Tymoshenko, Zelensky's deputy head of office, drove around in a Chevy Tahoe that had been donated for humanitarian purposes, and took excessive trips for photoops while overseeing the restoration of destroyed housing and infrastructure. Note that he switched to the Tahoe after earlier in 2022 he was accused of driving around in a Porsche Taycan given to him by some other rich businessman. 

Four out of five regional heads, Valentyn Reznichenko from Dnipro, Oleksandr Starukh from Zaporizhzhia, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi from Sumy, and Yaroslav Yanushevych from Kherson all went down for their ties to Kyrylo Tymoshenko and his photoops.

Some context:

\- ""There was a consensus on NATO membership from all 30 members"" - EU & NATO integration head of Ukraine after NATO Ministerial meeting at Bucharest

\- Turkey is a strategic partner of Ukraine (Navy ship manufacturer, Baykar is building a drone factory in Ukraine and using Ukr-produced engines for it's brand new Kizilema drone)

This is just a rehash of the same lazy positioning — not really losing to loser Ukraine, but rather being in a war with the best NATO has to offer, with a small added twist of specifying some countries as running the show. This opens up the possibility of driving a wedge into the coalition and splintering off the ones who don't fit the epithet. Say... Turkie, or... Finland? Or Morocco? How's that suppose to work?

> Ukrainian military intelligence document obtained by CNN sets out how effective [Wagner has] been around the city of Bakhmut – and how difficult they are to fight against

> The Ukrainian report – dated December 2022 – concludes that Wagner represents a unique threat at close quarters, even while suffering extraordinary casualties. “The deaths of thousands of Wagner soldiers do not matter to Russian society,” the report asserts.

> “Assault groups do not withdraw without a command… Unauthorized withdrawal of a team or without being wounded is punishable by execution on the spot.” 

> “Assault infantry is not allowed to carry the wounded off the battlefield on their own, as their main task is to continue the assault until the goal is achieved. If the assault fails, retreat is also allowed only at night.” 

> the Ukrainian analysis says that Wagner’s tactics “are the only ones that are effective for the poorly trained mobilized troops that make up the majority of Russian ground forces.”

> It suggests the Russian army may even be adapting its tactics to become more like Wagner, saying: “Instead of the classic battalion tactical groups of the Russian Armed Forces, assault units are proposed.” 

While seemingly rehashing most of what we already know, new bits of info is that they're literally ordered not to help the wounded; and they're only allowed to retreat at night. Definitely explains the casualty rate as well as their meager gains. 

Another bit of new info is that Russian army might be switching over to Wagner tactics. That might already be reflected in the videos we're seeing from the battlefield. The Zaporizhzhia offensive that tried to use whole BTGs failed utterly and immediately, so perhaps we'll see an even more rapid shift.

> 2. It's isn't ""learning the tank"" I'm concerned about:
> --can they quickly learn the capability of the Abrams (& Leopard II) the way it is designed to operate.  That's training w/ other tanks, infantry, scouts, drones,artillery, engineers, intel...all more than crew training. 2/

> --when the tank - or small critical parts in the tank - break (which they do), & when those small & large  replacement parts need replacing, & when it requires daily/weekly/monthly echelon maintenance, will Ukraine have also trained those who do these things. 3/

> -- after the tank crews, sections, companies, battalions master the gunnery skills, the maneuver, and the maintenance, will there also be echelons of support that will flow the needed parts, FUPPs, ammo, fuel, roadwheels, torsion bars, etc, etc, to the front lines? 4/

> The reason I ask these things is because I've seen how real armored operations work, and I know how American soldiers & units train continuously to get all these things synchronized.

> And it requires teamwork OUTSIDE THE TANK UNITS, TOO!  5/

> Those saying ""just give them the damned tanks!"" have likely never seen the choreography to making this work on the battlefield.  

> And those saying ""Ukraine has already incorporated other things, they can do this too!"" I'd only say I've seen US units- at our training centers...6/

> ...and in combat get just a few things wrong and it causes disaster and failure. Lethal tanks turn into pillboxes that don't move or shoot.

> To make all this work, it takes training, maintenance, supply & a team - beyond just the tankers - to get this right on the battlefield.7/

> I'm ecstatic Germany seems to have made a decision to provide Leos & it appears the US may provide some Abrams for the long term.

> But like I said it would take months to get Patriots to the battlefield (it looks like 3 months), getting these transfers will take time & effort. 8/

> I'll guess Leos will be ready for the fight by (maybe) March.  Abrams, likely, are a followon (I'll be listening to the POTUS speech tomorrow, but I suspect they are 8+ months out).

> But that's lightening speed to deliver & prepare a force not trained on these vehicles.9/

> All of this is VERY different from delivering and training individual soldiers on Javelin & Stingers, and crews on MRAPS, HMMWVS, HIMARS & Bradleys.

> Tanks, like aircraft, are a whole different ball game. 10/

> Combined arms conventional operations with lethal heavy armor isn't a video game.

> You can't drop technologically advanced equipment onto the battlefield expecting soldiers who do not know it will be able to use it, maintain it, or integrate it into a combined arms team. 11/

> And for everyone also saying ""the west should have given all this to them months ago,"" I'd say ""maybe, but an army and country fighting for it's life had a few other things on their mind, and we hadn't reached this part of the fight just yet."" 

> In war, it's hard to predict. 12/

This guy  now published a text, where he fully supports the war, as well as accuses West of ""anti -Russian provocations"".

> Increased activity in the Vuhledar direction. Our troops are under strict orders: go west young man! The orders are being followed. In a number of sectors we have pushed through the enemy defenses, and are working to encircle Vuhledar. Past experience suggested that attacking the town head-on will not work so our top brass is trying an encirclement. The day before the enemy increased reconnaissance, trying to get a complete picture of our preparations. Our air defenses worked effectively and shot down drones. This is not to say that they did not expect our offensive, but comms intercepts still showed significant confusion and disorganization in the ranks of the enemy. Although as we advanced their resistance became more organized. 

> The most difficult part is still casevac. People carrying the wounded out of the affected area present a large non-maneuverable target that the enemy can easily detects and engage.

Optics is a pragmatic and little discussed part of the deployment of NATO weapons in Ukraine. Everyone can agree it has been a total embarrassment for Russia to see it's finest armour decimated on the battlefield, particularly by cheap drones and cheap shoulder fired systems. Combat doctrine, everywhere, is changing as militaries watch it unfold. I think everyone was a little surprised to see how effective these were from the opening days - and I think nobody wants to see similar vulnerabilities exposed in NATO equipment. Indeed, all of the major contributions are low risk in this regard - advanced artillery, now anti-air etc. With tanks, F16s etc., I don't think the trepidation is so much about Putin's red lines, as the message if these are also easily countered with cheap systems. 

It is looking more like we will see both Leopard 2s and Abrams on the front lines in Ukraine by spring, which will be an interesting moment. I assume they will vastly outperform Russian armour, a glimpse into what an actual conflict between NATO and Russia might look like on the ground.

This possibly could have been some 4D Scholz chess.  These tanks proooobably were not going to be heavily used until Ukraine is ready to go on an offensive operation in the spring.  Western tanks are heavy and might struggle somewhat in the mud.  Meanwhile Russia has been weakening its own forces by tossing them at Ukrainian defense lines in situations where tanks might not be best utilized (slow defensive trench warfare involving mostly artillery and infantry).  

It may have always been that the West had some time to coordinate on tanks because they didn't want to see them in use until it was time to go back on the offensive.  Better to have a critical mass of them too rather than just 1-2 dozen.  100 or so Western tanks with good AA and artillery support AND well trained infantry with Western IFVs would make a hell of a spearhead to drive south to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Crimea.

I read a book on the Yom Kippur war a few years ago.  The author had notes from the Israeli leadership. They panicked because the ammunition storehouses did not have the inventory that was supposed to be there.  We can also confirm based on frantic calls to USA for urgent support.  The Nixon administration was eventually persuaded that the situation was desperate and ordered an airlift of munitions.  

Meanwhile there was no shortage of ammunition in Israel.  The Israelis had pillaged the armory while on the way to the front.  They were in a rush so soldiers did not fill out the paperwork.  The quartermaster were freaked out for no reason.  Orders from Tell Aviv said to conserve ammunition.  The army had full stocks and were also holding back.  

If the author is correct no ammunition carried by a US airplane ever made it to Sinai where it could be fired.  No M16 and no shell before the war ended.  However, within minutes of the first US transport touching down at Tell Aviv the order was sent by radio.  Let it rip.  The whole Israeli army in Egypt and Golan Heights fired every platform they had.

What is certain, is that it is not nice being an infantryman in this war ... if it ever has been. It is a mortar/arty/drone fest out there.


The new mobilised russians may go out the first time, but perhaps the second time they already know better. Earlier, attacking out from Izium, we read stories of Russian commanders saying ""We are ordered to attack, some must go, you can decide if you want to go or not"", and end result being small patrol skirmishes - so fighting morale at that point was not very good on the Russian side. Now it might be a little better, because the mobilised have false images of what they might be able to accomplish.

>The decision has been made: Germany will deliver Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine. According to SPIEGEL information, at least one Leopard 2A6 company is involved.
>
>Other allies, including from Scandinavia, also want to deliver Leopard 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine. The federal government wants to grant permission to export such tanks that are owned by other states such as Poland.
>
>The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday afternoon that the United States was considering supplying a not inconsiderable number of Abrams main battle tanks. France is also considering supplying battle tanks to Ukraine.
>
>The German decision was apparently preceded by intensive consultations over several days with the allies, especially in Washington. Scholz had always emphasized that he only wanted to supply battle tanks in conjunction with other nations such as the USA.
>
>Most recently, there had been reports of disagreements between Germany and the US administration, which Scholz was angry about internally.
>
>According to SPIEGEL information, the German Leopard tanks are said to come from Bundeswehr stocks. In the medium to long term, other battle tanks from industry stocks could be prepared for use.
>
>Most recently, the government partners Greens and FDP increased the pressure on Scholz to supply battle tanks to Ukraine. Only recently did the chancellor decide to make Marder infantry fighting vehicles available to Ukraine.

Ex: Russia may have 50 trained soldiers, equipped with Tank, Artillery, and IFV support. Having them charge by themselves is suicide (and trained soldiers are expensive: Russia likely cannot afford losses of well trained soldiers).

Instead of charging alone, those 50 guys will charge with 500 untrained soldiers. Even if the 500 guys don't know how to shoot, they'll provide cover. The Ukrainians will need to spend artillery support / mortar support on conscripts, not knowing ""which squad is the elite squad"". So the elite-squad has a better chance of surviving, and completing their mission.

Whether or not the 500 untrained soldiers die is not Russia's concern.

It has to do with Western vs Soviet doctrine. The Soviets emphasized numerical superiority to overcome NATO troops and force a breakthrough which would then then be exploited by massive quantities of personnel and equipment. Their tanks were designed around this concept and heavily influenced by their experience in WWII. Western tanks were designed solely to kill Soviet tanks. As a result, Western tanks have a marked qualitative edge. They are larger, heavier (better armor), more comfortable for the crew, have multiple enhancements for crew survivability, and their fire control and optics are vastly superior. First shot usually wins so Western tanks can spot sooner and put a round on target accurately much better than Soviet/Russian tanks. In the event of a Soviet getting the drop on a Western tank, it was designed to take punishment and also help the crew survive (trained crewmen are VALUABLE). Soviet philosophy was next tank up. Western philosophy was great, keep coming. I’ll kill you, the guy behind you, and the guys behind him. A good example of this is Desert Storm. The US had 27 Abrams tanks destroyed or damaged. TOTAL. Of the 27, only nine were total losses. Of the nine, seven were from friendly fire incidents and the other two were deliberately destroyed after the became disabled. No crew members were KIA either. Obviously, the conflicts are different, but Russia has lost hundreds of tanks in Ukraine along with many of their best trained crews. Western tanks, when manned by trained crews and deployed properly, are much much better than Russian tanks.

They're garbage compared with modern tanks. Weaker armor, slower engines, tight quarters, few countermeasures, basic to nonexistent electronics, Soviet production quality, and on and on. A modern tank could put holes in several older tanks while on the move, probably blowing up their ammo storage along the way, while the older tanks struggle to line up their first shot.

It's also a huge war where there's never enough of everything to go around. Having more tanks means more flexibility, especially on offense. Having better tanks means more of a chance to dominate their engagements.

But because you have a ""big enough gun"" to handle most threats, the Bradley can do lots of things... which almost always end up just being a battlefield taxi (which is important enough of a role).

No, but they also don't have the same capabilities that western tanks do. Doesn't mean they're useless, just that there are contributions western tanks can make that captured (and often old) Russian tanks can't.

We know Russia is committing an enormous amount of man power, especially Wagner recruited prisoners, but so is Ukraine. It's something that's missed in the discussions about the area, people are quick to point out Russia sacrificing dizzying amounts of life to take a place with ""limited strategic value"" but from the Ukrainian sources in that area they are also taking significant losses to defend the place. The U.S. publically stated they'd like to see Ukraine abandon the effort there and prepare for their offensive. Despite this, Zelenskyy just recently announced the defenders in Bakhmut would receive any assistance they need to hold. So what is happening there?  

 This may sound like a cope but I think there is more to the situation. It's fair to assume NATO/the U.S. has a massive influence in the broader strategy of this conflict as evidenced by the in person meetings of high ranking military officials with Ukrainian counterparts/the constant surveillance by NATO aircraft. So why the baffling decision to fight this exhausting, costly battle at Bakhmut and the surrounding villages. I believe this is actually a calculated deception, I don't believe Zelenskyy is just ignoring NATO advisement and sacrificing his country men for a town with a pre war population of less than 100k and no strategic value (beyond the railway access that's ubiquitous throughout Ukraine and the fact it can be used as a staging area for further efforts). I believe Zelenskyy wants to be seen as a fool who has been goaded into a losing battle at Bakhmut that is preventing or delaying their ability to conduct an offensive. This provides the coming Ukrainian offensive, that was presumed to be imminent by everyone, with a degree of surprise.   

  In a world where so much of the battlefield is under surveillance and observation, deceptions such as this are absolutely critical. I could also just be wrong and Bakhmut is just a drain of forces for both militaries but this would more negatively impact the UAF because their manpower is actually meaningful and cannot be squandered like Russia's.",False,1674562307.0,t3_10jwmk5,t1_j5o10xj,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

I think the US is suggesting that Ukraine avoids getting caught in static artillery fights by letting Russia take unimportant ground and strike deep into Russian positions in return to disrupt them.  
Hypothetically a more cohesive, more motivated and more mobile force could rapidly defeat a larger, less coordinated, more stationary force.  
I think Bakhmut use used as an example of a fight that has largely stagnated. If Russian forces were to strike into Ukrainian lines, and Ukraine in turn pushed through weak points in Russia's lines that would provide more opportunities for Ukraine's forces to overrun Russian artillery who's commanders may have fled and to cut off large groups of conscripts that aren't trained how to react to dynamic situations.  


After this type of warfare gets going it could expose the deficiencies of a heavily regimented heavily centralized command structures. The mobile force could cut off large chunks of the opposing army causing mass surrenders.  


I think the reason for trying this type of combat at this time is that it would work better with low numbers of forces on both sides, and there is a risk that with more mobilization there could be just more stuff in the area that could bog down dynamic attacks. I think maybe Russia pulled back from Kherson because they were becoming afraid that they didn't have the concentration of forces to fend of a dynamic opponent.  


I would guess that Russia has expended a lot of its experienced mobile forces, their VDV and recon and tank battalions have taken a lot of damage which would leave them less capable of executing this type of mobile warfare. At the moment their primary strength is being reduced to holding position and lobbing artillery. A maneuver war could potentially rob Russia of their main strength.

I stress they don't mean an actual World War or dragging in other countries, but the type of fighting which accomplishes very little in decisive victories or significantly moving controlled boundaries.  

That's why there's such a big push to provide Ukraine with better equipment and the skills to use it. That's also why there have been some suggestions to at least set the table for diplomacy as diplomacy also takes a very long time to set up properly. The theory is to start preparing now for the potential needs years from now.

It's also important to take into account the 100+ year long history of Russian state oppression in Ukraine. Ukrainian nationalism has existed since the mid 1800's, and Russia has actively worked to crush it since its conception. It's arguable that Ukraine fought - and lost - a war of independence after WWI, when a Ukrainian state briefly existed but was eventually conquered by Soviet Russia.

He does this neat trick where he makes a statement, people ask him to clarify,  and he repeats what he just said with slightly different words. He almost never substantiates his claims.

Source?

There is a huge difference between saying that there is no pressure to make bad choices and saying that Ukraine should make some other choice.

It might be a Zelinsky - Putin pissing contest.  That might actually have strategic significance.  Morale on both Ukraine and Russia's side.  However, Bakhmut has no relevance to aid from the west and Zelinsky throwing away lives wont Impress Americans.  It might have strategic value since Ukraine is going to fight the Russians somewhere anyway.

That is assistance but it is not USA telling Ukraine what to do.  USA is no more in control of Ukraine's army than they are in control of Wagner and the Russian army.

Artillery is also a big issue. In order to advance on Russian defenses, Ukrainian armored formations have to pass through pre-sighted ""kill zones"" where Russia has set up for MSLRs and 152mm arty. These emplacements would not be a big deal for an American force because the US would just use air power to suppress the enemy artillery. Mines aren't a problem because the US forces can just use explosives and take a day or so to pick apart all the safe paths they need through a mine layer, completely free of harassment from enemy artillery.

Ukraine cannot do that. They have to unfortunately send reconnaissance armor ahead into the kill zone, where it usually gets hit hard by artillery. Then the Ukrainians respond with their own counter-battery fire and try to knock out the Russian artillery they've spotted. Rinse and repeat, in a slow, grinding advance that takes weeks unless you get lucky and push through an undefended weakspot like the Balakleya town near Izyum in September.

It's a really sucky situation for anyone in these spearhead formations. If the armor advances upon an area as well-guarded as the Kherson front was in September, then lots of modern tanks will die no matter how well armored they are and no matter how well trained their infantry escorting forces are. It's virtually impossible to advance quickly enough to avoid the enemy artillery fire when you're trying to creep your way through a mine-saturated defensive kill zone.

You can find videos of this tactic on the Kherson front in the fall of 2022. It was absolutely brutal. There are videos of entire Ukrainian infantry platoons and 10+ armored vehicles getting completely wiped off the map in a matter of seconds when the barrage of MRLS lands on top of them. They move slow through gaps in trees and fields, hit a mine, and then everything slows to a crawl and they get slaughtered by the Russian artillery. The same thing will happen to Leopards and Abrams without very, very good SOF reconaissance clearing a path for them ahead of time.",1674580073.0,1674578667.0,t3_10jwmk5,t1_j5p475s,,4,8,0,8,0,0,

Let’s say, for example, that Southwest Airlines (an American budget airline that exclusively operates Boeing 737’s) decides to supplement their fleet with some A320’s.  Sure, they’re both similar planes, but not only do you need an entirely new set of parts to maintain these planes, you now need to train flight attendants, ground crews, and pilots on a new plane that’s completely foreign to them.  Multiply that problem by introducing other planes on top of that like the A220 or 717 and you’ll have some truly miserable ground crews.

link?  Why didn't France join the announcement with the US and Germany then?

> Germany set the condition that they would deliver IFVs if US would also deliver them. It is no coincidence that these announcements were coordinated and announced at the same time.

Just because Germany said they won't donate Marders without other western IFVs being donated does not mean that Bradleys were donated specifically so that Germany would donate Marders.  It's pretty clear there was some collective decision by western countries supporting Ukraine that it was appropriate to start donating IFVs this month.  However if it was the case that Germany was more than willing to donate Marders if only other countries joined in, it begs the question of why those other countries wouldn't join in earlier.  We saw some requests for Marders early on, but those largely died down, and we never saw the same chorus demanding that they donate them like we have with the Leopard 2.

I think it's pretty obvious that Bradleys were donated because the US thought it was the appropriate time to start supplying them, and that ""unlocked"" the Marders, but it wasn't done with the intent of getting Germany to donate them.  On the other hand, the donations of western tanks other than Leopard 2's seem to truly be token donations - Challenger 2's will never be donated in large numbers due to a lack of inventory, [Abrams may be 8+ months out](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1618005978741637125), and I haven't seen any announcement of Leclerc's, but those also have inventory issues.

In the absence of available Marders, Bradleys still would have been sent, thus this statement is false.

And the Challengers are a single company - 3 platoons of 4, plus 2 for command.  This seems to be the smallest amount that could be donated while still being effective, and the prospects of further Challenger donations are somewhat limited (and are incapable of meeting Ukraine's needs due to lack of numbers), making this a token donation.  Meanwhile there may be 100+ Leopard 2's donated by various European operators out of the gate, with the possibility of additional donations in the future.  So while the quantity may match what individual countries are donating, the Challengers will likely remain unicorns in Ukraine's tank fleet, with the 14 Leopards donated by Germany becoming part of a much larger fleet.

As far as Abrams go, Hertling's estimate of 8 months carries some weight given his experience with them, and given reporting we've seen so far (that they will be paid for with USAI funds instead of being in a PDA package), I think he's right.  USAI means that the Abrams cannot coming from existing inventories, and so will instead need to be built (well actually refurbished from storage).  This will take time, while the Leopards to be donated in the initial wave are coming straight from existing stocks.

Basically there's plenty of options for decent quantities of IFVs that can be made available quickly without Germany, but the Leopard 2 is the sole tank that can be supplied in any quantity on short notice (ignoring funding sources, no Abrams export customer has been permitted to purchase the tanks with the DU armor the US Army equips its tanks with, excepting Poland, so those tanks would not be provided).",False,1674616810.0,t3_10jwmk5,t1_j5rp9f7,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

There is a form you need to submit, to a specific authority through a specific channel. That makes it a formal request. That form might be filled in incompletely and/or incorrectly, but its submission is sufficient to be considered a formal request, and the response might be a rejection (due to incompleteness or incorrectness) or a request for more information.
