Day 5 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Attacks are getting more barbaric by the day. Today was probably the deadliest day in Kharkiv for civilians, living district was carpet bombed and at least 11 people died, streets are full of craters from explosions some missiles didn’t explode and now they are sticking out of the ground in the streets, some of them even lodged in inside people’s homes in apartment buildings.

Good news is that apparently there are still supplies in stores and water vending machines actually have water filters, so the water is being purified in real time, it takes longer to actually fill bottles but at least it’s drinkable.

The bad news is that it’s actually a real challenge to get inside the stores, the queues are long, if you don’t go just as they are opening you will probably have to wait for multiple hours or even worse – you won’t get inside at all as today curfew started at 3 pm, so most stores closed at 1:30 pm, people almost got into fights at the doors as security didn’t let anyone in even when there was still more than 30 minutes until store closing. People need food and water so if the trend of not letting people in continues then it’s very probable they will try to fight their way in.

As usual shelling was very intense, and we had to go inside our bathroom multiple times as that’s where there are the most walls in our home and they are the thickest.

With each explosion your body experiences some kind of primal fear, vibrations go throughout your whole body and even inside your bones it’s something you wouldn’t really experience anywhere else, you feel like you have absolutely no control about anything and your limbs start to feel numb, it’s like your body doesn’t listen to you.

Now pretty much any moderately loud sound sends your body into alert mode, you start to feel panic, and the fear sets in. You also start to feel or even hear vibrations that you never felt before from ordinary things like just water running from tap. At this point I don’t even know if people here will ever recover from this perpetual fear, a lot of people are hiding in basements, some saw shells explode right before them, some even seen people die right before their eyes. 

From the people that we were standing in queues with its apparent that now pretty much everyone here absolutely hates russians and wants to have no business with them, not now, not ever. So much death and destruction, some people lost their homes, some lost their families, and for what?

Per Forbes, this is a description of a thermobaric explosion:

“The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique–and unpleasant…. What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs…. If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel.

> 
> The likely postponement of the mission is a result of European Union sanctions placed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Civil space cooperation between Russia and Western countries has for decades progressed in spite of areas of conflict on the ground. But the military conflict in Ukraine has interfered with both sides’ ability to compartmentalize what happens in space from what occurs on the planet’s surface.
> 
> The ExoMars mission, which includes a robotic rover built by the European Space Agency bundled with a landing platform supplied by Russia, was expected to launch in the fall of this year from a Russian-owned spaceport in Kazakhstan. In 2023, the two partners would then attempt a landing which included a rover, Rosalind Franklin, which is named for an English scientist who helped discover DNA.
> 
> But in a brief statement deploring the “human casualties and tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine,” ESA, a group of 22 European states, said “the sanctions and the wider context make a launch in 2022 very unlikely.”
> 
> The ESA statement makes all but certain another delay of at least two years for the ExoMars mission, which was designed to traverse the Martian surface to look for clues to potential ancient life with cameras, sensors and a drill. Journeys to Mars typically launch during a window approximately every two years when the red planet comes into alignment with Earth, allowing a shorter journey. Funding and engineering issues had previously delayed the mission from a 2018 launch. The Covid-19 pandemic and technical problems spurred the mission’s most recent delay in 2020.

Based on Wikipedia numbers this is the deadliest per day conflict that Russia has been involved in since WW2.

Right now, if the numbers provided by the UKR number are correct UKR has killed over 5000 Russian invaders in five days which means around 1000 Russians killed per day. This is how it compares to previous Russian wars post ww2(i took highest casualty estimates from wikipedia):

* Soviet invasion of afghanistan (most unpopular and deadliest conflict post ww2 in Russia): 26000 dead in 10 years which means approx 8 dead Russians per day
* First Chechen war: 14000 dead in 2 years which means approx 20 dead Russians per day
* Second Chechen war: 7200 dead in 2 years which means approx 10 dead Russians per day.

And the major fighting in the main ukr cities hasn't happened yet and I think the numbers will explode when they do and in two days the numbers would approx the same as the numbers of the second cehchen war.

This is 100% gonna cause lots and lots of turmoil in Russian society by itself if the numbers get out even excluding the financial penalties. Present day Russians are a lot less willing to take this type of things than Russians living under communism and even they were against wars such as the Afghanistan war. Most importantly Putin doesn't have the same level of repression tools as his soviet counterparts. He can't put millions of people in gulags like Stalin  its just not going to happen and the army and police aren't as brainwashed and loyal as they were during soviet times.

> Long thread about how I think the first 96 hours have gone, still very early/incomplete impressions. The initial Russian operation was premised on terrible assumptions about Ukraine’s ability & will to fight, and an unworkable concept of operations. Moscow badly miscalculated. 1/

> The Russian operation was focused on getting to Kyiv quickly, forcing a surrender, and pushing a small number of units forward quickly in a way that avoided large engagements with UKR forces. They’ve been skirting major cities, going for key road junctions/smaller towns, etc. 2/

> Why did Moscow choose this course of action? A few theories: they didn’t take Ukraine & its military seriously. They wanted to avoid attrition & devastation because of consequences for pol goals in Ukraine, costs of casualties, and they want to hide the costs from the public. 3/

> It is also possible that Russian military planners genuinely wanted to avoid inflicting high levels of destruction given how unpopular this war was going to be at home. Most Russian soldiers are young & have little interest in fighting Ukrainians as an opponent. 4/

> What I’ve seen so far suggests that Russian troops were unaware they would be ordered to invade, and appear reluctant to prosecute this war. They don't see Ukrainians as adversaries and the military didn’t prepare them for this campaign. Outside of Chechens, morale seems low. 5/

> This is an unworkable concept of operations. It seems they tried to win quickly and cheaply via 'thunder runs,' hoping to avoid the worst of sanctions & Western outrage. They’ve ended up in the worst of all worlds, trickling more resources into a failed strategy. 6/

> However, this is barely a few days into the war. Ukraine has done remarkably well, but no analysts (except maybe in Moscow) expected Russia to defeat  the largest country in Europe within 4 days, especially given UKR military capability. 7/

> On the shambolic effort - Russian units are not really fighting as BTGs. They’re driving down roads in small detachments, pushing recon & VDV units forward. Tanks often by themselves and vice versa. Fires & enablers not used decisively, and often not used at all. 8/

> Outside of the fighting NW of Kyiv we have a lot of smaller detachments, tanks, IFVs, often recon or VDV units pressing down roads & into cities. Small formations regularly outrunning logistics, without support, or letting support & artillery get ambushed behind them. 9/

> Beyond large numbers of units strewn out in small detachments & checkpoints, we have the inverse situation as well. Long trains of Russian vehicles stuck in their own traffic jams, entering across the border. Air defenses not covering them, but stuck on the road with them. 10/

> As companies & platoons run ahead to seize points, logistics can’t keep up, and they’re not being effectively covered by support. Most of the fights I've seen are small skirmishes, especially on the outskirts of major cities. These may be intense, but not major battles. 11/

> The Russian failure is driven by the fact that they’re attempting to conduct a full-scale invasion without the mil operation that it would require, thinking they can avoid most of the fighting. This has led to not only unworkable force employment, but lack of employment. /12

> The truth is that large parts of the Russian military have yet to enter this war, with many of the capabilities still unused. Not to take away from UKR great mil performance, and resilience, but I see a lot of early judgments & conclusions that need moderation. 13/

> In the first 4 days, Russian tactical aviation, except for some Su-25s, largely sat on the sidelines. So have most combat helicopters. They have hundreds of both deployed in the area. Russia's air force is missing in action, and largely unused. 14/

> The Russian military sought to use cruise/ballistic missiles to destroy/suppress UKR air defense and target air bases. However, they're not flying CAPs, or offensive counter air, and only today have I spotted the first Su-34 bomber conducting strikes. /15

> Except for heavy shelling around Kharkiv, use of fires have been limited compared to how the Russian mil typically operates. Sadly, I think this will change. Russian mil is an artillery army first, and it has used a fraction of its available fires in this war thus far. /16

> The bulk of the Russian military has yet to enter the fight. Outside Kharkiv, most of the 1st Guards Tank Army, and 20th Army, are just sitting there. They pushed a few BTGs a considerable distance past Sumy, but I think a lot of Russia's forces are still on the sidelines. /17

> Another point, Russian losses are significant, and they have had a number of troops captured, but they have been advancing along some axes. In general, Ukrainians are posting evidence of their combat successes, but the opposite is less true, distorting the overall picture. 18/

> Hence my next thought. In a desperate effort to keep the war hidden from the Russian public, framing this as a Donbas operation, Moscow has completely ceded the information environment to Ukraine, which has galvanized morale and support behind Kyiv. Another miscalculation. /19

> I won't comment on the host of official claims made in this war so far, except that I think Kyiv is doing a great job shaping perceptions & the information environment. That said, folks should approach official claims critically in a time of war. /20

> Looking at the military effort, I think Russian forces are getting some basics really wrong, but we're also learning things that are probably not true about the Russian military as well. They're not really fighting the way they train and organize for a major conventional war. /21

> The assumptions have Grozny 1994 vibes, while some of the operations remind me of classic mil org driven blunders. Sending airborne air assault brigades or naval infantry in early on to 'do their thing,' even though it is unnecessary, risky, or impractical. /22

> What's next? Russia's political leadership is still not conceding their plan's failure, trying to take Kyiv quickly. But we're seeing them open up greater use of fires, strikes, and air power. Sadly, I expect the worst is yet ahead, and this war could get a lot more ugly. /23

> I was going to add, that I've seen and read other explainer threads out there about the Russian military failure. I differ with some of those explanations, they're generally not coming from Russia mil experts, and 4 days into a war might be a bit early for conclusive statements.

> Also, looking at day 5, seeing major adjustments. Russian military is suspending unsupported thunder runs, resupplying, and reorganizing.

Illiberal democracy describes Turkey quite well, yes, though that looks like it's going to get better. Opposition parties have managed to finally stop sniping at each other and creating a functioning alliance and stop alienating the half of the population that votes for Erdoğan because they see him to be the lesser evil by changing the tone of their politics. Along with the recent economic struggles due to Erdonomics and the increasing perception of Erdoğan losing touch with the ordinary people and becoming what he came into power with the promise of eradicating, Erdoğan's support has vaned a lot. Polls show him to lose against almost any major opposition figure, some almost 70/30.

Recently the major opposition alliance expanded from 3 parties to 6, and recently released ""Reinforced Parliamentary System Consensus"" covering the reforms they would undertake after they come into power. Note that I wrote ""after"", not ""if"". This is a very important distinction because for years opposition had no hope of ever getting to the government so they didn't even try, but now they are confident that they will win. Polls agree with them too as the opposition alliance seem tohandily beat out Erdoğan's alliance (and yes, he could only win the last elections by making an alliance with the extreme-right party) and come near the 50% mark. Considering that the Kurdish party HDP consistently gets 10-12% of the votes every election with no expectation for that to change, the elections couldn't come sooner for Turkey.

If you'd like to read the consensus, you can use Google Translate on [this page](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/2022/gundem/ankarada-tarihi-gun-alti-muhalefet-lideri-bir-arada-6979779/)",False,1646087660.0,t3_t3rvl4,t3_t3rvl4,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

Additionally, this means they underestimated how much time Ukraine would have to arm and mobilise its citizens, as well as how much western military aid would be flowing in.

a6eabe054086acb2122a1ec1bdfd6e38,t3rvl4,hyua7w3,"Thermobaric bombs. Fire and explosions of the conventional  variety require 2 things. 

Fuel and Oxygen. How powerful your explosion is depends on how quick you can get the Oxygen and fuel to react. In a campfire, wood (carbon) oxidizes with normal air and slowly burns. Due to the fact the air is only around 20 % oxygen, air only comes into contact with the wood on the very outside of the log, wood isn't entirely pure carbon, this takes time. 

In a crude rocket motor, you need the reaction to be faster than a campfire. So you decide to make your fuel very fine. Sugar in this example. Now, the air can touch all sides of very small sugar crystals and oxidize. But you have a problem. It's all in a pile, and only the top of the pile is touching the air.

This is where oxidizers come in. If you had oxygen trapped in small sugar sized crystals that released when heated, you could mix your sugar with oxygen without needing air. We will use potassium nitrate, or saltpeter. 

Now to take it further, we can melt our oxidizer (oxygen) and sugar(fuel) separately and mix them together below combustion point. It's an even mix of fuel and oxygen, (much more than in the air), so it burns incredible quick. All the sugar is already touching the oxygen in solid form, so once it gets the heat to break the bonds it breaks down and oxidizes instantly. If you could oxidize a campfire log, it would behave the same way. 

That is a conventional bomb. 

Thermobarics take a different approach. Because you would need so much air to make an explosion, most bombs just take the oxygen then need with them. Thermobarics take only the fuel, and a small separate conventional bomb. If you have very combustible fuel, with the right mix of fuel and air you can achieve detonation. This is why you only fill your car up with fuel and not oxygen. 


But there's already air where your bomb is going to be, why was weight taking it. All we need is air and fuel to be touching. The way we did it before, was taking all that air in solid form and squishing into our fuel. 

In a thermobaric bomb, the opposite happens. Instead of taking oxygen to the fuel, we take fuel to oxygen. if we take gasoline and vaporize it, we know it explodes. Thats what these do. They use a small normal explosive to blast all fuel out of the bomb into a large cloud of mist/vapor with a shockwave, and since fuel vapor is just tiny tiny drops of fuel touching a whole lot of air.... it detonates. 

Not only does this mean you can increase power to size ratio of your bomb by not needing to take oxygen with you, the area that the explosion comes from is much much larger. A normal explosion comes from the usually solid fuel, a very small area. Devastating close by, but that fades quickly. 

A thermobaric has a large source of explosion, as you are detonating a large cloud of fuel. So instead of coming from something the size of a coffee mug, it's coming from something the size of the house. This rapid expansion of air creates a massive shockwave, liquifying soft tissue from much MUCH further than a conventional weapon. 

That's why they are banned. Because the kill radius is huge. Its the devastation of a micro nuke with none of the radiation.

NATO is in a very dangerous place as we can’t stop Russia because they just may be crazy enough to end the world if they feel ousted by the rest of the world.

Facts are facts sometimes they are in you favor sometimes they don't either way you should accept them as they are. Ukraine is fake coutry with fake history and fake language. And this is Fact! The fact that you rename yourselfs, (like you for example from Александер то Олександр), changing your language, and reclaiming history from Russia is proving that you are fake country. The name Украйна come from У краина (or people who live near the border in this case in Russia) and somehow Lenin decided to create you as a soviet state is really just a historical mistake on his part that now US is benefiting from by making you kill your own brothers on the Donbass. Because no people who live in Donbass want to attack those who live in Kiyv or Lvov, but the oposite. They are fighing for their homes, you are fighting them to take them under control. And the most sad thing is that you probably know all of this better than me, but yet still the divide and conquer propaganda of the west reached out you. Of course I admit the awful atrocities during the soviet times and especially by Stalin against people who live in todays Ukraine and this is the perfect weapon for the West to turn you against todays Russia. It is strange because nobody is blaming Merkel for Hitlers policies, but everybody blames Putin for Stalin policies ... funny right? The Fact is that west is always united against the estern european countries and use their historical problems to divide them and then they conquer them one by one. Just look what happen to your country you are now worst than Moldova and it is world laughing stock with Poroshenko and now Zelensky ... is this is what you dreamed for? Look at the situation and the results now, forget about politics and bs propaganda ....

4ffaff3dafe3f42d5c179333017ae617,t3rvl4,hyuitmf,"I truly believe that Ukraine cannot be occupied long-term either by Russian forces directly or as a Russian puppet state, given the massive popular mobilization against the invading military that we are seeing. However, it would be overly optimistic to assume we won't see some short-term Russian victories in the coming days and weeks.

Yes, Russian soldiers are poorly trained with low morale and yes, their equipment is outdated and subpar. But they have a lot of soldiers and a lot of equipment when compared to the Ukrainians (at least for now) and in a war of attrition, the number of guns and bodies you can throw at a specific piece of geography matters. Also, don't think that the Russian military isn't seeing the shortfalls in their current strategy and adapting it. The Russian military is not controlled by a buggy video game AI that repeats the same maneuvers over and over regardless of efficacy. They are already changing the playbook by putting greater emphasis on indiscriminate aerial bombardments to soften up key urban targets, with no regard for civilian casualties. Tank and infantry will follow into these bombed out areas and try to wipe out any remaining resistance.

Russian forces are trying to bisect the country from the north and south to cut off a significant chunk of the Ukrainian Army in the east. They are also trying to seize control of key command components, Zelenskyy, and Ukrainian gov officials by taking over Kyiv. But so what if that happens? The headquarters of the Ukrainian resistance will just regroup in Lviv. And if Lviv falls, then in Poland. Remember, even if Russian force succeed in some of their initial strategic objectives, the anti-Russian insurgency is just beginning. With the full financial and tactical support of EU and NATO, and the availability of strategic safe havens within neighboring countries, it is not going away.

Ukraine also has the home turf advantage when it comes to small arms engagements (knowledge of terrain, ability to blend in to the populace, ability to set up ambushes). Having been denied the easy early victory they expected, it makes tactical sense for Russia to focus on bombing areas to smithereens before they send in the actual troops. It's not like they give a shit about civilian casualties. This means the real test that determines the length of this war and, consequently, the amount of Ukrainian casualties, will be Russia's willingness and ability to use artillery, rockets, and missile systems.

But bombs are expensive. SUPER expensive.

For example, the US Army's 2018 unit cost for the Javelin weapon system was over $200,000. And that is just an man-portable anti-tank missile, not an MLRS or large missiles dropped from planes (though I am sure our defense contractors upcharge considerably.) I don't know how many heavy armaments the Russians currently have stored and stockpiled, nor do I know at what speed they can replace what they are using. However, I would bet that it isn't as much as they need to subdue every city in Ukraine. And I would bet some of the components for them are pretty hard to come by in light of the current sanctions. I would also bet that NATO does have pretty reasonable estimates of Russian capabilities in that sector, and is definitely sharing their assessments with Ukrainian troops.

Again, I don't think Russia will be able to hold Ukrainian territory long-term, given the resolve of the Ukrainian people. It is going to be bloody, terrible fighting going forward in the next days, and civilians and infrastructure will bear the brunt of it. Things are probably going to look pretty dark for a while, but keep in mind in the coming weeks if things look bleak, the Ukrainian military and resistance will have the world's deepest pockets at their back, and the Russian Army will decidedly not.",False,1646093212.0,t3_t3rvl4,t3_t3rvl4,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia ups the violence and manpower and eventually takes Kyiv.  

BUT

I still don't think Russia will take all of Ukraine. We all know from their showing so far that they would struggle enough holding anything east of the Dneiper. That would keep them busy enough, and they'd still have Crimea, Donbass, a land bridge, and a buffer from NATO.

There were also those state media clips circulating a bit back where they were openly discussing how to divide Ukraine. Plus I believe Putin himself has noted that Ukraine has many other ethnic groups out west thanks to historical connections with like Romania. While I'm sure he'd love to take it all, I'm sure by now he knows he needs to claim some, ANY victory, and taking Kyiv and the east probably does that in his head. Probably comes away with that and regroups before doing anything else. Figure out how to circumvent the sanctions before making another move.

Taking all of this into account, this probably stops with Kyiv...which remains horribly sad.

Here goes:

As an Indian, i partially agree. India isn't siding with anyone because we can't. It's complicated geopolitics. We are surrounded by countries that are either Russia or US supporting and our borders have literally been in constant skirmishes since ages. The last thing India needs is aggression from either side. The PM, although I'm not a fan, has spoken to both zelensky and Putin urging to resolve the matter peacefully.

Now, there ARE extreme nationalist groups that are cheering Russia on. But that's fuelled by misinformation and the fact that Russia has always been an ally. 

Also, even though I sympathize greatly with Ukrainians, them beating up Indian citizens/immigrants, mostly students who are set up in camps or are looking to leave like many others, that's fucked up and won't help.

Before everyone yells at me for wanting to start WWIII, that is highly unlikely to happen. First, this involvement would only be limited to air engagements, not ground troops. At worst, we will be having dogfights against Russian jets. Second, the Russians haven't mobilized enough ground troops for a major war on NATO. If they intended to use war as a threat to prevent NATO involvement, they would have placed their reserve forces on the border with NATO.  They would lose a ground war, badly.

If we capitulate, he will continue using the threat of nuclear weapons for everything he wants.

>Day 5 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.
>
>Attacks are getting more barbaric by the day. Today was probably the deadliest day in Kharkiv for civilians, living district was carpet bombed and at least 11 people died, streets are full of craters from explosions some missiles didn’t explode and now they are sticking out of the ground in the streets, some of them even lodged in inside people’s homes in apartment buildings.
>
>Good news is that apparently there are still supplies in stores and water vending machines actually have water filters, so the water is being purified in real time, it takes longer to actually fill bottles but at least it’s drinkable.
>
>The bad news is that it’s actually a real challenge to get inside the stores, the queues are long, if you don’t go just as they are opening you will probably have to wait for multiple hours or even worse – you won’t get inside at all as today curfew started at 3 pm, so most stores closed at 1:30 pm, people almost got into fights at the doors as security didn’t let anyone in even when there was still more than 30 minutes until store closing. People need food and water so if the trend of not letting people in continues then it’s very probable they will try to fight their way in.
>
>As usual shelling was very intense, and we had to go inside our bathroom multiple times as that’s where there are the most walls in our home and they are the thickest.
>
>With each explosion your body experiences some kind of primal fear, vibrations go throughout your whole body and even inside your bones it’s something you wouldn’t really experience anywhere else, you feel like you have absolutely no control about anything and your limbs start to feel numb, it’s like your body doesn’t listen to you.
>
>Now pretty much any moderately loud sound sends your body into alert mode, you start to feel panic, and the fear sets in. You also start to feel or even hear vibrations that you never felt before from ordinary things like just water running from tap. At this point I don’t even know if people here will ever recover from this perpetual fear, a lot of people are hiding in basements, some saw shells explode right before them, some even seen people die right before their eyes. 
>
>From the people that we were standing in queues with its apparent that now pretty much everyone here absolutely hates russians and wants to have no business with them, not now, not ever. So much death and destruction, some people lost their homes, some lost their families, and for what?

In this thread, I'll be summarizing an interview with Vladimir Trukhan, a Colonel who serves at the Central Office of the Ministry of Defense of Russia. Obviously, it's heavy on Russian propaganda, but I think it's still helpful to understand a few things & the RU perspective.

“There are no conscripts in the military operation. Only trained professionals. That's why Belarus doesn't participate, their army is all conscripts. So if someone is squealing about ‘corpses of Russian conscripts’, you can spit in his face.”

“The Ukrainian number of 3500 Russians KIA is ridiculous. Such a number of dead would mean several times the number of wounded, which means that all roads would be jammed with ambulances, plus mass deployment of field hospitals — it would be impossible to hide this.”

“The cases of solitary Russian POWs, which Banderite propaganda spins, are unlikely: an AWOL soldier who went to a neighboring village to buy moonshine could be captured, but he is not a fighter, he is a laggard. Single soldiers don't break away during fights.”


“Incidents of convoys being burned on the march are possible, it's war, things happen. Someone made a mistake, didn't keep track, had to abandon vehicles with empty tanks. We assume that the abandoned convoys are being burned by the AFU retroactively for staged videos.”

“The same with ‘supplies that'll last only 3-4 days’; a fairy tale of nonsense. Military operations of this level are prepared for at least several months, everything is calculated and stockpiled in advance with excessive redundancy for all cases.”

“The main idea of the Russian Army is ‘we are not Americans’. They are the ones who, when they see something or someone in their way, first throw a grenade and then ask questions. Nobody is going to produce mountains of corpses, if a person does not offer resistance, why shoot?”

“Handing out weapons to the unprepared population, as well as all sorts of ‘Molotov cocktails’ against professionals, is ridiculous idiocy. Three or four stun grenades is enough to make them shit themselves on the spot, drop their weapons and run away.”


“The Kadyrovtsy, specifically trained to deal with terrorists in urban environments, will mop up the Nazis.”

“Russian forces participating in the operation do not use mortars. All mortar shelling in residential areas, especially in senseless places, where there is no military or energy infrastructure, are provocations by the AFU & terrorists in order to influence the local population.”

“To summarize, there are no non-professionals in the operation. The operation was prepared well in advance in all respects and the plan has a lot of ramifications for all kinds of events.”",False,1646089433.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyu9uhx,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Clearly merchants/retailers are using it just fine. virtually no risk. read on.

This misinformation that ""it's risky for the buyer because it takes hours to settle"" is just FUD. The only circumstance this would make ANY sense is for someone trying to send multi-millions if not billions to someone, only then would it make any sense whatsoever to convince miners to reverse the transaction but that still requires more than 50% of the total mining hashrate to collaborate which they just wouldn't do.

Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector [houses] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.”

British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.

In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”

Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.

As the footage gets back to the Russian people, the narrative that this is a peacekeeping mission becomes more farcical. He is clearly worried about this as he has escalated the censorship of social media. Even a quick would have resulted in an endless insurgency as you said.

As if this isn't enough, the last piston of the Russian economy is selling resources to China. China have price control and I would imagine they will plunder Russia's resources at cut prices.

I figure after march 3rd, after Anonymous empties all the bank accounts of the Russian people(mind you, Putin is rumored to be thinking of doing the exact same thing, now that his $600B nest egg is frozen), there will be widespread calls for Putin to be removed.  Plus, the limits placed on withdrawals at Russian banks, roughly $20, make getting everything out close to impossible.  

We are closer to where the world was with Stalin at the end of his life: there is literally one person in Russia with all the power.  Once he's dead, either by one of his advisors making an Operation Valkyrie play, or the citizens of Moscow tearing him apart after storming the capitol, there will be a power vacuum unlike anything we've ever seen.  NATO will likely have to be called in as a peacekeeping force.  We are watching a major state collapse in on itself.  There isn't a precedent.  Unlike Stalin's death, there is no one to turn to(short of Nalvany, and he's been Putin's ""guest"" in prison, *if* he's still alive) when Putin is gone: there's no heir-apparent, no one waiting in the wings to save the country.  Putin has set himself up as the sole leader, and purged any possibility of another candidate to rule.

A few days before the invasion they were saying the US was exaggerating for saying Russia would invade. So right now there are 6,000 Chinese citizens stuck in the Ukraine because China didn't tell them to leave. 

However, they don't fundamentally oppose the invasion either. Likely this is because they see a similarity with Putin's position on Ukraine being an integral part of Russia, and their own notion that Taiwan is an integral part of China. There's been some talk/speculation that China is getting ready to invade Taiwan in the coming years, after they have built up enough capability to do so. However, China also has a longstanding history of noninterference in global affairs that aren't in their direct interest.

As the war has progressed, China has backpedaled a little, or as they would characterize it, ""nuanced"", their position. They have called for Russia to negotiate a peace, and they have declared that all sovereign states should have their integrity respected. Also, they clearly were not happy with Putin's veiled threat about nuclear bombs. It's unlikely though any direct action will come from the Chinese. Perhaps if Putin were to directly threaten the use of a nuclear bomb, they would join diplomatic sanctions, but so far they are staying out of it.

Lastly, China has said that the Western sanctions are counter productive and not helpful. Probably because they see ""sanctions"" as a western expression of power which they oppose in general.

So as per usual, they are doing their own thing. They probably would have been fine if Russia could have done this military action quickly, but now that they have united the EU, NATO and other parts of the world against Russia, they are probably not very happy. Also they are probably looking very hard at the effect of social media and a conventional war, and how a globally connected population starts to empathize with one another, driving the harshness of sanctions and unity of response on an institutional level, and are thinking very hard that the first thing they need to do when invading Taiwan, is to cut/bomb the internet cables connecting the island.",False,1646091499.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyud7x7,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

>The [blast] kill mechanism against living targets is unique—and unpleasant. ... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction [vacuum], which ruptures the lungs. ... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as with most chemical agents.

>According to a US Central Intelligence Agency study,[15] ""the effect of an FAE explosion within confined spaces is immense. Those near the ignition point are obliterated. Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that, because the ""shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate"".[16]

Up until this point, however, Putin has not physically attacked us. Thus, us getting involved by intervening would be *us* escalating. That's exactly what we want to avoid. We do far better by pressuring him in a measured way. 

If he pushes it to war, that's on him. But war is something we should do everything to avoid and only embrace if it's thrust upon us against our wills.",False,1646092521.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyugxa8,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Those are ballistic missiles with a huge range and Ukraine does not have anything do shoot those down with. They are very expensive though so you dont shoot it at non important targets.

Also Russian airforce has not been at display here with their new jets.

That said, this is something you are going to need to prepare for. Barring some top Russian officials assassinating Putin, the tides in this are going to turn at some point. Kyiv will likely fall (no prediction on when), as well as the other major cities, and the Ukrainian force will need to morph into a more guerrilla style resistance. At the same time Russia will create a puppet government in Ukraine that the west will refuse to recognize. This will the turn into Russia needing to maintain an occupying force for multiple years while the Ukrainian resistance continues to hit them and inflict casualties. All of which will cost Russia billions that it doesn’t have. This will all happen while the wests sanctions stay in place and completely decimate the Russia economy, but at no point will you see NATO troops in Ukraine. 

That’s all to say that this situation is going to get much worse before it gets better. BUT this situation is also not winnable for Russia. They can’t weather the sanctions long enough to actually put down the resistance force so that they can remove their occupying force, which will continue to suck their economy dry.

At this point that's also clearly an unnecessary step, because who is going to want to start selling stuff in rubles if they're not in Russia?

So it would largely be the same situation - there's no way the CBR could buy enough DOGE to cover the value of everyone's rubles. Everyone with rubles would still be left with far less DOGE then they would need if they wanted the equivalent value of the rubles before it crashed.

However: The nazi claims are based somewhat in reality. The [Azov Battalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azov_Battalion) has some rather loud and flagrant members who openly support Nazi heroes, principles, and ideals. The group itself is an official recognized element of the UA military, and as such, there is tacit approval of the pro-Nazi sentiments of some of its members.

This is equivalent to: if the US Army had a National Guard unit where one in ten members was openly KKK, and if the US Army/US Gov't did nothing about it, it could be implied that the US Army/Gov't actively supported white supremacists and the KKK.

Ukraine is not overrun with neo-Nazis, but there are neo-Nazi elements in official positions in the country. I firmly believe that Ukraine is objectively ""good"" right now, but in a binary classification of ""good"" vs. ""evil,"" we lose the shades of gray that reflect the actual state of the world. And that's UA right now. They've got some stains on their record, absolutely. But literally every polity in history--without exception--has similar stains, some worse than others. In the grand scheme of things, Ukraine's flaws aren't nearly as existence-threatening as Russia's propaganda machine is trying to make us believe.

He’s spent the last 20 years weakening Russian democracy. I don’t think he fears being replaced in the slightest when he just poisoned one of his political rivals a couple years ago and faced zero consequences for it. So being replaced is not something he has to worry about. He can afford to think in terms of the long game and he clearly has so far.

I think annexing Crimea was 100% dipping his toes in to test the waters. He watched as administrations changed and built everything up to be able to invade Ukraine this year.

I don’t know how this will end but I think we’re at a point where everyone is still optimistic about Ukraine surviving this (and I hope they do) but the bulk of the Russian military has not shown up yet.

I don’t think he would go against NATO countries first but I don’t blame Poland for taking this very seriously at all.

I think he’ll go over smaller countries like Moldova next. There’s no way this ends at Ukraine unless Crimea is taken back and he’s not allowed to annex more of Ukraine. I think he’ll eventually look to Finland at some point (he just threatened them not even a week ago). 

It’s not suicidal at all. Look how timid everyone is being when he waves his nukes around. Putin will continue down this path so long as he can keep it at engagements with one country at a time. I don’t doubt that at all. He will avoid a World War for as long as he can but that will obviously change if he ever goes after Poland.

yes, sounds logical to me, this isnt about Ukraine, its about restoring the old soviet union to its former glory, hell... some people would argue its not even the old soviet union Putin is aiming, he wants to bring back the old [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), sounds a little crazy, isnt it? while its obvious he wont be able to take back all of those states, he might be able to take a few if not unchecked, last guy who attempted this is well known, his name was Hitler, either way, Russia has already throw threats agaisnt EU members such as Poland.


> Putin is an authoritarian thug who illegally and needlessly invaded Ukraine, but he’s not suicidal. He doesn’t want to get into a shooting war with nato and from what we’re seeing we all know Russia can’t occupy multiple countries on multiple fronts. Let’s all keep our heads here and not get paranoid about Putin trying to conquer Europe.

Putin is a thug, thats right, and he might not be suicidal, but he's not the same Putin we know, dont believe me? believe someone who has inside info, [here's](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1497968757091807234) a tweet for you, whether you like the guy or not, one thing is clear, he's giving us deep insight, accurate intel, and he's being honest for once, then look at [this](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1497393912821915648), there have been multiple rumors long before the invasion about Putin's health, there's also reports he isolated himself during covid times, the whole ""I wish I could share more"" means there's more info but its classified, its likely they know exactly whats going on with Putin but they cant share it because the amount of people who knows is so small it could compromise a mole, as far as I know, non-NATO countries have received classified info from NATO and they change their stances right away from ""we're neutral"" to ""lets impose sanctions"", its likely they want to stay alive, by choking Russia's economy people might turn their back to Putin and do whats right, not to go fully suicidal.


> It’s especially disheartening to hear politicians such as congressmen and other world leaders spout off this nonsense. It really feels like their trying to whip up fears to get the public to agree to more unnecessary defense spending.

as far as I can see, politicians are acting like adults for once, they sharing a lot of information, keep in mind Putin is old, like really old, he's 70 yo, if he's actually sick he might want to cement his legacy, thats why he needs to do something so radical, Politicians know more than us, we are just average people.


> And to my disappointment it seems to be working with even countries like Germany (under a social democrat like Scholz none the less!) promising to spend an insane 100 billion euros on defense.


every country should have the means to protect themselves, Germany has made so many bad choices that made them Russia-dependant, as someone from North America, I personally believe Germany needs to have their own military, the world cant trust the US when its shifting power every 2 to 4 years, if Ukraine is to be accepted to be part of EU, then Europe might be going to war with Russia without the US, so they need to ramp up their military.

0fd5281719cb2134ec6a935143110d2f,t3rvl4,hyuc9v5,"The satellite images showed a vast Russian convoy bogged down on the road to Kyiv.

Military experts said the column stretching up to 17 miles was a sitting duck for Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes. About 20 miles from where it was last spotted, the Russian advance appeared to have hit a wall.

In Bucha, 15 miles north-west of Kyiv, images posted online showed the bloody aftermath of one of the most brutal ambushes and firefights of the five-day-old war.

In Kyiv itself, Russian special forces troops were halted by guards at one of the city’s most famous religious landmarks. A photograph showed what appeared to be a Russian corpse lying close to St Michael’s Golden-Domed Monastery, while the local orthodox archbishop issued a statement claiming the “saboteurs” had been “neutralised”.

As talks were taking place just across the border in Belarus, Russian troops faced being massacred on the roads into the capital. If Russians were being killed by church guards, the resistance could clearly be no pushover.

On Monday, there were reports of loud explosions on the edge of the Kyiv as the Russian army attempted to make its move on the capital.

However, the evidence of the fight it faced was highlighted by mobile phone footage of the mangled wreckage of tanks and armoured personnel carriers in Bucha’s residential quarter.

About 15 vehicles had been destroyed along with much of a half-mile section of the street. Trees and houses that lined the road had disappeared in the explosions.

“Look what they did to my home, but we gave as good as we got and now all that’s left of the invader is spare parts,” said one resident, giving a running commentary on mobile phone footage in reference to the remnants of tanks and other Russian kit. He could have been talking about body parts, too. Other videos showed the corpses of Russian troops.

Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector [houses] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.”

British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.

In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”

Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.

The north-west route into Kyiv from the Belarus border via the wastelands of the radioactive Chernobyl nuclear power plant had been key to Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a speedy end to a conflict that threatens to drag on for weeks, maybe longer.

Ukraine is being rearmed by the West, while the Russian advance on the capital appears, at least for now, to have stalled.

Russia’s military leaders had planned a lightning attack by seizing control of Hostomel airport and the spot where the convoy was wiped out. Special forces had claimed control of the airfield in the first hours of fighting, sending in attack helicopters to offer air support for the ground forces.

The plan had been to bolster numbers by flying in airborne troops on huge Ilyushin IL-76 transporters before making a direct attack on Kyiv’s seat of power, capturing President Volodymyr Zelensky, overthrowing his government and putting in its place a puppet regime.

But the battle for Hostomel was lost by Russia and Ukraine retains control. At least one IL-76 plane, thought to be carrying about 100 Russian special forces troops, was shot down before it could land. Satellite images that emerged on Monday showed damage to the airfield with what appeared to be large craters in the runway that will prevent Russia from using it, even if it managed to wrestle it back from Ukraine in the coming, critical few days.

With Hostomel off limits, Russian convoys remain easy targets on the road to Kyiv. Along the route, Ukraine troops have launched ambushes and civilians have put in place blockades to slow the advance.

One video posted on Monday showed three middle-aged Ukrainian civilians building a makeshift military barricade, piling hundreds of rubber tyres and sandbags as well as metal barricades 10ft high while about a quarter of a mile away a Russian convoy has halted on a bridge. Spikes were scattered to frustrate troop-carrying trucks and fuel tankers. The makeshift barricade was enough to make the Russian commander order a halt.

The “neutralisation” of Russian “saboteurs” inside Kyiv shows the difficulties facing the Kremlin even if its forces infiltrate the city. Archbishop Evstratiy Zorya, of the Orthodox Church, issued a statement thanking the guards “for their vigilance” and accused Moscow of targeting the head of the church, Primate Epiphanius Dumenko.

“It is well known that in his speech before the start of the war, Putin had complained about the existence of a church independent of Russia in Ukraine. We also know from international partners that the occupier had compiled lists of targets of their terror, including leaders of Ukrainian society and the state.

“These public reports, as well as information that cannot be made public now gave grounds to objectively believe that the Primate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine is among the targets of Russian terror. Given this, special security measures were taken to prevent irreparable consequences for the local church and Ukraine at this time of struggle for freedom.”

Ukraine authorities said there remained a “systematic struggle against a small number of sabotage-reconnaissance groups numbering three to 15 people with weapons”. They wore the uniform of the Ukrainian army but beneath they sported “bulletproof vests of the Russian Federation”.

In briefings by the Ukrainian government, officials said the military had “deployed a dense and multilevel system of defence of the capital”, including using tanks and artillery. The Ukraine air force continued to operate along with drones that the Russian bombardment had failed to knock out, depriving Moscow’s forces of air superiority.

The stalled convoy consists of a number of battalion tactical groups – transporting about several thousand soldiers as well as hardware – and was first picked up on satellite by a US tech firm. When it was spotted on Sunday, it was about three-and-a half miles long, but now with gaps, it stretched to at least 17 miles.

The line of vehicles is so long the satellite could not capture it in one image. In some places, the carriers and trucks were two to three rows deep. These are the troops Russia’s military command will hope can join the fight for Kyiv, possibly encircling the city and laying siege to it.

Philip Ingram, a retired colonel in military intelligence, believes it is highly vulnerable to attack. Ukraine’s ability to pick off at least elements of the convoy may likely decide the outcome of Russia’s war with Ukraine.

“It is a military disaster to have a convoy that length stuck on the road in the middle of a conflict zone where you don’t have air superiority. It is a sitting duck,” said Mr Ingram. “The presence of this convoy has been so well broadcast across open-sourced sites that Ukrainians will know where it is and will give it as much action as possible to halt it. It is a free hit for the Ukrainians. The Russians should not have allowed a convoy that big to develop.” In Kyiv last night, the civilian population remained prepared for battle.

Standing over a trench, a young Ukrainian filmmaker armed with a rifle and kept guard while his friends prepared Molotov cocktails. Three volunteer fighters, dressed in olive fatigues, worked up a sweat a few steps away, positioning a piece of artillery on to a patch of grass separating two lanes of a big city road.

Electronic billboards around them flashed messages warning invading Russian soldiers that “instead of flowers, you will be greeted with bullets”.

Andriy Ivanyuk, a filmmaker, was defiant. “The Russians know very well that our land is burning under their feet,” Mr Ivanyuk told the AFP news agency.

After a 36-hour curfew, Ukraine’s residents came out to make their preparations for the defence of the city. Viktor Rudnichenko, a bank employee, said: “We will greet them with Molotov cocktails and bullets to the head, that’s how we will greet them. The only flowers they might get from us will be for their grave.”

Tens of thousands of Kyiv residents, mainly women and children, had fled the capital but those that remained out of the three million population queued on Monday for bread, water and other supplies. Checkpoints were fortified with furniture, rubber tyres and anything else that could be used to form a barrier. Passers-by were told not to walk on the grass for fear of stepping on landmines planted, it was claimed, in the night by Russian infiltrators.",False,1646090205.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyubmjd,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector [houses] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.”

British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.

In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”

Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.

If we keep stretching this analogy out, Poland might get the dubious honour of being the country invaded to kick off a world war twice if everything goes horribly wrong.

The thing that worries me is the reaction towards Ukraine has been very similar to the reaction towards Czechoslovakia's invasion- support for the victims but nothing really more than that.

006721724442a5a190fef554e4e9229d,t3rvl4,hyuhrsk,"LONDON/WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A cyberattack on a NATO member state could trigger Article 5, its collective defence clause, a NATO official said on Monday, amid concerns that chaos in cyberspace around Russia's invasion of Ukraine could spill over into other territories.  
  
The military alliance has for years made clear that a serious cyberattack could trigger the clause, but such a scenario has so far been largely hypothetical.  
  
""Allies also recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as an armed attack,"" the official told Reuters.  
  
""We will not speculate on how serious a cyberattack would have to be in order to trigger a collective response. Any response could include diplomatic and economic sanctions, cyber measures, or even conventional forces, depending on the nature of the attack,"" the official said.  
  
Whether or not a cyberattack met the threshold of an attack large enough to trigger Article 5 was a ""political decision for NATO Allies to make,"" they added.  
  
Britain and the United States have warned of potential cyberattacks on Ukraine which could have international consequences should, for example, malicious software designed to target networks in Ukraine start to spread elsewhere. read more  
  
There has also been concern among cybersecurity experts that Russia could team up with some of the gangs and people who release malicious software, such as malware used to hold Colonial Pipeline to ransom in the United States last year.  
  
U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner said there were no clear guidelines on how NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) should respond, should such an attack take place.  
  
""These are things that have been in hypothetical discussion for a decade, but because we've not come to any universal conclusion on what those standards should be, what level of attribution is needed, we're kind of in a very grey area,"" he told Reuters.  
  
He posed the hypothetical case of a Russian cyberattack on Ukraine that impacts NATO member Poland, triggering power outages that result in hospital patients dying or knocking out traffic lights, causing fatal road accidents involving U.S. troops deployed there.  
  
""The West may have wanted strategic ambiguity in this area, and that may still be the right choice,"" he added.  
  
""But have we sufficiently made clear to the Russians the red lines on cyber or frankly to the NATO public, the American public, on red lines on cyber? I don't think we've done that.""

NATO didn't conquer land. It didn't send tanks into Warsaw or Vilnius and force their governments at gunpoint to join NATO.

The forces behind NATO expansion are the same behind the war in Ukraine. In Europe lies a future of prosperity: economic development and political freedom. In Moscow, there is only subservience to the Russian elite and the needs of their economy. Is it any wonder why the former Eastern Bloc would gravitate to the West?

A free and peaceful Russia could easily partake in that bounty too, but instead they ha e choosen to draw another iron curtain across the continent. Russia's industry, culture, and resources would make them a power to be respected if they choose integration. But Putin instead chooses empire.

It is the brutal and retrograde nature of Russian governance that led the Baltics, Poland, Hungary, and Former Checkoslovakia to depart the Russian sphere. Ukraine is only the most recent country in Russia's traditional reach to decide that taking orders from Moscow is a path that leads to poverty and death. The people of Belarus and Kazakhstan would say the same if they were allowed to speak.

NATO expanded and should not apologize. The only mistake NATO made was the promise to Yeltsin that they wouldn't expand, which should have never been made. But seeing the bloodthirsty Russian War machine scrap over the remnants of their empire through force of arms, to me, it just emphasizes how justified the people of the former Warsaw Pact were in seeking refuge under the NATO umbrella. Had they not and left the line of demarcation further west, there would be a war of conquest in Poland or the Baltics right now, and Russia trolls would be justifying it on the backs of whatever historical claim supposedly makes their neighbors a subservient client people.

The Russian government believes they have dominion over the free people of Eastern Europe.

Protocol III on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons prohibits, in all circumstances, making the civilian population as such, individual civilians or civilian objects, the object of attack by any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat or a combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target. The protocol also prohibits the use of air-delivered incendiary weapons against military targets within a concentration of civilians, and limits the use of incendiary weapons delivered by other means. Forest and other plants may not be a target unless they are used to conceal combatants or other military objectives.[2][9] Protocol III lists certain munition types like smoke shells which only have a secondary or additional incendiary effect; these munition types are not considered to be incendiary weapons.",1646091504.0,1646091012.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyudyb7,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively

the CCW, is a cornerstone in the regulation of conventional weapons. It
governs weapons which may have indiscriminate effects or cause
unnecessary injury. In an attempt to limit the suffering of both civilians
and combatants in armed conflict, it prohibits certain types of weapons
while strictly regulating others. It, therefore, provides commanders and
staff with very useful and clear guidelines.
The Conventional Weapons Convention is sometimes referred to as a
framework onto which individual protocols on specific weapons can be
added as and when required. Remember, we said the law was dynamic.

If you cough up 1 ether worth $800 for rent because you need a place to live, you're screwing yourself out of the $2400 that 1 ether would be worth in 6 month's time.

A No Fly Zone is an area where no party, except the enforcing party, is allowed to operate aerial platforms, whether fighters, bombers, drones etc.

Now, a stern warning isn't going to do it, so you need to be prepared to *enforce* the NFZ. That means you need to be willing to shoot down violating aircraft, otherwise, what's the point of the NFZ?

So that means you need to have your fighters or air defence systems set up to take down, in this case, Russian aircraft. 

The Russians won't agree to a NFZ obviously. In addition, Russia has plenty of anti air assets, including S400 missile systems that have tremendous range. 

So if you send your fighters into Ukraine, Russia will either take shots at them with their AA net, or they will engage in fights with Russian fighters. 

That means *you* need to take out their AA net and maybe even their fighters first, or in retaliation for when Russia shoots first.

How well do you think Russia will react to the sudden bombing of their AA network and nearby airbases? Or to their planes being shot at by NATO?

They will respond. They will almost certainly target NATO allies in the Baltics, Poland and maybe Romania. Ground incursions from Russia and Belarus are almost certainly guaranteed, even if only temporary. 

All of a sudden you have what NATO was designed to prevent, a European land war with Russia. 

These things can escalate, because almost assuredly, NATO will prevail, even if at great cost. (Yes Russia is still a threat even despite everything going on in Ukraine) Russian doctrine in the event they are losing a conventional war with NATO is to use nukes.

So that's why a NFZ is a spectacularly bad idea. It will either be toothless or it'll invite catastrophic risk of escalation.",False,1646088893.0,t3_t3rvl4,t1_hyu7sfv,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Prolonging the Vietnam War and expanding it just cost more american money and lives. Leading to Cambodia and Laos also turning communist, which they might or might not have without it but turning the population against the US through his actions sure made it easier. 

Pakistan lost the Civil War, Bangladesh became independent all countries on the Indian Subcontinent really played the US and SU against each other to where they could get more out of so that seemed also rather unnecessary.
