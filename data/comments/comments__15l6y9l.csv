1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,15l6y9l,jv9lcpw,"Grandma Hanna, age 97, survivor of the Holodomor famine, a veteran of WW2:

Back during the WW2 days, after one brother was MIA and the other had also been sent off, she, too, wanted to join up:

> Hanna couldn’t stand idle when vehicles drove through her village to gather anyone willing to fight, so she volunteered to defend Ukraine from fascism. All the children were given uniforms, all supplies, guns and even once they were shown how to shoot. Then she had to learn everything [skills] herself.

> She remembers that they first defended the Dnipro, then she went together as they advanced further and further, until they reached Berlin. She will never forget the day when the victory was announced.

> During the war, she did everything [type of work], she did not avoid any task, mostly she had to help the wounded—after a battle, she retrieved them and took them to a safe place, where she then provided medical assistance. Yes, she herself received several injuries, once a shrapnel hit her back, which made it difficult to walk. She even remembers her commanders from then. Next, she points to her hands, which seem to still hurt from constantly washing the [commander’s] uniform.

After the war, she learned her mother hadn’t survived, she married, they worked on a “collective farm” [soviet/communism thing forced upon ukraine], lived [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Novonatalivka,+Kherson+Oblast,+Ukraine,+75222/@46.6155718,33.6084349,10.11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x40c3b793078fa269:0x28167111e95aecf2!8m2!3d46.5149877!4d33.6774477!16s%2Fg%2F121g7s9z?hl=en-us&entry=ttu) and had four children.  Her eldest moved back to the area to care for her.  He had stocked up on supplies and they all lived in her house’s basement until September. They stayed primarily, they say, because the Russians cut off the road north, to Kakhovka. Hiding because the few times someone tried to go out, they’d witness civilians shot. They hid in a basement in Kherson for 6 months

She needed medicine and they learned she’d have to accept Russian passport to get medicine or a pension. At that point, they all decided to leave. She and her family didn’t have to pass thru Russia.  She and 30 of her kids/grandkids/great grandkids got a bus, and camped out near Vasylivka for over a month before Russia let them thru the mostly-closed crossing, manned on both sides by border guards.

(Not going to lie, her wearing her Soviet medals could’ve helped—which she must’ve brought bc she’s wearing them in photos at link below.  But also, that location was staffed by rotating units of LNR boys who’d get rather lax towards the end of a rotation, so this might’ve gotten lucky one day. Also, speaking Surzhyk makes LNR boys more likely to cooperate w requests, some Kherson residents have said, and it is indeed spoken by the rural farmers in Kherson. But also, her age and lack of heart meds availability could also contribute.)

They have all settled far away, near Zaluzhny’s [hometown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zviahel#Name), coincidentally.

She very much wants to fight the Russians, she says she promised as much to the Ukrainian soldiers before the war:

> ""And I answered them: 'Boys, I'll go [along with you as you fight and defend] I'll definitely go, even if I can only peel potatoes, I'll go.' And what now? I've been to Berlin, I'll also go to Moscow, but I'll wait for Victory,"" the woman says.

She says she’s been very welcomed.  But still, she wants to go home. 

> They sincerely believe that they will return home after all, even though there is nothing left—the Russians stole window panes, tore out the doors, took the children's toys—everything was gone, stolen. But everything will be rebuilt, and Kherson Oblast will become the same as before: it will be Ukrainian, rich in harvests, warm and friendly.

> ""It's better on a pile of ashes, but at home. There is nothing more familiar than the native land. I believe that I will see my native home again,"" assures Grandma Hanna.

Editor adds:

> *One thing can be said for sure: they are strong, like all of Ukraine, because after seeing a ruthless enemy, having experienced so much grief, they still know how to smile and wait for Victory. This grandmother is an example for all of us. An example of indomitability and love for life, because her life was very difficult, but she sees only good in it. And it always wins.*

Kozachi Laheri is the soft underbelly of the Russian defenses. There are no fortifications or dragon's teeth. The line does not extend to the area because Russians assumed the Dnieper will protect them; however they blew up the dam and removed the natural obstacle. The village opens up straight to E58, an important supply road. Past that there are huge flat undefended areas, and hundreds of miles of roads to Crimea with an occasional checkpoint. 

Interestingly enough there's been a hard UA blackout on any news from the area. Satellite companies were asked to stop taking or publishing photos of the region weeks ago. Some journalists [post cryptic hints](https://twitter.com/CalibreObscura/status/1688843635037548544) about something huge happening there as we speak.  

Russian sources [state](https://twitter.com/GirkinGirkin/status/1688848913174851587/photo/1) that Kozachi Laheri was held by a poorly trained mobilized regiment after a ""more experienced"" VDV unit was rotated. 

Less official Russian sources state

> The enemy is successfully holding our bank of the Dniepr, and has already taken Kozachi Laheri and even broke through our first line of defenses in the area. The area is mostly held by the mobilized. The enemy has advanced by at least 800 m today. 

While official official Z sources of course state that

> The attempt to land at Kozachi Laheri has been stopped. The left bank is securely held by Russian troops. Anyone who attempts another attack will be eliminated. 

Both [fire detection and satellite images](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1688933342979248129) show something relatively major going on in the area supposedly taken from the Russians.

[Edit] According to the [Bild journalist Julian Röpke](https://twitter.com/JulianRoepcke/status/1688829799861526528)

\-------------------

On those Russian losses:

Mediazona \[independent Russian media outlet\] and BBC News Russian, in collaboration with a team of volunteers, continue counting confirmed Russian losses. We believe that it would not be entirely accurate to refer to it solely as the count of killed Russian servicemen, as it includes, among other, convicts, for whom the wounded-to-killed ratio is very different. It would be more correct to call this count the overall human losses of the Russian side. It is worth noting that it does not include killed volunteer fighters from the “LPR” and ”DPR” as there is almost no information available on them. As of Aug. 3, the reported death toll is 29,217. Subtracting 2.5 thousand Wagner Group mercenaries and tentative 4 thousand Wagner convicts (we believe that only a fraction of 5.5 killed convicts were associated with the Storm-Z units of the Russian MoD), we get 22 thousand killed servicemen confirmed by obituaries. Using our methodology, which we explained earlier, we get up to 60 thousand killed and 180 thousand wounded Russian servicemen.  
The Chief of Staff of the Wagner Group with the call sign Marx has claimed that 78,000 mercenaries participated in the current invasion, with 49,000 of them being former convicts. As of the seizure of Bakhmut on May 20, 22,000 mercenaries were killed and 40,000 were wounded, resulting in an approximate wounded-to-killed ratio of 2:1.  
Russian losses in total:  
Killed: Roughly 60,000 soldiers + 22,000 Wagner Group members = 80,000 people.  
Wounded: About 180,000 soldiers + 40,000 Wagner Group members = 220,000 people.  
Therefore, the cumulative tally of killed and wounded on the Russian side, which can be designated as the total losses, exceeds 300,000 people at the moment. It's worth noting that those repeatedly wounded might be counted several times in this calculation.",False,1691520010.0,t3_15l6y9l,t3_15l6y9l,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

Sigint suggests that Ukrainian Special Forces launched a probing attack on Kozachi Laheri in Kherson oblast.

A Major Tomov was first mentioned by a well-known Z blogger Guzenko / Trinadzaty:

> Especially for smartasses, a recon unit led by Major Tomov is MIA right here (map of Kozachi Laheri )
> 
> If Tomov gets back in contact I'll apologize, wish him all the best, and owe him a bottle of expensive cognac. 
>
> But the group never arrived at their destination. As of right now, not a single one of the 16 men in the unit can be contacted.

Major Tomov was identified as the commander of 1822 battalion, a mobilized unit from Samara. 1822 was in the news just yesterday when a mobilized soldier posted a teary video complaining about being robbed by 247th VDV personnel. 

Now, amazingly, within hours of Guzenko's public tantrum, other Z channels began to publicize a video showing a man who introduces himself as Major Tomov interrogate three supposed Ukrainian POWs. The first time the video was posted, Z bloggers accompanied it with an inredible description:

> On behalf of the fighters of the 1822 battalion, strange footage was sent to us with supposedly captured Ukrainian special forces.
Major Tomov the battalion commander of 1822 is in the video. He himself has been missing since the morning. Some of his fighters suspect that the battalion commander himself is in captivity. The situation is unclear, we continue to try to understand.

Guzenko made a follow-up video in which he made some wild claims: that Tomov is still not in contact with anyone Z-side, and that it's unbelievable that a recon major would choose to release his first ever video the day he goes missing, and show his face and name to boot. He suggests that Tomov made the video under duress after capture, or immediately before capture, with the video getting released by the Ukrainians one way or another. 

> Fuck, of course, I do believe in miracles, but, first of all, I'm recon. It's a trap. And we already confirmed that the Ukrainians have his radio. I know these situations firsthand. Once, they managed to ambush an entire BTG and destroy almost eighty of our soldiers. This is the only explanation. And the video is of course from the commander's cell phone.

Well, turns out we were right - the GOP has turned on Ukraine and a majority of Republicans are supporting Putin's position by wanting to withhold weapon shipments to Ukraine.

**If you're a sane Republican who does not want a future filled with Russian aggression and Russian wars - please do everything you can to talk to your friends and family, remind them of what is at stake, and call/write your representatives to remind them of your stance.**

Fortunately, Biden and the Democrats remain strongly in support of Ukrainian assistance so for the time being we should be able to continue our support.

In this war, both sides have to shoot-and-scoot, right? Both sides have sophisticated artillery tracking systems. Whether you are “on defense” or “on offense”, you get to take a few shots, and then you have to move. There is no “digging in for the long-haul” for the artillery and other medium-range weapons.

To me they should double down on the attritional strategy.  Better to retake mainland Ukraine next year with X deaths than this year with 5X deaths.  What is currently happening is a sort of hybrid with some political pressure to advance but often leading to attempts to do so that end up with many deaths.  For *any* democracy, the lives of its people are the most valuable resource.

If you look back on predictions for the counteroffensive just three months ago, this thread was absolutely choked full of unrealistic high school-quality fantasizing about Ukrainian Leopards curb-stomping Russia to the Sea of Azov in a matter of weeks. There were nonstop comparisons to Desert Storm tank battles and confidently misinformed assurances that Western superior tank design would mean that densely packed Russian minefields and artillery batteries will count for nothing.

This is the reality of the situation now. Ukraine doesn't have air superiority, will not have air superiority in the next two years, and is barely hanging on in the artillery side because of a severe shortfall of Western artillery shell stocks. If Ukraine cannot break through and crush the Russian southern front by this fall, it is highly likely that both sides will be locked in a perpetual static trench war for at least the next year. That's hundreds of Ukrainian people losing their lives and a thousand more getting maimed, every day, for the next year minimum. They do not have the demographics to sustain these attritional losses for years to come. Much of their able-bodied manpower pool (millions of young men and women) fled the war, and they were already experiencing a crisis of aging population before the war. Their agrarian economy has been destroyed, and no businesses except military businesses are opening. They are spending literally half their budget on war. This is a disaster, and it gets worse every day they are unable to shove Russia out of their country.

Russia wants to capitalize on all of this. They are completely fucked too, for similar reasons and some worse reasons, but they have deeper stocks, a potential material support partner in China, and much deeper manpower reserves. They want to drag this into 2025, exhaust Western political support, and tap Ukraine's dwindling population of young males until it is dry.

""I remember after the first two weeks of this war there were rumors""

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I'm making something up that's meant to sound somewhat plausible but isn't really based in anything factual. I still haven't provided any sources that this rumor ever actually existed or came from any credible source. 

""that one of the possibilities US intelligence was briefing people""

This is the appeal to an accepted credible authority. Who may or may not have ever said anything of the sort, but it sounds official if its proposed to be coming from US Intel, right?  And its just one of the possibilities, so there's all kinds of wiggle room for deniability and vagueness built in. 

""on was a 30 year long grinding war with Russia eventually losing.""

The real point and the scare tactic here is the 30 year grinding war idea. Supposedly proposed, you know as one option of many, so you know it could or could not be valid, if it was even ever said by US Intel in the first place.  The Russia loses at the end part is to make the rumor seem even more realistic and palatable and credible. You're supposed to think Oh God maybe this is going to last 30 years?? Even if Russia loses eventually that's just not worth it amirite? Remember folks, this is all a made up story. 

""Seems like a real possibility at this point,""

Here's the hook. OP implies well you know I actually believe it, so maybe you should too!  Could be a real possibility!  OhMyGod what if it's true?? You are meant to ask yourself this. Based on nothing more than a made up story implying a poor future of suffering. To get you to withdraw continuing support for UA. 

""especially because it's not even clear that Putin's death will end the war.""

Another wishy washy claim meant to sow doubt in your mind. I mean OP did say its not clear, so maybe it would but maybe it wouldn't amirite? Also it seems obvious Putin won't last in power another 30 years so this conveniently plants the unsubstantiated idea that his removal won't change a thing. This noncommittal and intentionally impossible to disprove statement is intended to make you picture the worst case scenario... and then convince yourself that its likely. Don't fall for it. And don't argue against it, that's just arguing silly irrelevant hypotheticals based on nothingness but make believe. 

""Fucked up reality we are living in. Tons of people dead, wounded, displaced over some make believe justification for imperialism in fucking 2023.""

Ahh the closing. Reinforcing the terrible reality we are all subjected to, the current horror. Again, despite the obvious dig at Russia's imperialism to provide the cover of supporting Ukraine, the key message in this closing is to get you to picture a 30 year war filled with continuous horrors that even Putin's removal can't derail. The intent is to get you so Concerned with the possibility that you just want the war to stop as soon as possible to avoid seemingly needless suffering for a very long time with no resolution or change in the status quo. And therefore to try to convince you to call for an end to war now and to stop supporting Ukraine. 

Now that we have left the land of make believe, you can click your heels 3 times and say ""this is all made up, there's no facts to support it, someone is trying to manipulate me.""",False,1691481416.0,t3_15l6y9l,t1_jv9lp9b,,1,22,0,22,0,0,

Even if that were to flip, the GOP politicians themselves are more concerned with defense lobbyists and what not and they would not start losing primaries over Ukraine unless it went to something like 75/25 against, which is a long ways away if ever.

Of the 60% that support Ukraine from my experience on various forums and talking to a lot of people it's more or less the same moral decision that the cold war was for them. Russia is the bad guy, still doing bad things, and we should support their victims. Of the 40% opposed it's basically the type that read zero hedge and other fringe news sources, where you can see a direct line from Kremlin talking points (""fight to the last Ukrainian"", blaming Ukraine for continuing to fight while trying to position capitulation as pro peace, ""all this money wasted while we have our own problems at home"", ""Russia is defending itself after the US backed coup installed its puppet"", ""were all gonna die in ww3 if Ukraine doesn't surrender"") and on and on. 

From what I've seen there is no real GOP opposition that is not a result of successful Russian propaganda. And the sad part is again from what I've observed in conversations they don't even know it. By the time the propaganda is filtered down to their preferred news sources there are no Russian links apparent, and the only people telling them otherwise are those that they already do not trust in the ""mainstream"" media (and certainly to be fair, distrust of the corporate western media is far far from unjustified, so its an all around shitty situation).

So to answer your question it's a cause for concern if this war drags out for 2,3,4 years. But at least until the election nothing will change.

Actually I'm understating it. The meme-depth figure that people cite here is that Ukraine has 700,000 members in their Armed Forces. That figure is from Spring 2022, and it does not account for (1) that most of those troops are not combat troops, (2) losses sustained since Spring 2022, or (3) the average age of new volunteers and conscripts.

By Ukraine's own MoD figures, they have been losing approximately 500 to 1,000 people just from battlefield wounds almost every day for the last 18 months. America's leaked estimates in February 2022, which have yet to be contradicted by any publicly available information in the last 6 months, are that Ukraine was at about 100,000 battlefield casualties (wounded + dead totals). That was six months ago -- six months of relatively intense fighting since. 

Ukraine continues to take volunteers and conscripts, but their capacity to train new fighters is bottlenecked. Michael Kofman and other Western military observers noted as far back as January that Ukraine's training and replacement manpower intake is severely capped, primarily due to the loss of almost all of the most experienced fighters in the first year of the war. NATO countries have stepped up, but they do *not* train as many replacement soldiers per month as Russia does. Obviously the training is better in the West, but it is still highly rushed training. Ukraine elite 10th Corps of 40,000 men that was formed for the counteroffensive this spring got scarcely more than 2 months of actual training. (And remember that a lot of those new trainees are middle aged men.)

I have not seen any figures from any source about the average source of the age of Ukrainian volunteers or conscripts. If you have some, I will read. All I'm aware of are just anecdotal reports, which paint a murky picture. At this point, there are hundreds of videos from the front, and the age of Ukrainian soldiers does not look great. Older men in their 40s and sometimes even their 50s are visible in both their regular Territorial Defense Force units, as well as their most elite armored offensive units. This is a sign of objective difficulties in manning units to the quality the AFU desires. Many of the men in their units are in age brackets of increased risk of heart attacks from extreme physical workouts.

>France had a similar population to Ukraine in WW2 and suffered over a million casualties and still fought on.

Ukraine has a significantly worse age crisis than France did in 1914. It's not comparable.

>Only about 6 million people have left Ukraine so far, most of them women and children

No, it's around 10 million, approximately 25% of Ukraine's population, and a large number of them are young men and women.

>China will never directly support Russia

They have donated millions of pieces of non-lethal equipment to Russia already. If the West continues to give more and more direct lethal aid, China very well may decide to start trickling in some of its own to test the waters. Depending on the West's response, it may decide to give more and increasingly push the boundary. China is motivated to drag this conflict out because it is sapping Western resources.

>This war will go on for years, and Ukraine still has time to turn it around.

Because we can't. Air superiority is not possible without the F-35 or B-2, and those simply will not, under any circumstances, go to a non-NATO / Israel / Pacific China-containment partner.

The problem is that if we give Ukraine F-35s, some of them will be shot down, lots of them will be observed in combat and studied in the air, and some of them will be recovered from crash sites by Russia and disassembled in China. It is simply not a risk that Western planners will take. Stealth air supremacy doctrine and technology is the West's #1 ace in the hole against Russia and China.

bdbf9ff3208b15ab59c13396bf0782ef,15l6y9l,jvayq7x,"I can see a couple of problems with your idea:

\* Locomotion -  You haven't made it entirely clear how these huge sphere's would move across the battlefield. Were they to be used in massive numbers and be shifted purely by the explosive forces of the mines they triggered, they would sooner or later end up disabled inside craters of their own making from which they couldn't free themselves. Alternatively, were the vehicle to have internal locomotion, it would require a friction surface that connected to the ground that would compromise its armour and would effectively be a very fat tank . Any kind of weighted offset approach that shifted weight within the sphere in the direction of travel would necessarily position the working parts over the mine it was about to trigger. Furthermore, the purpose of any mine-clearing vehicle is to create a defined path through which heavy armour and subsequent troop-carrying and support vehicles can travel. Such a 'Brownian motion' approach to vehicle guidance would not create a route that could be traversed with confidence and this is critical at speed and under fire, as any such vehicles would certainly be.

  
\*Shape and protection - you mention that a large spherical shape dimpled like a golf ball would in some way deflect the blast from a mine designed to penetrate armour. This isn't the case. Early tanks did have rounded outlines and turrets, but such surfaces cannot deal with munitions that gain their efficacy through focus and high temperature. Modern mines contain penetrating charges that expel metalic plasma several feet in a few milliseconds. The only way to beat this is with a flat surface that deflects the charge in a given direction, hence the angular shapes of modern tanks. 

Honestly there are loads more issues too. That said, there used to be and maybe still is a type of anti-armour mine that looked like a Zorb ball with an anti-tank charge inside it. Frontline infantry could run up to them and punt them out of the way as their triggers were magnetic. They had about a 2% kill rate, even without infantry kicking them around.",False,1691505170.0,t3_15l6y9l,t1_jvalusg,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

I also have experience as crew on a couple of different armoured vehicle models. It's blindingly obvious that you don't, and that you have no real idea what you're talking about.

You're saying large diameter sphere, how large exactly? Because the larger it is, the closer to flat and level it will seem from the perspective of an anti tank mine. Flat and level is the exact opposite of what you want for deflecting a blast.

High explosives dgaf, they'll chew off bits and make cracks in your sphere no matter what it's made of. And no, you can't just weld on more plating and continue if you want it to last; armour works by being hard, and welding messes up the heat treatment so it either goes soft or develops brittleness with microcracks. I know the Ukrainians are doing improvised armour repairs because they have little choice, but we shouldn't mistake re-welded armour for good armour unless they really really know what they're doing and heat treat the entire hull after welding on it.

 Damage from repeated explosions is one of the problems with mine rollers, they work well until a roller gets too badly damaged. But then that roller can be easily replaced, for while it uses effectively the same approach of ""massive and heavy"" as your sphere, the rollers themselves are just dumb solid wheels made out of steel with or without concrete in the middle. They have no mechanism inside to get broken, and are cheap, unlike your fancy sphere. Mine flails, likewise, are designed such that the bits getting blown off are cheap and easy to replace in the field. 

I still have trouble seeing how you're going to move that sphere around. In order to not get stopped by small bumps and soft ground, it will need to have quite a large diameter (like how skateboard wheels are not suitable on gravel but larger bicycle wheels are). At a bare minimum, if it isn't pushed around by a tank-like vehicle just like a mine roller, it will need to be the size of a large truck tire. Probably larger still. And the larger it is, the heavier it needs to be in order to have sufficient ground pressure to set off all mines. It also needs space for your propulsion system; you can't rely on constantly hitting mines and being bounced around, that's just silly. I'm thinking your device has to weigh almost as much as a tank and be a couple of meters across, maybe more. And then it will be unable to clear down in narrow ditches or small depressions in the ground, due to its large diameter not fitting down in there..

What you describe here is so far outside what the laws of physics permit, I have to assume you're either a child or a troll.

Your sphere itself takes direct hits. And it will get cracked open by those blasts, eventually. Nothing can take repeated explosions at that scale without at least developing material fatigue after a while, and on top of that you're having bits eroded away from the surface each time.

You don't seem to comprehend how fast high explosive detonations are, by definition they're supersonic.

You cannot ""detect an explosion"" and then release pressurised gas to counteract, the explosion is over before your valve has time to open.
