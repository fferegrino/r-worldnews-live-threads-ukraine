Kyiv has long pushed for heavier weaponry but Western nations have been fearful of becoming drawn into the war or provoking Russia.

""The recent pledges for heavy warfare equipment are important - and I expect more in the near future,"" said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday.

Day 325-326 of my updates from Kharkiv.

These past 2 days were just horrible, as they usually are after a new missile strike happens. Here in Kharkiv the situation is stable right now. Yesterday we lost electricity around 3:40pm, but it was restored pretty fast, some places already had it back up after a couple of hours, for us specifically it took until 11pm, which is still very fast. By this morning the electricity was already restored everywhere in Kharkiv oblast, but there is still a big energy generation deficit in the system because Russians managed to hit 2 of our thermal power plants, so some cities will have longer blackouts for some time until those are fixed/rerouted.

While the electricity problems do suck, the missile strikes on civilians yesterday are much worse, and they hurt much more than sitting without electricity for a couple of hours. It’s not something that would ever break our spirit or make us surrender, but seeing innocent civilians killed by the fucking Russian terrorists is just enraging. 

And Russians were extremely happy when the news about apartment block in Dnipro being hit were released, they want more of it. It disgusts me that so many people defend Russians, saying they are “innocent”, while those “innocent Russians” gloat about our civilians being killed by missiles every single time it happens. How the fuck can you be happy about our civilians being killed and innocent at the same time? I’ll never be able to understand that.

To towed and self-propelled artillery systems, drones, advanced anti-air system complexes and batteries, long range MLRS systems, IFVs and AFVs, mortar systems, radar system including country battery capabilities, HMMWVs, ambulances, Soviet based tanks and helicopters, parts for Soviet and Russian based jet systems, maintenance and repair stations for all of the above in friendly NATO countries. 


Now we get to check off Western main battle tanks as well.

Outside of increased volumes of all the aforementioned things. Conventionally all the lines left to cross are Western helicopters, jets, and long range armaments.


Meanwhile Russia continues to use up all is equipment and supplies and struggles to get their supply chain up to speed. Europe is completely or almost completely off of Russian gas, it's oil is forced to sell at heavy discount to India and China, it's super toned down the nuclear rhetoric, and lost 40% of all the territory it initially took. Men have fled in the hundreds of thousands from the Russian mobilization and conscription, and along with them many educated people. They've almost certainly experienced 100,000+ casualties, dwarfing the Soviet Afghanistan war estimates.

>  
>DNIPRO, Ukraine — Two hours after a Russian missile slammed into a Ukrainian apartment complex on Saturday, shocking the city that has served as a relatively safe haven for the war’s displaced, rescue workers digging through rubble spotted a sudden movement from above.  
>  
>On the eighth floor, they could see the arm of a bloodied elderly woman, so buried in debris she could barely move, waving a piece of red fabric. Below her, dozens of apartments had collapsed, swallowing residents into some 30 feet of rubble.  
>  
>From inside the damaged building, she was somehow alive — and calling for help.  
>  
>Russia’s blatant attack on civilians here — the worst to strike this city since Russia invaded Ukraine last February — came just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed his most senior military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, as the new overseer of his relentless war in Ukraine.  
>  
>The strike, which coincided with the Orthodox New Year, served as a grim message that Putin’s close confidant is likely to continue the violent missile strikes on civilian targets that have become a hallmark of Russia’s assault. The bombing, one of a wave of attacks Saturday across Ukraine, may have destroyed as many as 30 apartments in the sprawling complex, said Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who shared a video of the destruction.  
>  
>Residents were trapped as flames engulfed part of the structure, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, said on Telegram.  
>  
>At least 12 people died in the apartment building Saturday, and at least 73 others were wounded, according to Ukraine’s top military commander. At nightfall, at least 38 people had been rescued, he said. Many more are believed to be buried in the ruins. As the city neared its midnight curfew, dogs wearing specialized shoes to protect them from injuries were scaling the mound of debris, sniffing for survivors. Off to the side, the dead lay on the ground in white bags, red and white tape wrapped around them.  
>  
>The living, hundreds of them, appeared out of the darkness, as they do in so many Ukrainian towns on so many nights, to clean up and hand out food and hot drinks.  
>  
>While Russian missiles struck other Ukrainian cities on Saturday, none caused anything close to the scale of damage in Dnipro. The attack came as an exceptional shock here because it’s been something of a refuge. Many displaced people, from places such as the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol or the front line regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, have relocated here seeking safety and normalcy.  
>  
>“We don’t have any safe spaces in Ukraine anymore,” said Maksym Chornyi, 32, who volunteered to help rescue people at the scene. “It needs to be clear to Europe as well, because these rockets can land there too.”  
>  
>He was at home on the other side of Dnipro on Saturday afternoon when he heard the attack — so powerful it sent a shock wave through much of the city.  
>  
>He rushed to the scene, where he climbed through the wreckage to search for survivors with nothing more than a face mask to protect him from the smoke billowing through the air. After several hours, rescue workers asked him and other volunteers to move back so they could bring heavy machinery into the area to keep digging. He stepped away, his face dark with soot.  
>  
>What he witnessed inside the wreckage was nightmarish.  
>  
>At one point, he heard screaming and thought it was coming from below. Then he realized it was the woman trapped on the eighth floor, who told rescuers her name was Lyuba. Later, he looked up and realized a dead man was hanging off the other side of the building — his intestines ripped out of his body.  
>  
>Just nearby, “there was blood streaked down the wall,” Chornyi said. “I feel horrible.”  
>  
>Just before 8 p.m., rescue workers finally dug Lyuba out of the remains of her home and slowly lowered her to the ground in a yellow stretcher. She lay silently as they wrapped her in a foil blanket.  
>  
>One of the workers who carried her down blew her a kiss and leaned over her. “I promised I was going to save you and I did,” he said. “Everything is going to be okay.”  
>  
>Then they whisked her away in an ambulance.  
>  
>One of the Ukrainian Red Cross medics who helped carry her to safety said she believed both her legs were broken. Her face was covered in blood.  
>  
>When asked what message she would want to send the world after this attack, the medic, who identified herself only as Natalya, 36, didn’t hesitate.  
>  
>“Stop Russia,” she said.  
>  
>Nadya Yaroshenko’s son Rostyslav, who is 12, was home alone in their third-floor apartment when the missile struck. He called his mom in a panic, asking how he could flee, she recalled.  
>  
>“There are no stairs,” he told her. With much of the building destroyed, he crawled toward the elevator and waited for help, she said.  
>  
>Her friends pushed past first responders, screaming that there was a child trapped inside. Then one scaled the building and carried him out through a window, unharmed.  
>  
>Hours later, the family was still waiting for any sign of their missing cat and dog.  
>  
>Then a neighbor, Andriy Filkovich, called with good news. “Nadya, the dog is next to me with her savior. Where are you?” he said.  
>  
>A firefighter handed the shaking dachshund, named Cola, back to Yaroshenko, who wrapped her in her arms. “You were so scared,” she cooed. “Don’t be scared.”  
>  
>Their cat, Bilyash, whose blue and yellow eyes match the Ukrainian flag, was still missing.

After 326 days, Russia still seems to be chasing that “one defining win” that will somehow break the back of Ukraine’s military.

On the same note, the Russian media is still searching for a cleaver change of tactics that will create a path forward for Russia to win.

This kind of propaganda is very engaging and exciting, but it has a time limit. Eventually people become skeptical.

For example, with every change of top Russian generals there were discussions on both sides about how this will effect the progress of the war. The latest shuffling of the deckchairs with putting Gerisamov in charge, has made barely a ripple.

>
>With Western sanctions barring many imports, a lot of what Russia needs now travels a slow, crowded truck route through the Caucasus Mountains from Georgia.
>
>Situated in the Caucasus at the southeastern extreme of Europe, Georgia offers the quickest overland route to Turkey, which has become one of Russia’s main trade links to the West. Over the first six months of 2022, cargo transit between Turkey and Russia tripled in volume and much of it traveled on Georgian roads, according to research conducted by TBC Capital, Georgia’s leading investment bank.
>
>On average, the line of trucks backed up to cross the frontier, snaking through the picturesque slopes in northern Georgia, was more than twice as long in December as it was a year earlier, according to the Russian Federal Customs Service. The traffic is far more than the border checkpoint can handle.
>
>It’s impossible to tell how much of the European cargo crossing Georgia is subject to European Union sanctions. But the country’s emergence as a key link in commerce to Russia highlights a potential loophole in E.U. sanctions policy.
>
>The Georgian government has insisted that it strictly enforces Western sanctions, and that many shipments have been denied. But opponents of the ruling party in Parliament say that goods and money are flowing through largely unhindered.
>
>The economic cooperation with Russia, which gained control of one-fifth of Georgia’s territory after the 2008 war, has infuriated many Georgians.
“Our government chose to be in between,” said Giorgi Oniani, deputy executive director of the Tbilisi chapter of Transparency International, the global anti-corruption group. “But at least personally some of them feel closer to Russia and the Kremlin.”

Interestingly, a statement from 10 DowningStreet says: “UK defence and security officials believe a window has opened up where Russia is on the backfoot due to resupply issues and plummeting morale.”

The statement adds: “The Prime Minister is therefore encouraging allies to deploy their planned support for 2023 as soon as possible to have maximum impact.”

(ie maximum pressure on Germany to release its Leopard tanks.

Recently Rheinmetall said that even if they're approved today, Ukraine will receive them in 2024 at the earliest. But they forgot all the Leopard tanks that other countries have and are willing to send to Ukraine. I read somewhere that the total # of Leopards that could be sent right now is around 100, Ukraine wants 300, but given the right supporting units ie AA, and supporting infantry 100 Leopards is plenty to exploit weak salients. It is more than likely that Ukraine will use them all concentrated as spitting them up into smaller battalions along the front would require a exponentially more complex logistical tail. 

Everyone knows that the next attack is going to take place in Zaporizhzhya > Tokmak > Melitopol to cut the Russian forces in half and starve out Crimea. There will be no element of surprise as the Russians have spent considerable resources fortifying avenues of approach. But if they still have zero answers to HIMARS after all this time, wouldn't all these fortifications mean nothing? And the Ukrainians don't even need to reach the Sea of Azov, they just need to get close enough to cut off the rest of the land bridge with artillery. The only way to supply Crimea would be by ship. If the Ukranians could successfully drive a wedge to Melitopol, and use HIMARS to knock out AA and anti-missile defenses on the near side of Crimea, it would fall on the US to supply Ukraine with the 300km HIMARS munitions and pound all Crimean ports on the south side of the peninsula. How long could Crimea hold out without reliable source of supplies? Ukraine would have to protect the wedge for a month or two with all the AA they could muster. 

The war would be over if Crimea is succesfully starved, Zelensky would call Putin to the table, threaten to take Crimea but if he withdraws all Russian forces from the Donbass and rest of Ukraine, he'll let Putin keep Crimea as a propaganda victory and declare Ukraine a neutral state. Maybe even allow the river to flow to Crimea after a few years if Putin ends his hostile stance towards Ukraine.",False,1673827419.0,t3_10c9ze6,t3_10c9ze6,,0,-29,0,-29,0,0,

Loss of control of its territory, or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force  
Erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions  
Inability to provide public services  
Inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community  


Common characteristics of a failing state include a central government so weak or ineffective that it has an inability to raise taxes or other support and has little practical control over much of its territory and hence there is a non-provision of public services. When this happens, widespread corruption and criminality, the intervention of state and non-state actors, the appearance of refugees and the involuntary movement of populations, sharp economic decline, and military intervention from both within and without the state in question can occur.""

The amount of corruption could be incredible. I really hope Ukrainians could come up with some methods to avoid that. Maybe hiring Western firms to manage rebuilding, introduce harsh punishment (up to death sentence) for corruption, etc. Ukraine will get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become one of the strongest countries in the world. I really hope they will not squander that chance and that the world will steer them in the right direction.
If Zelensky stays, his team will have a lot of corruption as well, don't think he could do anything about that. I think for him it would be best to leave the post after the war ends and then use his political capital to promote Ukraine and fundraise around the world.

Also the AC130 would, I'm pretty sure, be a terrible idea to send into an active warzone against an enemy who has air defence capabilities. The AC130 is gigantic, slow, heavy, and ludicrously expensive, making it an admittedly incredibly devastating weapon in the right situation, but also a fantastically easy and high value target for Anti-Air missiles and enemy interceptor jets.

The AC130 is incredibly effective against a ragtag, disorganised militia armed with AKs and Toyota pickups, who can't shoot back at it with anything actually threatening, and in a war where the enemy hides among civilians, requiring pinpoint accurate bombardment. That's what it was built for, and it is pretty useless outside of that role.

In full scale, roughly equal footing warfare, it wouldn't survive 2 missions. The role of bombardment of enemy positions is handled by the regular, ground-borne artillery instead, and the role of precision strikes is done by helicopter gunships which can pop up from behind a hill, fire and then retreat again before the enemy fires back, and fighter jets that are small and fast enough to deliver the missile and then escape before the enemy can react.",False,1673787134.0,t3_10c9ze6,t1_j4fqd0t,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

The lack of justification and the difficulty Putin would have had in moving that direction for earlier mobilisation has put the Russian military into a terrible position where conscripts were used with zero training and equipment to plug the line, and that will carry forward for months.

The only exceptions were the M777 which was given very early in the war and Germany because they announce some things well ahead of time, and even they were training Ukranian troops on the Pzh 2000 self propelled artillery way before they announced they would be giving it to them.

The best example of this is HIMARS where it was admitted that they were operational two weeks before they were announced they were delivered at the end of June. And they only announced they were giving them to Ukraine at all on June 1st. So did they train Ukrainian soldiers on use and basic repairs, move spare parts and the launchers and ammo to Ukraine all in two weeks? No, they decided to do it months before anything was announced and that's when they started training.

They boil the frog with a constant stream of will we/won't we waffling over new weapon systems to undercut Russia's ability to claim escalation.

Any press conference is an exercise in PR, that's what they're for, they don't necessarily have anything to do with what is actually being done.

he doesn't use such things now because he's bet hedging. they're catastrophic weapons that would put his future in real jeopardy. currently he imagines he can take Crimea and donbas and come out and be a normal world leader again a few years from now. he couldn't do that if he were forced to use those weapons. but guess what? if he starts to lose anyway, and if it becomes apparent to him that he will absolutely not go home with a consolation prize he will likely choose to escalate to those larger bombs. he will risk losing those planes, and risk everything because he'll know he can't survive as president of Russia after losing the war.

From Wikipedia:

Soldiers who are wearing uniforms of the opposing army after the start of combat may be considered illegal combatants and subject to summary execution. Many armies have performed that kind of false flag ruse in the past, including both German and US special forces during World War II. However, if soldiers remove their disguises and put on proper insignia before the start of combat in such an operation, they are considered legal combatants and must be treated as prisoners-of-war if captured. That distinction was settled by a military tribunal in the postwar trial of Otto Skorzeny, who led Operation Greif, an infiltration mission in which German commandos wore US uniforms to infiltrate US lines during the Battle of the Bulge.",False,1673797218.0,t3_10c9ze6,t1_j4gdnpe,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

The change we're seeing now is troops from Kherson being redeployed. Ukraine will match it or start an offensive elsewhere drawing the pressure from Bakhmut.

I’m sure Ukraine will augment that based on their needs so It may end up being less personnel though I can’t imagine by much. Many don’t realize AA batteries aren’t just all-in-one missile trucks and actually have tons of auxiliary vehicles for control and radar.

Edited some words

Found [this](https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/policy/army/fm/3-01-85/appa.htm) because I wanted to make more sense of the diagram in your article. The diagram shows part of a Line Battery: Fire Control Platoon connected to a Launcher Platoon with 4 Launcher Sections with double the Launching Stations for some reason. Also doesn’t include all the Maintenance Platoon and HQ locations so that’s even more that can be added to the list. 

Wonder how they’re going to use this system since they only received a single battery which severely limits the ground it can cover. I’m also curious if Ukraine will adopt the same battalion structure the US has if it receives more systems or if it will use the batteries in a more decentralized way.

That would be incorrect.

What can be debated is wether we should have extended that guarantee to Ukraine before 2014. In my opinion we could not because back then Ukraine was not on a trajectory to join the West, and was lead by a pro-russian patsy. During Maidan Russia beat us to it and acted before a new government was in place and fully in control of the country. After, it would have been a case of us choosing war against Russia again.

The US and NATO are really overwhelming in their capabilities (rough example: a single US Nimitz-class carrier has more strike capability than most nations... and the US Navy operates something like 11 or 12 carriers), so finding proper examples of tank on tank fights involving modern Western armor against Soviet-era stuff in the past 40 years that aren't over before they start are really rare.

Closest useful example I can think of would be the Battle of 73 Easting in the 1991 Gulf War. American armored group came up against Iraqi Republican Guard in prepared positions (during a sandstorm, if I'm not mistaken). The Americans lost one Bradley to enemy action, no Abrams were knocked out, and the entire Iraqi force was destroyed. Apparently the advantage was really in optics and mobility: the Abrams could fire accurately while maneuvering at the same time, and their FLIR sights, in particular, allowed them to effectively dismantle the Iraqi T-72s at will. The T-72s were stuck with optical sights only, and thus had difficult acquiring targets effectively.

The British Challenger II and the German Leopard should be roughly comparable to the Abrams, and the Abrams has been absolutely shitting on the T-72 for over 30 years now. Assuming that the Ukrainians are being trained properly, and can field them with proper support (which they've been doing just fine with their Soviet-era tanks, so there's no reason to believe they wouldn't be able to do the same with Western tanks)... yeah. They're likely to be a massive asset for Ukraine, and an absolute fucking nightmare for the Russians.
