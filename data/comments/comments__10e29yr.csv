In hindsight, it is absolutely ridiculous how Putin got away with using the military-grade nerve agent Novichok in the UK, invading Ukraine's Crimea and Donbas, bombing a munition depot in the Czech Republic, shooting down the MH17 airliner, poisoning and murdering political opponents and dissidents in Russia, etc.",False,1673955711.0,t3_10e29yr,t3_10e29yr,,0,181,0,181,0,0,

Day 327-328 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The past 2 days were somewhat quiet, there were no missile strikes that were aimed at Kharkiv, but Kupiansk was hit with S-300 missiles. They hit an empty college, which is expected, they really love destroying anything to do with education. They were hitting a new school every day in Kharkiv while they were still launching a bunch of S-300 missiles at us, but after they were thrown out from Kupiansk it became their new main target, so now their goal is to destroy every educational facility in Kupiansk.

They are also targeting apartment buildings in Kupiansk, just today 2 people were injured from shelling and many apartment buildings and private houses were damaged. It’s even worse in Kherson right now, the shelling there is getting worse and yesterday it was reported that it was shelled over a hundred times in a day, which is the same intensity we had here in Kharkiv at the start of the war, and it is just horrible. They are pretty much exclusively targeting civilians too, mostly apartment blocks and medical institutions, fucking bastards.

Yesterday around midnight Russians were reporting that their positions in Belgorod were being massively hit by our shelling. They were reporting dozens of explosions, and apparently it was actually pretty effective, because in the morning Russian media reported casualties in their military in Belgorod oblast. They reported just 5 soldier deaths, but seeing that it is being reported at all most likely means that their casualties are much worse, or otherwise they just wouldn’t have said anything about it at all.

>  
>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Alina Kapatsyna often dreams about getting a phone call from her mother. In those visions, her mother tells her that she’s coming home.  
>  
>Men in military uniforms took 45-year-old Vita Hannych away from her house in eastern Ukraine in April. She never returned.  
>  
>Her family later learned that Hannych, who has long suffered from seizures because of a brain cyst, is in custody in the Russian-occupied part of the Donetsk region.  
>  
>Kapatsyna told The Associated Press that it remains unclear why her mother — ”a peaceful, civilian and sick person” who has never held a weapon — was detained.  
>  
>Hannych is one of hundreds — and perhaps thousands — of Ukrainian noncombatants believed to be held by Russian forces for months following their invasion. Some are deemed to be prisoners of war, even though they never took part in the fighting. Others are in a sort of legal limbo — not facing any criminal charges or considered to be POWs.  
>  
>The jail staff told Kapatsyna’s grandmother that Hannych was a sniper, allegations her family deems absurd, given her condition. Medical records seen by the AP confirmed that she had a brain cyst, as well as “residual encephalopathy” and “general convulsive attacks.”  
>  
>Anna Vorosheva, who spent 100 days in the same facility as Hannych, recounted squalid, inhumane conditions: putrid drinking water, no heat or showers, having to sleep in shifts and hearing new prisoners screaming from being beaten.  
>  
>Vorosheva, 46, said she wasn’t told why she was detained, aside from “smirks and jokes about Nazis” — a reference to Russia’s false claims that what it calls its “special military operation” was a campaign to “denazify” Ukraine. She also said the staff told her: “Be happy we’re not beating you.”  
>  
>Donetsk authorities labeled Hannych a POW and recently told the family she is imprisoned in the occupied city of Mariupol. It remains unclear when, if at all, she could be released.  
>  
>Ukraine’s top human rights organization, Center for Civil Liberties, has requests concerning around 900 civilians captured by Russia since the war began, with more than half still in custody.

Instead:
- Gas prices in Europe fell to pre-war levels.

- Europe didn't collapse and freeze.

- Germany got rid of its dependence on Russian gas.

- No mass protests against price increases

Putin, the brilliant strategist.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,10e29yr,j4oq10i,"Do the Russians know about the terrorist attack in Dnipro?  Yes and no.  The Russian media initially reported that “a building in Dnipro partially collapsed, 40+ people killed, 60 adults and 15 children were injured.”  No mention of the CAUSE of the “collapse.”

Then, yesterday, journalist asks Peskov if Russian missile hit building, Peskov responds, “The Russian armed forces do not strike at residential buildings or at social infrastructure facilities. The strikes are carried out on military targets, including both obvious and disguised. You yourself saw the conclusions of some representatives of the Ukrainian side [referring to Arestovych], which said that this tragedy was the result of the action of air defense counter-missiles.” 

Now that Peskov suggested the collapse was air-defense related, the previously-ignorant masses now realize it wasn’t faulty construction but war-related, and most likely, Russian-caused.  And specifically, men who know construction or military, post what had to be the cause. 

*I perused the comment section of a Russian newspaper* [in a “know thy enemy” sense]—*comments are a mix of sarcastic folks who can spot the lies, and some true believers, but almost zero concern for casualties—and I included upvotes and responses*:



_____

- it's not us and we're not there, everything is as usual.  ^(+53, -14)


  - So what? It’s for Donetsk!  ^(+4, -16)

- Ukraine does not yet have air defense systems against X22. And it doesn’t matter how the air defenses worked, the first question is what the rocket of a foreign state was doing on the territory of Ukraine. If there hadn’t been a rocket, it wouldn’t have fallen, regardless of whether or not there is air defense and how “crooked” their eyes and hands are. ^(+44, -10)


  - If there were no fascist Ukraine, then the missiles would not fly.

  - What do Ukrainian rockets do in Donetsk every day? Or were you born yesterday, exactly on the day when Russia ""attacked"" the unfortunate Ukraine? ^(+5, -2)




- We open Wikipedia. We find there: the mass of the warhead for different types of missiles of the S-300 complex is from 24 to 150 kg.
Let's open Wikipedia again. And we look at the X-101 rocket [kh-101 missile]. We find that this rocket has a warhead mass of 400 kg.
You can also look at the topic X22 [kh-22] in the same Wikipedia. In which, in a non-nuclear version, the mass of the warhead is 960 kg.
Now let's go back to the ruined house and look at the photo.
What warhead is needed to cause such destruction?
Here are the answers to the questions... ^(+29, -10)


  - In our country, unfortunately, fewer and fewer people are trying to think. It’s easier to believe the Peskov, Solotov, etc. ^(+21, -4)

     - Peskov, Solovyov are liars—let’s agree; but Aristovich wouldn’t lie—what’s the point—and he said that this was caused by air defense. Lots of video evidence. So thinking and reflecting is not your forte ^(+6, -7)


  - In general, no warhead is needed for walls to crumble, just enough morons with a gas cylinder. It collapsed not because there is a lot of ammunition, but because the house is of such a design. ^(+2, -4)

     - They planted explosives and blew them up to blame us. ^(+0, -2)

  - Your nonsense is a direct descreditation of the Russian military. There is an article for this in the Russian Federation. I will ask authorities to give its opinion on such actions of the site [promoting discreditation by allowing comments]. ^(+1, -6)

- We know how honest this guy [Peskov] is. ^(+40, -4)


- You can approach the issue differently. Without going into details about whose missile, etc. Would anyone's missile fly into a residential building if Russia had not carried out a special operation in Ukraine? ^(+35, -9)

- The building was destroyed by the Russian X22. No anti-missile could have caused such destruction. And missile remnants will find be found. Not immediately, concrete rubble must first be removed. ^(+43, -9)

  - of course they will. just like the production in Bucha, they will bring it from another place and lay it out so that the picture for the Western media is beautiful ^(+10, -14)

     - Like how Auschwitz was brought to Poland in order to discredit the Nazis? ^(+6, -2)



- with the same level of credibility, we can say that the cause was that an air conditioner exploded; it would be better to remain silent than to make excuses so unconvincingly ^(+23, -5)


- Ugh. What a cynical lie. ^(+34, -8)




- People! Wake up! It can still be stopped! But only all together. ^(+9, -1)


- The air defense of Ukraine is ‘crooked,’ Solovyov said.  Ours is what? Missiles fly to Engels— and only when arrive at Engels are they are shot down—shot down with human casualties, that is. ^(+36, -14)



- What a strange special operation—the Ukrainians themselves demolish their [own] cities, while the Russian military smoke and drown their ships themselves, then they smoke again and the airfields explode into plumes, along with strategic aviation! ^(+33, -5)


  - Which begs the question, [if doing it to themselves] why was mobilization needed in this situation? ^(+7, -0)



    - And the fact that for 9 years Ukrainians have been hammering at the peaceful cities of Donbass, killing both the old and the young, does this not count? ^(+1, -6)


      - But these cities did not look the same all these 8 years as Mariupol did in a few months ^(+7, -1)

           - the militants from the Armed Forces of Ukraine wanted it that way. If they surrendered or left, then there would be no destruction ^(+0, -5)


               - If in 1941 the Soviets had surrendered and gone beyond the Urals, then there would have been no destruction. It is so? ^(+4, -0)



- Previously, they also assured that the troops on the border were not for attack .... and that such claims were Russophobia... ^(+8, -3)


- People!  1/6 of population, land. People are being killed with your hands, you approve of this, you say that you are right, who are you? ^(+7, -0)

- What a pity, very sorry 😢😢😢😢when will it all end!? Stop it, people! The innocent should not die, for what do they suffer such torment 😢😢😢😢😢 ^(+9, -1)



- “Russia does not strike at residential buildings.”  —*brought to you by the authors of* “We will not attack”, “No losses”, “There will be no mobilization”, “Russia is here forever”, “Kherson will not surrender” ^(+34, -2)



- And again, why 300 thousand mobilized if the Ukrainians themselves demolish their cities? ^(+37, -6)

- Until February, for some reason, they did not fire at themselves. ^(+34, -9)",1673933863.0,1673930705.0,t3_10e29yr,t3_10e29yr,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

>The Kremlin continues to publicly challenge Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin’s claims that Wagner Group forces were solely responsible for capturing Soledar, Donetsk Oblast, on January 12.

>Putin attributed the success on the frontlines to the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) and General Staff plans when responding to a journalist’s question on January 15 regarding Russian advances in Soledar.

>Putin’s statement was aired live on state-controlled TV and was likely a deliberate effort to undermine Prigozhin’s influence within the Russian information space, given that Putin has previously refrained from commenting on tactical advances in Ukraine.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin ‘s use of energy as a weapon of financial war is increasingly backfiring, threatening the core of Russia’s beleaguered economy and curtailing its geopolitical influence.  
>  
>Western sanctions, falling prices for Russian fossil fuels and strategic miscalculations are hurting the country’s oil-and-gas industry while the war in Ukraine is poised to stretch into a second year.

>  
>Russia hoped cutting off natural gas would cause Europe to freeze and weaken its support for Kyiv, officials on the continent say. Warm weather and ample supplies from other producers have derailed that effort so far. European gas prices tumbled 15% Monday to levels last experienced in September 2021.  
>  
>The Russian oil industry, meanwhile, is having trouble adapting to a European Union embargo and a U.S.-led price cap on its crude. A Kremlin threat to cut supplies in response failed to boost prices and hasn’t materialized, showing Russia’s weakened hand.  
>  
>Russia has diverted much of the oil that went to Europe, but in doing so it has replaced an array of buyers with two big importers: China and India. Refiners there command low prices, in part because delivering farther afield raises shipping rates.

>The reshuffle is making Russia more reliant on China, threatening to realize longtime fears in Moscow that it would become a junior partner to Beijing.

>**A loving dad and his injured son pay war’s costs in Ukraine**  
>  
>CHERNIHIV, Ukraine (AP) — In a Ukrainian hospital ward for wounded soldiers, where daylight barely penetrates, a father talks to his injured son for hours. Serhii Shumei, 64, never scolded Vitalii for choosing to go to war. Even now, despite the damage done to his son’s brain by an exploding artillery shell, Serhii feels pride, not pity.  
>  
>“I’ve been constantly with him in the last five months, beside him, beside him, beside him,” says Serhii, a retired former soldier himself. “I’m not going anywhere. … except for a smoke.”  
>  
>Vitalii, a 34-year-old long-range anti-aircraft missile commander, was wounded in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine that has become synonymous with horrific losses in ongoing fighting for both Ukraine and Russia. Quite how deadly isn’t known — because neither side is saying. From the stream of wounded soldiers that are coming off frontlines to hospitals like the one where Vitalii lies, it’s evident the costs are severe.  
>  
>Both sides have poured troops and resources to capture or defend Donbas strongholds, fighting over months of grinding, attritional combat to what has largely become a bloody stalemate. After setbacks elsewhere in Ukraine for President Vladimir Putin’s nearly 11-month invasion, Russia is looking for some sort of localized success in the Donbas, even if that just means taking control of a town or two pounded into rubble. Ukraine wants to make Russia’s advances as costly as possible.  
>  
>The Donbas towns of Bakhmut and Soledar have been turned into hellscapes as a result. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described them as “completely destroyed,” strewn with corpses and craters, and with “almost no life left.”  
>  
>“This is what madness looks like,” Zelenskyy says.  
>  
>Vitalii was wounded Aug. 25 on another section of the Donbas frontline, in Adviivka, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) south of Bakhmut. The shell that struck his dugout set off other explosives. The blast tore a crater in Vitalii’s skull that is as deep and broad as half a melon. His brain injuries were so severe that doctors doubted he’d show signs of consciousness again.  
>  
>Now, Vitalii sometimes seems aware of his surroundings. He blinks. He can swallow. But he’s largely immobile.

When will Russians rise up against the government? Why are Iranian women braver than Russian men? Is the reason Russians don't rise up because they are all fascists or cowards (or both)? If Ukraine could rise up against their government, why can't Russians? Where are all these ""good/liberal"" Russians?

In order to answer all of these questions, for the purposes of this write-up, I'd like to frame the question a little more academically as: ""What will it take for Russians to rise up against Putin, and why hasn't it happened yet?""

**Caveat:** As deserving of ridicule, resentment, and ostracisation as the Russian people may be for their complicity in Putin's government and the atrocities in Ukraine, I'd like to put that aside for a moment and try to consider the issue as dispassionately as possible. For that matter, I feel I should make it clear who I am and what my biases and investment is in this matter. I'm a New Zealand citizen living in Russia long-term, married, and employed as a language teacher. I won't give away too much information for safety (anyway there's probably so few kiwis in Russia that I probably already gave too much away, but r/newzealand is quite easily there in my reddit history so hey). I'm strongly anti-Putin, anti-war, pro-total Ukrainian sovereignty and have consistently been so on reddit and in this live thread from day one of the war. The fact that my wife and I are still in Russia, and that we haven't thrown molotovs at policemen yet, has been used to argue that we're at least implicitly supporting the war and the government. There are many reasons why I'm still here, and I'd be happy to go into more detail about why in comments if necessary, and why I don't think this argument is fair. However, that is my context, and if anyone deems that as a basis for calling me pro-Russian/war etc, I accept that. With that aside, here are my thoughts. 

&#x200B;

**Organised Action**

There are two ways that unrest can manifest: in organised action, and spontaneous action. In organised action, groups and leaders coordinate efforts such as strikes, protests, boycotts, etc. to put pressure on a government to react. This works well in democratic countries where there is relatively no consequences for organising such action, let alone participating in them.

However, in order to organise a protest, you need to be active on social media or in public, and you need to have enough people who trust you and are ready to act on your call to action. As we all know, Russia is not a democratic country, and it has spent two decades making sure that no one comes even close to having this sort of organisational power. Now, say what you want about Navalny, but he was probably the closest that Russia ever came to a figure who could unite people against Putin. Nemtsov was a less controversial figure. There are plenty of lesser-known activists who organised action against the Kremlin and they all end up the same way: dead, in prison, or self-exiled in the west. Yes, there is Vesna which tries to organise action from abroad, but there are some reasons to suspect that they are either an FSB operation or completely incompetent due to their utterly haphazard and confusing instructions and how often they cancel events. 

So it seems quite apparent that organised action is functionally impossible in Russia, and that's not really surprising or news to most. I just think that when we discuss or ask about action, it's important that we understand the distinction between organised and spotaneous action, and speaking of which...

**Spontaneous Action**

In a strongly authoritarian society, spontaneous action is what we are left with. A good example of this is what we see in Iran. To some extent, this happened in Ukraine with Euromaidan too - although to my knowledge it began with an organised protest on Facebook.

Spontaneous action, to be clear, is when people perform acts of civil disobedience or violence against the government or its instruments without any prior coordination or organisation. It typically starts when a person or small group commits one act, which emboldens other person or groups to follow on with their own action, and ideally spiralling out of control to the point that it is no longer possible to contain it. 

So what are the requirements for spontaneous action? Well, it's not a science, and every situation is different, but here are some basic ingredients that I believe must be in place for sponatenous action to occur with my elaborations following:

1. An event that strongly impacts a large portion of the urban ethnic Russian population in a negative way, for which it is easy or obvious to blame the government
2. A critical number of unhappy / angry people as a result
3. A successful initial act of unrest against the government
4. Enough successful follow-up acts to overwhelm the police state

**The Inciting Event**

We all thought that mobilisation was going to be it, I guess, even me. But unfortunately, the Kremlin also clearly was aware of that problem, which is why mobilisation is almost entirely happening in regions that don't matter politically (to put it bluntly). Counter to expectations, these republics of ethinic minorities are generally where some of the strongest support for Putin and the military comes from, likely because the army is really the only ""good"" employer for a lot of these impoverished regions. Or at least, it *traditionally* was the best employer. Buryatia and Tuva being the examples I'm mainly aware of, but I imagine it's largely the same in other areas. There are some outliers like Dagestan where people were not happy about being conscripted, but as we've seen, some unrest in these regions is not a threat to the Kremlin. 

There's a reason why I specified a ""large portion of the urban ethnic Russian population"" - i.e. Saint Petersburg and Moscow, and to a lesser extent other large ethnic-Russian cities. These are the only places where unrest could be crippling to the Kremlin. Violence by police against people in Dagestan doesn't even make the news. Violence by police against Russians is much harder to ignore. So of course, mobilisation is still largely a non-issue in these big cities. No one is talking about it, no one is freaking out about it, even now, because largely no one even realises that it's happening.

So what needs to happen is something which really hits Moscow and Petersburg hard. But again, it needs to be something people will attribute to the government. For this reason, as much as it would make a lot of us happy, Ukraine striking Moscow will almost certainly not make unrest more likely. Satisfying and well-deserved? Sure. But if the aim is to create the environment for spontaneous unrest, it needs to be something that even those that support Putin find hard to stomach.

But there is a risk that people do. That is just a risk they need to take. But they draw the line eventually, such as  disallowing all protest.

Too lazy to read it all but some journalist asked the same question a few months ago and came to a conclusion that most of them are detached from reality and live in 2050's California in their minds or something like that.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,10e29yr,j4qytjp,"**A Critical Number of People**

Political commentators and thinkers on Russia have various generalisations to measure the portion of Fascist / Apathetic / Liberal. Lately I've seen more of the 33/33/33, although personally I believe it's closer to 20/60/20, taking into account that places like Moscow and Petersburg might be more like 10/60/30. These are not scientific values. Polls can give us a rough idea but shouldn't be relied on with any academic certainty. I think they suffice as a rule of thumb however. 

Now, what is the critical number of people who need to be ready to act for spontaneous action to be viable? Well, let's start by assuming that this 20-33% of ""liberal"" Russians doesn't mean 20-33% of the adult population is ready to act and take the associated risks. I'd like to look to Ukraine for some insight here. 

Euromaidan involved around 400,000-800,000 protestors. With an adult population of around 33.7 million people, and around 57% of them polled supporting the Euromaidan protests (also form the wiki link), we can see that around 19.21 million people supported Euromaidan, and around 4% (if we take the upper estimate of 800,000) of that number actively participated. 

If we analyse the Russian adult population of 113 million, consider that 20% of them support action against the government, we get about 22.6 million adults. If we take Ukraine as an example and expect about 4% to be willing to participate under the right conditions, that's about 900,000, just a little bit more than Ukraine. 

But is it enough? Keep in mind that the police state is widely known to number well over a million. Russian police officers alone numbered about 1.1 million from 2012, almost 1 for every 100 adults. In addition, the National Guard (comprised of OMON and Rosgvardiya) numbers between 300,000-400,000. So at full force, the Kremlin is able to dispatch close to 1.5 million enforces to put down unrest. It is quite an easy matter for Saint Petersburg to put ten thousand armoured police in the city centre within a day, as they did during the Navalny protests back in 2021. If they really felt threatened, I'm sure they could manage a hundred thousand if they pulled out all the stops. 

Those are some rather large numbers to overcome. We're probably looking at needing at least several hundred thousand in Petersburg, maybe half a million in Moscow.  
Keep in mind, I'm not necessarily talking about a scenario where this number of people goes face to face against police in some kind of epic showdown. I'm coming from the perspective that people need to feel like they can win. People need to feel that there is enough other people like them. No one wants to go out and leave their kid without a mum or dad just to eat a stun-gun and everyone forgets about it the next day. 

That's not to say it can't happen: 

**A successful initial attempt**

The great thing about spontaneous unrest is that it can appear out of nowhere, and surprise even the people who come to participate in it. It only takes one martyr, one brave leader who stands up and risks death because they either have nothing to lose, or what they'll lose is worth it for the cause. 

Now, keep in mind that I'm not just talking about a random successful act - this has to come in the aftermath of a destabilising event and people being widely outraged. But if those things are in place, a succesful initial attempt can embolden and spur on similar actions from like-minded people. 

**Successful follow-up actions**

The difficult and problematic thing is getting these actions to happen in quick enough succession. After the first act, the Kremlin will be scrambling to get boots on the ground and make sure that nothing else happens. Subsequent acts will be met with harsh violence, very possibly even police using live ammunition if it gets bad enough.   
What happens next is pretty much down to fate. Either enough people will feel enraged by this that it will only provoke further acts against the police, and in that case, the Kremlin has likely lost. It's not impossible that the Kremlin will use extreme measures to terrify its population into submission. Unfortunately, Iran is facing this pressure, and as admirable and inspiring as their continued protests are, it remains to be seen whether they have the momentum to overwhelm the police state. 

**Conclusion**

Ultimately, I don't think it's impossible at all. Every authoritarian nation has its breaking point - some breaking points are certainly much tougher than others (North Korea case in point), and Russia's breaking point is certainly not a walk in the park, but within reach, perhaps even more within reach than Iran. The main problem is this apathetic 33-60% in the cities.   
We need the internal shock that will force them to contemplate the situation they are desperately trying to ignore and shut out. We need some brave souls to pave the way, and more brave souls to follow on from that.   
As a resident in Russia, I can't but hold onto hope that all this can happen. Yes, I accept the criticism that I am a coward for not going out and attacking the state. The criticism that most Russians are responsible for this mess, and for letting it go on is well warranted. For the sake of the Ukrainian people and their land (all of it), this moment could not come soon enough.   
However, as far as a dispassionate analysis of the situation goes, and what we should be looking out for in terms of clues for when it can happen, I hope this post helps.",False,1673976778.0,t3_10e29yr,t1_j4qymyc,,1,18,0,18,1,0,

Is the reason Russians don't rise up because they are all fascists or cowards (or both)? If Ukraine could rise up against their government, why can't Russians?

This is all up to Russia/Russians.

Outsiders can speculate on what or why (or why not) all we want.  But at the end of the day, either Russians will rise up and overthrow the Putin regime, or they will not.


But make no mistake; there are barriers to uprisings in every nation. Not just dictatorships or authoritarian regimes.  Yet they still happen.  I happen to believe that this is the ONLY thing that will stop this conflict, other than forceful military defeat and ejection of occupying forces from Russia.

Things will go much better for Russia, and Russians, if they willingly accept their defeat, withdraw, make amends, and move the fuck on - which is unlikely with this regime in control.

Putin had planned this long ago. He needed Navalny out of the picture to prevent him from organising protests.

Russia knows perfectly well how to build a tank as survivable as the Abrams or a jet as capable as the F-16. They just don't, because doctrinally, it doesn't fit.

Their doctrine would prefer half a dozen inferior tanks produced using the same costs and manufacturing capacity as a single Abrams. Crew survivability when the tank is knocked out is not something they are as bothered about. Maximum speed is not something that matters as much. Sensors that give 20% (say) better battlefield awareness, they believe can be negated by simply having five times as many tanks.

The madness is that (providing you view tank crews as at least as expendable as tanks), they're not wrong. There's nothing inherently *ineffective* about Russian doctrine from an equipment perspective. Their errors lie firmly in their command structure and training.

Part of what makes NATO tanks so deadly is they're designed with a level of autonomy in mind from the tank crew, who can be given high level goals and left to achieve them in adaptive, inventive ways.

The west is providing ammunition and the UK not only announced artillery shells but also that they have been buying soviet model tank parts to supply to Ukraine's existing models.

With that kind of forethought I have no doubt that ammunition has been considered and prepared for.

Ukraine will not run out. Russia is already showing signs of using munitions for missions they are ill-suited to, probably because they are low on certain things (especially missiles).

I think the Biden administration’s decision to send Bradleys rather than M1 Abrams tanks is probably the correct one. The logistics for training, fueling, and repairing M1 tanks would probably require the US to do this work in Poland.  I don’t think Ukraine could handle the work or even the fuel transport inside Ukraine in the time available, to have them in place, in meaningful numbers, with proper support. 

As I read, the Bradleys will be easier to support and service in every respect. The training time for operation and repair will be months shorter, and the fuel is diesel. It’s not just the best bang for the buck. It’s a question of working fast enough. We need to get these vehicles in place, trained operators and mechanics, within a couple months. 

The Bradleys are not tanks, but they can take out tanks, personnel, and provide protective transportation. They are agile, and can be in place sooner than tanks. I think the overall decision to focus on Bradleys rather than M1s makes sense. Their main downside is lack of protective armor. But they are a potent weapon. I believe they can take out a T90 tank with accurate fire from K’s away. 

I am assuming we don’t have 4,000 working M60’s stored in Nevada desert. They would be capable against T70s. The sheer number might compensate for their obsolescence. But my understanding is that we don’t have #s in working order.",1673938898.0,1673938247.0,t3_10e29yr,t1_j4oy6ib,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

>This is very likely a response to the announcement of modern tanks going to Ukraine.

There most modern assets are already in Ukraine. T-14 Armata are not there because there are so few. There would literally be a similar amount of Challenger 2 to Armata if they all went. T-90M Provy 3 are there and all the other variants.

We could see more of these but would require Russia to open new factories.

The fear and paranoia of being purged and sent to the gulags lived with the Russian citizenry long after his death. Never fully trusting your neighbors or colleagues was passed down to each subsequent generation.  Russians that do oppose the government do not know who to trust and they see what happens to those that demonstrate against the government. Even the rich oligarchs are not immune to the consequences. It is easy for us to criticize Russians who do nothing from the safety of our chairs, beds, and couches but Russians have the impossible choice of choosing the safety of their families or opposing the government. 

Now I caveat this with that there are many Russians who hold these horrendous views of Ukraine. However of this majority many of them have no other views to reference theirs with. Many Russians go through their education system being taught nothing but Russian Mir and how Putin is ""Making Russia Great Again""(the calling card of all fascists) and fighting the West that seeks to make Russia irrelevant(I know this to be propaganda). This further reinforced by the Russian government co-opting the Orthodox Church which is just another institution spreading propaganda. While we all tire of hearing the BS  propaganda that Maidan was a US backed coup, and that there is genocide in the Donbas, they don't hear stories of their countries atrocities etc. The Russian people however believe this to be fact there is no free media and anything that contradicts the state is suppressed. Had any of us had the misfortune of being born in Russia the odds would be that this institutionalized propaganda would have been successful in conditioning us.

I have doubts about this version.  Early in the war Germany sent 300,000 detonators and astronomical lengths of cable.  It has not had much impact.  However, consider what caused most of NATO casualties in Afghanistan.  Hard fact is that the Taliban is now in control of Kabul.  300k is more IEDs than Russia had troops in the entire original invasion force. 

USA trainers focussed on cutting up Russian supply lines.  Ukraine learned it so well that Russian tanks ran out of gas on the way to the battle of Kyiv which then did not happen.  That was unexpected.  Imagine the same weapons and training but stretched along a supply line all the way to Lviv.

Also there's the thing about black salaries (not paying tax). I've been on a black salary the whole time I've I've in Russia which helps my conscience as I'm not giving anything to the state (as pathetic as that sounds!). Some of my Russian friends only do black salaries too out of principle, so I guess it can be considered a kind of striking, but not very effective. 

Unemployment is very low and it's not usually hard for employers to find someone else. Ultimately, as with other forms of protest, I think this just comes down to the problem that far too many Russians aren't taking accountability for this, and don't feel united in this.

>The end of the Cold War has had a tremendous impact on the structure, size, and capabilities of the
United States Armed Forces. The Defense buildup period of the early 1980's in which new programs
flourished, is over. At a time when Defense dollars and resources are waning, both successful and
unsuccessful acquisition programs must be closely scrutinized to learn how to most efficiently utilize current
technology, private industry, and the existing industrial base.
One highly-successful acquisition program worthy of study and review is the United States Army's Ml
Abrams Tank Program. This program's acquisition strategy was well-planned and executed, efficiently
managed, and amply supported by all constituents involved in the acquisition process. This analysis of the
Ml Abrams acquisition strategy has provided numerous lessons-learned that can be practically applied to
future major weapon system procurements. This study concludes that program advocacy, continuous
interface between the program office and the end-user community, and continuity of key program personnel
are but a few of the many reasons why the Ml Abrams family of vehicles is the most lethal, survivable,
and technologically advanced main battle tank in the world today.",False,1673984257.0,t3_10e29yr,t1_j4rhdbv,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Should be made very plain to all: nobody in this conflict is a signatory to a cluster bomb ban.  So while it's ""naughty"", it is not technically illegal to use them.

Since they will mostly be used on occupied Ukrainian territory, by Ukrainians interested in liberating that territory, I think the Ukrainians know what they're doing with these.

It would line up with the use if chemical weapons against Kurds and anti-Assad forces in Iraq and Syria. Which is exactly my point. And because of the double speak about chemical weapons as WMDs, it seriously waters down the public perception of them. Especially when used against allies and not US troops or NATO forces. As with Iraq in 03 I think the only thing that would spur a US military response would be attempts to arm terrorists with chemical weapons with the intent to use them on US soil or against civilians in a NATO country.
