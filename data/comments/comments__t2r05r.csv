>“We came to the conclusion that the situation in Ukraine has turned into a war,” said Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. “We will apply the Montreux provisions transparently.”

>Turkey controls both straits under the Montreux convention, granting it the power to block the passage of Russian and Ukrainian warships, providing they are not returning to their permanent bases in the Black Sea.

>The convention means the straits can be blocked if a conflict meets the definition of a war.

>The blocking will likely affect a number of Russian vessels currently in the Mediterranean Sea, including submarines and frigates, some of which belong to Black Sea fleets. A block means that Russian warships will not be able to transit the straits to either provide reinforcements to existing forces or to leave and return in order to assist forces in their invasion of Ukraine.

In televised comments the Russian president said: “Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading NATO members made aggressive statements regarding our country”.

The White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin engaging in a pattern he used before launching the invasion, “which is to manufacture threats that don’t exist in order to justify further aggression.”

The meaning of what Putin announced was not immediately clear. Russia and the United States typically have land- and submarine-based nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not.

If Putin is arming or otherwise raising the nuclear combat readiness of his bombers, or if he is ordering more ballistic missile submarines to sea, then the United States might feel compelled to respond in kind, said Hans Kristensen, a nuclear analyst at the Federation of American Scientists. That would mark a worrisome escalation, he said.

Max Bergmann, a former State Department official, called Putin’s talk predictable but dangerous saber rattling. “Things could spiral out of control,” said Bergmann, now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.

Here’s Sunday’s top headlines on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine so far.

Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries.

Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg responded: “this is dangerous rhetoric”.

Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said.
Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukraine won’t surrender “a single inch of our territory” ahead of the talks, saying no preconditions was “already a victory”.

Ukraine’s capital Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands as Russia has faced a series of military setbacks.

Ukraine claimed its forces repelled a Russian attempt to seize Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city, following fierce fighting and street battles with advancing Russian troops.

The UN refugee agency has said more than 368,000 people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries. Up to 4 million people could become refugees if the situation continues to worsen, the UN said.

Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz said he will spend €100bn on defence in a U-turn over the country’s longstanding military policy.
The World Health Organization warned thousands of lives are at risk by falling Ukrainian oxygen supplies.

Pope Francis said he was “heartbroken” by the war and appeared to take direct aim at Putin by condemning people who “trust in the diabolic and perverse logic of weapons”.

Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Malyar claimed Russian forces have lost about 4,300 servicemen, a figure it was not possible to independently verify.

Turkey called the conflict a “war”, which could lead to the country blocking access between the Mediterranean and Black seas to Russian ships.

The UK foreign secretary Liz Truss said she’s preparing a “hit list” of oligarchs to sanction. She also said the war could spell the “beginning of the end” for Putin and said she would back Britons going to fight for Ukraine as private citizens.

Russian police detained more than 900 people at anti-war protests on Sunday, an independent monitoring organization said, lifting the tally for crackdown arrests to over 4,000.

Over 17 European countries have now blocked airspace access to Russian flights, with Russia retaliating – marking a pivot back towards Cold War-style relations.

- The entire Russian military has been completely exposed as incompetent and toothless, with rampant coordination, logistical, and command problems. If Ukraine holds out, this will only embolden other puppet states to start moving away from Russia's influence.

In Nicosia’s freedom square, in the heart of the divided Cypriot capital, demonstrators gathered this afternoon demanding an end to the war.

“There shouldn’t be war when there are ways to end aggression through dialogue,” said Evgenia, a 14-year-old Russian holding a placard emblazoned with the words “Russians against the war”. She and others chanted: “Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes.”

Sunday’s anti-war rally was the third in as many days. Protestors have also taken to the streets in Limassol, the coastal town long a magnet for high net worth Russians with close ties to the Putin regime.

“We Cypriots have a very bitter experience of war and fear that if this one is not stopped it will expand,” said Christina Christofias with the Cyprus Peace Council which had organised the rally. “So many years after the [1974 Turkish] invasion troops are still here. War should never happen.”

“The war must end immediately!” the peace council said in a statement. “Human lives mustn’t be sacrificed once again for the sake of whatever interests and profit. The peoples of Ukraine and Russia, as well as the region of Eastern Europe, have nothing to gain from war and military conflicts.”

It states that, during hostilities, ‘this Policy provides for the prevention of an escalation of military actions and their termination on conditions that are acceptable for the Russian Federation and/or its allies’. The main implication of this is that Russia’s nuclear arsenal is the means of preventing or ending military hostiles against Russia and its allies. 

This might be a reference to the concept of ‘escalate to de-escalate’, meaning the use of a limited nuclear strike to make an adversary end a conventional attack. This concept—and whether Russia has operationalized it in military planning—is strongly debated in the West. Although the text of Article 4 does not unequivocally confirm or dismiss Russian adherence to this concept, it seems to describe non-nuclear scenarios in which Russia might rely on nuclear weapons to achieve its military goals.""

BP is to exit its shareholding in Russian oil giant Rosneft, the company has announced.

The firm has been under pressure over its nearly 20% holding - on Friday UK business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is said to have told the oil company’s boss Bernard Looney about his ""concern"" over the involvement.

""Russia's attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region,"" BP chair Helge Lund said in a statement.

""BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change.

He said he doesn’t want troops to move from Belarus to Ukraine and Lukashenko assured him of this.

Zelinskiy said we all need to act pragmatically to achieve our goal and he said Ukraine’s goal was territorial integrity.

You can totally tell that Russia underestimated the resistance they would see.

They planned this as a couple day invasion.  This is why there are over extended units, units out of fuel supplies, clueless people, etc.

You can tell thia based on his reactions to the sanctions.  His ""I don't give a f*ck"" attitude is entirely predicated on the ASSumption that this would have been over in a couple of days.  At that point, he'd say: ""See everyone. Fighting is over and there is a 'peace' treaty.  How about we roll back those sanctions? K thz, bye....""

He also didn't expect them to be as well supplied by other countries with anti-tank/air weapons.  While others are surely not going to escalate this with ground troops, those supplies are a critical reason why this is going to not be quick/easy.

So...... Putin has now realized that he ""has"" to get this over before Monday because:

A) Countries have agreed to send MORE support to Ukraine.  If he doesn't make progress before then, success odds go down.

B) Russian businesses / markets are going to bw in a world of hurt come Monday if sanctions are still in place and there is no end in sight.

C) The longer this goes on, the more incompetent his regime is going to look

D) More and more information is leaking to Russian public about what is actually happening.

From my armchair perspective. It is looking quite bad for him and this may have been a Career Ending Move (CEM) for him.

c51014ebc84ac587e0f52d5010f13179,t2r05r,hynxgvj,"Turkey’s foreign ministry has signaled that it intends to block Russian warships from passing through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits that lead to the Black Sea, a shift in Turkey’s formerly neutral position where officials underlined alliances with both Russia and Ukraine.

“We came to the conclusion that the situation in Ukraine has turned into a war,” said Turkish foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. “We will apply the Montreux provisions transparently.”

Turkey controls both straits under the Montreux convention, granting it the power to block the passage of Russian and Ukrainian warships, providing they are not returning to their permanent bases in the Black Sea.

The convention means the straits can be blocked if a conflict meets the definition of a war.

The blocking will likely affect a number of Russian vessels currently in the Mediterranean Sea, including submarines and frigates, some of which belong to Black Sea fleets. A block means that Russian warships will not be able to transit the straits to either provide reinforcements to existing forces or to leave and return in order to assist forces in their invasion of Ukraine.

Turkish maritime analyst Yörük Isik pointed to satellite imagery showing at least 16 vessels in the Mediterranean. “What we see are 16 ships, some of them are Black Sea fleet ships. They might have some additional assets including replenishment tankers or small patrol crafts near Tartus but these are the most meaningful assets,” he said.

Çavuşoğlu’s remarks about the closure of the straits also signalled a shift in Turkish policy that until now has carefully tried to balance its NATO commitments and alliance with Ukraine in tandem with its energy and security dependency on Russia.

Turkey’s position has shifted rapidly over the weekend, including remarks earlier today from president Erdogan’s chief advisor Ibrahim Kalin, who said “we will continue our efforts to help the people of Ukraine and end bloodshed in this unjust and unlawful war.” Until now, Turkish officials had chosen their words carefully, primarily using terms such as “military operation.”

Turkey’s move to close the straits is a signal that its current foreign policy is prioritizing Europe and its NATO commitments over its long-term ties to Russia.

“Turkey has a dependency on Russia, not only on energy like some European countries, but also their security situation. There must be fears within the authority that Russia could green-light an attack by the [Syrian] regime on Idlib,” said Ülgen, referring to province in northern Syria controlled by opposition forces including jihadists, with a Turkish presence to deter Russian and Syrian attacks.

“Stop War, Stop Putin” was the slogan displayed on many banners, with others asking: “Why not simply peace?” The demonstrators were scheduled to gather on the wide 17. Juni boulevard between the Brandenburg Gate and the Victory Column in Berlin’s city centre, but authorities were forced to expand the designated area to neighbouring streets in order to ensure coronavirus restrictions could be followed. Trade unionists, church goers, environmental activists, peace groups as well as unaffiliated individuals gathered.

Frank Werneke, head of the large trade union Verdi, said the demonstration was an important signal of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, in light of the dramatic scenes unfolding there. He said the demonstration was against Putin, not Russia stating: “It’s important to state that Putin is not Russia.”

Elsewhere Reuters and the Press Association reported:

In Prague around 80,000 protesters thronged the central square, with the Czech prime minister telling the crowd the country still remembered its own terror of Russian tanks rolling into the capital more than five decades ago.

In Madrid, thousands of protesters waved Ukrainian flags. They held signs reading “Peace”, “Stop Putin”, and “Putin, you should be scared: my grandmother is really angry”.

In London thousands of demonstrators gathered in Trafalgar Square, and many Russians joined the rally, led by Ukrainian community leaders, holding up placards with messages like: “Russians do not want the war”. Several described the “very close” ties between the two countries, calling Ukrainians “brothers and sisters” and “best friends”

In Denmark, roughly 400 demonstrators gathered in front of the Ukrainian embassy in central Copenhagen where many participants lit candles and laid flowers to show their support for the Ukrainian people.

""Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that missiles hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kiev overnight but there were **no reports of damage to the building or any indications of a radioactive release**, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said.

The State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) told the IAEA that both its communications with the facility – the Kiev branch of the State Specialized Enterprise ""Radon"" – and the radiation monitoring system at the site had been restored during the morning. SNRIU said it expects to soon receive the results of on-site radioactive monitoring. Staff at the facility were forced to take shelter during the night but could later assess the situation.

The incident came a day after SNRIU said an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been damaged, also without any reports of a radioactive release. Such facilities  typically hold disused radioactive sources and other low-level waste from hospitals and industry.

“These two incidents highlight the very real risk that facilities with radioactive material will suffer damage during the conflict, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment,” Director General Grossi said.""

> 
> While Russia’s advance on Ukrainian cities continued to be slowed by ferocious resistance from Ukrainian troops, as well as by Russia’s own logistical and sustainment challenges, the adoption of what a senior Defense Department official characterized as a “siege mentality” around Chernihiv opens a new shift in the war.
> 
> Pentagon officials said previously that they expected Russia aimed to isolate and lay siege to Kyiv, the capital, as part of President Vladimir V. Putin’s effort to decapitate the democratically elected government of President Volodymyr Zelensky.
> 
> The Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per Biden administration guidelines, said in a briefing to reporters that Russian forces had increased rocket attacks in Chernihiv. Russian troops, he said, “are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics know that when you do it, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage to civilian life and infrastructure.”
> 
> He also said that top Pentagon leaders learned that Mr. Putin had put his nuclear forces on alert when they had all gathered for a battle meeting on Sunday morning. The official called the move “unnecessary and escalatory” and said that Mr. Putin had put in play the chance that a “miscalculation could make things much more dangerous.”
> 
> But he said that the United States remained confident in its strategic deterrent posture as well as its ability to defend itself, its allies and its partners.
> 
> Russia still has not managed to achieve air superiority over Ukraine, the Pentagon said. The Defense Department official said that Ukraine had retained an ability to mount an air defense, and was still putting war planes into the air.
> 
> Russian troops mounting an amphibious assault near Mariupol in the south had gotten within 50 kilometers of the city, the official said. Ukrainian forces were expected to put up a resistance there.

# The behavioral model and game theory

>  The rational choice theory is based on this idea that people rationally pursue goals for increasing their personal interests. Here, we present a new concept of rational choice as a hyper-rational choice in which the actor thinks about profit or loss of other actors in addition to his personal profit or loss and then will choose an action that is desirable to him. We implement the hyper-rational choice to generalize and expand the game theory. Results of this study will help to model the behavior of people considering environmental conditions, the type of behavioral interaction, valuation system of itself and others, and system of beliefs and internal values of societies. Hyper-rationality helps us understand how human decision-makers behave in interactive decisions.

Here's a short thread on the nuclear posture change that can give some perspective. Remember, we've been here before for half a century. This isn't new. The world knows how to prevent it from escalating.


https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1497937591710195717?s=21

> First, this is a deterrence action against the west, both conventionally and western sanctions. It's a big 'keep out' sign, not a real intent to escalate to nuclear force or aimed at ukr.

> From the operations so far, it looks like R intended a morale victory with fast surrender of UA forces. That didn't pan out, and this conflict is likely to escalate savagely with new commitments of conventional force. This is a 'keep out of it' to the west

> The two big sanctions that rise to the level of a strategic threat are the sanctions against the central bank, and airspace closures making RU mainland-Kaliningrad connections look precarious

> The inevitable response to the R nuclear posture change is that nuclear forces elsewhere will now also go to high readiness

> Unfortunately, there is a good chance those postures will remain on high alert on both sides now until the conflict ends. Which could be a while. The huge risk is not so much immediate, but mistakes and missignalling that leads to horrific consequences until that happens

> Key thing now is for the leaders of nuclear powers to make clear that *they* will not be the source of that escalation, and to recognize the real red lines that can lead to it

> So EU, US, and leaders of those powers need to signal quickly and loudly the circumstances under which escalation can occur. Namely, no use without a strike by R, and to loudly commit that they understand and will not step over the red line triggers

> For example, while airspace closures in EU will occur, under no circumstances will transit or logistics between R and Kaliningrad be disrupted. Under no circumstances will their conventional forces engage directly with R forces.

> That sanctions will be severe and life-changing to R, it's govt, and it's people, but will, under no circumstances, rise to the level of preventing R undertaking its core sovereign activities

> And that responses in cyberspace will not be taken that that have the functional or kinetic effect of disabling the core infrastructure necessary in a modern sovereign nation that would, under LOAC, rise to the level of an armed attack

> During this period, defense ministers, foreign ministers, and heads of state should be particularly careful to ensure that they do not announce new policies or sanctions without consulting with experts and lawyers to ensure they don't unexpectedly step over those lines

> This doesn't escalate to nuclear conflict by itself, it needs serious miscommunication to get there, but given how uncareful EU was in reading R MFA prior to conflict, and how uncareful talk has been since, it is important now for them to be much more careful in signalling

> That all said, this is bad news for everyone, but also a really really ominous sign for ukr that this war is going to get a lot, lot more ugly in conventional force very soon.",False,1645982144.0,t3_t2r05r,t3_t2r05r,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

He started a war, ok there’s the problem. But now that the war is here, it won’t likely stop. Putin won’t back out. The sanctions imposed will only provoke the war more, and definitely won’t be an insensitive to stop it. Why would he back out when losing all these things? He’s only going to strike back harder. Secondly, yes, innocent civilians are dying, and that shouldn’t be happening, but there, I blame the army itself. I doubt Putin is directing the army to strike this residence and that residence, and rather the army is acting on its own accord in those situations. Putin’s initial reason for war is, in my opinion, a completely valid one (no, not the Naziism shit), and while I believe it should’ve been resolved without war at all, it would silly to say right now that the war will stop as I had just explained earlier.

I won’t respond to those who attempt to strike argument rather than answer my question.

Also, I’m Canadian, don’t start rioting.

Germany has had a policy of ""Never again"" since the Second World War, whereby they have resolved that disagreements would not be solved through military force. They were also spending well below the 2% of GDP on military spending that is theoretically required of NATO members. (This is theoretical because other countries have for a long time not met this threshold, for example Iceland is a NATO member and doesn't even have a military. One of Former President Trump's grumbles about NATO was that the US was carrying it financially, which there is a lot of truth to.)

The shift today enshrines in the German Constitution that Germany will meet this 2% rule, so it's a large increase in military spending (€100 bn+) and future governments won't be able to revoke it easily.

This action also comes alongside large weapons shipments to Ukraine. So this is a huge policy shift, and is buoyed by a popular shift. Reportedly, 68% of Germans last year disapproved of Germany sending weapons to Ukraine. So the new German Government did very little until now, infamously sending 5,000 helmets in the last few days, which they were lambasted for online.

Per Wiki nothing against ICBMs  
Three shorter range tactical anti-ballistic missile systems are currently operational: the U.S. Army Patriot, U.S. Navy Aegis combat system/SM-2 missile, and the Israeli Arrow missile. In general short-range tactical ABMs cannot intercept ICBMs, even if within range (Arrow-3 can intercept ICBMs).\[27\] The tactical ABM radar and performance characteristics do not allow it, as an incoming ICBM warhead moves much faster than a tactical missile warhead. However, the better-performance Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile could be upgraded to intercept ICBMs. The SM-3 missile may have some capability against ICBMs, as demonstrated by the 2008 satellite shootdown.  
  
Latest versions of the U.S. Hawk missile have a limited capability against tactical ballistic missiles, but is not usually described as an ABM. Similar claims have been made about the Russian long-range surface-to-air S-300 and S-400 series.

That's not counting the time needed to acquire and load the equipment, and that time is highly variable depending on how they source these.

So minimum 1 day for arrival across Ukraine border at the earliest, and considering they arrive from the west, they'll have to traverse Ukraine to where the fight is. Ukraine is not a small country, that's a lot like driving acrossed Texas or Germany and France combined. Even to Kyiv from Polish or Romanian border is over 200 miles. So realistically another 12-48hrs to delivery and distribute to front lines after arriving inside Ukraine. Depends on logistics inside of ukraine. I doubt it's slow, given the urgency of what's going on, but they do have to be careful as there's a war on.

The only thing that would make it more complicated (when the president would need help from others) is if they wanted to deviate from the pre-planned stuff.

But if they go for the pre-planned stuff only not following orders can save the world. Yeah, that‘s right: in the US a single person can order nuclear weapon use and no one has a veto or has to be consolidated.

Given MAD I’m not sure it could be any other way and I have a hard time believing that it should be any different in Russia.

This is the reality we live with and have to be aware of. It has always been like this.

Big loosers of this war are Europe and China.

Russia got it to spike the prices of fuel and food. Both things Russia and America are self-supplied and that China and Europe lack in their economies.

The rest of it is just propaganda and, sadly, real human casualties.

US got strong in its block with this conflict, clearly European leadership showed to be of no use without the USA.

And clearly Russia got to shift the relative strength relation to the interior of its block, showing China: I can be rogue, and I can get to sell you stuff for more money than yesterday.


Don't you think it's strange that just one day after the breakout of war US journalists acknowledged that they knew the Russians had fake 3d printed planes at the border where the supposed ""army build up"" was taking place? Both classic Cold War powers can be deeming this war convenient

Meanwhile the whole population gets convinced and diverted of where the true interests of this war are: shared by Russia and the US.

As of this moment China is reacting to Europe's will to continue this war (and it's subsequent economic damage to their own economy) by moving Intel for African countries to start an uprising against France's influence.

It's escalating globally. But please, don't just align with governments. Governments are part of the problem here",False,1645977552.0,t3_t2r05r,t1_hynmi8t,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

But the writing is on the wall. Russia lost.

Zelensky can be captured of killed.

Russian troops can occupy every city in Ukraine.

A puppet government can be installed by Putin.

And it won't matter. It won't change a damn thing. The West is now united, NATO is no longer fucking around, China is pissed and looking sideways, and the optics are absolutely terrible for the world's greatest sunflower seed manufacturer.

Not to mention the endless and brutal insurgency that would follow, should Russia occupy the country (which they still technically can). It would be body bags for years to come.

Even if Russia pulls out now, their economy is boned. Loyalty in a totalitarian state is based on fear and favors. If your economy is shit, everyone starves, and fear of your wrath quickly becomes fear of starvation. When you have people with nothing left to lose, shit gets ugly real fast. And that makes those who have the know-how and power to right the ship, even if they're corrupt, start thinking, fuck it, why not kill him?

And the cultural impact - oof. You can bet your ass that Comrade Fish-lips is going to be filleted in books, film, music, comedy, etc. for a very long time to come. Optics matter, and there's nothing Weasel Eyes Botox Face can do to change the fact that everyone knows he fucked up.

Even if his own people don't off him - and that's a big if - Mr. Look-At-Me-I-Can-Do-Judo is now a pariah of the highest order.

Of course he's still dangerous. But the world has collectively said enough. And his cronies were in it for comfort, riches, and whores. They couldn't give less of a fuck about reviving the ""glories"" of Mother Russia. They want to eat caviar on their yachts while supermodels lick their assholes. And they are not above introducing Ferret Fuck to an open window.

Zelensky is on the opposite end of the spectrum. I'd wager a fair amount that there's a lot of people in his country who would fucking die for him. Oligarch Put-Put-Ingrown-Nail-In-My-Brain has yes men who more than likely hate the shit outta him.

* Everyone and their mother is sanctioning Russia. US and EU agreed to kick the country off of SWIFT, which will likely cause the economy to collapse. Both are also working to seize the oligarchs' Western assets: their mega-yachts, mansions, stuff like that. 
* Notably, the EU itself is now giving military aid to Ukraine, not just its member states. Germany's announced they're tripling their defense budget from last year to get the Bundeswehr into fighting shape.
* Russia claims they're willing to open negotiations. Zelensky's agreed to give it a try, even though he says he's pretty sure the Russians aren't serious about it. 
* At the same time, there are reports that Putin's ordered the Russian army to take Kyiv by tomorrow evening. When his generals told him that wasn't possible without massive Russian casualties -- an estimated 50,000 boys dead-- he reportedly ignored them and ordered them to do it anyways.
* Putin's talking big about putting Russia's nuclear warheads on high alert. The White House seems to think this is a bluff, but it's concerning nonetheless. Russian defense officials look visibly unconformable during the meeting where Putin announced this (where, of course, he's sitting at the far end of an absurdly long table. WTF is up with that?)
* Anti-war protests continue in Russia. There's a video on the front page showing protestors fighting back against the police to save a young woman from being dragged off by them; unclear if an isolated incident or the start of a broader trend.",1645984863.0,1645984511.0,t3_t2r05r,t1_hynz5lk,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

The other part of your question, can we hit it in first place depends on a lot of factors. Highest chance of success is to hit it as close to launch as possible, when it it traveling the slowest. 

Russia and China have both considered deploying effective anti ICBM systems close to their boarders as being an escalation, so development and deployment of defensive systems have at least publicly been scaled down as a part of disarmament treaties.

However, they don't have anything close to a 100% hit rate (closer to fifty percent best case) due to how fast ICBM's fall towards their target (they literally fly into space then fall to their target at hypersonic speeds). 

Also, even if you intercept them it does not mean you neutralize the warhead, you just keep it from hitting it's target by damaging the delivery system. The warhead could trigger mid-air or fall from the intercept point to land on whatever is below it. Probably would not go off, but it's possible. 

Also important to remember, many modern ICBM's have what is called a MIRV warhead delivery system. MIRV stands for multiple  independently targetable reentry vehicle. Essentially, it's a system that delivers multiple warheads to a general geographic area, say the United States or Russia, and then the warheads split off from the delivery system, and self target towards their destination. 

One ICBM' armed with this system can deliver anywhere from three to sixteen warheads, each around ten to fifty times more powerful then the bombs dropped on Japan in WW2. Depending on which countries system your looking at. Russian warheads are typically more powerful to compensate for poorer targeting systems while western countries typically are the opposite.",False,1645980136.0,t3_t2r05r,t1_hynqxn3,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

I honestly think the west might need to back off on this one. If we're being pragmatic and working solely off the basis of reducing the risk of ww3 the west needs to scale back on these giant military alliances because there's too much at stake if one member behaves too aggressively/or becomes a rogue state which is a concern if you look at countries like Turkey/Hungary that are becoming increasingly autoritarian. 

Instead we should look at working with every other potential target to reduce the need for these alliances in first place.

About 10-12 days from now, Russia will no longer have the ability to continue to make war. They might be able to still shoot missiles or drop bombs, but they won’t have the fuel, bullets, food, or other supplies necessary to fight a land war and occupy Ukraine.

They are already struggling to manufacture ammunition. They keep losing transport planes and trucks. This isn’t WWII, where Germany manufactured a war machine before going to Poland; this is a poor Russia desperately lashing out with the limited capacity they have.

OFCOM is the organization that can pull broadcast rights, and they cover the issue as this:

>But there is no ban on partisan current affairs broadcasting in the UK, as long as viewers are also exposed to some alternative viewpoints

So unless you're telling viewers to go out and commit acts of terrorism, with no counterargument, then it's free speech, and protected.

Also this is from the BBC:

>There are also bigger forces at play. The expectation is that if RT is taken off air in the UK, then the BBC’s Russian services will be quickly binned by the Kremlin – the same fate that befell the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the German media regulator took RT off air earlier this month. In any eventuality, there would be nothing to stop RT continuing to produce online content for a British audience, free from regulation, while claiming to have been silenced.

>Bakhurst said the British media regulator would take this into account when considering any enforcement activity: “We’d be mad not to think of the wider implications, not just for BBC journalists based in Russia but for Ukraine.”

>This has led to BBC sources raising concerns that removing RT’s broadcast licence would be unhelpful, given how few viewers RT has in the UK. The channel took the unusual decision to pull out of the Barb audience rating system in late 2019.

That video is a simple primer to the world of geopolitics, but he does a good overview. However, it's a mistake to think that's the end all and be all of it. It's very reductionist, and that's not how people and politics operate.

I recommend looking at Strategy Stuff for instance, just to get a more deeper, insightful look at how geopolitics come into play. Keep in mind though that nothing beats a big, fat book written by an academic that have spent their life on the subject matter. For something lighter that's on YouTube, check out Imperial Japan: The Fall of Democracy by Kraut and The Grand Strategy of Japan, 1919 - 1941 by Strategy Stuff together for a more cohesive case to take in. You'll start to realize there is a lot at play here than just resources, such as how they intend to obtain said resources among other things.

You need to factor the major personalities at play, various ideologies that are competing with each other, internal politics that may or may not be happening, what sort of pressures that they may be dealing with internally and externally, what sort of influence China may have had, and so forth.

At that point if Putin decides to launch, then the order would almost certainly be given in NATO to fire upon Russia - they can't take the risk of Putin launching more missiles at them even if Ukraine isn't a part of NATO, because of Ukraine's close proximity to NATO countries.

If *that* happens, depending on how many Russia has blown in which direction, then more would be headed towards Western nations. Nations with nukes that are hostile to the West, such as Iran or North Korea, would almost certainly fire them as well.

At ***that*** point, all of this would certainly mean that much of the airspace is occupied by nukes raining down on the world. Them reaching their destination depends on how functional they are (if the Russians' nukes are as functional as their army here, for instance, it may not be endgame for sure), and how functional anti-missile defenses would be.

Probable outcome: eradication of much of the human race, unlivable conditions in what remains of the world.

Possible outcome: All of this one's big flub and Russia gets obliterated instantly.

At the same time, as Russian armour begins to enter more urban areas they're exposed to more potential ambushes -- which is probably why we're getting more news of destroyed Russian IFVs now rather than a few days ago when they were probably still advancing over relatively flat terrain.

Armour still proved their worth in the various American invasions of other countries -- the US logistics are pretty damned decent and they certainly had air superiority in most of their operations.

The Indian Communist Party got wind of our under-the-table “gifts” and was understandably upset, but we were not naive and put our money on the party that was likely to continue leading India. The KGB had several agents and informers in Indira Gandhi’s entourage, and they told her that the large contributions came from sources in the Soviet Union, though her aides may not have told her the money was actually from the KGB.”

# The behavioral model and game theory

>  The rational choice theory is based on this idea that people rationally pursue goals for increasing their personal interests. Here, we present a new concept of rational choice as a hyper-rational choice in which the actor thinks about profit or loss of other actors in addition to his personal profit or loss and then will choose an action that is desirable to him. We implement the hyper-rational choice to generalize and expand the game theory. Results of this study will help to model the behavior of people considering environmental conditions, the type of behavioral interaction, valuation system of itself and others, and system of beliefs and internal values of societies. Hyper-rationality helps us understand how human decision-makers behave in interactive decisions.

Think of Taiwan as the opposite of Donbask. It's an area recognized with an independent government, but a long history of being officially recognized as part of the PRC.

So if Ukraine wins the war, and there's a justification. Now China has a precedent to try to stop the US if they were to try to ""liberate"" Taiwan for an oppressive Chinese government. Just as it was wrong of Russia to try to ""liberate"" the east side of Ukraine.

Sure it's not the same situation. But China just has to try to make it as much as they can.

Alternatively, if Russia somehow gets away with this, China now realizes that the rules of what can be done are more flexible, and they can get away with being more aggressive towards Taiwan, and maybe annex some extra territories with the same justification.

And in the end China is fine with this because as long as Russia is doing this, it's draining resources away from the EU, US, and meanwhile China is the only super-power that gets to not waste any resources around, just keep them.

I mean you are asking me to prove something that can't be statistically proven and honestly I think you know that. Ideology cannot be tracked via pure statistics but it is absolutely one of the starting points of dismantling a society. I am in no way saying to slam the door shut, but having the door always open is a recipe for disaster in your own home. You ever get flies in your house if you leave the door open too long? 

And you share that home with other people, it's not just you in that home. The decision in who should be let in should be one that the majority agrees upon. That needs to be understood across both spectrums (xenophobes and non-xenophobes) and honestly when I read through your comments and your profile I can see that doesn't really resonate with you. 

To me that is an incredibly dangerous and almost gullible mindset. One that puts my safety in danger. I just want to follow one side that lays out all the positive and negatives from all scenarios. Not one that cherry picks and makes theirs looks better than the other. That screams ""fishy"" to me and makes me distrust you even more. Not everything is gumdrops and roses and if that's the only thing you are going to present to me, I know for a fact you are hiding something.",False,1645984785.0,t3_t2r05r,t1_hyo1whm,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Unfortunately things are moving super fast and most of the articles on topics are super new and older articles are buried. Whenever I search for articles about Biden and SWIFT or direct sanctions on Putin, it just says Biden has ruled it out for now and doesn't elaborate on whether or not that's because he was hesitant or because Europe wasn't in line. 

I thought I remembered seeing articles that said sources close to Biden said he was hesitant to take more drastic measures, especially because he was concerned about the ripple effect that could have on Americans and the American economy.
