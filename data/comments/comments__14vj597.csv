>Russia is almost certainly struggling with a crisis of combat medical provision, after suffering an average of around 400 casualties a day for 17 months.

>The influx of military casualties has likely undermined the normal provision of some Russian civilian medical services, especially in border regions near Ukraine. It is likely that many dedicated military hospitals are being reserved for officer casualties.

>As claimed by the head of the Kalashnikov company’s combat medicine training division, it is likely that up to 50 per cent of Russian combat fatalities could have been prevented with proper first aid. Very slow casualty evacuation, combined with the inappropriate use of the crude in-service Russian combat tourniquet, is reportedly a leading cause of preventable fatalities and amputations.

This praise is especially notable as he gave an interview two months ago when he critiqued the Ukrainian high command for being reckless with soldiers’ lives in attacking unsuppressed Russian positions.

He thinks the high command has learned, and is employing a methodical strategy that conserves manpower and focuses on gaining artillery superiority. In around 2 months’ time, he believes that just like Kherson, Ukraine will gradually gain a significant artillery edge over the Russians. Once that happens, advances will occur, and once the general retreat begins, only then will the uncommitted brigades be unleashed on the fleeing Russian forces.

But then came cluster munitions, which began to explode overhead. “You know where you are with mortars. With clusters you’re in one of two camps: lucky or unlucky.” Tsar escaped with shrapnel injuries in the soft tissue of his backside, from which he is recovering in the local hospital.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-10-23/index.html

""Two leading liberal US senators voiced concerns on Monday over President Joe Biden’s decision to transfer cluster munitions to Ukraine.

“I am deeply concerned about the use of a weapon that has such terrible long-term consequences for civilians,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN.

Sen. Bernie Sanders also said he had ""concerns” about the president’s move.

More background: Cluster munitions scatter “bomblets” across large areas that can fail to explode on impact and can pose a long-term risk to anyone who encounters them, similar to landmines. Over 100 countries, including the UK, France and Germany, have outlawed the munitions under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but the US and Ukraine are not signatories to the ban.""",False,1689031760.0,t3_14vj597,t3_14vj597,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

All through the war we've had this contradiction between those sorts of numbers and the daily [assessments we see from Ukraine](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1677294895088713731) that puts KIA far higher (currently 234k) and WIA even moreso (currently 703k).

I realise it's incredibly hard to count these properly, especially with Russia cremating their KIAs and returning wounded to fighting without proper treatment. And I've heard the argument that the high number is just UA estimating whereas the low number is confirmed open source type data, but in the case of this tweet it's not even that, it's machine learning based.

The size of this numerical gulf increases almost exponentially, so as time passes it's getting more and more extreme.

EDIT: For those doubting this, Ukraine's own Defence Ministry saying 232k 'eliminated personnel': [https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1677294895088713731](https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1677294895088713731)

>**Almost every living former Austrian chancellor, for example, looked east for employment after leaving office.** Wolfgang Schüssel, ex-chancellor for the center-right People’s Party, joined the boards of Russian mobile telecommunications operator MTS and oil giant Lukoil. His Social Democratic successor, Alfred Gusenbauer, went to work for the “Dialogue of Civilizations Research Institute,” a pro-Russian think tank set up by a Putin crony. Christian Kern, another Social Democrat, went on the board of the Russian state railway RZD.

...

>The extent to which Austria’s leaders had painted the country into a corner with Russia became clear in during a state visit by Putin in 2014, just weeks after he’d annexed Crimea and triggered a war in eastern Ukraine.

>Leitl went on to remind Putin that exactly 100 years earlier part of Ukraine belonged to Austria. “What suggestions do you have?” Putin asked, adding to loud laughs that he was afraid to hear Leitl’s answer. **As they enjoyed the joke, Austria’s then-President Heinz Fischer reached over to pat Putin on the back.** Earlier that day, Fischer had received the Russian president with full military honors in the Hofburg, the former imperial palace of the Habsburgs.

...

>**Western officials warned Vienna for years after Crimea that its security services had been infiltrated by the Russians**, for example, and were brushed off.
In 2020, Jan Marsalek, the fugitive Austrian executive at the center of the Wirecard scandal, one of the biggest financial frauds in history, **escaped to Russia via Vienna and Minsk, allegedly with the help of former Austrian intelligence operatives.** But it took the exposure of a suspected high-ranking mole in the service in 2021 and the suspension of Austria from Western intelligence sharing for the country to act. **By then, the problems were so severe that the government decided to disband its intelligence service altogether and start over.**

Their medical response to injuries has been absolutely trash for a modern military (yes, I know the jokes). We've been getting word for quite sometime that the basic medical knowledge of their troops is so lacking, that they are using tourniquets inappropriately, leading to a higher rate of death and amputation.

The normal rates of casualties in war tends to be.

 * On the offense: For every 1 defender lost, 3 attackers are lost.

 * Of the casualties: For every 1 KIA, there's ~3 WIA.

 * Of the wounded: 50% can return to duty, 50% have received some permanent loss of function and are no longer suitable.

But russia's observed trends are completely out of whack.

It's among the higher numbers for estimates due to a range of factors so let me cover a few considerations.

Allied estimates are by nature conservative, on basic logic you don't want to underestimate enemy strength but it's actually a byproduct of their methodology. We don't know how each nations intel works it out but there was a video about it early on. One methodology (probably US IIRC) is to take estimates by each side, punch in a range of factors to come out with a casualty range.

There is an issue with this though as it assumes both sides lie equally and is therefore subject to what I call 'averaged truth'. This isn't great as we know Russia tells lies in pretty epic proportions.

As for Ukraine's estimates, we have a few things to work with. Firstly, they are updated daily so at minimum we can at least extrapolate intensity and trends. The other main point is early on in the war there were a few leaks in Russian media of KIA numbers, those numbers were remarkably close to Ukraine's claimed numbers. (for context it was in the opening month or two when count was at 10-15k).

The other thing is based on publicly available numbers and treatment of WIA by Russia, we can logic that normal 1:3 ratios of KIA:WIA are likely too generous and it's more likely to be something like 1:1.5.

Now when we start estimating the number of troops on the ground vs Ukraine's estimates we get to the point where Ukraine's estimates are probably a little high even with a 1:1.5.

My personal guess is that Ukraine's claimed KIA may be 10-20% high. But even that is an absurd number of KIA but would also explain initiative trends.

But at the end of the day - it's largely pointless, about all these estimates do is provide trending details, we can see what Ukraine is targeting, how intense things are, etc.

Even after the war, scholars and analysts will debate casualty rates for years, they still do for WW2... Even then it's imprecise and a range is given, WW2 a common one is 50-80 million. 30 million people is a hell of a lot to be unsure about.",False,1689024331.0,t3_14vj597,t1_jreeuw4,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

That Vienna ""brushed off"" warnings about Russians spies for example is bs and I hope you notice how the author claims that without following up with any evidence. If western services gave Austria *concrete* information about Russian spies they would be taken seriously and several Russians have been kicked out of the country that way. One time Russia even closed Austria's embassy in Moscow in protest. 

Besides, *Austria has warned the US that Russia is attacking CIA agents and the US was like ""na they're just so paranoid they gave themselve a concussion.* Austria has also warned her partners that Russian and Turkish secret service activity is getting more aggressive and that it might mean danger for Ukraine weeks before the war which wasn't taken seriously either.

Vienna is sometimes named the world's #1 diplomatic city, of course there's a lot of spying activity here. But it's not soley Russian and cases of individuals being recruited don't say much about Austria's stance - most of those who were found out were spying against Austria and her people which is obviously not something Austria knowingly allows.

For propaganda, yes.  Remember, Russian propaganda has three phases:

1. Seeding.  A broad range of views on any given subject are spread across the infosphere.  Some are contradictory.
2. Harvesting.  Which of the seeds grew, i.e. which ones are the infosphere talking about?  Those are the ones used for the next step.
3. Amplification.  Encouraging others, i.e. ""[useful idiots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot)"", to copy,  add to, and repost the narrative to make it louder.

But the thing is, Iraq didn't really have minefields - it had IEDs eventually, but AFAIK there was not any serious amount of entrenched fortifications the US was breaking. So the unexploded ordnance problem was serious because it removed options you had (free maneuvering around enemy positions).

Contrasting with the situation in Ukraine, where Russia has something like 1500 mines per square kilometer in some parts of the front, and fires their own cluster munitions at Ukranian sappers as they clear highways.

So this I completely disagree with. One of the most commonly accepted faults of the Ukraine counter offensive so far is how long they've taken to do it. They unfortunately gave Russian engineers plenty of time to build extremely dense defenses and extensive minefields which have slowed Ukrainian progress to a crawl. 

Part of the reason Ukraine is pushing so hard into Bakhmut is because the Russians haven't had enough time to build these extensive fortifications there yet. It's also why Russia is committing so many soldiers to it; they don't have defensive fortifications built up so they're just throwing bodies at the Ukrainians to slow them down until they do.

Ukraine is also experiencing an extreme lack of Artillery ammunition, which they've openly complained about and frequently requested. Ukraine doesn't win a war of artillery attrition with Russia.

Rumors has it that they actively obfuscate, casualties, by letting bodies disappear/do not care at all to retrieve them. No hard evidence for that, though.

Still, recently there is lots of footage of rotting corpses and skeletons showing up. When it's hot, decomposition and even skeletization can happen quite fast, still, they at least had a  couple of days to weeks to retrieve those casualties.

Meanwhile, for Ukraine, they had some  MIA data, assuming around 20k soldiers currently missing (MIA and desertion) It's mostly anecdotal evidence, but I'm still quite confident that Ukraine does a far better job of retrieving their dead.

Russia also had three major retreats, especially the attack on Kyiv was pretty chaotic. And if they are not able to cart away their dead in a territory they at least controlled for days to weeks after death occurred before having to retreat, it's safe to assume that the overwhelming majority of casualties during this section and phase of the war are completely unaccounted for.

They basically rely on excess mortality rate, but any MIA data won't show up, obviously. Therefore, MIA is a huge weak spot, in this whole thing.

But discussion is great, so no problem with you objecting to certain points in the article.

Your main objection seems to be the framing of Austrian intelligence services as being largely compromised. And you make some fair points. But you also haven't provided sources or evidence, but I assume that will be forthcoming in your edit.

But you haven't addressed most of the rest of the article. Which includes the claims that Austrian chancellors and ministers have a disturbing habit of joining Russian companies and think tanks after office. And the part about former president Leitl laughing it up with Putin only weeks after he illegally seized Crimea. And Austria's unwillingness to disengage economically with Russia post the full-scale invasion.

I do not think all Austrians are Russophiles, and many support Ukraine, but I do think the business sector and governments strong ties to the Kremlin have tempered anything close to a strong response from Vienna.

EDIT: I see your comment link now. You make some good refutations in the defense of Austria's Russian relationship.

China isn't a peer, in the sense that their tech, training and experience are all well below the US. They are solidly in the #2 spot on the country list.

What complicates matters though is that the likely scenarios for a shooting war between the US and China all take place near China's physical borders. In missile range.

Folks never believe that.  They have more War Ships than we do. Again, folks don't believe it but look it up. It's public knowledge.  They are building aircraft carriers on an actual assembly line and will outpace us within the next 10 to 15 years in sheer numbers.  That's not all, but let's move on to training.  Their pilots are clocking training flight hours similar to our own.  Remember the knock on Russia at the start of this war?  Their pilots were flying rarely, if ever. Absolutely not the case with China.  In addition, they've been paying western pilots to come over and train their military on western tactics.  This is no joke.  Their planes get flack because they based them on Russian designs.  They realized their error and started building in house after stealing all our F-22 and F-35 plans.  The Chinese J-20 is only the third 5th generation fighter in history behind the two I just mentioned.  No one else has anything like them.  The J-20 has been seen up close by our pilots in the air and assessed to be flown ""pretty well"".  We are very impressed with the maneuvering capability of the jet.  The Chinese are changing the Russian engines in the jet for new engines made entirely in China, indicating they have finally grown comfortable with engine technology.  This jet has a listed top speed faster than the F-35 and the range is nearly double the F-35. It also can carry a larger load out when both are fully loaded.

In short - it would be a major problem for our boats in a conflict.

China has also developed and successfully tested what they call their carrier killer missile.  It's specifically designed to attack and kill American Carriers.

There a ton of problems with China.  Not the least of which is that they spend all their time developing weapons to directly counter our naval doctrine.  For example - Our doctrine states that we put planes up off the carrier and then they refuel immediately.  the F-35 doesn't have a huge range because the expectation was that they'd refuel - go hit whatever the targets were - and refuel on the way back.  China developed missiles that have a far larger range than the F-35 and made sure the J-20 can fire them.  So now - the F-35 isn't the target.  It's the tanker.  Obviously we have realized this and have a few counters in place but they're basically band-aids until they get a true stealth tanker up and running which is only now in the proposal stage.  It'll be a while.

That's just one example.  China is at a minimum near-peer and frankly I have no problem at all considering them a peer regarding a war involving Taiwan or anywhere in that neck of the woods.  We would take massive losses and I'm not sure victory is guaranteed.  You can't project air power if your carriers get hit.  We didn't even discuss their sub program, the rest of their air force, their rail guns which they've apparently successfully tested on ships while I believe we shuttered our own program to focus on hypersonics - which China is also working and and will pose a problem for anyone who doesn't have them on the open sea.

But more importantly, when making claims like ""Austria continued to receive gas"" you should obviously link a source for that claim and this article is too lazy to provide a single link to anything. 

Austria being compromised by Russian spies is actually one of the claims I have less issues with unless it's framed in a misleading way on purpose. What I will say that the focus on *Russian* spies is a dangerous half-truth and those can be more misleading than lies. The presence of foreign secret services in Vienna isn't comparable to other cities and also includes the West and Turkey among others. It's a situation Austria inherited from her history and one I, as a citizen, don't necessarily like because I see it as a danger to Austria's independency. 

That Austria was on (superficially) good terms with Russia is true but the thing is that (especially English-speaking) media leaps from that to ""so obviously they are supporting genocide in Ukraine"" which is mental and only in Russia's interest - their propaganda was always made to demonstrate that Austria is part of ""the east"" and not ""the west"". In reality the Aut-Rus ""friendship"" was driven by a colonial view from Russia over Austria and appeasement from Austria and this war was a deal breaker.

I wouldn't have an issue if the critique about Austria was true, portrayed realistic and by someone who knows what they're talking about but most of the time that's not the case and too often English media even spread propaganda that originated in Russian state media (Austria still buying gas from Russia was one of them, so was Austria blocking sanctions against a Russian oligarch). So I'm just here watching hostility being spread among Europeans because of claims that I know to be false. And most people don't want to listen either, because they have mad up their mind.

>I would have been curious what the population in the east really wanted.

This is easy. From 2005 they were fed Russian propaganda through Russian television which referred them as ""the people of Donbass"". It praised them as the great, strong, self-confident, worthy people that should not be told what to do and approached with great respect. And later the tone changed slightly praising their Russian-leaning traditions, values, cultural links. If only not unfortunate circumstance that they are part of another country called Ukraine, they would have restored their glory and join Russian people just over the fence and live their wealthy life protected by the second army in the world. And when Maidan and Crimea occupation happened the land was already fertile for Russia to organise these sham-referendums.

Edit: but people who fell for this were mixed with people who didn't and saw Russia as a hostile country.

Edit2: In 2010 I was visiting many places which are now occupied (including Bakhmut which was called Artemivsk at the time). I remember one of the local police officers I happened to drink with was asking me ""Why you guys in Kyiv so disrespect us, the people of Donbass. Why do you think we're the lower caste?"". And my reaction was ""What are you talking about dude? What disrespect?"". He's probably dead now.

These numbers have never been credible.  There's not even a possible way Ukraine could know how many russians are dying or being wounded, or dying after being wounded.  With their tank numbers most (85% at one point) have later been confirmed by osint, but that just isn't possible for soldiers.

But saying this number doesn't matter is missing the point.  It probably is the most important number.  As the war drags into a competition to see who can suffer the most deaths without breaking, Ukraine's kill ratio becomes the most important thing.   The war won't end until 500k russians (give or take a factor of 10) have died, and russia is no longer able to support a military.  Military equipment exists partly to negate other equipment, but mostly to improve the deaths ratio.

Although I strongly suspect far more Ukrainian military have died than we know about, the current ""offensive"" doesn't seem to be getting a ""bad"" ratio.   Most of what enables the offensive is a high rate of drone and artillery use to kill from afar.  Trench and minefield clearing are important, but much smaller in scale.

The lives of its people are any democracy's most valuable resource. Ukraine needs more materiel that lets them destroy russian equipment and kill soldiers without suffering deaths themselves.

Sweden is no longer non-aligned or neutral in any practical sense. It has actively applied to join NATO.

Beyond this, Sweden is currently agreeing on a Defense Cooperation Agreement with the US. Whether or not Swedish law *currently* authorizes renting out bases to the US/NATO, it is expected to make the legal changes that remove any obstacles to doing that.

> So I don't see how Sweden could ""get away with"" something similar in their position.

...what exactly do you think is going to stop Sweden? Who is there to oppose it/for them to ""get away with"" anything against? Russia? It has US/UK protection now and Russia's certainly not in much of a position to open another front even if it didn't. Gotland is kind of a moot point anyway when Finland's now in NATO.

But a few things were unexpected.

Austrians, in 2018, well after the invasion of Crimea, viewed Russia more favorably than the USA.

https://www.tt.com/artikel/15068627/cnn-umfrage-russland-in-oesterreich-besser-angeschrieben-als-usa

And 2/3rds of Austrians believe the Ukraine should give up their occupied territory to appease Russia.

>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to sit down at the negotiating table with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Even if this means that territories occupied by Russia must be ceded to the aggressor. In a survey conducted for ""Heute"", 65% of Austrians are in favour of this

https://www.heute.at/s/oesterreicher-wollen-nicht-dass-ukraine-weiterkaempft-100255951

My previous stance was that most the Austrian ambivalence towards Russia was primarily driven by business or government interest, not wider popular support. 

But that article paints a picture of the average Austrian, while viewing the invasion as maybe ""distasteful"", and open to helping with some humanitarian aid, really just wanting to see Ukraine give up now, so things can quickly get back to the lucrative normal.

It actually seems like the current politicians are the ones standing up to Russia, perhaps to their future political detriment, if the polling is correct.

>Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg poured cold water on the idea that peace negotiations could be held any time soon: “Russia is seeking a decision [on the conflict] on the battlefield, and it would be very dangerous to say that Ukraine must relent for the sake of peace and give up certain parts of its territory. For me, it’s clear: there can be no decision about Ukraine without Ukraine.”

So maybe this explains why the Z graffiti marks are showing up in Vienna. Frustrated segment of the population annoyed at Ukrainians for not giving into Russia. And feeling that their politicians are taking a harder line with Russia than they would want, so directing their anger at Ukrainian cars.

I guess I am now a bigger fan of the current Austrian government for actually being more supportive of Ukraine than their population desires.

It praised them as the great, strong, self-confident, worthy people that should not be told what to do and approached with great respect.

If only not unfortunate circumstance that they are part of another country called Ukraine, they would have restored their glory and join Russian people just over the fence and live their wealthy life protected by the second army in the world. And when Maidan and Crimea occupation happened the land was already fertile for Russia to organise these sham-referendums.

So what you're really saying is that what I was saying ""could happen"" has in fact already happened. You're proving my point. If all it takes for a region to switch allegiance is to fed them 5 years of propaganda...then it was an easy to conquer region in the first place.

In the case the front lines remain frozen, I don't see Ukraine opening another war in the future. That is something that Russia could do. But that wouldn't be ""revanchist"", it would be just plain old imperialism, so I am not sure what you mean?

> Mexico is Spanish-speaking. Part of Canada is French-speaking and other part is English-speaking. Austria is German-speaking. Part of Belgium is French-speaking, part is German speaking

There you go, proving my point once again. There was little to no trouble for Germany to annex Austria in 1938. And if the US would have won the 1812 war, I am pretty sure Canada would have integrated quickly in the US(at least the English part), just like Texas and California did a few years later. French Canada is to this day wanting to secede from the English part...

The same with Iraq invading Kuwait, up until the western powers intervened, there was little trouble...they would have integrated in a couple of years.

Contrast that with Russian occupation of Poland for a couple hundred years, or Finland etc.

Ish. At the surface level the answer is no. Firing cluster munitions doesn’t clear minefields by themselves. That said a minefield by itself isn’t actually a significant obstacle.

Minefields slow down the attacker and can force them to bunch up which leads to them getting destroyed by enemy fire or doing something reckless and hitting a mine.

Strawmanning pretty hard today, aren't we.

Look, it's really simple. You orating your cringe nonsense is simply an ego trip. That's you making it about yourself and your feelings. It's a form of self-gratification on a public forum. Fact is, if everyone behaved like you just did this thread would have been completely useless. 

I know you don't want to hear it because you apparently feel a *lot* of need for validation, what being several comments deep defending yourself by looking at fake internet points. But again, that's *your* problem. Maybe learn to understand the world doesn't revolve around you and your feelings. And if your feelings are just a little bit too big for you to handle, do as I said and write them down in a diary.",False,1689019535.0,t3_14vj597,t1_jrfyw11,,2,0,0,0,0,0,
