Key Takeaways February 26

    Russia has failed to encircle and isolate Kyiv with mechanized and airborne attacks as it had clearly planned to do. Russian forces are now engaging in more straightforward mechanized drives into Kyiv along a narrow front on the west bank of the Dnipro River and on a broad front to the northeast.

    Russian forces temporarily abandoned efforts to seize Chernihiv and Kharkiv to the northeast and east of Kyiv and are bypassing those cities to continue their drive on Kyiv. Failed Russian attacks against both cities were poorly designed and executed and encountered more determined and effective resistance than Russia likely expected.

    Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.

    Russian forces in eastern Ukraine remain focused on pinning the large concentration of Ukrainian forces arrayed along the former line of contact in the east, likely to prevent them from interfering with Russian drives on Kyiv and to facilitate their encirclement and destruction.

    Ukrainian forces retook the critical city of Kherson and Russian forces halted their drive on Odesa. Some Russian troops remain west of the Dnipro River and are advancing on Mykolaiv, but the main axes of advance have shifted to the north and east toward Zaporizhie and Mariupol respectively.

    Russian forces have taken the critical city of Berdyansk from the west, threatening to encircle Mariupol with Russian forces in Donbas attacking Mariupol from the east, likely to pin defenders in the city.
    Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.

    The United States, Canada, and European allies removed select Russian banks from the SWIFT global financial network and agreed to additional measures that could significantly increase economic pressure on Russia.

    The United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom facilitated a significant expansion of NATO countries’ lethal aid shipments to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began.

    NATO countries began contributing forces to NATO Response Force (NRF) operations in Eastern Europe, reinforcing NATO’s eastern flank.

    Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is set to displace millions of Ukrainians internally and throughout eastern Europe; at least 150,000 Ukrainians have fled the country as of February 26 as urban fighting intensifies.

Russia does not have some super special reserve of super awesome troops it's gonna send in a day or two after the pleb Russians are done getting killed.

The past three decades have been brutal on the Russian military. They went from a bankrupt, failed communist state to a barely functional oligarchy who's top leaders are bleeding the country dry.

Even if you try to portray the Army as useless, untrained conscripts; the same cannot be said for paratroopers, tankers, and fighter pilots. They tanks tons of training to use their equipment correctly.

You can't take four guys hanging out in bar and put them in a T-90 and expect them to be able to engage enemy units at a mile away. You can't take a hobo off a back alley, strap a parachute on him, drop him behind enemy lines, and expect him to hold an airfield.

Russia's military just isn't what it was 50+ years ago. Decades of poor funding, poor training conditions, and lack of actual combat experience have left it a shadow of itself. In lue of all of those Russia has opted for a propaganda stance to push the idea that their fighting force is the best in the world and that every Russian soldier is an awesome badass ready to do back flips and throw ninja stars.

So let's get this absolutely clear. Russia is not dropping some super awesome troops they've been withholding. Their equipment are a mix of late cold war, early post war era weapons that have been upgraded and are near the end of their sell by dates. Their advantage is numbers and after Ukraine they might not even have that going for them.",False,1645937865.0,t3_t2gb8x,t3_t2gb8x,,0,264,0,264,0,0,

Russian forces are now engaging in more straightforward mechanized drives into Kyiv along a narrow front on the west bank of the Dnipro River and on a broad front to the northeast.

Russian forces temporarily abandoned efforts to seize Chernihiv of Kyiv and are bypassing cities to continue their drive on Kyiv. Failed Russian attacks against cities were poorly designed and executed and encountered more determined and effective resistance than Russia likely expected.

Russian successes in southern Ukraine are the most dangerous and threaten to unhinge Ukraine’s successful defenses and rearguard actions to the north and northeast.

Russian forces in eastern Ukraine remain focused on pinning the large concentration of Ukrainian forces arrayed along the former line of contact in the east, likely to prevent them from interfering with Russian drives on Kyiv and to facilitate their encirclement and destruction.

Ukrainian forces retook the critical city of Kherson and Russian forces halted their drive on Odesa. Some Russian troops remain west of the Dnipro River and are advancing on Mykolaiv, but the main axes of advance have shifted to the north and east toward Zaporizhie and Mariupol respectively.

Russian forces have taken the critical city of Berdyansk from the west, threatening to encircle Mariupol with Russian forces in Donbas attacking Mariupol from the east, likely to pin defenders in the city.

Russian troops are facing growing morale and logistics issues, predictable consequences of the poor planning, coordination, and execution of attacks along Ukraine’s northern border.

**Quick Information Reality Check** 


1) If a politician is broadcasting information it has motives, don't discredit the information just understand the perspective and move on.


2) The US is probably using intelligence leaks to fuck with Putin, there's no way anyone is sharing information without permission.


3) Great example - Airplanes on flight radar are choosing to broadcast their location. It's flexing but not Intel. They are invisible when on attack.


4) This is war. Misinformation is rampant, but you can't just bash facts because of the source being fox or CNN, liberal or conservative.

Russia does not have some super special reserve of super awesome troops it's gonna send in a day or two after the pleb Russians are done getting killed. Russia's army is barely keeping up with first world countries, it's airforce is about to be left in the dust of 5th generation planes and don't have a ton of pilots to begin with, and their Navy is not made to fight a full naval war.

The past three decades have been brutal on the Russian military. They went from a bankrupt, failed communist state to a barely functional oligarchy who's top leaders are bleeding the country dry.

Even if you try to portray the Army as useless, untrained conscripts; the same cannot be said for paratroopers, tankers, and fighter pilots. They tanks tons of training to use their equipment correctly. 


You cannot take a rando off the street, throw him in a SU-30 and expect him to get it off the ground. You can't take four guys hanging out in bar and put them in a T-90 and expect them to be able to engage enemy units at a mile away. You can't take a hobo off a back alley, strap a parachute on him, drop him behind enemy lines, and expect him to hold an airfield.

Russia's military just isn't what it was 50+ years ago. Decades of poor funding, poor training conditions, and lack of actual combat experience have left it a shadow of itself. In lue of all of those Russia has opted for a propaganda stance to push the idea that their fighting force is the best in the world and that every Russian soldier is an awesome badass ready to do back flips and throw ninja stars.

So let's get this absolutely clear. Russia is not dropping some super awesome troops they've been withholding. Their equipment are a mix of late cold war, early post war era weapons that have been upgraded and are near the end of their sell by dates. Their advantage is numbers and after Ukraine they might not even have that going for them.",False,1645938072.0,t3_t2gb8x,t3_t2gb8x,,0,71,0,71,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

Everybody today knows of the Spartans because of Frank Miller's romanticized version of what happened at the Battle of Thermopylae and the resulting movie. That battle created a perception in Greece that the Spartans were badass professionals that would fight to the end rather than surrender. The Spartan leadership capitalized on this and focused their industry and socio-political culture on building this perception of the Spartiate elite, to be feared throughout Greece. Following the war with Persia, the Spartans lived up to their reputation and defeated the Athenians during the Peleponnesian Wars, cementing Greece's perception of the city state and its military. However, at the Battle of Leuctra, the Thebans destroyed this image when they defeated the Spartans with superior tactics and the use of their Sacred Band.   
  
Today we see a similar situation unfolding in Ukraine. The feared Russian military is failing to secure what analysts expected to be an easy victory, and is being destroyed by the tactics and willpower of the Ukrainian people. Furthermore, Russia is failing to abide by common military principles at the tactical and operational level. At the tactical level, we see columns of Russian units on live streams maneuvering down linear danger areas (roads) in column formations, AND not scanning sectors of fire for potential threats. They are failing to disperse and provide local security, leaving them vulnerable to ambushes or massed fires. We see Russian forces surrendering, due to low morale. At the operational level, we see Russian Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs) maneuver in ways that leave them unable to receive resupply. Once contact is made, these BTGs split forces at the Platoon/Company level to fix the resistance, while the remaining forces conduct a bypass to try and get to Kiev. It's why we see Ukrainian forces retaking cities and key terrain that they are pushed out of. They are simply able to disperse under resistance, and mass their forces on the Russians once the rest of the BTG is far behind their lines.  
  
So why is this happening? Corruption and a toxic culture in the Russian military.  
  
We've been seeing reports that Russian conscripts are being forced into becoming contract Soldiers. Conscripts in the Russian Army serve for only 1 year. To preserve institutional knowledge among the enlisted, the Russian military reformed in 2008 to encourage Soldiers to sign service contracts in the same way the U.S. Military does.  
  
These contract service members usually serve as the combat arms component, while conscripts serve as the logistics and support roles.   
Elite units like the VDV are comprised of contract Soldiers, and some units (guards divisions with high concentrations of non-ethnic Russians) have contractors as their NCO Corps only.  
  
Based on the Soldiers captured by UA, and the lack of tactics shown in the Russian offensives, we’re seeing that a lot of these Soldiers are probably conscripts forced into contract service, but why? The easiest answer is that manpower has been attrited before the invasion, and I see the following contributors:  
  
A. The Soldiers committed are of those non-ethnic Russian divisions from the East. Early reports of the composition of forces around Ukraine showed the presence of these Soldiers, deployed there because of the lack of a cultural connection to Ukrainians. However, based on the Slavic appearance of POWs, this is not entirely the case.  
  
B. COVID decimated the manpower of the combat arms components. Most of the disinformation campaigns that hit the United States regarding vaccination were from Russian troll accounts. Information is a double edged sword though because it probably was consumed by the most conservative members of Russian society, the contract servicemen. Reports during the build up indicated that COVID was flowing through the Russian formations due to the poor living conditions they endured.  
  
C. Putin is keeping the bulk of his most experienced Soldiers close by to protect against a coup. The mismanagement of logistics in the Russian military indicate that the staff planning the offensive are not the same staff who planned the 2014 hybrid war. The 2020 poisoning of Navalny cues us on a potential wider political purge in the Kremlin. I suspect Gerasimov was removed due to the praise and recognition he received for execution of the Donbas campaign. He was seen as a political threat in the same way that Hitler saw Rommel as a threat. Putin’s recent behavior indicates paranoia and isolation, supporting the assumption that he’s worried about a coup and therefore keeping forces on standby.  
  
D. The Russian unit commanders in their corruption were probably making their slides green on personnel, so readiness was misrepresented to the Kremlin. When shit hit the fan, they had to make up for the ghosts on their rosters and force conscript Soldiers into contracts.",False,1645940352.0,t3_t2gb8x,t3_t2gb8x,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

Russian troops have entered Kharkiv in Ukraine’s north-east, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister and other officials have said. It is the country’s second-largest city.

In a statement on his official Telegram account, Anton Gerashchenko said there was fighting in the centre of the city and in the area of the Hydropark.

“A group of special forces of the Russian Federation has just burst into the city through Alekseevka. On the street,” Gerashchenko said.

Oleg Sinegubov, the chairman of the Kharkiv regional state administration, announced “there has been a breakthrough in light equipment including in the central part of the city”, according to the Kyiv Independent. He urged local residents to remain in shelters.

Olga Tokariuk, a freelance correspondent in Kyiv, posted a video of a burning tank in a location purported to be Kharkiv to her Twitter this morning.

Snake Island men might be alive!  (We know this is propaganda because Russia prop sources started the rumor -the Ukrainian National Guard thing is likely a very clever fake) 

Thermboric weapons are the DEVIL:  They are terrible but tactically not great, they just work to scare everyone.  Putin can't win this by committing rampant atrocities.  He needs China and Saudi and India to stay on his side.  The stuff about them is Russian propaganda to panic Ukrainians.  

They sent in the Old stuff first as a fake out of some kind.  In reality,  they sent the old stuff becausethe new stuff uses too much gas. They dont have the logistics to support the T-14 tanks driving around in Ukraine without already having secured the roads in Ukraine for tanker truck convoys. Plus, the new tanks are only useful against US tanks - they will still blow up when shot by a Javelin or a Nlaw or a jet. In the new ones maybe the crew survives. Putin doesn't care. They dont blow up civilian buildings any better than old tanks.

Kyviv is a clever feint to draw off Ukrainian troops and the real strategy is to take over just the Donblas.  The intent is clearly to take Kyviv, but just the Donblas or as much of east Ukraine as they can get may be the back up plan.  They think the world will accept a divided Ukraine and barter sanctions relief for stopping the war.  Unfortunately for Russia, it isn't going to go the way they hope. The line of contact will just move from where it was in Donbas to wherever the Russians are finally forced to declare victory - because they can't go on.  Russia will then occupy Ukrainian territory and be put under crushing sanctions until they leave.

> Building Strongpoints
> 
> If choosing an area defense, which focuses on terrain, or assigning subordinate units to use perimeter defense of key terrain in the urban area, a strong tactic is to create strongpoints by reinforcing buildings or using preexisting structures that are already hard to destroy—for example, heavy-clad concrete structures like government buildings, apartments, and office complexes or banks. These strongpoint buildings become mini-fortresses within the city. If the defending force has the time and the engineer support it can bring in sandbags, lumber, steel girders, and other strengthening materials to harden the structure and create numerous bunkers within the fortress. Mines, wire, and other materials should be used to create obstacles around the building and seal any possible entryways, all to make it difficult for the enemy, who will require an abundance of time, fires, and resources to approach and clear the position. The critical analysis is choosing the right buildings to strongpoint, establishing multiple angles of attack by fire from the building, and constructing an obstacle network that prevents the attacker from simply bypassing or isolating the building to clear later.
> 
> 
> Rubbling Buildings
> 
> Urban defenders must shape the terrain to facilitate their obstacles, engagement areas, ambushes, and battle positions. The sheer amount of military grade fortification material (e.g., concrete) gives an urban defender a great advantage. Some of the main goals of an urban defense are to funnel attacking forces into engagement areas, canalize them down a small number of avenues of approach, and constrain their ability to maneuver and mass forces. A method to accomplish this—and it is understood to be controversial, given the amount of destruction it generates—is to create rubble by destroying structures to produce broken concrete, rebar, stones, bricks, or solid material to include debris. Rubbled buildings can occur in urban warfare from an attacker’s preparatory fires (aerial bombing, artillery, and mortars) but they can also be created purposely by defenders to block avenues of approach by partially or completely destroying buildings using demolitions and fires or simply moving existing rubble.
> 
> 
> Concrete Barriers
> 
> Modern cities often have existing concrete barriers for vehicle checkpoints or infrastructure protection. These barriers offer ready-made field fortifications. Concrete reinforced with steel rebar is an extremely difficult obstacle to reduce in combat. Concrete barriers can range in size from three-foot-tall, two-ton vehicle barriers used across the world to twelve-foot-tall, six-ton wall segments used by the United States and other militaries in Iraq and Afghanistan.
> 
> 
> Interior Building Heavy Weapon Systems Positions
> 
> Defenders must maximize and protect their critical capabilities. Large weapons can be disassembled and reassembled on the higher floor of a building to provide superior lines of sight and angles of fire. This also creates bunker-like protection to the defender’s most casualty-producing weapons.
> 
> 
> Wood, Tin, Tarpaulins or Cloth Sheet Coverings
> 
> In the contemporary operational environment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to remain concealed or to conduct deception operations due to the proliferation of aerial reconnaissance assets. Urban defenders must now develop creative ways to hide obstacles, weapon systems, battle positions, and personnel from aerial observation or they will easily be destroyed long before the attacker reaches the main battle area.
> 
> 
> Mouseholes and Tunnels
> 
> Streets and alleyways in urban warfare can become death traps for both attackers and defenders. The defenders should seek to remain hidden before and during their operation to increase their survivability. The tactic of using mouseholes—holes created in interior and exterior walls of buildings that allow soldiers to move through the exterior walls and interior spaces of buildings—is without question one of the most dominant recurring defense techniques found in urban warfare history. Holes can be made manually with sledgehammers and other tools or with explosives. Tunnels and subterranean spaces can be created between battle positions and when there is an existing underground network, it should be maximized for force protection and mobility.
> 
> 
> Caches
> 
> The defense allows a force to pre-position ammunition, medical supplies, water, and rations. Urban terrain provides great advantages for hidden, protected, and concealed pre-positioned supply points to support multiple primary, alternate, and supplementary battle positions. Attacking forces have the major disadvantage because they are forced to bring their resources forward with vehicles or dismounted personnel and require resources to protect lines of communications to support resupply traffic.
> 
> 
> Rapidly Emplaced Hasty Obstacles
> 
> The urban environment offers a multitude of large objects that allow defending forces the ability to create obstacles both inside and outside of buildings. Vehicles can be repositioned to block streets, furniture can be thrown into staircases, and concertina wire and remotely detonated explosive devices can be added to hinder easy movement between floors and into entryways of buildings. Concrete barriers, cars, buses, construction vehicles, dumpsters, furniture, and tires can be moved into streets and flipped over to channel, divert, or halt enemy armored fighting vehicles or dismounted personnel.
> 
> 
> Hit-and-Run, Antiarmor Ambushes
> 
> If the enemy chooses a single axis of advance or if the terrain and defense plan successfully channel the attacker down main roads, the use of mobile antiarmor ambushes has historically shown great success. The use of both static and mobile positions with clear engagement and disengagement criteria only strengthens an urban defense scheme of maneuver. Small, lightweight, lethal, hit-and-run teams armed with antitank weapons can achieve momentum-stopping effects on enemy forces and attrit attacking forces while the defenders continue to draw them into their main defensive area.
> 
> 
> Snipers
> 
> Snipers are a force multiplier while conducting a defense. The urban environment offers snipers and even minimally trained marksmen thousands of protected hide sites and concealed firing lines, including through multiple buildings. Snipers throughout the history of urban warfare have been a dominating feature due to their ability to cause extreme havoc on attacking forces in urban terrain.

Ukraine is better supplied every day with massive economic and military support from the west which will only increase unless Russia can cut it off. They are clearly still going for Kyiv to attempt political capitulation and a puppet government. However I really don’t see how they have a hope in hell of holding on in the medium to long term.

I think they will attempt to continue to assault major cities and keep Ukrainian forces pinned. So why keep going. It’s not just cos Putin is nuts. Russia wants a defensible and short land bridge between Crimea and Donbas. This gives them the ability to supply Crimea and exploit the Black Sea resources. If they can’t take eastern Ukraine they will continue to destroy any infrastructure that threatens Russia‘s place as Europe’s monopolistic Petrostate. Unfortunately this is all down to money, fossil fuels and reducing the land border Russia needs to defend in case of western aggression. Clearly Putin is stuck in his KGB days and yearning for a Russia Empire and the Oligarchs and him will keep throwing men and equipment into the meat grinder. Meanwhile both Russian and Ukrainian civilians bear the brunt. 
Putin survives this debacle at least until after the above. Then even if he falls out a window, the wealthy in Russia can start “anew”. Fuck Putin. Fuck the Oligarchs. Fuck crony capitalism. Fuck the oil-military-industrial complex.

-Dwight D. Eisenhower

I keep hearing people that EU nations should greatly increase military spending and that the U.S. should give billions of dollars to Ukraine without hesitation, but I am sitting here wondering why everybody is so Willy nilly when it comes to billions of dollars. I am very sympathetic to the plight of the Ukrainian people, but I hope that everybody remembers that every dollar you spend on weapons is a dollar that could have gone to feeding your hungry, housing your homeless, or educating your children. Yes, arms spending is necessary, but one should never forget the opportunity costs it takes.

For every piece of armament our country buys (and gifts to Ukraine) is another American that we continue to condemn to poverty.

For 6.4 billion dollars how many people can we feed? How many people can we house? How many of our best and brightest can we send to college who might not otherwise have the chance due to finances?

American foreign policy has already cost us over 5 trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Isn’t time to focus on the vulnerable and downtrodden Americans first for a change?",False,1645938484.0,t3_t2gb8x,t3_t2gb8x,,0,-35,0,-35,0,0,

Most of Russia's military gets very minimal yearly training. Special Forces are good, everyone else is ""meh"". So we are seeing lots of ""meh"" soldiers. This shows up in all sorts of ways, inability to navigate well, not coordinating in big groups well, and actual fighting poorly.

There was some systemic intelligence failures in Russia which meant they prepared for the wrong kind of war. Also, indications of systemic blindspots in their intelligence (""everyone knows Ukraine will fold"" or ""our forces are in good shape."")

Namely, they don't seem to have prepared their supply chain. They also did not prepare an overall command structure; this hinders inter-branch coordination (army can't call in an airstrike, basically).

I thought weeks ago when the declass intel was coming out that at some point it must have been a deception move being used for negotiating leverage, had to be because why else would you possibly think this was a good idea. Just take a step back and realize the glaring military issues. 

1st. Russia intent is to annex a country, which needs to be in working order so this takes out the possibility of softening air defense encampments/transportation/critical infrastructure, along with the fact that using heavy means like long range artillery will create the exact kind of global backlash you knew you had to avoid from the start.

 2nd. if all of the declass intel was spot on... then we obviously know a hell of a lot more and you really should stop all together. Consider how high of a source this has to be to basically be reading your invasion plans. 

3rd. Just from a military standpoint... You have done this once in Afghanistan... Why did you ever think getting involved in and creating an insurgency would be a good idea. You saw what some mujahideen were able to do at your height. This an actual army using the same equipment with exponentially higher volume on the same vehicles you used in Afghanistan.

So it seems everyone horribly overestimated Russian capabilities and underestimated Ukrainian ones. The failed air drop in the opening day at the airport north of Kiev was the clearest sign. Paratroops must be relieved or they will be wiped out. The fact that they were dropped there tells you the Russians expected their north western troops to relieve them in hours. They were not, and they were wiped out as a fighting force.

Future conflict remains likely and possibly guaranteed if/when Ukraine seeks future security guarantees with the EU, NATO, or multi-lateral defensive agreements with other states outside of the EU/NATO frameworks.
2. Ukraine and Russia agree to a negotiated peace that sees the return of Donbas to Ukraine in some form (e.g. Russia withdraws support for separatists and leaves them to their own devices). Crimea, too, maybe but with some sort of 99-year lease agreement to Russia. Ukraine also agrees to be Finlandised. Probability of it happening? Maybe in the realm of pure fantasy.

Ultimately, no one can say what would constitute a ""feasible"" victory. Survival at the very least, yes, but the minimum conditions for that won't lay a foundation for lasting peace. Either Russia or Ukraine will have to make a big compromise somewhere and for Ukraine, at least, that compromise would be its hard-fought sovereignty.",False,1645941948.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hym0q7a,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Now to the Ukrainians - yes, these people are an absolute inspiration. This war is a historic event and I think the entire western world will be better for what these people are doing. I don't think it can be over stated.",1645939331.0,1645939010.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hylx2sd,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Before the fighting started I would have said no way Ukraine wins the conventional war, at this point they have a not insignificant chance of it.

Russia planned around Ukraine pretty much rolling over. Instead they have been meeting fierce resistance which has made a weak supply situation critical. If Russia can't achieve a breakthrough soon they will have to consolidate and regroup. But that means they will have lost significant amounts of men and material to little or no gain. Sanctions will be crippling their economy as time goes on. Ukraine will get resupplied by the West and Ukraine will have time to prepare more defenses (and train more troops.)

Russia has been making baffling decisions. They failed to knock out Ukraine's air force and air defenses and haven't been able to maintain air supremacy. (They typically have contested air superiority.) And because of this they seem to keep taking losses to helicopters, air transports, and planes. We keep seeing Russia have unit's get isolated and defeated in detail in what has been an uncoordinated mess.

There aren't many good invasion routes because of the mud (it didn't freeze how Russia needed it too.) So they have been advancing along the roads, which makes them easier to ambush. And Ukraine has been focusing on supply convoys instead of the forward units it seems. The road issue has also limited how fast Russia can move more troops in.

shorter supply lines, detailed knowledge of local terrain, civil resistance, large number of volunteers for militia units, determined and charismatic leadership, unexpected large 'gifts' of huge amounts of military equipment and hardware and any number of others I can't think of.

Putin's Russia on paper should have just been able to steamroll in and set up shop, but they seem to have run into innumerable issues despite having advantages like:
seemingly low troop morale, highly questionable reason for invasion, green untested troops being used to spearhead the invasion, old and out dated military equipment (in some cases), much longer supply lines, extremely uncooperative and potentially hostile Ukrainian population, dogged resistance by Ukranian military, discontent in his own population about the war, unexpectedly large international backlash leading to the effective isolation diplomatically and starting to economically.

Like you I too was surprised by the courage and determination being shown by the people of Ukraine to defend their families, homes and country.  They have everything to fight for, because they everything to lose.  The Putin's Russian military has entered a country they may eventually occupy but is highly doubtful they will ever control.  They would be in territory that could contain upward of 40 million potentially hostile people that outnumber them even unarmed significantly.

When this is all over and historians are picking through the threads of the conflict I'll guess we'll have a clearer picture of why things are happening as they are.  At the moment with out all the information we can only guess and make assumptions (educated ones I hope).

The green tinted night vision video with tracer fire lighting up the sky and various explosions is something I will never forget. This was very early days of the Internet (dial up connections) so broadcast cable TV was really the only way to see what was going on.

This current conflict does seem different though because it involves a non US super power invading a democratically elected country without any provocation other than existing plus its in Easter Europe and I think a lot of people see comparisons to how of WW2 started accept this time the one starting the conflict has nukes. Interesting times ahead.

fa1f13d16a716ed3399cb2882703f576,t2gb8x,hym5pwb,"Dude go look into Italian citizenship. Depending on how far back you might have a good claim. 

Very basically - if your direct ancestor was a citizen in 1948 or after, male or female, then you can claim citizenship. If they were only citizens before 1948 (i.e. moved to the US, had kids who were born in the US) then it has to come through your paternal line up until 1948.  This is because the law changed to allow women to pass on citizenship as well starting in 1948. There is no generational limit to pass on Italian citizenship. 

So say ancestor A is a male with Italian citizenship moved in 1900. He has a son in 1910, ancestor B, who also has a son in 1930, ancestor C, and ancestor C had ancestor D, who can be any gender, during or after 1948 - then you get citizenship. Ancestors A-C had to be male, but ancestor D could be male or female. 

There are some trip ups that might have happened (becoming a US citizen used to require abandoning your old citizenship claims in other countries; however, in the hypothetical above, if ancestor A had ancestor B before he became ancestor A became naturalized citizen - something that was very, very common as we didn't have the same stringent immigration system - then the Italian citizenship would still have passed on through the generations, as ancestor B would have been granted it at birth).",False,1645943669.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hym4e8p,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

That means the shit is about to hit the fan in Russia.

The shitty part about that, though is that it doesn’t necessarily mean for the better.  They are still people, and they will need help.

It is, quite literally, sending in troops to fight and likely die to gradually gain a strategic position or advantage while you also soften the target.

But the general idea is that you actually gain something from the deaths of the cannon fodder.

Look at the Ukrainians. They have thousands of militia: just average Joes and Janes who picked up an AK-47 yesterday with no military training. The very definition of ""cannon-fodder"" units. No one expects these people to move or shoot accurately.

How are the Ukrainians actually using these people? They're staying home, close to their neighborhoods where they have grossly more knowledge than the invaders. They're coordinating with the military in neighborhood fireteams. And finally, the Ukrainian military has the weapons that would immediately end the fight against any heavy weapons as the ""cannon fodder"" militia are there defending their homes.

Guess what? You _DON'T_ just sacrifice your soldiers (or even shitty volunteer / untrained militia riflemen). You try to maximize the value of _EVERY_ life that has dedicated itself to the cause. When those inaccurate militia are shooting at tanks (or other invaders), the Ukrainian military will have the time to swoop in with ""Saint Javelin"" and end the fight.

That's the thing. These shitty Ukrainian neighborhood militia units who picked up a rifle yesterday are already contributing to the war in more meaningful ways than fucking trained Russian soldiers. Thats just fucking sad.

------

its called a force multiplier. When you have 50 militia shooting inaccurately at you + 5 soldiers hiding in a random-building with a NLAW / Javalin / anti-tank missile, those 50-militia are meaningfully contributing to the success of the operation. Even if they missed 100% of their shots and wasted all their ammo... they better contributed than just running in and dying like these sad, poor, Russians.",1645944334.0,1645944080.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hym59o5,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

US and pals quickly established complete air superiority by neutralising Iraq's air force AND primary surface-based air defenses. Their attack aircraft could then carry out continuous strikes and close air support without fear of being repelled by the more threatening SAM's or fighter craft. 

Russia hasn't had that luxury. Their forces are far more numerous but there isn't a significant technogical superiority. It's likely by now that Ukraine's air force is wiped out or laying low, but their air defenses are fairly modernised thanks to NATO supply and training.

A column of tanks, therefore, is an ideal target for anti tank missiles - their turrets won't be pointig in the right direction for defense, and the softer armor of the tank is on its sides. It also means that the attacker is more likely to damage the tanks treads and visual equipment. A classic anti tank sortie is to wait for a few of the vehicles at the front of a column to pass by while your soldiers hide, then ambush them once you have an easy line of sight for the middle of the column.

So you're basically looking at this wrong. Any _SANE_ commander would have first surrounded Kyiv. Established a perimeter (so that your forces have a way to safely retreat if they encounter fighters in the city), and THEN go in. Instead, we have a bunch of idiot soldiers waltzing in like its going to be easy, and then those Russians get surrounded, captured, or worse.

Furthermore, encircling the city before attacking means that the fighters inside have no where to run, and can't be supplied either.

And if they keep pushing Ukraine to join NATO that Russia is going to attack. And if Russia attacks it’s going to be bad and Ukraine will get steamrolled. 

Basically, the professor sounds like a Russian spewing talking points. He says that our diplomacy is all wrong and we need to leave China and Russia be. 

https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4

He’s accurate and yet 100% wrong. At the start of the lecture he even says that he feels more at home in China because the Chinese love him so much (for criticizing US foreign policy and supporting China and Russia).

Suddenly the backyard of their house got invaded by Ukrainian tank. The tank crew was very young. Obviously the tank crew wanted to slaughter all of the house inhabitants, including the baker, grandma, and granddaughter. Then a lot of crying and boot-kissing was involved not to get killed. During deep nighttime they decide to flee. They also take their cow. Cow hoofs are covered with rags to muffle the sound. Cow is asked not to defecate. If the cow defecates, they would be heard and killed. Cow understands what it is asked to do and cries with heavy tears. Cow does not defecate. The family succeeds in fleeing the occupied house, with the crying cow. A lot of people witnessed that and can prove what I am saying. This is horrible. Why, oh god, why!

Several reasons for this. Russia just has overwhelming numbers but are facing fierce fighters, so it makes sense to send the cannon fodder first, before your better soldiers (as crass as that is to say).

However Russia has so far, for unknown reasons, stuck to the roads in Ukraine. They aren’t plowing through the countryside, and the roads are a natural bottleneck — you can only put so many vehicles on the roads in.

There is zero doubt that Russia is holding huge numbers of troops at the ready.

Edit: To talk more about numbers, Russia hasn’t readied all of its forces either. They have 1MM active duty troops, plus 2MM in reserve. Compare that to Ukraine’s 450k combined active and reserve. However, Ukraine has 7MM untrained but fit for combat men, and roughly an equal number of women, a significant portion of whom are willing to defend their country. Russia can’t match *those* numbers without sending untrained soldiers, but they don’t necessarily have to. One trained soldier is worth several untrained militiamen.",1645942200.0,1645941799.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hym29q0,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

What it means is, the Russian commanders have been told / forced to attack with all of their might. For whatever strategic reason, Russia wants to finish this whole war very quickly, even at great risk to their troops and military.

Russia may even just want Zelenskyy dead, just so that they have some kind of event that they can call a ""victory"" for themselves and their military. So the commanders on the ground are going for ""Hail Mary"" attempts to kinda-sorta-maybe get the guy. (IE: commanders know its a low chance to get Zelenskyy at great risk to their troops, but they wanted to try anyway).

I don't know for sure. But... Russians ""need a victory"". Enough so that it might make strategic sense lose some troops over these highly risky attempts. Its important to remember that these troops were trying to do something when they marched into Kyiv.

Those soldiers are dead now, so we don't know what they were planning to do. We just have to guess at it based off of the conditions on the ground.",1645943272.0,1645943002.0,t3_t2gb8x,t1_hym49y0,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

If you're relying on withdrawing from a foreign account (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, for example) *via* a Russian bank/ATM then it gets complicated. The value of the Ruble may also be volatile come next week, meaning 1RUB might buy less than it normally would. I expect regardless what happens the Russian government would manage their exchange rate or artificially fix their exchange rate. Prices would still be impacted though.

I can only say that if I were in your position, I'd get my hands on enough cash to make it through a week or two at very least just in case. If you can access physical USD, Euros, or GBP that also would be helpful to have on hand because they are a stable store of wealth that would be *highly* desirable in the case of rapid inflation or Ruble devaluation. You may be about to get a very personal lesson in economics.
