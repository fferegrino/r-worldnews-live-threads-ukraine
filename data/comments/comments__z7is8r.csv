>Over the last three months, Russian forces in Ukraine have likely largely stopped deploying as Battalion Tactical Groups (BTGs).

>The BTG concept has played a major part in Russian military doctrine for the last ten years, and saw battalions integrated with a full range of supporting sub-units, including armour, reconnaissance and (in a departure from usual Western practice) artillery.

>Several intrinsic weaknesses of the BTG concept have been exposed in the high intensity, large-scale combat of the Ukraine war so far. BTGs’ relatively small allocation of combat infantry has often proved insufficient.

>Decentralised distribution of artillery has not allowed Russia to fully leverage its advantage in numbers of guns; and few BTG commanders have been empowered to flexibly exploit opportunities in the way the BTG model was designed to promote.

Day 279 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today turned out to be a relatively quiet day, though there were some missile launches from Belgorod around 10pm, which were aimed at Kupiansk as usual. They shell that town so much now, there are basically no days when it doesn’t get shelled or hit by missiles. And they hit useless targets like schools, which is extremely stupid because that’s what they were targeting in Kharkiv as well, and they never hit anything military related.

We were expecting the big missile strike to happen today, but it didn’t. A couple of times we did think that it was about to start, but nothing happened. Their strategic bombers did take off from their air bases and they were flying in our direction/close to our borders for about 4 hours straight, but they didn’t fire any missiles. It will still most likely happen in the coming days, but we don’t know when exactly.

The blackouts in Kharkiv and other cities continue, and it looks like 5-6 hours with no electricity per day is the new normal, our governor said pretty much just that today, that they can’t do the previous 3 hours long blackouts anymore and they will be doubled now. Though for some people it’s not even 5-6 hours long blackouts, but more like 12 hours. Some people are without electricity from about 9-10am to 10-11pm, or even longer depending on their location. And in Lviv they will have two 8 hours long blackouts every day, with 6 hours of electricity in between them, which just sounds horrible.

Hey, SaberFlux, thank you for all your reporting.

Electrical engineering is a complicated thing.  There's a lot more to play than meets the eye when it comes to electrical grids.

That said, one of the more impressive things about what you and your countrymen have been accomplishing have been electrical grid repairs and reintegration.  That's been a source of awe for electrical companies and contractors world-wide.


From what I've seen so far, I'm confident that while it is unfair that others may not have downtime, yours and the others who experience their blackouts are necessary because of parity and cohesion for your specific part of the grid that you occupy, as well as others that may be isolated due to reasons that are not obvious.

I'm an also confident that the engineers who are overseeing the repairs will be sought after, on a global scale, once this is behind us because of the expertise they have demonstrated and the experiences they have had.  They are Thor.

Don't worry about temporary relocation if you need to do so - just do it.  Your security comes first.  You're living in a country that was invaded and is at war.",1669721954.0,1669696065.0,t3_z7is8r,t3_z7is8r,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

Why I'm writing this? Later on in the articles there is a description how to Ukraine is pushing back with MT-LBs and even on foot.


There is one small issue. Ukraine is not pushing. And not with MTLB or BTR-82A. The article is describing Russian situation. After some research it looks like 155th is pushing north of Bakhmut, Wagner is pushing to the south and mobiks are in the trenches 200-300m from Bakhmut. There are some nice artillery work videos from today how good that offensive goes. 

Yes looks like this is it. The big push. Ukraine is using old antitank missiles to destroy observation posts. Today they caught 43 years old infantry commander. From his platoon 5 people were left. 3 AK-74s. No grenades, no ammo. Their IFVs destroyed. They don't have recon or communication. There is a video of another IFV that went on a mine.

It should have been clear from about day 3, that the only loss Putin will accept is if NATO steps in. I'm not saying a no-fly zone, or attacks on Russian soil, or even NATO boots on the front lines. But some kind of declaration that Ukraine will have a special status and path into NATO, coupled with say, a peacekeeping styled mission to send troops into major cities to restore infrastructure and resume training. Would the be under threat? Would that ""escalate""? No, and I think we would see immediate halt to missile/drone strikes if there was risk that NATO troops would be hit.

This would give Putin the opportunity to play narrative he has been preparing Russia for since the start. The only way this ends with him possibly holding power. He can withdraw while playing ""the bigger nation"", holding world peace together. And what would change?

Problem: ""But that would drag NATO into a war that would obviously then go nuclear.""

Refutation: Russia doesn't have the ability to effectively target NATO, whether planes or SAM sites or airbases with conventional weapons. So why would they not go nuclear? For the same reason they haven't already gone nuclear. All the NATO intervention would do is protect Ukrainian civilian targets. If having those targets protected = nuclear war, then by that logic, we also can't give Ukraine SAMS, but we already are. I'm not talking about shooting down manned Russian fighters, only unmanned missiles and drones. This shouldn't be a problem, however, since Russia already isn't flying manned missions deep in Ukranian airspace. Therefore, effectively protecting western Ukrainian airspace is not an escalation, only effectively doing something we've already said we're committed to doing. Besides, Russia gave North Korea and North Vietnam everything, fighters and SAMS to use against the USA and that didn't mean the USA retaliated against Russia.

Conclusion: I do not understand why we are letting Russia set red lines for us that they do not have the power to enforce.",1669758535.0,1669758321.0,t3_z7is8r,t3_z7is8r,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Right now battlefield conditions are awful due to the muddy weather, so Ukraine is likely coordinating their forces in such a way as to focus on defense and smaller offensive pushes where possible while Russia throws their hordes into the meat-grinder. It’s horrible to watch and excruciatingly slow for Ukraine but their command has consistently shown us a respect for patience and striking when most appropriate.

My guess is that Ukraine’s command is waiting for the colder weather to set in. Plenty of people keep expecting this winter to be a period of static lines but as the cold sets in, Russian troops will be even more weakened by their poor logistics, especially in their furthest points of occupation in southern Ukraine. Russians are stuck on the front, seeing little to no rotation, while Ukraine will have plenty of forces that they can maneuver and bring to the front fresh, well-supplied, and potentially even freshly trained from some of these joint-National trainings in the UK. In addition, the ground will slowly begin hardening and allowing armor to push forward again. Russia has been building substantial fortifications, but even a push like what was seen in the Kharkiv rout would likely be able to maneuver quite effectively deep into enemy territory should Ukraine see a moment of weakness.",False,1669736183.0,t3_z7is8r,t1_iy7cjud,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

My dad had me buy a bottle of vodka and instructed me to hand it to the police chief handling the case when I see him, as a thank you. And so I did, when he handed me the stamped paper -- I remember he made some effort politely expressing reluctance at receiving the ""gift"", but it was very much like ""oh, gee, thanks, another bottle of vodka"". Basically, he acknowledged the tradition, while doing his earnest ""I am not the most corrupt officer here, but whatever"" impression. He then walked to a closet and stashed the bottle inside it. I managed to get a glimpse of what was in the closet -- a lot of other ""gifts"", with a substantial number of bottles of alcoholic beverage among them, if memory serves right.

Also, I suppose there is a good reason my dad -- beside the ""tradition"" -- asked me to gift the officer a bottle of vodka -- he must have arranged for some expedited processing of the case and I recall he, in advance of my meeting up at the station, told me to basically knock on the office door, tell them who I was etc. Because when I arrived there, there were about a _hundred_ people waiting all over the general premises, in corridors, from the looks of them they had been there for quite some time some of them. Lot of people who looked like daylabourers with temporary work permits -- the kind that don't have the means normally to bribe officials, and have to wait half a day to be received for processing of some required documents like visa, passport renewal, work permit etc. Only later I realized my case basically was put on top of a list because bribery/nepotism of sorts were involved. I remember I felt bad about it already going back from the police station. Not to mention the discomfort I must have felt squeezing through the line to simply walk into the chief's office past the mere mortals unable to unwilling to bribe the office in advance.",1669821710.0,1669715789.0,t3_z7is8r,t1_iy7hbda,,1,31,0,31,0,0,

Ukraine has the manpower by itself. At least, there is no sign that Russia is about to overwhelm them in any way. Adding NATO troops might sound superfluous. And deploying NATO troops means that those troops will not be somewhere else. That wouldn't be a wise strategical move.

In my opinion, what Ukraine needs the most is, put simply, guns. They need all sort of things and things that can help them restart/maintain own production of guns/shell/ammo/planes?

F-35 can't carry a lot of missiles if they want to be in low-observable mode (internal stores only).

The S-400 is the Russian's most advanced anti-air missile system. Estimations state that the radar can track the F-35 but only until it flies within 20 miles of the system. The F-35 would win this standoff with existing weapons and anti-radiation weapons. Instead of tracking the F-35 the S-400 would then need to switch to targeting the anti-radiation missile. All of this happening very quickly. While being pounded by jamming. Also, the F-35 has the capability to launch drones to emulate other planes to further confuse the system. 

The biggest issue with the S-400 is it's field of view is limited to the horizon if not networked with other systems. 

Anti-air is not perfect and is similar to any security system. It requires layers of systems to minimize threats. The S-400 needs multiple bands of radar to detect stealth fighters. It would further need other assets like the PANTSIR system to help back it up in certain areas. 

A lot of electronics, radar systems, missile systems, and manpower is needed to set this up and monitor a particular area.

If you don't remember what happened, a group of boys and their coach got trapped in a flooded cave and everyone was debating how to rescue them. Musk sent some of the SpaceX and Tesla engineers and wanted to try expensive engineering solutions that weren't guaranteed to work or be available in time, like drilling into the cave, pumping out the water, or building a robotic submersible. Instead, Thailand used experience cave divers to get the trapped people out. That resulted in Musk calling the person who organized the divers a pedo and launching a harassment campaign against him. Musk later apologized, but he showed his real face then. 

I've not been surprised by any of Musk's assholery since. Occasionally, he shocks me with how low he goes, but I learned he was a narcissistic asshole during that incident.

So first Kutchma scrapped and sold off most of our strategic bombers, along with long range missiles to Russia. (fuck him sideways). Then fucking Yuschenko decided to ""warm relationships"" with NATO and USA, and follow NATO guideline to ""optimize army"" and destroyed the rest of them following the deal with USA.

You want to hear a funny story? USA reportedly pushed and tried to destroy our Point-U rockets as well. And they carried initial stage of the war and allowed us to survive and strike Russian columns.

McCarthy is promising all of this stupid stuff because the Republican majority is going to be, at most, 5 seats. Maybe only 4, depending on how that final House seat in CA comes out - and the current margin between candidates is less than 600 votes.

He needs the votes from the Qanon caucus to get the position. He will promise all kinds of stupid things to get their vote, then either find reasons not to do them, or do a half-assed job of it.

While he might be able to prevent legislation for funding Ukraine to come up for vote, he can also watch every single bill he *wants* to have passed be defeated. Even if he does get bills passed, they have to go to the Senate, who can amend it and send it back, or let it die in committee, or also defeat it.

It's not that they're infiltrated always, but there's a curious interest Republicans have with authoritarian figures and strong-men leaders. Fox has relentlessly pushed pro-Putin line for years while we come to find that the Kremlin was simultaneously urging its own state media RT to push as many Tucker Carlson clips as possible.

We find that the NRA was laundering money on behalf of Russians, that Republicans were receiving Russian money, that folks like Flynn and Manafort were routinely in conversation with Russians. We find very strange meetings with Republican representatives flying to Moscow to have closed-door meetings, and the likes of Rand Paul hand-delivering letters on behalf of the President to Putin. We had John Bolton himself who even recognized how far the past administration was going and he blew the whistle that he wanted to withdraw from NATO, presumably at the clear behest of Putin's interests. This extends far beyond tinfoil hat conspiracies and just becomes conspiracy.

Regardless, no matter how one slices it it's not a good sign for Ukrainian people who need the help. I believe the widespread sentiment here on these forums is that it's important to stand by Ukraine. After all, we're already seeing Republicans try to weasel their way into a wedge-driving position to undermine that, albeit cautiously.

""I'm taking the kids to a school"" means you are taking them somewhere new that they haven't been before. 

""I'm taking the kids to the school"" tells me they probably haven't been there before, but I'm supposed to know which school you mean (maybe because we discussed it earlier, or because it's the only school in the area).

""I'm taking the kids to school"" means the usual school that they always go to. 

Primarily we use the difference between ""a"" and ""the"" to convey new or old information respectively. Without articles, I would have to use a phrase like ""the one I was telling you about"". 

""There's good school in my town. I like teachers there and education is really good. Although, honestly education is good everywhere in our country. I went to school in the 90s and it was great.""

Now in English we'd put ""a"" before the first use of school, and ""the"" before the second use to indicate that we're talking about the same school. Without articles, it's not clear that I'm talking about the same school - in fact, with some filler in between, it now sounds like I'm talking about a different school. 

Or take another conversation without articles:

- ""I like school in my town""
- ""oh, do they have a great education system?""
- ""no, I like place, building, there are good teachers""
- ""oh, is it better than other schools in your town?""
- ""there's only one school there""

It’s not abnormal to want to find ways to work with them, and we’ll likely find ways to work with them after this is over and Putin is gone.

Let me ask you, in all the Russia gate conspiracy dreams we’ve gone through since the Trump admin, how many elected politicians have served jail time for what they did?  If there was widespread collusion with the Russians there would be a way to use the tremendous resources of the federal government to bring them to justice.  Instead we see a bunch of bit players convicted of lying to investigators and financial crimes getting sentenced.

I’m not doubting that Russians meddled and have funded politicians in some form or fashion, run troll farm campaigns, provided Intel to republicans.  These are all likely true or proven already.  

My doubt is that Republicans are en masse colluding with Russia.  This would require some 4D chess level coverup and frankly many of the Republicans are some of the most hawkish politicians.  and certainly asking questions about funding and offering an opposing viewpoint to an otherwise unchecked federal government is the main function of Congress and we shouldn’t assume it means foreign meddling is involved.

NATO announces that, in response to the war crime of bombing of civilian infrastructure, it will impose a no-fly zone over all of Ukraine. It will shoot down missiles/airplanes, and attack any ground artillery from either side targeting civilian infrastructure.

Small enough to likely avoid nuclear escalation. Large enough for Putin to say ""we lose because NATO got involved"" and save some face/create some grievance.

The UN, along with NATO and Ukraine all at the same time, announces that if Russia withdraws from all Ukrainian territory but-for Crimea, then the following shall occur:

A legitimate vote shall be held in Crimea (which includes all former Ukrainian folks/pro-Ukraine unity folks who left being able to vote, and does *not* include any Russian/pro-Russian folks who have only lived in Crimea since annexation) on it's status. Each of Russia and Ukraine could pick their option in the vote (Ukraine can offer autonomy/benefits, Russia can try the same though hopefully people know they're lying). The UN would control Crimea for a year of campaigning from both sides leading up to it and would oversee/administer the vote. And regardless of result, both sides agree in advance to de-militarize Crimea, invite UN peacekeepers for 10 years, and mutually administer and share equally in coastal resources. Ideally this would *also* come with Russia paying reparations for starting such a stupid, evil, and illegal war. But they won't agree to such a blow to their pride. So, if Ukraine and Russia want any sort of off-ramp, then this is the way to go.

Ukraine shall not become part of NATO for 25 years, but *shall* become part of the EU and *shall* receive aid to rebuild.

Non-military sanctions on Russia/Russian citizens removed. Military sanctions removed after 10 years.

If Crimea becomes part of Russia legitimately, then Putin gets to say he legitimately got Crimea and only didn't get more because NATO. If Crimea stays part of Ukraine, then he gets to blame NATO. Either way, he - unfortunately - probably gets to live in wealth and comfort. Even if he has to step down from leadership.

And in either case, Ukraine gets to claim a huge defensive victory, and Zelenskyy can say to his people that he's allowing Crimea self-determination.

EDIT: Does this create a 10 year peace followed by another war if Crimea stays part of Ukraine? Possibly. But by then Putin is dead, Ukraine has rebuilt and starts from an even stronger position, *and* is part of the EU so has more security guarantees than before. Russia's cost-benefit becomes even worse than in January of 2022. Could an even more evil leader (a true Russian Hitler) come to power and turn the bad Russian Empire into the evil Nazi Russia (to the extent it isn't already)? Possibly. But Russia by then will be an even weaker state.
