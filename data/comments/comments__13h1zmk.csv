""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday reacted to remarks by former US President Donald Trump that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if re-elected as the president of the US. 

During Zelensky’s visit to Rome, he was asked by a reporter for his response to Trump’s remarks, to which he said: “(When Trump was the US President) there was no full-scale invasion, but there was a war. There was already a Russian aggression. Crimea was occupied, part of Donbas was occupied. I'm not sure if he was deeply involved into this matter, but, nevertheless, he did not solve this issue. I'm not sure it was a priority for him. I am not accusing him of anything. But we have the facts. And we have to look at them,” Zelensky said. 

Trump said at a CNN town hall on Wednesday that he would settle Russia’s war in Ukraine in one day.

“I want everybody to stop dying. They’re dying. Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying,” he said.   

Trump, who would not say whether he wants Ukraine to successfully deter Russia when pressed, told the audience that he doesn’t “think in terms of winning and losing.” 

“I think in terms of getting it settled so we stop killing all these people,” the former president said. 

Zelensky also told reporters in Rome: “(Trump) was president; I was president. And two parts of Ukraine were occupied. No one resolved this issue. No one. The issue is not about Trump.”""",False,1684073706.0,t3_13h1zmk,t3_13h1zmk,,0,97,0,97,0,0,

>Svatovsky sector of the front and battles for Kuzemovka
situation as of 16.00 May 14, 2023

>On the Svatovsky sector of the front, sluggish hostilities have been going on for a long time in the area of Novoselovsky and Kuzemovka.

>The first settlement was abandoned by the Russian troops, because it turned into ruins that are unprofitable to control. The defense of the subdivision of the 1st Panzer Army was taken up in forest plantations to the east of the railway.

>According to our sources, all day yesterday Ukrainian formations tried to push our units out of the defense line west of Kuzemovka. And they allegedly succeeded in part. But we decided to look into the situation and explain what is happening on this sector of the front.

>At the headquarters of the western grouping of troops, nothing is known about leaving the settlement, so we can only assume that in fact it is not about leaving the village, but moving to reserve lines of defense.

>If we analyze the map of this section of the front, then from the terrain we can conclude that in the event of a breakthrough or a threat to the defending units, it is necessary to retreat not to Kuzemovka itself, but to nearby heights.

>Kuzemovka is located in a lowland, and from the east it completely turns into a swamp.

>The news about the ""abandonment"" of Kuzemovka can only mean that the defense of the Taman division was occupied on the surrounding heights, while maintaining fire control over Kuzemovka itself and the corridor to the settlement.

>Probably, the first line of defense along the railway tracks could be left, and then the enemy was hit by fire during an attempt to enter the settlement, which, as it was in the gray zone, continues to remain a draw.",False,1684094104.0,t3_13h1zmk,t3_13h1zmk,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

The news instead has to paint the winning narrative as Erdogan having less than 1st round 50% since they can't wave over their heads the opposition leading. IMO it's an example of a very transparent bias in reporting.

Unfortunately, the other candidate running that is most likely to drop out predominantly siphons votes from Erdogan (5% of the vote), which is more than enough if even only a quarter of his voters switch to Erdogan to boost him over 50%. So he will ultimately come out of this winning. IMO, the media grossly misrepresented the opposition's chances of winning in the lead up to this election. Erdogan is not a great leader IMO, but the news has gone out of their way to paint a picture like his candidacy was imploding when from beginning to election day his party has always been leading and he's been the most likely to win. I've followed it quite a bit.

The spam downvotes from people that can't seperate emotion from reality are a bit rich. I get it, Erdogan sucks, him winning sucks, he's going to win though and the fact that alot of westerners thought he wouldn't is a testament to the biased reporting surrounding the circumstances of the election.

I had this same conversation months ago with someone who was acting like the opposition was going to easily win in the upcoming election. And I pointed out back then the projections firmly showed Erdogan's party winning. Our media did not accurately report on this, plain and simple.

That is almost certainly untrue. Wagner and the official military LOVE to point fingers at each other and blame each other. Also Ukraine has some incredible intelligence during this war because they have access to western spy satalites and recon as well as Ukrainians living in occupied areas who can feed them info. Russia has also been notoriously bad about cell phone usage at the front and unencrypted comms so a good intelligence system can get that information.

The end result is that Ukraine knows about a lot of locations that Russia probably thinks are ""totally unknowable"" and when those go up in smoke Wagner and the official military like to blame each other. Ukraine also likes to play their own pyschological warfare and broadcast messages aimed at Russian troops that say things like ""give us your HQ positions and ammo depot positions and we'll target them with HIMARS instead of your barracks.""

1. you were speaking English the entire time and then suddenly inserted one (likely mispronounced) word in Russian/Ukrainian. Don't do that. She may literally have no clue you switched to a different language mid-sentence and she is still puzzled which English word you used to describe Ukraine.

2. native speakers are EXCEPTIONALLY sensitive to correct pronunciation, correct tone, correct stress on correct syllable etc. Native speakers have large active vocabularies and introducing even subtle differences in sounds may change the meaning to an entirely different word.

You may think it's simple for her to understand which word you said but this is only because your own vocabulary is very limited.

She however is a native speaker. There are dozens of words that sound like ""SLAVA"" but have entirely different meaning. Unless you pronounced it correctly, you may have said ""SLABA UKRAINA"" (Ukraine is weak); ""SLEAVA UKRAINE"" (Ukraine to the left) etc.

Don't do that without a warning. Let the native speakers know that you are using their language before using it.

Simple as that. Also, Joe Biden ain't NATO. There are many more heads of state and officials working behind those scenes than one man.

Look, I got no problem with how Biden has handled this war. He has been a steady and active force in these events. He seems to regard his advisors.

1.  NATO isn't ""US led"".  It's a coalition in which decision making is entirely collaborative.  Part of the reason Ukraine (and Georgia) didn't begin the process of joining in 2008 when the US supported it is because other countries (particularly France and Germany) were against.  Indeed, Sweden still isn't a member despite everyone but (for now) Turkey and Hungary supporting it. The idea that the US is some puppetmaster and the rest of NATO are their puppets is a Russian trope.

2.  Such denial of other countries' agency, believing the US to mysteriously be behind everything, is the same nonsense underlying Russia's refusal to accept Ukraine have agency in this conflict.  That they themselves do not want Russia in their country, murdering their fellow citizens, torturing their brothers, raping their sisters.

3.  Such continuing denial of Ukraine's agency is what is preventing Russia from negotiating with Ukraine's leadership.  Russia seem to think Ukraine's decisions are made in Washington and not Kyiv.  They are wrong.

4.  If the government of Ukraine want to join the EU or NATO, what business is that of Russia?  Russia agreed to recognise Ukraine's independence and promised to stay out of its affairs, promised to respect its internationally recognised borders and then reneged on all of that.

This is the exact same rhethoric used by other countries planning expansive wars of conquest (see Germany in the 1930s) so it's kind of obvious that neighbouring countries would seek defensive treaties or membership in for instance the EU.

If this isn't the guy just succumbing to hypertension or other problems being a dictator and having to appease and even bigger dictator lead to, its kinda suspect. Or at least a very bad/desperate move IMHO.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,13h1zmk,jk3h2t8,"Agree that elections are a fantasy, but I'm also not sure that there are that many factions capable of fighting for control of Russia once Putin is gone. The major power factions in Russia is 1) the FSB, 2) the military, and 3) the National Guard. Wagner and other PMC groups are far too small to have any chance of moving against Putin. 

The National Guard numbers around 400k, including both OMON and Rosgvardiya. Both, but particularly Rosgvardiya, are very loyal to Putin, and led by Putins long-time friend and loyalist Zolotov. Their purpose is domestic security. OMON works more as armored and elite cops on the ground - the guys you'll see on the streets and putting down protests, while Rosgvardiya typically deals more with threats to ""national security"". They are armed enough to deal with populations but afaik don't have any sort of heavy weaponry.

The military goes without saying, but it should be noted that its leader Shoigu is not a career military man and is widely reviled and mocked by Russian soldiers. He is there because he also has history with Putin and is a loyalist. 

The FSB is by far the most influential and powerful faction in Russia, and its leaders constitute the top siloviki elite in Russia: namely Nikolai Patrushev (former FSB director and current Security Council chief), Bortnikov (current FSB director), and of course Putin himself. They don't have tanks or soldiers, but they do have considerable power over politics, and while people make fun of them and consider them incompetent due to the botched assassination attempt on Navalny, they've made short work of other oligarchs who stepped out of line. 

Of all these groups, I think the only one capable of removing Putin first of all is the FSB itself. The National Guard obviously won't move against Putin, and I don't see any way for the military to organize a decapitation strike. Shoigu won't and can't do it, and any Russian general who even suggests it will likely get snitched and  killed quickly. 

Therefore, if it's the FSB who removes Putin, it would be up to either the National Guard or military to contest them for power. But again, the military will still lack the same problem it had with Putin. The FSB successor will determine the new Minister of Defence and there is little chance of any general or military leader being able to lead a march on Moscow. 

The National Guard has a better chance, but as anyone who has seen these guys in real life knows, they are overweight incels who work this job because they have no brain and want to live out their fantasy of feeling powerful. Also, if Putin is dead, they won't have much reason to fight. 

So all that said, my money (if or when Crimea falls) is that Patrushev ousts Putin and allows Mishustin to step in as acting President according to the hierarchy. Mishustin is a faceless technocrat who will be a safe face of transition while the FSB internally sorts out who will step in. There has already been speculation among Russia analysts that Patrushev's son Dmitri has been groomed for the position. Once they've got their guy, they turn on the propaganda machine, make sure the opposition fronts no eligible contenders, and by the next ""election"" Russia is right back to 2000.",False,1684053179.0,t3_13h1zmk,t1_jk3d8jf,,2,14,0,14,0,0,

One of the main problems(in the west at least) is that the ""none-autocratic"" parties  are sadly also full of liars, so the aspiring autocrats will spend an enourmous amount of energy exposing them such that people who are sympathetic towards the autocrats ideas will start to believe that every accusation from ""the wrong side"" is also a lie by extension.

Trump is a terrible leader, but it is at the same time true that leftwingers often accuse him of being as bad as Hitler even when he does or says something that is fairly sensible. Trump supporters are to an extent treated in the same way. People will observe this and become more sympathetic towards him.

The solution is to be more objective. You have to agree with the opposing side whenever they are right and you have to hold your own side accountable. It is not a betrayal of your own side to spend energy exposing their flaws and lies. In the long run it will just make your own side stronger and more moral",1684089830.0,1684084592.0,t3_13h1zmk,t1_jk4r0qj,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

In all wars the soldiers put holes in the enemy and make their fluids drain.  Usually these days that is either bullet or shrapnel from some explosion.  Back in the old days it was bayonet and before that a point attached to a stick that was not a gun or a piece of metal longer than normal bayonets.   There is sometimes burning but that happens because of a hole put in vehicles or ammunition piles.  Bludgeoning or slashing can happen but it is rare.  

There is a lot of nonsense written about what armies are trying to do.  Most of the offense action you see fits perfectly with Ukraine trying to put holes in Russians or their equipment.  It can be very short term.  They know were a target is located because they collected that information.  They looked at the maps and see reason to believe that they can go in and get back out without ending up with their own holes.  

I have more background in materials science and mathematics.  If you put enough stress on a piece of glass it will crack.  Where the crack starts is very difficult to predict.  It often starts from microscopic cracks that you cannot see.  Having no idea where the crack will start and also no idea what shape the pieces will become does not mean that you do not understand the nature of glass.  Tougher materials like rubber or latex can handle a lot of strain.  But with enough pressure they still pop.  If you just keep pumping air into a tire it will blowout.  It does not make sense to talk about adding pressure to one particular part of the balloon.  If you inflate it first you can pop the balloon at any point you choose unless it pops on its own first.",False,1684081887.0,t3_13h1zmk,t1_jk4gfcc,,4,8,0,8,0,0,

Rybar and countless other Russian sources were the first to report pretty accurately about the Bakhmut counterattacks, the Luhansk explosions and the military aircrafts shootdowns (all recent examples, but there are plenty more). All info that got confirmed as true later on by Ukraine. Now of course that doesn't mean that all Russian milbloggers are to be believed, but they definitely didn't have a ""gag ordered on them"" like you said (or do you have a source to prove that?). The only time there is actual punishment against Russian milblogger seems to be when they report on warcrimes, but that's not what we're talking about here.

An interesting theory I read was that Putin actually uses the milbloggers as a sort-of control for his own informants in the Kremlin. Much of the early war clusterfuck didn't even get through to Putin, because everyone was scared of telling the truth and sugar-coated things. So he wants to keep the Milbloggers around, providing somewhat accurate information, so that his inner circle can't bullshit him anymore.  It's just a theory, but a very interesting and plausible one in my opinion, as Putin is definitely someone that knows how to play people against eachother.",False,1684085059.0,t3_13h1zmk,t1_jk4w0rt,,4,20,0,20,0,0,

He was much more reserved and reticent about using American military power after all the war of the last decade at that time, more so than Obama, who also wanted more peace than war (and undertook actions as Presidenr he believed were more important than his personal interests at the time). 

I still don't approve of the tragedy of Afghanistan in how we withdrew, Trump fucking up and laying the groundwork for that mess or not, but he's done a lot of great work in reorienting our focus both to the East with Taiwan and China, as well as reestablished our alliances within thr EU and more.

We, and he as President, have a lot of shortcomings, but this, using our power and might to support those ideals found in our founding documents, universal human ideals, across the globe where we can do the most good is what's important. 

That may make me a radical in the historic sense, but I believe every human on this Earth deserves the right to live in peace and under a government they believe best reflects their values and supports their rights as human beings, their natural rights. America is an idea, an idea Americans are supposed to be always working toward to attain, knowing that perfection will never be possible, but striving to be yet better and more perfect all the same. It knows no boundaries, it knows no lines. Only the truth of what's in your heart - that all people are created equal. That we are all endowed by certain inalienable rights - to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. These rights are natural, God-given, and are not for any one human to strip away from another at their will. No one has the right to infringe these natural rights upon another in their quest and hope for power and vanity. And none of this will change overnight - it will take the long arm of history to bend it toward justice. All we can do is take steps toward that realization, day-by-day, week-by-week, year-by-year until we can look back and see the giant leap from 'then' and 'now'. 

200 years ago the U.S. was the only form of Democracy/Republic on this planet, surrounded by empires and monarchies, in-fighting between aristocratic families across the world in their quest to claim 'mine'.

So it wasn't Biden who made this happen, it was the environment. The vast majority of NATO was thinking in the same direction due to this war. Biden pushed with this majority to make this happen. It wasn't him alone who suddenly created this new direction, it was a community effort.

This is why I said that the US contributed the most, because they're the strongest party of NATO, especially from a military standpoint. However, what made this all happen is that people suddenly had a common goal. This is what united NATO. It wasn't something Biden did.

Not at all.

That Crimean ""independence"" movement was always a Russian scheme to annex the penninsula.  Since Russia couldn't sell it to the locals, they flew in some troops, replaced the Crimean government at gunpoint, and had their NEW government run the ""join Russia now or later"" referendum.  I guess the theory was that nobody paid enough attention to Crimean politics to notice that the leaders got swapped out?

You seem to have a bad habit of taking Russia's stated rationalizations at face value.  Let me spell it out for you:

I never disputed above so that's why I got confused. Russians said clearly that they will defend Belarus as own and that includes potential use of nuclear weapon. It was quite strong message not that long ago and I thought this fact will never be questioned here.

>Also, I am not the one making assumptions, you are. You ASSUME that Russia would definitely use nukes.

Russia may use it and I think it would be very bold move, but very fitting to this opportunity as this is the best opportunity they may have to use nukes on NATO territory without repercussions from NATO itself. And targeting Rzeszów specifically would kill logistical hub supplying Ukraine so that is a win win for Russia.


 >You ASSUME that NATO would absolutely not cover Poland if they were nuked.

I'm sure of it as much as people can be sure of future events, but I'll go with your description as ""assumption"". That's fair enough.


 >I clearly explained to you that the ""rules"" you talk about (which I would guess you are referring to Article 5) are not as specific as you make them out to be.

And that's where you show your lack of knowledge as I was never talking about article 5. Poland going all in into Belarus would take military action outside of military pact of NATO and it wouldn't be covered by art 5. 


>Here is a reference for you: Article 5 provides that if a NATO Ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this act of violence as an armed attack against all members and will take the actions it deems necessary to assist the Ally attacked.

Though your assumption that I have little knowledge or no understanding but you again couldn't be more wrong.  I made no such assumption about you, but rather wanted to provide counterpoints to your statements.  Given the other responses you are receiving as well, I would have thought you might see some problems with your line of reasoning.  That said, as an American who has been in Poland since December of last year, I feel as though I have a pretty damn good feeling of things on the ground here and have a vested interest in this war.

You seem to think that my points are mistaken, while yours are ironclad.  Unfortunately that is not true.  I am not saying that your points are not discussing.  However they are absolutely not a foregone conclusion or fact, if the event in question were to come to pass.

For instance, you take a myopic view of the situation and say that Article 5 could not be invoked because of 'unauthorized aggression '.  That is a narrow-minded view and takes no consideration of the underlying reason for said intervention in the first place. Namely the war Russia started which kicked off this whole shit storm.  It also is completely ignorant to the grievous nature surrounding the use of a nuclear weapon.  In that context, Poland could absolutely ask for Article 5, and NATO could (and likely would) consider it.  

But to just say my point is irrelevant is plain wrong, because you have no concrete information to back it up, just supposition.  I have already pointed out your mistakes and have no desire to continue to do so.  You can believe that whatever you think is fact, no matter how divorced from reality it may be, and I will continue on with better uses if my time.",False,1684101482.0,t3_13h1zmk,t1_jk5w8hb,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
