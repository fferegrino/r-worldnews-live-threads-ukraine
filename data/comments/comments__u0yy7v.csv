Day 47 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the sound of shelling is almost constant again, it’s especially bad around Saltivka, at least 8 people died, many more are injured and at least 10 buildings were damaged. Now Russians started to fire their mines at us. For most of the day, some areas were sealed off so that they could be cleared of mines, as mines were seen in many districts.

[Here’s that sound of artillery that I wrote about yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaberFlux/comments/u1jzoz/the_sound_of_artillery_firing_at_some_nearby/). It’s weird because before this we only heard either the sound of our own artillery shooting at something in the distance or the sound of explosion from a shell that landed nearby, but we never heard both at the same time. Here you can clearly hear both the sound of artillery being fired and an explosion that it causes after around 27 seconds of flight. 

It’s probably nothing, but I still wonder whose artillery it was and what it was firing at, because when we heard those shots there were reports coming from people that some of our districts are being shelled. Today there are actually artillery shots that land even faster than the one I recorded, around 5-10 seconds after being fired.

Bucha’s Month of Terror  
Photographs by Daniel Berehulak  
Written by Carlotta Gall  

A mother killed by a sniper while walking with her family to fetch a thermos of tea. A woman held as a sex slave, naked except for a fur coat and locked in a potato cellar before being executed. Two sisters dead in their home, their bodies left slumped on the floor for weeks.

Bucha is a landscape of horrors.

From the first day of the war, Feb. 24, civilians bore the brunt of the Russian assault on Bucha, a few miles west of Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Russian special forces approaching on foot through the woods shot at cars on the road, and a column of armored vehicles fired on and killed a woman in her garden as they drove into the suburb.

But those early cruelties paled in comparison to what came after.

As the Russian advance on Kyiv stalled in the face of fierce resistance, civilians said, the enemy occupation of Bucha slid into a campaign of terror and revenge. When a defeated and demoralized Russian Army finally retreated, it left behind a grim tableau: bodies of dead civilians strewn on streets, in basements or in backyards, many with gunshot wounds to their heads, some with their hands tied behind their backs.

Reporters and photographers for The New York Times spent more than a week with city officials, coroners and scores of witnesses in Bucha, uncovering new details of execution-style atrocities against civilians. The Times documented the bodies of almost three dozen people where they were killed — in their homes, in the woods, set on fire in a vacant parking lot — and learned the story behind many of their deaths. The Times also witnessed more than 100 body bags at a communal grave and the city’s cemetery.

The evidence suggests the Russians killed recklessly and sometimes sadistically, in part out of revenge.

Unsuspecting civilians were killed carrying out the simplest of daily activities. A retired teacher known as Auntie Lyuda, short for Lyudmyla, was shot midmorning on March 5 as she opened her front door on a small side street. Her body lay twisted, half inside the door, more than a month later.

Her younger sister Nina, who was mentally disabled and lived with her, was dead on the kitchen floor. It was not clear how she died.

“They took the territory and were shooting so no one would approach,” a neighbor, Serhiy, said. “Why would you kill a grandma?”

Roman Havryliuk, 43, a welder, and his brother Serhiy Dukhli, 46, sent the rest of their family out of Bucha as the violence intensified, but both insisted on staying behind. They were found dead in their yard. “My uncle stayed for the dog, and my father stayed for the house,” Mr. Havryliuk’s son, Nazar, said. An unknown man also lay dead nearby, and the family’s two dogs were riddled with bullets.

“They were not able to defeat our army so they killed ordinary people,” said Nazar, 17.

Constant threat from snipers
Bucha had been one of the most desirable commuter suburbs of Kyiv. Nestled between fir tree forests and a river, it had modern shopping malls and new residential complexes as well as old-fashioned summer cabins set among gardens and trees. The Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov had a summer house there.

Days after Russian troops drove into town, the Ukrainian Army struck back, setting tanks and armored vehicles ablaze in an attack on a Russian column. As many as 20 vehicles burned in a huge fireball that ignited homes all along one side of the street. Some Russian soldiers fled, carrying their wounded through the woods.

Russian reinforcements arrived several days later in an aggressive mood. They set up base in an apartment complex behind School No. 3, the main high school on Vokzalna, or Station Street, and posted a sniper in a high-rise building still under construction. They made their headquarters farther south in a glass factory on the Bucha River.

Until then, the residents of Bucha had been sheltering from Russian missile and artillery strikes, many of them sleeping in basements and cellars, but some had ventured outside from time to time to get water or sneak a look at the damage. Shelling had been sporadic, and much of the Russian artillery fire was aimed over their heads at Irpin, the next town over.

After the assault on the column, the atmosphere hardened. On March 4, Volodymyr Feoktistov, 50, set out on foot around 5 p.m. to pick up a loaf of bread from neighbors who were baking at home. His mother and brother had told him not to go out, but he insisted, his mother recalled later.

Russian vehicles were driving along a road at the end of their street and the neighbors heard two gunshots. They found him the next day, dead on the street. Days passed before they could load him into a wheelbarrow and push him to the hospital morgue before hurrying home.

On March 5, a Russian sniper began firing on anything moving south of the high school.

Auntie Lyuda was shot in the morning. That afternoon, a father and his son stepped out of their gate to go for a walk along their street, Yablunska, or Apple Tree Street. “They shot my son,” his father, Ivan, said. “I was next to him. It would be better if it had been me.”

He asked that only his first name be published. Many residents in Bucha were frightened after weeks under Russian occupation and asked that their surnames not be published for fear of retribution at a later stage.

“He was suffering the whole night and died at 8:20 a.m.,” Ivan said of his son. The family buried him in the front garden under a huge mound of earth. “It’s very hard to bury your child,” Ivan said. “I would not wish that on my worst enemy.”

His son left behind an 8-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter. “I cannot look my grandson in the eyes,” Ivan said.

Yablunska Street, where they lived, soon became the deadliest stretch of road for passing civilians. A man on his bicycle was struck by fire from an armored vehicle in early March, as video recorded by the Ukrainian military showed. By March 11 there were at least 11 dead bodies lying on the street and sidewalks, satellite footage showed.

Michael Kofman (one of the best US-based Russian military analysts) had estimated around 40 BTGs were destroyed/no longer capable, but admitted that he was giving a cautious/conservative estimate.

Now we have that tweet in the live thread that Western analysts are assessing that 37-38 BTGs have been rendered combat ineffective, which is roughly in line with Kofman's estimate. (And likely also a cautious/conservative estimate.)

So if we say that Russia had 120-128 BTGs committed to the Ukraine invasion, conservative estimates are that about 30% of their BTGs are now not capable of fighting. That's massive.

(Ukrainian forces have also likely taken significant losses, but given that they have primarily been fighting on the defensive, their losses are probably significantly lower.)",False,1649691567.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

From CNN's Michael Conte

Russia is attempting to resupply and reinforce its forces in the Donbas, according to a senior US defense official, as evidenced by a convoy of vehicles approaching the Ukrainian city of Izyum from the north.

The vehicle line includes a “command and control element, a support battalion, basically enablers, perhaps rotary wing aviation support and other infantry support,” according to the official.

The official also said there is evidence that Russia is attempting to reinforce its position southwest of the city of Donetsk primarily with artillery units.

The agency said in a press release that paying in rubles instead of dollars amounted to a “selective default.”

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer intends to tell Russian President Vladimir Putin “the truth” about the war in Ukraine during their face to face meeting in Moscow on Monday, according to a top Austrian official.

Nehammer is set to be the first EU leader to meet with Putin since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February.

He visited Kyiv to meet Ukraine's President Volodymy Zelensky on Saturday.

Speaking ahead of an EU meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, Austria's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told reporters ""it makes a difference to be face to face and tell him what the reality is: that this president has de facto lost the war morally.""

It should be in his own interest that someone tells him the truth. I think it is important and we owe it to ourselves if we want to save human lives.

If they try another large scale offensive and fail they could be looking at absurd losses a couple month from now... imagine they lose another 40000 (and all the equipment) and suddenly they are sitting at half strength with no good ways to replenish their ranks or equipment.

I’m pretty sure they realize this and they’re going to dig in for the long haul and ramp up war crimes and indiscriminate artillery strikes against the areas they contest in the east and south. I think they could sustain a situation like that for several more months, limping along financially off the back of their oil/gas exports and waiting for international interest in the conflict to die down.

I imagine that even in a scenario where Europe fully cuts off Russian gas imports they will still have trade partners like India who are eager to pour money into their economy in any way possible.

From CNN's DJ Judd

The White House said Vladimir Putin's decision to appoint Army Gen. Alexander Dvornikov as theater commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine “is not going to erase the fact that this is a strategic failure.”

Dvornikov, 60, was the first commander of Russia’s military operations in Syria, after Putin sent troops there in September 2015 to back the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

During Dvornikov’s command in Syria from September 2015 to June 2016, Russian aircraft backed the Assad regime and its allies as they laid siege to rebel-held eastern Aleppo, bombarding densely populated neighborhoods and causing major civilian casualties.

“What we should all be aware of, and we are certainly aware of, is this is a general who was already responsible for overseeing atrocities in Syria, and that we would expect that it would be a continuation of the type of atrocities we've already seen take place in Ukraine,” Psaki told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Monday, “But again, they have not — it has not gone as President Putin has planned, and we don't expect a change in personnel we'll change that.”

Looking forward, Psaki said the Biden administration anticipates Russian forces “will seek to surround and overwhelm Ukrainian forces,” in Eastern Ukraine, where they’ve coalesced forces after unsuccessful efforts to capture Kyiv and the surround areas, while continuing “to launch air and missile strikes across the rest of the country to cause military and economic damage.”

“And we expect this stage of the conflict could last a long time, and we should have no illusions that Russia is going to adjust their tactics and make them less brutal, and certainly changes in leadership reflect a continuation of the type of atrocities we've seen, or the type of approach that we've seen, and we've also predicted from the beginning,” she added.",False,1649700961.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

370 villagers were locked in a cellar for a month while soldiers plundered their homes

The russians rolled into Yahidne, a small farming village just south of Chernihiv in northern Ukraine, shortly after 4pm on March 3rd. The weeks that followed may not be forgotten for centuries. At least 20 of the villagers died during 28 days of occupation. Six were shot in highly suspicious circumstances. A father and his 12-year-old daughter were gunned down as they tried to escape; the weapons used were so powerful they severed the girl’s head. Another dozen died from suffocation in a basement in the local school. They were locked in there, along with the entire village, as human shields to protect a massive Russian army camp above ground during the whole period.

Olga Martienko mops up tears with a pink scarf as she recalls the experience. She is 57, but looks a great deal older. There were 370 people sheltering in the school basement (pictured), she says; the youngest was a month old. Four to each square metre, the neighbours slept standing against one another, breathing in the same increasingly putrid air, and relieving themselves in the same bucket at the top of the stairs. On some days they were allowed out to breathe some fresh air; but on others they were not. “Almost as soon as the bombing started, people started hallucinating,” Mrs Martienko says. For significant periods, the villagers were forced to cohabit with corpses in the basement, as the most frail passed away and there was no way of taking the bodies out.

Ms Martienko’s spot was at the entrance to the cellar. She was first to face Russian soldiers when they dropped by with their regular inspections. She braced herself whenever she saw torchlights under the cracks of the basement door. Some of them whispered words of horror at the conditions, she says. Others came in drunk, and asked why she was so old; they wanted young girls for sex, they said. One rotation tried to make them sing the Russian national anthem; the villagers refused, and they recollect this moment of solidarity with laughter and with pride. “We counted the days right up until they left,” says Ms Martienko. “It was like being born again when we saw they had gone.”

The Russians left quickly on the night of March 30th, bolting the door and ordering Yahidne’s residents not to leave the basement until morning. In their rush, the soldiers left behind equipment and stark insights into their primitive ways. Cigarettes, bottles, human waste and stolen clothes—bras included—still litter their dugouts and sleeping quarters in the school’s ground floors. Outside the school, just beyond six white body bags, is a crate of military propaganda. The “military patriotic preparedness” boxes were apparently used to explain to the soldiers why they were fighting in Ukraine: teaching aids sketch key dates of glorious Russian history and the Russian military oath; a map shows most of Ukraine as historic Russia. Another crate contains reading materials: a book of the Dalai Lama’s teachings, and a magazine from Tuva, the Buddhist region of southern Russia where some of the units came from.

The villagers say that the Tuvan soldiers were the most cruel of all—especially when they started drinking. “They couldn’t handle their alcohol and didn’t understand us,” says Natalya Cherepenko, a small-scale farmer. “We did our best to avoid any contact with them.” The Tuvans lived away from the school, commandeering the villagers’ ramshackle but proudly kept huts in five parallel streets. Those streets were no-go areas without an armed escort, says Mrs Cherepenko. Ethnic Russian soldiers, generally more “understanding” of the Ukrainian villagers, would occasionally offer that protection, allowing the villagers to their homes to collect a change of clothes and medicines. They even kept guard as Mrs Cherepenko milked her cows, which she was allowed to do once a day. “One of the young lads kept saying sorry to me. He said he was from Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, that he thought he would be doing military exercises, and that his mum had no idea he was in Ukraine.”

The villagers tell stories of soldiers and commanders making ethical choices inside a lawless military structure that expected nothing of them. One type of soldier killed and ransacked their homes, they say, stealing expensive laptop computers, alcohol, chickens, and everything else they could lay their hands on. But another category went out of their way to make life easier for the villagers, allowing them out when commanders weren’t looking. They were the ones who brought water, and doctors to them during nights of the worst bombardment. “Of course, we all understood we were human shields locked in a basement at their pleasure,” says Nadezhda Tereshchenko, “but they told us they were taking responsibility for our safety while we were there, and I think there is some truth to that.”

Halyna, a villager whose missing brother-in-law was found buried with gunshot wounds to his head, is less charitable. She says the majority of the soldiers belonged to a third category: oblivious to the destruction they were creating, yet arrogant enough to believe they were doing God’s work. “The most upsetting thing was seeing them bring you water, and thinking they were doing you a good deed,” she says, “while you realise they are wearing your kid’s brand new trainers.”",False,1649688124.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,58,0,58,0,0,

She doesn’t want to arm Ukraine. I guess she thinks Russia, who is the aggressor remember, will just sit down and negotiate. It almost sounds like she’s okay with giving Ukraine over to Putin.

From CNN’s James Frater in Brussels and Jorge Engels in London 

The European Union’s top diplomat said Monday that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “big failure of the Russian army.”  

“They tried to conquer Kyiv, and they have been rejected. Now they have abandoned Kyiv, they see that it's impossible for them to take the capital,” EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said at a news conference in Luxembourg.  

“They are regrouping their troops in the east and Ukrainians are very much convinced that they are going to launch a big offensive in the Donbas nearby their logistic bases,” he said. 

Borrell also characterized the invasion as a “horror.”  

“What the Russian army left behind is civilians killed, cities destroyed, indiscriminate bombing, like the one that we see on the railway station [in Kramatorsk]. We are very much worried by the human consequences of this war,"" he added.   

Borrell also said “nothing is off the table” when it came to new sanctions against Russia, including oil and gas, but that no decision had been taken Monday. 

“It's easy for some member states that are not using Russian gas to say that they are ready to not use Russian gas, but for others which are heavily dependent is not so easy,” said Borrell. 

He added that EU member states continue discussing how to implement the sanctions and how to avoid “loopholes.” ",False,1649705911.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

Western leaders are grappling with how far to escalate their military aid to Ukraine as the Russian invasion seems headed for a brutal new turn, a decision that may rest on whether the West's goal is to push for a total defeat of President Vladimir Putin.

Heroic resistance from Ukrainian troops, with the help of Western anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, has already claimed a famous victory — the saving of Kyiv and the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. But now, Russia has named a new general to lead what has been a chaotic war effort and is grouping its forces in eastern Ukraine for a fearsome, concentrated assault that could stretch Ukraine's outnumbered forces as never before.

The shift of strategy is forcing Western leaders to consider their own willingness to provide more offensive armaments to Kyiv ahead of what is shaping up to be a vicious battle that could dictate how much of Ukraine survives as a nation-state.

Pressure on the West to do more is being exacerbated by the fact that Russia's new approach augurs yet more carnage for the civilians that it has been deliberately targeting with a vicious war plan.",False,1649652531.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

From CNN's Michael Conte

Russia is attempting to resupply and reinforce its forces in the Donbas, according to a senior US defense official, as evidenced by a convoy of vehicles approaching the Ukrainian city of Izyum from the north.

The vehicle line includes a “command and control element, a support battalion, basically enablers, perhaps rotary wing aviation support and other infantry support,” according to the official.

The official also said there is evidence that Russia is attempting to reinforce its position southwest of the city of Donetsk primarily with artillery units.

The US does not assess that this is “a new offensive” in the Donbas, according to the official, rather that the Russian forces are “working to reinforce their capabilities and to add to it.”

Meanwhile, the US Defense Department is considering options for training more Ukrainians on the Switchblade drone system, according to the senior US defense official.

April 11/22 : 00 ID : 6253c7234909af00134c3fbb _

The forty-seventh era of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began.

The full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against our State continues.

The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops to act in the Slobozhansky direction. Probably in the coming days, the occupiers will try to resume the offensive.

In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities in Ukraine.

Weapons and military equipment are being prepared at the permanent deployment point of the 60th separate motorized infantry brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th all-military army of the Eastern Military District. It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region. Also, in order to recover the losses of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motorized infantry brigade (Borzya, Transbaikalia region) of the 29th All-Military Army of the Eastern Military District, recruits are being recruited from the brigade. The enemy feels a special problem when recruiting drivers and mechanics. Departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.

It is possible that the armed forces of the Russian Federation will carry out provocative actions in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.

Probably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of hostilities, will continue to strike at transport infrastructure facilities in Ukraine in order to destroy or disable them.

Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.

In the Slobozhansky direction separate divisions from a warehouse

The 6th All-Army and Coastal Troops of the Northern Fleet continue to partially blockade the city of Kharkiv, and artillery shelling continues in some areas of the city.

Aerial reconnaissance of the area is underway in the Izium direction in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. To do this, the enemy uses the UAV ""Orlan-10"".

With the help of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, was unsuccessful, and retreated to its former positions.

In the Donetsk direction, the enemy continues to focus on taking control of the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nyzhne and Novobahmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.

The enemy tried to storm the area of ​​Golden, but was unsuccessful.

In the city of Mariupol, with the support of artillery and aircraft, the occupiers continue to storm the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.

With the help of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of our troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka, and Maryanske.

Over the past 24hrs, the defenders of Ukraine have repulsed four enemy attacks in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.

We believe in the Armed Forces of Ukraine! Let's win together! Glory to Ukraine!""

>Putin's spokesman said Russia “have suffered significant losses of troops"". BBC was able to verify identities of the 1,083 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine (they were reported by local officials or media in Russia). So what do we see and know? Thread

>Even if we talk about confirmed losses only - there is evidence that Russia has lost some of its best specialists, incl. elite spec. forces operators, highly skilled fighter pilots and some experienced commanders.

>217 out of 1083 confirmed losses - ie over 20% - are officers. This includes 10 colonels, 20 lieutenant colonels, 31 majors and 155 junior officers (ranging from second lieutenant to captain).\3

>It takes 5 years and at least 10.000 USD to prepare an infantry lieutenant in Russia. For other specialties prices rise up to 60.000 USD per one young officer. It costs from 4 to 14 mln USD (and up to 14 years) to prepare a skillful fighter pilot.\4

>I underline that a high number of officers in the list of established losses doesn't mean that every 5th Russian killed on the battlefield was an officer. Fallen commanders are usually given a special treatment in the Russian army, so they can be sent home earlier than others

>We also noticed another trend. About 15% of all confirmed losses are paratroopers from units, which are considered elite of the Russian army. And preparation of a paratrooper in Russia demands more money and time compared to an infantryman. So these are sensitive losses.

>Some servicemen were very experienced. E.g. fighter pilot Sergey Volynets (captain)  fought in Georgia and Syria, he had several medals

>There are at least 15 GRU special forces operators (including 5officers) and 3 maroon berets (краповые береты) in the confirmed losses list.These take months or even years to train and educate.Test to get a maroon beret is considered to be one of the hardest in the military world

>But there are also people of unexpected specialties in the list. On March 28 the death of the military orchestra sergeant Alexander Karpeyev was reported. He played the trumpet. Publications do not say what tasks he performed in Ukraine.

>From the official reports we see that usually it takes at least 2 weeks for bodies to be delivered home. Sometimes it takes more than a month. Some bodies require a DNA test to establish an identity

>MoD last updated their figures on March 25 - just 4 days after first BBC publication about Russian losses (they were silent for 23 days before). MoD states there are 1351 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine. It’s unclear whether Rosgvardia losses are included in this figure.

>More figures and some grphics summarising info about confirmed #Russian military losses in #Ukraine can be found here https://bbc.com/russian/features-61003964… It was our joint effort with @Olya_Prosvirova.

Again, this was before today’s reports, so even without confirmation of the possible chemical attack, the sheer number of civilian casualties is horrifically astounding.

This has morphed to an issue of massive internal resistance and pride against the West, and if there is one thing Russia has trained its people well on over the last two centuries its how to suffer for the motherland. An internal oligarch revolution is more likely than a popular mass revolution anytime in the near future. 

My reading is the only thing that would break this spirit is a climatic, conclusive military loss by the Russian forces in Ukraine. That might be enough to shake confidence of elite and non-elite Russians to force a change. 

That's why Putin is shifting tactics to a long, dragged out war in the areas they already loosely control to wait out Western patience, bleed Ukraine economically dry, and buy time to keep that Russian spirit in victory alive.",False,1649696177.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

I actually disagree with his criticisms here.

But that isn't the issue. To be clearer, 

1) NATO != NATO countries, and Zelensky, rand Ukrainian politicians/mayors/people and individual soldiers have been very appreciative of everything NATO countries (and some others) have done

2) Pushing on NATO to do more is good for Zelenskyy. This doesn't make his criticisms right, but in the 60 minutes interview it's clear he's pushing himself the most to ensure he is doing everything he can all the time. 

In this case, he critiques NATO. The response, ideally and likely, would be more aid and support.

But nearly any negotiation or peace that doesn't involve a complete expulsion of Russians though force (which is ideal but very unlikely) is very likely to involve not joining NATO. Ever. But getting security guarantees from specific countries.

So he also benefits from Ukrainians, who are extremely pro-NATO (both member countries and NATO itself) being more willing to accept giving up NATO aspirations (and again, Ukraine joining NATO has always been an uphill struggle) in exchange for security guarantees from an individual country, whist still being on good terms with NATO member states who are supporting him

I know that militaries love running drills, that’s sort of what they do, they practice doing things that they might have to do for real some day. One thing that I’m sure they know that they might have to do some day, but that is really difficult to actually practice, is training up a much larger military really fast.

Today will be ‘last battle’ for Mariupol as ammunition is ‘running out’, Ukraine says

Ukrainian forces say they are readying themselves for a “last battle” to control the besieged southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, AFP reports.

In a statement on Facebook, the 36th marine brigade of the Ukrainian armed forces said:

Today will probably be the last battle, as the ammunition is running out.

After defending the port for 47 days and doing “everything possible and impossible” to retain control of the city, the marines said it had been “pushed back” and “surrounded” by the Russian army, adding: It’s death for some of us, and captivity for the rest.

Russian forces have said fighting has recently centred around Mariupol’s Azovstal iron and steel works and in the port.

The marines said that is where “the enemy gradually pushed us back” and “surrounded us with fire, and is now trying to destroy us”.

The mountain of wounded makes up almost half of the brigade. Those whose limbs are not torn off return to battle. The infantry was all killed and the shooting battles are now conducted by artillerymen, anti-aircraft gunners, radio operators, drivers and cooks. Even the orchestra.

It complained that there was a lack of support from Ukraine’s military leadership “because we’ve been written off”.

The south-eastern city of Mariupol has seen the most intense fighting since Russia launched its assault on Ukraine. Earlier today, the Ukraininan president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said tens of thousands of people had likely been killed in the city.

Zelenskiy told the South Korean parliament via video link: Mariupol has been destroyed, there are tens of thousands of dead, but even despite this, the Russians are not stopping their offensive.",False,1649682107.0,t3_u0yy7v,t3_u0yy7v,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

I have very little knowledge of the MacronLe Penn run off election other than Le Penn is far right, believes Putin should be an ally to France and she supposedly has toned down son of her extreme views. Given the recent “elections “ of far right candidate in Hungary and Serbia My question is does she have a viable chance at winning and if she does, what kind of problems could that cause for the Western alliance?

On the major operational shift to the East specifically Donbas and the wider open terrain well suited for large scale tank battles:
The shift will, I think, necessitate a major change in strategy for Ukraine as it doesn’t seem like their favored style of guerilla warfare and small scale engagements are going to be as effective in this area. Can these tanks the West has been sending get there in time and will it be enough to be effective?

“Senior American military officials and some analysts have said this next phase of the war will be fought on terrain more favorable to Russia’s tanks and infantry units. The fight in the east would also initially be closer to Moscow’s supply lines and fought in a narrower battle space — major differences from the war’s initial phase, in which logistics problems and overstretched troops doomed Russia’s plan to seize Ukraine quickly.

Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last Thursday that the terrain was “much more open and lends itself to armored mechanized offensive operations on both sides.”

Title: Bottle inside a Russian ""Orlan-10"" army drone.

0:01 … We've gathered a number of downed Russian drones for study. We wanted to share examples of the ""space age"" engineering with our Western partners, but as soon as we've sent a couple of photos they went into a system shock. ""Are you f-n kidding us?"" they said. ""This could not possibly be  modern army technology. Dig through this garbage yourselves."" 
And here we are…

0:20 Let's take a look at the ""Orlan-10"" drone and check out some of those ""super up to date"" technical solutions, held together by the notorious ""spiritual bonds"" so dear to every Russian soul. (cynical)

0:30 Perhaps we'll be able to spy on some technological tricks we can later teach in our middle-school hobby workshops. (cynical)

0:44 Let's begin. This is drone's camera unit. The front plate proudly states, ""Made in Russia."" But in the back is a ""Cannon"" camera … fastened with Velcro!  

1:00 The best feature -- you can unfasten the ""Cannon"" and use it to take selfies.

1:08 The camera (being Japanese) is in perfect working order (even after downing of the drone).

1:10 Take a look, Russians engineers have super-glued the mode-dial, so the camera does not accidentally turn off in flight. The zoom is also fixed. The bottom two lenses are thermal-vision modules.

1:24 There's a plethora of other curious technical solutions which I shall not waste your time on, because I want to show you the most important part -- the notorious ""spiritual bond"" no modern Russian technology exists without …

1:38 … THE BOTTLE !

1:41 I am not pulling your leg, and this is not a fake. This here says, ""Fuel tank,"" and here ""Ignition"". And this is a plastic screw cap and a common soda bottle, riveted in here.

2:05 In short, ""Without a bottle the Russia can't be Russia.""",1649678290.0,1649665764.0,t3_u0yy7v,t1_i49px9n,,1,117,0,117,0,0,

You could speculate as to why, perhaps much of that russian equipment truly exists only on paper to begin with. Lacking the parts to repair aircraft, and thus the true # of aircraft for Russia is much, much lower.

The air defenses are also likely making risk averse generals even more afraid, it isn't a guarantee that the UA can shoot down every plane over Ukraine, but what if they shoot down a few here and there? if Russia loses those aircraft than they have even less for a rainy day in the future.

Furthermore the lack of smart munitions on Russians side make an sorties that much less effective. Dumb bombs from smart planes? not a very good tactic. The strength of modern multi-role fighters comes mostly from their advanced weapons.

>Defense Minister Jaroslav Naď  said that if Slovakia would give up its MiGs, its airspace could be protected by US F-16s stationed in Poland.

>The Defense Minister said the MiG-29s wouldn’t be able to fly for long in Slovak service anyway since the Russian technicians that service them have withdrawn from the country.

>The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their   
numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the   
official purse, but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything   
necessary to the action of a soldier. The colonels of regiments and   
officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number  
 on the books and as small a number in the field  
 as possible — inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the   
between these figures. They have an interest also in the men being as   
inadequately fed and clothed as possible — inasmuch they pocket the   
difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended  
 on the soldiers’ rations and accoutrements. The Emperor provides (or   
believes he does) for the food, clothing, lodging, arms and ammunition   
of 5 or 600,000 men; but every one of these who is or can be made   
non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest   
official or officer; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from   
the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the   
major; every ammunition waggon which is paid for by Government, but not   
provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the   
contractor. Robbery and peculation of this sort is universal, in every   
rank, in every district, in every branch. It runs through every   
department in the Empire; and its operation upon the efficiency of the   
military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily

Russia entered the country with trucks, that sometimes even did not have spare tires! That means a puncture resulted in a loss of the truck.

Of course repairing is easier for Ukrainians as theier ar in their home country.

For every crewmember onboard of a tank, there are several behind that in logistics and engineering to keep the machine running. You don't just need a shiny new tank.

The leopard does have a loader position which Soviet tanks don't have, so a new position needs to be trained into their tank crews, as well as a new tank crew culture to deal with a 4man crew.

Not an immediate boost for them what with retraining and integration, but will be a welcome add-on for them.

*In the 1980s Daly was a member of the Labour Party as a teenager but was* ***expelled*** *alongside other members after being accused of being* ***Trotskyists*** *infiltrating the party using the tactic of entryism. She was subsequently a founding member of ""Militant Labour"", later known as the Socialist Party...*

*In late January 2022, Daly described the Russian troop build up on the Ukrainian border as being* ***""clearly defensive""*** *and believed there is ""no evidence that Russia has any desire to invade Ukraine, it would be of no benefit to them""...*

*On 2 March 2022, she was one of 13 MEPs who voted against a resolution condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine...*

Once those stockpiles run out in a few years, we'll see aircraft being cannibalized to keep the rest of the fleet running, parts being bought on the black market, parts being used beyond their service life (which vastly increases the failure risk), and attempts to reverse engineer parts (for a lot of small aircraft parts, the problem isn't making the part, it's meeting the monumental quality and safety certifications that apply in western countries, and if you remove that, making a knock-off becomes relatively simple).

There has not been much reports of volunteers that I’ve seen.

Puppet states like Belarus have made the news so far for NOT committing any troops to the fight. Whether or not Russia can twist their arm and make them invade Ukraine remains to be seen.

Which brings us to reservists and conscripts. The estimates I’ve seen are that Russia is intending to field 60000 new bodies within the next several months. If successful, that will obviously help them shore up most of the gaps that they’ve sustained.

Presumably those new guys could be garrisoned inside Russia or in occupied areas to free up other troops to join the frontlines. But you have to wonder how combat-ready those other troops will really be? What systems if any will they have training on? Will any of them have any combat experience?

This could be the NATO red line. At the very least, individual nations might break and support Ukraine militarily, like Poland.

It could turn Russia's few actual powerful allies (a cautious China, basically, even India has distanced itself this week) away to neutrality if not opposition.

If Russia has used CWs in Ukraine, it's just doomed itself. At a minimum it's a permanent international pariah that I don't believe even regime change would fix. Total denuclearisation and extensive demilitarisation would be the likely demands to rehabilitate Russia back into global society.

Russia can't even plausibly become North North Korea, to use the popular joke.

North Korea survives as a pariah state because it's:

+ Small

+ Not a real threat to anyone

+ Not populous

+ Population centres are physically close to its patron, China. Pyongyang is not difficult to reach from major Chinese cities.

Therefore, places like China prop it up willingly because it's a useful idiot. Like a small dog, it jumps and barks but isn't really a threat, just a lot of noise.

Russia is none of those. It's:

+ Physically huge and a logistical challenge to cross

+ A real threat to world stability with a substantial nuclear arsenal

+ Populous enough that it could raise a substantial army

+ Main population centres are half a world from the most likely patron, also China.

China is likely interested in exploiting everything Siberia and East - the oil, the minerals, the other resources. It won't want the cities in the West to be its problem. A headache to supply and feed and zero value economically to China. China might take Eastern Russia but it will let the West fall. It's a dead weight that would bind and cripple them financially. China forced to be Moscow's life support would be a huge strategic victory for the US and would all but end China's expansionist visions in South East Asia.

From CNN's Michael Conte

Russia is attempting to resupply and reinforce its forces in the Donbas, according to a senior US defense official, as evidenced by a convoy of vehicles approaching the Ukrainian city of Izyum from the north.

The vehicle line includes a “command and control element, a support battalion, basically enablers, perhaps rotary wing aviation support and other infantry support,” according to the official.

The official also said there is evidence that Russia is attempting to reinforce its position southwest of the city of Donetsk primarily with artillery units.

The US does not assess that this is “a new offensive” in the Donbas, according to the official, rather that the Russian forces are “working to reinforce their capabilities and to add to it.”

Meanwhile, the US Defense Department is considering options for training more Ukrainians on the Switchblade drone system, according to the senior US defense official.

But the official said no decisions have been made about “what that would look like, how long would it take, where would it be, who would train.”

A lot of French citizens posting are skeptical of claims that she might win because she got trounced last time and historical patterns in France are against her somewhat. 

Here are some things to consider, though:

1. Macron has focused heavily on the Ukraine crisis, which is a very low priority for most voters. The majority of French voters cast their votes for anti-NATO parties in the first round. That means he might be focusing on a losing issue while LePen focuses on winning issues of inflation, cost-of-living, immigration and restricting religious minority rights. 

2. Momentum is clearly on LePen's side.

3. No French President has won reelection since 2002. 

4. The share of the non-radical vote is below 35%. Macron, the arch-moderate liberal, will need to attract a *lot* of hard-left radicals to hold on to power. These voters tend to hate him very, very much. 

That's not to say LePen *will* win - again, Macron is still favoured. It's just that his victory is nowhere near as certain as it was five years ago.",False,1649698313.0,t3_u0yy7v,t1_i4b7zh6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

>What a fast-track process would look like to decide upon Swedish and Finnish membership remains to be seen. It would surely obviate the Membership Action Plan process that has been used to admit every NATO member starting with the 2004 enlargement round and which would likely apply to a country like Kosovo, which has already asked for accelerated membership in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Stoltenberg’s comments suggest that informal thinking is already underway about how this would work**. If all parties were in agreement informally on the way ahead, we assess that it should take approximately a month to submit and consider the applications, and schedule a vote. The ratification processes in the thirty allied capitals would inevitably take much longer. In the meantime, the United States and the United Kingdom could issue interim security guarantees to Sweden and Finland.** Washington, Stockholm, and Helsinki have an existing trilateral defense cooperation agreement that could be broadened and expanded for this purpose.",False,1649696823.0,t3_u0yy7v,t1_i4bc2y8,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

It might easily be much worse than ""a few percentage points of GDP"" and it will definitely not be restricted to the German economy.

I would love to be able to say ""fuck you Pootin"" and put a complete embargo on Russian energy. But in the short term, that would hurt Europe (and their ability to help Ukraine) more than it would hurt Russia.
The point is that even a complete embargo today would not stop Putin's war machine tomorrow or even next week. It would only prevent him from starting the next war. However, this can be achieved by moving away from Russian energy within the next months and as soon as possible.

Maybe I am wrong, I am absolutely not an Economist. But even the best economists in the world cannot predict the outcome of a preemptive embargo.

This could be because Russia’s military doctrine is all about identifying weaknesses and breaking through.

Once a breach is successful, the light Russian vehicles are free to attack supply lines, encircle enemy troops etc. 

If you look at any of Russia’s battle plans at any time, then, it would seem that UA’s army is always under threat of getting surrounded.

However just because they can perform these maneuvers in a textbook doesn’t mean they are ever successful at it in practice. You need a lot of things to successfully break through enemy defenses. You need units that can quickly react to changes in a dynamic battle space. Secure, efficient comms. Secure logistics lines. Reliable equipment. Air superiority or air supremacy makes a huge difference too. You know... all the things Russia has struggled with so far.

Not to mention Ukraine has employed a “defense in depth” strategy throughout the war. Rather than concentrating all their available forces in a solid front line, they have several layers of defensive lines and have consistently allowed Russian armor to over penetrate and make itself vulnerable to anti-armor counter attacks.

Russia’s military theoretically outnumbers the Ukrainian’s plenty but as the initial invasion has shown it’s largely a paper tiger army with incredibly bad logistical/communications/supply problems. And incredibly bad might be an understatement. They have lost over half the generals(!) that were in Ukraine. This is not going to change anytime soon. 

UKraine does not control the skies above Ukraine but neither does Russia. The conventional dominance Russia has enjoyed in its latest major battles is nonexistent in Ukraine. 

Russia’s economy is smaller than Italy while being the largest nation by land mass. While they technically had enough money to finance a lot of war, the freezing of assets by the west and tight sanctions mean that oil/gas are really the only real important revenue coming into the country. If Putin intends to make this a war of attrition it puts ever more incentive for EU to go elsewhere with their business. 

The west is behind Ukraine because Putin’s attack on Ukraine was more than meant to topple the government of the ‘borderlands’. It was a clear message of challenge to the world order. And whether they all understood this or not, the west and its Allies galvanized against Russian aggression. Ukraine is not as good as they are at knowing Russian positions and weaknesses by themselves. Intelligence is flowing from the west as well as weapons, ammo, armor, and even volunteers. 

So yes, three months ago if we were looking down the barrel of a pointed Russian offense in the east, moving across the southern part of the country then your assessment would hold weight. But as of today, Russia has mostly played its hand. Other than a bloodbath and ever tighter noose of sanctions, they have little to show for it.",False,1649716921.0,t3_u0yy7v,t1_i4cj3ka,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

It's a lot of hard miles of fighting to make the connection between north and south, while also having to defend supply lines behind you.  And despite all the talk of reinforcements in the Izium front, there's been no such talk of new units becoming available in the southern (Zaporizhzhia) front, where Russia has shown zero ability to move the Ukrainian line.

The rumor right now is that Russia's northern attack wants to aim for Dnipro.  Imagine being a Russian at the outskirts of Dnipro--you're 200km deeper into Ukraine than any other unit in the war.  Essentially you're 4x extended from the supply range of a base on Russian territory.  How do you think that supply mission will go?  

And it's not like it would be over if Russia managed to complete the encirclement.  That would just be the beginning of a new slog as Russia would then have to defend all the miles of perimeter internal and external to the encirclement--They'd have to maintain defenses pointing inward toward the encirclement while also maintaining almost as many miles of front-line against Ukrainian forces outside the encirclement.

7396ffbb5a3824d6040de9055b18a4b3,u0yy7v,i4b01rk,"Yup. There's multiple tanks and a weird leapfroggy thing going on with two completely different platforms and zillions of variants.

From oldest to newest:

1. There are a limited number of T-62 and T-64s in use, mostly from older stocks or in specialist conversions e.g. recovery vehicles. A headache because these are basically antiques plodding around and even the parts for them are old-stock, no longer in production. I believe also some of the DNR and LNR separatists are using them, taken from Ukrainian stock before the 2014 Armed Forces overhaul, which is more headache for Russia to prop up.

2. The bulk of the Russian force is the mass-produced T-72. Within this model, they have a whole range of T-72 variants, which have varying commonality between them, some are more interchangeable than others. Of particular note are the different upgrade groups e.g. 2011 and 2016 which are not the same at all. A whole smorgasbord of different aftermarket/bolt-on electronic warfare packages and labels exist, including T-72A, the incompatible half-dozen different T-72B subgroups (like the T-72B obr. 1990, the T-72B1 family, the B2 obr.2006, the B3 obr.2016) and the T-72BA which somehow combines... multiple different prior upgrades?

3. They are also using, quite heavily, the ""high technology"" (at the time) T-80 which is based upon the T-64 chassis but with a different (turbine) engine that's a headache of its own and despite visual similarities to the T-72 and a shared heritage with the T-64 is almost entirely parts incompatible with either. It was always supposed to be a complimentary counterpart to the T-72 as the workhorse, a similar concept that we see a lot with Soviet ideas (e.g. the WW2 use of both the Mosin-Nagant and SVT-40 as line infantryman and elite rifleman armament, the switch from this to SKS and AK-47 in the same roles, the development in tandem of same-purpose but different-cost airframes) where there is a quantity and a quality option, and one is for the masses and one for the elite troops.

4. They're also fielding limited numbers of the newer T-90, which to go back to the leapfrogging comment I made, is essentially an iteration of the T-72 but with a new identity. As the first tank series to be built in a predominantly post-Soviet world, earlier models make use of parts from supply chains outside the former Warsaw Pact, and earlier models have, for example, optical equipment produced by Thales. Russia claims that later models replaced such internationally sourced parts with Russian built equivalents, but where exactly domestic capability for a fully vertically integrated production of thermal sights comes from, I'm not so sure. It looks like the *optics* are produced in Russia but the chips and subassemblies are still imported. The T-90 is currently undergoing a modernisation program which further muddies and adds to the number of spare parts that logistics chains need to be able to provide, as units in the field are using a mixture of modernised and unmodernised variants. Of note is that despite claims that all the equipment on board a T-90 is domestically produced, Uralvagonzavod have halted production and upgrade programmes due to ""a lack of imported parts"".

5. Oh, and to add insult to injury, Russia is supposed to be formally introducing the T-14 this year. Late and behind schedule. Nothing is being retired, they're just adding it. Except they're not because they can't build them, and even pre-sanctions were struggling with the technology and the parts supplies, as well as politics - Russian politicians pushed back against its introduction because even their oldest in-service tank, the T-72, was selling well internationally and considered to still be a potent and viable military option, and they had thousands of them in stockpiles. Seven T-14s have been seen in parades, there's supposed to be a first production run of 100 being delivered this year. Zero have been seen in Ukraine and there's every suspicion that outside of the parade and prototype tanks, no actual service model tanks exist. Unlike everything else here, the T-14 might actually be a *good* modern tank with several features that are highly modern, such as a completely unmanned and fully automated turret, and a compact, well-protected crew compartment deep inside the hull, increasing survivability even from disabling hits. Still zero of them in service by all accounts, but once they arrive (if they arrive) it's a huge maintenance headache adding yet another platform with zero backwards compatibility or standardisation.",1649691727.0,1649691178.0,t3_u0yy7v,t1_i4aqs8k,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

With small arms, storage is relatively easy and relatively indefinite.

I've seen someone unbox a case of unissued, late war (possibly technically postwar) PPSh submachine guns. Made for the Japan campaign that never happened. This was about a decade and a half ago. Each one in oil and paper, in individually sealed boxes. Not a spot of corrosion, every single one in firing condition following a standard setup from an armourer. No repair work, remediation or anything needed once the storage oil was cleaned away. Genuinely did not look like half century old weapons, they were basically factory new. These were stored under wartime pressure too, not the slower rate of peacetime factories.

You can't exactly do that with a battalion of tanks. Sealed storage might work for a removed engine (and believe me, crated engines are definitely a thing in military stores) but the actual tank hull is outside in the elements.

Likewise, those PPSh SMGs? Sure, ineffective against body armour but just as deadly in 2022 against people as they were in 1945. If it had been a crate of 60s AKMs or 70s AK-74s, then apart from a lack of optics those are perfectly functional on the modern battlefield. You could stick a Warsaw Pact Rail on if it bothers you that much.

Yes, this is genocide. Why? Because rape resulting in forced pregnancies is one of the potential component acts of genocide. Dilution of an ethnic population by mixing with other ethnicities through rape is by definition a method of deliberately destroying that population.

It was a *substantial* part of the genocide in the breakup of Yugoslavia, in which Bosniak women were raped en masse by Serb nationalists.

If anything, the Russian's use of artillery has been mind-boggingly stupid. They're giving Mariupol the Grozny treatment. Do you know what that does?

Every time you fire a gun in the modern battlefield, counter-artillery radar tracks the location of those shells. Even without counter-artillery radar, your soldier-scientists can look at the shape of the holes in the ground, and figure out at least the direction that the shells came in. Craters don't make little circles, they make little **ellipses** into the ground, pointing in the direction that they were fired from.

Using all of this information, you then figure out where the enemy took their shots from, call your allies on the radio and start counter-attacking ASAP.

---------

Russian guns and other artillery emplacements keep getting taken out. I don't know exactly the way that Ukrainian counter-artillery tactics work, but they're clearly doing **SOMETHING** to find those guns and destroy them.

For every shot that the Russians take into civilian areas, is one more shot that the Ukrainians can ""rangefind"" the enemy... through sound, through radar, or in the worst case... through measuring the crater holes in the ground.

Sure, the Russians get off a lot of shots into innocent neighborhoods and kill hundreds (thousands?) of innocent people. But then those guns are tracked down and destroyed.

Suddenly? The war's been going on for almost 7 weeks now, they had plenty of time to plan this Donbas offensive. Sure, if you assume that none of their generals learned from the mistakes made around Kyiv, then yes, there's nothing to worry about, but that's usually not how it works. They've had a lot of time to plan their original invasion too, but that was all theoretical. No plan survives first contact with the enemy or something like that. This time you should expect them to be a lot more organized. 

The Donbas is also a lot easier to supply. They can send troops and supplies from the south, safely from Crimea, from the East through Donbas, which they have been partially occupying for 8 years now. Near Kyiv they attempted to go deep into enemy territory and failed. This time they can be a lot more methodical. They have the region surrounded from 3 sides basically.

yeah - it seems to be a feature, of authoritarian states, that in order to maintain control, one must continue to boost the xenophobic narrative about the ""other"".   

China seems to have done 'fine' just walking the razor's edge between openness, and authoritarian censorship - and I guess that around the time of the Tienanmen Square massacre, and the government/party's reaction, was when they were kind of forced to start suppressing information. They party members were probably very alarmed about the pro-democracy movement, and either out of factual knowledge, or paranoia, they decided that it was really a foreign-run infiltration event, (the pro-democracy movement), and that they had to stop it.

Whether or not that was actually true; the paranoia seems to be a feature of authoritarian systems.

Now, in Russia's case, there is a strong culture of corruption, (likely due to decades under Soviet rule, with a system that was so strictly locked down that it actually caused black markets to flourish).

One plausible scenario as an example, imagine a sizable crater caused by artillery, it's downwind of a gas tank with a small leak and has been slowly filling with a heavier than air gas. Some soldiers are running between positions and take cover in the crater, they don't feel any immediate effects because the gas/air mixture isn't TOO bad. They see the drone fly over them, buzz around in a circle in a clear indication it's aware of them, then flies off. The worry about their position being revealed causes them to breathe harder, pulling more of the gas into their lungs. So now they get up and sprint away from the crater to safety, only something is clearly wrong. They are disoriented and having trouble breathing, etc. It's easy for them to believe the drone had something to do with their situation, when in this example it didn't.

I think their biggest value will be to be able to bring a tank to fight that they had previously not been able to bring a tank to. With the intel advantage Ukraine appears to have, that should let them avoid getting into fights where Russia has more modern tanks.

Most chemical agents are dense and sink to low ground. Mustard and lewisite, for example, have 6.5 times the density of air. These were ideally suited to trench warfare where defenders were made to seek cover by a preparatory HE bombing, then gassed. Mustard only killed 3% of those gassed, pre-antibiotics.

He's under pressure internally due to poor economic performance, so invading Ukraine and securing the Donbas gives him control of newly discovered oil and gas resources.

Russia isn't the only country that does this where the majority of their ""in-service"" equipment is actually stored - the US mothballs *huge* quantities of aircraft and vehicles, and the UK does it too. The difference is that the US stores everything correctly sealed-up and storage-prepped, in a dry, low humidity desert environment, not the rainy, snowy, damp conditions of the Russian far-East. The US definitely doesn't leave engines assembled with oil in, or the turret hatches open to the rain. Russia does. 

The UK stores a lot of stuff on old RAF airbases from WW2 but anything that needs dry conditions goes in the old hangars and storage sheds out of the elements, or at the very least is stripped down and covered over if it can't sit outside. It also cycles what's in storage and how long it's there. It sells off the old stuff rather than keeping it beyond its useful shelf life and just parking newer vehicles in an additional block of parking. Once stuff becomes obsolete or storage conditions become a concern (e.g. multiple winters in the rain) either it's sold or it's scrapped.

Russia's tactic is ""hoard everything, store it in the rain, park it and just leave it, no prep, hope it works"".

The US tactic is ""hoard everything, store it in dry, warm desert, pack it away properly or maintain it in storage""

The UK tactic is ""hoard the last generation, store it in the best conditions possible given limited choices, and once it has been stored too long (depending on whether it's stored indoors or outdoors) sell it off and free up the space for the next cycle"".

Radio Svoboda stated the payments are intended to coerce units withdrawn from the Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Sumy regions to reenter combat. We have previously reported several instances of Russian soldiers refusing orders to return to Ukraine after being pulled back.

>Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. At a 2014 summit, responding to Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO members pledged to meet that guideline by 2024.

>Note the date — that was three years before Trump became president, and a year before he even announced he was running for president. Yet he persistently claims credit for actions that were underway before he became president — and consistently misleads about where NATO funding was headed before he became president.

>For instance, he asserted on Dec. 5: “As you know, NATO was suffering very badly from depletion of funds, and it was going down like a roller coaster goes down. Not up, but down. And I was able to, over the last couple of years, increase their contribution.” On Dec. 3, he even cited looking at a chart: “So NATO, which was really heading in the wrong direction three years ago — it was heading down. If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don’t think they could have gone on much longer.”

>But here’s the chart that NATO [published](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_11/20191129_pr-2019-123-en.pdf) on Nov. 29.

I don't think you understand what I'm saying here, Ukraine has nothing to do with it. They could be fighting over Latvia or Alaska and the result would be the same. 

Your major mistake here is in thinking that human beings are rational. Go to your local Walmart and take an honest look at those fuckers. No they aren't. But that aside you have to understand that a nuclear missile is indistinguishable from any other dot on a radar. War between Russia and NATO produces quite a lot of little dots on radars. 

Nobody ""wants"" nuclear war. But here's another thing people like you clearly don't know about US and Russian nuclear doctrine: the only way to mitigate the damage from a nuclear attack is to destroy the enemy before they can destroy you. As such any indication of a launch, or even of the discussion of whether to launch or not, or even the *suggestion* of launching is going to create an immediate and devastating response. 

The most likely way a nuclear war can start is not a person hitting a button. It is by complete accident. Look up some of the near misses we've had. Seconds from extinction, and you still play games? It's absurdity to think this is impossible. It's naive optimism that will incinerate itself. Optimists are always wrong when it comes to shit like this. In fact when it comes to anything involving armed conflict my legitimate advice to you is to assume there is no hope for anybody. Because trusting in people, trusting in reason, trusting in logic ability to prevail over insanity, that's what actually started the ovens at Auschwitz. 

The moment an American bullet hits anything Russian everybody who isn't a complete idiot will assume that the missiles are coming any moment. To put emphasis on that: you'd have to be a complete idiot to not plan with the worst possible scenario in mind, especially when it is as likely as nuclear war is. 

And yes, *likely*. Again, go look up how close we've come. It is a miracle any of us are breathing. And you are psychotic enough you want to play games with this? 

Preventing open war between NATO and Russia is a matter of the survival of civilization itself. 

Don't preach morality like it has any relevance here, it doesn't. We shoot we die. End of story. You can't help Ukraine by glassing it along with everything else. If you think that won't happen your living in a fantasy. People have done dumber things for worse reasons. People kill each other over parking spots and video games.

Russia is an unreliable narrator, they follow a strategy of ""firehose of disinformation"", they throw so much information around that it casts doubt on any claims. This so far has been sufficient to allow them to deny their many atrocities. They're not good lies, but they've worked ok.

By forensically going through social media, public information and official sources and breaking down each claim the BBC produces evidence for its conclusions which builds trust in the information it is sharing, that helps to combat the ""firehose of disinformation"" and effectively counters the narrative of ""no one really knows the truth"". 

In this situation, it is not possible to independently verify each individual casualty, but by breaking down the demographics of the casualties that have been confirmed by social media the BBC aims to demonstrate why the official Russian casualty numbers are likely incorrect and therefore lends support to the idea that casualty numbers are much higher.

They will pursue this policy in other places, it is all but guaranteed with the pattern of behavior that they have been displaying over the past two decades. 

Russia is able to detect when we launch nuclear missiles, they'll know if we actually intend to attack them with our nuclear arsenal. More importantly they will know when we don't. They know full well that a no fly zone in Ukraine is not a nuclear strike, its not an existential threat. 

The idea that striking first would allow one to be victorious has been outdated since the advent of the nuclear triad. There is no longer even remotely such a thing as a nuclear war without both sides being able to engage in it. 

Appeasers are always wrong with this shit, in the ruins of Europe following the second world war laid bare the complete lie that was the line of thinking that if we simply just concede one more nation or one more genocide then the problem will go away. You have the guts to bring up the butchering of Auschwitz when you would happily doom Ukraine to share the same fate of those rounded up and executed within its fences.

This idea that America holding Russia accountable for its crimes against humanity would force Russia to respond with the full might of its nuclear arsenal is not only wrong, but if it wasn't wrong would only justify Americas actions. Such a nation is an existential threat to the world and must be dealt with as soon as possible.

To you the people who live outside NATO and Russia are simple playthings, they don't get the luxuries of agency or human rights. Putin can rape and murder the children, as long as they are foreign children. 

I expect Russia to act in its own self-preservation. They will not engage in a nuclear war over Ukraine otherwise they lose everything. 

You a monster, who would willingly see the horrors of the holocaust return as long as it meant you had the delusion of safety.
