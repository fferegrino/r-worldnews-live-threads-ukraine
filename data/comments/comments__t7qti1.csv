Really difficult.  The Mariupol it used to be is destroyed.

The occupants have shut down electricity, mobile networks, water utilities. The city is sieged and daily shelled. The hospitals, residential and government buildings are bombed.

There are thousands wounded and killed!

The major of Mariupol is pleading for HELP!

Please share. Here is his interview in Russian. I know many of you do not understand but this is trusted source of information. I have relatives living in Ukraine.

Edited: From what he is saying the russian forces are trying to destroy as much infrastructure, get rid of people so they can have easier connection to Crimea. They already   destroyed a dam built to block the water to Crimea.

While they are stopped they are a much easier target for molotov cocktails.

If an AP transport -- look for a vent (the invaders need to breathe after all) and aim for that.

It is easiest to do so from a higher height, obviously.

EDIT: Might be buried but obviously don't do this alone. If you've got a group of tall buildings around your trap that's ideal -- multiple molotovs available on each side since it's not likely to be one vehicle.

This has all changed. Putin actually created an incentive for the West to crush Russia's economy. We respected Russia's military, but now we know that it's a joke.

While this whole project started as a means for the public to view on-the-ground actual evidence, [the recent announcement of ICC regarding its investigation of the Russian-Ukrainian War](https://www.icc-cpi.int/Pages/item.aspx?name=2022-prosecutor-statement-referrals-ukraine), and subsequent announcement that the public can contribute evidence, means that our project can now officially be used to help the cause of our Ukrainian brothers. We will now start looking for ways to legally submit the gathered evidence to the ICC.

With that in mind, we would need your help to go over our subreddit and corroborate our findings and look for things that we may have missed, and if we do, please contribute to the discourse and reach out to us and we will do our due diligence.

On behalf of our team: u/pocket-seeds, u/micro_bio and u/RG6EX we would like to thank all volunteers and all who would like to help.

It's very expensive to maintain a large arsenal, and since it's main purpose is as a deterrent some might assume that they would never actually have to be used. The threat of nuclear weapons is the main source of their power. Russia just wants foreign nations to believe they can hold up their side of MAD, but might Russia have secretly disabled most of their weapons to save on costs?

Obviously nobody wants to test this theory because Russia definitely has something they could use, perhaps a single tactical strike in a non-NATO conflict which would remind the world of their fears. But could Russia still hit every major American, British and French city and military base, plus the other NATO countries hosting nuclear weapons: Belgium, Germany, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Italy?

As a deterrent a smaller nuclear arsenal would still be effective as the cost of being attacked by even one nuclear bomb is enough to stop most powers from thinking about trying to fight you directly.

If Russians wanted to detonate a nuke in Ukraine the best way to do it would be accusing Ukraine of possessing one, so when it blows, you can blame them. No one would buy it of course, but it would probably prevent NATO from retaliating right away, while making it known for the world that Putin's ready to use nukes, possibly forcing Ukraine to surrender.

How to create a non-NATO #NoFlyZone over #Ukraine, in five steps:

1. Secure a couple of West Ukrainian airports with enough anti-aircraft installations to make them usable.
2. Present Ukraine several dozen decommissioned Western fighter planes (F-14, F-15, F-16, F-18...), and bring them to these West Ukrainian airports.
3. Find several Western dozen volunteer airforce veterans, and give them Ukrainian citizenship.
4. Bring these new Ukrainian citizens to the secured West Ukrainian airports, and appropriate fighter planes re-painted in Ukrainian colors.
5. Let these new #Ukrainian citizens with Ukrainian fighter planes in Ukrainian colors fly sorties from West Ukrainian airports over Ukrainian state territory.

Social democrats must be at the forefront against the foreign policy establishment and those who cry out for increased tensions and defense spending. To do otherwise only invites disaster.

The first war was preceded by the Russian Intervention in Ichkeria, in which Russia tried to covertly overthrow the Ichkerian government. After the initial campaign of 1994‚Äì1995, culminating in the devastating Battle of Grozny, Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya, but faced heavy resistance from Chechen guerrillas and raids on the flatlands.

The feature-length film was based on an earlier 2013 short film by the same name, funded through the Scottish Documentary Institute's Bridging the Gap programme. The film was the last programme broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel's first day on air and was rebroadcast on the same channel on 4 May and 20 October 2019 and on 21 November 2020.

Putin is so worried he went as far as saying the ""nuke"" word. It is still his number one worry, taking every chance he gets to threaten anyone who thinks about it.

A man so scared of COVID he sits at the end of a 40ft table is not about to commit suicide by launching nukes at the US or a NATO country. But if he thinks he has everyone scared enough, he may use a tactical nuke in Ukraine to ""win"" the war, expecting zero retaliation because people will still not want to risk a global nuclear war.

A lot of people here have fallen for his buff. Screaming that NATO and the US should not get involved in direct military action against him, because ""omg nukes"". Those people might as well have Putins arm up their ass, because it is exactly want Putin wants you to believe.

Putin wants you to believe that a global nuclear war will kick off if NATO or the US get directly involved, he wants you to believe he is a unhinged madman ready to press the button.

As Russia operates under a federal system made up of 85 federal subjects, any Balkanization would likely occur along these lines, breaking up the country' states all into their own countries or groupings of States becoming countries. 

The mostly likely for this to happen to is what's called the Republics of Russia. Since the time of the USSR, Russia has contained a series of ""republics"" which are part of Russia, however are nominally independent and so have their own governments and elections, although varying levels of independence. Think Chechnya, and Crimea falls under this as well. The idea of these, is that region's of the country which are populated by mostly non Russians have their own administration. Putin since coming to power has completely stripped all of them, bar Chechnya of any power or autonomy. 

Realistically Balkanization would start through the release of these 22 Russian Republics as independent countries, due to them each having a didn't non Russian ethnic makeup, then following that, the remaining 63 Russian federal subjects would be reorganised into a new country or series of countries, but what that would look like I'm not sure.",False,1646557757.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzk0zz8,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

What that says to Russia is the threat of war with the west is the only thing which gets results and modifies behaviour. So yeah, of course they will threaten war over sanctions, probably increasingly stridently as the toll of the sanctions mounts and they face social unrest. 

The weird thing is..for a leader like putin  the sanctions probably actually are more provocative than direct intervention in ukraine. A no fly zone limited to Ukraine is not a direct threat to Putin's rule, worst case scenario, some russian planes over Ukraine get shot down and their invasion collapses without air support. It doesn't change things at home, and in a purely pragmatic sense, he russian government's existence isn't threatened by a few dead pilots, not when they are already losing thousands of soldiers to (western supplied) anti tank and anti aircraft missiles.

Meanwhile, sanctions are directly targetted at Russia's domestic society. They aim to generate sufficient economic suffering that the fear of social unrest will cause the russian government to pull out of ukraine- or be overthrown. So they are a measure which if pursued has the potential to directly jeopardise the existence of the russian state. In the long term they are probably far more of an existential threat to the current Russian government than a no fly zone, and more likely to lead to Putin being overthrown if public misery in Russia gets to great.

So yeah, I worry NATO has got it completely arse about here- they've reasoned that shooting down russian planes over ukraine = unacceptably provocative whilst imposing sanctions intended to cause the overthrow of the Putin government = acceptable response, but they are thinking about it like democracies - they  value human life more than putin, they find use of force far more provocative than putin does, and they aren't scared of their own people the way putin is.",False,1646548950.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzjpiup,,1,-1,0,-1,0,0,

It is often tempting to look upon Vladimir Putin as the millennium bug in a human and deadly form. 

The Russian president rose to power on 31 December 1999, as the world held its breath that computers would go into meltdown when the clock struck midnight, unable to process the change from 1999 to 2000. 

In the 20 years since, Putin has been trying to engineer a different kind of global system malfunction, the destruction of the liberal international order. The former KGB spymaster wanted to turn back the clock: to revive Russia's tsarist greatness and to restore the might and menace of the Soviet Union prior to its break-up in 1991. 

This Russian revanchist has become the most disruptive international leader of the 21st Century, the mastermind behind so much misery from Chechnya to Crimea, from Syria to the cathedral city of Salisbury. He has sought - successfully at times - to redraw the map of Europe. 

He has tried - successfully at times - to immobilise the United Nations. He has been determined - successfully at times - to weaken America, and hasten its division and decline.

>Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake.

Putin made plans that relied on a stupid person, and it was a costly mistake.  (Granted it's becoming more difficult to consider Putin a non-stupid person at this point.  Cipolla meant something very specific by that; prior to the invasion, I think most people's impression of Putin is that he's what Cipolla would call a bandit.)

somewhere in Putin's calculus he did not see good odds in his position getting stronger in his lifetime.  The US, Can, uk and germany were all dealing with divions mainly stemming from covid,  but the pandemic is winding down and becoming endemic.  Canadian vaccine mandates were expiring.  US vaccine mandates failed, and would likely be mostly obsolete soon and not pushed again.  with this division starting to heal, those countries would start to grow again (look at the US jobs reports), while russia, bogged down with sanction would languish.

b36524ad3623d33cf69edc5893d2937e,t7qti1,hzjobaw,"From what I can gather on the Internet - probably only a couple years if you do absolutely no maintenance... give or take some other concerns.

Most of the nuclear ingredients of weapons are actually pretty stable. Lithium and deuterium (the main fusion fuel in a hydrogen bomb) are stable, and most isotopes of uranium and plutonium have quite long half-lives (thousands or millions of years) as long as they aren't allowed to go supercritical.

The important exception is tritium (hydrogen-3), which is used in ""boosted"" weapons - which is probably all of them at this point, based on what the US and UK have said about their arsenals. Tritium undergoes fusion reliably at fairly low temperatures, and gives off a flood of neutrons when it does, working like lighter fluid for the main ingredients. Tritium *does* have a fairly short shelf-life, and is also extremely expensive to produce, so if the Russians are skimping on anything, it's probably that. If you don't replace the tritium, it decays to helium-3, which actually makes your nuke *less* effective (because it can absorb neutrons to become helium-4, thereby dampening the chain reaction, whereas tritium is intended to give off neutrons when it fuses). Without boosting, a fission warhead might go [from 100 kilotons of TNT to 0.3kilotons](https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Uk/UKArsenalRecent.html), and a fusion warhead designed to rely on a boosted-fission trigger might not really ignite at all. I'm not sure exactly how frequently the tritium needs to be cycled - it's not exactly something the nuclear powers broadcast, and in the case of the US you can't even look at budget sheets to estimate, because we've gotten a lot of what we need for maintenance from decommissioning excess or older warheads - but with a half-life of only 12 years, you'd presumably need to ""top off"" a lot more frequently than that.

Even if the nuclear material isn't ""flat"", you have everything else to think about - the electronics, the rocket fuel, the launch mechanism, the high explosives used to start the detonation, etc. Depending on when and how well they were built, and what conditions they've been kept in, any of those things might have shelf lives less than a decade - and keep in mind they're being *kept in the presence of radioactive materials for long periods of time*, which isn't great for most electronics or reactive chemicals.

That said, I'm not sure how much better any of that makes me sleep. The Soviets might have kept some older unboosted-fission bombs around, which would still be extremely dangerous. They might prioritize the nuclear arsenal over the rest of the army, staffing it with better-paid and better-watched people who are less likely to grift. Even if the bomb fails to go off at full yield, 300 tons of TNT, while insignificant on the scale of nuclear war, is still enough to level a few city blocks, and then you've got a lot of nuclear material strewn about giving people cancer. Most importantly, if nukes *do* start flying, it won't stop with Russia launching theirs. It takes time for missiles to fly around the world, so American (and French, and British, and Israeli) missiles will be on their way to Russia before we know whether or not the Russian missiles were duds. The fallout from the return strike will be a huge problem for most of the world even if you don't get hit. And then there's the wildcard powers - which direction will China's missiles be flying in that scenario? Pakistan's? North Korea's?",1646547782.0,1646546585.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzjhu4q,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

> Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike?  Yes.  Not for military purposes (it will not give anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others.  At the same time, the soil is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging the earth to prove that they secretly created nuclear weapons there.  Damn, they are now hammering on what we have long studied and dismantled: you can‚Äôt draw evidence here on your knee, and the presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is nothing.  There the production cycle is such that you can‚Äôt do it imperceptibly.  You can‚Äôt even make a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù bomb imperceptibly, but the fact that their old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (plants like REB-1000 produce it in minimal quantities as a ‚Äúby-product‚Äù of the reaction) - so the Americans introduced such control there with the involvement of the IAEA, that  sucking on the topic is stupid.",False,1646556878.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzk1gog,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Invoking Article V requires a unanimous decision of all NATO Member States, so if one of them attacks another, it is pretty sure they will veto Article V.

But... An unprovoked attack would be a violation of the UN Charter. Since the NATO Treaty specifically refers to the UN Charter, this would be ground to expel the aggressor from NATO after which Article could be invoked.

However... The NATO Treaty states that an attack on one nation must be considered an attack on all of them, IT DOES NOT SPECIFY MILITARY ACTION.
So, in practice, most countries would file a diplomatic complaint and look the other way.

Turkey and Greece have had plenty of armed skirmishes and everyone looked the other way after filing a complaint."" - Thierry Etienne Joseph Rotty, Senior Controller at NATO

Since the 70‚Äôs with the energy crisis and the loss of the Vietnam war, there has been this notion that the US is ‚Äúweakening.‚Äù  Yet, to date, it has not happened.  The US economically and militarily continue to excel.  Part of the perception of the US ‚Äúweakening‚Äù is due to a decline in soft power and developing countries catching up.  The decline in soft power is in large part due to the lack of a rival.  When there was a competing superpower, the USSR, many countries had to pick a side.  This meant that the US had significant soft power with the countries that sided with them.  After the collapse of the USSR, countries were able to drift away without fear of an opposing force.  Now with Russia‚Äôs recent antics and the rise of China, we will probably see the US regaining soft power in numerous countries that don‚Äôt want to align with China.  The other cause is that the standard of living is improving in many developing countries.  This has narrowed the gap, but it doesn‚Äôt mean the US is in decline.   

Case in point, look at the renewed strength of NATO and the West in the face of the Russian invasion.  We finally had an opponent again that threatened Europe.  The US has lead the charge in dropping a shit storm of pain upon Russia.  

As for China‚Äôs ascent, China‚Äôs economy is tightly coupled with the West.  If we do bad so do they.   China also has a huge debt problem.  Once you factor in their off-the-books debt and their state-owned corporate debt their debt ratio could be over 300% of their GDP (and that is their stated GDP, not their actual), where as, the US is about 120% (Covid pushed it over ~100%).    Also China is facing a huge graying population problem that makes the US‚Äôs baby boomer crisis pale in comparison.  Militarily, while China is a large regional power, they are not yet a global superpower beyond their nuclear arsenal.  They have a large air force and navy, but they do not yet have the capacity to project that force globally. They have a number of factors impeding their military.  One of the largest being they are surrounded on all sides by hostile countries including their frenemy, Russia.  They also have large sections of occupied territory within their own borders.

*A proposal to suspend the federal gas tax through the end of the year has been met with nearly universal criticism from transportation groups, who argue it would undermine the new infrastructure law.*  
  
*The gas tax bill, introduced by six Senate Democrats ‚Äî four facing reelection in November ‚Äî would cut the excise tax on gasoline produced, imported or sold from 18.4 cents per gallon to zero until Jan. 1, 2023.*  
  
*It would apply only to the federal gas tax, but not to the 24.4 cents per gallon tax on diesel used for trucks, buses and boats, so those in the supply chain industry would not see cost cuts.*  
  
*Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday blasted that omission, saying not including diesel was ""a slap in the face to truckers and a further burden on the supply chain.""*  
  
*He called the proposal ""half-baked,"" and noted that the proposed suspension would expire ""right after the midterms, as soon as the next Congress is sworn in.""*

They would have been expected to take the likes of Kharkiv, Kherson, Sumy, Chirnihiv and Odessa in the first 2 or 3 days of this invasion. Reality is they've lost probably close to 10% of their personnel, thousands of vehicles, their air force is being picked off more and more, their remaining troops are seeing their annihilated friends laying on the road when they advance which kills morale, they are starting, they are out of fuel, they are blocked from travelling in some roads because of their friends destroyed vehicles acting as road blocks and they then have to go off road to get around and becoming stuck in mud in a lot of areas and on top of all of this, it's about to get a whole lot worse. 

They are still fighting over cities close to where the invasion began on all fronts. What do you think happens when they start to try and push north from Kherson? Exactly what has happened for 2 days now, there is stronger resistance on the ground and the Ukrainian air force can get involved easier with bombing because they are further from anti air vehicles closer to crimea. Same in the north, the closer you get to kyiv the stronger the resistence. Kyiv is very likely the most highly defended city in the world right now.

The NFZ isn't essential to the sustained existence of the Ukranian state at this time, it might be in the future. It might also be enough of a threat once Russia has paid a heavy price for their invasion, to force peace where it might not be now. There also unfortunately must be things left on the table to further dissuade a nuclear state from say attacking NATO.

Right now I do not think an NFZ is prudent, worth the risk of escalation, or anywhere near peak efficiency. I think we should push forward on Poland supplying aircraft to Ukraine, giving money for more drones, and other anti aircraft/armor.

1. Most modern explosives are pretty inert unless you are actively trying to make them explode. They are unlikely to become volatile over time as well.
2. The triggering mechanism needs to be enabled (arming the weapon) for there to be a risk of it exploding.
3. Older explosives and older triggering mechanisms may be more inclined to do things you dont expect or want. Degraded explosive material, depending on what it is, may become unstable. Degraded triggering mechanisms may permit an explosive to be armed without anyone intending it to be. Some of the Russian gear is definitely old - but its unlikely to be so old that this is a serious concern (theyve been using their munitions in wars for decades, I do not think it likely to be soviet leftovers).
4. If a bomb is dropped on purpose but doesnt explode, you have a serious risk. This is why you see explosives experts building sandbag walls around explosives they've found and blowing them up - its the safest thing to do, because even trying to move it could cause it to explode.
5. As you may expect, falling out of the sky may damage or destroy a piece of electronics or mechanical equipment, such as the triggering mechanisms in an explosive. It would be wiser to treat such a thing as a potential risk.

As an example, the US once accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb on its own territory (well, actually, its done this a [lot](https://www.atomicarchive.com/almanac/broken-arrows/index.html)). It did not explode. But a lot of the things that were there to stop it from exploding didn't fair very well.

this just published but as of yet unverified analysis from a FSB agent goes into the unrealistic nature of claiming Ukraine is developing a dirty bomb. Perhaps this explains partly why RUS has targeted the nuclear power plants...

>At the same time the ground is being prepared to turn everything over to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging the ground to prove that they have nuclear weapons secretly being built there.

>They are hammering on what we have studied and analysed on bones long time ago: the proofs cannot be drawn up on a whim, and the availability of specialists and uranium (Ukraine is full of depleted isotope 238) is of no importance. **The production cycle there is such that it cannot be done unnoticed**. The fact that their old NPPs can give weapon-grade plutonium (stations like REB-1000 give it in minimum quantities as a ""by-product"" of the reaction) - so the Americans have introduced **such control with involvement of the IAEA that it's silly to discuss the topic.**

And I'm not just saying that, I happend to know *a lot* about radiation because I have worked in the field. So how do I quickly relay *why* this isnt a thing, without getting too technical? 

&nbsp;

I'll give it a shot. Ukraine has *4* major nuclear plants in addition to the Chernobyl complex. They have nuclear waste disposal sites at all of these *in addition* to multiple other waste disposal sites elsewhere in country, located away from the actual nuclear plants. So, how do you produce a ""dirty bomb""? Its staggeringly easy. All you need is a very large bomb (and Ukraine is *littered* with ammunition storages, and has domestic explosive and ammunition production), and a relatively small amount of high potency nuclear isotopes. Like nuclear waste, or nuclear production plant fissionable material. Then you blow your bomb, and the explosion scatters the isotope material into highly radioactive pieces ranging from grain of sand size to larger chunks and flings it everywhere into the immediate blast zone, and further through dust cloud and wind. 

&nbsp;

The **idea** is that its a terror weapon. You have to have geiger counters to even know where its safe to stand and go (which the general population doesnt have), and since fragments are also tiny, a clean-up is extremely complex. Everyone fears radiation. It creates panic, because an invisible threat is there that can kill you, and you could indeed be *breathing in* highly radioactive particles. In all practicality it will render an area unliveable for years even with active measures to clean up.

&nbsp;

Now, Ukraine has been at war with Russia since 2014 and were under no illusion that the situation was anything but that in reality. They've had easy access to material to produce such bombs all these years, and still have it readily available. They could make one in less than 24 hours easily. So when you hear Russia talking about ""trying to build a dirty bomb"" its a statement meant to mislead and misdirect and play on fear. Its also mostly a weapon effective as I said like a terror weapon, inside densely populated cities. It wouldnt work as an area denial weapon, because armed forces are prepared for waging war in contaminated places. They have detection gear and they have protection gear. (NBC-prepated vehicles, gas masks to filter particles, mobile decontamination stations etc). Ukraine isnt fighting cities in Russia. They are fighting to defend their own. If you blow a dirty bomb in a city **you** are defending, it most of all harms **your** civillians. They also know that the international reaction if they were caught in using a dirty bomb, would be the immediate stop of any international support, and universal condemnation. 

So..

* Ukraine could produce a dirty bomb at any given time, and have had the ability since they became independent from the USSR.

* A dirty bomb would not work in defence

* A dirty bomb used against Russia would kill any international support Ukraine has.

* Ukraine is not ""trying"" to build a nuclear bomb, because a 13 year old with access to internet and the materials Ukraine has could do so in an day or two.

* The response to a dirty bomb used by the ukrainians would almost certainly be nuclear, but this time its not so sure the response would be international condemnation or even help

Simple logic and that knowledge tells you this is pure and utter propaganda, or lets just call it by its right name; lies, by Russia to play on the fear of nuclear weapons.",1646554628.0,1646554298.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzjqn7r,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

It's spread out over a variety of fronts which cover hundreds, if not thousands of square km.  These deaths might be spread out in small groups of 5-6.

Internet coverage is pretty spotty in many areas due to the war, and the Ukrainian government has been urging secrecy lately to avoid giving away Ukrainian military movements. The Snapchat heatmap for Ukraine died off basically around day 3-4.

Many bodies are likely burned/blown up, given the number of tanks and other equipment that Ukraine has been destroying. This can make it harder to count but also less likely to be seen even on sites like Reddit.

The number is probably slightly inflated for moral reasons. Ukraine will probably report high (for morale reasons, soldiers misreporting deaths, estimated deaths, etc), Russia will report low (to try and keep morale high). Real answer is somewhere in between.

Finally, it's not like every soldier or civilian is filming the carnage. Obviously some are, but I'd wager most aren't.

**Geopolitical Tier 2 take:** This invasion is all the west and NATOs fault, Putin needed to invade to stop Ukraine joining NATO.  
  
**Geopolitical Tier 3 take:** Hang on now, it seems like there are other reasons: Ukraine has natural gas which just happened to be discovered a bit before 2014 and just happened to be mostly in Crimea which Putin annexed, and Donbass where he started a civil war, not suspicious at all. Putin has also spoken on many occasions of revanchism and missing a Russian imperium, he very obviously wants at least a puppet president in Ukraine just like Belarus and does not want a free wealthy democratic Ukraine which might cause democracy to spread to other nearby countries. Russia is facing a population collapse and having an extra 40 million people would be helpful in dealing with the massive problems that causes.  
  
**Geopolitical Tier 4 take:** NATO expansionism was de facto dead after 2014. First Ukraine didn't meet Nato joining requirements, due to ongoing conflict, corruption, and its poor democracy, and wasn't on a realistic trajectory to fix those things. Second because Germany, Turkey and Italy did not want to piss off their gas supplier ‚ÄúThere are a lot of European Allies who were dead set against inviting Ukraine because they had hopes that they could develop a closer relationship with Moscow.‚Äù. And third because America doesn't want to be busy with this shit in Europe's backyard when it is trying to focus on the Pacific and China which is the main reason it left Afghanistan.  
  
NATO can't announce a public ban on Ukraine which Putin demanded since it has an open door policy and would require consensus to break that policy (Poland would never agree to that) it would also make NATO look like shit. But it would have been very easy to get private guarantees from members on top of everything else that Ukraine would not join NATO (joining requires consensus). It seems likely that Macron offered this to Putin in one of their meetings considering how France viewed NATO, and Macron coming away frustrated from these meetings was likely because Putin denied him. Many other countries almost certainly offered Putin this.  
  
Putin used Ukraine joining NATO as a convenient excuse, very typical of Putin's psyop mind games. He knew perfectly well Ukraine joining NATO was basically impossible after 2014. This is why he made unreasonable demands of NATO such as moving all NATO troops east of Germany back to west Germany, absurd demands asked because he knew NATO couldn't fulfil them. NATO not being able to fulfil them makes his invasion seem more reasonable and masks his true reasons.

Largely for this reason, the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis, it seems, should have drawn all the attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining.


But there were even bigger problems. Then they decided to push Erdogan into 4 pipes of the South Stream and entered Syria - this is after Soleimani gave deliberately false inputs in order to solve his problems. 

As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with the Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung with another headache (if we go out, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it‚Äôs also difficult and useless to sit).


I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian Blitzkrieg"". If we were given real introductory information, we would at least indicate that the original plan is controversial, that we need to double-check a lot. A lot of things. Now we got into the shit somewhere up to the neck. And it is not clear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not analytical categories, because they do not have clearly defined parameters by which one can determine the level of accomplishment or non-completion of the task.



Now it remains to be seen that some fucking adviser will convince the top to start a conflict with Europe demanding to reduce some sanctions. Or reduce, or war. What if they refuse? Now I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like Hitler in 1939. And then our Z will be compared to us with a swastika.


Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it will not give anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others. At the same time, the soil is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging the earth to prove that they secretly created nuclear weapons there. Damn, they are now hammering on what we have long studied and dismantled: you can‚Äôt draw evidence here on your knee, and the presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is nothing. There the production cycle is such that you can‚Äôt do it imperceptibly. You can‚Äôt even make a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù bomb imperceptibly, but the fact that their old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (plants like REB-1000 produce it in minimal quantities as a ‚Äúby-product‚Äù of the reaction) - so the Americans introduced such control there with the involvement of the IAEA, that sucking on the topic is stupid.


Do you know what will happen next week? Well, even after two. Now it will cover us so much that we will start to miss the hungry 90s. While the auction was closed, Nabiullina seemed to be taking normal steps - but this is all like plugging a hole in a dam with a finger. It will still break through, and even stronger. Nothing will be decided in 3, 5, or 10 days.


Kadyrov beats his hoof for a reason - they have their own adventures there. He created for himself the image of the most influential and invincible. And if it falls once, it will be taken down by its own people. He will no longer be the owner of the winning teip.


We go further. Syria. ""The guys will hold out, everything will be over in Ukraine - and there in Syria we will again strengthen everything in positions."" And now, at any moment, they can wait there for the contingent to run out of resources - and such a heat will set in ... Turkey blocks the straits - to transport supplies there by planes, it's like heating an oven with money.


Notice that all this is happening at the same time, we don‚Äôt even have time to bring everything into one heap. We have a situation, like in Germany in the 43-44th. At the start right away. Sometimes I am already lost from this overwork, sometimes it seems that everything was a dream and it was a dream, that everything is as before.
In prisons, by the way, it will be worse. Now the nuts will begin to tighten so that to the bloody ichor. Everywhere.


To be honest, purely technically, this remains the only chance to keep the situation - we are already in the mode of total mobilization. But you can‚Äôt stay in such a regime for a long time, and we have ambiguity with the timing and it will only get worse for now. From mobilization, management always goes astray. Yes, and imagine: you can run a hundred meters in a snatch, but it‚Äôs bad to go to a marathon distance and give a jerk with all your might. Here we rushed with the Ukrainian question, as if we were running a hundred meters, and fit into a cross-country marathon.
And that's what I'm talking about very, very briefly.



From the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that VV Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.

Firstly, there is more than one person making a decision, at least someone will jump off. And there are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".

Secondly, there are some doubts that everything is functioning successfully there. Experience shows that the greater the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. And where it is not clear who controls and how, but always bravura reports - everything is always wrong there. I'm not sure if the red button system works as advertised. In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.


Thirdly, and this is the most vile and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the readiness to sacrifice oneself of a person who does not let the members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers, come close to him. For fear of the coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter. If you are afraid to let the most trusted people near you, then how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones, inclusive?

They have a political caste system. The leader can do no wrong, and the blame goes to his governors solely for any failures.

Russians love a leader who can lie with strategy, even if their populace knows they are lying. They won't say anything because they know the lie is part of a bigger plot.

Russians believe they should suffer to achieve their goals.

Corruption is encouraged to get ahead. Theft is encouraged. But not *too much* theft.

Russians have painted themselves as a castle that is being surrounded by NATO/American Imperialism. They think we're going to destroy them or invade them since historically, other empires have done so in the past.

Russians want their populace to suffer so the leadership can blame it on American Imperialism. It will not be the fault of the leadership for their suffering.

It means that their entire logistical network is based around those aircraft. Months/years of stored parts for maintenance. The training of EVERYONE from pilots to mechanics is based on those Migs.

If we just hand them F-16s, they can't even safely fly them for months them while their pilots and ground crews get crash courses in a completely different architecture. Which means every plane they trade is one less plane they have if Putin suddenly decides to attack Poland for some insane reason.

It is perfectly reasonable for Poland to require a fully fleshed out procurement deal whereby the US commits to funding the training of all the relevant people, supplies the spare parts for a time, etc. Because if they take the deal then for whatever reason we tell them ""Oh, sorry, we can't actually sell you parts."" then they are fucked.

Some economists even peddled the theory that recessions would be no more, partly because of the productivity gains of the new digital economy. It was also thought that globalisation, and the interdependence it wrought, would stop major economic powers fighting wars. The same utopianism attached itself to the internet, which was seen overwhelmingly as a force for global good.

In the early days especially, the same misplaced optimism and wishful thinking coloured the west's approach to Putin - a figure, it is now obvious, who was trying to buck history and thwart democratisation, however many lives were lost in the process. 

Successive US presidents have played into his hands. Bill Clinton, the occupant of the White House when Putin came to power, handed this ultra-nationalist a popular grievance by pushing for the expansion of Nato right up to Russia's borders.

 >The Normandy landings were the landing operations and associated airborne operations on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of France (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front. Planning for the operation began in 1943.
 
**[Atlantic Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall)** 
 
 >The Atlantic Wall (German: Atlantikwall) was an extensive system of coastal defences and fortifications built by Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944 along the coast of continental Europe and Scandinavia as a defence against an anticipated Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe from the United Kingdom, during World War II. The manning and operation of the Atlantic Wall was administratively overseen by the German Army, with some support from Luftwaffe ground forces. The Kriegsmarine (German Navy) maintained a separate coastal defence network, organised into a number of sea defence zones.

This is such nonsense. Its not a video game where the waves of troops gradually increase in power.

Russia wanted a rapid, overwhelming victory in Ukraine, as quickly as possible with as few casualties as possible to minimise international blowback and present the world with a fait accompli before sanctions could bite and the spring thaw made much of the country impassable.

Russia was doing their best to replicate the second gulf war campaign- with highly mobile columns, surgical air strikes and aggressive action to seize strategic locations and cut off the ukrainian army- in those circumstances its insane to think they wouldn't committed their best available troops to that first effort. They tried everything to sieze Kiev and Kherson in the first few days of the invasion-, they just failed miserably.

I think the biggest military weakness Russia has shown is systemic- even if individual units like their paratroopers and spetnatz were capable fighters their total inability to coordinate air and ground forces, or have different units to exploit opportunities or support each other has made this an absolute cluster fuck. 

At the end of the day no matter how elite your infantry are, if you send them  alone and unsupported into a hostile city in light vehicles, they're going to get bbqed by anti tank missiles just the same as conscripts.

 >The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing war primarily involving Russia, pro-Russian forces, and Belarus on one side, and Ukraine and its international supporters on the other. Conflict began in February 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity, and focused on the status of Crimea and parts of the Donbas, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The conflict includes the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014), the war in Donbas (2014‚Äìpresent), naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and political tensions. Intentionally concealing its involvement, Russia gave military backing to separatists in the Donbas from 2014 onwards.

 >A dirty bomb or radiological dispersal device is a speculative radiological weapon that combines radioactive material with conventional explosives. The purpose of the weapon is to contaminate the area around the dispersal agent/conventional explosion with radioactive material, serving primarily as an area denial device against civilians. It is, however, not to be confused with a nuclear explosion, such as a fission bomb, which by releasing nuclear energy produces blast effects far in excess of what is achievable by the use of conventional explosives.

(He *is* pulling troops from the east, just as he pulled them from Finland.)

But then I see comments like this, about how many more troops he probably has, and that Ukraine isn't actually *winning*, just losing slowly, and other comments (and outside info from what seem to be reputable sources) that at best it's probably going to be a draw, with part of Ukraine annexed and a bloody Afghanistan-type war for years.

So, which is it - is the Russia military *really* this weak and incompetent, and I'm a tin-hat wearing fool - or is it still pretty bad-ass, at least in numbers, and is going to keep grinding Ukraine down?

 >The Czech hedgehog (Czech: rozsoch√°ƒç or je≈æek) is a static anti-tank obstacle defense made of metal angle beams or I-beams (that is, lengths with an L- or …™-shaped cross section). The hedgehog is very effective in keeping light to medium tanks and vehicles from penetrating a line of defense; it maintains its function even when tipped over by a nearby explosion. Although Czech hedgehogs may provide some scant cover for infantry, infantry forces are generally much less effective against fortified defensive positions than mechanized units.

The theory seems pretty solid when applied to weaker nations: For example, the Iran Deal included sunset provisions to certain repeated checks by the IAEA of their nuclear facilities to ensure they weren't enriching uranium beyond the low single digit percentage concentration used for nuclear energy.  Why be so confident they won't just pick up where they left off when certain provisions sunset? Because other parts of the deal would have helped integrate their economy with the west, putting leverage in the hand of the west if Iran dare restart their nuclear weapons program.  The same levers we see used against Russia today, pulling out all facets of western integrated economic institutions in one fell swoop.

However, with China, it seems like they have leverage over us based on their size. For example, movies never have Chinese ""bad guys."" This is because China is a massive movie market for Hollywood, and they wouldn't dare restrict a movie from the get go. Additionally, China would likely find a problem with it immediately and ban all further movies produced by that film company. Another is the NBA, particularly felt around the NBAs distancing from the Chinese dismantlement of Hong Kong democracy. Lebron's anti-Hong Kong comments come to mind.

 >In political jargon, a useful idiot is a derogatory term for a person perceived as propagandizing for a cause without fully comprehending the cause's goals, and who is cynically used by the cause's leaders. The term was originally used during the Cold War to describe non-communists regarded as susceptible to communist propaganda and manipulation. The term has often been attributed to Vladimir Lenin, but this attribution has not been substantiated.

The Polish Block 52+ F-16s are equipped with the latest Pratt and Whitney F-100-229 afterburning turbofan engines, and the avionics suite includes the APG-68(V)9 terrain mapping radar system and the ALQ-211(V)4 electronic warfare suite.

""I looked the man in the eye,"" Bush famously said after their first meeting in Slovenia in 2001. ""I found him very straightforward and trustworthy‚Ä¶ I was able to get a sense of his soul."" Bush mistakenly thought he could mount a charm offensive with Putin, and gently cajole him further down the democratic path. 

But even though Bush visited Russia more than any other country - including, as a personal favour, two trips in 2002 to Putin's home city, St Petersburg - the Russian leader was already displaying dangerously despotic tendencies. 

In 2008, Bush's final year as president, Putin invaded Georgia - what he called a ""peace enforcement operation"". The Kremlin argued then - and has continued to argue ever since - that it was hypocritical for Washington to complain about this violation of international law after Bush had invaded Iraq. 

Barack Obama sought to reframe US-Russian relations. His first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, even handed her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov a mock reset button (which was mistakenly labelled with the Russian word for ""overloaded""). But Putin knew that America, after its long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer wanted to police the world. 

When Obama refused in 2013 to enforce his red-line warning against Bashar al-Assad when the Syrian dictator used chemical weapons against his own people, Putin saw a green light. By helping Assad carry out his murderous war, he extended Moscow's sphere of influence in the Middle East when the United States wanted to extract itself from the region. The following year, he annexed Crimea, and established a foothold in eastern Ukraine. 

Despite being told by Obama to ""cut it out,"" Putin even sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the hope that Hillary Clinton, a long-time nemesis, would be defeated and that Donald Trump, a long-time fan boy, would win.

The New York property tycoon made no secret of his admiration for Putin, a sycophantic approach that seems to have further emboldened the Russian president. Much to Moscow's delight, Trump publicly criticised Nato, weakened the US post-war alliance system and became such a polarising figure that he left America more politically divided than at any time since the Civil War.",False,1646566734.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzke994,,3,9,0,9,0,0,

Perhaps, but even the largest bomb ever tested would ""only' have a thermal radiation radius of about 60km (a little under 40 miles).

Windows and weaker structures would break at a distance of ~54km (~33mi), Most residential buildings would collapse (and possibly catch fire) as far as ~21km (13 mi), but sturdier structures would remain standing, and everything within ~9km (~6mi) would be essentially rubble.

Fallout would of course be a problem for anyone downwind, and could possibly exceed 10 rad/hr up to 122km (75 mi) away, though only in a relatively narrow corridor. At this rate, acute radiation sickness is unlikely, though immune and blood problems are likely to occur, and of course rates of cancer would notably go up over a life time.

Dosages up to 1 rad/hr are likely to occur further away than that (that's essentially the radiation dose of getting a CT scan once every hour) - most likely rates of cancer would notably tick up, probably to the single digits of percentages (keep in mind, while the percentage is low, multiplied over thousands are millions of people, it would be a lot of cancer.)

""Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"".

 >No first use (NFU) refers to a pledge or a policy by a nuclear power not to use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons. This concept is also applied to chemical and biological warfare in case of the NFU policy of India. NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy. During the lifetime of the Soviet Union it argued that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in the Eurasian land mass.

It's possible Russia can send a large fraction of the rest of that and/or activate those reserves for a second wave. It's also possible that much of those tanks aren't maintained to the point where they're useful in combat. I've seen creditable sources say both things.

And for the west to make such a bluff it could jeopardize the security of NATO countries, because if you say that you will defend a country (or imply that you will) and then when that country gets attacked you do nothing, why would all your other promises of defense (like article 5 of NATO) mean anything anyway?

What i'm saying is that if the US were to make that promise, and Putin called it a bluff, the consequences for the US and NATO would be far greater than simply losing Ukraine.

And keep in mind, if the US were to imply that it would involve itself directly in a war in Ukraine, it likely would not have gotten the support of several NATO countries. Remember, Germany wasn't even allowing weapons that were being delivered to Ukraine to pass through their airspace, you think they would go along with US implying that they would go in directly to defend Ukraine? Hell no, they would distance themselves from those promises pretty quickly. Thus creating disunity within NATO and weakening its resolve.

This is the delicate balance that the west was playing, how to unite against Russia but do so in a way that didn't jeopardize the very alliance that protects them.

And just so i make my point clear, i think the steps that the US and its allies are taking now, are the steps that they should have taken in 2014. The annexation of Crimea and the subsequent war in the east of Ukraine, should have given plenty of ammunition for the west to cut all ties to the Russian economy back then.",1646554414.0,1646553849.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzjvli4,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Mearsheimer is best known for developing the theory of offensive realism, which describes the interaction between great powers as being primarily driven by the rational desire to achieve regional hegemony in an anarchic international system.

A recent article was posted on Tass arguing that during WW2 all countries in Europe just rolled over and collaborated with the Axis (clearly an attempt to explain why Europe supports a supposed fascist Ukraine). And while there certainly were collaborators, even more so against the USSR, it's completely revisionist. The USSR were making deals with the Germans to partition the Polish, who fought against the Germans to end, all the while the French and British were in a state of war.

Most Russian news is currently claiming that Ukraine was building nukes. One of the arguments is that the US was sending plutonium, which it was. Ukraine was in the process of sending its highly enriched plutonium to Russia to ground it up so it couldn't be used for nuclear weapons, and the USA was delivering low-enriched uranium they could use for their nuclear reactors instead.

The most obvious one is that state media refers to this invasion as a military operation, which it is. But it's also a war. 

Russian media works in half-truths, what they're saying isn't wrong, but it is for the most part misleading. It's pure propaganda.

Seems to me you're missing a trick here. 60B/yr isn't just for replacing hardware, it's paychecks for soldiers, rations, medical care, administration, and a zillion other things in addition to, you know, building more trucks and tanks and planes and helicopters and APCs etc to replace what's getting blown up in ten days of war in Ukraine. And then there's ammunition and everything else (including maintaining the nuclear arsenal, which is expensive). Putin's Russia is clearly behind on logistics.

But the rhetoric you use is just... silly. I hope you realize this. And I say that charitably.

Germany would always purchase russian gas and oil, simply because it's much cheaper. If Europe were to buy Saudi or Qatari resources - countries with their own criminal records, mind you - it would come at significant economic cost. Oil and gas are input resources into the economy, if their prices rise, everything rises. This would result in a real increase in poverty, and real suffering that comes with that.

At warp speed, he has overturned decades of post-Cold War German foreign policy, an approach so often predicated on caution and timidity towards the Russian leader. 

Berlin has sent anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine (ending the policy of not sending weapons to active war zones), halted the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, withdrawn its opposition to blocking Russia from the SWIFT international payments system, and even committed to spending 2% of its GDP on defence spending.

The biggest assault on a European state since World War Two has stiffened European resolve. But so, too, it seems has the relative weakness of America. Mindful of the botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan and possibility of a Trump 2.0 presidency, European leaders seem to have realised that they can no longer lean so heavily on Washington to defend democracy in this hour of maximum peril. Leadership of the free world has, in this crisis, become a common endeavour.

Even since the end of the Cold War, Washington has been calling upon European nations to do more to police its own neighbourhood, something they failed to do when the break-up of the former Yugoslavia sparked the Bosnian war. Historians may well conclude that it took a combination of Putin's aggressiveness, America's fragility, Ukraine's heroic resolve and the fear that Europe's post-war stability is truly on the line to finally make that happen.",False,1646566934.0,t3_t7qti1,t1_hzkeil5,,6,7,0,7,0,0,

I think Brexit was an absolutely catastrophic event, a massive geopolitical disaster for Europe and Britain, and a massive win for Putin and his insane Russian imperialist project, as well as autocratic bad actors everywhere.

And it was a massive blow to the surely needed European federal state that must emerge to secure our common interests such as energy, climate and defense policy, and the great project that is needed to bring back our common European industry from China.

One of my great hopes is that it can be reversed, maybe the fact that the Russian fascist state totally took it's mask off now can be the impetus for that.

I care about the survival of western enlightenment civilization.
