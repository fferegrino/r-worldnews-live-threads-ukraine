https://www.defense.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/3261666/pentagon-press-secretary-brigadier-general-pat-ryder-and-deputy-assistant-secre/

There is a lot of interesting stuff in this one, so I recommend reading it. 

About Abrams tanks:

>But we have to be cognizant of maintenance and sustainment considerations with tanks, and certainly we know that the Abrams tank in addition to being a gas guzzler is quite -- quite challenging to maintain.

From what she says, it appears that we are looking for better tank options from our partners around the world.

Also, for those who keep quibbling about this, she referred to the French vehicles as ""light tanks"", so there.

Another interesting thing is that, in order to help deal with the wide variety of equipment and systems, we've set up something called ""tele-maintenance"", where the Ukrainian mechanics, etc., can just call their counterparts and get live help while doing repairs.

Some of the Russian equipment in the war, like the BMP, are of similar age but are in poorer condition due to lack of maintenance.

Russia and the U.S. spent decades stockpiling supplies for a world war, and a good chunk of the stuff we've seen is from the 1960s - 1990s. It is crazy to see how much was in storage but even more to see the stark contrast of prioritizing ""boring"" routine maintenance. This is why procedures and checklists exist! You can trust that your equipment is functioning properly, even if the design is a few decades old.

NATO tanks have a lot of reverse gears and can move pretty quickly backwards. This is important because they can pop out, fire, and dip back into cover. With the newer models having shared networks, they can do this very effectively.

That, and they have working comms, which even the Germans had in WW2. The Russian's have (supposedly) had communication issues since the beginning, so I'd imagine that may hurt their tank use given their decision-makers-hide-in-the-rear doctrine.

The newer tanks have active protection for things like the missiles they'd see, and it works .. not like the Russian equivalent which just fires off and tries to scare the missile with an aura of Russian superiority.",1673146945.0,1673146646.0,t3_105f789,t1_j3eot3d,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

I say marginal because if western tanks were seeing the sort of anti-tank weapons and organized resistance that Russian tanks were seeing, there'd be no shortage of turrets popping off of Abrams and Leopards and so on.

That said, it's not the vehicles themselves that make the difference.  It's all the intelligence, logistics, doctrine, combined arms tactics that make the end result so asymmetrical in favor of the West.  It's why IFV's in Iraq were able to make mince meat of out of Soviet MBTs.

This however isnt likely the case. Russia may be mobilizing, but Ukraine mobilized first, had a free pick of how many they wanted to mobilize and has been accumulating reserves for a long time now. And these ones properly trained.

They have operational freedom to conduct an offensive now before deliveries should they choose so.

That said, a larger offensive later or even waiting to conduct their offensive would not lead to a Russian advantage, and the reason is that Ukraine both has and is now getting even more of a range advantage. They can soften Russian lines at range when ever they need to.

HIMARS and M270's outrange Russian artillery. 

Most of Ukraine's 155mm they got from western allies outrange most Russian counterparts and they just got a huge batch of rocket-asssisted shells for them to increase that range. They also have better precision and can silence the Russia artillery pieces capable of counterbattery more easily than their Russian adversaries can.

Ukrainians have plenty of ATGM's that allow engaging Russian IFV's and armor at range.

Bradleys when delivered outrange most of the Russian tanks with their TOW's, and their 25mm reaches out almost as far. 

The Ukrainians have more drones and better aerial recon

Ukraine has better access to theater intel overall.

All this points to a general advantage for Ukraine, and that advantage only inceases over time, as time means more and better weapon from western partners.

Russia on the other hand suffers from the same systemic weaknesses in army organisation as they have had all along, and due to sanctions can not replace armor or missile losses with anything on par or better.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,105f789,j3bbc4n,"In terms of ethnic breakaway states, there are 22 Republics out of Russia's federal regions, 13 of which have russian as a minority. This is most notable in the northern Caucasus Republics - Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia, North Ossetia, and Karachay-Cherkessia. Chechnya alone was troublesome enough for Russia to put down militarily. The problem is that these groups will not find it easy to work together either - different languages, sometimes different religions, etc. Kadyrov's regime in Chechnya would have to be overthrown, and it's not an easy location to provide physical support to - mountain ranges on one side, and Russia on the other. 

There's also a pocket around Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chuvashia, and Mari El where Russians are minorities, but again, location is a problem. These Republics are surrounded on all sides by Russian-majority oblasts, so providing support would be difficult. These regions generally seem fairly complacent in Russia too. 

Yakutia and Tuva are the only other ones with minorities of Russian populations, and Tuva is probably one of the poorest and least developed regions on the border with Mongolia. Yakutia is one of the largest areas though with huge natural resource deposits and a coast in the north sea. Very wild though and not easy to move around. There's only a single road that really connects the major cities. 

So those are basically your options for ethnic breakaway states, but right now there aren't really many good options. 

As for rising up against Putin, I guess you're asking about political factions. The are oligarchs, who have little to no political power, just money. The siloviki, who are members of police / security state like FSB, OMON, Rosgvardiya, etc. There are technocrats, who are generally politically neutral while being specialists who perform their functions skillfully (Nabiullina and Mishustin for example). There's also the military, and probably we should label a group called New Oligarchs (to separate guys like Prigozhin, who got their wealth and influence directly from Putin, and use their wealth and influence directly in support of Putin). The old oligarchs got their money before Putin (Abramovich for example). 

The old oligarchs have been broken and basically only exist so long as they don't get in Putin's way and pay their contributions to Putin's bank accounts. Any still in the country are certainly being watched 24/7 and window accidents can befall any who step out of line. 

The siloviki is Putin's club - he is the epitome of a silovik, and so far he commands very strong loyalty from the FSB (the biggest and strongest apparatus of the police state), but also the 400,000 members of Rosgvardia led by Zolotov (a close personal friend of Putin), but in general the police basically worship Putin and the whole thing looks very much like a cult. 

The technocrats have no power. 

People keep saying Prigozhin (from the New Oligarchs) is a threat to Putin, but I think the biggest evidence that this isn't really true is that Prigozhin is still alive. He is not siloviki, though he really tries to larp it with his PMC.  His Wagner force is not big enough to go up against Putin's police state - he would have to turn some elements of the police state against Putin. 

But here's the thing - if any of the police state is willing to turn against Putin, they won't support someone from outside their ranks like Prigozhin. It will be someone from within. Still, as long as Patrushev and Bortnikov (basically the daddies of the police state, if we consider Putin the grandaddy) remain solid to Putin, it's difficult for any rogue factions within the FSB or police state to rise up. 

The main problem here is really just communication and trust. You need allies and numbers to overthrow a government, and Putin has spent the last 20 years doing his best to make people trust no one, and monitor communications closely. No one even gets close to organizing anything against the government before they disappear. For that reason, I think Patrushev and Bortnikov are the only two mean who have any chance of ousting Putin, and unfortunately they are as bat-shit fascist crazy as Putin is.",False,1673081975.0,t3_105f789,t1_j3apdol,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

Its the ultimate grift. He pretends to care about his company enough so that TSLA remains at a price that he can sell at. He continuously sells TSLA, taking money from his fans, while paying Youtube grifters to say ""Buy the dip"" (taking money from the bagholders).

Craziest thing is that you can just go to EDGAR on the FCC site and see every single time Elon Musk has sold Tesla. You point this out, and the fanbois literally ignore you. Two years of constant selling of TSLA, and they still haven't noticed that its all just a scheme for Elon to extract money from the shareholders.

When you look at the demographic of males aged 18-50 the numbers change. It’s about 2:1 to Russia’s advantage.

Currently total casualties are probably about 4 Russians to every 1 Ukrainian (deaths are even more skewed, about 6 to 1).

If Russia totally loses its mind and commits 10 million troops, being 50% of its fighting age males (which is probably not even logistically possible), then on current ratios, we would expect it would take 2.5 million Ukrainian casualties to turn Russias 10 million into Causalities.

This does not take into account that Ukraines equipment situation is improving, while Russia’s equipment issues in this worst-case scenario would be…disastrous. So the numbers I am about to discuss really are a “best case scenario” for Russia if they commit 10 million men to invading g Ukraine.

At best, Russia will have 10 million casualties. With 3 million dead and 7 million crippled. Russia will be reduced to a country of 137 million people with 17 million men aged 18-50. Of which, 7 million (or about 40%) are crippled. The other 120 million will be under 18, female, or over 50 years old. That’s 1 able-bodied males in every 13 people. Aka disaster.

While Ukraine will have 2.5 million casualties. With 500k dead and 2 million crippled. Ukraine will be a nation of about 40 million people, with 9.5 million men aged 18-50. Of which 2 million will be crippled. That works out to 1 able bodied male in every 5 people. That’s hard, but it’s workable.

No. The point of Bradleys is that they do **ALL THE ABOVE**. They're not the best combat, they're not the best at carrying, they're not the best at armor (MRAPs are often better).

But Bradleys ""do it all"". Its the jack of all trades vehicle. And it turns out that having one vehicle that can kinda-sorta do all the roles on the battlefield is really useful. Even if it means its not the best at any particular role.

They'd probably feel just like you would if Russian cruise missiles were fired into your country deliberately. You wouldn't care that Russia didn't intend to attack targets in your country. You'd consider the blatant, intentional violation for offensive military operations as an act of war.

And that's assuming that Turkey knows that Russia doesn't mean to attack targets in Turkey. If Turkey is unaware and they start seeing dozens of cruise missiles flying towards their coastlines, what do *you* think their first thoughts will be?

That this is the start of WWIII. At that point Turkey starts fighting back, which includes invoking Article V.

>  And it changes nothing about what youre saying being flatout not true in any way. Read the charter, what youre saying isnt anywhere in there.

Have *you* read the charter? Because I don't think you have, or if you have, then you don't understand what it means.

It gives countries a lot of leeway in determining what constitutes an armed attack. If the United States can invoke Article V against non-state actors in order to invade another state, then firing missiles into a NATO country without that country's permission unambiguously constitutes an armed attack.

There's no lawyer who can rush to a friendly court to say ""Noooooo! Russia didn't mean to kill Turks! That doesn't counnnnnnnnnnnt!"" There's no one splitting hairs at NATO headquarters.

Have you heard of Hull Down position? [It looks like this](https://imgur.com/OwQXWKl), 3000+ meters (3-kilometers / 1.8 miles) away. 

Do you think you can see that? Because the M2 Bradley has thermal optic night-vision sensors, so it can see you, and its TOW missile can fire well in excess of 3000+ meters.

If you can see the enemy in combat, that's cause _THEY_ made a mistake. All troops (even vehicles, like Tanks or M2 Bradleys), train to drive in a way that they're hidden from view. A good driver can identify hiding positions while driving, and position themselves behind hills and be effectively invisible to enemies.

> Yes, that is what I'm saying. They literally have been doing this and have been very successful.

They'll be more successful with an M2 Bradley in any kind of Ambush situation.

There's a reason why US vehicles have turrets on the tippy-top of their vehicle. So that they can shoot you in Hull Down position (aka: when most of the vehicle is hiding behind a hill or tree), so enemy thermal sensors can't see the vehicle... and careful camouflage can make it very difficult to spot.

If Hull down position isn't sufficient for an ambush, you can even go into Turret-down position and even hide the top-of-the-vehicle from the enemy.",1673080231.0,1673079928.0,t3_105f789,t1_j3b86lk,,9,8,0,8,0,0,
