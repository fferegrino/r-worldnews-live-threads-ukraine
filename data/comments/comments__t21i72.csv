Russia has one 5th generation Fighter Jet, the SU-57. They have 5 combat ready SU-57's. The rest of the Russian Air Force has a mix of 4th to 4.5th generation planes. These range from SU-27's to Mig-35's. Don't be fooled by designation of the Mig or SU 35's. They are essentially upgraded versions of the SU-27 and Mig-29.

Their airforce consists of about 600-800 of these fighter jets and multirole jets.

The Ukranian airforce consists of SU-27's and Mig-29's. These have been upgraded as well just not to the extent of the SU-35 and Mig-35. Ukraine has about 100 of these fighter jets and multirole jets.

The fighting ground for these air forces are about even in terms of capability which makes the fighting come down to numbers and pilot talent.

As for ground forces. Russia's mechanized units consist of tanks ranging from the T-72 (upgraded) to the T-90. There are no operational T-14's (a next generation tank).

Russia has about 2800 operational MBT's (main battle tanks) with 16,000 older tanks in reserve.

Ukraine has tanks ranging from the T-64 (upgraded) to the T-84. Of these MBT's Ukraine has roughly 2000.

This is a bit of a rambling stream of thought so bear with me please:

As far as I can tell, everyone in any position of power in the Ukrainian government has been on the job for like 3 years tops: Zelensky and his cabinet, Rada members like Halyna Yanchenko and Kira Rudyk (they have been very prominent on EU news channels). And, after just clicking through the Wikipedia page list, they are ALL young 30s-40s. The Servant of the People party also seems to be wildly diverse in terms of the backgrounds of its politicians.

One thing that really, really stood out to me was that on the 23rd Zelensky released a statement while wearing a suit like any other President, but on the 24th after the invasion he, and his cabinet, had switched to what is clearly part of the Ukrainian combat uniform.... without insignia of any kind. I interpret that as Ukraine's democratic institutions understanding that this was an emergency and the president needs to be dressed for it, like he is putting on a windbreaker for a bad storm.

What he isn't doing is covering himself in ribbons, medals, or any kind of authoritarian bullshit.

Ukraine has an incredibly young, consistent democracy (Shout out to Poroshenko who also seems to love democracy) that has pretty much only existed since 2015, but holy shit are they setting the fucking bar right now.

*From CNN's Sharon Braithwaite in London*

The speed of the Russian advance on Ukraine has temporarily slowed ""likely due to acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance,‚Äù according to the British Ministry of Defence.¬†

In its latest intelligence update on Ukraine, the ministry says the capture of Ukraine's capital of Kyiv ""remains Russia's primary military objective.""

""Russian forces are bypassing major Ukranian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them,"" the update added.

""Overnight clashes in Kyiv are likely to have involved limited numbers of pre-positioned Russian sabotage groups,"" the ministry said.

**US security assistance to Ukraine has arrived within ""last couple of days,"" senior defense official says**

*From CNN's Oren Liebermann*

US security assistance to Ukraine has arrived ‚Äúwithin the last couple of days,‚Äù a senior defense official said Saturday, indicating that US President Joe Biden's administration has continued to send in aid even after Russia launched its invasion.

‚ÄúWe have continued to flow assistance to the Ukrainians, even since the airspace has become disputed and contested, and we‚Äôre going to continue to look for additional venues to do that,‚Äù the official said on a call with reporters.

Late Friday night, the US approved¬†another $350 million¬†in security assistance to Ukraine. In a statement Saturday morning, the State Department announced that it would include ‚Äúlethal defensive assistance‚Äù that would help Ukraine deal with armored, airborne and other threats.¬†

Though the senior defense official would not detail the exact types of equipment beyond Javelin anti-armor missiles, the US has provided Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine in the last few weeks.¬†¬†

The official would not say how the assistance would arrive in Ukraine.¬†

Since Ukraine‚Äôs airspace is contested, the US has not flown any aircraft into or over Ukraine. But countries like Poland have openly stated that they have sent ammunition into Ukraine with ground convoys, one of the only viable options given the current situation.

‚ÄúI think you'd have to assume that ground routes would certainly be on the list of options that we would consider,‚Äù the defense official said without providing further details.

**Heaviest fighting in Ukraine is ""in and around Kharkiv,"" senior US defense official says**

*From CNN's Ellie Kaufman and Oren Liebermann*

The heaviest fighting in Ukraine is ‚Äúin and around Kharkiv,‚Äù a senior US defense official said Saturday.

The official said the US saw ‚Äústiff resistance on the northern advance towards Kyiv,‚Äù as well. ‚ÄúBut the heaviest fighting we still assess is in and around Kharkiv,‚Äù the official added.

Russian forces are facing the resistance to their invasion in the northern part of Ukraine along two axes, the official said: ‚Äúdown towards Kyiv and generally from Belgorod towards Khakriv.‚Äù

Now we've got Ukraine being talked about joining the EU, NATO, and other organizations, and getting a ton of aid and global attention that will benefit them for years to come, when just yesterday nobody wanted to get involved.

Fighting continued across Ukraine but the capital, Kyiv, remained in Ukrainian hands when night fell.
More EU countries ‚Äì including France, Italy and Greece ‚Äì have said they would back a ban on Russia using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian warships, which would block some ships advancing towards Ukraine. Turkey has yet to decide.
Germany approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to Ukraine by the Netherlands, marking a shift in policy from its previous position of not shipping weapons.

Ukraine‚Äôs capital Kyiv is under curfew until Monday. The mayor said: ‚ÄúAll civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy‚Äôs sabotage and reconnaissance groups.‚Äù
Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has said it will support all EU sanctions against Russia and will not block any.

Twitter said it was aware users in Russia were experiencing restricted access, following Facebook‚Äôs similar announcement on Friday.

Countries including Lithuania, Estonia and Romania blocked airspace for Russian aircraft, with Russia responding by banning Romanian airliners from Russian airspace.

Full consensus for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT has been achieved, the process has begun",1645898892.0,1645898139.0,t3_t21i72,t3_t21i72,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

German government wants to impose ""targeted"" restrictions on Swift Germany has been one of the last countries to block Russia's exclusion from the Swift international payment system. Now the German government announced a ""targeted and functional"" decoupling of the country.  
  
The German government has called for a ""targeted and functional"" restriction of the Swift international payment system because of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Work is being done ""at full speed"" on how to limit Russia's disconnection from Swift ""in such a way that it hits the right people,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and German Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Greens). More on the topic  
  
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj had appealed to the EU to exclude Russia from the Swift system in addition to the sanctions already adopted. ""There is already almost full support from EU countries to disconnect Russia from Swift,"" Selenskyj said in a video message. ""I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision."" Germany blocked sharp sanction  
  
Baerbock had initially also justified Berlin's rejection by saying that excluding Russia would have a ""broad impact"" and would also affect the population. The goal, however, was to sanction those responsible for the bloodshed in Ukraine. Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn warned of the danger of a ""world trade crisis."" In response, Polish head of government Mateusz Morawieck accused Germany of ""stony egoism"" for not being able to decide on ""truly crushing"" sanctions against Russia.  
  
France, on the other hand, expressed confidence on Saturday that there would soon be an agreement in the EU on Russia's Swift exclusion. ""There is no deadlock, only a useful debate,"" the government said. The EU Commission has made contacts with other countries that can supply gas, such as Qatar, the Usa, Nigeria and Algeria, it said. Italy, Cyprus and Hungary also signaled they would support a Swift exclusion of Russia.

The invasion is going much harder than Putin expected. I can't imagine the Russian military highest ranking officers staying in their place after this failure in Ukraine, according to the rumors they are losing much more lifes and equipment than they initially expected.

As they lose momentum, Ukrainian morale will grow, so will their preparation for counter attacks and possibly if they get more ammo and equipment they could even turn it around and push Russians back to their pre-invasion borders in Crimea and Donbas.

But Putin has invested way too much into this attack, and is losing hard, which makes me think he'll have to end up massing more forces.

What strikes me most from a military point of view is how little Russians understand the importance of drones in modern wars. They seem unable to surgically bomb Ukrainian positions and attain air superiority.

But in the end, Putin just cannot allow himself to lose this war and obtain his goals. Russia has already lost way too much due to this invasion to go home empty.

I see a lot of people praising social media as our new way to get up-to-the-minute updates, but that system comes with its own inherit downsides.

1. Playing the bomb the city card. This could be effective if Russia have more control over the air space, which apparently they don't quite have. 

2. Keep the pressure up like these past few days, with more troops surrounding all cities and periodic missile launches. This doesn't prove as effective yet, but question is how long Ukraine can keep this up.

3. Regroup and refocus on either eastern Ukraine or Kyiv. They have problems with supplies and can't keep this up indefinitely. However this is not very likely with Putin in power.

I also wonder if this is why so much of the force has stayed behind. They probably expected logistical issues keeping even a small force fed and fueled. If they tossed 200k in there at once they would be fighting over food by now. 

Pretty wild to see Russia have this much trouble with supply lines so close to home.

Even semi-modern tanks (tracked vehicles) and apcs (generally wheeled) are designed in a way that they can very much handle mud and rough terrain.

&#x200B;

That said, vehicles break down and need to get repaired and it is definitely a lot easier (and a lot less hellish) to do repairs on dry ground.

But also? Even if the countryside is completely muddy and shit... there isn't a lot of reason to spend significant amounts of time in it. Basically any halfway modern nation is mostly paved roads and highways. You might want to offroad for the final few miles (assuming it even makes sense since there are a lot of small suburbs and outskirts for cities) but mostly you are better off just flooring it on the paved roads instead. Road networks are explicitly designed (organically or intentionally) to allow for fast travel from point A to B.

... Which also makes it a hell of a lot easier to lay ambushes and fire javelins and NLAWs up the ass of any russian dumb enough to use a tank in 2022.

Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin‚Äôs lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.

Russians didn‚Äôt have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can‚Äôt physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months ‚Äì if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians ‚Äì women and children ‚Äì to sow panic. This is their trump card.

Russia‚Äôs whole plan relies on panic ‚Äì that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.

The Ukrainians must avoid panic!

The same goes for NATO: even if e.g. Trump was still in power and would order a nuclear strike against Russia, I suspect US generals would refuse due to the potential for a nuclear cascade.

And this is also why NATO isn't getting involved in Ukraine directly: the risk for a runaway effect of missiles flying both sides is very real. Even with missile defense systems in place, the damage this can cause is just too great.

.If russian forces take kiev, then the remaining civilian populations arent going to just roll over, itll only sow a generation of vehement hatred for the russian federation, putin has already blown through a lot of resources and goodwill with the public (what little there still was) to just get this far, theyll be some territory up, but likely be at an overall loss, especially factoring in the damage this does to their international relations.

.If russian forces are repelled and a ceasefire is reached...well for Russia its the same as the above except they dont even have territory to show for it. Meanwhile Ukraine gets back its autonomy, maybe asseses the regions of crimea, luhansk etc. Maybe they cede them as part of a peace treaty, maybe they call the separatist groups out as russian plants and send them across the border, both of these options are really bad for optics, maybe a third option can be achieved but itll be tricky. Either way, the casualties on the Ukrainian side will probably be in the thousands, and the damage to buildings and infrastructure will likely be in the billions.

But to actually address your question:

With the disparity in military force, troop morale, and Kiev's ""home advantage"" I'd say they have a 50/50 shot at pulling through in the short term.

Long term, Ukraine wins. Ireland was conquered by the Cromwell in 1653. We were occupied for just shy of 300 years, facing famine, discrimination and erasure of our culture, but here we are, a nation.

This may take a while.  Then they probably need to spend small amounts of time together. Internet might have more suggestions.

,t21i72,hyjh0xu,"Do you really believe that the world has the power to destroy Russia's nuclear weapons before they are launched? Even Sub based ones? Putin makes those threats because he knows that he can't be stopped before doing massive damage to the world. It's naive to think that the world could just unite against Russia and completely stop everything going on without anyone getting hurt. What we need is sanctions, cutoffs, war crime trials, peacekeepers entering to protect citizens that choose to flee. We can't just issue an ultimatum, because we can't follow through with that, and Putin knows. 

We do need more action, and IMO it is going too slow, but something as brash and destructive as what you suggest is not the answer. It should never be the answer, in this case toppling Russian power might be a 'legitimate' option but that sets the precedent that any country can intervene with any injustice, and who is the arbiter of how bad that injustice is? Does the India have the right to invade China because of China's multiple ongoing genocides? Does Mexico have the right to invade the USA for it horrible treatment of migrants? Does Germany have the right to invade England because of the way Ireland is treated? Does the Pakistan have the right to invade France becuase of their suppression of religion? Does any country have the right to invade another country where gay sex is punishable by death? 

You see, I gave a lot of examples, and you probably draw the line at this current event, or China's genocides, but you aren't the one who draws the lines. Ultimately, people will cross what you believe to be the acceptable standard, which is exactly what Putin did. If you choose to cross that line, the world becomes a more dangerous place where wars are fought for righteousness. The world used to be that way, and many people died for someone else's version of right and wrong. I feel pain for Ukraine, and hope that the world comes to their aid in more swift actions, maybe even boots on the ground in Ukraine (Not Russia though), but you risk trivializing warfare as a means to correct the wrongs in the world.

Sure, Biden was probably just listening to the best intelligence and psychological strategies at his disposal, but the bar is low for our leaders and he followed through with the science of how to respond to this situation and did a GREAT job. It actually makes me incredibly, incredibly disheartened that so much of the US doesn't see how well he executed on these plans *and* rallied a collective US/European response to the situation (remember that pretty much all of the EU thought Putin was bluffing until pretty much relentless seriousness from the White House).

This is what is being discussed atm.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOS-1

The Russians are moving those in. That's the TOS-1 Heavy Flamethrower System, multiple rocket launcher and thermobaric weapon.

Here are some in use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGYLgQk5xDo

http://www.military-today.com/artillery/tos1.htm

> _The TOS-1 fires 220 mm rockets. There are two types of warheads - incendiary and fuel-air explosive. The fuel-air explosive weapons are also called as vacuum or thermobaric. This type of munitions releases a large cloud of flammable gas and causes massive explosions. It is used to clear out bunkers and other fortifications. The TOS-1 heavy flamethrower system has a relatively short maximum firing range of only 3.5 km. Minimum range is 400 meters. This heavy flamethrower system launches a single rocket or a pair of two rockets within 0.5 s. Full salvo duration is 7.5 or 15 seconds. A full salvo of this flamethrower system covers area of 200 by 400 meters._
