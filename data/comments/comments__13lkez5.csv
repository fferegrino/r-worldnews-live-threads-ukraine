I first discovered them years ago through [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxg1dL_x0gw&t=1706s) but naturally their performance has taken on a different quality since the full-scale invasion. The 'centrepiece' of the show was a somber song dedicated to all those who have died under Russian aggression, set to close-up drone footage of destroyed cities. This went straight into a more triumphant song showing videos taken by soldiers celebrating as they flew the Ukrainian flag on captured Z tanks, eating together, sending messages to family and so on. I'm not very good at putting these things into words but it was an incredible evocation of both the horrors of the invasion and the amazing resistance to it. At another point, they sung in the Crimean Tartar language and set it to photos of everyday people shortly before the deportation of the Tartars 85 years ago by the USSR, creating a thread between the past and present. 

Anyway, I wrote all this because I think that anybody who reads these daily threads would get a lot out of their performance, so I'd very highly recommend it if you get the chance to see them. And some of you probably know people who are indifferent to the war or who are even skeptical about supporting Ukraine...well, it might be a bit difficult to get such people to the show, but if they did go I think it could change a few minds.",False,1684483369.0,t3_13lkez5,t3_13lkez5,,0,79,0,79,0,0,

>Putin has in recent years played up grievances against NATO enlargement in ways that he did not when NATO was enlarging in Russia’s neighborhood. The four countries that joined the Alliance after 2004 are all in the Balkans, quite distant from Russia’s borders. The Russian president reacted calmly to this year’s Finnish and Swedish decisions to apply to join — even though Finland’s addition will more than double the length of Russia’s borders with NATO.  
>  
>Putin’s decision to launch a new attack on Ukraine appears to have several motivations. One is geopolitical, the Kremlin’s desire to have a Russian sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space and its fear that Ukraine was invariably moving away from Moscow. This is a broader question than Ukraine’s relationship with NATO. But nothing has done more than Russian policy and actions since 2014 to push Ukraine away from Russia and toward the West.  
>  
>Russian domestic politics looks like a second key factor. For the Kremlin, a democratic, Western-oriented, economically successful Ukraine poses a nightmare, because that Ukraine would cause Russians to question why they cannot have the same political voice and democratic rights that Ukrainians do. For the Kremlin, regime preservation is job number one.  
>  
>The third factor is Putin himself. Reading his July 2021 essay on Ukraine or his February 24 speech on Russia’s recognition of the so-called “people’s republics” in Donbas makes clear that Putin does not accept the legitimacy of a sovereign and independent Ukrainian state. He regards most of Ukraine as part of historical Russia.  
>  
>On June 9, the Russian president voiced the quiet part aloud, implicitly comparing himself to Peter the Great on “returning” historic Russian lands to Moscow’s control. Putin said, “Apparently, it is also our lot to return \[what is Russia’s\] and reinforce \[the country\].” He said not one word about NATO or NATO enlargement.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-19-23/index.html

""President Joe Biden reversed his previous objections to providing Ukraine with F16 fighter jets because he believes in equipping the country for a long-term fight against Russia, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Saturday in Japan.

Sullivan confirmed Biden told his Group of Seven counterparts that the US would support a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots on the fighter jets, suggesting the decision came at a turning point in the conflict and was meant as a “long term commitment to Ukrainian self defense.”

“Now that we have delivered everything we said we were going to deliver so we can put the Ukrainians in a position to make progress on the battlefield, we’ve reached a moment where it's time to look down the road and to say what is Ukraine going to need as part of a future force to be able to deter and defend against Russian aggression. F16 fourth generation fighter aircraft are part of that,” Sullivan said.

He said the aircraft weren’t currently what Ukraine needs in its battle against Russia, but that they would play a role later.

""Our view is that where the F16 fits into the fight is not right now,” he said.

He affirmed the longstanding US position that military equipment provided to Ukraine isn’t meant to launch attacks in Russian territory.

“All of the capabilities that the United States has provided to Ukraine come with the basic proposition that the United States is not enabling or supporting attacks on Russian territory,” he said.

Sullivan declined to provide a timetable for how long the training would take place.""",False,1684548152.0,t3_13lkez5,t3_13lkez5,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-19-23/index.html

""National security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed the in-person attendance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the G7 Summit in Hiroshima, Japan, and indicated that President Joe Biden will meet with him.

“I think it’s a safe bet that President Biden will meet with him,” Sullivan told reporters in Hiroshima Saturday morning local time.

He added that he did not have a formal announcement on a meeting to share at this time, but that Biden “looks forward to the opportunity to be able to sit down face-to-face” with Zelensky.

Sullivan did not provide details on Zelensky’s travel to Japan, but said the US was “not the party – the country – that flew him here.”

Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also confirmed Zelensky's attendance.

Kishida said in a Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement that Japan's government has decided to hold a session on Ukraine with G7 leaders on Sunday, which is the last day of the summit.

""The decision was made to hold a session on Ukraine with the G7 leaders, with face-to-face participation by President Zelensky,"" the statement read. ""President Zelensky will also participate as a guest in the session on peace and stability with the G7 Heads of State and Government and the leaders of the invited countries.""

The statement confirmed that Kishida and Zelensky also plan to hold a bilateral meeting on Sunday. 

Kishida reiterated that ""the situation in Ukraine"" is one of the main agenda items of the G7 Hiroshima Summit and that it ""is important to reflect the voice of Ukraine.""

Some context: Zelensky’s in-person participation seemed more in flux Saturday morning in Japan, leaving open the possibility he could ultimately join only virtually. The sensitive nature of his security arrangements meant officials were wary of saying exactly how he would participate in the meeting.""",False,1684548374.0,t3_13lkez5,t3_13lkez5,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

Rather than incompetence and “dithering”, it seems much more likely to me that the west has purposefully sent the weapons in stages to make Russia less likely to go nuclear, or for it to escalate into a larger conflict. 

There’s a rather surprising predictability with which weapons get sent and when. one weapons system at a time, get the smaller nations to send a small amount of it first to establish the idea of them being there without being seen as a massive escalation, then get the bigger nations to follow afterwards with much more of it, wait a while until things have settled down a bit and then do the same with the next weapons system. Rinse and repeat until you’re sending Ukraine jets and long range missiles and the Russians barely care anymore.

To be fair, remembering back to the mood during the opening months of the war, it really did feel like sending a massive shipment of heavy weapons would lead to a WW3 type scenario, but by drip feeding new weapons it’s seemed to have calmed things down a lot and made that incredibly unlikely as Russia won’t do anything completely insane over another minor infraction in a long list of them.",False,1684536915.0,t3_13lkez5,t3_13lkez5,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

043c155ba5cc328b5b19963ca0ed0254,13lkez5,jkvjyb3,"I think that is a bit deceptive, most times F16s have faced off against soviet jets in the past 30-40 years it has usually been in the context of NATO or the US having overwhelming superiority in terms of numbers of planes in the air, suppression of air defences, radar jamming and excellent AWACS themselves, as well as the most advanced missiles and countermeasures available. The fact that F16s dominated the Yugoslavian or Iraqi airforce in old poorly maintained MiGs doesn't really prove a lot.

In a more evenly matched combat environment, i think a lot depends on what kind of avionics package and the missile technology they have- which means talking about an 'F16' versus say a MiG29 is a bit meaningless. Things like the range, top speed, ceiling and agility capabilities of those two airframes matter far less than who has the more advanced sensors and more advanced missiles- because if you see them first and shoot a missile at them first, none of those other attributes really matter, and the difference in performance in those key categories of avionics and missile tech between an un-upgraded F16A from the 80s and a F16C Block 50 or modernised F16E is enormous.

Just looking at what is in service around Europe, the dutch, danish and belgian planes were F16A/Bs (early 80s era airframes) but they received major avionics and weaponry upgrades in the 2000s to bring them up to modern NATO standards. They aren't the best variants of the F16 in existence but they are  certainly light years ahead of what Ukraine currently has.

Poland and Greece both have F16C Block 50s which are a substantial step up on that, many of them were only built and delivered in the last decade, they are entirely modern highly advanced fighters which would be a nightmare for russia.

Unless the next hill the appeasement faction in Washington wants to die on is imagining russia will be fine with upgraded F16As but irrationally angered by F16Cs, the US could very easily match any European commitment with the entirely modern, 4.5 generation equivalent F-16C Block 52s they currently have in air national guard squadrons.",False,1684565876.0,t3_13lkez5,t1_jkupy8i,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Edit: I thought of something last night, and of the replies in that thread is the first time I've seen anyone bring it up: air defense for airfields. My understanding is that Ukraine has a limited number airfields suitable for F-16 use, and they aren't as capable of using highways as the MiGs. 

Russia is certainly going to know, or discover, those locations, and they'll become a target for missile strikes. Wouldn't it be necessary to establish air defense capable of defending against missile strikes at every one of those locations? Otherwise, they'll lose both some of the aircraft, but also any place to operate and maintain them from.

I don't think what they're outlining is going to be much of an issue. Whatever jets Ukraine gets are not net new in the F16 pool. If they're getting even 50 of the thousands of F16 flying, the countries flying these aircraft already have spare parts for these specific jets because they've already been flying and maintaining them. There's already a pipeline in place to support them. The failure rate of each component is extremely well studied and parts are produced accordingly. 

I will tell you one thing, in aviation, every hour an aircraft cannot fly costs the operator tens of thousands of dollars if not more. Aircraft and engine companies have understood that. When a part was not available, they'd make it and ship it right away. Often times, they'd even ship the broken part back to the factory, repair it and send it back all within the same day..

I can guarantee you that within 48 hours, any supplier can produce any part needed and ship it to Ukraine. Because the coalition will pay the supplier more and the supplier will say yes. Suppliers don't care to delay their normal production by a few hours because they'll just charge accordingly. Jet deliveries are measured in years, not hours. There is no one that can come slap their wrists if they're one day late on an aircraft delivery.

While it's true that surrounding Bakhmut sounds like a huge thing, you need to think about how the Ukrainian troops are supposed to fight in that situation. On one side they'd have a city with a lot of good hiding places, while on the other side they'd face Russian reinforcements and artillery. At the same time their supply lines would have to go through many kilometers of contested territory, where it faces Russian attacks from both the left and right. So overall it may put Russian troops in Bakhmut in a dangerous position, it'd also do the same for Ukrainian troops who're doing the surrounding. Not to mention the issue of air defenses. (Reminds me of Caesar? who surrounded a Germanic? village with a wall during a siege and then built a 2nd wall towards his back also around the whole village for Germanic? reinforcements)

Soledar on the other hand appears to me much safer. Once Soledar is captured then the whole Russian front north of Bakhmut would be at the risk of being surrounded. At the same time the Russian artillery north east of Bakhmut would be forced to relocate as otherwise they'd be under threat of Ukrainian troops. Russian air defenses north of Bakhmut would also be greatly weakened due to Ukrainian troops being capable of taking them out if they're too close.

So overall Soledar appears to me as a much easier to achieve goal that puts a lot of pressure on the Russian front line in that whole area. Though, as mentioned before, I'm not an expert. Things like geography can have a huge impact. i.e. if there is no good way for Ukraine to push Soledar due to the whole area being open ground, or if the supply lines south of Bakhmut can be easily secured due to terrain it'd obviously greatly reduce the threat I mentioned before. Not to mention the whole issue of where Russian troops are actually deployed and what kind of defenses they've installed.

And there is also the moral issue. I mean even if Ukraine can't surround Bakhmut, the attempt itself may cause Russian troops to escape Bakhmut in fear of it happening.",False,1684531698.0,t3_13lkez5,t1_jktmpax,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

Remember that Russia's strategy is braindead, because it must be braindead. Russia does **NOT** have a group of NCOs like USA/NATO does. Their decision-making and strategy is based on what can be accomplished with top-down commands from far away.

This is by design. NCOs and officers who gain the respect of their peers turn into well-respected war heroes... and war heroes are some of the most dangerous opponents to authoritarians.

As such, the mid-tier leaders (NCOs like Sergeants or lower-level officers like Captains in USA/NATO armies) are braindead, because they have to be for Putin's survival. They aren't given as much room to be creative, heroic, or intelligent.

But due to this command structure: it means that Russia can effectively force untrusted prison conscripts to do their job (march forward and dig a trench before the Ukrainians blow you up). What would almost certainly result in a [Fragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragging) in the USA can be forced upon the prison conscripts, because those prison conscripts don't have effective weaponry to begin with.

I highly recommend a Frontline series called ""The Putin Files"" that's available on YouTube. It's from 2017/2018, and was done primarily in response to Russian meddling in the US elections.

They interviewed a bunch of journalists, political scientists, and political figures both *both* sides of things, and there is a lot of discussion about Russia and Ukraine all of the way back to the BushII administration.

You might be surprised at how much disagreement there was over how to handle the situation in Ukraine. It's a terrific way to gain some insight into the history and nuances of the entire situation, including learning a lot about Putin and his road to power.

You'll recognize most of the names: Julia Ioffe, Antony Blinken, Michael McFaul, Victoria Nuland, Vladimir Kara-Murza, Strobe Talbot, etc.

While you start anywhere, I was first referred to Masha Gessen, wherein I learned a lot about Putin's background.

Ukraine has no meaningful navy to speak of.  Lacking the ability to make an amphibious landing, they'd have invade via the Isthmus of Perekop, a strip of land all of 5 km wide at some points.  Perekop has been swallowing armies for the past 500 years, armies trying to do exactly that.

Now think about how much artillery Russia has emplaced in Crimea.  How easy it would be to pretty much continuously shell that approach, how well-practiced and pre-sighted to the approach they are.  How dug in the troops are there, how fresh they are, having not been engaged during this entire conflict.

Half the reason why Russia's invading Ukraine is the preserve Crimea, to be sure, but their retreat in the fall is also illustrative: They shortened their lines, but they retreated to positions preserving the land bridge they'd created in the process, hoping to negotiate a cease-fire that allows them to keep the land bridge and keep Crimea supplied with food and water that it's not able to produce on it's own, far better than the Kerch Strait bridge was capable of.

An amphibious landing is not realistic.  An bombing campaign lacking any real air force right now is not realistic.  The only realistic way to retake Crimea is an extended siege, running those troops out of ammunition, equipment, food, and water.  (Water in particular's a problem for Crimea.)

I saw some analysis online. The TL;DR is that Russia's spies were telling Putin that everything was set for Ukraine to basically submit to Russia.

1. Because that was the spy's job. They were supposed to have been (since 2014) been setting things up for a large chunk of Ukrainian Leadership to just switch-over to the Russian side.

2. But because this is Russia, those spies were just collecting their paychecks and then lying to their bosses. (Some spies were correct and we saw some degree of internal-Ukrainian sabotage early in the war, but no where needed to the degree needed for Russia to win).

---------

Note that this **literally** happened in August 2021 in Afghanistan. Taliban basically had agreements with various Afghani leaders to switch everything over to Taliban control. That's why they were able to take over Afghanistan so fast and why the USA was caught with our pants down.

I imagine that when Putin saw the July/August 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, Putin assumed his own spies were making similar progress and wanted to finally send the order.

It's a nice way of saying that even with this green light for F16s they won't serve a role in the counteroffensive because the Ukrainians won't be flying them for months.  It's also a continuation of US talking points up until now which was that the F-16 would take Ukraine quite a bit of time to integrate into their military  due to its complexity. 

But it's also a nod to the fact that Ukraine's military has begun an inevitable transition away from having a typical ex-Sov army with T72s and MIGs and Mi-24s and old tech to one furnished with Western military hardware. Furnishing the weapons themselves is only a small part of it, you're basically rebuilding entire domestic industries and lines around new supply chains and rebuilding entire military doctrines around your new capabilities and rebuilding your training and maintenance and establishing long term relationships with suppliers and standing up the military liaisons -- this is a process that normally takes decades and enormous commitments.   


 In the case of the F-16, like the Abrams tank, you have a weapons platform that requires a sizable support infrastructure. The Ukrainians will be able to make short term use of both weapon systems but will not be able to get the most out of them for quite some time because they'll have to master all this new stuff and figure out ways to integrate these advanced capabilities into their existing command and control infrastructure, even as they're trying to figure out how to integrate the weapons themselves into their existing supply chains and maintenance and new unit training.    


Now, which Western arms manufacturers are going to end up getting the most orders from Ukraine as it rebuilds and eastern NATO states as they bolster themselves against a similar Russian invasion?

Kaiser Wilhelm was dead set on challenging Britain's naval supremacy and kept building more battleships. In the years before WW1, the Imperial Germany navy commissioned 3-5 battleships per year. 

This is often quoted as one of the reasons Britain joined WW1. They were scared of a Germany with a strong navy.

What stopped the race was first WW1, when both Britain and Germany got stuck in a landwar with their navies in a deadlock where neither dared attack (exception: Battle of Jutland 1916 which was a tactical win for Germany but a strategic win for Britain). 

After WW1 the race resumed, but between the Britain, the US, Japan and to a degree France and Italy, until they in 1922 (The Washington Naval Treaty) agreed on a cap of navies to not go bankrupt building metal monstrositious instead of investing in their societies.

The only issue is thay there aren't enough of those for Sweden to give many away. So the F-16 is the best realistic option. Meaning Ukraine has to be able to defend conventional air fields, suppress/destroy enough GBAD systems to fly at altitude, and contest air space. If Ukraine suddenly had trained air and ground crews, and three squadrons worth of air frames, their ability to use them would still be limited.

The concept of tank destroyers was created back when tanks did **not** work everywhere.  Up to and including WWII, tanks were considered an infantry support vehicle.  They were supposed to be used as mobile machine gun/heavy gun platforms that could advance with infantry and break through an entrenched position.  They were designed to fight infantry, not other tanks.  Tank *destroyers* , on the other hand, were meant to counter tanks specifically.  They had large guns capable of knocking out a tank at long range, but not the armor or firepower for an anti-infantry role.  

As a result of WWII, though, tank doctrine changed dramatically for a number of reasons.  First, anti-tank weapons even in the hands of infantry, became so strong that traditional steel armor was becoming obsolete.  The amount of armor required to protect a tank from an anti-tank gun was making tanks too heavy to be useful.  ATGMs made the problem even worse, such that by the 1950s and 1960s, tanks carried far less armor than in WWII (see the T-62 and Leopard I).  Second, the likelihood that a tank had to fight another tank was much higher.  So the idea of the Main Battle Tank (MBT) came about with collapsed light, medium, heavy tanks and tank destroyers into one vehicle.  

I wouldn't even call the Centauro a 'Tank Destroyer' in its own right.  It's a gun platform, like the Stryker or the LAV.  It's designed to fit a number of support roles by allowing multiple turrets on a single platform.  It *can* be a tank destroyer, when mounted with an anti-tank gun.  But it can also be an IFV, mobile artillery, etc. depending on the configuration.  For example, the Stryker tank-destroyer variant uses ATGMs instead of an anti-tank gun.  The variant of the Styker with an anti-tank gun was already retired.",False,1684516491.0,t3_13lkez5,t1_jkslk96,,3,10,0,10,0,0,

China gets the majority of its imported oil from the Persian Gulf. Keeping Iran and SA from shooting at each others' boats keeps the oil flowing to China.

SA is trying to find a new security guarantor since the US is no longer leaving carrier groups in the Persian Gulf year round and Iran is in a relatively weak position due to domestic protests.

From 2009 up until 2019 when Russian made upgrades to the Iranian air defenses, 10 of the Block 10 RQ-4A Global Hawks successfully leverage their stealth modes, at the time cutting edge anti-IR/electronic spoofing ""self-protection"" countermeasures, almost completely composite frames with radar absorbing coating along with the other base RQ-4 RCS reduction features like the angled stabilators, dorsal engine intake placement provided enough diminished RCS to keep it out of almost current Russian or lesser air defense for almost a decade after the Block 10 RQ-4A came out. The downside is these upgrades cost twice the price of the earlier RQ-4 blocks. Here is a RAND whitepaper on the upgraded RQ-4A Global Hawk RCS changes  vs U-2 SIGINT collection that allowed it to avoid Russian made systems for as long as it did before its first downing from SAMs. Originally the U-2 was not impervious to Soviet era SAMs, but were retrofitted in the 2000s to be the U-2S with stealth coating and research learned in the 12-22 years since the start of development of the F-117 and early B-2,  so it now could  fly over Iran, Iraq and other Russian SAM systems for signals recovery with no losses. Rumsfield ordered the U-2 decommissioning as the later block ""stealth"" RQ-4A proved to be even more stealthy and better value, though the U-2S is still flying like the Chinese balloon incident because there aren't enough late block RQ-4As to fully replace it yet.

In that way, it can achieve at least most of what it wants.

I think that's cool.  I have no problems with that goal.  The thing is though, is that France wants to ensure that neither the U.S., China, or Russia get so far ahead in global dominance that the EU can't catch up, so they constantly play this balance of power game.  Sometimes they cooperate with one of the other 3 great powers, sometimes they antagonize, but they're constantly trying to play those three powers off of each other, making sure that no side gains a huge advantage in any major area, so that hopefully, in a few decades, those powers can be supplanted by a French dominated EU.

Charles De Gaulle once famously said, ""France has no friends, only interests.""  I think that was about as true a statement as has ever been made about the history of French foreign policy.

Think this one through.  They have short half lives.  There will be two beta particles each time there is one alpha particle.  There is no protactinium accumulation because the protactinium beta decays.

Like I said, until recently.   In case you didn't notice, that means they waited until a year to start.

Because they just started to work on them.  If they had started 6 months ago, they would be ready or close to ready by now.  This isn't that hard to grasp.

No, they don't.  They are refurbishing old M1A1 tanks for Ukraine.
