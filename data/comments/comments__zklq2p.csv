Neptune’s first launch—*just revealed*—was actually Feb 25-26:  Three Neptunes were launched from south of Odessa at three ships attempting an amphibious landing in Mykolaiv.  All three were shot down by Russia.  But a startled Russian Navy went back to Crimea.
The operators had troubles with configurations, did some tweaks...

About the successful attack on the *Moskva* in April:

> *”At the time of the invasion, we did not have over-the-horizon radars, and Russia knew that. But since the clouds were very low [and thick], a corridor was created between the water’s surface and the clouds—the [conventional] radar had nowhere to go but forward, and unexpectedly reached the Moskva* [which Russians thought was far enough out that conventional radars couldn’t possibly detect it].”

**Roman, former city council member:**  tried to get a job in Russian-Kherson “to spy on the Russian elite.”  But then turned down job offer, “fearing that Russia's FSB security service would discover was former activist for a ‘radical Ukrainian nationalist group.’  

Roman went with his three-year-old son to the children's playground beside Russian administration building to secretly record the car models and plate numbers.

Day 293 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there were no missile or drone strikes so it was pretty quiet yet again. We did have 2 air raid alerts during the day, but they were uneventful, apparently it was triggered because of Russian bombers flying to Belarus. At night Kupiansk was hit by S-300 missiles again, it hit some administrative building, and thankfully I don’t think any casualties were reported.

Yesterday around midnight a Russian base in Bryansk oblast was hit, from the aftermath footage it looks like it was hit by a missile, because the crater looks far too big to be from a drone. Russians reported that every missile was intercepted and no damage was done to anything, but the video which shows a giant crater and some APCs lying upside down beg to differ

I guess the weapon used was a Tochka-U, but I didn’t think we still had any of those. I’m pretty sure we only had a few hundred of them at the beginning of the war, and they were used extensively back then, but we haven’t heard much about them recently, so I thought we ran out of them. I guess we actually still have some left, which is great. 

The news about Patriots being possibly approved as soon as this week is great to hear, they would boost our air defense considerably. I hope it turns out to be true and not just a rumor. If we are now getting confirmation that the Patriots will be given to us soon(ish), then I wonder if our forces are already being trained on them, because it takes quite a lot of time to train new operators and the sooner it starts, the better.

Russians are desperate to take Bakhmut before the holidays so their propaganda has something they can spin before the next mobilization wave hits next month.

>
>The U.S. Defense Department is under pressure from Congress to revise munitions requirements for a hypothetical fight between NATO and Russia to allow more arms to flow to Ukraine, according to three people familiar with the debate.
>
>The reasoning was first used to defer questions about why the Biden administration has not transferred the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (known as ATACMS), an American-made guided missile that would allow the Ukrainian military to hit Russian targets up to 200 miles from the front lines. But congressional aides tracking the debate told Foreign Policy that defense and military officials have said stockpiling requirements mandated by U.S. war plans are behind the American military aid’s slower pace to Ukraine in recent months.
>
>“They’re applying it across the board to Stinger, Javelin, 155 [millimeter artillery], and GMLRS [munitions],” one congressional aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the internal debate. GMLRS stands for Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems. “It’s one of their driving rationales for going at the slow pace that they’re going at.”
>
>Frustration from Capitol Hill over the possible roadblock to assistance comes as the Biden administration announced on Friday plans to send $275 million more in U.S. military aid to Ukraine—one of the smallest weapons packages since the beginning of the war. Some in Congress are worried that recent U.S. aid packages—which have focused on providing artillery ammunition, air defense weapons, and winter gear—are increasingly divorced from the reality on the battlefield and aren’t enough to help Ukraine win the war.

The author is a reporter for the Guardian that interviewed many of the key figures on the Russian and DPR/LPR side during that time, and gives an interesting insight to some of the activities that were going on. It was written back in 2018, so has missed what was going on over the last 4 years, but is still an excellent read. 

One re-occurring motif that comes through - and is the main point of the book really - is that Russia is stuck uncritically looking at their past, ignoring most of it and focusing only on the few 'good' bits. Their participation in WWII (the Sacred War) has become the main rallying cry for their social identity, and they have not bothered to critically look at all the harmful activities that have occurred in their past (i.e. mass deportations of minority populations, gulags and imprisonment and 'disappearances') not only to other cultures but also to other Russians. They appear to have a central focus on how their involvement in WWII is the defining moment of their nation (which Putin and his cronies use as a type of control - and is what they use as an excuse to attack Ukraine - 'the fascists') but it completely prevents the country from really going anywhere.

The author goes on to mention the cheapness and availability of drones and how they can be modified etc. Obviously this was pre-Ukraine invasion. But as Drones are used more and more in real conflict, not just a hypothetical in a book, I find myself wondering about anti drone technology and what creative concepts we will come up with. 

So far I can invision, new anti aircraft guns. I can see this almost like a turret in places commonly attacked by drones. Your electrical grid keeps getting attacked? Let's protect that.

New laser weapons esp specifically designed ones to make the ground difficult to read. Like the camera can't work because its being hit with a laser making it difficult to determine positioning... thus making it easier to hit. I think lasers that cause heat damage will be on the future but not necessarily available in the near term. 

Anti-drone drones. The drone vs drone videos from this war will literally be in a history class one day. 

Weaponized software... don't ask me how cause I don't know... but I do know unless you consistently airlock it at some point someone will somehow take it down with  a bug. May take a long while...

I know there are some weapons on there that combine a bunch of this ramble into their own ideas. Drones that drop anti drone nets for example... bowing has a truck mounted laser weapon... but yeah give me your wildest Anti-drone weapon you can imagine.",False,1670943743.0,t3_zklq2p,t3_zklq2p,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

Having your aid being covert gives you plausible deniability in the event that it doesn't work out. This is when you quietly arrange for shipments of AK-47s to end up in the hands of rebels that just so happen to be willing to overthrow the existing government and install one more to your liking.

Deniability is very powerful in international affairs. It prevents damaging your relations with other countries, and when things go wrong, you can always blame somebody else, like the rebels or the arms dealer.

Having overt aid doesn't give you deniability- obviously. Everyone knows that advanced stuff is going out and who it's going to. It is very damaging to relations with some countries, but the immediate political gains outweigh the risks. Being overt with your donations of  advanced weapons systems has another advantage- it makes it unlikely that the belligerents will think that your new weapon is being used by you as an act of war.

Us announcing that we have Patriot (if we ever give them that) will mean that Russia will know that Ukraine has it, and that if they get shot down by Patriot, it will be Ukraine doing it and not NATO.

>Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned NATO on Tuesday against providing Ukraine with Patriot missile defence systems, denouncing the alliance as a ""criminal entity"" for delivering arms to what he called ""extremist regimes"".

>""If, as (NATO Secretary-General Jens) Stoltenberg hinted, NATO were to supply the Ukrainian fanatics with Patriot systems along with NATO personnel, they would immediately become a legitimate target of our armed forces,"" Medvedev wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

>It was not clear from his message whether he was referring to Patriot systems, Ukrainian forces or NATO personnel becoming a target.

The key phrase here is **with NATO personnel**. 

If we are sending Patriots, then it means we have been training Ukrainians to operate them, and UA is now able to integrate Patriot systems with their other air defense systems.

In case you've missed it, there have been several announcements lately from Ukraine about how they have set up and activated several NATO operation systems.

NATO weapons systems are designed to be operate as a fully integrated system, with all parts working together in a unified manner. Much of Ukraine's equipment is not compatible with this, and they have been working on shifting to NATO military interoperability as they deplete their old Soviet equipment.

Bakhmut seems trapped in a propaganda war, with Wagner wanting a win to prove their brutal tactics more than any sense of geography of the city. The surrounding front has changed and the city (what's left of it) isn't as important as it was. But Wagner pursues anyway, against better judgement, deeming a win would make the cost worth it. But that win is a political win within Russia, not a strategic win for the war. 

The consensus is that Ukraine is allowing them to get themselves killed for Prigozhin's folly, continuing to hold the line but willing to retreat if required, and trying not to get killed doing it. 

I admit to being invested in the idea of Wagner failing, but am more interested in Ukraine inflicting casualties and minimizing losses doing so, because the city itself is now destroyed anyway.

Sure, the 100k dead might be exaggerated; Ukraine admits it is an estimate and it is fairly traditional to overstate the enemy's losses and understate your own. But other estimates aren't that far off, and there is a lot of other evidence that Russian losses are very high. There is a lot of lost material, and testimonies and leaked phone calles from Russian soldiers who say their entire unit was wiped out. And why else would Putin decide to mobilise.

The Black Sea Fleet is indeed still there, though hardly intact. However, it is fairly useless. Ukraine has anti-ship missiles, so they stay far away from the Ukranian coast. I'm not one of those people who thinks that Russia has nothing left. They have what are reportedly pretty decent submarines, but they are in the Baltic Sea. They will not be helpful in this war while the Bosphorus Strait is closed.

Russian GDP has definitely not increased, their own government expects a contraction of about 3%-3.5%. This is very little compared to Ukraine, whose economy will contracts by about a third. However, this should be put into context. Keep in mind I am not an economist or anything, this is just how I've understood the situation. When the war broke out, the EU was very quick in imposing sanctions (other countries as well, but the EU was Russia's biggest trading partner and therefore the most important). Normally it takes the EU forever to come to these decisions; sanctions on Belarus took almost a year. The sanctions were imposed with two goals: 1) shock the Russian economy and cause unrest in the population so that Putin could not continue the war; 2) show that he had misunderstood the EU and they we were willing to suffer consequences for Ukraine. Unfortunately, the first goal was not met. Since 2014, Putin has worked hard to make Russia 'sanction-proof' and more or less succeeded.

Russia's main exports are gas and oil. The EU could not sanction gas, because we were so dependent on it. So instead, a lot of effort was made to decrease that dependency very quickly. Especially when over the summer Russia proved to be an unreliable supplier by cutting supplies. Because the EU had to scramble to fill the reserves, gas prices soared and Russia made a lot of money. But the EU was pretty successful in cutting gas dependency (more successful than was widely expected), so though we are going to be paying higher prices for a long time, Russia will no longer be making a lot of money of the EU. And gas comes through pipelines, so they can't just start selling gas to another country.

Oil was sanctioned, but these only came into effect at the start of December. This was probably to get everyone onboard quickly and to give countries time to prepare. It might also have been a carrot to Putin: 'if you just stop being a dick, things can go back to normal'.  Because of this, over the summer oil prices were very high and Russia made a lot of money. A lot has been made of China and India buying Russian oil instead, but they do so by forcing massive discounts. At the moment, oil prices are again very low (and there is now also the price cap). Russia's oil industry is also in big trouble. Most of their oil in the hard to reach places, like the arctic. They need Western companies to get there, they don't have the technology themselves. Unfortunately, these companies have all left Russia.

There are also other effects of the sanctions. Russia imports a lot of equipment. There has been plenty of talk of Russia now being unably to properly service their airplanes. This goes for a lot of other critical things as well (e.g. trains). For every modern economy chips are crucial, but most countries that produce them have sanctioned Russia (I think there is only China, but they will not export them to Russia on a large scale, because they need them as well). Russia also already had a big demographics problem. They have a lot of old people that want their pensions and not enough young people to work. They now have a lot less, because of losses/mobilisation/people fleeing to other countries.

So though the west did not succeed in shocking Russia's economy hard enough Putin was forced to stop the war, long-term Russia is still doomed. And this is in years, not decades.",1670938555.0,1670936586.0,t3_zklq2p,t1_j01g7a8,,3,15,0,15,0,0,

Ukraine has been following the NATO playbook for fighting the Russian military perfectly. They've had victory after victory, *and they've been doing it with NATO's fucking LEFTOVERS*.

We gave them experimental stuff like the Switchblades, because we decided we'd use the battleground as a testing ground.

Ukraine has been beating Russia's ass with NATO's leftovers. Now we're starting to send them real shit: Patriot missile batteries, longer ranged weapons. I'm sure there's other stuff coming soon as well - since the US greenlit attacking Russian military targets inside Russia, there's no longer any reason to hold back on longer ranged missiles for the HIMARS.

There's literally nothing Russia can do to turn this around. They're running so low on artillery ammo they're asking NORTH KOREA of all places for spares.

> First it was Ukraine advancing around Kharkiv while Russia took Bakhmut. Then Izium for Ukraine while The Russia git Bakhmut. Then Ukraine took Kherson but... Wagner forces were sacking Bakhmut.

There really was not that kind of alarmism in this thread. The discussion about Bakhmut was a lot more grounded than ""OMG they're taking it."" It was more aking to ""Hey awesome, Ukraine captured 500 square kilometers of Kharkiv area today, and Russia took 200 square meters near Bakhmut.""

>At some point you have to stop calling it ""advance"" if the location remains a place of the same. Maybe try calling it ""an assault"". The Russia is assaulting the Bakhmut position.

It would be more accurate to say that they are advancing in the Bakhmut area, because they are actually taking territory in the Bakhmut area. It would not be correct to say they have not advanced.

About a month ago, Russia's advances in the Bakhmut area were reversed, and they lost much of the territory there that they had acquired. In the last two weeks they retook all of that territory and have progressed into southern high-ground regions that gave them flanking cover to attack the city itself. Now they are advancing in portions of the city.

>I cannot emphasize how utterly I have no idea what is happening in Bakhmut.

Just watch some daily briefings, and you won't be confused anymore. I only watch 2-3 per week -- literally like fifteen minutes of my time. It's neither a confusing situation or an alarming situation.
