On 1 January, the debt amounted to 10 million rubles, on 1 February it reached 152 million rubles, - according to Rosstat report.

For two months the budget deficit of the Russian Federation  has already amounts to 2.6 trillion rubles (only 2.92 trillion was expected for the year). And then, according to UIF forecasts, it will increase to 6-7 trillion rubles.

What seemed impossible a year ago is becoming a reality. The Russian Federation is returning to the 1990s.

https://old.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/11ktbp5/full_video_of_a_ukrainian_drone_watching_parked/

It shows something we have not seen in some time. Ukrainians are destroying a large Russian armored column, and this one is parked. There are at least 15 tanks plus additional vehicles dispersed around a gully geolocated to the [outskirts of Chervonopopivka](https://deepstatemap.live/#15/49.1385/38.1699), Luhansk oblast.

Chervonopopivka is a key town along the strategically important Svatove - Kreminna highway. It has been [in the news](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/zcrsug/todays_update_ukraine_has_advanced_north_of/) for [4+ months](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/yhoj01/ukrainian_troops_just_3km_west_of_chervonopopivka/). Ukrainians never held it but they launched multiple deep raids into and around it and shelled it to where it would revert to no-man's-land multiple times only to be reoccupied by the next sacrificial wave. 

It's obvious that Russians would not keep 15 tanks on the outskirts as their permanent base. This can only mean that they were there staging for a counter-attack. The area has seen increased Russian activity recently and Russians managed to push Ukrainans a bit further away from Chervonopopivka as well as Kreminna. 

The Russian unit in the area is the 74th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade from Kemerovo. The unit is famous indeed. It was the 74th that attempted the [infamous Bilohorivka river crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Siverskyi_Donets#/media/File:%D0%A4%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%A1%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%86%D1%8F.jpg) last May, losing 485 (Russian estimates) to 2,000 (Ukrainian estimate) personnel, plus 80 vehicles. 

Typically for Putin's 'army', the entire command structure survived and remained in place, the unit rotating back and getting reconstituted with the freshly mobilized. 

15+ MBTs is an even bigger armored fist than what we've seen at Vuhledar. Everywhere else Russia is down to light infantry with heavy artillery, nothing in between. With the entire Russian manufacturing capacity of 20 MBTs per month this is a huge deal. The strongly suggests that Gerasimov had Operation Forget Vuhledar all ready to go, perhaps a day or even hours away.

Day 379-380 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Just after I wrote my last post 2 days ago, the next big missile strike started, so it really wasn’t all that quiet this time. It wasn’t really the “biggest missile strike” as many were saying it was while it was still happening, they just chose to hit many different cities with a few missiles each at the same time, instead of sending a lot of missiles to just a couple of cities. Though they did hit some cities worse than others, especially Kharkiv.

Honestly this was probably one of the biggest missile strikes that happened in Kharkiv. While it was happening, we pretty much lost count of the explosions because of how many of them were happening one after another. At the time we thought that it was close to 20 explosions, then in the morning our governor said it was 15+ missiles, which doesn’t rule out it actually being 20 explosions. The report from our air force said that they only fired 13 S-300 missiles, but it was definitely more, because that’s the only type of missile they use to hit Kharkiv with these days and we heard far more than 13 explosions.

All of the missiles were aimed at our energy infrastructure and this time the damage was actually very serious, the people working on repairs said as much. I guess the fact that we finally got our street lights back on really struck a nerve with the Russians, they just couldn’t stand it, so they tried to destroy our energy infrastructure yet again. Well, even though the damage is pretty serious, and some people still have no electricity, by now most of it was already restored. 

Yes, some people sat in darkness for close to 2 entire days, but by now over 80% of people already have electricity, and by tomorrow it’s expected that it should be completely restored. We were actually one of the lucky ones, who only had to sit in darkness for 12 hours after the strike, but for example people in other sections of my apartment building had no electricity for about 30-36 hours. It was only restored today at 6:30pm, which to be fair is still incredibly impressive, the people repairing our energy infrastructure are just amazing.",False,1678489881.0,t3_11nf1gb,t3_11nf1gb,,0,179,0,179,0,0,

From Telegraph live thread:

Ukrainian paratroopers defending Bakhmut say they have pushed Russian forces back from the crucial road being used to defend the embattled eastern town.

Speaking to Radio Free Europe, a soldier named Nikolai described how Russian troops at one stage had got within 700 metres of the road linking Bakhmut to the Ukrainian-held town of Chasiv Yar, about eight miles to the west.

“Then they were closest to the highway - 700 meters. Now the distance is about two kilometers, maybe more,” he said.

The road is the last way for Ukraine to resupply its troops in Bakhmut, which has been under assault by Russian mercenaries and conventional forces for months.

Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s top advisor, said on Thursday that Ukraine was “holding on” in Bakhmut, amid reports Kyiv’s forces were withdrawing from the town.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 March 2023  


* On 09 March 2023, Russia conducted a wave of at least 80 long-range strikes against Ukrainian critical infrastructure. Russia deployed cruise missiles, air defence missiles in a surface-surface role, Iranian one way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles, and an unusually large number of hypersonic air-launched ballistic missiles during the attack.  

* This was the first major wave of long-range strikes since 16 February 2023 and likely one of the largest since December 2022. Ukrainian officials reported at least 11 civilians killed.  

* The interval between waves of strikes is probably growing because Russia now needs to stockpile a critical mass of newly produced missiles directly from industry  
before it can resource a strike big enough to credibly overwhelm Ukrainian air defences.

All to not stand out themselves as Russians know that their political elite is this way, but if it is normal around the world, then it does not have to become a problem. If a country like Ukraine transforms itself into a fun, democratic country, with rule of law, and is able to deal with its corruption to then become a member of the EU, Russians might sense that they can and maybe even deserve better as well.

Basically it sounds like only the US had the means which isn’t credible to me anyway.

To me it seems more likely that Russia would have done it with the intent on punishing European countries economically this winter. Russia’s goal has always been to make continued support for Ukraine unpopular.

The good news is that they aren't expected to be as good as the agents which were expelled. They also are not going to normally have diplomatic status to hide behind when caught.  

While on the subject of intelligence agents, have you heard of ""Moscow four""? It's pretty funny.  

Julia Ioffe recently interviewed Christo Grozev, the lead Russia investigator for Bellingcat.  

Here's the relevant section from the Q&A:  

>Back to the question of stupidity. In the U.S., there is still this image, especially after the election interference of 2016, of the Russian security services as not just scary, but very capable and cunning and, well, professional. Whereas I feel like your investigations reveal a different side of them, the stupid, messy, slightly incompetent side. What is the more accurate view on the Russian security services? 

>These two qualities are not mutually exclusive. When somebody is working on offensive operations, they could be cunning and professional and be stupid on the defensive side. It’s a syndrome that I call “the hunter cannot be hunted syndrome.” They don’t really pay attention to covering their tracks because they think nobody would dare go after them the way they’re going after everyone else. They feel protected as a group, the way a pack of wolves protects one another. That hubris leaves them exposed to anybody who dares look into their own ecosystem. That’s what I exploited. For example, the Kremlin has excellent hackers who are really a threat to any electoral system in the world but these hackers also use their own last name and their birthdate as a password.

>Yes, there’s that hilarious moment in the film when you talked about “Moscow four,” where you hack a high ranking security officer because his password is Moscow1, which he then changes to Moscow2, then you hack that and he changes it to Moscow3, etc.

>Yes, “Moscow four” is the same thing. Imagine, it’s a deputy chief of the G.R.U., the scariest organization in the world. Would he think that somebody would dare try to social engineer his password?

Analysts think it was likely a remotely detonated underground mine set off by Ukrainian Armed Forces, not a JDAM. It may have been a Russian command post, or possibly also an ammo storage site.

JDAMs are very massive bombs, in the one to two thousand pound range. They are too big for rocket assisted launchers at present, so they have to be dropped from very high altitudes. This is exceedingly unlikely at this time. Ukrainian bombers cannot venture to high altitudes because Russian AA and high altitude, long-range interceptors can snipe them out of the sky. This is why almost all footage we see if Ukrainian jets is very low to the ground. They probably do not have the ability to safely go several tens of thousands of feet up into the air for a quick JDAM drop.

This is something DARPA has publicly acknowledged they are working on. Test footage is on YouTube.

The US is quite far along on the development of cheap unmanned fighter jets that would be controlled by manned fighter jets. Which is why it is so important that the F-35 can act like a miniature version of all the large support planes. 

Drone microfighters have also renewed interest in the idea of airborne aircraft carriers in both large and small scales. One version would be launched from cargo planes and recovered by similar aircraft. Another would replace the weapons racks on manned fighter jets and be launched to increase the effective range and tactical flexibility of manned aircraft. The US navy is even working to field small unmanned stealth tankers to allow for probe equipped aircraft to refuel without risking large manned tankers. 

And of course there is also Rapid Dragon, and anti air-defense and anti-ship tactic which involves using palletized stand-off weapons launched from largely unmodified airlifters to overwhelmed ships and SAM sites with swarms of precision subsonic glide weapons, cruise missiles, decoys, and jammers.

Just take a look at the submarine in world war II. Good example of ruling the waves and then the hunter becomes the hunted. 

With how cheap drones promise to be I think the future battlefield is going to appear like Ukraine with regards to air superiority. Nobody will have it. The US is used to operating with absolute Air superiority on the battlefield. I think the last time US troops came under Air attack was in korea. Funny how voice dictation doesn't know how to capitalize things. Anyways, the likely scenario I imagine is that you will have attack drones and air superiority drones as well as defenses on the ground and on vehicles. I think that you will see certain areas very well protected from drones and the vulnerability comes when you move beyond the superior defenses and then it becomes a question of who can achieve local superiority to cause damage. Look at how the manned aircraft are having to behave. 

Right now we are not really seeing any countermeasures against the small drones, the quadcopters in the like. OR at least I haven't seen anything. But it's not hard to imagine having an automated machine gun engaging the smaller drones. Anything above a certain altitude moving at a certain speed will be engaged and hopefully nothing on the ground could accidentally trigger it for a friendly fire. Friendly hunter killer drones could also move into intercept. I think having a man in the loop directly controlling it is just an artifact of the repurposed civilian drones. I suspect purpose-built drones will be flying themselves with the operator capable of designating a target and then the computer will try to fly the most direct path while evading countermeasures. 

I suspect that the repurposed civilian drone dropping grenades is probably only going to have a limited operational lifespan and will be replaced by something more dedicated as countertrone tech make that mode of attack obsolete.

They are fine for population. They do have many of the same population demographic issues as Russia (lots of old and not many young (the Ex soviet states just didn't have babies in the 90's) but as long as the supply of weaponry and economic support remains consistent from the West they will have plenty of people to man the guns (and woman the guns which is something Ukraine has done well as well) .  

I do wonder on the longevity of the foreign legions within Ukraine but they seem to be carrying on a year into the war and possibly even growing in number. I imagine these will be used as the strike forces in the coming offensives as they should have a good understanding of combined arms warfare and the equipment that is being delivered. 

As for tanks, they are doing ok.  They had around 900 at the start of the war and have probably lost around half of those to 700 or so going by visually confirmed and estimates on top.  They have captured at least 500 from the Russian forces and had lots of old T tanks delivered from their old Soviet neighbours - around 400 to date.  With the new Western tanks on the way, it is likely Ukraine will go into Spring with more tanks than they started the war with.  

Ukraine's front line logistics are run by Western partner companies with locally trained teams and are incredibly good at keeping tanks in the field, far better than the Russians. 

In terms of artillery systems and AA systems they have more and far better than they had at the start of the war.  

Compare all that to Russia who have burned through large portions of their elite troops.  They have used most of their best equipment and are now down to 60 year old refurbished tanks.  They can't field their T14's as they don't work and are having multiple supply issues in producing new stocks.  They are firing way less artillery than they were and shortages of shells to the front line are noted all over.  Without mass artillery for either offence of defence Russian forces don't really have a war doctrine.

Javelin and NLAW are both third-generation platforms. They are ""fire and forget."" No connection to the human-triggered launcher required whatsoever.

We probably have fourth-generation types of technology in development, but the realistic situation here is that we don't have a better version of AT launcher deployed with our infantry today, in 2023. Infantry in the US are armed with the Javelin today. It is the premier anti-tank weapon they can use. Maybe their more recent production variants have better software or performance, but the Javelin is definitely a valuable tool for Iran and Russia to study. The fact that it was designed in the 1990s doesn't change that it can wreck America's best tanks today if they can successfully reverse-engineer and mass produce it.

The problem for Russia and Iran is that it's not a simple or cheap tool to reproduce en masse. That's where the sticking point lies.",1678472355.0,1678471960.0,t3_11nf1gb,t1_jbpbca6,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

That's the means, not the end.

*In and of itself* nobody cares if Russia is strong or weak.  If, for example, they were a close ally of the West then the West would want them to be strong.

The reason that the West needs Russia to be weakened is because Russia is on an imperialist march with designs of reshaping the European security order, breaking up the NATO alliance, and reestablishing Moscow's control over former Soviet states.  At a minimum.

If Russia are not stopped here and now in Ukraine, then they will start scratching at Poland and the Baltics.  Yes yes I know that a united NATO in its present form would squash Russia in a conventional war, but the whole point of Russia's (failing) plan is to present situations as *faits accomplis* to a disunited NATO who are reluctant to engage militarily with a nuclear-armed adversary.  Had their Blitzkrieg on Ukraine gone to plan, that's where we'd be now just as we were back in 2014 re Crimea and 2008 re Georgia.

Maybe it would be sufficient to simply deflect the bullet towards the ground or to the side so at least the aimed Target isn't hit. 

The Navy laser tests I have seen we're not looking to vaporize the target but delivered sufficient heat to cause the airframe to warp and then aerodynamic forces toward the target apart. If the missile was fast enough there wouldn't be enough time to deliver enough energy unless we are talking stupidly powerful lasers. 

But what you suggest is certainly interesting if you assume that sufficiently powerful lasers can be developed. You basically would have an impenetrable barrier, effectively a dome over the emitter. Anything that pokes above the horizon and can be targeted would be engaged. So I would then ask what kind of defense would it take to be able to withstand the laser until you can close within range to destroy it? Is there any sort of projectile that could close the distance like a hypersonic missile? If not, then would the only possible weapon be a similar class of laser and you would then have to move and emitter of your own within range and hit it before it hits you? Can you make an armor that could withstand hits from such a laser?

The neon knights you're talking about work in sci-fi but armor is always easier to apply to boxes rather than humanoid forms. So I would think that your weapon would still somewhat resemble a tank. I wonder if you could use mirrors to do Bank shots and maybe loft a mirror drone to engage the enemy emitter while keeping your emitter out line of sight. 

Aircraft would be of severely constrained tactical use since they could not risk coming within effective range of such an emitter. But if such a device or light enough for them to carry, that opens up other possibilities.",False,1678484795.0,t3_11nf1gb,t1_jbpr6uj,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Information space shaping is very complex. What we hear from others shapes how we see and interpret evidence. It's part of how the mind works and it's very hard to escape.   

If we have preconceived notions that something is heading in a certain direction, a thing called ""confirmation bias"" helps us notice evidence that support this belief, and further confirm it.  It's very hard to see evidence that doesn't support a belief, because often we don't see how it fails to support it.   This is because we link things associatively, but we do not link things disassociatively.   

So when we see evidence that confirms a preconception, it strengthens that preconception. But when we see evidence that might contradict, it often isn't even linked to the preconception, and thus doesn't contradict it.  So the preconception remains as strong as it was.

It's not until we associate a direct and incontrovertible contradiction that we question our preconceptions, and even then we can sometimes dismiss contraindications as being anomalous.

Putin's continuation of the war after the obvious disaster in the first few weeks is an example of confirmation bias.  He was certain he will win, and while it was obvious to those of us whose bias was for Ukraine to win (and we saw all the signs of the possibility), he missed the fact that he'd completely miscalculated when he still had opportunity to withdraw largely intact.

However, regardless of the size or quality of defensive forces, the defender can extract enormous costs to the attacker in time, resources, and casualties. As was seen at Khorramshahr, the Iranian defenders, outnumbered 4 to 1, still held the city for 26 days. Although the Iranian defenders eventually lost the city, its defense allowed the remaining Iranian forces time to organize and redeploy. Furthermore, the winter rains that followed the battle turned much of the region into a sea of mud and largely halted further Iraqi efforts.

Sometimes they've been ordered by a government, other times like in this case a company makes one and hopes to sell it. The military would obviously do their own testing program before buying it and would then do ""acceptance testing"" on production vehicles before they took delivery. In all cases the company making the vehicle most definitely does its own testing on porotypes and production vehicles. Sometimes in concert with the military, sometimes they have their own separate testing program, depends on the program.

A prototype of the Panther exists you can see photos and a video here:

No those are not renders just in case you try that line, it's a real prototype. As some have pointed out the hull is essentially a Leopard 2 hull but the turret, the main gun as well as the fire control system is all new. If you want the view from a third party this armor cast video does a good run down of the tank and potential pluses as well as minuses:

Yes it is a prototype that is years from production. Yes I agree that offering it to Ukraine is a way to build marketing hype but claiming that there has been no testing whatsoever is not true.

The UN was a unified command structure, or United Nations, that coordinated it's military strategy during WWII to provide a consistent and coordinated operatational strategy across the allied nations to defeat the Axis in order to prevent the divergent strategies that led to ineffecies between the UK, Belgium and France that plagued the Allies early in the war. 
It started as just the western allies but later included the USSR. 

This strategically singular military alliance later evolved into the UNO (today known simply as the UN) to maintain the peace and deal with global issues after the war.
