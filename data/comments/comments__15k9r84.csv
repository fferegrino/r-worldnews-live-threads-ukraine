>5/ Russia also occupies territory in northeastern Kharkiv Oblast and in Mykolaiv Oblast (the Kinburn Spit) — territory that the Kremlin has not formally annexed.
>
>6/ Peskov’s statement implies that Russian forces should relinquish their territory in Kharkiv and Mykolaiv oblasts, but the Russian government has made no indication that it plans to do so and, in fact, is continuing offensive operations to gain more territory in Kharkiv.

KYIV, Ukraine—Like any good boss, Oleksandr Kamyshin keeps on top of production numbers for the factories he oversees. But for Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, it is a matter of life and death: The figures that land on his desk every morning show ammunition output at dozens of Ukrainian factories.

The availability of artillery shells could prove decisive in the next phase of the war with Russia, and the 39-year-old is in charge of boosting Ukraine’s production. Western stocks have been run down by nearly 18 months of fighting, and the U.S. and its allies are struggling to increase production.

Any dip in output and Kamyshin immediately gets on the phone with the factory manager to find out what went wrong. “All of them are on a direct line with me,” he said in an interview.

Ukraine’s sprawling arms industry fell into decline after the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Kamyshin says it is still hamstrung by unproductive practices rooted in the Soviet era. “It’s a complete change of culture,” he said.

Ukrainian military patches hang alongside emblems of state agencies and NGOs in Oleksandr Kamyshin’s office.

Kamyshin has delivered before. As head of Ukraine’s state railway company, he kept goods and people flowing after the country’s airspace was closed in the early days of the invasion. Ukrzaliznytsia’s trains ferried civilians and foreign dignitaries including President Biden, who traveled to Kyiv last year on a train dubbed Rail Force One. 
But bringing Ukraine’s defense industry up to speed in the middle of a war is an even bigger challenge.
Four months into the job, Kamyshin’s efforts have yielded results. In July, Ukraine produced more than twice as much mortar and artillery ammunition as it did during the whole of 2022, he said.",False,1691422075.0,t3_15k9r84,t1_jv6513y,,1,34,0,34,0,0,

* Multiple levels of trenches and emplacements with optimal arcs of fire and coverage
* deeply entrenched bunkers and supply points to protect units and supplies from bombardment and air attacks
* heavy anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mining to protect vulnerable areas, delay rapid assaults, and funnel attacking forces into the teeth of the defense.

That requires planning, effort, and disciplined application of combined-arms tactics and doctrine to deal with it - and even that's still going to make it a grind.

From the US perspective ATACMS are incredibly important for deterring China from invading Taiwan however the US doesn't have that many of them and because apparently the replacement will be created in the next year or two the US is also no longer producing ATACMS. 

In terms of the Ukrainian war the US probably wouldn't be willing to give that many and in big wars quantity matters. ATACMS aren't quite as useful as storm shadows and 50-100 ATACMS may be used to hit some logistical hubs, command centers and ammo depots but they wouldn't fundamentally shift the balance on the field. The single most useful thing for Ukraine right now is lots of artillery and AA. 

Personally I don't agree with the US's logic and even if ATACMS aren't a ""game changer"" they're still worth sending. Also NOT sending ATACMS won't suddenly cause a bunch of 155mm shells to materialize out of nowhere so it's not really a case of ""if X is sent then Y can't be sent."" The US seems to have decided that the amount ATACMS would change the battlefield is not enough to justify losing a limited quantity of weapon that is part of deterrence for Taiwan.

First they need to kill Russian ground based air defence. They need lots of equipment to geolocate radars. They need to organise their artillery so it can quickly target emitters. They need more HARM missiles on way more platforms. Find a way to ground launch it, can it be shot off helicopters? Can Brimstone and SMART/BONUS be used in a SEAD/DEAD role? 

More importantly they need anti-radiation loitering munitions and thousands of them. The persistent presence combined with the HARM or artillery snapshots is what will suppress Russian radars. They also need more long range munitions to go after the S-400 type radars. 

They then need to push back Russian jets and helicopters.

Jets are sitting high and out of range of Ukrainian missiles and lobbing long range A2A missiles, which suppresses Ukrainian airpower. Ukraine needs longer range missiles to force these jets low where their radars can't get lock ons. The perfect weapon for this is the British Meteor. They should have a play around and see if it can be launched blind and cued by something like a Patriot control station, given the traveling radars on Ukraines old Soviet jets aren't powerful enough. Perhaps the new AIM-120D could play a role here as well.

Then helicopters. Again it takes being inventive. The key concept is to get MANPADS style weapons behind Russian lines to ambush Russian helicopters or low flying jets. The lines are too heavily defended for Special Forces so unmanned systems could play a role. Can you adjust a 'relatively' cheap drone like a TB2 for air to air combat? Can a heavy lift drone (e.g Malloy T-400) carry a lightweight Remote Weapon System with a MANPAD behind enemy lines and sit it in an ambush position? If viable it would cause havoc.

You then need to target Russian EW equipment and jammers, in the same manner as the radars. Once they're suppressed the front lines are open for Ukraine to massively step up drone, helicopter and fast jet support across the front lines.

To do this though requires the West to become more inventive and innovative with drone technology and to scale it at pace to a wartime level.

The Ka-52s had a brief burst of success recently when the Ukrainians started to carry out mechanized assaults.

Although there's some limits to the guidance systems (they have to be monitored and guided mid-flight to terminal phase by the firing helicopter), that allowed them to stay out of the range of MANPADS defenses Ukraine was using on their slower-paced infantry-level fighting tactics.   Without sufficient short-range/medium-range air defense missiles or air superiority to suppress the Ka-52s, it played right into the Ka-52's advantages.

Once the Ukrainians moved back to attritional infantry-level warfare, that meant the Russians had to bring their Ka-52s closer to the battlefield to find and attack targets, which meant they returned to having to expose themselves to dense MANPADS deployments.

17c17c2926431fe1e81a9c0bd6bb8db6,15k9r84,jv559x1,"Some points to be made here. 

1. It's true that many Russians are in a state of chronic apathy and disengagement from politics which is inexcusable.
2. Punishments for anti-government actions are not consistent. Two protestors arrested at the same rally can get wildly different treatments, from a very minor fine, to having your doors smashed in and apartment raided by cops while they steal your valuables and beat you. (These two cases that happened to my friends and their family). 
3. What starts as a small fine usually doesn't end there. There are many blacklists which mean this person may never work a decent job again. They can end up ineligible for any kind of credit, welfare, aid programs. Kids can be taken away from you. They start small but then they'll just keep coming back year after year, slowly but gradually ruining your life in greater proportions. 
4. It also depends on how influential you are. Organizers and influencers do disappear, get jailed, or die, if they do not leave the country. If you have little to no influence, then it just depends on the mood of the constable, probably. But if you have little to no influence, then your protest is going to do nothing to change anything. 

Russian people undoubtedly bear a reasonable amount of blame for this situation. But just expecting the nation to rise up spontaneously is unreasonable.

A successful uprising needs at least some of these things: (real) opposition politics, military or paramilitary support, freedom to communicate and organize action, or foreign support. Russians have none of these things. Without opposition leaders, there is no goal or plan for post-Putin Russia to fight for, to give one's life for. Without armed support, it is extremely difficult to take on an armed security force numbering over a million people. Without the ability to organize action, people can't rely on strength in numbers to feel safe.

I realise that nuance of the Russian sociopolitical situation is usually not welcome here, but it doesn't help anyone to categorise Russians as unambiguously evil and deranged people. At the end of the day, we can all agree on two things - we need not wait for Russians to rise up against Putin, and Russians will inevitably suffer the consequences of what's happened in this country over the last three decades.",False,1691404092.0,t3_15k9r84,t1_jv52emz,,2,51,0,51,0,0,

> A mirror effect is at work in this late Putin era. The accusations he levels at the West and Ukraine—aggression, fascism, nuclear threats—become his own actions. Russian-pulverized Mariupol in Ukraine in 2023 looks like nothing so much as Nazi-pulverized Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in 1943.

> The vindictive fever churning inside the Russian leader came to a head on the eve of the war in Ukraine. The loss of Crimea, in particular, as the Soviet Union broke up was a festering wound because of the widespread Russian sentiment that it is a core part of the country’s history.

> “Putin was obsessed with justice, as he saw it,” said Aleksei A. Venediktov, whose popular *Echo of Moscow* radio station was shut down soon after the war began. “He told me in 2014, ‘You might not like the annexation of Crimea, but it’s just.’”

> “We did not see the Putin who was on a historical mission of revenge,” said Aleksei A. Venediktov.

> Mr. Venediktov says he knows Mr. Putin well. He believes everyone, himself included, got the Russian leader wrong.

> “We did not see the Putin who was on a historical mission of revenge,” he told me. “We thought he was a corrupt guy from a poor family who wanted yachts and palaces and girls and money. We did not see the K.G.B. officer who thought the loss of the Soviet Union was unjust. We thought he was a cynic. In fact, he was a romantic.”

> Nationalism is not fascism, but it is an essential component of it. Its perennial essence is a promise to change the present in the name of an illusory past in order to forge a future vague in all respects except its glory.

> “History for Putin is an instrument to shape current events. He is absolutely uninterested in historical truth,” said Oleg Orlov, a leading human rights activist for more than three decades at the head of Memorial, which was shut down in 2021.

> Mr. Orlov, 70, is now on trial for “public actions aimed at discrediting the use of Russian Federation armed forces.” He faces up to three years in prison.

Ukraine exports a significant portion of the planet's grain. Its farmlands laying fallow threatens to destabilize a significant portion of the world. I want you to really think about the following points and put them into the context of what this means for us as a species: 

* Ukraine was attacked by the Russian Federation. No other country on the planet has a formal requirement to get involved. 

* In response, the entire civilized world condemned the attack, and the vast majority of countries on the planet have taken steps to materially punish Russia as the belligerent. 

* Russia (probably) has the capacity to kill every single person on earth. 

* China is a net food importer. Their domestic stability hinges on a reliable and cheap grain market. This relatively modest war sends financial shockwaves across the planet. 

* The planet's largest defensive alliance is actively funding a conflict to which they have no formal commitment.

* China is the only economically significant country supporting Russia's invasion in any material sense. This war continues because China allows it.

I don't know if I agree with this fully because everything has a cost, and even though the US military spending is ridiculous it still has a budget.

There may also be other production issues that aren't even directly money-related but still impact the decision.

I can't imagine the US's hesitation is really escalation at this point, honestly, with Storm Shadows already sent and everything else that's been given over.

All the Ukrainians (including Zelenskyy himself) that have been screaming at the top of their lungs for heavy weapons since March 2022 while we spent that time slow-rolling everything coming down the pike. That gave Russia all the time it needed to fortify the occupied territories and now it's biting Ukraine in the ass.

But don't just take my word for it. Here's some classic examples:

Regarding the Patriots, from March 2022: 

""Pentagon officials will not send the advanced Patriot air-defense system to Ukraine, saying Thursday that U.S. forces would need to enter Ukraine to operate it, which is a non-starter for the Biden administration. 

The decision comes one day after U.S. officials rejected a proposal from Poland to have the United States and NATO transfer Polish MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.

“There's no discussion about putting a Patriot battery in Ukraine. In order to do that you have to put U.S. troops with it to operate it,” a senior defense official said Thursday. “It is not a system that the Ukrainians are familiar with and as we have made very clear, there will be no U.S. troops fighting in Ukraine.”

https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/03/why-us-wont-give-patriot-interceptors-ukraine/363042/

Fast forward to December 2022: 

""U.S. close to providing Patriot missile defense system to Ukraine -officials""

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-finalizing-plans-send-patriot-missile-defense-system-ukraine-officials-2022-12-13/

Now, on to the Leopards and the ONLY reason we (the US) agreed to send the Abrams. So much for Europe making military decisions without the US. From Feb. 2023:

""The problem, Sullivan said, was that Germany refused to provide the Leopard thanks unless the U.S. also provided its Abrams tanks.

“And President Biden said, ‘If me providing Abrams tanks, even if it’s not the most sensible military move, will help unlock German tanks to get to the front lines and also will sustain alliance unity, I will do it,’” Sullivan added.""

https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3872456-sullivan-f-16s-not-the-key-capability-for-ukraine-to-battle-russian-forces/

And now, the REAL reason we refuse to send ATACMS. From a August 2022 interview with a former Ukrainian ambassador to the US...

""Jake Sullivan, Yermak’s counterpart in Washington, has established very consistent contact, occuring on a regular basis. It is no longer just the two of them but also, as I recall, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, and the leader of the military forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Negotiations are well underway, but Sullivan has publicly declared his opposition to such a choice [granting Ukraine long-range weapons], and he has reported his opinion to the President.

There is one word here, Escalation. They are dragging their feet because the White House is afraid of escalation. Jake Sullivan, in my opinion, has made a huge error. I believe this block is still in place due to him and numerous other White House aides.""

https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/08/07/interview-why-wont-biden-hand-over-long-range-himars-atacms/

...which gives credibility to this statement:

""I have it on solid authority from a senior source within the U.S. national security establishment that President Biden was actually inclined to provide Ukraine with the desperately needed weapons, but was dissuaded from doing so by his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.""

Now, on to the F-16's. From May 2023:

""Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It's not,"" he said.""

https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-war-latest-military-keeps-advancing-south-zelensky-says-offensive-slower-than-desired/

""Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been “slowed down” by entrenched Russian defenses, President Volodymyr Zelensky told CNN in an exclusive interview broadcast on Wednesday, adding that he wished that Western weapons deliveries had allowed it to begin “much earlier.”

Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett in Odesa, Zelensky said that in some areas of the country his military cannot “even think of starting” attacks, because it does not have “the relevant weapons.”

“I’m grateful to the US as the leaders of our support,” he told Burnett through a translator, “but I told them as well as the European leaders that we would like to start our counteroffensive earlier, and we need all the weapons and materiel for that. Why? Simply because if we start later, it will go slower.”

The Ukrainian leader added that difficulties on the battlefield were now leading to a “slowed down” counteroffensive.

“I wanted our counteroffensive to happen much earlier, because everyone understood that if the counteroffensive unfolds later, then a bigger part of our territory will be mined. We give our enemy the time and possibility to place more mines and prepare their defensive lines.”

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said that while the counteroffensive is under way, the main push is yet to come.

Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar said last month that Ukraine was holding back some of its reserves and that the “main strike” was still ahead.

In any direction Ukraine chooses to attack, however, time is the enemy, Zelensky told Burnett. “The later we start, the more difficult it will be for us.”

As he has done so often since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the president pleaded with Western governments to give Kyiv more advanced weaponry – such as the US-made long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems – now rather than later.

“In some directions it will give us an opportunity to start the counteroffensive,” he said. “In some directions we cannot even think of starting it, as we don’t have the relevant weapons. And throwing our people to be killed by Russian long-range weapons would be simply inhumane.”

He also re-emphasized his plea for American-made F-16 fighter jets. The United States has authorized its allies to begin training Ukrainian pilots to fly those aircraft, but has not yet allowed allies to re-export those planes to Ukraine.

“It’s not even about the Ukrainian advantage in the sky over the Russians,” Zelensky said. “This is only about being equal. F-16s help not only those on the battlefield to move forward. It is simply very difficult without cover from the air.”""
