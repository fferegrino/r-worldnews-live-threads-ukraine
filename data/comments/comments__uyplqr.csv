From CNN's Ivana Kottasov√°

Russia's actions in Ukraine¬†provide enough evidence to conclude that Moscow is inciting genocide and¬†committing atrocities¬†intended to destroy the Ukrainian people, according to the first independent report into allegations of genocide in that country.

The legal report, signed by more than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts, accuses the Russian state of violating several articles of the United Nations Genocide Convention. It warns there is a serious and imminent risk of genocide in Ukraine, backing the accusations with a long list of evidence including examples of mass killings of civilians, forced deportations and dehumanizing anti-Ukrainian rhetoric used by top Russian officials.

The report was put together by¬†New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a US-based think tank, and the¬†Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights¬†which is based in Canada, and is set to release on Friday, with the authors sending copies to parliaments, governments and international organizations around the world. An advance copy of the report has been shared exclusively with CNN.

""We assembled top legal experts from around the globe who then examined all the evidence and they came to the conclusion that the Russian Federation bears responsibility for breaches of the Genocide Convention in Ukraine,"" Azeem Ibrahim of the New Lines Institute told CNN. Ibrahim visited Ukraine in March to gather evidence for the report.
""This is a very thorough and detailed examination of extensive evidence,"" he said. ""What we have seen so far is that this war is genocidal in its nature, in terms of the language being used and the manner in which it is being executed.

The total economic losses to Ukraine caused by Russia's invasion amount to $564-600bn (¬£447-476bn), according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE).  
  
The measure includes direct damage to housing and other buildings, infrastructure and property as well as indirect damage in the form of GDP decline, lost investment, workers leaving and additional defence and social support costs, the KSE said.  
  
Direct losses from the destruction of buildings and infrastructure are estimated at $105bn, with damaged housing accounting for about $40bn of that figure.  
  
The cities of Mariupol - now under Russian control after a long siege - Kharkiv and Chernihiv - both heavily shelled by Russia before its forces withdrew - and Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Donbas where heavy fighting is currently taking place have seen most damage to residential buildings, the KSE said.  
  
Meanwhile Ukrainian companies have suffered $11bn of economic losses, including more than half a billion dollars in the past week alone. More than 200 Ukrainian companies, factories and plants have been destroyed, damaged or seized by Russia, the KSE says.  
  
The KSE says Ukrainians can report the loss of physical infrastructure, including residential buildings, via its website.

It posted on Facebook that ""at about 2 pm, a MiG-29 fighter of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shot down a Russian Su-35 fighter in the sky over Kherson region.""

While the Ukrainian air force contingent of Mig-29 fighters is aging, the arrival of spare parts from other countries allowed it to field more of the combat jets than it had before the Russian invasion, according to US officials.¬†

Today it was a bit quieter than yesterday, but shelling still continues. We were getting shelled during the day for around an hour and then it got quiet for a while. Then 5 hours ago, exactly at midnight, shelling started again, this time it sounded very close to us, close enough that we were hiding in the bathroom until it stopped.

They almost always do shelling at a specific time, for example when Russians were still just outside Kharkiv, they started their usual shelling at 8pm right on the dot, at most there was +-5 minutes variation on when they began. They still shelled us outside of their usual time frames, but shelling was much worse when it was the scheduled one, and not just random.

Today shelling started exactly at midnight, hopefully this is not their new schedule and it‚Äôs just a one-time thing. Although the funny thing is that right after they started shelling us, suddenly Russians reported ‚Äúclaps‚Äù (as in explosions) in their own Belgorod‚Äôs and Kursk‚Äôs oblasts, which at the same time coincided with reports of Russian positions being shelled by our forces.",False,1653703714.0,t3_uyplqr,t3_uyplqr,,0,79,0,79,0,0,

2. Remember Kharkiv, Kyiv and every other city Russia surrounded and could not take.

Ukraine is happy to play the long game here and preserve her military strength. Time and again we've seen clinical examples of cities holding for longer than could ever be hoped and then sally and take ground back.

Be patient, donate what you can, and have some faith in Ukraine.

I'm worried too, I really am. But every bit of logic and planning I do says 'wait to see what Ukraine has in store for their summer'.

And as long as Russia is attriting more than Ukraine, Ukraine is winning, at least as much as is possible in this conflict.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said.

The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause ware sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.

Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine.

He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with Ukraine.

**The Reality Of What HIMARS Rocket Artillery Systems Can And Can‚Äôt Do For Ukraine**

(...)

*From a tactical perspective, MLRS and HIMARS are likely to be generally more accurate systems, even with unguided rockets, than any of the rocket artillery systems that are currently in Ukrainian service. The fact that the same launcher can fire ATACMS gives it additional flexibility and a true long-range standoff precision capability beyond the limitations of traditional MRLS.*

*At the same time, various factors could impose limitations on the utility of any M270s or M142 delivered to Ukraine, especially early on in their service.*

(...)

*Questions of the political optics aside, without precision-guided rockets, let alone ATACMS missiles, MLRS and HIMARS would not necessarily offer the Ukrainian military significant new artillery capabilities over the MRLs it has in service now. Unguided M26-series 227mm rockets would certainly offer improved accuracy and range over the 122mm systems, versions of the Soviet-era BM-21 Grad and the more recently acquired RM-70s, that the Ukrainian armed forces currently possess.*  
  
*However, the longest-range variants of the M26 do not offer dramatically greater capability in terms of reach than the 220mm types fired from larger Ukrainian BM-27 Uragans and cannot reach the same distances that their existing 300mm ones their BM-30 Smerchs employ can. The rockets available for the BM-27 can generally hit targets out to almost 22 miles (35 kilometers), while most of the types that the BM-30 fires can engage threats up to 43 miles (70 kilometers) away. The extended-range M26A1/A2 rocket types have a maximum range of just under 28 miles (45 kilometers).*

When I had to tune out, there was a lot of talk about Russian forces culminating, was this a bad take/assessment?

Ellis spoke directly to Manafort at podium to tell him he has been found guilty of several charges. He did not smile. His attorney Kevin Downing stood behind him.

Now, before you say ""who cares"" you should notice that almost all investments in modern economies are based on international markets and lending, including large infrastructure investments. Say you want to build an electric grid, a bridge, new city plumbing infrastructure, a metro, a nuclear plant, a new gas field? You take a loan with extremely long payback time from a fund focused on infrastructure investments.

Now these funds learn you are not to be trusted. What happens? They demand more  interest or do not give you loans at all. Suddenly your investments become much more expensive ‚Äì or impossible.

The results of defaulting on your loans is not a boom, it's more a slow death of thousand cuts, which will set you back for decades. You have all the time in the world to say ""you see, nothing happens"", but your kids will not have decent schools, and the roads will rot away.

So what will likely happen?

The Chinese will move in like they have done in Africa. They will negotiate extremely good deals from their perspective. They will bring their own people to do the work. They will end up owning a lot of the infrastructure due to defaults and failures to follow the strict deals by the other party. That is if they believe Russians will respect the deals in the future.

>How has the situation changed in the last 14 days?

Asymmetrical warfare is mostly over, it's switched to relatively static lines with artillery doing most of the work.

>By my daily 2-4 minute scroll I am seeing what can be interpreted as Ukraine losing momentum and Russia hammering them.

Nah. Russia has stopped overextending themselves (which led to Ukraine taking back large swathes of territory), and they're advancing at a crawl. It's basically just a switch from a counteroffensive to drive the Russians back, to a more general battle line without much movement either way.

>When I had to tune out, there was a lot of talk about Russian forces culminating, was this a bad take/assessment?

They did exactly this, and are focusing almost entirely on encircling Severodonetsk (slowly). Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned against the cumulative force there, so Russia is still advancing, but very slowly.

>Is this the war entering the classical war phase with offensives and build-ups, where attrition and small gains by both sides drsg it out over months or years to come?

Pretty much, yeah. Ukraine is trying to hold Severodonetsk to stall Russia and deny their goal of Donbass, but by most (all?) assessments it's a losing battle. On the other hand, though, Ukraine's early mobilisation will start to relieve/reinforce the frontlines, and the West has upped the weapons available to Ukraine (now is around the time Ukraine should be starting to upgrade to NATO weaponry, too). Ukraine expects to have enough force to start countering in the next 2-3 weeks (mid-June).

Russia is also defensively reinforcing certain areas (between Crimea and Donbass), and running propaganda campaigns in Mariupol.

The war is in a period of transition, and we're waiting to see if Ukraine can stall the Russian advance (most likely a matter of time), hold Severodonetsk (very, very unlikely, but possible, depending on western weapons reaching Ukraine and especially the frontlines), and also waiting to see if they can build enough military force to retake lost territory.

Current prospects are looking grim at a present glance, but imo Ukraine still has the long-term advantage. Holding Severodonetsk is a hail mary, but it'll be a huge morale blow to Russia's war effort. If it falls, Ukraine still holds the advantage once they can start pushing back.

The thing to keep an eye on is the port blockade. There's a food crisis looming, the West seems to be seriously considering equipping Ukraine with the weapons needed to break the blockade, and it'll be another major blow to the Russian offensive.

The other thing to keep an eye on is whether Ukraine can hold Severodonetsk (currently, no). After Severodonetsk, it will likely become a static frontline with both sides trying to dislodge the other's defensive lines, and the real war of attrition.",False,1653697646.0,t3_uyplqr,t1_ia94l4r,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

I don't think that was really the reason. 

I think it was right-wing Russian nationalists within the Checka, who were content to use the myth of ""communism"" as a propaganda tool to manufacture consent as they perpetuated a covert system of kleptocracy and exploitation.  Over time, this system of narratives wasn't working anymore, so they just staged the ""collapse"", scooped up all the ""public"" resources to privatize them, in order to access western financial markets so they could begin to plunder those as well.

20 years later, they've become very deeply entrenched in western markets, currency manipulation, global organized crime, and influencing governments (and we see this in places like the UK (City of London), Saudi Arabia and Dubai, Israel, Italy, Hungary, Brazil, and the USA).  And we've seen a very strong relationship between bitcoin price-spikes, and various ""financial collapses"" and ""economic crises""; in Greece, Cyprus, I'd daresay they were connected with the Iceland financial crisis, (2008-2011); where Iceland famously ""jailed it's bankers"" (who had Russian mob ties).

They could not have accomplished this had they retained the ""communist"" narrative, because they were sanctioned and isolated from world markets during the Soviet era. (just as they are now, since they revealed that they can not ever be trusted to keep their word, nobody wants to do business with them).

We can probably conclude that much of the bitcoin price movements of the past few months are related to Russian mob/oligarch figures moving their money to try to circumvent or shield themselves from sanctions.  Along with a lot of this hacking of exchanges, and massive theft.  They obviously exercise a very strong influence across the board in most major global newsmedia organizations. Not just RT, but Rupert Murdoch properties as well. (he is either part of their organization, or an ally).

Politically, they're content to exploit far-left or far-right, or outright whacko Q-anon-style narratives, to destabilize other countries, and destabilize and give political nudges here and there to help with election rigging. 

Countries like the USA are especially vulnerable, due to their legal frameworks that allow extremist interpretations, (like the 2nd Amendment on firearms; with Russia donating hundreds of millions to the NRA, or like the 1st Amendment, which has been exploited for decades to justify and protect the spread propaganda and disinformation, and religious extremism). But even closed societies like Saudi Arabia are vulnerable, because it's a no-brainer to spread religious extremism as a destabilizing element in a muslim country. (probably they exploited this technique in Afghanistan to try to justify their invasion and occupation - before they made that left-to-right switch).",1653662176.0,1653661924.0,t3_uyplqr,t1_ia6wxoy,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Russian Foreign policy has been the same for 400 years - expand as eastward as possible to negate the wild steppe and the peoples that raided them, expand as westward as possible to not be directly attackable across the european plain - USSR control of europe up until east germany was a beneficial strategic position for them - defend 300KM of the flat european plain, compared to 1500KM as it currently stands.

In my opinion, Commmunism in Russia was Russian imperialism, communism was a guise.

This war is about nothing more than Russia wanting:

\- A buffer state, Fix it's demographic issues by stealing the population of Ukraine, Get Geographical Protection from Caparthian Mountins, stop what it considers Nato Expansion, Cause a perception or actual western weakness.

These intrests are present due to the geography of Russia, wheather Lenin, Stalin, a Tsar, Putin - the actions have all been exactly the same.

Even a democratic Russia would ""want"" the outcome above, although it might not be as willing to act as barbourous in doing so - it would probably be another territorial dispute that lingers for 100s of years with no action.

Civilization 1 - ""the West"": liberal democracy, open societies, implied balance of individual liberty and security, striving towards meritocracy, when someone needs resources, the answer is open markets and free trade to provide incentives for those resources to be developed and sold. Democracy can not function in an atmosphere of repression, intolerance, or deliberate false information (disinformation). Such civilizations also rely on a functioning system of Justice.


Civilization 2 - Russia: Smash, murder, repress, take things by force. Security is a luxury afforded only to the powerful, and promised to the weak in exchange for their liberty. The incompetent are promoted through nepotism. Lie about literally everything because assertion of truth is part of assertion of power and control by force.  Where a resource is needed, it must be hoarded then provisioned out sparingly so that market forces drive prices up, regardless of how much it harms the overall economy through this constraint. (This does not maximize wealth, but it maximizes wealth concentration). Authoritarianism can not function in an atmosphere of openness and meritocracy. Justice is just one of many other myths used to manufacture consent.

Russia has an appalling fire safety record.  The Russian fire statistics officially recorded nearly 180,000 fires in 2010, killing 13,000 people. On average, fires claim the lives of 35 people daily in Russia. In the United States, with a population over twice as large (USA 313 Mio. vs. Russia with 143 Mio. inhabitants), about 2,600 people died in fires in the reported period. According to Fire Safe Europe information, about 12 people die in fires in Europe every day, or some 4,400 annually out of a population of 502 Mio. for the 27 Member States. Per million inhabitants, there are 10 times more fire deaths in Russia (91) compared to the USA (8.3) and the European Union (8.8).

fb0f41aee122aa3bd23b7d61b09b5b77,uyplqr,ia77dop,"The Kurds have ALWAYS gotten the short end of the stick there.  I don't expect that to change.

(recall that Turkey did not allow Incirclik to be used as a base during the Iraq war, SPECIFICALLY because NATO was trying to leverage Kurdish fighters against Saddam Hussein.  Turkey would rather have their belligerent southern neighbor, Hussein, persist and continue, rather than participate in empowering and arming the Kurds - I think the West grossly underestimates the amount of racial hatred by Turkish Nationalists against Kurds.  And in the context of the Syrian civil war, Turkey objectively helped ISIS because ISIS engaged in a Kurdish genocide).

NATO needs Turkey, due to Turkey's control of the Bosporus. That's had a LOT of value, and if Russia had been free to send more ships into the Black Sea, they would likely not have lost the Moskva, and Odesa would almost certainly be in Russian hands today - or at least still in-process of being overrun. 

The issue is, from the ""NATO Aggression"" point of view: Russia was never very happy with NATO putting nukes, (or having ANY forces, really) into Turkey.  The big controversy in the 1960's and 1970's was Pershing II missiles (short-range ballistic missiles), being ""too close"" to Moscow, and we had to make concessions there.  

The idea (from the standpoint of ""NATO is a DEFENSIVE alliance"") was always that the SRBMs would be a rapid-response counterstrike weapon, while Russia always viewed them as a first-strike weapon.

Well: If Russia was upset about those missiles being in Turkey, they're way more upset about them potentially being in Ukraine.  Yes: Ukraine is signatory to nuclear non-proliferation; but Russia, being Russia - does not have faith in any piece of paper. Because they literally NEVER honor treaties they sign anyway. 

I'm not sure what I expect from a regime-change in Syria (or Turkey taking significant chunks) - but I suppose Turkey might see it as a trade-off for being able to move NATO's resources at Incirclik to Ukraine; Erdogan probably sees that as more of a burden than an asset.  And that doesn't necessitate some ""backroom deal with Putin"". Though it's pretty clear, with his S-400 purchase that there had to be some kind of smarmy handshake behind the scenes.",1653663597.0,1653663287.0,t3_uyplqr,t1_ia6x0zf,,3,6,0,6,0,0,

He points out that ATACMS ammunition production stopped in 2007...To my knowledge there is literally nothing stopping Lockheed Martin from making them again if it needs to.

He compares the system to the BM-27 Urugan that the Russians and Ukrainians both have access to but fails to mention that a lot of HIMARS and M270 ammunition is guided, and therefore more accurate, while none of the Urugan's is.

It's also much easier to hold a strongpoint than to recapture it, so it would make no sense for them to give that kind of fortified territory away just to recapture it later.

The great game is very much alive, the western feelpolitick is propaganda for a western populous that like you say has a non Imperialist or more accuratley non-Realist approach too world politics - thankfully our leaders are ruthless as fuck and realist like they NEED to be - otherwise all these wars and CIA actions since the 1960s would not have happened, or we would care a lot more about wars that actually bring no material, geographic, resources interests.

> [...]The war in Ukraine is not only very close to us because it is happening geographically on our doorstep, but also because we feel for the Ukrainians, for those who fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the ground, and also for those who have found refuge here with us. And it touches us because we feel that this war is not directed against Ukraine alone, but against values and convictions that unite us as a society, that define who we are: Democracy, freedom, justice, human dignity.

>Putin's war is directed against a peace order that emerged from the commitment ""Never again!"" after two devastating world wars. He wants to return to the law of the strongest, back to a world in which the powerful dictate their will to the weaker.

>Let's not forget: this war has repercussions all over the world. I was in Africa this week, visiting three countries and talking to the heads of government and presidents there. Many people there are worried about the war, because they all sympathise with the Ukrainians, but also because the consequences of this war will be felt all over the world, for example when it comes to food security, when it comes to the prices for vital energy supplies. In many of these countries, as many know from their active involvement here, this is by no means assured, and under the current circumstances, of course, all this will become much more difficult. Therefore, it is quite clear to me that Putin must not be allowed to get away with his cynical, inhuman war.

>Hence the tough sanctions against Russia, hence the support for Ukraine, humanitarian, economic and with a lot of funding, and hence also the delivery of weapons to such a war zone. This is something that we as the Federal Republic have never done before.

>I know that this raises difficult questions, politically, ethically, and also on a very personal level, questions which I am sure you are discussing intensively here at the Katholikentag and also in your families, circles of friends and parishes. At the heart of the matter is the question: Can violence be fought with violence? Or, as some people put it: Can peace only be achieved without weapons? It is clear that such questions may and must be discussed. We must treat the different views with respect, no matter how much war and its terrible consequences agitate us.
But I also say: my position on this is clear. We have decided to stand by the victim of this war of aggression so that injustice does not triumph over right, so that brute force does not prevail as a means of politics. Peace does not come from violent submission; justice is the prerequisite for peace. This is how Bishop Franz-Josef Overbeck put it recently when he rejected unconditional non-violence for himself and instead called for the overcoming of violence through justice.
