Never knowing where the next strike will be, where the next round of violence is heading. ""God, let us live, please,"" they're thinking to themselves.

And somewhere, at this same moment, a Russian soldier is feeling real fear that he's never going home, that he'll never see his family or his friends or his home again. Afraid he's going to die in a foreign country fighting for something he has no control over. ""God, please let me live,"" he's thinking to himself. 

People who are breathing right now will be dead in a few hours or days or weeks. Entire lives with dreams and aspirations and desires and memories and love and joy will be snuffed out forever, and their loved ones will have to live with that pain.

All of this flowing from one egomaniac who thinks of people as pawns on a chessboard, a game he plays to bolster his power and crush his enemies. Real people are being violently erased from this world for all eternity for what? To satisfy a paranoid, lying tyrant. 

Don't forget them. Don't forget that in between all of these minute-by-minute strategic updates that abstract this horror into terms of warfare between nations, there are normal people like you and me caught in the middle of this, on both sides, overwhelmed with fear and emotion, wishing they could be anywhere else right now. The people suffering these moments would be your brothers and sisters, your parents and friends, your wives and husbands, had you only been born there by chance. 

War, now as ever, is a grievous sin, a crime that's thrust upon people who didn't ask for it and can't avoid it. Think in terms of individual people as this continues on, don't let yourself forget the tragic cost of every random snippet you read. For you, it lasts for a moment.

Yes, Russia have the Numbers, but will they have enough support in the population? I believe Putin when he said he had no other choice: but NOT for the reasons he stated. Putin lost at his own game, Ukraine and NATO played with open hands, warned about a coming invasion, Russian false flag operations failed, Russian misinformation attempts failed. Everything that worked in 2014 failed now. Their only option to not lose face was to go through with it.

Ukraine will fight, there will be no Victory, only suffering. I doubt Russian parents will accept losing their sons over a pointless war with no true justification. The Russian «truth» directed at them from state controlled media is being debunked via the Internet. With an economy heavy burdened already by sanctions, new sanctions will hurt Russian civilians to a larger extent than before. All of this, in combination with the Numbers of dead Soldiers we will see if this is prolonged will not be sustainable.

In Ukraine they fight a total war og existance. If they don’t fight now, they will lose everything they have worked for the last 8 years. They will lose their homes, their country. They have all the reason in the World to keep on the fight, to keep on with the struggle; to never surrender. Just like in Checnya, the people will not allow to be oppressed. 

If Russian forces really try to sieze Kyiv and the Ukrainians keep fighting, it will be another Grozny with more death and destruction. That might be the nail in the coffin for Russian support of the war. As long as NATO stay out and don’t provoke an escalation of the conflict. A cornered animal is dangerous, and the Russian bear now stands alone in said corner. NATO must stay out of it, and starve the Russian economy so they cannot keep up the fight. 

And us? Everyone of us have the power to aid Ukraine now, to aid the common Russian opposed to this war. By sharing the truth of the conflict. Don’t believe in fabricated justifications for Putin’s aggression and avoid sharing information about Ukrainian military formations and activities. We have the option to make an impact, that is the new theatre of war in the age of information.

Sanctions are a good move. Holding out on further sanctions gives us bargaining power if the situation continues to escalate. Unfortunately it will take time for the effects to be felt, but hopefully it will cause further division between Russian citizens and the oligarchy. 

Lots of people want an immediate solution but putting boots on the ground escalates things dramatically at the expense of everyone, especially those on the front line. It seems like we are still gathering intelligence and communicating with other world leaders, and I think that is a good and diplomatic move. 

The reporters asked some silly questions, how can you expect Biden to predict the future about how China will react, if Putin will move past Ukraine, what exactly he meant by a vague threat, or how the stock market will handle it? 

I'm not a huge Biden fan, but people who are on his case for smirking at the ridiculousness of the reporters need to chill. There are more important things to be upset about.

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump tried to dissolve NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water.

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

EDIT2: як доказ того, що вам більше не потрібна віза:

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.",1645743909.0,1645742198.0,t3_t0ndwa,t3_t0ndwa,,0,36,0,36,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

For all of the narrative around Putin being a chess master, strategist, all-round-brainy-smart-tough-guy, he has no competing philosophy for Democracy. Democracy, particularly western liberal democracy, is a threat which encroaches on his ability to operate constantly. His attempts to export the Russian model of governance are largely failing, despite the perceived success, because most people just don't care enough to buy into the narrative his minions project. He is in real trouble and invading Ukraine was, in my opinion, a last-ditch effort to keep a colour revolution from his borders. 

Once he is unable to effect change in Ukraine, Russians will be able to wander across a border and see what types of lives they could have under a Democracy.

Rope me in and have me on the edge of my seat for two months while being completely transparent on sensitive intelligence, ultimately leading up to a Russian invasion on sovereign land? Hell yeah baby lets starve these fucking Nazis and burn that fuckin country to the ground!!! I'll pay $50 dollars a gallon at the gas pump if it means we get to fuck these Russian snow pigs in the ass. It's taking everything in me not to go on a suicide mission by enlisting in the ukrainian army just for the chance to gut one of these fucking bastards.

Yeah, Putin was not expecting such a unified response from the West and such an energized populace supporting their Western leaders until it was too late to pull his microdick out. Especially after the last 4 years, he thought he could keep support for these kamikaze sanctions low through divisive misinformation and he was dangerously mistaken. The reality of those sanctions then got priced into the Russian market and whatever the fuck their snow pig currency is called. Ruby, Ruble? Whatever.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water.

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ. ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ. ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО! ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the original thread this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.",False,1645745691.0,t3_t0ndwa,t1_hyb60sw,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Russian forces took control over the site after a fierce battle with Ukrainian national guards protecting the decommissioned plant, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told The Associated Press. The condition of the plant’s facilities, a confinement shelter and a repository for nuclear waste is unknown, he said.

The U.S. president is fighting a formal impeachment process based on allegations that he improperly pressured Ukraine’s government and may have withheld assistance to push Kyiv to provide dirt on potential electoral rival Joe Biden, whose son used to do business in the eastern European nation.

Taking Hostomel with a surgical strike with paratroops was a key operation, which seems to have been beaten back, which is critical as it keeps the west side of Kyiv open to escape. 

Taking only Kyiv and allowing the government to escape gives the Ukrainian government more time to mount counter-offensives, and leaves Russia in a perpetual occupation of East Ukraine until they can accomplish this. With global reputation at an all time low, and sanctions on the way, they shouldn't be able to sustain this.

As far as strategic geography goes, Russia needs to take up to Odessa to secure the coastal ports. Or up to the Dnieper river past Mariupol at the very least, but this is suboptimal.

Failing either of these, Russia will have to pull back to LPR/DPR's ""russian recognised borders"" and state that they accomplished their goal of saving Russian lives, then try again in a few years. Both sides will claim victory, truce will be called so both sides can lick their wounds.

Here's the thing I'm cautiously hoping for - the Russians have a lot of hardware, but with general mobilization in Ukraine, they are going to have a lot of people available in the coming days and weeks.  As long as we can keep supplying them with firepower, eventually the Russian hardware levels will drop down further and further.

Meanwhile, the Ukrainians will basically be infantry or light mechanized before long in the coming days, but these anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles are designed for individual soldiers rather than vehicles.

If the war drags on long enough, we could see Russians slowly losing out in the face of larger numbers of defenders, and due to the nature of urban/guerrilla combat.  This lifeline of weapons I think is the single thing that will make or break the conflict, if the weapons are proving to be as useful as it sounds like they are.

I wish it to be true for Ukraine, but several circumstances must’ve happened.

1. The MiG-29 was off radar and unaccounted for on the Russian (Intel) side.

2. The MiG would likely have to successfully continue to evade detection (i.e. by flying very low-level) and have to had snuck in behind a flight of several aircraft in formation, oblivious to the MiG behind.

3. The MiG then would’ve engaged several in very quick succession using his IR missiles (R-73) from behind, not using his radar in the process to evade being detected.

4. Even then a miracle should’ve happened.

A MiG-29 carries a maximum of 6 air-to-air missles and several hundred rounds of 30mm cannon ammunition, worth only a few seconds of burst fire.

This “Ace” needed to have a 100% success rate while presented with a 1 in a million opportunity.

i had to look this up to understand the numbers applied in the real world.

but we need to convert 65,000 nSv to uSv which = 65 uSv.

this made me a lot more calm. i didnt convert it at first. but it is a bit concerning definitely.

'Allies recognise that the impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack,' a communiqué from the time read.

It also said Allies' response 'need not be restricted to the cyber domain.'

Warner also said Wednesday that a potential cyberattack may not even be an accident, suggesting Putin would launch one in response to Western sanctions.

'Putin's been pretty clear that one of the first tools he would use to bring economic harm to NATO and America is cyber,' the Democrat senator said. 'Play over that whole scenario, just at a larger level, and all the hypothetical conversations about what will constitute an act of war... suddenly get very real.'

Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

Perhaps he thought that the US would jump into the conflict as eagerly as it went into Iraq.

As it stands now, that all seems to be a huge miscalculation on Putin's part. The question of why rule it out sounds to me like whining that the US is not playing the role that Putin hoped for, and as a result the US and NATO will not take the blame for starting the larger conflict that would have been used to justify Russia capturing other neighboring sovereign territories to provide a security buffer.

From CNN's Tamara Qiblawi and Caroll Alvardo  
  
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ordered a general military mobilization.   
  
In a declaration signed late Thursday, Zelensky said that ""in order to ensure the defense of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and other military formations,"" a broad-based mobilization was ordered, including in the capital, Kyiv and all Ukraine's major cities.  
  
""Mobilization shall be carried out within 90 days from the date of entry into force of this Decree,"" the announcement said.  
The mobilization also instructed ""the Security Service of Ukraine to take counterintelligence measures during the general mobilization.""  
  
It ordered the ""conscription of conscripts, reservists for military service, their delivery to military units and institutions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine"" and other state security services.  
  
At the same time, Ukraine has banned all-male citizens 18-60 years old from leaving the country, according to the State Border Guard Service.  
  
The statement said that following the introduction of martial law in Ukraine, a temporary restriction had been imposed.   
  
""In particular, it is forbidden for men aged 18-60, Ukraine citizens, to leave the borders of Ukraine,"" the statement said. ""This regulation will remain in effect for the period of the legal regime of martial law. We ask the citizens to take this information into consideration.""  
  
Some more context: At least 57 people have died and 169 injured since Moscow launched the invasion, according to Ukraine’s Minister of Healthcare, Viktor Lyashko.   
  
“We’re staying home. We don’t want to leave,” says 24-year-old Andrew who had just learned about the travel ban on Ukrainian men. He did not disclose his full name for security reasons.  
  
“I can’t leave now because last update (was that) was that guys from 18 to 68 … cannot leave borders of Ukraine,” he says. “We will stay here till Russians go home because it’s important to us to stay in our homes,” he added. “We will stay with our government.""",False,1645744905.0,t3_t0ndwa,t1_hyb4934,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Dear Ukrainians!

We heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону.  Ми готові до вашого приїзду.  На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

РЕДАКТИРОВАТИ: ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНА ВІЗА ДЛЯ ПРОЙДЖЕННЯ ПОЛЬСЬКИМ КОРДОНОМ.  ВСЕ, що ВАМ ПОТРІБНО, - це ПАСПОРТ.  ВІЗИ ПРИСПИНЕНО!  ВОНИ ВАМ НЕ ПОТРІБНИ НА ЧАС!!!!!!

For travel, the GND does make efforts to end flying, but it doesn't in any way prevent or discourage people from flying, rather it tries to overhaul other means of transport until flying becomes unnecessary. I don't personally see that ever totally working, but there's nothing wrong with the idea.

Not sure of your background but your history is a bit revisionist in many senses and incredibly naive in every way. 

Yes, Putin was democratically elected as President in 2000. I think it’s wildly naive to assume his following elections were actually fair and representative of the Russian people’s opinions at any time. In all reality they were rigged and he has since then established himself as the lifelong dictator of Russia. He is essentially running the world’s largest organized crime syndicate with his oligarch buddies. 

Power in Russia, especially the vulnerable Russia of the post-USSR collapse, is precisely something you take. It has happened - and continues to happen - in many former Soviet republics and communist states that failed in the late 80s and early 90s. 

The Russian Federation had a glimmer of hope for actual democracy in the late 90s but what actually happened is exactly what happened with all the other former Soviet republics and allied communist states. The corrupt politicians just switched from calling themselves communists and instead describe themselves as democratic. They maintained power as they always do. If you are from an eastern bloc country or lived there for enough time you will understand exactly what I’m talking about",False,1645745913.0,t3_t0ndwa,t1_hyb4lzk,,4,1,0,1,0,0,
