📍“Today, at about 4 o’clock in the morning, drone strikes on two non-residential buildings were recorded.
All operational services are working on the spot,” said Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.

📍“The sounds of explosions were heard in the sky over Moscow. Presumably a drone attack. Residents of different districts of the capital in the South-West and South Administrative Districts reported at least three explosions in the sky ... An explosion is reported on Likhachev Street. In the building where Leroy Merlin is located, the windows on the upper floors were shattered. Previously, it was there that the UAV “flew”,”  — Shot wrote.

📍Fragments of another drone fell near a building on Komsomolsky Prospekt in Moscow, located near the building of the Ministry of Defense of the Ruzzian Federation, — Mash reports. 
Traffic along Komsomolsky Prospekt is blocked in both directions.

There is no information about the victims yet.

Rescuers and doctors, military and police, volunteers and local authorities, businesses that got involved. Thanks to all the townspeople. It is very important to help each other and our city!

Separately, I want to thank those in the world who have already condemned this latest manifestation of Russian evil. People in the world cannot be allowed to become accustomed to terrorist attacks. The targets of all these missiles are not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture. There have never been such terrorists who could overcome the world, and these Kremlin madmen will not succeed either.

We have already started preparing for next week. There will be many different events that will definitely strengthen Ukrainian defense. I thank NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg for promptly convening the first meeting of the Ukraine-NATO Council. In fact, immediately after our conversation yesterday, a date was agreed upon - the meeting will be held this Wednesday. We prepare it meaningfully.

We are also preparing new support packages from partners - everything that brings the defeat of Russian terrorists closer. More air defense for Ukraine, more artillery, more long-range weapons. The recipe for ending the war is obvious: everything depends on the unity and determination of all who value freedom, culture, and life.

At least in the Mariinka direction [Pokrovsk area, NW Donetsk oblast] **RF tanks have Chinese jammers installed**, that jam attacking drones.

> Attention drone operators:

> In the Mariinsky direction, the 79th ODSHBR removed an individual REB device [jammer] from a disabled tank.

> This causes a drone not to reach an armored vehicle, and instead, fall.

> So, should switch to other bandwidths (such as 400 MHz, above 1 GHz, etc.)

> These are Chinese jammers that the Russians installed on tanks *en masse*. They create a “dome” and prevent drones from flying near them.

> Suggestions from Flash:

- Target the drone vertically, ie, down directly [180°] from directly above the target—those Domes have a huge hole in the defense there.

- Want to attack the ‘Dome’ sideways? No problem, to attack from the side, turn the ELRS or Cross Fire antenna horizontal on the Drone.

> [to Russians:] Consider that protection no more 🙂 Amen.

The first is rather unbelievable—mobilized coal miner, captured on first day, then characterizes his treatment in torturous, Geneva-breaking terms that don’t comport to any known information and sounds like propaganda, tbh.

The second account rings true.  **I’m posting it here to unveil that yes, Russians *are* informed about how Ukrainians are fair, humane, and not Nazis.  Here’s an example of them being told.**

And btw, the Russians online commenters are a mix of pro and anti war, but plenty have noted that he was afforded a lawyer, treated extremely humanely, given thorough medical care, spoken to in Russian, and they wonder why he took up arms against Ukraine. 

Background:  Igor grew up in Donbas region, but both parents are Russian citizens.  He went to university, got teaching degree for physics, but stole liquor one night and served a year in prison, got out and fought Ukraine since 2014. Never started teaching career.


> ^(... I've always only been a stormtrooper, I liked it.)

> ^(On August 2nd last year, we went on the assault. One of the machine-gun bullets hit me in the head, went under my helmet. I collapsed. The last thing I remember is my mouth hitting the dirt. I came to and was in a hole. […] It smelled of blood. I looked around—there were four bodies next to me—two of ours, two of theirs. I climbed out of the hole and stood up. I wasn't paralyzed back then. Vision almost gone, I saw the silhouettes of some people, called [in Russian]: ""Bro, give me some water."" One approached me, he examined me, and injected something into my leg. I immediately began to feel better, my vision was restored.)


> ^(I look up—see his patch—it’s the flag of Ukraine.  Then realize, there a butt [of a weapon] in my ear—it’s torn in two—I blacked out again. When I woke up, there were a lot of them [UA soldiers] and my hands and legs are tied with duct tape. One guy, healthy as a feather, picked me up and carried me into a pickup truck. At the same time, my eyes were also tightly wrapped with tape. We were taken to Pokrovsk. There in the basement we talked for six hours. But I’ll be honest—they didn’t scoff at me, they didn’t beat me, they talked to me in a normal manner. They asked where I came from, why I went to fight. They gave me water, made me coffee, fed me. I asked for a smoke—they gave me that, too.  This unit was hardened but humane—I don't know for sure, it seems to be field reconnaissance. They didn't introduce themselves.)

> ^(Then they brought me to the hospital. By then, I was paralyzed, I could not even move my neck. The doctor said I wouldn't even live until morning. In the morning, I woke up and the two guards who were assigned to me saw that I was alive and [apparently had wagered on life]. I hear one say, “the o$& didn’t die—now Ive lost two packs of cigarettes."" I grabbed a lighter and started burning my leg. I could feel it, but I could not move my leg, then I smelled burnt skin but couldn’t perceive pain adequately anymore.)

> ^(From Pokrovsk I was sent to the Dnipro, to another hospital. There they injected me with antibiotics, sewed up my wound, the stitches came out. Then they sewed it up again, then put some kind of staples.)


Then, under questioning, his military actions are discovered.  Then the social media:

> ^(After the hospital, I was transferred to Kyiv, to the Lukyanovka pre-trial detention center, it is in the center of the city. They put me in a cell, I was paralyzed. There were five other people in the cell. One, like me, fought for a long time, the rest were mobilized. Everyone was depressed. They were carried on stretchers for interrogations. In the interrogation room, the male investigator asked questions, the girl filmed. Passed a lie detector. They asked about, killed, looted? By looting i answered the truth: no. But about whether killed ... answered: no. ‘You’re lying’—the polygraph showed.)

> ^(At first, I tried to come up with a story, to save my life. I said that they forced me.)

> ^(But the SBU found a video with me on YouTube, back in 2016, I’m there in ‘Somalia’ [motorized rifle battalion of the DPR, now part of the people’s militia]. I was then in the personal guard of Givi [call sign of the commander of the DPR battalion Mikhail Tolstykh, who died in 2017]. We had been interviewed by journalists and at the end of the video, I had given a patriotic speech: ‘I want you to know both on the other side and on this side, that victory will be ours.’ And the call sign in the credits is my real name. They showed it to me...)

> ^(A delegation of the Red Cross came to my cell. The girl spoke English, she was Indian, we spoke through an interpreter. I dictated a letter through the interpreter to my fiancee Inna, I could not write. The letter was short: ‘Alive, healthy, love, hugs, encouraged, safe, secure. Igor.’ Inna was looking for me—got to all the bosses, to the acting DPR Denis Pushilin, to everyone.)

>> ^([Editors note] Information was published on some Russian Internet sources that after Igor's disappearance, someone self-identifying as SBU called his fiancee. They offered Inna cooperation in exchange for his release [if *she* will cooperate].  The girl refused, went to law enforcement agencies. Investigators charged Igor under the articles Collaborationism and Murder.)

> ^(Everyone always communicated with me in Russian, both at the very beginning, and further during interrogations. Although I am, of course, fluent in Ukrainian. Only the lawyer who was given to me for trial spoke to me in Ukrainian. We read the materials of the case for two hours. The lawyer said, ‘No objection.’  The judge, a woman about 50, retired to the deliberation room and returned thirty seconds later. Sentence announced—25 years. I thought, ‘I'm 30 now, I'll get out at 55, and there's no chance [of early release].’)

> ^(The next day after the trial, they came to my cell, ordered me: ‘Out.’ I thought they would take me to another prison. They put a mask on me, put me in a car.  Later, stopped, got out. I hear, ‘Take off the mask.’ I took it off and I see in front of me is a guy in our Russian uniform. He says, ‘Let's get out of here.’ I could walk, but with difficulty. I leaned on his shoulders and we walked to the car. It turned out that I was exchanged.”)

Conclusion: 

> ^(After the exchange, Igor was taken to Sevastopol. There he immediately called his fiancee, she said that his letter still reached her. In the Sevastopol hospital, Igor was examined and treated. He finally got on his feet after rehabilitation in Yekaterinburg. He says that after what happened to him, he will not return to the army: “I fought for eight years, that’s enough.” He should be retired for health reasons.)

*Everyone notes that his fiancée didn’t try to help him, if it meant cooperation. That Ukrainian system was more helpful than she was.*

We cannot allow people around the world to get used to terrorist attacks. The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture. Last night, a Russian missile – it was an X-22, an anti-ship missile – hit the altar of the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Cathedral in Odesa... One of the most valuable cathedrals in Ukraine. In 1936 it was looted and destroyed by the Bolsheviks. The cathedral was restored in independent Ukraine. And now terrorists are trying to destroy it again. Last night alone, nearly 50 buildings in Odesa were damaged, 25 of them architectural monuments. The historic center. A world heritage site that UNESCO has taken under its protection. The building of the Greek Consulate was also damaged, and this is already the second consular office in Odesa to be hit by Russian terror. Only three days ago, another such attack damaged the building of the Chinese Consulate. Obviously, all this is a global threat. The destruction of cities, the destruction of culture, the destruction of ports that are fundamental to the world's food security. There has never been a terrorist capable of overcoming the world, and these Kremlin madmen will not succeed either.

1. Ukraine is focusing on degrading Russian forces. This is reminiscent of the Kherson offensive.

2. Despite strong defensive setups, Ukraine is still making progress.

3. Ukraine still has a lot of offensive strength in reserve. We don't know if/when they'll use that but it's clear they aren't intending to waste it.

4. The Southern theatre has a LOT of defensive lines but it's a huge area, there are bound to be weak points to exploit at some point.

5. I don't think any significant action will come over the Dnieper. It's bullshit hard to do a full amphibious effort and I don't think Ukraine has enough equipment or training to do it at scale.

6. When something does eventually break, that'll likely be when things accelerate. Could be a month, 6 months or a year.

What news that's coming out of rusia indicates the population due to sanctions and more so the number of casualties.  Also, russia used cluster munitions in the earlier part of the war.  Putin said they still have a lot, but yet with ukraine using theirs, there hasn't been a reappearance as of 2 days ago. Another used up munition?

LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign spy chief accused the United States and Poland on Thursday of plotting to gain a sphere of influence in Ukraine, a claim denied by Warsaw as disinformation aimed at sowing distrust among Kyiv's supporters.

Sergei Naryshkin, the chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), cited unpublished intelligence that he said showed the United States and Poland, NATO allies, were plotting to restore Polish control over part of western Ukraine.

""According to the intelligence received by Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Washington and Warsaw are working on plans to establish Poland's tight military and political control over its historical possessions in Ukraine,"" Naryshkin said in a rare statement released by the SVR.

Poland denied the claim and said it was disinformation spread by Moscow.

""The lies about Poland's alleged plans to attack western Ukraine have been repeated for several years,"" said Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for Poland's special services coordinator.

""The aim of Russian propaganda is to foster distrust between Ukraine and Poland, to undermine PL-UA cooperation.""

Given how volatile and dangerous the security situation would get for NATO had Russia been allowed to push far west towards the Polish border, a plan likely existed which had NATO forces led by Poland entering Ukraine and setting up a security/buffer zone, where continuity of government could resume in Western Ukraine under NATO's protection. 

This isn't the most far-fetched belief either as Putin's intelligence apparatus saw lines on the map where in pre-war, the further east Ukrainians are situated, the more pro-Russian their views skewed. They likely thought Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson would be the easiest to subjugate first. So to that end, it's possible that Putin's circle went through a list of worst case scenarios and likely anticipated the possibility that Poland would formally enter the war and help Ukraine secure a new capital/buffer zone, creating an east/west Ukraine situation. We also know that much of Ukraine's valuable resources are situated in the eastern parts, Odessa was also in the original invasion plans. So if a West Ukraine were to form, they'd essentially be landlocked with no access to commercial ports, exports would all be done via Poland. So, it is still heavily in Russian favor.

Perhaps Wagner starts provocations from Belarus under ridiculous auspices of not officially controlled by RU or Belarus. To see what responses happen. So if things escalate RU is buffered by confining it to Belarus and limiting the size of any exchange, but counting on limited retaliation into Belarus proper.

The general criticism is that despite this NYT journalist being Western-educated and has lived in both Russia and Ukraine (has Ukrainian surname, obviously), he subtly and sometimes blatantly promotes Russian narratives (mistruths/mischaracterizations, projections, outright deceptions) in his authored work, even promoting or parroting Russian propagandaists in his twitter account, and this tweet (in longer form) lists examples,^1 although most are not recent, and none of the examples are linked [so can’t view individual tweets].

But the beef is that NYT holds him out as an “expert” in post-soviet Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and that actual experts exist, who are actually impartial, actual experienced journalists exist who don’t promote the lop-sides views.

Without the ability to see his full history, the real red flag *to me* is that he currently lives in Moscow, meaning that no criticism would be permitted, even though his authored work is for the foreign press, and there is no disclaimer of the [limited ability of objectivity](https://rsf.org/en/country/russia)
 under his NYT profile. 

Is having lived part of one’s life in Russia the qualification of being an expert in Russia?  Then I’m qualified, NYT, am I your new expert?  Or is it explaining Russian mindsets and their outlook to a Western audience the qualification?  Bc anyone can gather as much from reading [old NATO publications](https://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/98-00/diliguenski.pdf). 



This tweet is correct in its implication that he can be a mouthpiece of the Kremlin, as Russian has expertly [duped](https://www.yahoo.com/now/free-media-were-duped-fake-171000196.html) the Western press, [repeatedly](https://time.com/6276130/putins-disinfomation-war-western-media/).^2

NYT is an esteemed publication.  Would they print Kremlin-approved articles?  Yes, [read here](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html) how Russia is able to sneak its narratives in to every sector.  Even the brightest fall prey to their techniques. But as Masha Gressen^3 [writes](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-putin-criminalized-journalism-in-russia):

> Ordinary journalistic activity—indeed, the ordinary details of a young American man’s life—are recast as evidence of espionage. Under Russian law, it may indeed be evidence. In 2012, as Vladimir Putin cracked down in the wake of mass protests, Russia broadened the definition of espionage so that reporting and other professional activities could be interpreted as spying. Contrary to popular perception and common sense, in Russia, “espionage” does not need to mean working for a foreign intelligence service or even a foreign government—under the 2012 definition, espionage can include gathering information for any foreign organization the Russian government sees as threatening the security of the country.

> […]

> The Soviet century has taught us what happens in an information regime of restrictions and fear. Probably the most infamous example of what it does to journalism are Duranty’s dispatches purporting to debunk rumors of a famine in Ukraine. We now know that the famine occurred, that it was man-made, that it killed millions of people—and that it was possible to report on it (a Welsh journalist named Gareth Jones did so, was banned from reëntering the Soviet Union, and was later kidnapped and disappeared while reporting in Asia). In the nineteen-fifties, Salisbury implored the Times, in vain, to append a disclaimer to his articles, indicating that they had been censored. Now there is no such censor, only terror and the near-impossibility of reporting on the ground. How does one fashion a disclaimer for that?

This leads me to wonder whether he is being prevented from writing truth.  Regardless, it is indeed irresponsible for the NYT not to have disclaimer clearly stating his location and why that is relevant.

If this war will go on another 3-4 years, the F-16s matter. They require big investments now (training, setting up supply chains for parts, etc) and they wont be an effective weapon for another year.

But according to RAND, they can make a major difference once Ukraine learns how to use them properly and assuming the West supplies them with long-range missiles for the F-16.

Available evidence suggests it's nowhere this good.  We've heard stories of 5:1 ""or better"" in specific scenarios where Ukraine was getting great kill ratios.  But elsewhere they've just been huddling under artillery fire for months with nothing to hit back with at all.  Even comparing the UK or Norway mod estimated Ukrainian deaths versus Ukraine-claimed russian deaths is in the 2-3:1 range.  I would suspect 3:1 is hopium and 2:1 is at least pretty hopeful.  

(Caveat though, casualties rather than deaths is really the relevant number.  And these often get confused in any estimates or reporting such that the comparison can easily be between the wrong values.  It's also possible that russia will run out of equipment before it runs out of throwaway lives, but they probably just turn to using zerg tactics before withdrawing then.)

A 2:1 ratio is still good and will win the war, eventually.  But these deaths are completely unnecessary if we provided with Ukraine more equipment to win it with instead.  At a guess, 500,000 more russians (give or take a factor of 10) need to die before the war will end.  But the more Ukrainians die along the way, the *higher* that number will become, because russia will still see a chance of winning.

Ukraine may actually be doing much better than the ratio earlier in the war now during their ""attritional offensive"".

China is trying to expand its claims to those waters to build their own bases and steal fishing areas (which they are already doing with their huge illegal fishing fleets) and other resources. Taiwan is also reinforcing its own capabilities and partnerships and is constantly under stress from Chinese incursions on its territory through sea and air.

North Korea keeps yapping and threatening and throwing missiles at the seas surrounding their ''enemies'', China is semi-friends with Russia and keeps trading with them and providing them with dual-use goods that can be used for military purposes, while not throwing themselves completely on Russia's side. India is semi-neutral, not really on one side or the other. They're more focused on themselves, but are wary of Chinese expansionism. Iran is clearly on China and Russia's side as they have no other major allies to speak of to trade with.

Ukraine no longer is in between the west and Russia, they are now reinforcing their western partnerships in order to survive, and are aspiring to join NATO. Finland has given up on neutrality and joined NATO. Sweden has also given up on neutrality and is joining NATO.

Fear mongering then ""we must have peace talks to freeze conflict"". They played the Belarus card a couple of times, Lukashenko moves troops to Ukrainian & Poland border before. Other conflict: Kosovo / Serbia, Taiwan / China, Armenia / Azerbaijan, Iran / many countries. Nuke threats, NPP.

The only ""success"" lately for Russia is Bakhmut, it took over 9 months, some 20 km from 2014 front line. Tens of thousands dead Russian soldiers. The Russian ""winter offensive"" got the result of a couple of km in Bakhmut.

Look at the last months:

* Ukraine liberated heights around Bakhmut, and Ukraine got fire control over Bakhmut.
* Ukraine make advances in the south.
* Coup by Wagner reveal how weak Putin & Kremlin are. Russian army was not able to stop it by force.
* Coup lead to Putin & Kremlin arrested high rank officers, Igor Girkin, etc.
* Numerous attacks on command posts, killing many officers.
* Numerous attacks on fuel & ammo depots.  2 on Crimea the past few days. A couple of weeks ago another big hit on a depot just north of Crimea, where railway hub was also severely his. Hits on fuel dumps inside Russia.
* Hitting bridges and railway hubs.
* Kerch bridges got hit again, resulting in car / truck bridge is almost completely out. very limited traffic. I don't think the railway track runs on fully capacity yet since last attack. 
* Officials recommend civilian to take land base route from Crimea. Bridge was closed 2 times yesterday.
* Numerous reports revealing Russian soldiers lacking artillery support.
* Reports on Russian still lacking equipment, training. Even reports of lacking food / water.
* After Russia blow up the dam, with resulting flooding,there are reports of Cholera among Russian soldiers.
* Russia is losing over 600 pieces of artillery per months during the 2-3 last months. Assuming they also need to train new soldiers.
* New weapons keep be delivered to Ukraine. Eg Cluster ammunition.
* F-16 is on the way, some say a couple of months away. Way sooner than first pridicted.
* New sanctions from EU & US. Targeting sanction evasion.
* Erdogan: Did let Azov commanders return home to Ukraine. Accepted Sweden.
* Putin cannot go to South Africa.
* Their economy is hit very hard, and even the Central Bank acknowledged it. Intr rate is up, while rub is down. Lost half its value in 12 months.

I think he purposely had the US not do much to deter a Russian invasion while publicly declaring one would occur. 

The lack of response to Crimea and Donbas were to goad Putin into over reach, which Sullivan knew Putin would do. 

Publicly telegraphing that this would happen also gave the US a lot of credibility. 

It was clear the Russian invasion would become a quagmire. It would also force NATO partners to reassess their defense spending and increase it. A US policy goal. 

By slow rolling aid Sullivan achieves three things. 

1) Continual depletion of Russian military capacity. In any kind of future war with China, it reduces Russia’s ability to assist China. 

2) the ongoing war forces NATO partners to both continue to focus on defense and to increase the military industrial base. 

3) China sees how horrible it is working out for Russia and that the west is increasing MIC. It also sees that the west is not losing interest and that security commitments to Taiwan are even greater. 

Finally, Sullivan really does worry about edge tail risk and knows this response reduces nuclear escalation risk versus giving the level of aid that would let Ukraine curb stomp Russia.

....because how NATO works isn't all in just the treaty.  Read Article 9 of the treaty:

>The Parties hereby establish a Council, on which each of them shall be represented, to consider matters concerning the implementation of this Treaty. The Council shall be so organised as to be able to meet promptly at any time. **The Council shall set up such subsidiary bodies as may be necessary; in particular it shall establish immediately a defence committee which shall recommend measures for the implementation of Articles 3 and 5.**

The treaty established the North Atlatinc council.  The council comes up with rules on how things like Article 5 work, such as if a NATO country is attacked, the country would invoke it's mutual self defense rights under the treaty, and the council would hold a vote to decide if NATO would help or not.


>Which, if you think about it, must be how the treaty works. If the article required invocation by the attacked

No, it must require an invocation and a formal decision by NATO whether the attack in question justifies an article 5 response or not.  Individual countries are free of course to join in a war on their own, but the collective self defense requirement in NATO is only in response to a formal decision by the North Atlantic Council.  Having individual countries joining in a war and saying it's because of NATO obligations would be a terrible idea and the last thing NATO would actually want.

> If the article required invocation by the attacked, a decapitation attack, in which the head(s) of government were rapidly eliminated, could leave them unable to invoke, and therefore essentially defenseless.

Now in terms of any credible attack on Biden’s campaign?  Zero chance.  It’s just gonna be the same three talking heads like MTG, Trump and Desantis.
