Day 205 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday I was hoping that it would finally be a quiet day, but just 30 minutes after my post, at 3:30am, they did their usual missile strike, so basically nothing changed after all, they still continue to fire their missiles daily. They fired 2 missiles this time, and both of those missiles landed within 1-5 meters from small 2-floor apartment buildings. Four people were injured, including 2 children, but thankfully nobody died.

Those missiles just barely missed, and they were definitely aimed at those apartment buildings, one of them literally landed on the corner of the building and chipped it a bit. The crater from that missile basically excavated the building’s foundation, it was *that* close. If it landed just 1-2 meters to the side, it would have destroyed that building, which only had civilians inside. 

They also fired some missiles at us today, it happened at 1:50am, and it was again just 2 missiles. This time, unlike yesterday, we did get an alert before the missiles made it to Kharkiv, people saw those missiles launching in Belgorod from our side of the border, so we had a telegram post as well, and it came before the air raid alert. Not sure where they were firing them from this time, but if we could see it, then it probably was one of their usual spots.

That shelling in Valuyki yesterday is actually weirder than I thought it was at first. Russians living there were filming all the explosions, and one of the things they captured, was that there was a weird missile launch from their side. That missile fell down almost immediately after it was fired, and after it exploded their town lost electricity. So they literally destroyed their own substation for no reason, that’s just hysterical. I don’t know if all the other destruction was caused by their shelling as well, but we do at least know that they destroyed their own substation themselves.
 
Russians actually noticed it and were really mad about it, so that was a nice sight. I don’t know if they intentionally destroyed their substation, to say that it was Ukrainian shelling, or if it was an accident, because their weapons are just so bad, but it’s hilarious nonetheless. If it was a false flag, then their own people fucked it up for them, by filming and posting it online almost immediately.",False,1663374287.0,t3_xfgyb7,t3_xfgyb7,,0,152,0,152,2,0,{'gid_3': 1}

- Kremlin-linked Russian private military company Wagner Group has been conducting a campaign to recruit Russian convicts for service in Ukraine since at least July. Prisoners have been offered commutation of their sentences as well as cash incentives.

- This has been reinvigorated, with recently posted video highly likely showing Wagner owner Yevgeny Prigozhin making a recruitment pitch to prisoners. In the video, Prigozhin emphasises that he is only seeking 'fighters for assault units'. Separately, Russian military academies are shortening training courses and bringing cadets' graduation dates forwards. This is almost certainly so cadets can be deployed to support the Ukraine operation.

- The impact of Russia's manpower challenges has become increasingly severe. The acceleration of officer cadets' training, and Wagner's demand for assault troops suggests that two of the most critical shortages within the military manning crisis are probably combat infantry and junior commanders.

Previous announcement only had the phrase 

>The capabilities we are delivering are carefully calibrated to make the most difference on the battlefield.

This announcement now includes the following

>
>https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/world/europe/russia-wagner-ukraine-video.html
>
>The video was uploaded to “Kremlin Whispers,” an anonymous Telegram channel, on Sept. 14. The user who shared it wrote that the video had been leaked a day earlier by an employee of the penal colony to a local VKontakte group, where it was deleted within an hour. HT @sotaproject.
>
>The original video was apparently 30 minutes long. We were only able to obtain an edited version of just over 5 minutes of the speech, which was delivered at a penal colony (ФКУ ИК-6) in the Republic of Mari El, about 400 miles east of Moscow.
>
>We asked @ugail, a specialist in facial recognition, to compare the face of the man in the video with known images of Prigozhin. While Prigozhin's company Concord didn't confirm nor deny it was him, Ugail's analysis concluded they were “highly likely to be the same individual.”
>
>We also asked a voice recognition expert to compare the voice of the man in the video to this one. Unfortunately, the results were inconclusive due to the noisy reference audio. (If anyone has more reference audio of Prigozhin, please reach out.)
>
>We weren't able to determine the exact date of the speech, but a reference to prisoners fighting with Wagner attacking the Vuhlehirsk thermal power plant (Вуглегірська ТЕС) in eastern Ukraine on June 1 suggests it was sometime in the last three months.
>
>The man's claim can be corroborated with reporting by @istories_media, which noted in July that at least 3 convicts from a penal colony in St. Petersburg (ИК-7 «Яблоневка») had been recruited by Wagner and were killed in Ukraine's Donbas region. 
>
>There are also Russian reports that Wagner, alongside DNR and LNR folks, took the lead in the assault on the power plant in Vuhlehirsk. This fighter, talking to Prigozhin-linked RIA FAN, describes the eventual successful attack in a strikingly similar way to how Prigozhin did.

To make more money, you needed more watts. That was the basic math behind the fears of ‘peak oil’. 



Every year we got better at extracting oil and gas. Every year the cost of energy went down. That propelled the enormous economic growth of the 20th century. But the writing was always on the wall that at some point our pumping and depleting the easiest to extract sources first was going to out-strip the rate of extraction technology advancing and recovery costs would go from getting lower every year to getting higher every year. They called that tipping point ‘peak oil’, and it’s arrival would be a calamity for global economic growth, they said. 



We passed that point 20 years ago. It wasn’t a calamity. The doom-sayers who has been warning about the perils of peak-oil didn’t want to admit their mistake, so instead they started coming up with new definitions for peak-oil, but none of them explained why their new peak-oil was supposed to be something people should worry about. Peak production-volume? Ok. That will happen when other sources become cheaper and take market-share. No bad news there. 




Ever since 120 years ago when the worlds great navies started switching from coal to oil geopolitical strategists playing Great Games on their maps of the world have been preoccupied with controlling hydrocarbon rich parts of the world as how you control the world. The British in Arabia. The Americans in Venezuela. The Germans trying to take the Caspian. Etc. Control the oil, control the world, the theory went. 



The theory wasn’t wrong. Cutting oil to Japan for their invasion of China, for example. For a century all of the geopolitical thinkers always put oil in a pivotal place in their strategizing.



But the importance of oil to the global economy is falling precipitously. The importance of energy of any kind to the global economy is falling precipitously. Oil has real competitors now. The fastest growing sectors of the economy barely use any energy at all. Software is a much more likely way to make a billion dollars than steel or chemicals. Computer games are a not insignificant chunk of economic output and developing them barely takes any energy at all.


The double-whammy of economic growth de-coupling from energy production and oil passing the point where from here on out its long-term trend is only getting more expensive while it’s competitors are on a long-term trend of getting cheaper means that controlling the oil is not the end-all be-all that it once was, and that’s getting more true every day.



Unfortunately, way too many people still haven’t figured that out. I’ll put Vladimir Putin near the top of that list. But it’s also way too many of the current crop of geopolitical strategists everywhere. Old habits die hard. They grew up in a world that works in a particular way. Their professors at college told them how the world works. The books they read told them how the world works. But while almost nobody noticed, the world changed.



The global economy not completely freaking out at Russian threats to cut the energy flow, or the actual cuts to the energy flow, is the proof. Oil is still a big deal, no doubt, but it is no longer the end-all be-all of geopolitical positioning and strategizing like it was not all that long ago. And the more people are realizing that the more true it becomes. A lot more people are realizing that.

Three reasons—one is that it’s difficult to supply those citizens with the explosive chemicals needed; two is that there’s a much higher Russian-friendly population percentage there, anyways; and three, the only business those towns have gotten in the last six months are from the occupiers’ families, and since they are personally nonviolent, and with comms largely cut, it warps locals into thinking Russians aren’t the bad guys.

>We need to launch a new healthy living campaign. We just need to work on it — not outsource it, not write it off as less important. Men are drinking and they’re going to continue to drink.

>Putin added that in the fight against alcohol addiction, “you can’t ban anything, you can’t just raise prices excessively, [and you can’t just impose] excise taxes.” The correct approach, he said, is to put out “healthy lifestyle propaganda,” as well as to “develop infrastructure for people to exercise and give cultural institutions the attention they deserve.”

I read that and I thought...I thought that Putin is right.

Western countries like to raise taxes claiming it's to discourage people from drinking/smoking and act like they're just concerned for people's health (right...). Japan recently came out more honestly about it admitting that they want people drinking for the tax revenue.

Putin believes the correct way is to educate (though he calls it propaganda...) people about a healthy life style and build infrastructure to help them achieve better health. That's the correct way to go about it rather than putting out punitive taxes that will never stop addiction. Because, you know, *addiction*.

I find it funny I agree with him so much in this regard. This guy knows that he should *encourage* people to stop bad habits rather than try to punish them for it, but then turns out and [arrest people for holding up blank signs](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-ukraine-war-invasion-protests-police-arrest-activists-holding-blank-signs-paper-1687603).",False,1663349599.0,t3_xfgyb7,t3_xfgyb7,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

- Air Superiority has not been achieved by Russia. These aircraft are unlikely to find themselves confronted by Russian superiority fighters. 

- Designed for close combat. The radar evading close air support low flying tactics the Ukrainians are known for are an exact match for this craft.

- MANPADs are not a real threat. Again, this aircraft is designed to and has a track record of, evading and enduring ground fire. It's designed for survivability.

China would like to deepen law enforcement, security and defense cooperation with Kazakhstan. Guided by the Global Security Initiative, we should act on the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to promote the implementation of the Data Security Cooperation Initiative of China+Central Asia. We should join hands to combat terrorism, separatism, extremism, drug trafficking and transnational organized crimes, and ensure the security of oil and gas pipelines and other large cooperation projects and their personnel. We should resolutely oppose interference by external forces and work together for lasting peace and long-term stability of our region.

 -Are 6 rockets to a ""pod"" 

-each has a 200 lb warhead 

-with range of 15-92+ km (9-57+ miles) 

-extremely precise (hit w/in 10 m of target) -cost about $160k/rocket 

An ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) Missile was developed in the '80's as part of a ""deep strike"" weapon to hit 2d echelon Soviet Targets. The missile: 

-is 1 missile per pod (6 ""caps"" on pod are for deception) 

-with a 500lb warhead 

-has a 300km/190mile range -cost $850k 

So, key comparisons: HIMARS can hit 6 different targets with GPS precision, with a 200 lb ""bomb"" for each target, at 50+ miles ATACMS can precisely hit 1 target, at longer range, with a 500 lb explosion.

...

Yeah these are good arguments. HIMARS is more useful in the immediate sense. I've been under the impression that 'the launcher is the same and the missile's just different' and that it was a plug and play upgrade. I didn't know it meant sacrificing 6 missiles for 1, which means less missiles per pod/launcher/whatever. And that price difference is massive too, five times the price. When X dollar amount of aid is approved by the US, does it make more sense to send 10 ATACMS or 50 HIMARS for example? 

Not saying we shouldn't send them some ATACMS along with the package, for special occasions... but seeing these numbers is eye opening, and some things make a lot more sense to me now. The fact that HIMARS is both 5 times cheaper and you can load 6 times more in one launcher is something I didn't know, so thank you for linking this. 

I was guilty for thinking that the US was simply holding back 'the good stuff' for fears of escalation or whatever, but seeing these numbers, and the current state of war, I have to agree HIMARS makes more sense right now, as it seems the best bang for the buck at the present moment.

The problem was that more he believed he was right, the more he tsk tsk his generals. This problem got worse after 1944 when he cleaned house after they tried to blow him up. Those left were either Nazi stooges or spineless survivors unwilling to risk their necks for a war most of them knew was lost.

As for Putin, Kyiv might want to kill him (who can blame them?) but Washington wouldn’t approve.  Forget Gerald Ford’s executive order* forbidding his government from supposedly plotting or committing political assassinations which has been policy to this day. There are two other problems with knocking off Puddin:

(1) potential chaos and civil war in Russia if the only real power figure in that environment is removed. Biden doesn’t want that. Now if Moscow had Putin thrown mysteriously out the window and a junta took over as a result of his snafus, that’s a whole other thing. A headache, but US and Kyiv won’t be blamed for it.

(2) believe it or not, Russia might go even more psychotic in Ukraine or elsewhere as retaliation. I mean how would you feel if Moscow or an proxy of theirs killed the POTUS? Would they fire nukes? No but the stakes could get closer.

Putin's not directly commanding strategy as far as I know - though maybe he is. But I don't think strategy is the issue here. It's more that Russia has shit equipment, shit organization, terrible command structure, etc. It's a weird hobo army that nobody apparently put any effort into, 

If I had the opportunity to eliminate Putin right now, rather than let him live, hoping that his ineptitude would help us, I would eliminate him. The ineptitude of Russian military is systemic, baked in. 

Why? The problem is not Russian strategy or whatever. It's the political will. It is a crime to question this very war in the first place in Russia, which is why all the propagandists are struggling to justify it on TV, saying the 'strategy' is the problem, and not putting blame where it belongs, on Putin himself.... because he's a tyrant who they need to be afraid of, all the time.

Take him out, and... well, I'm not sure. I doubt Putin has ever planned for a successor. All these stories about oligarchs mysteriously dying might be Putin trying to prevent someone from getting too confident that they could be a successor, or it could be infighting so they eliminate each other and can end up being that successor, sensing the end of Putin is near. 

In any case, yeah, I think taking Putin out could end this entire war overnight. It's easy to blame this huge and obvious mistake on a dead man in order to save your own skin when you - whomever that is - takes control. So you use the most convenient scapegoat, promise reforms, and hope the rest of the civilized world stops sanctioning the shit out of you. You pull of of Ukraine and spent the next 4 or so years trying to diplomatically separate yourself from this entire shitshow and maintain some weak air of dignity.

But because you're not Putin who's been doing this for his entire life, you're not as good as it. If you're not assassinated yourself, you'll find yourself in charge of a failed state that can't defend its own borders against Azerbaijan or whatever.

Ukraine's primary goal is to remove Russia from their land, with the minimum amount of pain and suffering for their own population. As a result of that, they are calling for as many weapons as possible. NATO's primary goal is to prevent escalation of the war, and only then remove Russia from Ukraine. And that's where the friction exists. NATO is happy to take a slow and steady approach as long as Russia is being held back/losing, whereas Ukraine does not want slow and steady as it's costing them dearly every day.

The cold hard facts are that NATO is willing to endure greater Ukrainian loss of life to prevent escalation, and Ukraine is willing to risk escalation between Russia and NATO to minimize Ukrainian losses. Both parties are reasoning from their own perspective first, and both have a valid point in that sense.

So when it comes to adding ATACMS, for the Ukrainians the math is simple: we don't have it, it would add a capability we don't have, so we should have it. The US on the other thinks: does the benefit it adds on the battlefield, outweigh the potential risks of an escalation?

Almost immediately afterwards the Ukrainians received their 1st Baktayar from Turkey.  And they deployed it to retaliate against separatist artillery in Donbas.  Ukrianians proved they could consistently destroy separatist units, even those deployed in cities, quickly and effectively without civilian casualties.

This left Russia with two choices (1) either let Ukraine destroy the separatist military on the line of contact, effectively ending the separatist threat to Ukraine and Ukrianian politics; or (2) escalate the conflict in some fashion before the Ukrianians could deploy more high tech weapons like Baktayars that the Russians didn't have an effective answer for.",False,1663375203.0,t3_xfgyb7,t1_ioqee65,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

Crimea and Maiden blew the lid off, without them, who is to say the lid wouldn't blow off eventually regardless?

This is all compounded by Ukraine seeing other Eastern European former SSRs open up and modernise their economies.

TLDR; regardless of which timeline you are on, an underlying hope to be European and modern was increasing, meaning staying under 'Russia's sphere' was not going to be a long term thing. Ukrainians most likely would have liked to do it peacefully and without issues from Russia but unfortunately that was not what happened.

And as mentioned by others, 'sphere of influence' is an outdated concept but Russia has been able to maintain a sort of allegiance in many former SSRs due to a range of factors, most of which being the strength of their military and veiled threats of using it.

af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,xfgyb7,ioqntqb,"There is an interesting historical parallel in my home province of Ontario. 

More than 200 years ago, the European-origin population of Ontario was mostly recent immigrants from the young United States. The reason: cheap land and low taxes. There was also a small number of “United Empire Loyalists” (Americans who had stayed loyal to Britain and who had fled to what was then known as “Upper Canada”), but they were massively outnumbered by economic migrants from the US who had no particular loyalty to Britain. 

Why is this relevant? Because in 1812, the US decided to invade. Their ostensible cause was maritime disputes with Britain, but the real reason was more complex - in part to cut off British support for the Native Americans - but what encouraged them was this: Britain was distracted by Napoleon; and, even more important, they figured the population would welcome them. 

After all, the population was mostly Americans. So why would they not welcome incorporation into America? 

Yet it did not turn out that way - the war of 1812 turned into a forging ground for anglo-Canadian identity in Ontario. 

Why? Basically, the experience of being invaded was so unpleasant, it rapidly turned the population against the invader. The war turned very nasty, with mutual burnings of towns on both sides of the border (the Americans burned Newark, now Niagara on the Lake, during winter - and sent the population adrift in winter, very harsh in Ontario; ironically, undertaken by the few militia from Canada who had rallied to the US side). 

Point is this: war and invasion is a quick way of creating or changing a national identity. Many of the inhabitants of Upper Canada went into the year 1812 thinking of themselves as Americans who lived in Upper Canada, but exited the war thinking of themselves as Canadians.

The whole ""problem"" for the Russians was that they severely miscalculated the level of military resistance they would encounter. Imagine the situation where the Ukrainian government flees and the Russian military is in Kyiv in a few days, and have conquered the whole of Ukraine in two weeks. 

There is no resistance because there is no point in resisting. There is a minimal amount of bloodshed, the Ukrainian people are not happy but civilians keep their head down and don't antagonize the Russian military. The Russian military in turn, not having suffered humiliating setbacks, doesn't feel the need to exert their authority towards the civilian population and massacres and war crimes such as in Bucha and Irpin do not occur. The Russian military in effect keeps their order and discipline because they are never shook badly enough. 

Without any real bloodshed and destruction, the Russians have achieved a ""fait accompli"". Europe and NATO never have time to come up with a coordinated response, the lack of destruction and suffering does not enrage western audiences and their governments don't really have any type of backing for enacting real consequences for Russia. Eastern European countries would of course favour sanctions, but West/South of Europe would be less inclined to harm their economies for something they felt they couldn't change. There would be mild sanctions, but nothing at the level we see today.

The combined lack of international and domestic response, together with the relatively mild treatment of the country by the Russian army, changes the situation drastically. A illegitimate Ukrainian puppet government is established that praises Putin and thanks him for setting the Ukrainian people free. Putin speaks of Slavic brotherhood and unity. Rather than finding the differences between Russia and Ukraine, people look towards commonalities. 

Of course the population will still be repressed. But historically it's always been about 50/50 in Ukraine, between Europe and Russia. Russia now firmly in control, quietly and slowly enacts rules and regulations that pull the country more towards Russia. The primary language is changed in schools, history books are changed, Russian TV is put on prime time and while the Ukrainian language certainly is not outlawed at the start, it's simply discouraged. Russia is content to play the long game and people are allowed to mostly live their lives as before. Europe is kept at bay through energy politics, the Ukrainians are slowly subdued through alternate uses of the stick and the carrot. With enough time and propaganda, enough of the population will identify with the Russian side of the nations identity for it to be stable. 

That was always Putin's plan. And maybe it could have worked. We will never know, and perhaps it was always highly optimistic post-2014 when Ukraine made a choice to move towards Europe. But it does seem that if the Russians had been able to conquer Ukraine with fairly little bloodshed, things would have been radically different, both domestically and internationally.

So in the end, the Ukrainians fully saved themselves. It was their initial and heroic resistance that completely changed the cadence and tone of this war. It ""forced"" the Russians to escalate their violence which created a huge backlash inside of Ukraine and most developed nations against Russia. This allowed Europe to unify and create a coherent response against Russia which rendered their economic warfare mostly useless, and most importantly bought the time for a weapon delivery and force generating pipeline from NATO to Ukraine to be built.",False,1663374127.0,t3_xfgyb7,t1_ioqee65,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In other words, if the fight continues, Russia is going to lose territory.  It's just a question of how much, and how fast.

And more important, Ukraine wants these terrorists off it's land.  And they aren't going willingly.  So of course Ukraine wants to fight.

c2d1b6c47012317c4627a87912185a7c,xfgyb7,iopv09o,"Genuine answer: Ukraine aren't really using cruise missiles.

At the start of the war, Ukraine had several hundred Iskander ballistic missiles but a very limited stock of subsonic cruise missiles, which have made up a large number of Russian launches to date. Although those Russian cruise missiles generally used components sourced from Ukraine - particularly engines and some electronics - they didn't have access to the whole missile.

So the two belligerents are using different weapons systems. Russia is using ballistic missiles, MLRS munitions and a (very limited) number of hypersonic cruise missiles, any of which are tricky to intercept for one reason or another and generally haven't been (think of all the war crimes Russia has committed by dumping missiles onto civilians, nearly daily for the entire war), but also a very large number of more traditional subsonic cruise missiles. That last category are much easier to intercept, and have even been shot down by MANPADS and fighter aircraft. You'll probably see more cruise missiles being shot down by point defence systems like Gepard, and area defences like NASAMS, over time - but those can only shoot things where they've been deployed. There aren't many of them out in Ukraine yet.

Ukraine, by comparison, have instead largely relied on MLRS and selective ballistic missile launches, which are very hard to intercept for one reason or another. I include HIMARS in the MLRS category, but obviously they're a bit different tactically to Grads and other, cheaper alternatives. It's really hard to hit every missile from a Grad volley, and it's technically tricky even to shoot down a HIMARS missile. That's an argument that's been quite well developed on the internet over the last few months.

There are other contributing factors here. Russia has shown clear incompetence at the personal, unit and strategic levels, and that isn't going to help. I think that reinforces the points I made above.

So I guess the two key points are: Ukraine hasn't been intercepting everything Russia has shot down, and has been leaning towards munitions which are inherently harder to intercept just because that's what's available to them.",False,1663363213.0,t3_xfgyb7,t1_iopr528,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Even soft armor pistol-rated vests can have trauma plates in the sternum area to prevent the kind of fatal deformation you're talking about. Since it is usually only an issue with soft armor. And the NIJ tests deformation when rating armor these days. 

Sure. An anti-material round can punch through level 4 plates. Or bend the shit out of level 3 steel plates and kill someone. But I've never known of a anti-meterial .30 cal.

Firing slow methodical shots is also something you do to aim more carefully. You squeeze or press the trigger slowly while focusing on your breathing and heart rate, ease off and let the trigger reset, and repeat. 

The sound could even be a guy trying to zero (calibrate) a new optic. The Russians with the latest AK varient often didn't have electronic sights, even though the snazzy new guns were made for optics integration. It's just as likely that a Ukrainian got a new Russian gun and wanted to put his sight on it. This was common in the early war before western and Ukrainian analysts saw just how poorly built the Russian rifle was. It is also just as likely that a Russian captured a modernized Ukrainian AK 74 rifle and couldn't get his commander to let him use the older soviet era AKs that worked right. So he just took the optic off the older gun to use on his janky new gun, and needed to zero the sight.

 For example of one three Russian warships of its kind in the Black Sea fleet [just got towed into the port at Sevastopol](https://nitter.dark.fail/TheShipYard2/status/1570327407717924866) due to propulsion problems. That's one of those ships that launches those Kalibur missiles at Ukraine. Juicy target. 

Denying airfields and safe harbor ports in Crimea could probably justify the use of ATACMS. But in any case, the link above did sell me on the bang-for-buck of HIMARS vs the alternative. What shocked me is that each HIMARS missile is just slightly more expensive than a single Javelin. I'm not saying Javelins are overpriced, I'm just shocked that individual HIMARS missiles are so relatively cheap, considering what it is they do. 

Since we're talking about costs, both are cheaper than [those tiny little surveillance drones that cost $195,000 a piece.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hornet_Nano#:~:text=Although%20the%20Army%20is%20seeking,as%20much%20as%20US%24195%2C000.) Ukraine was given some. I hope that didn't come out of the budget for HIMARS or Javelins or whatever. As far as I can tell the *development program from 2014* for these is why they each cost the insane amount today. Of course they're impressive for what they do, but drone tech has changed so much in the past decade, and I don't think these tiny drones are even necessary in this type of warfare, while cheap commercial ones (that are still very small) would be fine.

Sorry, went off on kind of a tangent there, but I sincerely *hope* when Congress approves a 100 million dollar aid package, it isn't being stuffed with useless expensive and useless shit like those goddamned Black Hornet drones, just to write them off the books.

There were many causes of the war of 1812. Americans, for obvious reasons, tend only to mention impressment - because of course that sounds better than the actual full range of causes. Also sometimes mentioned is British “interference in US trade” (meaning, enforcing the blockade on Napoleonic France). 

The impressment dispute and blockage - what I shortened to “maritime tensions” - was merely the last straw - in fact, resolved before the war began, though no-one fighting knew that. 

The background to the war, and far more important,  was tensions over the US desire to expand westward, which they felt thwarted by the British support for native Americans; and the natural desire to “complete the revolution” by taking Canada. For short, American expansionism. 

Proof of this lies in the parties that supported the war - the Democratic-Republican party for, and the Federalist Party against. 

The majority support for the war was in the south and west. New England, the maritime states most affected by impressment and blockade, were dead set against the war.",1663382723.0,1663382138.0,t3_xfgyb7,t1_ioqqpua,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

Longer version:  He is a Ukrainian man, who’s been a known Russian-friendly politician, who was feeding Giuliani preposterous Russian-crafted^1 fantasies which were intended to paint Joe Biden as corrupt and thereby sink his chances at even being nominated as the democratic nominee (bc Trump feared his popularity and ability to win).  The story (sorta changed over time) was that while Biden was VP, he pulled strings in Ukraine; specifically, to get a prosecutor fired, for a corrupt reason—so his son’s in-name-only board position at a Ukrainian company, would not be in jeopardy because he was earning millions there, and it was under investigation. 

[Truth is that the prosecutor himself was the corrupt party.  And there was an international effort to have him terminated, led by the EU. And Biden’s recommendation for the termination was so Ukraine could to move past the corruption, to be on the road to a respected democracy—bc corruption had been a primary obstacle in the road to being in the EU and in NATO.]

Giuliani then fed Trump the Dertach fantasies; Trump then tried to blackmail/extort/strongarm Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the imaginary scandal, and only after doing so would Trump give Zelensky weapons.  This caused Trump to be impeached.

The reasoning applies to every single person waging what we know to be an unjust agression of thier own volition.

The guilt of russian soldiers as a direct effect of their actions preclude them forcing ""unwilling participants"" to take active part in the agression.

Spare me of the ""they didn't know they were invading"" bs. When they found out they should have gone home. Not doing that implies willingnes to participate. Six months in, even this doesn't hold water anymore.

At this moment there are ZERO russian soldiers ""forced to fight"". I mean, yeah, there might be some forced to be there, but the moment they do anything else except run home, they are willing participants.

EVERY SINGLE russian/pro-russian soldier in Ukraine, no matter if they commited any atrocities is guilty because of the mere fact that they are there and therefore directly or indirectly cause harm to a innocent party (Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, infrastructure, etc).

EACH of those participating have other options they choose not to take, therefore they are willing participants. Despite the known risks.

Due to all of those choices they have willingly made, it is irrationally to grant them some absolution on grounds of ""naivety"" or whatever.

Ukrainian men forced to march against their brethren that do not take any other options (desertion, surrender, etc) place themselves in the same situation and present a similar danger to Ukraine.

What i wish is irrelevant. I wish people would be rational and able to understand logic, but this discussion is proof of the opposite. 

Not agreeing with the irrational sentiment of showing sorrow for people facing the consequences of their deliberate actions does not imply wishing *indiscriminate pain, etc*. 

Please quote me on wishing that pain on those who do not deserve it.

What is so hard to understand? They have other options beside being in Ukraine. If they are in Ukraine fighting for or supporting russia, they have not taken any of them and are there willingly. I won't even mix the whole committing war crimes in this, even through the presence of those you call ""innocent"" is a direct enabler of those.

>I said that just because you see a dying soldier on a video, it doesn't necessarily mean he was one of those, who did such terrible thing of his own will.

For the last time: that dying soldier is dying because he **willingly** accepted the risk by being in Ukraine. Just because he didn't kill children does not absolve him of any guilt relating to the *invading* part, and thus bringing harm to Ukraine. Even a blade of grass that a russian soldier steps on is damage that is caused ONLY because he is there. Being a soldier can get you killed. You have to accept this risk when you accept being a soldier. Or you desert/surrender/revolt/take any other option you can imagine.

Their unwillingness to stand up for themselves and others, and thus willingly engaging in hostile actions, DOES NOT, in any logical way imposes on anyone else the requirement of showing sympathy. 

You do dumb shit that you know could end bad, you face the consequences. Neither me, nor you are somehow morally obliged to care, or have sympathy for them. Literally, there is no logical reason. It would be if they were not adults, knowingly choosing one path instead of any other.

> Your own ego is so important, that you're willing to ignore the existence and suffering of the people, who had to choose between fighting their countrymen, or dying, while their families were still somewhere in the land occupied by the Russians. 

My ego plays no part in this, my ego has wildly different wishes than we are discussing, regarding this matter.

It's not about my ego or yours. Reality doesn't change based on feelings. It's about recognizing situations and people for what they are, no matter how difficult or unpleasant it might be. It's about reason and pursuing justice instead of giving undeserved sympathy to someone who due to his own acts faces the known consequences. (Beside enabling all that genocide and other small stuff)

> You willingly ignore the cases like Horlivka, where there are no men remaining after Russians forced them all to fight.

There is no hatred in what i wrote, and no reason for hatred to have relevance in this. Not caring about something or someone does not  equal hate.

You are literally accusing me of things i have never said. Quote me on saying they deserve to die.

You didn't provide any. I will repeat myself - you only create imaginary scenarios and apply them generally on every single person fighting on the Russian side. You refuse to admit that there are things outside your knowledge, like valid, not immoral, reasons to stay in the Russian army and fight in Ukraine.

These are the dilemmas that even people, who are otherwise against the war, have to face. And staying in the army doesn't automatically mean they have to go all out killing.

Again, it was adressed before. You are claiming some ""unknown reasons"" for your assertion. Whitout providing evidence or reasonable argumentation that they impact the matter diacussed, while at the same time dismissing the arguments provided and placing (another) unjustified weight on those ""unknown reasons""

What I would do is irrelevant to the discussion. 
Whatever reasoning you keep imagining out of thin air does not dismiss obseved facts. Even exenuating circumstances puts the burden of proof on the one claiming them and so far you have provided zero proof of those changing the circumstances related to the matter at hand.

Beside, you are the one literally creating scenarios while accusing me of doing so. You really don't see the projection here, do you?

>These are the dilemmas that even people, who are otherwise against the war, have to face. 

Yes, that is their dillema to solve. Not ours. And the possible consequence are known.

>And staying in the army doesn't automatically mean they have to go all out killing. They can try to stay hidden, out of sight of other soldiers or commanders. They can try to quietly sabotage the war effort in an attempt to avoid battles.

It changes literally nothing. Extenuating circumstances is not in itself absolution from consequences. See above about the burden of proof related to them. 
Fighting doesn't imply only actively shooting. The combatant status has clear legal definitions. Look it up.

>Your stance is a first step in dehumanizing a whole group of people, a well known tool used by fascists.

Again a beautiful example of a stawman.
Also, this is plainly false, as dehumanizing is a completely different concept, and has no relation with the matter discussed here. But yet again you try to throw words around in an attempt to move the goal post.

I don't imagine reasoning out of thin air. You are the one trying to apply your reasoning to every single soldier on the Russian side, therefore it's up to you to provide proof that every single one of them has done something that warrants your 'consequences'. Which is impossible to do, mostly because there is still not insignificant number of soldiers who actively avoid fighting against Ukraine and try to weasel out of their deployment, within their capabilities, given their specific circumstances.

You are trying to say I have to prove something, when it is your statement, that is general. Therefore you need to provide general proof immune to any single counterexample.
