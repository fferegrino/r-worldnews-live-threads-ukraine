Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 14 March 2023  


* In recent weeks, Russian artillery ammunition shortages have likely worsened to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front.  

* This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action.  

* Russia has almost certainly already resorted to issuing old munitions stock which were previously categorised as unfit for use.  

* A presidential decree of 03 March 2023 laid down measures for the Ministry of Trade and Industry to bypass the authority of the managers of defence industries who fail to meet their production goals.  

* Russia is increasingly applying the principles of a command economy to its military industrial complex because it recognises that its defence manufacturing capacity is a key vulnerability in the increasingly attritional ‘special military operation.’

Day 383-384 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were somewhat quiet, though not from a lack of trying from the Russians, but rather because of their incompetence. From what we could see there were a couple of attempts to strike Kharkiv with missiles, but in the process, Russians hit Belgorod with missiles instead. It’s pretty hard to say if they were trying to intercept something, or if they were firing the missiles in our direction because they use the exact same missiles to do both of those things.

There was at least one report of a missile falling somewhere in Kharkiv oblast around the same time, so I would say that they were trying to hit Kharkiv (or oblast), but hit their own city instead. The videos from Belgorod that were posted yesterday clearly show how one of their missiles hits the ground somewhere in the city or its outskirts right after the launch. Today there was another series of missile launches from Belgorod and one of the missiles hit the ground yet again. 

It’s like they are intentionally trying to hit their own cities, we already knew their weapons are garbage, but this just looks outrageously bad. The people from Belgorod filmed the entire flight path of the missile, and it hits the ground exactly 16 seconds after launch, I’m pretty sure there were reports of explosions in their airport, so what exactly were they trying to target there?

Also, today all the Russian telegram channels are celebrating after they intercepted the Reaper drone over the Black Sea. They see it as a big win over the US, many of them are literally thinking that we won’t be getting any more military intelligence because they shot down one drone, which is just hilarious. It’s not even one of the big recon drones, but they think that the US won't be able to gather intelligence anymore.",False,1678842709.0,t3_11qwaef,t3_11qwaef,,0,93,0,93,0,0,

A Kremlin associate has hit out at Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, claiming that his political aspirations are putting his soldiers in danger. 

Russian political scientist Aleksey Mukhin, a member of the Kremlin-affiliated Valdai Discussion Club, described Mr Prigozhin as a ""prospective politician"" who searches for scapegoats to blame for Wagner's high number of losses in Ukraine. 

He said Mr Prigozhin had failed to acknowledge the support he had received from conventional Russian forces, alienating himself from other Russian battlefield commanders.

Mr Mukhin concluded the mercenary group founder had ""placed the Wagner fighters in danger of encirclement during the expected Ukrainian counterattack"" due to these actions. 

He added that Mr Prigozhin was now demanding Russian forces ""cover his flanks"", and that they might need to put aside their distaste for Wagner's chief in order to prevent more deaths in Bakhmut. 

Mr Prigozhin has frequently criticised Russia's military leadership and accused it of failing to provide enough ammunition for his forces. 

In recent weeks, he and his forces appear to have been sidelined by the Kremlin.

According to preliminary information, MiG-31BM (not the kind that carries Kinzhal missiles, otherwise alert would be countrywide), Su-34, and Su-24MR are in the air over Bryansk/Kursk oblasts in Russia. A total of six aircraft detected. Citizens asked not to ignore alerts.

Authorities plainly worried that people are becoming a bit blasé about these frequent air raids, as so many false targets and false launches of missiles are reported. Russians probably hoping that's true, to take people by surprise.

https://twitter.com/Euan_MacDonald/status/1635556519990132737?t=dfUeYtvsnqpKa7TsA9Fgsg&s=19

Still, experts also say that the Russians are finally running low on missiles - that's why the frequency of their attacks is down, the overall number of missiles fired has fallen, and the mix of missiles launched is much more varied, as the Russians dig deep into older stocks.

Air raid alerts have spread to the whole of the south and east of Ukraine. Reports of air defenses operating in Odesa Oblast. In the south, one missile was launched by aircraft - probably a Kh-59 - and it was shot down. There was also a false target, Telegram says.

> Know that their state won't remember them. Maybe collectively one day a year. It was sheer madness that led them here and now they'll never be back alive. Because madmen wanted to conquer more land, wanted to be called The Great, wanted to show the world that they still can.

It includes a large number of convicts recruited in Russian prisons, who have spearheaded the attacks.

> *Northeast:* Fighting continues in the area **north of Soledar**, with [our] aim beinh to advancee along the M03 route and securing the flanks of the Russians. The **enemy had minor success**. 

> *East:* Also, the enemy is pressing on the western bank of the Bakhmutka River, trying to move the fighting towards the **center of Bakhmut. The occupiers had some successes with that effort, though insignificant.**

> *General situation*: very difficult. The stability of the entire garrison depends on the courage and skill of our soldiers, who operate on the northern and southern flanks of the city's defense. There are **no problems** with this, **but** there are ***a lot*** of **Russians**.  Our soldiers have held them back, beyond what should be our capabilities.  The Russians here are many times superior—in the number of personnel and means of destruction. 

> I will not comment on actions from our side. But we have ‘the who,’ ‘the how’, and ‘the what-with’ to kill enemies; and, there is a plan of what to do next.

>**Ukraine short of skilled troops and munitions as losses, pessimism grow**  
>  
>DNIPROPETROVSK REGION, Ukraine — The quality of Ukraine’s military force, once considered a substantial advantage over Russia, has been degraded by a year of casualties that have taken many of the most experienced fighters off the battlefield, leading some Ukrainian officials to question Kyiv’s readiness to mount a much-anticipated spring offensive.  
>  
>U.S. and European officials have estimated that as many as 120,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the start of Russia’s invasion early last year, compared with about 200,000 on the Russian side, which has a much larger military and roughly triple the population from which to draw conscripts. Ukraine keeps its running casualty numbers secret, even from its staunchest Western supporters.  
>  
>Statistics aside, an influx of inexperienced draftees, brought in to plug the losses, has changed the profile of the Ukrainian force, which is also suffering from basic shortages of ammunition, including artillery shells and mortar bombs, according to military personnel in the field.  
>  
>“The most valuable thing in war is combat experience,” said a battalion commander in the 46th Air Assault Brigade, who is being identified only by his call sign, Kupol, in keeping with Ukrainian military protocol. “A soldier who has survived six months of combat and a soldier who came from a firing range are two different soldiers. It’s heaven and earth.”  
>  
>“And there are only a few soldiers with combat experience,” Kupol added. “Unfortunately, they are all already dead or wounded.”  
>  
>Such grim assessments have spread a palpable, if mostly unspoken, pessimism from the front lines to the corridors of power in Kyiv, the capital. An inability by Ukraine to execute a much-hyped counteroffensive would fuel new criticism that the United States and its European allies waited too long, until the force had already deteriorated, to deepen training programs and provide armored fighting vehicles, including Bradleys and Leopard battle tanks.

I dont think the west wants to defeat russia in the military arena. The west doesnt escalate, it merely responds to russias escalations in in such a way as to make sure that Ukraine is ufficiently supported to withstand Russia. The goal is to ensure that Ukraine cannot be defeated by Russia militarily.

Because the west aims to defeat russia on the economic front, just like Soviet Russia was defeated. Ukraine will not lose this conflict on the economic front as they will be kept afloat by the western economic might. However Russia, with an economy smaller than (only) Italy's (and much much less diversified), is already showing signs of losing the conflict on the economic front. The continuous rampup of sanctions and continuously increasing cost of the conflict have led in January 2023 to a russian governmental budget deficit of 25 billion dollars (a deficit that increased to 34 billion dollars in last february). Russia cannot keep this up forever, it will run out of economic breath sooner or later.

As we have seen in the stalemate of the last weeks/months, Ukraine will likely not be able to beat Russia militarily but Russia also cannot beat Ukraine militarily. The west will probably want to keep it like this as additional (non-reactionary) military aid could provoke a feared uncontrolled Russian military escalation whch, in the worst case, could trigger a direct war with the west.

But on the economic front, it is only a matter of time before Russia is forced to the negotiating table. As time drags on it will become increasingly more difficult for them to bear the cost of this conflict.",False,1678815586.0,t3_11qwaef,t3_11qwaef,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

Bakhmut falls, Chasiv Yar is now the frontline, it's suburbs practically fall by default. Siversk is also left exposed. Chasiv Yar controls the highground and Siversk protects the Ukrainian offense on Kreminna and the route to Lyman.

Putin may then opt to keep Crimea and the parts of DPR/LPR he annexed prior to the invasion. He also believes that Xi may make a surprise visit in Kyiv to share this potential settlement idea with Zelenskyy. 

Kyiv would likely decline, but if this were preceded by some form of Chinese guarantee, and if NATO were to back it with a special exception ascension process that would fast track Ukraine into the alliance, that could be what we see.

Yep, a military collapse is likely to happen this year.  The Russian military collapse has been delayed by the winter and mud seasons and by Russia conscripting 500,000 troops instead of the previously published numbers (300,000?), but without real weapons a collapse is imminent.  Bradleys/Leopards/Abrams are going to absolutely eat through Russian defensive lines.

If you just mean military collapse, it's certainly quite likely to happen soon, quite possibly this year by the looks. Politically, it's a lot more complicated.

There are some facts that should be considered:
- the main power structures and police state (FSB, National Guard, military) are made up members who are very loyal to Putin, and led by his personal friends and most trusted loyalists
- popular uprisings can largely be discounted due to a large portion of the population either still supporting Putin or apathetic, and even if opinion sours, the inability to coordinate or organize, the lack of leaders or opposition figures means unrest can only be spontaneous and sporadic
- large urban centres, particularly Petersburg and Moscow, are mostly still very sheltered from the negative effects of the war, and it's not clear when that will change significantly

There are a few ways a political collapse could happen. Putin could die naturally, he could be ousted, or in-fighting starts happening as the failures lead to Putin starting to scapegoat various factions and their failure to deliver him the results that he wants (a cascade of blaming anyone else). 

The first isn't really worth consideration since he'll die when he dies, nothing much else to say on that. 

The second case where he gets ousted could only really happen at Patrushev's hands, I believe. He is probably the most powerful and influential man in Russia after Putin, former FSB director, current security council chief, and very much a part of Putin's fascist ideology. However he isn't so much shackled to this war as Putin is, and on top that there has been rumors that his son is a potential successor to Putin, so if things go bad for Russia, he has some large incentives to use his influence over the FSB to move against Putin. He would surely not want to do this prematurely however. Public opinion is still seems either content or supportive of Putin and the war. 

If public opinion sours on Putin by a significant amount (say if Crimea gets liberated and other major territorial losses, or if Putin decides to start forcing the big city populations into the army), Patrushev would have a casus belli of sorts to swoop in and ""save"" the country from a leader gone mad. This would still be difficult to organize. He would need to somehow coordinate such an action without Putin's knowledge, or in a way that Putin would be powerless to stop him. Even then, a move against Putin may well result in a harsh response from Putins other loyalists, such as the national guard or the military. As good as it would be to have the national guard and FSB start slaughtering each other, I don't see Patrushev making moves like this unless he's very confident he can pull it off. 

Aside from that, things will eventually degrade to the point that Putin will need to start looking for a scapegoat to blame this all on, especially if Ukraine gets Crimea back. This will be a difficult balancing act for him. Cast the blame net too wide, and he'll risk angry backlash. Cast it too narrow, and it won't be enough. If he hesitates, the economy keeps collapsing and at some point we're back at scenario 2.

The damage to the propeller forced the US to bring down the Reaper in international waters in the Black Sea.""

Didn't see that the Russians lost the jet. If I were to speculate upon very little information (hello, reddit!) I'm guessing they were trying to get cute with the fuel dump and accidentally struck the drone. You don't want any part of a midair collision because there's no way to do that sort of thing safely. It's not like you can PIT maneuver a drone. And it ain't like Spitfires wing-tapping V1's to drive them into the ground. 

My guess would be if they wanted the drone dead, they'd have shot it down. Cannon rounds are cheap. It's not like the Reaper is dogfighting. I'm guessing they were trying to harass the drone and maybe force it to RTB without actually shooting it down and causing an international incident which they just blundered into anyway. 

There were a lot of accounts from the Cold War of how intercepts would be done to harass opposition aircraft short of shooting them down. Basically interrupt them in the performance of their mission. And sometimes accidents happen. We had a P-3 struck by a Chinese fighter not too long ago.

Just because Ukraine hasn't recaptured huge swaths of territory since the fall doesn't mean Ukraine cannot beat Russia militarily. It's obvious Ukraine has chosen to defend over the winter while building up strength for spring and summer offensives. If those go poorly maybe then you could say that but until then we don't know. We need to see how the newly spun up and NATO trained and equipped Ukranian soldiers perform first.

I think Crimea will be extremely difficult to take due there only being two narrow approaches to mainland Ukraine but I could see them taking more of northern Luhansk as well as putting a massive dent in the Russian land bridge to Crimea. Both of those would once again compromise Russian logistics and make their positions in northern Donbass and southern Kherson Oblast much weaker.

Russian offensives over the winter seem to indicate they haven't learned enough from previous mistakes to allow them to gain substantial amount of territory themelsves but even then they do have enough men and resources if they were put to proper use they could be real problem for Ukraine, thankfully there seems little evidence of them fixing their problems to this point.

This is a somewhat strange assumption to make. Bakhmut is on a valley which gives the defenders an advantage for any attacks heading west in that direction. There are plenty of prepared defenses set up between Bakhmut and Kramatorsk/Sloviansk. Sure, Bakhmut falling means Siversk will probably fall, but Russia is unlikely to be able to press a further assault westwards once it happens.

Not to mention that Kramatorsk and Sloviansk are practically fortress cities at this point, with prepared defenses to the scale of several times the extent of Bakhmut's. Bakhmut has been on the frontline for 7 months now. This isn't the early war where maneuver warfare is king and where Russia has Severodonetsk levels of artillery shells - Ukraine has had months to prepare defenses between Bakhmut and Kramatorsk/Sloviansk. Flat fields can also be a problem for attackers because there are meany axes for counter-attacks - which is also why Ukraine hasn't had much opportunity to drive towards Melitopol.

Sure, IF those lines were to fall, then Ukraine would be in huge trouble.

&nbsp;
First, the typical Ukranian soldier holding the city isn't some mobik mook. If they decide they will die defending Bahmut, they will. These are extremely motivated soldiers who embraced the death already. It's pointless to compare to Western military. When was the last time that US or EU army was defending their home. 

&nbsp;
Second, I don't think these thinktanks and generals understand Russian mentality. Russia doesn't care about human losses. They might lose half a million by the end of conflict and just shrug. They are extremely sensitive to symbolic losses. Losing Kherson after annexing it. Failing to take Bahmut after half a year of desperate attacks. This kind of thing creates tension between various factions and power blocs of Ru army. This demoralizes the typical keyboard warrior living vicariously through Wagner telegram channels. When their time comes to be drafted, there will be no excitement, they might even opt for jail time instead.

&nbsp;
Third reason - and there was excellent write-up about this. The geography of the area is extremely tricky. Wagner can't assault UA forces who use river as natural defense in Bahmut itself. Surrounding Bahmut - yes gives them fire control over supply routes. But to physically close the trap they need so much manpower and they will eventually run into real strongholds like Chasiv Yar. Just 100 meters of elevation made Vuhledar almost unassailable to Russia's best troops.

It does make you wonder how Russia pivots away from fascism, someday.  With Nazi germany, basically all the males were dead, the leadership was ended, and the country was completely ruined.  There won't be a march to Moscow like there was to Berlin, so how the hell will Russia change and begin to recover?  It's a mystery to everyone.

Best case scenario is Putin lasts another 5-10 years, Russia is completely destroyed, and the people demand someone who is the complete opposite of him who embraces the west and slowly but surely rebuilds Russia.  

A lot of worse scenarios are possible too, like Putin lasts another 20 years and Russia descends into civil war.  Or Putin is ousted 6 months from now by someone who is 35 years old and is even more hawkish and Russia becomes a forever north Korea with vastly more nukes and mineral wealth to sow evil near and far.

We will never be able to have normal interaction with them, because of their unique national badness.But somehow our view of the Axis nations turned on a dime at the end of WW2, when we wanted them in a united front against the Soviets and China. 

 Have you read about evil deeds by German soldiers and Japanese soldiers in WW2, when Japanese war crimes killed 3 to 14 million civilians?  And Germans probably killed more? Einsatzgruppen murdering Jews at Baba Yar? The German “Rape of Belgium”” in WW1?  The Japanese “Rape of Nanking” in WW2?  Then suddenly in 1946 there’s some kind of transmutation and they are the nicest  people you ever met.

The guy was a crooner, had an audience like...Barry Mantilow or tony Bennett has.  Meaning, old folks.  Like, ages 60-90.  Since he started out Soviet era, he always had a wide audience—he sang in Russian and resided in Moscow post dissolution, but was originally from what is now Ukraine.  His fans span Russia, Ukraine, Easter Bloc, Baltic and the -stan countries, but that fan base was ages 50+.  Probably 70+.  Old people.  Like people who like the *Lawrence Welk Show*.

So several times it happened, that a D-list celebrity in Russia or Ukraine, who is older in years, would be photographed at his concert. The Russians & Ukrainians would print photographs in their gossip & society sections of him backstage hugging these other low-level celebrities who came to see him in concert.

But since they were *not* big stars, they weren’t photographed often.  

And *three times* it happened that one of these D-list celebrities would be in the papers as having attended his concert, *but* the *next* time they showed up in the newspaper, it was a death announcement.  

Despite it being already-old people, and it being several months between the concert and the death, the fact that it happened to 3 people over a year, an understandable rumor/ misguided conclusion began—*going to Kobzon’s concert brings about death.*

Kobzon himself has since died.  The euphemism remains.",1678817468.0,1678817178.0,t3_11qwaef,t1_jc623p4,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

From my experience lurking r CredibleDefense which gets a lot of UA soldier interviews posted all the time, I don't think even the soldiers fighting *in* Bakhmut have a consensus on whether staying is a good idea or not. A lot of interviewees are saying that the situation is actually deteriorating - yes, they have held for an impressive amount of time, but now the GLOCs to the city itself are falling under Russian artillery range. The fact that this has become more apparent is why you're seeing more and more people repeat what more pessimistic defense experts have been saying for weeks now.

If Ukraine's army is worth a fraction of what they have demonstrated earlier in the war, it is that they have anticipated losing Bakhmut and already have fresh prepared defenses west of the city that have not been thoroughly identified and scouted out by Russian surveillance. Additionally, the topography of the region is favourable for defending west of Bakhmut (which is sloped upwards relative to the city). Even experts like Kofman who have literally been to Bakhmut are saying that withdrawing would not be a huge issue, and Russia is far more likely to attack northwards after taking Bakhmut instead of an ill-advised drive towards Kramatorsk. So by this logic Ukraine should not risk losing irreplaceable manpower holding a city where the UA/RU casualty ratio, while formerly extremely favourable for Ukraine, is beginning to diminish as supplies are constrained and the pocket is attacked from more directions.

However, instead, we've seen confirmation of elite units like the 93rd sent IN to Bakhmut, rather than being retreated from the city to save for future offensives. It's hugely worrying because manpower is much harder to replace than Bakhmut is. So why is this happening - is it somehow militarily sound? Well, there is a heavy political incentive for Ukraine to hold Bakhmut, due to how Zelensky has played up its importance - and he has overruled his generals before in other manners such as retreating/not retreating from Mariupol. This suggests that the decision making process of the Ukrainian top brass with regards to the city could have been clouded by his interference. It's a fairly risky gamble to make, and now it's too late to retreat anyways, so we'll just have to see what happens in the next few weeks.",False,1678772858.0,t3_11qwaef,t1_jc5mvgb,,2,14,0,14,0,0,

With a lot of hard work their future was looking brighter. Russia is a backward, corrupt economy that was always surpassed by Europe and the U.S., and China's economy surpassed the Russian one recently too. Putin is not capable of managing an economy, only able to siphon off the money for his own corrupt self and his cronies. Everyone else has to make due with scraps. Putin knows Russia's economy CANNOT change as this would require forgoing draining Russia of its wealth for himself and his oligarchs. Putin can only try to make other countries fail like his so he doesn't look bad by comparison. So much of their efforts spend time trying to suppress the economies of the west and he cannot tolerate a prosperous Ukraine. Belarus is successfully failing along with Russia so his plan there is working well. Now he wants Ukraine the same. Ukraine must live in the abject misery that Russians live in. So it makes sense he uses war crimes to utterly destroy any city he can and kill as many civilians as he can to make sure to keep Ukraine on Russia's level of misery. Putin is like the Taliban in a lot of ways as they share a desire to be sure the citizens get to scrape by with nothing, and he hides billions in siphoned money outside Russia, same with the corrupt oligarchs. 

So if Putin is not outright killed when driven out of Ukraine, then he sure will be when the west rebuilds Ukraine setting them to be really prosperous being closer to the EU and eventually joining. If Putin is still alive at that point then when Ukraine's economy is growing 8-10% a year after all the western investment, leaving Russia and Belarus in the dustbin of failed economies, Putin will surely be killed off then. If Russia somehow manages to to get a little freedom and ends the hostility to the west, Russia could be prosperous too potentially, but to do that Putin and the oligarchs can't siphon off Russia's meager wealth and that is something Putin will never allow.",False,1678782100.0,t3_11qwaef,t1_jc5wrt7,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

There’s a range of insights I’ve found.  One is that the prison staff can be loads more humane than military/FSB—and they think that might be because fear they’ll be mobilized.

However, some azov guys say prison staff were worse, bc made to “walk the gambit” multiple times, blindfolded.

One who ended up changing a his captors minds was a history professor from Mariupol—he was swept up and capture, well, he had stayed at Azovstal simply because he taught a military history class to the marines and had gone to see if need help, and ended up staying w them.  So the Russians didn’t let him go like the were supposed to for civilians.  He’d argue with him how Russian language in Mariupol, and *some* Russian history, does not mean it is a Russian city.  How can appreciate Russian literature or culture without that appreciation meaning that the city longs to be Russian.  He was thoroughly familiar with Russian writers—philosophers, political scientists—and the FSB kept bring in “higher-ups” to persuade him, bc they thought he was perfect for propaganda, because he *did* see value in Russian history, literature, culture, etc.  But he would just end up persuading them to his thinking instead, which said something valuable doesn’t equal superiority, that language doesn’t define nationality, that people who’ve identified as Ukrainian and want to be with the nation of Ukraine shouldn’t be forced to be Russian simply because *Russians* think it’s better for them, etc.  When he was released, he got a lot of press because in telling his story, he didn’t wholly condemn the Russians and the Ukrainians didn’t like that.  Oh, he was also able to coax them into providing him a library.  And then he’d debate various books.  The Russians would want him to read the propaganda books.  He refused unless also brought such-n-such books.  They would comply, bc they respected him, it seems. 

One young guy was paralyzed while at Azovstal, still take into in captivity, for like 6 months.  He says he got lucky, a DNR doctor was casually walking by, noticed he “talked weird,” came in and manipulated his face, told him he had a broken jaw and suspected it was fusing wrong and he’d never be able to get it right.  The doctor said he was an orthopedic surgeon, but they aren’t letting him perform such non-essential surgeries now, but that doctor was able to operate on this guy.  As it turned out, out of all his problems, that doctor did the best care bc everyone else just overlooked his needs.  He says he never got painkillers.  And stayed on his back basically the entire time. 

I’ve read so many brutal stories.  No mercy.  Chaplains.  Physicians.  Wounded.  The electrocutions.  The day-long mandatory stiff standing, dehydration, patriotic songs, the malnutrition. 

When they get out, they have heart problems, close to renal failure.  (I’ve also read the physicians from rehab interviews, I think I only posted one, though.)

043c155ba5cc328b5b19963ca0ed0254,11qwaef,jc5taom,"Yeah was going to say..what?

Leopard 1s are arguably a similar design philosophy to soviet tanks in that they prioritise mobility over armor. 

Using weight as a rough guide to armor ( which admittedly doesn't tell the whole story) they weigh between 40-43 tons about the same as a T 72 or a T 80 depending on their exact version number, and about 3-5 tons less than a T90. 

So really they only look under-armored compared to the modern western behemoths like the Leopard 2 (62 tons), Challenger 2 (64 tons) and Abrams M1A2 (73 tons!), all of which are just in a different class to any soviet tanks when it comes to survivability. 

And at that lower weight you're getting excellent range and mobility and given they are getting L1A5s advanced optics to go with the highly accurate, highly effective rifled 105mm gun,  If you look at examples where that gun has actually been used, for example during the Israel -Syria war, there's absolutely no doubt it will fuck a T72- unsurprisingly given thats exactly what it is designed to do.

You certainly wouldn't want to go toe to toe with a modern T90 in one, but until the Challenger 2s and Leopard 2A6s enter the chat,  Ukraine has a grand total of zero tanks that would be able to do that. 

 In terms of the tanks currently operating in numbers in Ukraine, Leopard 1A5s are not at all out of place, and in some ways I suspect 100+ somewhat older tanks capable of tangling with a T72, with the prospect of regular additional deliveries, are going to be of more value than, says 30 odd Leopard 2A6s if that is all that will be available period. The 2A6s may be way way more survivable and effective but they are also going to be much more challenging to use aggressively because Ukraine will not want to lose any under any circumstances.",1678778426.0,1678776538.0,t3_11qwaef,t1_jc5pzo3,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

US does not hold all the cards, and the US does not benefit from escalation at all - in fact, it is Russia that has the advantage on the balance of resolve, because Ukraine matters more to Russia than it does to the West.

Quoting Harvard professor of international relations Stephen M. Walt in [his recent piece for Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/15/putin-right-ukraine-war/):

>	Most important of all: Putin understood that Ukraine’s fate was more important to Russia than it was to the West. Please note: It is by no means more important to Russia than it is to Ukrainians, who are making enormous sacrifices to defend their country. But Putin has the advantage over Ukraine’s principal supporters when it comes to being willing to bear costs and run risks. He has an advantage not because Western leaders are weak, pusillanimous, or craven, but because the political alignment of a large country right next door to Russia was always bound to matter more to Moscow than it was going to matter to people farther away, and especially to individuals living in a wealthy and secure country on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

>	This situation also explains why Ukrainians—and their loudest supporters in the West—have gone to enormous lengths to link their country’s fate to lots of unrelated issues. If you listen to them, Russian control over Crimea or any portion of the Donbas would be a fatal blow to the “rules-based international order,” an invitation to China to seize Taiwan, a boon to autocrats everywhere, a catastrophic failure of democracy, and a sign that nuclear blackmail is easy and that Putin could use it to march his army all the way to the English Channel. Hard-liners in the West make arguments like this to make Ukraine’s fate appear as important to us as it is to Russia, but such scare tactics don’t stand up to even casual scrutiny. The future course of the 21st century is not going to be determined by whether Kyiv or Moscow ends up controlling the territories they are currently fighting over, but rather by which countries control key technologies, by climate change, and by political developments in many other places.

>	Recognizing this asymmetry also explains why nuclear threats have only limited utility and why fears of nuclear blackmail are misplaced. As Thomas Schelling wrote many years ago, because a nuclear exchange is such a fearsome prospect, bargaining under the shadow of nuclear weapons becomes a “competition in risk taking.” Nobody wants to use even one nuclear weapon, but the side that cares more about a particular issue will be willing to run greater risks, especially if vital interests are at stake. For this reason, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that Russia would use a nuclear weapon if it were about to suffer a catastrophic defeat, and this realization places limits on how far we should be willing to push it. Again, not because Western leaders are weak-willed or craven, but because they are sensible and prudent.

A [recent report by the RAND corporation](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html) underscores these points:

>	Since October 2021, when he first briefed President Joe Biden on Russia's plans to invade Ukraine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley reportedly kept a list of ""U.S. interests and strategic objectives"" in the crisis: ""No. 1"" was ""Don't have a kinetic conflict between the U.S. military and NATO with Russia."" The second, closely related, was ""contain war inside the geographical boundaries of Ukraine.""

This is and should always be the major overriding consideration in all of our actions, and it seems so far we are thankfully sticking to it, no matter how many people online are crying for blood.

The entirety of the report is well worth a read, suggesting that a long and protracted war in Ukraine is not in our interest at all, and that always first and foremost seeking to minimize the risk of escalation must always be our top priority.

Coupled with the Russians heat treating materials to the nth degree making the steel extremely hard but brittle. This is why you see so many destroyed t34s that look like they've been fragmented.

We know that Ukraine have had to deploy troops for counter artillery to defend this. We know that supply has been shelled, supply has had to be done at night at random times and with small groups. We know the condition of these roads (some just mud) are horrible and that the supply convoys have been hit. All of these things are less favorable and will mean that Ukraine isn't getting close to 5 to 1 ratios anymore. 

This is inevitable from the most casual viewing of a map. 

What we don't know is what function this defense has in terms of strategy, if any, because we don't know whether Ukraine are preparing to counterattack. Do they believe the Russians are overextended? I have no idea, but you can be concerned about bakhmut without being a concern troll or shill or bot. The situation there is exceedingly worrying to me.

Doubtless many tyrants whose aggressive attempts at world domination failed, trapped in the bunker like the famous recent Hitler raving scene, would order a nuclear strike, taking his enemies with him, as well as his countrymen who “failed him.”  Hitler would have sent out the order, if he had weapons like Putin does. . Maybe a German general would have thwarted it, like the general who did not burn Paris when ordered. Hirohito might not have given the order, but what about Tojo? One option is to give a tyrant in a bunker, holding the world as nuclear hostages, just like a bank robber with hostages, a theoretical escape and abdication plan. The bank hostage taker wants a helicopter, a guaranty he won’t be killed, a plane to a country which won’t extradite him, and money. Sounds like a nice package for a dictator, although defenestration or the Beria  treatment, or a Nuremberg trial would be more satisfying. 

I’m not sure that there’s a way to put the bunker guy with the nuke button into a war crimes trial, unless his underlings can be motivated to sack him.  Beria  was as ruthless a secret police boss as Putin, but was sacked in 1953, tried by a kangaroo court and shot.  Khruschev was sacked in 1964 and just forced into retirement, with an apartment, a dacha and a pension, living another 7 years. A study found that some autocrats from 1960 to 2004 allowed competitive elections which voted them out, in exchange for promises of no prosecution.

Here NATO might be kicking out Hungary for good reason.  Hungary could be said truthfully to be weakening NATO by preventing important states from joining.  And Hungary is regressing pretty far from the Western model of liberal democracy.

But the precedent is bad.  If NATO kicks out Hungary now, some states may wonder if a future member might be kicked out for less pure reasons.
