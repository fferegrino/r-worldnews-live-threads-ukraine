Day 49 of my updates from Kharkiv.

In the past couple of days shelling and missile attacks were pretty intense, worse than before. As usual they are continuing destroying eastern part of our city and to the lesser extent northern and western parts. Where I am it is still quite safe, but the sound of explosions is almost constant, sometimes there are barrages of explosions that last multiple minutes at a time, most likely from MLRSs. Yesterday something flew close to our building and it sounded either like a jet or a big missile, they produce by far the worst sounds.

Also today it looks like that attack on Russian convoy north from Kharkiv from couple of days ago, where allegedly Russian casualties were in hundreds was officially confirmed. They didn’t say the number of human casualties, but said that 40 vehicles were destroyed, which is great, it will probably jam the road they were traveling on.

Some more good news, just now Russian MOD confirmed that their cruiser “Moskva” was damaged, and everyone was evacuated from it. Of course they didn’t say it was hit with missiles, they said that its ammunition supply just blew up, and they are investigating what caused it.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier cancelled his plans to join the group after Ukraine made clear that he was not welcome, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz now invited instead.

""I was ready to do this, but apparently - and I have to take note of this - this was not wanted in Kyiv.""  
  
The German newspaper Bild cited Ukrainian sources as saying that Steinmeier was refused admission to Kyiv ""due to close ties with Russia in recent years"".

""MOSCOW, 13 April. /TASS/. Russia's economy will need at least two years to rebuild if sanctions remain at their current level, Alexei Kudrin, head of the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, told reporters.

“Of course, our economy will have to rebuild, it seems to me that we need to separate the medium and long term. If the sanctions remain at the same level they are now, then it will take about two years, no less. I would say that this is the first stage, and then we will have to restructure for many years, because we are talking about import substitution of a number of goods,"" he said.

Kudrin also expressed hope that no measures would be taken in the Russian Federation that would hinder the procedure for the return of foreign companies to the Russian market.

""I heard from the Prime Minister that yes, there will be an opportunity to return. I hope that no such measures will be taken that would make it difficult to return,"" he told reporters on Wednesday.

Earlier, Kudrin said that the decline in Russia's GDP by the end of 2022 would exceed 10%, and inflation could reach 20%.

Operational information as of the morning of April 13, 2022 regarding the Russian invasion

Со The forty-ninth era of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion has begun.

The full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine continues.

 🔹The enemy continues to launch missile and bomb strikes on civilian infrastructure in Kharkiv and Zaporizhia regions.  Actively conducts air reconnaissance.

 🔹Until April 26, the Russian Federation has introduced a so-called “yellow level of terrorist threat” in the areas bordering our country and in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea.  These measures are probably carried out in order to organize the movement of military equipment, weapons and personnel on the territory of Ukraine.

 🔹The occupiers continue to send so-called “volunteers” to Ukraine.  Thus, according to available information, a battalion of about 400 people was formed in the Leningrad region.  It consists exclusively of servicemen with combat experience.  They were sent to Ukraine to reinforce one of the units of the 42nd Motorized Rifle Division of the 58th All-Army.

 🔹In the Seversky direction, it is possible to maintain separate units in the border areas of Kursk region with Ukraine to conduct demonstration actions in order to restrain our forces.

 🔹Partial blockade and artillery shelling of the city of Kharkiv continues in the Slobozhansky direction.  In some temporarily occupied territories, the enemy resorted to forming units of the so-called ""people's militia.""  To implement these measures carries out appropriate work.

 🔹In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the enemy continued to launch air strikes on Mariupol.  He is launching an offensive near the Azovstal metallurgical complex and the seaport.
 
 🔹In the South Bug direction, the enemy is trying to capture some settlements, but without success.

 🔹In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, the defenders of Ukraine have repulsed six enemy attacks over the past 24 hours, destroyed two units of motor vehicles and three enemy artillery systems.

 🔹A group of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine shot down an enemy Su-25 aircraft the day before.  The enemy has significantly reduced the use of aircraft due to weather conditions.

* The Moscow was built in Mykolaiv, Ukraine in the 1970s.
* The Neptune anti-ship missiles was reportedly fired from Odesa, which is an incredibly awesome touch of irony.
* The Moscow displaced approximately 19,000 tonnes of water.
* If confirmed sunk or lost in combat, it would be the largest warship sinking since 1945 when the Japanese Battleship, the Hyūga, was sunk by American warplanes and bombers. The Hyūga displaced almost 30,000 tonnes of water.
* The Moscow was used as an anti-air defense for the Black Sea fleet and direct land area. 
* It remains to be seen if the lost of the Moscow will have any military impact on the ground-based fighting on the southern front, including Mariupol.
* However, this is a huge boost of morale for Ukraine, and a catastrophic loss of military power and men for Russia. 
* How Russia reacts is anyone's guess, but heads will definitely roll, and it is possible that the remaining warships in the Black Sea may be forced to back away and leave the shorelines undefended.

It's a lengthy article. To quote a small part: 

""The Bayraktar TB2 can also use its own weapon load of four MAM-L munitions against enemy ships or any other target that requires a precision strike. The 7km range of the MAM-L already exceeds that of the air defence systems on all but four of the Russian Navy's Black Sea fleet naval ships. The introduction of INS/GPS to the MAM-L has increased the range of the munition even further to upwards of 14km, although this is not enough outrange those remaining four ships.

 Besides being equipped with a number of proven systems such as the WESCAM MX-15D FLIR turret and MAM-series of munitions, the navy's TB2s feature a number of improvements over the examples acquired by the Ukrainian Air Force in 2019. Most notably, they have an increased communications range of up to 300km compared to 150km on the previous version. The associated ground control stations also appear to have undergone small modifications, and the new container-based systems enable greater mobility. The navy's TB2s will be used by the 10th Naval Aviation Brigade stationed at Mykolaiv-Kulbakino airbase that is jointly operated with the air force.

The wide-ranging report included an assessment on whether Finland should purse closer cooperation with NATO and considered the effects of a possible NATO membership.

If Finland and Sweden become full NATO members, the report said “the threshold for using military force in the Baltic Sea region would rise,” enhancing “the stability of the region in the long term.” 

Membership would include signing up to NATO’s founding principle of collective defense — commonly referred to as Article 5 — which means that an attack against one NATO ally is considered as an attack against all allies.

For Finland, the report outlined that “the most significant effect of its possible NATO membership would be that Finland would be part of NATO’s collective defence, and be covered by the security guarantees enshrined in Article 5.”

The deterrent effect of being a NATO member would be “considerably stronger than it is at present, as it would be based on the capabilities of the entire Alliance,” the report said, and “Finland would be prepared to support other NATO member countries in a possible Article 5 situation.”

1-2 days into the war, Russians were supportive of Putin (who doesn't like a quick easy war of 'liberation'?).

While some bland comments like 'Russia for victory' got significantly upvoted, specific nationalistic pro-Putin or anti-Ukraine comments got more downvotes than upvotes.

From CNN's Oren Liebermann and Barbara Starr 

The Pentagon is convening a meeting of its top weapons makers Wednesday to discuss the industry’s capacity to support Ukraine in a protracted war with Russia, according to a defense official and an industry official.

The meeting today at the Pentagon will be classified and chaired by Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks. The attendees will represent Boeing, L3Harris, Raytheon, BAE, Lockheed Martin, Huntington Ingalls, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, a US official tells CNN. 

The three main topics to be discussed are supplying Ukraine, re-supplying partners and allies as well as resupplying US inventories.

With regards to Ukraine, they will discuss more about immediate security needs of Ukraine but also look out two to four years at least.

The official says the assessment is even if the Russian troops somehow leave, there will still be enduring security concerns. They will also discuss that over time, some of what is being provided will be obsolete production and new versions will have to be supplied as replacements.

With regards to partners and allies, the participants will discuss what might be in production or going into production that is a reasonable backfill (especially the Patriot system).

There is NO quick-fix for this problem, other than to realize: Russia does not have very many of these advanced fighters, and Ukraine (or allies) need to either shoot these planes down with anti-air, or bomb them on the ground.

Eventually; Ukraine's going to need their own advanced planes, including trained pilots and support infrastructure. That's a very tall ask; and maybe not even technically possible within a 6-12 month time-frame. I don't think there are any western allies who have these advanced Russian fighters.

59b77cddb26a4fbcef8db8e394df4579,u2hmac,i4k5n3v,"For those of you who've been following this for the long haul and want some stuff to look into, there are a few things that I think give context to the war in general that people seem not to know about. 

First is Russia's attitude about WWII.  Russian politicians and media have been using their WWII victory as a speaking point and morality lesson way more than the US ever did.  They're not really calling Ukrainians Nazis because of any actual political ideology, it's just such a saturated word over there that it means almost nothing. (If you look into the linguistic stuff, they're using portmanteaus like ""ukranazis,"" and interestingly enough Ukraine has a similar institutional memory and are calling the Russians the ""raschists"" because, if anything, Ukraine had a worse time in WWII) Also, it's important to remember that they don't really forgive countries like Poland or Germany in the way that English speaking nations have. WWII in general is much more recent in the Russian psyche than you'd think, especially because they genuinely did lose an entire generation of men to that war and there are still consequences for that even now.  This is also why the internal conversation about conscripts being forced to fight is huge politically. 

Second, is Tzarist Russia. Russia was a strict monarchy until 1917, and has a national memory of that much more recent than most western democracies.  Sure, the UK and some European nations still do have royalty, but they've had democratic checks and balances at some level for a while, wheras Russia had direct unfettered monarchies well into the 20th century. And of course, for us Americans, we kicked that shit to the curb in the 1700s and really have no institutional memories of a monarchy. Russians also have never had a functional democracy, and the last time Russia had a coherent identity and national pride it was during the tzarist times.  This is why I personally feel like this is a tzarist imperialist genocide and war, instead of something comparable to the Nazis. Putin has a cult of personality, builds giant yachts and opulent palaces, and genuinely thinks that might makes right and he can do whatever he wants with the military strength he has. The messaging about the war is consistent with this too, they're treating Ukraine (and several other nations) as vassal states, they think they have rights over those states, and invade them ""for their own good"" and they'll send Russian federal troops in to other vassal states to squash rebellion and discontent.  If you view Putin's actions through a feudal/monarchy lens, all of his actions make perfect sense, and all of the rhetoric you see coming out of Russia makes perfect sense as well.  Erase your preconceived notions about Nazis, this is actually an older political philosophy.   And, historically, a more common one. 

Third, Russian feelings towards the military.  In the US and other western democracies, we've been pretty lucky in the sense that we've hit the constitutional and practical balance of civil oversight of the military *just* right and we've never had a major coup or even a mutiny in living memory.  Some of that is simply luck, with heroes like Smedley Butler and the leadership of the US military remaining professional during the Trump years.  However, literally every time there's been a lasting political change within Russia, it's been a military coup or rebellion. First the Russian soldiers of Petrograd mutinying in the 1917 January Revolution , and then the crew of the cruiser Aurora kicking off the assault on the Winter Palace in the October Revolution, and the 1993 Constitutional Crisis. Both Soviet leadership and current Russian Federation leadership fully understand this, and this is why Russian military leadership is intentionally kept out of the loop, barely functional, and stupid. Stalin, Khrushchev, and now Putin in particular have intentionally formed the military to be completely mindless drones with no self determination or decision making capabilities.

From CNN's Tim Lister, Maria Kostenko in Chernivtsi and Nathan Hodge in Lviv

Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych has has said that after a ""risky maneuver"" the last remaining defenders of the besieged port city of Mariupol have been able to join forces.

Arestovych said Wednesday that ""in Mariupol, as a result of a risky maneuver, units of the 36th Independent Marine Brigade broke through to [join] the Azov regiment.""

Both units have been involved in a last-ditch attempt to resist a Russian offensive against the city that has lasted well over a month.

""This is what happens when officers do not lose their heads, but firmly maintain command and control of the troops,"" Arestovych said.

CNN cannot independently confirm the details of the operation. Members of the Marine unit posted a video statement on Tuesday saying they would hold on ""until the end,"" despite being surrounded by Russian forces and running low on supplies.

On his Facebook account, Arestovych said that the Azov regiment had ""received substantial reinforcements ... the 36th brigade avoided defeat and received additional serious opportunities, in fact, gained a second chance.""

Arestovych claimed that ""the defenders of the city, now together, seriously strengthened their defense area.""

The defenders of the city, where some 100,000 civilians remain trapped amid widespread devastation, have been fighting to hold parts of the port and Azovstal, a giant steel factory that lies on Mariupol's eastern outskirts.

The Russian military claimed in a statement Wednesday that 1,026 Ukrainian Marines -- including 162 officers and 47 women servicemembers -- had surrendered in the vicinity of the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol, a claim that could not be verified.

Russia has focused an intense propaganda effort around the battle for Mariupol, claiming to have seized key positions in the city, even as Ukrainian forces have continued to hold out.

Some background: Independent analysis of the situation in Mariupol on Sunday published by the Institute for the Study of War assessed that the defense of Mariupol had reached a critical stage.

The report is 108 pages. Here are key snippets from the section titled General Observations and Executive Summary (Pages 2 & 3):

>	A detailed assessment of most allegations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) violations and the identification of war crimes concerning particular incidents has not been possible. Nevertheless, the mission found clear patterns of IHL violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities. If they had respected their IHL obligations in terms of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack and concerning specially protected objects such as hospitals, the number of civilians killed or injured would have remained much lower. Similarly, considerably fewer houses, hospitals, cultural properties, schools, multi-story residential buildings, water stations and electricity systems would have been damaged or destroyed. Furthermore, much of the conduct of Russian forces displayed in the parts of Ukraine it occupied before and after 24 February 2022, including through its proxies, the self-proclaimed “republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk, violates IHL of military occupation.

… 

>	The Mission has also considered the impact of the current conflict on human rights. While it has not been able to verify all the reported incidents that involve violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL), it has found credible evidence suggesting that such violations concerning even the most fundamental human rights (right to life, prohibition of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment) have been committed, mostly in the areas under the effective control of Russia or entities under overall control of Russia. The Mission has also concluded that the impact of the conflict on the enjoyment of human rights has gone beyond the direct violations of these rights. By causing a high level of destruction and by interfering with the provision of vital services (education, healthcare), the conflict started by the unlawful attack by Russia has made it very difficult for Ukraine to effectively respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of its inhabitants. Furthermore, the Mission has found that while the conflict has affected all the inhabitants of Ukraine, it has exerted and continues to exert particularly negative effects on individuals belonging to vulnerable groups, such as women, children, older persons or persons with disabilities.

>	The Mission is not able to conclude whether the Russian attack on Ukraine per se may qualify as a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population. It however holds that some patterns of violent acts violating IHRL, which have been repeatedly documented in the course of the conflict, such as targeted killing, enforced disappearance or abductions of civilians, including journalists and local officials, are likely to meet this qualification. Any single violent act of this type, committed as part of such an attack and with the knowledge of it, would then constitute a crime against humanity.

>	While some findings of this report are necessarily preliminary due to the short period of investigation in the context of an ongoing international armed conflict with a large number of events occurring every day that could constitute violations of international law or even international crimes, the report can inform other bodies’ more in-depth investigations into legal accountability. The findings may also contribute to establishing political accountability. With regard to violations of IHL and IHRL the responsibility lies with both the Russian Federation and Ukraine to observe their respective obligations. As this report shows, violations occurred on the Ukrainian as well as on the Russian side. The violations committed by the Russian Federation, however, are by far larger in nature and scale.

Article II

In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

a) Killing members of the group;

b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

*The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been called a historical turn – yes, certainly, but in what direction? Some call it a regression into the Cold War, some fear a “new 1914”, others speak of an ""unprecedented new environment"". These assessments are all wrong.*

*The Cold War remained “cold”: both sides respected the taboo of a transgression of the demarcation line. Today, however, we are witnessing a hot war and are concerned about it spreading into the territories of our Eastern NATO allies, and Putin’s nostalgia for the Soviet Empire is clear.*

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff, Serhiy Leshchenko, denied in an interview with CNN that Mr Zelensky had rejected a visit offer from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as reported by the Bild newspaper.

Mr Steinmeier said on Tuesday that he had planned to visit Kyiv with his Polish counterpart and the presidents of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia ""to send a strong signal of European solidarity with Ukraine... (but) that was not wanted in Kyiv"".

Bild reported that Mr Zelensky had rejected Mr Steinmeier's plans to visit due to his close relations with Russia in recent years and his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, a project designed to double the flow of Russian gas direct to Germany but which has since been cancelled.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/13/ukrainian-fighter-pilots-mig-29-russians/

Edit: Adding full article. 

ODESSA, Ukraine — The fighter pilot known as “Juice” usually just has a few minutes to scramble. When he is on-call, which is pretty much always these days, he cannot be more than a bathroom break away from his cockpit. When a cruise missile or a Russian fighter is spotted moving toward the area Juice is assigned to by the Ukrainian air force, he doesn’t even have time to run through standard safety checks before taking off.

“We’re ready to be killed,” said Juice, who provided only his call sign for security reasons.

“But we don’t want this, of course,” the 29-year-old added. “We want to kill Russians and take down their bombers that are killing our cities and our families.”

Juice is one of the pilots helping Ukraine pull off the biggest surprise of this war: Its military has kept the airspace over Ukraine contested despite Russia’s more advanced jets and superior numbers. But he and other pilots say that’s not enough. While Kyiv’s forces have perhaps even outperformed Moscow’s on the ground, Russia has continued to inflict heavy losses on Ukraine from the sky.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has appealed to the United States and other NATO allies to establish a no-fly zone over the country — a step that leaders in the military alliance refused to take, citing fears of touching off a world war with Moscow. Now Zelensky is pushing for more advanced air-defense systems and jets.

But Juice and others have said the weapons that countries have discussed transferring to Ukraine — particularly Russian-made MiG-29 fighters and U.S.-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles — won’t help Kyiv’s air force tip the scales in its favor. The gap between the weapons Ukraine wants and what Western countries are willing to supply has become a key tension nearly two months into the fighting.

Nowhere is that divide more evident than in the proposed air materiel transfers. Juice flies MiG-29s, which are a Soviet-era staple of the Ukrainian air force. But he said Ukrainian pilots are “just targets” for Russian adversaries who fly far more advanced jets. Obtaining more outdated MiGs would not improve Ukraine’s position in the skies, he said.

“We have losses almost everyday in our air force,” he added. “You won’t see this on TV because everything is classified right now, but actually we have a lot of losses. That’s why we need to be technically equal with the Russians. Just our mental advantage is not enough to fight with these technologies.”

Poland last month offered to send a number of MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via a U.S. air base in Germany, blindsiding U.S. officials. In exchange, Poland requested that the United States send it replacement planes, presumably newer U.S.-manufactured F-16s, which would constitute a major upgrade. Washington rejected the plan.

Then on Monday, Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger told reporters that Slovakia will consider providing Ukraine MiG-29 fighters if alternative protection of its own airspace can be arranged.

But for Ukrainian pilots, more MiG-29s aren’t the answer. The jets Poland offered to transfer them are even older — some date back to the late ’80s — than their current stock.

“I think the Ukrainians are right — you’re basically a target in the air if you don’t have any of that modern capability,” said Herbert “Hawk” Carlisle, a retired U.S. Air Force general. “It’s not just an airplane up there. You have to have all of that sophisticated equipment on it to make it really a viable air platform.”

Countries have proposed sending Ukrainians MiG-29s in large part because that’s what the country’s pilots already know how to fly. If they received F-16s, Carlisle said, it’s not just the pilots who would have to learn a flight system he described as “significantly different” from Soviet-style jets; personnel on the ground would have to train on how maintain the aircraft and load them with compatible munitions.

But Juice and another Ukrainian pilot, whose call sign is “Nomad,” said the learning curve isn’t as substantial as it’s often made out to be. Nomad, who is in the United States as part of a training program, said it would probably take Ukrainians about two weeks to learn the nuances of the U.S.-made F-series planes. 

Many of the pilots already speak English and have participated in joint exercises with the U.S. Air Force, so they’re familiar with the terminology of those planes’ systems, they said.

The pilots were also critical of the effectiveness of Stinger antiaircraft missiles, which have been part of U.S. aid packages. Nomad said that “it’s almost impossible” to hit an agile, fast-moving Russian jet with the missiles. Carlisle agreed, adding that Stingers aren’t designed to take down fighters — they’re intended to be used against helicopters and other slow-moving, low-flying aircraft.

If Western countries are hesitant to give Ukraine modern jets its pilots haven’t trained on, Juice said they should at least consider sending more advanced air-defense systems. He said those are much easier to learn how to operate.

Military analysts expected Russia to wipe out Ukraine’s air-defense systems, airfields and aircraft on the very first day of the war, when Moscow still had the element of surprise. But Rob Lee, an expert on the Russian military and a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said Russia “didn’t really go for a death blow,” and in some cases, their missiles hit the airfield but missed the runway.

Ukrainian pilots were able to improvise from there. Juice said the fight in the sky doesn’t feel fair when he’s going up against a more modern Russian jet. He often has to just avoid his adversary entirely to stay alive. Sometimes he and his fellow pilots manage to trick the Russians into flying into an area where the Ukrainians have an air-defense system ready and waiting.

Analysts at the Oryx Blog, which tracks Russian military losses, documented 20 aircraft and 30 helicopters destroyed or damaged in Ukraine.

“We are just trying to do something nonstandard, and sometimes it’s successful and sometimes it’s not,” Juice said. “Sometimes they’re just stupid and Russians are just showing their incompetence and underestimating our training.

“But in general, we cannot gain a real air superiority, unfortunately.”",1649861722.0,1649860048.0,t3_u2hmac,t3_u2hmac,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Russia may be planning a ""Victory Day parade"" in the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the city's mayor, has said on Telegram.

He said Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, whom Russian troops put in charge of the parts of Mariupol under their control, was ordered ""to clear a part of the city's central district of rubble and dead bodies to ensure that a parade can be held on 9 May"".

""Judging from the whole array of data, the occupiers are planning to hold a 'victory carnival' in Mariupol in case their 'special operation' is successful,"" Andryushchenko has said.

He added: ""The good news is that there are no vehicles or people in the city to carry out such events.""

The parade would coincide with Russia's biggest public holiday, Victory Day, which is held annually on 9 May to celebrate triumph over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.

A number of military deployments were observed along a major highway and the corridor that leads from the towns of Soloti and Valuyki in western Russia's Belgorod region, toward the Ukraine border.

The deployments consist of dozens of armored vehicles, troops with tents and support equipment, the images appear to show. They can be seen in the satellite images in fields and farms west of Soloti and near the Russian towns of Dubrovka, Biriuch and Leonovka, which is about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the Ukraine border. 


Across the border in eastern Ukraine, several convoys of military equipment were seen along a highway near Vilkhuvatka. Additional military convoys were also seen on Monday in and near the Donbas region near the Ukrainian towns of Bilokurakyne and Kyslikva, according to Maxar.

Together, the convoys contain more than 200 vehicles and include tanks, armored personnel carriers, towed artillery and support equipment, Maxar said.

Ukraine doesn’t need migs so it can engage in direct peer-to-peer engagement with more advanced Russian fighters. That’s *absurd*, and I don’t know of a single person who insists that this is what they need. 

Russian jets are being relatively hampered by AA, and by all indications will be further constrained when Ukraine gets more and better AA, and gets those installations to where they need to be.

Ukraine needs to migs to support ground operations and maintain forward momentum. This affects *everything* on the battlefield. Quite literally everything. The ability to soften lines almost instantaneously and maintain effective penetration, hold gains, suppress reinforcements, take out hard targets, create opportunities for ground forces—everything. All of the things Ukraine needs to actually win this war and mitigate losses are significantly buttressed by power in the skies.

Migs really aren’t ideal for this work, but they are literally a hundred times better than not having them at all. 

It is very helpful when pilots are properly up-to-date about the campaigns they are taking part in, but it is not an absolute necessity for them to be effective in conducting sorties and carrying out the work that is tasked to them, and these pilots very *clearly* are not informed about why they are important and how their work is needed for others to do what needs to be done.

These fighters *cannot* be properly utilized without having enough of them to maintain a dominating presence, without a consistent sortie ratio they become more vulnerable as time goes on, but if they are maintained and consistent then they become *less* vulnerable with time, and efficacy exponentially improves.

People are doing everything they can to excuse away not giving more fixed wing craft to Ukraine, as if the very notion somehow makes them *less* effective, which is absolutely preposterous. Give them more jets and find out. Seriously, fucking do it. Find out directly. If it doesn’t help, then so what, Ukraine now has more jets.

If this is the argument they want to make about not giving Ukraine migs, then start training with the Falcons now so they can be ready when Russia has finished redeploying.",False,1649888167.0,t3_u2hmac,t3_u2hmac,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

I'm hoping that some of you can educate me here.

Earlier, we saw that propaganda video that Rusia put out of one of their ships engaging with a TB2 (and failing).

In that video, we see a couple of missiles being fired.

I know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about war and war costs.

Outside of war/in a vacuum sort of situation, what is like a super average ballpark figure to pay for a missile? I guess it's totally dependant on the missile, but like yeah - one of those missiles launched by a ship. To the nearest power of 10. Just for 1 missile.

$10, $100, $1,000, $10,000, $100,000, $1,000 000?

Since the March 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, Crimea is under dispute by Russia and Ukraine. In an August 2016 interview with Radio Svoboda, Medvedchuk stated the from legal point of view, Crimea was part of Ukraine, ""but de facto, unfortunately, it belongs to Russia"". In the same interview, Medvedchuk accused the Ukrainian authorities of ""pushing the peninsula away, pushing its inhabitants away"" which allegedly prompted them to agree to the annexation.

It's still strange because I don't see any rationale for suggesting a fractured Russian force will produce any semblance of a victory when they initially threw their better supplied, (at the time) more morale-invigorated troops at the beginning of this whole mess, and that blew up spectacularly in their faces.

I also really wonder if Putin is allowing Dvornikov to make these decisions on his own, or if he's insisting what he believes to be the better strategy to use.

2. Demilitarize Ukraine - according to the Russian MOD, they have destroyed 99% of Ukraine's army already.
3. Ukraine doesn't join NATO - Ukraine has softly agreed to this, but will probably come up with a different defense treaty.

Putin can pull out today and stand in a stadium with a giant ""Z Campaign Accomplished"" banner.

The fact that he hasn't means that there's something else he's trying to accomplish, but there's a grab bag of potentials:

1. He's (Putin's regime) is trying to actually take over Donbas and set up the ""Donbas Republic"" like South Ossetia in Georgia and without that, the campaign cannot be declared successful in his mind.
   1. This was one of the points Putin wanted, but obviously without a military victory in the region, this is not going to happen. This is the single point he would have to massage more than others if he gets out.
2. He's trying to take and hold the oil/gas reserves along the coast of the Black Sea to prevent Ukraine from becoming competition. This means permanent military presence in the Donbas region or destruction of those reserves (if that's possible).
3. He's trying to take a larger portion of the WW grain pie and ruining Ukraine fields will cause a shortage that Russia will fill. Arguably, this has been somewhat achieved with the mass mining of fields.
4. He's trying to proclaim that Eastern Europe is Russia's playground and without total victory in Ukraine, this is impossible to do. Arguably, this is impossible at present due to Russian military failures so if he's going for this, then without total victory, he's done.

The infantry exists to protect and find targets for the artillery to destroy.

In contrast, US doctrine is that infantry is the primary force, and artillery (and air power) exists to support the infantry.

1. Infantry moves up, finds a target, confirms position.

2. Infantry disengages, Artillery saturates target area

3. Infantry moves up.

A (doctrinal) US advance is:

1. Infantry moves up, finds targets, engages.

2. Infantry directs supporting fire to appropriate targets.

3. Infantry clears area

4. Infantry moves up.

You can see this down to the equipment they development. Russian infantry are equipped with unarmed drones to serve as artillery spotters.

Gorbachev continued that “The agreement on a final settlement with Germany said that no new military structures would be created in the eastern part of the country; no additional troops would be deployed; no weapons of mass destruction would be placed there. It has been obeyed all these years.” To be sure, the former Soviet president criticized NATO enlargement and called it a violation of the spirit of the assurances given Moscow in 1990, but he made clear there was no promise regarding broader enlargement.

So it seems to me like advancing weaponry into GDR territory was the issue discussed and promises were made over.  

That said I do think part of the problem is that they thought this implied no further expansion of NATO east of old West Germany, and there’s no doubt this has happened, and it’s likely why Gorbachev complained in the 90s and Putin complains now.  I have no doubt in my mind that their interpretation was the GDR “line” meant to apply to NATO expansion in general anywhere east of that longitude.  They may have not specifically spelled it out because they couldn’t imagine Warsaw Pact nations joining NATO and/or they assumed not wanting troops in GDR territory implied the rest of Eastern Europe too.  This is the whole spirit of the law vs letter of the law debate.

As we saw around Kyiv, Sumy and Chernihiv; the Russian presence was itself very attritional and Russia hardly withdrew for any other reason other that remaining in position was destroying the operational strength of these formations.

This is what is happening in the East and South at the moment. Russia only has so many reserves that she can throw into a new offensive. Once these scary convoys are mauled enough and Russia has been bled enough that we'll actually see large scale Ukrainian counterattacks.

Like the withdrawal from Kyiv, strong formations can be whittled down by effective ambushing, drones and skirmishing until they simply just can't hold any more. Ukraine seems to be very effective at bleeding the Russians and as we saw in Kyiv, digging in didn't seem to stem the attrition. If anything, the Kyiv front entrenching themselves probably was the precursor to their decision to run away because switching over to the defensive against Ukraine was a losing strategy in the long run.

I don't think digging in around Donbas and Kerson will change this. If anything, once Russia has spaffed her reserves; I feel they might declare victory and run away again as the generals realise that digging in against an enemy that has the full tap of the Western industrial complex is not a winning battle of attrition.",1649844533.0,1649844036.0,t3_u2hmac,t1_i4jktgs,,1,18,0,18,0,0,

Alternatively, better AA systems for Ukraine would severely hamper the Russian Air Force, especially considering their maintenance issues that sanctions are causing.

Maybe they don’t want to do anything that could be considered provocation, even misconstrued as provocative by RU propaganda.  Maybe they lack (or simply perceive it as such) the logistical capabilities to sustain a large offensive.  Maybe they view the war as one of attrition, and are simply attempting to wait RU out while maintaining the defender’s advantage, and view large counter-offensives as risky gambits that are an unnecessary risk.

We Americans are no better.

Yes, we MUST do better. But we can't, as long as our corporate newsmedia continues to enable (and often encourage) genocide around the globe.

A very simple example, is Georges Ruggiu.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Ruggiu

These people work at media networks which amplify and spread their messages of hate and mass murder. They're backed by advertisers and shareholders.  And nobody does jack shit to stop them.

People in US Air Force usually dismiss this idea.  They are likely better informed.  It is a different idea of design goal, not necessarily a better idea.  I feel like it is also believable that people in tactical air command were hyper focussed on air to air and on trucking bombs.  Designers at Lockheed even more so.  Especially prior to the 91 gulf war.  Mig29's designers and pilots were integrated in the Soviet air defense forces.

https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2022-04/ukraine-russian-massacre-bucha-un-guterres-probe.html  (Reuters)  
  
>Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Ukraine's version of what happened in the town of Bucha was a ""fake attack"" aimed at undermining Moscow, the state-owned TASS news agency reported. Lavrov said the dead bodies were ""staged"" and that images of them and what he said was Ukraine's false version of events had been spread on social media by Western countries and Ukraine. During talks with UN Under-Secretary-General Martin Griffiths Lavrov said that the Ukrainian claim of a massacre of civilians in Bucha as “a provocation that posed a direct threat to global peace and security.” Russia's top diplomat also called on Britain, which holds the presidency of the UN Security Council for April, to fulfil its responsibilities in that role after it rejected a Russian request to convene a meeting over Bucha.  
   
Basically Lavrov said it was all fake and tried to convene a meeting about how fake it was, and Britain told Russia to get stuffed. The UN is investigating Bucha, they're just not giving Russia another opportunity to gaslight

 >The Battle of Drøbak Sound took place in Drøbak Sound, the northernmost part of the outer Oslofjord in southern Norway, on 9 April 1940. It marked the end of the ""Phoney War"" and the beginning of World War II in Western Europe. A German fleet led by the cruiser Blücher was dispatched up the Oslofjord to begin the German invasion of Norway, with the objective of seizing the Norwegian capital of Oslo and capturing King Haakon VII and his government. The fleet was engaged in the fjord by Oscarsborg Fortress, an aging coastal installation near Drøbak, that had been relegated to training coastal artillery servicemen, leading the Germans to disregard its defensive value.

* Moskva was reported hit by 2 missiles - these are normally good for letting air in the top, but not water in the bottom. The latter is what sinks ships.
* However, the weather is bad and stormy, possibly letting water in after all
* Ukraine Pravda mentioned Moskva was ""tactical flooding"" - probably a translation of ""counter flooding"", wherein a ship floods some compartments to keep it balanced if it is flooding only on one side.
* Another tweet says it has disappeared from RADAR

Conclusion:

* Moskva took one or more hits above the waterline, but is taking on water from the weather and is at risk of capsizing (rolling over) or already has.

U-864 heard the torpedoes coming and also dived deeper and turned away. She managed to evade the first three but steered into the path of the fourth and imploded, split in two and sank with all hands, coming to rest in over 150 m (490 ft) of water, 2 nmi (3.7 km; 2.3 mi) West of Fedje.""

*No one can know the future. What is conceivable today are three different scenarios*   
  
***1. Ukraine loses.***   
*Russia occupies the country and installs a puppet regime. Ukrainian resistance, however, does not stop, the occupants never gain complete control, and the resistance sweeps over into Belarus (already today, some Belarussians are participating in the Ukrainian defense effort). NATO improves its defense posture in the East quickly. Sanctions remain, and Europe, step by step, decouples its energy system from Russian oil, gas and coal. This looks like the early Cold War; the return to détente and cooperative security fails on the unchanged goals of Putin and the lacking trust of the West in the good  will of  Moscow.*   
  
***2. Ukrainian resistance proves insurmountable.***   
*Russia remains stalemated. Military losses rise further, sanctions take their toll, and Putin’s popularity experiences a drop. The Russian leadership is finally ready for a compromise: Ukraine becomes neutral,  combining the Swedish and Austrian models: it retains a formidable military and defense industry, stays out of NATO, but opens the accession path to the EU. Like for Austria, the US and Russia provide guarantees for Ukrainian independence, sovereignty and  territorial integrity. Russia retains Crimea, for Luhansk and Donetsk, referenda under international supervision are prepared. NATO strengthens its positions in the Baltic states and the Black Sea states, but probably at a lower level than in Scenario 1. Sanctions will be lightened, but probably not completely removed as long as Putin continues to lead  Russia.*  
  
***3. Ukrainian resistance becomes stronger.***   
*Russian  forces experience intolerable losses and are driven back toward the Russian border. Putin misses the chance for an early deal, and dissatisfaction within the military, intelligence services and oligarchs shoots up. Repression  is  no  longer  able  to  keep  protesters down. Putin is replaced by a leader holding more moderate objectives. Russia withdraws from Ukraine. The West urges Kyiv to agree to a compromise similar to scenario 2, but without the obligation of neutrality. Ukraine joins the EU and NATO or concludes a bilateral defense agreement with the Western Alliance. There are attempts to resume arms control and disarmament negotiations in Europe to achieve security at lower levels. Sanctions are gradually lifted. The resurrection of cooperative security is not guaranteed but appears possible.*",False,1649857661.0,t3_u2hmac,t1_i4kbq35,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

Seoul, Korea is in range, and within 6 hours, NK could (if they were attacked), slaughter millions of Koreans.

Interpretations of Napoleon’s death certificate estimate that his height when he died was between 5’2” and 5’7” (1.58 and 1.7 meters).

Sources consequently estimate that Napoleon was probably closer to 5’6” or 5’7” (1.68 or 1.7 meters) than to 5’2”.

Russian flagship cruiser 'hit by Ukrainian rockets'  
The Moskva involved in training in the Black Sea before the invasion  
EPACopyright: EPA  
The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea FleetImage caption: The Moskva is the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet  
A Russian cruiser which was famously defied by Ukrainian troops on a small island at the start of the war has been hit by Ukrainian rockets in the Black Sea, according to Ukrainian officials.  
  
The Moskva, the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, received ""very serious damage"", Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said.

The thing is, economic dependencies can sometimes go both ways.

No.  Nuclear power can be done quite safely. Just not at a profit, and not by a privately-owned company (probably only really applies to operation and maintenance; not design and construction). 

The simple problem is: (unmanaged) Capitalism.

It's true that problems like Chornobyl as we have all seen: the area around the accident can be made relatively ""safe""; but it very easily becomes deadly - even 30 years after the accident. 

The same is true for Fukushima.

The same is true for the Three Mile Island accident; which was mostly contained.

Pro-nuclear folks like to cite: ""oh, but only 5 people died"" etc. ""Safer than coal"" - which ignores that large increases in thyroid cancers and other problems, leukemia, and etc. which can't be legally attributed as ""caused by the accident"" - but these problems occur, nonetheless; and do shareholders pay for their treatment (or even their funerals)? Fuck no they don't. The victims pay. 

You know what has zero deaths?

1. Hunker down and take cover -- Aka: they're no longer firing at you.

2. Stand up and run away -- Aka: they're now easy targets to snipe.

Artillery doesn't need to hit the target to cause the psychological damage / change enemy tactics. Just having artillery hit somewhere in the area (even 50+ meters off target) is psychologically intimidating, and sufficient at screwing with the enemy's minds.

Yeah this is a small factor

>A physical ""buffer"" between Russia and the rest of Europe. The Donbas is an extremely vulnerable border, it being really flat and a few dozen kilometers from Moscow's arterial river.

This is the main factor. Russia wants a large buffer between its heartland and the west and also wants a shorter easier to defend border on the capathian mountains

 >An anti-tank grenade is a specialized grenade used to defeat armored targets. Although their inherently short range limits the usefulness of grenades, troops can lie in ambush or maneuver under cover to exploit the limited outward visibility of the crew in a target vehicle. Grenades were first used against armored vehicles during World War I, but it wasn't until World War II when more effective shaped charge anti-tank grenades were produced. AT grenades are unable to penetrate the armor of modern tanks, but may still damage lighter vehicles.

Not that anything the Russians have done so far has, but even if they hold their current area in the Donbas up until the 9th, the Ukrainians are on a warpath to remove Russians from the country, and they've outclassed the Russians in nearly every encounter they've had so far, and that's with very hastily thrown together logistics from NATO and the West.

I think Russia realized that as they were trying to patchwork together their remaining forces and equipment for a bigger battle in the East, that would give more time for NATO and the west to further equip the Ukrainians to rain death on them. But even still, the Russian units being put together now have no unit cohesion, non-existent morale, a laughable re-supply, and an incredibly motivated and increasingly better equipped enemy in the Ukrainians. 

As many have pointed out in relation to this strategy, you can 'zerg' an enemy if you have overwhelming numbers and an ability to constantly facilitate resupply and reinforcement. The Russians simply do not, and that's RIGHT on their fucking doorstep. To attempt this slow bleed tactic is going to allow the Ukrainians to slowly mangle their numbers down to a more manageable force for them to then to (hopefully) make their own larger push on the Donbas, thereby breaking off the Southeastern territories the Russians are attempting to hold. If they do that, they can cut off completely the broken resupply they have now (provided Turkey continues to prohibit any new supplies coming in via the Black Sea), starve off Crimea and the coast, and re-secure the entirety of contested areas of the country.

I don't think the Russians have any good strategic decisions they can make, outside of continually shelling from Russian territory, but as has been stated time and time again, that you cannot HOLD territory that way.

They're in a shitty situation of their own making, and I really don't see how they aim to hold territory this way, and if that goat fucking lunatic Kadyrov was speaking anything resembling the truth, there's absolutely no way they can continue this strategy towards making another attempt at Kyiv again.",False,1649873265.0,t3_u2hmac,t1_i4leenh,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

In very broad strokes, fascism, from ""fascio"" meaning bundle of sticks (and was also used as a more general term for a group of people)  is WWII era Italian-brand socialist trade-unionism championed by Benito Musolini, though its roots predate that to around WWI (to be fair, it morphed into a national socializm, similar but very distinct from WWII Germany's).  It became a much more vague term when the marxist Soviets used it to apply to Germany's national socializm (the infamous nazi party), to differentiate them.   Now, fascist sort of means anything related to the nazi German party or even more vaguely an authoritarian style government, or even pretty much anything that is sternly telling you to do something you don't like.

cd17280c61f6c72ec4f5ae57b586fd78,u2hmac,i4l3u6n,"> Putin will not dare to shoot first.

The problem is, ""shoot first"" and ""what your enemy will definitely consider an attack"" can both become muddied.

Say that NATO hands over planes, and spends days in Poland refitting, handing them over to Ukrainian pilots, etc.  And then there's a few more planes waiting to be handed over to the Ukrainians in Poland.  Maybe even Ukraine sends some planes back to Poland for maintenance.

Then there's a significant attack on Russian positions or Russia itself.  The temptation to hit the airfields where these planes are ""based"" gets really high, and to rationalize it as ""they're a legitimate target and Poland is attacking us with these planes, only with extra steps!""

It can happen suddenly like that, or it can happen in many small confused steps where each side thinks they are making a small, token, and necessary response to something that *cannot* be ignored by their side and that the other side will definitely let go.  Poles and Belarusians fucking with each other over the border with nonlethal rounds can become someone thinking it's real--- or just undisciplined troops losing their patience-- and chucking a grenade over.  And then the other side *has* to respond somehow, so...

It makes sense to do all of these things carefully, and to clearly communicate to the other side about intentions and what *we* would consider an escalation, to try and forestall this from happening.",False,1649868501.0,t3_u2hmac,t1_i4l07vx,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

However, MV Millennial Spirit was hit the day after the war started and has been burning ever since (as of article writing, 20 days later), which was almost 2 weeks before the purported attack on the Vasily Bykov.

 >The free surface effect is a mechanism which can cause a watercraft to become unstable and capsize. It refers to the tendency of liquids — and of unbound aggregates of small solid objects, like seeds, gravel, or crushed ore, whose behavior approximates that of liquids — to move in response to changes in the attitude of a craft's cargo holds, decks, or liquid tanks in reaction to operator-induced motions (or sea states caused by waves and wind acting upon the craft). When referring to the free surface effect, the condition of a tank that is not full is described as a ""slack tank"", while a full tank is ""pressed up"".

I'm talking about places like ""South Ossetia"" or ""Transnistria"", or independent ""Donesk"" and ""Luhansk"" - contrived nationalities who don't really need to have an independent identity or governance.  But where do we then draw the line? Because Russia uses the same exact argument against the existence of Ukraine. Ukraine makes a very convincing argument for self-governance (and it's nothing to do with language, or ethnicity, or culture, because Ukraine is fairly ethnically diverse, even if the majority group wants to enforce the Ukrainian language as ""official"" - the need for self-governance is to eliminate corrupt or criminal foreign influence against the interests of the Ukrainian people; ie. Yanukovych skipped out with billions of dollars from the Ukrainian treasury - impoverishing the entire nation). 

After WWII; the world agreed that we need to stop this bullshit artificial border-drawing that leads to war and genocide.  Then in 1947, the UN went ahead and made an ""ethnic enclave"" called Israel. A Jewish ethnostate. (as some now conceive it). Arguably causing a genocide of the Palestinian people.

 >An exchange of rubber for optical glass was proposed by Britain and Germany during the First World War. Optical glass was vital to the warfare of this era for binoculars and gunsights and rubber was needed for tyres and communications cables. Britain had sourced the majority of its pre-war optical glass from the German company of Carl Zeiss AG and by early 1915 was suffering from a shortage. Germany, with its sea trade blockaded by allied forces, was unable to import natural rubber and found it could not create enough high-quality synthetic rubber to replace it.

I will use your source to mark the reason why Ukraine wasn't invited to join NATO:
--New members must uphold democracy, including tolerating diversity.

--New members must be making progress toward a market economy.

--Their military forces must be under firm civilian control.

""The key determinant for any invitation to new members is whether their admission to NATO will strengthen the alliance and further the basic objective of NATO enlargement, which is to increase security and stability across Europe.""

Part of that is simple... In war; be reliably unpredictable. If Russia were any degree of competence, then it's pretty obvious what Ukraine would do again, given its success. So the next phase would want to look like the same but then quickly evolve into something else with a little bit of shock.

A good example of the shock would be quickly screwing up armoured columns in the first few weeks.

Another good example of shock is the strikes on Belgorod.

So maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but I'm watching Izium, Kherson and the route south to Melitopol as indicators of a possible Ukrainian advance. If I had to put money on it - Izium is the most immediately tactically important.",False,1649834553.0,t3_u2hmac,t1_i4jc9rp,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

If it's the Azov commander, they aren't even officially part of the Ukrainian military, I'm not sure how relevant their thoughts are.

If it's the marines' commander, then fair enough, though I'm not sure it's really a fair characterization. It's easy to get caught up with the heroism talk in the heat of battle but I'm not sure what he expected some of these soldiers to achieve beyond what they already did. They already spent 6-7 weeks under siege fighting until they ran out of ammo.

Wasn't it clear from satellite images that the Ukrainian forces were split up into multiple pockets at this point? It seems reasonable to suggest that some of them were in a better position to reach the Azov battalion whereas others were completely surrounded and had no realistic way of getting there.

Extending that to surrendering at gun point is a leap. You didn't wilfully place yourself into being at gun point, the enemy did. If we go down this route, you're essentially obligated to be killed. 

I'd argue pointlessly dying is deserting your obligation to fight. Death isn't a necessity to fulfill that obligation. You're more valuable living to fight another day, or attempting to sabatoge your captors.

You do bring up a good point. I don't think Shoigu, Gerasimov, or any soldier following orders would normally disagree with Putin.

Imperialism and regional security are not mutually exclusive concepts either. Imperialism isn't just expansion for the sake of expansion, it's driven by many factors but geographic security has been a huge factor historically for imperialism throughout history, particularly for Russia. Ever since they beat off the Mongols, the Russian civilization has strived for geographic security - the Caucuses in the south, the Pacific in the east, the arctic in the north - for much of its history the Russian Empires weak point has been the West. At its peak during the USSR, it largely achieved its best-case-scenario of controlling all the land up to the Carpathians, only needing to be concerned with the gap between those mountains and the Baltic sea.

While modern warfare has rendered many concerns with geography obsolete, they are still an important consideration - see Iran, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, etc. You may not like it, and it may not seem relevant to us little guys on the ground, but nations are always considering geography in their security arrangements. Russia is no different - in principle. How much this is the main motive behind a nation's actions varies from leader to leader. It's reductionist to consider Russia and the USSR as being exactly one in the same for the last 80 years.

However, getting back to the main point, as I've said several times (which you don't seem to be paying attention to) Putin is clearly not acting with regional security in mind, but some delusion of past glory and legacy building.
