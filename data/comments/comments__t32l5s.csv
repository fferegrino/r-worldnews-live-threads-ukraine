Putin, like Trump, is a symptom. There’s a significant population mass that choose stability and security in their simple lives over truth and free thinking. Putin will be gone one way or another - but these people will stay and will want another one.

All listed are deemed as ‘western’ and, therefore, ‘alien’ values to that slice of the population who respect strong power, God and minding their own business.

I want to provide another piece of insight into Russian culture that foreigners might not know about. All below is my personal opinion about my culture - I am hoping other Russians could jump in to comment what they think and how they relate.

There’s a certain trap narrative that gets exploited time and again in Putin’s speeches. This helps illustrate why a lot of people are silent right now.

This narrative is cultural and is deeply tied with orthodox Christianity (major religious denomination in Russia). I’ll try to bullet point it and then expand:

- Russia has its own, special way in the world history
- Russia has suffered a lot but always came out victorious - with the help of God and/or by devotion of its people
- Concept of ‘mysterious Russian soul’ (literal translation of a widely used phrase in Russia when talking about us) - something intangible about us that no outsider will ever understand
- Suffering as an acceptable Christian way of living, God’s ways are not always meant to be understood and are never meant to be questioned

Now think about the combination of both ‘suffering for the greater good as a lifestyle’ and historic antagonism ‘Russia vs the entire evil world’.

Putin, the country’s leader, spends years building and maintaining the return-to-cold-war narrative about evil West trying everything to destabilise and destroy Russia. Putin is fighting this fight alone on the world arena, having been successful so far in sticking to diplomacy.
Now, a sudden twist - Russian population is under genocide in Donbas. We must give our all to liberate them. If it means suffering, it’s automatically accepted as a tenet of Christianity and how we lived life so far. Sanctions? Isolation? It’s okay, as long as Russia and its people hold their victim values close to chest.

Now imagine someone trying to get out of this mindset. It automatically means giving up and challenging the values they lived for before. This, in its turn, might mean that you’re rejecting suffering in favour of personal responsibility for your life and taking control over what God used to have control over - and thus potentially giving up your place in heaven.

For deeply religious, Christian Russians - this is a foundation. A big slice of population - NOT religious but are in the similar trap - is involved in the government sector (so called ‘budgeteers’, people being paid out of the government budget). Those are simply scared to lose their meagre salary because it’s hard to find another job so they have to nod along with government narrative.

And this Venn diagram of the above two gets quite an overlap. This is generalised Russian ‘silent majority’. Not in Moscow, not in Saint-Petersburg - but in areas not exposed to foreign culture/language.

I’d love to write an optimistic conclusion about having a way out of it - but it will inevitably involve re-coding our culture away from ‘suffering for greater good’. And I don’t know how surmountable that is, if at all.",False,1646013550.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,148,0,148,0,0,

1. Russia needs to secure the large population centers and the seat of government to install a compliant gov. Can't do that if they're radioactive ash. So using a tactical nuke makes no sense there. If Russia wanted to destroy those cities they wouldn't need a nuke anyways because conventional artillery alone would be sufficient.

  
2. Tactical nuclear weapons are only really useful in cases where the unit you're trying to destroy is too well protected or entrenched to destroy with conventional weapons. The idea is if you have a massive enemy tank column you can't stop, throw a nuke at it as a last ditch effort. As far as we can tell Ukrainian forces are distributed across the country to avoid being destroyed by Russian air support, so a nuke would do what? Kill a few units? They're better off using artillery or at worst thermobaric weapons to soften the positions without all the complications a nuke causes for minimal gains.

  
3. Goes without saying but nukes are not subtle. A nuclear detonation is going to be clear as shit. Russia is trying desperately to control the narrative around this war to their own population because many of them view Ukraine as a brother nation. Their own messaging is about Ukraine being ""liberated"" from Nazis. If you use nuke, even with all of Russia's information controls that shit is going to get out, and it is not going to go well with the populous or within the government. I highly doubt you'd even find a Russian commander willing to use a nuke on Ukrainians.

  
4. Russian forces and Ukrainians forces are in close contact with one another. Nukes (even smaller ones) are big, nasty and indiscriminate. It's a bad idea to shell areas close to your own troops. Nuking them would be a level of tactical malpractice unmatched in human history.  
5. A tactical nuke sends one message as well, ""we are fucking desperate and we are out of ideas"". If the Ukrainians are nuked it sends them one message, ""we are kicking their ass so hard they had to go somewhere they have never gone"". It would galvanize them in a manner unseen, and that not even taking into account ""fuck these guys the nuked us!""

Not to say that errors can't be made but the decision to attack with a nuclear weapon is one with a bunch of stakeholders, including the military who are the ones who actually have to relay the order. Putin may have made a reckless error (but to be honest not a obvious one) in invading Ukraine but the use of nuclear weapons (versus saber rattling) is not a casual decision.",False,1646012954.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,62,0,62,0,0,

Let's be clear about we're doing: there *is* a war of sorts now vs Russia, and we've decided to make it financial rather than military so that it doesn't turn nuclear. Analysts think that freezing the Russian central bank, which the west has done, and therefore restraining their ability to intervene with the rapidly falling rouble, could well lead to a financial collapse. I agree that this is preferable to world war. But anyone who thinks they know with 100% certainty what politically results from a financially collapsed Russian state is a fool. One more time: I support the current actions as preferable to world war, but if we are being honest with ourselves, we are about to see even greater uncertainty in world events.",False,1646012056.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,57,0,57,0,0,

To them, that was impressive, as they feel it is harder to defend for days and days consecutively, and that advancement forward in a spear-head manner in to an occupying position is a key to truly being successful.   


These guys feel urban warfare is well suited to the Ukrainians.  


They also wrote about the reason the Russian's captured and occupied the containment zone around Chernobyl in Pripyat. It is a great place to stage armor and fuel tankers and equipment, as any strike on the position by the Ukrainians can break containment of the nuclear waste that exists there. A natural deterrent.  


It was a fascinating read. They also feel that President Putin is extremely frustrated, as it was clear to them that he was executing a plan that relied on the old-school lighting war tactic.

I am getting burnt-out, especially because I care about the plight of the Ukrainians, so much. This feels so awful, mainly because I have been watching live cams and hearing the air-raid sirens, and seeing the aftermath.

Many super rad Redditors have come in and recommended taking breaks, taking a breath, pouring a bourbon. You know. So I offer this -- a story about one of our own in the United States. It is sad at the end, when you consider his life and what happened to him. However it is also uplifting and will make you feel prideful, it will fill your heart....especially because we are looking at war, and the bravery and sacrifices of the Ukrainian Men & Women who stand tall, and alone.

This is the story of C4: Charles Keating IV. He was an Arizona kid who moved with his large and colorful American family to San Diego, Coronado to be exact. And what is in Coronado? The Phillip H. Bucklew Center, where the Navy trains SEALs. BUD/S : Basic Underwater Demolition SEAL training. Our SEALs, what a bad ass group of men.

C4 changed his life. He left the comfort of a well-to-do great American family, he left university after 9/11, and joined the US Navy and went to BUD/S. He became a SEAL, after almost 2 years of the world's most intense and finest military training. 7 months of BUD/S, 6 months of SEAL Qualification Training, and then a months-long work-up in the Teams. He went to Team 1. He became a Chief Petty Officer. He was a fucking bad ass.

Save this link. Or, watch it now to break-away from watching this conflict for a little bit. It is 30 minutes. You'll see how much fun he was, how brightly his star shined. Everyone loved him. You'll see his commitment to excellence. He was not only rad, he was good. And brave. He won the Navy Cross, the 2nd highest valorous award. He also won the Silver Star and the Bronze Star.

Charlie - who the guys in the Teams called ""Chuck Heavy"" - was KIA in 2016 in Iraq, he was fighting in Operation Inherent Resolve, fighting in support of the Kurds. He was fighting on foreign soil. He gave it all. He was 31.

Clearly, Russia are broadcasting obfuscating and jingoistic propaganda. This is as nakedly clear to us in the wider world as it must be domestically. Normally, you should take what Russia say with a large pinch of salt. At the minute, very little of what they're saying is in any way true. They have clearly initiated the war for strategic geopolitical reasons, and they have taken a calculated gamble that the world won't directly intervene.

But as I see it there's a couple of kernels of truth nested in some of their statements that the main US, EU and UK aren't really let be acknowledged. And I think I know why.

The Western World (no doubt influenced primarily by the US) **ARE** deliberately trying to provoke Russia at the moment. The sanctions, rhetoric and actions **ARE** designed to be inflammatory. I believe that this is actually **more inflammatory than most countries initially intended**, and the **external support has been more generous than even Ukraine expected** given that the US have known for months that Putin was intending to invade Ukraine this Spring (there were a good few leaks before Christmas, so you have to assume they and everyone else knew well before this) and that many countries in Europe are going to be very hard hit by the inevitable oil and gas cut-offs from Russia that are coming in the next week or so. (For example, if you examine Ukrainian official requests to the international community from Day 1, practically all of their demands have already been met. Of course, they'd like NATO to come in and blow the Russians to hell and back, but they know that's not realistically going to happen)

 The reasons for this I think could be:

1. The initial Russian advances have given NATO a **huge amount of information about the actual strength and organisation of the Russian army**, given the scale and the fact that the Georgian and Crimean takeovers were essentially walkovers, and the Kazakh intervention was basically without resistance. And it has given them vital information that it can act on that they wouldn't have had otherwise, about how strong they are and how they would fight a larger-scale war. The expectation was probably a large invasion of Donbas region that would be not seriously resisted given the presence of troops in Belarus. Instead Russia has gone all in and also shown its cards, to an extent.

2. Whatever the actual outcome of the Ukraine conflict, it's clear that some of the Russian's **basic physical hardware is in much poorer shape than was previously known.** The stories of Russian breakdowns and malfunctions are too numerous to simply be attributable to Ukrainian propaganda alone. This actually may not be the positive we think, as a cornered and impotent Putin may be as likely to use his big ticket items as he is to be pulled to the negotiating table as a result. Ergo the show of force to deter.

3. They sense that **Putin is under pressure domestically**, moreso than he might have been otherwise. There is a suggestion he's showing signs of early dementia. Again, this is not necessarily a good thing for the US. Russia may have been a bit of a microaggressor for the past few years, but Putin is undoubtedly a strong leader with widespread support. An unstable Russia with a weak leader might not be positive in the long run for world stability. US would prefer to see a domestically strong Putin in charge than a democratic but splintering and unstable Russia which could see the outbreak of numerous small conflicts on its periphery. A weakening Putin needs to go, hence the escalating sanctions to accelerate the domestic pressure on him.

4. The scale of the operation has too **many parallels to Blitzkreig in Poland** in 1939, hence the stronger-than-expected international response pushed by Europe as they fear history repeating itself.

5. **The early contest is more in the balance than was expected**, even if a full scale invasion was predicted. Russia hoped for a quicker initial victory. Even if they succeed, as their superior strength in numbers and equipment and nuclear power would suggest they will, there will be continued resistance to their presence for years to come, even if they succeed in taking out the Kyiv government in the coming days as expected. NATO may smell blood and want Putin trapped as a pariah state fighting an unwinnable war he can't back out of. Ergo, ratchet up the pressure on Russia and support to Ukraine to draw out the conflict.

6. Ukraine are doing a hell of a lot better on the international relations front than was expected. There is very little sympathy for the Russians. Hence, a **lot of domestic political points are being scored by being tougher on Russia than initially intended**. This is a hive-mind effect of sanctions that might be escalating the sanctions and support for Ukraine far more than was initially intended.

7. China **have not rowed behind Russia** in the way that was expected. They have, at best, sat on the fence moreso than was expected. NATO may sense that Russia is more isolated than they expected and are trying to push home the advantage.

8. NATO sense than **an early political settlement could make things way more stable than they were before.** It could suit America if Russia agreed some kind of DMZ on the Ukrainian border, for example. Ergo, it makes sense to play Putin at his own game and ratchet up the sanctions, rhetoric and poorly-disguised military support to Ukraine in order to make Putin less sure of victory and push him towards a definitive political situation that splits Ukraine and Russia far more than they were split in the past.

I should say there are a lot of caveats:

\- We are seeing one side of the story, for the most part. Ukrainian losses are likely to be a tad more than they'll let on - Russian losses a tad more exaggerated (estimating the right numbers is a hell of a lot tougher given that the Russians basically aren't giving loss numbers).

\- Conflicts are most accurately assessed in retrospect when you have the full picture of primary sources to draw on that aren't being influenced by the need to not broadcast certain facts for pragmatic reasons. Determining fact from fiction on the ground during an fresh ongoing conflict like this. is notoriously difficult

\- A swift and overwhelming Russian victory or a peace accord would change the international situation rapidly.

(Should say I fully support the measures taken against Russia from an ethical standpoint, but it's rare that ethics trump pragmatics in international relations).",False,1646013329.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

I think the people of the world are much more similar and aligned than we all realize. Who in their right mind would want to see the invasion of a sovereign nation? 

But all the leaders using this as a way to tout democracy and freedom is laughable. The reason they came together wasn’t because they were Pro-Ukraine, but because they were Anti-Russia.

So what can he do? Only 2 options really, surrender or meet the escalation. He’s not going to surrender as he views this conflict as an existential threat. And he will show that to everyone. He is going to use a tactical nuke. 

If you don’t know the difference, a tactical nuke is “only” 60% the size of the WW2 bombs and has a relatively tiny blast radius of about 1000 meters. They can be fired by artillery pieces so there will be no early warning system.

And they’ve been a part of Russian military doctrine for years. They were present on Cuba with orders to use them, during the Cuban Missile crisis. Had there been a land war in the Soviet era, they were going to use them on the Fulda Gap.

The sanctions have been unexpectedly severe and they seem to have been continually ratcheted up as people got more emotional.  I'm not sure that many in the West who have been pushing for them have thought through what they will ultimately mean.  They essentially mean that the West is hoping for a regime change.  The problem is that unlike the USSR, Russia really has no mechanisms by which this can take place as right now Russia's entire government structure at the top is basically just Putin.

I hope the sanctions force Putin to back down, but I worry that they are just going to force him to lash out as he loses his grip on power.  At this point, what happens in Ukraine is ultimately less important to his future actions than the sanctions, which will essentially force Russia to remake its entire economic infrastructure from the ground up over night.  On top of that, Putin is going to have to do so with the economic infrastructure that acted as his base of support in shambles.  Even if Putin doesn't lash out, that's going to cause huge instability in Russia, which is incredibly dangerous given that Russia has nukes.

Russia is not Syria or Iran.  There are way too many ways this can go wrong.  If the West wants regime change in Russia through sanctions, they need to have a plan for it that prevents Russia from collapsing completely.  Once it collapses economically, it's going to be very difficult to build it back, and a Russia that's unstable long term is as dangerous, if not more so, than a Russia under Putin.",1646013713.0,1646013639.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,-32,0,-32,0,0,

Like just a few days ago the Azov battalion, that are made up of fascists, white supremacists, and Neo-Nazis [posted a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/UkraineWarReports/comments/t23n05/ukraines_azov_defense_battalion_released_a_video/) of them defending Ukraine. This was a battalion that was absorbed into the Ukrainian national guard the very same Ukrainian guard that the west is giving massive amounts of advanced weaponry. 

This isn’t to even mention about a third of Ukrainian’s having [positive feelings](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/poll-almost-half-of-ukrainians-have-negative-attitude-to-bandera-346361.html) about Nazi’s such as Stepan Bandera. 

To just brush this off or call people who point this out Russian-bots (and I have doubt that people on this thread will call me that) is incredibly disgusting. 

Now this does not mean that Ukraine is Nazi state or anything like that. As many people point out far right parties in Ukraine only have one seat in the legislative branch and their president is Jewish. Also does excuse Putin’s invasion of Ukraine? Of course not. But everybody who observes this war should know about the Azov battalion and Ukraine’s general mentality towards Nazis such as Bandera.

Congress [already banned](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/380483-congress-bans-arms-to-controversial-ukrainian-militia-linked-to-neo-nazis) arms to the Azov battalion but now [even people like Senator Mendez](https://theintercept.com/2022/02/18/ukraine-weapons-neo-nazis-bob-menendez/) does not know admits that he does know if the U.S. can stop arms exports to Neo-Nazis. 

Please we should all keep this in mind when sending weapons and aid to Ukraine. To brush off reality will come back to haunt you.",1646009728.0,1646009695.0,t3_t32l5s,t3_t32l5s,,0,-37,0,-37,0,0,

I guess because I am also an American, the values of democracy, freedom, and equality were intermixed with the suffering: ie: one should be happy to suffer in order to keep democracy/freedom/equality. 

So maybe the answer is to change who is the one perpetuating the evil onto the victims of Russia, which is clearly their leader. Obviously there is a whole lot of Russian history to support shitty Russian leaders that use their people in order to feed their ego, and every time that leader has failed. 

I do know that when things got too good, my parents and grandparents would get very nervous- almost like they preferred the suffering. LOL!

If they had done so earlier they thought that all those arms would have just been turned over to the Russians.

I think that the Russians sent conscripts because they thought Ukraine would just roll over. They didn't. 

Z has been amazing through this whole ordeal and really rallied the population. It has been amazing to watch.

Of course, nobody knows where this go will go from here and Putin could get very desperate. We're really only 3 days in to this thing, it could be over soon (if the oligarchs and generals take action) or it could drag on for months and get incredibly brutal.

However, now millions of people are pressuring their government to act quickly, before Russia has a chance to stabilize.

It's entirely possible and West can unironically provide him with some propaganda material so he can call it a success. Anything ranging from ""hey, replace your president, at least on paper and move him to a less important position"" to ""we are pulling back all our forces but we will keep Crimea"" is likely to be accepted.

Heck, for all it's worth they might just say ""our operation was successful, we have defeated all druggy Nazis"" even if nothing of the sort truly happened could be used. Considering that A LOT of Russians actually believe Putin's words and their media I don't see why not.

So it's possible. But I agree this is a dangerous situation overall. Especially since we are way too soon to be celebrating anything.

Focus needs to be on Ukraine and the current sanctions of Russia. ""Brainstorming"" for ""World War 3"" or ""Fallout: real life edition"" sounds incredibly selfish and fantasizing in perspective to people actually, literally, caught up on a war with Russia. There's nothing the reddit hivemind of fantasy fear mongering can accomplish. If you're pro Ukraine, than you are pro Ukraine. No looking back in two weeks and going,  ""you know, I'm hindsight, we should have just given him Ukraine"". If Putin is going to ""HiT ThE SwItcH"" over sanctions, spoilers -*letting up isn't going to make him never do it*. So I don't understand what people's ""real concerns"" are.

* First, NATO is a strictly defensive agreement. If you attack a country and it retaliates you do not get any protection from other members. Arguably defending Ukraine against Russia is NOT the same but, uh, do you really want to flip that coin? 
* Second, if NATO is involved due to one of their members defending - this raises tensions a lot. Military might of NATO eclipses that of Russia. It's entirely possible to literally barricade their borders and shoot everything that approaches. However in this case you may imagine China will directly intervene... and we are in World War 3.
* Third, what do you do in face of overwhelming military and economical power when you are a crazy dictator? You use your nuclear weaponry. Since you are losing anyway then you might as well inflict more damage. 
* Fourth - this will suck to say but no EU country wants to explain their citizens that they are sending tens of thousands of soldiers and weaponry and that a big number of them will NOT come home.

Putin might be unhinged, but the oligarchs and other power players are not. 

You are correct, nothing is certain, but a true total war would place the oligarchs and their families in actual danger as well as absolutely ruin their financial prospects. They will be very disinclined to let things go that far, especially when there is a convenient sacrificial lamb that would satisfy their foes.

My money is on a regime change, and a surprisingly quick one. There will be a lot of atrocities and needless human suffering in Ukraine until then, though. 

The only thing Putin can do to cling to power is win and he will do anything he thinks he can get away with to achieve that. I suspect he has been given a hard time limit and not a very long one.

The Russian military is moving additional combat resources toward Ukraine and establishing more reliable and effective logistics arrangements to support what is likely a larger, harder, and more protracted conflict than it had originally prepared for. The tide of the war could change rapidly in Russia’s favor if the Russian military has correctly identified its failings and addresses them promptly, given the overwhelming advantage in net combat power Moscow that enjoys. Ukrainian morale and combat effectiveness remain extremely high, however, and Russian forces confront the challenge of likely intense urban warfare in the coming days.  
 Russian forces largely conducted an operational pause on February 26-27 but will likely resume offensive operations and begin using greater air and artillery support in the coming days. Russian airborne and special forces troops are engaged in urban warfare in northwestern Kyiv, but Russian mechanized forces are not yet in the capital. Russian forces conducted limited attacks on the direct approaches to Kyiv on both banks of the Dnipro River, but largely paused offensive operations in northeastern Ukraine. Russian forces likely paused to recalibrate their – to date largely unsuccessful – approach to offensive operations in northern Ukraine and deploy additional reinforcements and air assets to the front lines.

Tomorrow will certainly be... interesting (I have unoffically heard that 1 USD was over 100 rubles on Sunday) but it will temporarily get better afterwards before it gets even worse. At this rate Russian economy WILL enter a free fall as they are basically:

* cut off from computer parts - AMD, Intel and TSMC will not supply them. Any company like Asus that would attempt to sell them a PC would be banned from USA. Some chinese companies may try to help 'em but this effectively limits them to ARM, not to x86/x64 aka bye bye Windows. Still, this one will take about a year before becoming a REAL problem (companies don't replace their computers ovenight but inability to do so will pile on)
* cut off from electronics - I am actually not entirely sure if Russia is even capable of creating, say, missile control systems and manouvering mechanisms without imported goods
* cut off from western financing options
* flight related logistic prices have effectively increased by 30%+ (their planes are banned from flying anywhere near US, UK, Europe)
* SWIFT bans, even in very limited scope, are painful. A complete blanket ban on Iran few years back costed them 30% of their GDP.

I have seen analysis that combined sanctions overall will cost Russia around 10-15% of their GDP. As in - every 10th person you see is now jobless.

So when you hear about Kyiv vs Kiev, think more München vs Munich, Firenze vs Florence, etc. Its name in the Ukrainian *language* is Київ, which can be transliterated Kyiv or Kyjiv and is pronounced roughly KEY-you. Meanwhile, its name in the Russian *language* is Киев, which can be transliterated Kiev or Kiyev and is pronounced KEY-yeff. So even Ukrainians, like Zolenskyy, would call it Киев if speaking Russian, because that's just its name in Russian, the same as how you'd pronounce ""Paris"" pa-REE instead of PAIR-iss if speaking French.

What's happening with the correction is that historically, English has used the Russian name, Kiev, but a few years after independence, Ukraine started asking the world to use its name in Ukrainian, Kyiv, instead. So calling it Kiev isn't *wrong*, per se, and is completely normal if speaking Russian. But in English, calling it Kiev has similar connotations to calling it *the* Ukraine

EDIT: Kyiv and Kiev are the usual transliterations. Kyjiv and Kiyev are more scientific/linguistic transliterations

EDIT: Also, if you speak basically any European language that isn't English, and thus pronounce ""Europe"" with sort of an AYoo at the beginning, the second syllable is actually /iw/ in IPA. ""you"" / /ju/ is just a reasonably close English approximation

EDIT: One last remark to help explain things. It has more local names in other nearby languages like Кіеў in Belarusian, Kijevas in Lithuanian, Kijeva in Latvian, etc. It's just that people are typically only familiar with the Ukrainian and Russian language names, since they're the only two relevant to the political situation",1646014307.0,1646013077.0,t3_t32l5s,t1_hyq0fqo,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

No

> what is more effective against large paratrooper carrying transport planes...jets? or antiaircraft missiles?

Depends on the situation. If it's a unprotected transport plane and you control the skies, fighters. If you don't and troops are wherever it is going, anti air missiles. It's always risk vs reward. Using a jet has higher risk of loosing expensive equipment, using anti aircraft missile higher chance of not being able to intercept.

> are all ukrainian fighters falling back to kyiv to defend? or do they keep some forces in all the major cities?

No.

Anti-aircraft missiles are largely more effective than a jet. Primarily a jet would be used to fight in an air-to-air fashion.

As to Russian plans, who knows what those are aside from the planners? Is it effective, probably not without air-superiority. In that case, it is, in fact, theatre. He is just going to keep committing because he believes Ukr. will run out of missiles. Is that true? Based on the response from the West, looks like no.

Ultimately, Putin will be defeated by his paltry responses. When/if he does use deadlier weapons, I suspect it will only strengthen the resolve of the Ukr. people. Eventually, the war will land on Putin's doorstep in the form of a bullet to the spinal cord or a delicious cup of polonium tea. Whatever happens, I don't think it is possible for the Ukr. people to be defeated.

Even if Moscow nukes Kyiv, they will only know resolve. His own troops are already demoralized and flagging. He can send in more, but they will feel the same fate. Everyone thought that Ukr. would be dragged into an insurgency and that was where Russia will fall. It is increasingly looking like Russia might not be able to defeat the regular forces. This is a disaster.

Nuclear warefare doesnt just happen, though there are no parameters in history for it, the likelihood that a nation would use a nuclear weapon offensively in todays day and age is low. Most nuclear buildup is generally a response or self defense technique. For Russia to justify a launch, they would need to be under a severe military threat. Currently, there are no plans to invade Russia by NATO or Ukraine. If Russia is pushed from the Ukraine, they will likely not be followed.

The unhinged madman theory is also far from any guarantee. Putin is mad, but launching a nuclear strike is next level. In Russia, there are safeguards in place for even Putin. He doesnt hit a button and everything goes, to execute a strike, he needs to have his top Military man on board, and servicemembers to follow the order. With the soldiers morale questioning the Ukraine invasion, it seems likely one would stop something from happening(it only takes one person to stop the chain).

That's true. Untrained, with poor equipment, without sufficient logistical support and with horrendously low morale. This worked reasonably well in World War 1. It kinda worked in World War 2. It failed afterwards as modern doctrine is about quality, not quantity. You can have as many soldiers as you want but without artillery, recon and air support they are just sitting ducks. 

Not to mention that as with many nations Russian population is declining. They actually do not have THAT many people aged 18-35 aka actually worth conscripting. Losing them in a war is essentially destroying your own economy. 

> field thousands of tanks

That's partially true. Or to put it better - while tanks have improved a bit over the last 50 years, anti-tanks have improved tenfold. Big slow metal fortresses cost a lot to make, consume shitton of fuel and then a single Javelin turns it into scrap. They are also utterly useless against drone and air strikes.

> detonate all of the US and Europe

They can but then Russia is detonated too. Mutually assured destruction. This makes nukes annoying to use for any attacker as they have to assume they will die too. 

As long as only traditional weaponry is involved Russia's offensive ends in the first NATO country they face. Polish minister once explained this scenario - if entire Russian military power was used then roughly half of the country is indeed razed. Afterwards rest of NATO forces show up and then there's no more of Russia. 

After all Russia's military might is scary against smaller countries but both Turkey and France are capable of defending their territories on their own. Except NATO is not a just 1 or 2 countries.",False,1646013178.0,t3_t32l5s,t1_hypvrgs,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes, that's doctrine.  On the other hand, it seems like that stuff is going *extremely poorly*.

Here's the deal: authoritarian regimes often fuck stuff like this up, because their command structures do not tolerate dissent and collaboration and bad news.  It looks to me like Russia is overextending.

Sure, they'll *eventually prevail*, but they are making so many unforced errors and incurring unnecessary costs.  And beyond that, the Ukrainians are over-performing expectations.

> Russia is threatening to encircle all of ukraines forces in Donbas 

I think it's unlikely Ukraine has that much force committed in Donbas.  The Dnieper is such a natural chokepoint as to make encirclement and losses of such forces obvious.  They needed to leave enough of a credible force there to be an obvious diplomatic tripwire and to harass Russian supply lines.  That doesn't require 45k troops.

Neither of us knows the disposition of Ukrainian forces.

> not the victory of their conventional forces repelling the Russian advance outright

I don't think anyone sane expected that.  We expected a steady, progressive advance that encircled Kiev in 72 hours with minimal losses.  Instead, we're at day 5, with various kinds of yolo-halfassed-blitzkrieg tactics not really working.  And it's getting to the point, like-- will Russia keep making massive unforced errors?

A fact that's been demonstrated during this conflict, yes.

> at all is a red flag as to the state of Ukrainian air defenses.

Russia's had air superiority from day 1.  They *still* don't have air supremacy and freedom of operations in Ukrainian airspace, but I admit they are getting closer to this with time.  Indeed, I'm not sure a few MiGs are going to make much difference.  There's been discussion of sending in *air defense systems* and not just Stingers, which would be a massive gamechanger towards air denial.  It's still not clear to me what this would be: the US doesn't really have any second-tier land based air defense systems, and the Ukrainians can't suitably employ or defend Patriot batteries.

> The fact that the US has escalated to directly sanctioning Russia’s forex reserves and that European countries are actually sending military aircraft (both of these are massive escalations) says that Ukraine’s situation is dire given that such last resorts are being used.

I don't buy it.  A strong response doesn't equal desperation.  In some ways, I'd argue the opposite: if Ukraine fell quickly and more quietly like everyone expected, none of these things would have happened.
