Lithuania is sending a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin after a warrant was issued for his arrest over alleged war crimes.

Its foreign ministry has tweeted a photo of a banner on a skyscraper in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, which reads ""Putin, The Hague is waiting for you"".

It's referring of course to the International Criminal Court - which has issued the arrest warrant for Mr Putin - which sits in The Hague in the Netherlands.

In March last year, Vilnius mayor Remigijus Simasius spray-painted the same message on a road opposite the city's Russian embassy.

The UK has been saying they'd be the first to provide long range missiles, but if Ukraine has no platform to fire them from, then the missiles are useless. And I personally expect that capability to come much sooner than Western jets.

We know the US found a way to fire HARM missiles from a MIG using an iPad. Now they probably tested that on one of the MIGs that were just donated. But they've had six months to develop more compatibility. And pledging all remaining jets means that they won't have any left to test these integrations in the future. Is it possible that they've figured out how to fire any NATO standards missile?

Prigozhin‚Äôs press service was involved in a fabrication of some kind given the Nezavisimaya Gazeta denial, but Prigozhin does not appear to have fabricated the rumor itself.

Prigozhin‚Äôs press service may have received a fabricated press request or may have fabricated the press request itself.

Regardless of whoever fabricated the press request, Prigozhin chose to give prominence to the rumored plot.

ISW continues to assess that Prigozhin promoted the rumored plot to identify Patrushev and the Russian Security Council as enemies of Wagner, set conditions to blame Patrushev for Wagner‚Äôs failures in Ukraine, and other ongoing info campaigns against the RU mil establishment.

There's a poll on reddit about who'd win in a direct war, US or russia. The results as I just saw them 21hrs after being posted, with the voting options and % vote in parens

- 4.7k reasonable responses (""USA""; 76.8%)

- 855 afraid of nuclear armageddon (""Neither, they would tie""; 14.0%)
- 373 thinking their reddit data will be used against them (""Results""; 6.1%)

What I think is interesting is that the number of votes for russia is less than some other polls show shape shifting lizard people ruling the world. It's _that_ low. Or the group skipping to results is one and the same, too nervous to vote.

So much noise around Bakhmut, and that is fair.


**So strategically where will Ukraine go next**

I've managed to get things right many times but the fact is - less surety on this than any analysis before.

Most likely:

- NE direction

- S - SE direction.

The largest impact will be a strike South to Mariupol, Berdyansk or Melitopol (my pick).

This will break the entire Southern theatre. BUT I've been singing about Melitopol for a very long time, so take it with a handful of soap.

**Expectations:**

Heavy fighting in the East for a few months. Then if offensive capabilities for Ukraine permit, so localised work in the NE with some big efforts in the South.

Fact is that there are many areas in the South of Ukriane to exploit that have strategic impacts.

Not even close. It wouldn't even end all human life. Not only are there drastically less nuclear warheads available (about 7k each vs 55k each during the height of the cold war), but especially on the NATO side, the yield of the warheads has shrunk as the accuracy of the missiles has increased. NATO nuclear doctrine additionally focuses on taking out Russian launch sites and intercepting Russian missiles. 

Clearly the damage would be beyond any known proportion and utterly devastating. Even one nuke getting through on a city center would be the single most destructive event in the history of the human race. But despite that, it wouldn't wipe out all life on this planet.

None of that is relevant to my comment. 

You are asserting Ukraine is FORCING conscripts with ZERO experience into 2 months of training on Leopards and Abrams and being thrown into war. 

Do you have a source for that or did you just pull it out of your arse?

Sure, that comes back to the motivation to fight though. The Russian conscripts are more likely to stop caring about the fight they have little interest in.

If Russia attacks Poland(Which they won't) It will unleash the disintegration of Russia and WW3 will likely be on the steps. I get what you mean regarding personnel shortages but as it stands right now, Ukraine is gonna outlive Russia. The means that the West has provided in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia are such boons that Ukraine is on track to beat Russia in terms of available soldiers. When Russia Mobilizes 300k men to fight and 10-30% of them flee the country, it isn't exactly indicative of a Military that has motivated troops. They've lost an Substantial amount of their most qualified personnel and their equipment is becoming outdated quickly.

Russia is on the Offensive. In no way shape or form are they able to control Ukraine unless they officially surrender(which they ofc won't, or they would've already). 
They have to take and hold massive Urban Areas where every window is a possible enemy position. Reconnaisance is impossible to contain and ambushes are possible everywhere. They will lose upwards of 10 men for every dead Ukrainian fighter and when your family is under threat of death, it greatly increases support of anybody who is willing to fight the perpetrator.

You can't simply believe the motivation is anywhere near the same proportions in Russia and Ukraine. There's a difference between propaganda fooling you to commit murder and having to take up arms to defend against people trying to rake everything from you. The Morale of Russia is lacking and Well-documented. Poland will not put troops in Ukraine, no NATO countrt will, Unless Russia ups the ante and use tactical nukes or take NATO lives. If that happens it will be Joint effort to combat Russia while minimizing the risk of Nuclear escalation, although let's be real here, Putin will be long gone if that reality comes to be. The domestic instability of Russia has been transparent pretty much since the war started. Putin is committed to his blunder and he has played himself. Ukraine might lose a BIG chunk of their country if this war effort continues for years but as an independent nation they are coasting bro.
