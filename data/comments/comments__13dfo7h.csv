Day 439-441 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Two days ago, there was a new missile strike aimed at Kharkiv, which doesn’t happen often now, so it was pretty unexpected. Apparently, they didn’t actually target the city itself, but a village Novyi Korotych which is a little to the west from Kharkiv, though we were able to hear all of the explosions and a couple of them were pretty loud, but still somewhat distant. 

The next day our governor said that, surprisingly, this time they were not targeting civilian infrastructure, but instead some transport infrastructure and all of the 6 S-300 missiles that they fired hit the ground instead of whatever they were supposed to hit. A pretty weird target, there doesn’t seem to be much of anything in that village other than some company that manufactures construction materials. 

There was also a bigger missile strike in the past couple of days, and it happened at night again. They fired around 25 missiles at Kyiv and Dnipro and 23 of them were intercepted, which is most likely the highest interception rate we had during war so far. I guess that was the strike where Patriot managed to shoot down the Russian “wonder weapon” Kinzhal missile. It’s great to see that our new air defense systems are being useful immediately after they are deployed, it means that the wait for them was worth it in the end.",False,1683763348.0,t3_13dfo7h,t3_13dfo7h,,0,136,0,136,0,0,

One after the other, the weapons systems deemed escalatory have now been delivered, with no negative consequences.

>In nearly 15 months of war, despite Russian nuclear propaganda and Western anxiety, there has been no use of nuclear weapons. This is an absence worthy of an explanation.

Strategic thinkers point to deterrence and note that nuclear use would not in fact bring a Russian victory. It would ensure a dramatic Western response and make Russian leaders pariahs. But there is a deeper explanation: Russia’s nuclear talk is itself the weapon.  
>  
>It rests on false assumptions. Russian nuclear propaganda assumes that the bully always wins. But the bully does not always win. Russian propagandists want us to think that nuclear powers can never lose wars, on the logic that they could always deploy nuclear weapons to win. This is an ahistorical fantasy. Nuclear weapons did not bring the French victory in Algeria, nor did they preserve the British Empire. The Soviet Union lost its war in Afghanistan. America lost in Vietnam and in Iraq and in Afghanistan. Israel failed to win in Lebanon. Nuclear powers lose wars with some regularity.  
>  
>Some Americans have proposed a nuclear scenario in which Russians will have to use nuclear weapons to head off defeat. But Russia has been defeated in Ukraine, on its own terms, again and again. What it has proved is its ability to change those terms after each defeat. Russia failed to achieve the explicit aim of the “special military operation” to overthrow Ukraine’s democratic government. There will be no greater humiliation than that. Further defeats at Kharkiv and Kherson followed the defeat at Kyiv. Each loss led to cover stories from Russia’s state propagandists and their believers, to talk of goodwill gestures, strategic withdrawals and so on. The escalation has been in the propagandists’ workload.  
>  
>Russia can lose without being cornered. It has 11 time zones of space for retreating soldiers and plenty of practice in propaganda refashionings. Indeed, Russian leaders have already indicated what they will do if they believe that they are losing: change the terms of reference and change the subject in Russian media. ... The assumption in Russian politics is that rhetoric overcomes reality. And the rhetorical preparations for defeat have been made.  
>  
>If Russia detonated a weapon, it would lose that jealously guarded treasure of superpower status. Such an act would constitute an admission that its army has been beaten — a tremendous loss of face. Worse still, neighbors would build (or build up) their own nuclear arsenals. That would deprive Russia of superpower status in the minds of the Russians themselves. That is, for the Russian leadership, the one intolerable outcome of this war.  
>  
>By taking nuclear blackmail seriously, we have actually increased the overall unpredictability of nuclear war. If nuclear blackmail enables a Russian victory, the consequences will be incalculably awful. If any country with nuclear weapons can do whatever it likes, then law means nothing, no international order is possible and catastrophe beckons at every turn.  
>  
>... \[Russians\] see nuclear bullying as their prerogative and believe that others should automatically yield at the first mention of their weapons. The Ukrainians have not allowed this to affect their tactics.  
>  
>...  
>  
>War is unpredictable. Military history is full of surprises. Mr. Putin has undertaken a war of atrocity, and further atrocities are certain as long as the war continues. Russia created not only needless suffering but also needless risk when it invaded Ukraine. We have to work within that world of risk and horror and evaluate it calmly. No option is without hazards; our responsibility is to reduce them. When Russians talk about nuclear war, the safest response is to ensure their very conventional defeat.

If Wagner is legally labelled as a terrorist group, that designation can be used by Ukrainian refugees in the UK to help speed up a court case where they're suing Wagner. It will have other effects too.  

I'll quote a few bits to save a click, but if you're interested do take a look at the article [UK proscribing Wagner group as terrorist ‘will help Ukrainians sue’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/uk-proscribing-wagner-group-as-terrorist-will-help-ukrainians-sue-says-lawyer).  

>McCue, a senior partner at McCue, Jury and partners and the head of the Ukraine civil society lawfare programme, said: “In the claim we filed on behalf of Ukrainians displaced and living in the UK, a designation by the British government that Wagner is a terrorist organisation will be invaluable in terms of speed and cost of persuading a British judge.

>“We estimate that with 180,000 Ukrainian refugees in the UK we could claim a staggering £5bn through damages, displacement and PTSD etc. That money could be taken under existing international law from sanctioned Russian assets in the UK.”

>He added: “A British designation would be welcome in itself, but if it led to an American designation then there would be even sharper teeth due to the American ability to go after Wagner group supporters extrajudicially. Anybody who provided material support to that organisation – even if they are non-US citizens – would then be subject to US prosecution.”  

The article goes on to say:  
>He said the UK designation in itself would have a practical impact on the Wagner group’s operations. “If you start designating, what you do is stigmatise. A lot of soldiers who go and work for mercenary groups have spent their whole lives fighting terrorism around the world. They would not want to go to work for a terrorist group. They will also not want restrictions on their movements. What you create is, you start shutting down and weakening the group and its operational activities straight away.”  

The article mentions there's efforts underway to do the same in France, the EU and America:  
>The French national assembly voted on Tuesday to proscribe the group, a symbolic step that puts pressure on the French government and European Union to act.

>Proscription across Europe would be likely to lead to action in the US, where a large group of senators are already backing a move that would make it increasingly hard for the group to transport personnel and weapons. The US earlier this year had sanctioned far more individual Wagner group members than the UK, as well as a Wagner group foundation.",False,1683777695.0,t3_13dfo7h,t3_13dfo7h,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

From the Guardian: [Ukraine’s Energoatom claims Russia is planning to 'evacuate' nuclear power plant workers from Enerhodar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with:block-645b64658f08c38c98399eb3#block-645b64658f08c38c98399eb3):

>Russian forces are planning to evacuate more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, resulting in a “catastrophic lack” of personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company claimed on Wednesday.

>Ukraine’s Energoatom said it had received information about preparations for the evacuation of about 3,100 people from the southern city of Enerhodar, including 2,700 workers who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company.

>“The Russian occupiers are proving their inability to ensure the operation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as there is now a catastrophic lack of qualified personnel,” Reuters reports it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging service.

>“Even those Ukrainian workers who, having signed shameful contracts, … are going to be ‘evacuated’ soon. And this will exacerbate the already extremely urgent issue of having a sufficient number of personnel to ensure the safety of operation of the NPP (nuclear power plant) even in the current shutdown state.”

>Last week, the head of the UN’s nuclear power watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said the situation around the Russian-held nuclear station had become “potentially dangerous” after Moscow-installed officials began evacuating people from nearby areas.

>Russia’s Tass state news agency said on Monday the Moscow-installed governor of the Russia-controlled part of the surrounding region had suspended operations at the plant.

>Reuters said it was not able to independently verify the reports, and Russia did not immediately comment.  

>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe, and has been under Russian occupation since the earliest days of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia have accused the other side of endangering nuclear safety by firing at the plant. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions into Russian Federation territory.  

And an update to that piece: [Ukraine claims Russia is blocking Zaporizhzhia evacuation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-live-france-calls-on-eu-to-label-wagner-a-terrorist-group-as-britain?filterKeyEvents=false&page=with:block-645b86a78f08c38c9839a0bc#block-645b86a78f08c38c9839a0bc):  

>The Ukrainian army has claimed that Russia is stopping workers and their relatives from leaving Zaporizhzhia, despite organising their evacuation from the area near the Russian-occupied nuclear power plant.

>On Wednesday Ukraine’s state-owned energy company, Energoatom, said it had been told that about 3,100 people were to be withdrawn from the southern city from Enerhodar, including 2,700 who had signed contracts with the Russian-installed company.

>Warnings have frequently been issued over how dangerous the situation at the power plant has been since the invasion last year.

>However the situation looks murkier than first thought. In its daily update on Wednesday morning, the general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said:  
>In Enerhodar, the Russian occupiers organised a so-called “evacuation” for family members of Zaporizhzhia NPP [nuclear power plant] employees. Yet the employees of the power plant are not allowed to leave the city.

Putin said:  


""

**The modern Ukraine was entirely and completely created by Russia, or rather, the Bolshevik, Communist Russia**

...

The Soviet Ukraine emerged as a result of the Bolshevik policy, and even nowadays it can with good reason be called **Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Ukraine**

Now grateful descendants have demolished monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. This is what they call de-communization. **Do you want de-communization?** Well, this quite suits us. But you must not stop halfway. We are ready to **show you what genuine de-communization means** for Ukraine

""

**My take on it:**  


Everyone forgets what he said numerous times, in the same speech - that Ukraine was ""artificially created"" by Lenin -  a communist. 

When you put it in this context, ""decommunization"" means nothing else but destroying Ukraine's statehood.

That’s common of everywhere in the world, and would harm any military, but is overcome by a unifying motivation (like defense of the homeland).  Everything that Russia says is the reason they fight in Ukraine falls short when the Russians arrive and see it was all lies, so they aren’t able to “put away” their old issues.

See, this was talked about more in Ukraine in the first two months—theyre normal humans with issues and resentments just like everyone else.  But they had a unifying motivation—defeat the invaders, protect the homeland.  Former rivalries or animosities are forgotten. They are now all brothers-in-arms.

Actually, there’s a couple of lines about this in the [Fortress Bakhmut](https://youtu.be/OmqLVrUXsTQ) song [turn on English subtitles!]

> *we turn off the pain, the old insults*

> *Here—my shoulder—I’m next to you, brother*

> *There, it’s coming, on the flanks, a new phase*

> *But, we work calmly! As we were taught*

> *over there—is our tomorrow*

> *behind our backs—our children, parents, family there* . . .

He followed that with an invasion of the rest of Czechoslovakia in March, 1939. By doing this, he brought many areas with large populations of German speaking people back into German control but most importantly, he locked in the oil and gas production for use in his later invasions. Germany did not produce enough oil and gas to be able to support any offensive operations very long so Hitler needed to lock in supply. This series of events up to October 1938 led to Neville Chamberlain's famous meeting with Hitler and his speech where he had negotiated ""peace for our time"" with Hitler, basically by giving Hitler everything that he wanted with no resistance or conditions. The French backed up the British in this huge give-away blunder. The statement signed by Hitler and Chamberlain has that famous line ""...symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.""

This agreement bought Hitler the time he needed to work with no outside interference to build and train his forces so that they could attempt to take full control of Europe. A similar agreement signed later in August 1939 between Hitler and Stalin set up a non-aggression pact and that gave Hitler free reign to invade Poland a week or so later without having to worry about the Russians coming to the aid of the Polish, French, British, or other European nations he planned to invade. The Russians at the time were trying to rebuild their forces and launch a new attempt to invade and take Finland and the Baltics (Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia) and later Romania.

It's easy enough to see why, when you give some historical context, Petr Pavel and other European leaders would have no qualms about assisting Ukraine. They have felt the pain of invasion and occupation both by Nazis and by Communists and their societies still remember those years.

Just some random thoughts/opinions. I DO agree with you, but the fog is real: 

- I think this whole stay v. retreat narrative was some psychological warfare in partnership with the West and Ukraine. Feed some crap to the media, they run with it, and you stay the course in reality. Russia's spy capabilities to know the *truth* are up in the air or Ukraine knew they didn't know shit.

- The US knew they had a leak from Teixeira and were urging Ukraine to make some moves because of what happened. Those maps were floating around on Discord in January.

They've been doing this for decades.  

See the timeline on Wikipedia [Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections] in the section Before Donald Trump's 2016 candidacy.  

The story starts in 1977. See this article in the Guardian [‘The perfect target’: Russia cultivated Trump as asset for 40 years – ex-KGB spy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/29/trump-russia-asset-claims-former-kgb-spy-new-book) where it says:  
>“This is an example where people were recruited when they were just students and then they rose to important positions; something like that was happening with Trump,” Shvets said by phone on Monday from his home in Virginia.  

And goes on to say:  
>Unger describes how Trump first appeared on the Russians’ radar in 1977 when he married his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech model. Trump became the target of a spying operation overseen by Czechoslovakia’s intelligence service in cooperation with the KGB.  

Fast forward a bit:  
>Then, in 1987, Trump and Ivana visited Moscow and St Petersburg for the first time. Shvets said he was fed KGB talking points and flattered by KGB operatives who floated the idea that he should go into politics.

>The ex-major recalled: “For the KGB, it was a charm offensive. They had collected a lot of information on his personality so they knew who he was personally. The feeling was that he was extremely vulnerable intellectually, and psychologically, and he was prone to flattery.

>“This is what they exploited. They played the game as if they were immensely impressed by his personality and believed this is the guy who should be the president of the United States one day: it is people like him who could change the world. They fed him these so-called active measures soundbites and it happened. So it was a big achievement for the KGB active measures at the time.”

>Soon after he returned to the US, Trump began exploring a run for the Republican nomination for president and even held a campaign rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. On 1 September, he took out a full-page advert in the New York Times, Washington Post and Boston Globe headlined: “There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure.”

>The ad offered some highly unorthodox opinions in Ronald Reagan’s cold war America, accusing ally Japan of exploiting the US and expressing scepticism about US participation in Nato. It took the form of an open letter to the American people “on why America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves”.

>The bizarre intervention was cause for astonishment and jubilation in Russia. A few days later Shvets, who had returned home by now, was at the headquarters of the KGB’s first chief directorate in Yasenevo when he received a cable celebrating the ad as a successful “active measure” executed by a new KGB asset.

> For quite a while, nobody took the word “defeat” in their mouth, even if they considered the invasion to be an insane choice. That has changed 3/23

> While majority in Russia remains detached and prefers to avoid bad thoughts, those who dare to think are increasingly accepting that the war is likely to end with a defeat 4/23

> That applies perhaps mostly to those who tend to support Putin in this war for one reason or another (mainly because they fail to make difference between Putin’s and national interests). This is a mood I notice in people from various industries, all of them rather elevated 5/23

> Similar mood flows over into the public sphere. Both Prigozhin and Kadyrov play their games, but between the lines they let out the shared assessment of the situation. Kadyrov says ""it is very difficult"", while Prigozhin warns of a looming catastrophe 6/23

> The whole public fight between feudal warlords makes it extremely difficult to imagine this army achieving any success. Their language projects defeat, and this is what I often hear – “I don’t know how this can possibly end with a victory” 7/23

> A recent confession from Andrey Kovalev, one of the major Russian developers, is indicative, too. Putin was feeding the rich people with the stories of how he is going to win it in the end, and now they seem to lose confidence 8/19

> I am no military expert, but I have a better view of morale in the Russian army. It is very low, and the two motives to go to war remain (1) rare chance to earn some money and (2) submissiveness 9/23

> The state-controlled media are preparing the audience for possible setbacks. meduza.io/en/feature/202… 11/19

> Putin’s ability to recruit more soldiers remains significant but limited. Importantly, it is affected by the situation on the battlefield. Nobody wants to be part of a losing army, but that matters more for the sort of motivation dominant among the Russian soldiers 12/23

> These are all early signs, of course, and Putin will be constantly killing the flames. In order to translate into action, these attitudes should rely on some vision of how the future might look like 13/23

> That poses a difficult question. How a defeat might look like? 14/23

> Putin has been pushing the idea that a defeat will mean the invasion of Russia, the country dismembered, the Russian women raped, children slaughtered and crucified, the foreigners ruling the land. Even Kovalev’s ends with stressing that defeat would be a catastrophe 15/23

> Many Russians are convinced that the country is mortally threatened by the NATO forces. Several times I was told by the people I respect as cold-headed that this is all extremely bad, but what can we do – “if we don’t take Kyiv, they will take Moscow anyway” 16/23

> While there is no doubt that Russian people will take significant responsibility for this brutal assault on Ukraine – it is still important to discuss the differential responsibility. The defeat of Putin’s atrocious plans should be separated from the defeat of Russia 18/23

Until the Russian people are fully de-Rashized, they will be back in 30-40 years of licking their wounds, and the civilized world can never be at peace from their threat.

For those who have never had any ties to Russia this war is just that, a war waged against us by our enemies, but for people with ties to Russia this is an unforgivable betrayal. Just because most people here in Kharkiv talked in Russian didn't mean that we wanted to be a part of Russia, but apparently Russians thought otherwise.

Virtually everyone we talked to in the beginning of the war on the streets talked about how their relatives from Russia turned into mindless zombies parroting Russian propaganda. Sadly, the same thing happened to our relatives and friends from Russia, which made us hate them that much more.

It's actually concerning that people from western Ukraine don't hate Russians nearly as much as we do, but I guess I can understand why. Their cities weren't bombed to rubble, they barely experienced any missile strikes, for them this war is something distant, but for people from the eastern Ukraine this is very much personal.

1) Poland would not have to invoke Article 5 over what even in this theory is an accident. In fact, they didn’t - they invoked, or were preparing to invoke, Article 4 - which is basically calling a meeting of NATO allies to discuss what is necessary for the common defense. 

2) Although there is a rationale as to why some NATO allies may have gone along with it, there is no rationale for Zelensky to go along with it, which he ultimately has, presumably after being shown forensic evidence. 

3) Perhaps most importantly, NATO’s security depends on the deterrence factor of Article 5, the guarantee that if you attack one nation you attack them all.

Utter nonsense. That's not how Article 5 works. Like if a Russian spat over the NATO border it wouldn't trigger Article 5 and begin a full-scale invasion of Moscow. Absurd.

Article 5 involves a review process, so even if it gets triggered, NATO countries (or the representatives they've put in place in NATO) must agree that the act was intentional, deliberate, and thus warrants a response under the Article. Just like when Russia sent its fighters over Turkish airspace and Turkey shot them down. NATO met, agreed that it was an appropriate response and defensible under the Article.

The thing is, this may not happen ever. Or at least in the near future. Russian imperialism has been more or less part of the national ethos since 17th century. The idea of russian exceptionalism has long roots, which are difficult to dig out.

We've seen complete transformations in the history. After WW2 Germany was eradicated from the nazisim and from prussian militarism, which again formed much of the basis for willingness to embrace authoritianism in the first place. Japan as well was purged from the ultra nationalism and militarism which gradually took over the society after the Meiji restoration and culminated to statistic and syncretic governments of the 30s and 40s.

The big difference is that both of those countries were completely defeated through unconditional surrender and occupied by allies. They ceased to exist. This gave the possibility to build both countries (that is Japan and West Germany, as DDR remained as Soviet satellite) from ground up with new constitutions, political systems and making sure that the burden of history is not forgotten. It is pretty much certain that this won't happen for Russia. There will be no surrender or occupation. Even after defeat in Ukraine, most russians can probably continue their lives like nothing much happened. Fallout of Putin's failed military adventurism may cause regime changes and we may even see Russia partly disintegrating, but that doesn't mean that they would reflect their past and would try to push a real change.

>On 11 September, the last operating reactor at the plant was placed in cold shutdown, a state requiring less energy for cooling, consequently reducing the danger posed by damage to the plant's connection to the wider energy grid.

There was quite an outcry here in the UK when China was going to work on a new nuclear power plant here in the UK. Then again, yet another outcry when China was going to assist with the rollout of telecoms infrastructure.  

With the telecoms infrastructure there were members of the Five Eyes who said that they'd be forced to withhold intelligence if China was involved with the telecoms network.  

You cannot get much more of a stark warning than that.  

Regarding the nuclear power plant, there was concern that China shouldn't be given any possible leverage to use against us. You can see how this is playing out in southern nations with the Belt and Road scheme. One diplomat from a southern nation said they know they're selling their children's future to China but they have no choice as they desperately need the investments and only China seems to be doing reliable business with them. Climate change is already affecting them, as is the high cost of artificial fertiliser and grain.  

Russia and China are using the blockade of shipments of grain from Ukraine, along with the cost of fossil fuels (which are used to produce artificial fertiliser and heavily affect the price), as leverage against southern nations when it comes to votes in the UN with respect to Russia and this war.  

Even farmers here in the UK feel the pain when fuel prices go up and it prices them out of the artificial fertiliser market.

It is easy to imagine the offers being along the lines of ""Our countries are not willing to risk nuclear conflict over a clear accident, but revealing the accident will cause political turmoil and divide our people's support as some will want to escalate and some not. As such, if we suggest the debris was a Ukrainian air defense missile that malfunctioned we can use that to increase support for transferring our more valuable systems, such as Patriots. Our people's support for your cause is high enough they will not blame Ukraine for using faulty soviet tech to try and defend themselves.

Point 3 doesn't hold much weight for me just because of how frequently there has been direct attacks between russian planes and NATO air vehicles. Article 5 wasn't triggered over the downed drone, the turkish jets, the Syrian infantry. Despite the rhetoric of one toe over the line, NATO has consistently chosen to ignore small cases, especially where it seems likely that it was not russian intent to hit NATO. I assume if it was a russian missile, NATO imposed some behind the scenes threats and restrictions.

The Air Defense S300 missile doesn't have the power to make a crater that deep, the warhead is designed for a shrapnel cone to take out aircraft.

This indicates a removal of radar command guidance sections, installation of strapdown inertial guidance, and heavy reliance on the forward radar seeker. Also a swap of warheads catering to ground to ground operations. 

Missile gets coordinates, reaches apogee, turns on forward seeker, maneuvers to highest radar energy return... in this case a tractor

Russia had moved a ground to ground variant of the S300 from the border of Finland. Training in the russian military really sucks. 

When missiles malfunction they either break apart, nose dive, or receive a ""hold fire"" command to self destruct. There was also a poorly stored missile that ended up having imbalanced solid fuel motors pivot during launch and locked on to its own radar... looked like a boomerang... funniest shit I ever saw.

So WHO is at the top is immaterial to the society below.

The army is a threat because (1) they have a lot of raw violence; and (2) they know that violence is the only logic government is based on.

The government generally weakens the army by encouraging the leaders to exploit their subordinates and compete with each other.

For the government this creates a situation where their is no ""army"" but a bunch of army like units that wear the same uniform.  Thus no one leader or small group of leaders can know that they have the loyalty of the majority of the military.

For the army it creates institutional distrust and internal conflict.

They’re different actions and one does not inevitably lead to the other, even if they are connected.  

That Article 4 meeting ultimately did not take place - what you may be thinking of was the informal huddle of NATO leaders and others at the G7 meeting in Bali after the missiles landed. 

But even here, I consider the possibility of a conspiracy to obscure the true origins of the missile to be low. I’m not saying anything is impossible — all we can deal with is the likelihood of possibilities. 

The idea that, given only a certain amount of information and with a span of 3-5 hours to make their decision and execute the conspiracy, more than a dozen world leaders both concluded that the missiles were Russian and swiftly moved to present an alternate storyline that would have involved the militaries of, at the very least, Poland, the United States and the United Kingdom, then present that conspiracy to the civilian and military leadership of Ukraine while essentially blackmailing them to promote a false narrative under the threat of withholding aid, all while images of the missiles themselves were publicly available on the internet worldwide, strains credibility. Meanwhile, in the more than six months since the strike, nobody from any of the governments involved in the conspiracy, including the government of Ukraine, has stepped forward to call the story false, despite the fact that Ukraine desperately wants greater NATO involvement in this war. 

Finally, the explosion in Poland was markedly different from Russia’s aggressive moves in the air. Two Polish civilians were killed. If world leaders did know it was a Russian missile, they had no way of knowing it was an accident, or a probing strike to see what would happen if the Russians fired on NATO soil. If it was the latter, strikes to try to hit NATO military supplies going into Ukraine could have been next. 

Your suspicion presupposes that they knew it was a Russian missile, and knew  for an absolute fact that the strike was an accident and that there were no more Russian missiles coming, which they could not have known at the time — even if, as I’m sure was happening, the Russians were lighting up back door comms denying it.

Instead we focused our resources towards beating germany first per our deal with the UK while fighting japan in the background.,False,1683765442.0,t3_13dfo7h,t1_jjo4dik,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

That's what you were disagreeing with to be clear.  You are trying to say only democracies can field strong armies.  Pull out all the history you want, democracy is relatively new in comparison to war.  

Now, if you want to stand back a bit and say endemic corruption cripples an army and is more common in other government types..and that it has been a major factor in the overestimation of Russia. Well then I 100% agree.  But to say only democracy can field an effective force is sadly mistaken.",False,1683780201.0,t3_13dfo7h,t1_jjp8fwz,,7,2,0,2,0,0,

Putin launched this war with a speech where he said that Ukraine wasn't a real country or national identity. Using ""Russian"" as shorthand to refer to everyone from the Soviet Union (including Ukrainians) implies that Ukraine is Russia and serves to legitimize Putin's rhetoric.

I understand that for many decades it was very common to use ""Russian"" as shorthand for everyone from the USSR. I understand that the person who you're quoting from probably did so. I'm not saying that the quote is incorrect just that I would prefer ""Ukrainians"" over ""Russians"" for my ideal WWII army composition.

We can't change how people referred to those from the USSR in the past however we can use language now that is both more historically correct and that does not serve to legitimize the war. Ukraine is not Russia and Ukrainian history is not ""Russian history"" regardless of what Catherine the Great, Stalin or Putin say.",False,1683754154.0,t3_13dfo7h,t1_jjnnlwx,,8,2,0,2,0,0,

I only took issue with the specific examples of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.  If you notice, he wrote about the USSR as well and I didn't say anything about that country's armed forces.

Obviously, democracy is newer than war (though longer than some might suspect since ancient Athens, is involved in a number of rather famous wars).
