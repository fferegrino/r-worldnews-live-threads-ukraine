The volunteer centre in Lviv was packed on Wednesday with new soldiers who had signed up to join territorial defence units. Some were in military uniform. Others wore civilian clothes and baseball hats and carried shiny backpacks.

They lined up for the first time in a street on Taras Shevchenko Avenue, named after Ukraine’s national poet. “Raise your hand if you have a car,” their new commander barked. The recruits divided into groups and introduced themselves. Around them snow fell.

“History is happening right now. I don’t want to be on the sidelines,” Vitali, the 35-year-old boss of a Lviv startup said, speaking an assembly point. “I want to make history. Finally the world should know what is evil and what is good. We have the whole world’s support.”

He added: “The main reason we are going to win is because of people.” What was his message for Vladimir Putin? “I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” he said. “He is going to die soon. His regime will fall into dust.”

It seems likely the actual reason this is being fucked up so bad is Russian forces are poorly trained and maintained, army leaders are afraid to tell Putin the truth about any of it, soldiers were not told the real reason for being there, the belief that this would be a cake walk, and the idea that the Ukrainian people would welcome them with open arms.

Keep in mind that this fuck up and poor Russian operation is only miles from their border. They have a direct connection to their country and it's supplies and it's still going this badly. There is absolutely no excuse for it beyond incompetence and poor morale.

I think military analysts are having a hard time figuring out what's going on is because we have our notions of what the Russian military is like and suddenly that seems to be all on its head.

> Seven days into the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it remains unclear how many casualties Russia has sustained.

> The Ukrainian government said on March 2 the “indicative” number of Russia’s losses stands at 5,840 people. Russia has only admitted it had any losses four days after it started the war, and had not given any numbers.

> But multiple videos and pictures from battlefields suggest that invading forces have sustained severe casualties.

> And yet another piece of evidence obtained by the Kyiv Independent sheds more light on the fate of Russia’s 35th Guards Motorized Rifle Brigade in Russia’s war in Ukraine.

> Dozens of Russian military service members were killed in action near the city of Chernihiv as a result of Ukrainian resistance in late February. Afterwards, scores of dead Russian bodies were sent home secretly, without the Russian leadership ever admitting their deaths.

> The Kyiv Independent obtained a WhatsApp audio message recorded by a woman residing in the city of Aleysk in Russia’s Altai region some 3,500 kilometers east of Kyiv, the home base for the 35th Brigade.

> In the voice message, an unidentified woman weeps telling her fellow WhatsApp group member that the local “tank brigade” was “totally destroyed in Ukraine.”

> In particular, she mentions that “just 18 out of 150 guys survived,” probably meaning one of the brigade’s formations was destroyed by Ukrainian troops. Besides, the speaker says the first batch of 45 coffins, mostly young people from the town and villages nearby, were coming to Aleysk on the day of the recorded voice message.

> The weeping woman also says some of the killed were her neighbors and acquaintances. She particularly mentions a military service-member named Evgeniy Zhilin. This name can be found in the leaked register of 120,000 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in the invasion of Ukraine published on March 1 by Ukraine’s Center for Defense Strategies, a think tank. There is also a deleted VK social media account of a Evgeniy Zhilin from Aleysk.

> According to the woman, the killed were mostly very young men. The local community found out about their deaths the day before the recording was made, and it mourned the loss.

> The revelation is partially confirmed by several pieces of evidence about Russia’s 35th Brigade’s involvement in Ukraine. It is known that the brigade’s armored formations were destroyed in armed clashes near the city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, on Feb. 26, with lots of manpower killed or taken prisoner.

> The Ukrainian military on that day particularly reported seizing Major Leonid Shchetkin, who served as a chief executive officer and deputy battalion leader with Russia’s military unit No. 41659, which is the home base for the 35th Brigade.

> In addition, Ukrainian troops posted a video showing surrendering Russian soldiers openly admitting to being service members with the brigade based in Aleysk.

> Notably, this is not the 35th Brigade’s combat debut in Ukraine — in 2014, its formations were seen engaged in combat against Ukrainian forces in Luhansk Oblast in eastern Ukraine.

> Meanwhile, Russian leadership continues to refuse to publish any exact data on casualties of its war in Ukraine. In most cases, Russian propaganda outlets report on Russia’s “special military operation in Ukraine” saying that no Russian casualties have been sustained.

> But as of early March 1, the Ukrainian military reported as many as 5,710 Russian manpower casualties since the all-out invasion’s first day on Feb. 24, which is comparable to Russian military losses in the two-year-long First Chechen War.

> In its worst defeat in Donbas against combined Russian-militant forces in Ilovaisk in late August 2014, Ukraine lost a total of 366 combatants, according to an official investigation.",False,1646230641.0,t3_t4xoyy,t3_t4xoyy,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

A Ukrainian government official told Politico Monday that Ukrainian pilots were already in Poland to start the process of taking control of the 28 MiG-29s they are expecting to be donated.

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

483646240eccca7d981f9d1525c60fc4,t4xoyy,hz1hh26,"I have been thinking about this for the past 24 hours after watching an interview with Julia Ioff (for those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1HWNcLDK88&ab_channel=FRONTLINEPBS%7COfficial).  The RU/Putin is terrified of uprising.  We all kind of know that based on what we hear and see from what news is allowed to leave but she puts it into stark reality the hatred and fear of these types of movements.

My question for those who may have much more information on this, what are the chances of helping stop this advancement and delirium of a Soviet-era Russia with a grass roots movement in Belarus?  Based on what Julia says the Maidan protests were the turning point for Putin when the Russia-leaning (lets be honest here, Russian backed as the vote rigging has been made clear) President Viktor Yanukovych was forced out under threats of dividing Ukraine. From then on Putin has had his eyes on suppressing Ukraine as he believes it to be a West-funded operation meddling in his affairs.

What would the likelihood of success be in having a movement in Belarus or Transnistria that attempts something similar?  From my very cursory understanding, Belarus has a democratically elected leader in exile in Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.  While I am sure she doesn't want her people murdered in the streets by the Putin puppet Lukashenko, now is an opportune time to sow the seeds of an uprising against this.  A decent portion of Russia's military in the region is obviously in Ukraine with reports of about 75% of it (~150,000 personnel) deployed in that invasion.  If the people stood up and attempted to force change the time for it would be now when Putin's under crushing sanctions, a good portion of his active military is currently preoccupied, and while I am sure Lukashenko is no small matter to deal with, Putin and his generals would probably not be able to focus enough attention there to really stop an uprising.

This is especially the case in Transnistria, a breakaway Republic in Moldova.  There's some reports that there are only like 400 Russian active forces deployed there.  While I am sure they are heavily armed, 400 vs. a region with a population of close to 500,000 is overwhelming odds. 

This is of course if they wanted this movement.  I have no doubt there are some people in the old USSR sphere that do wish to be back with Russia, but based on the outpouring of support against this war and seeing dribs and drabs coming in from friends who actually lived under USSR rule and talk about how much it sucked, I imagine the support is not actually very deep.

Edit:  I want to add that I do not think bloodshed is the answer and I am not advocating for more war and oppression.  I am just wondering what the chances of a more democratic way, by definition, could be introduced in times of struggle?

He will save that capability for incursions into Russian territory. If Leopard IIs and Abrams were knocking on the door of St Petersburg, sure, then he might use it as there’s nothing left to lose at that point.

Right now, even if he is defeated in Ukraine, Putin still has ALOT left to lose.

I really don't like to jump on the bandwagon, and I dunno what about this situation has rang such a bell in my heart.  I remember Day 1 when the first reports of shelling happened, when Putin made his declaration.  Was a little after midnight, for me, when I started to see it.  I remember the street cam of the little girl on the bike.  Zelenkys first speeches.. the whole worlds reaction..  But even then I can't fairly say why it had my complete attention.

Been other wars in my lifetime.. I'm ashamed to admit I barely know a damn thing about them, other than the names.  I barely knew about Ukraine or this whole situation until a week ago.. I can't pretend I'm better than anyone, I'm not.  But I haven't felt the same since and the World hasn't either.  I hope that feeling sticks.  Again, for myself and for the whole World.

I hope for only better days for Ukraine, for the Russian people, shit for any of you.  Take care of yourselves, everyone.

Like, the news on Biden's SOTU was literally just a summary of his speech. And any information from the Russian government is almost always characterized as a ""claim"".

But that I’m not so sure of; my gnawing fear tells me that with Russia in the midst of economic warfare equivalents to a nuclear bomb going off that out of sheer desperation he would launch a “small” strike as to 1) show Russia will use weapons that can cause MAD (shake the West) and; 2) try to coerce Ukraine into surrendering (similar to US nuclear strikes against Japan in WW2, but not that big).

I don’t think most understand that Putin is quite literally backed into a corner; a dictator with nothing to lose yet everything to gain. We are expected to believe that the Russians with rise up, military leaders won’t follow Putin’s order, and that this problem will work itself out as rational as possible. Yet, as we’ve seen from footage,these damn Russian invaders have no idea what or why they’re there, and I’m to believe nuclear weapons won’t be used here?

I’m not saying they will, just that the likelihood is greater than we’re being told. I personally think it’s higher than in the Cuban Missile Crisis, though it may not be total MAD.

However Controversial, the US and the UK should have been the ones threathening WW3 and nuclear war against Russia should it invade, because they'd be obliged by the agreement to intervene.

It is their failure to do so that caused this conflict.


Edit: downvotes are perhaps justified because I worded this too hastly and nuance is very important, clearly.

So let me clarify: yes, Russia is the prime and only agressor in this conflict. Fuck Putin and the whole jadajada.

What I meant is that (with hindsight ofc), if the US or UK had played an unhinged role like Putin is doing now. Threathening nuclear war and all without anyone knowing for sure if he actually would do it or not (quite litteraly madman-brinkmanship)

Than there would have been talks and everything and there would have been a huge unrest in the world.

But I think that it would have forced Putin to cancel his plans to invade because the risk of nuclear war would have been too great.",1646229813.0,1646229143.0,t3_t4xoyy,t3_t4xoyy,,0,-54,0,-54,0,0,

But this feels different. This is the type of war that people like me( *add to blacklist*) have pretty much been waiting for.

Younger cosmopolitan Russians - due to exposure to digital media - are fully aware of the reality of the situation in Ukraine, and find it as deplorable as the rest of us. Many are trying to protest and speak out but many have been arrested (12 days in prison and a ~$125 fine, which is relatively hefty amount in Russia). Second arrest fines increase 10x plus jail time. The jails are full so some are transferred out of the city. Some of the guys I know have been issued letters demanding conscription. 

Older generation is fully indoctrinated and continues to believe this is a peacekeeping mission and blames the west. I have even heard them saying they believe the Ukrainians are shelling their own people or the videos are fake. Their views are so extreme that seeing their lifelong friends in Ukraine being turned into refugees doesn’t appear to affect them or induce an emotional response. “They will be home in 2 days” I have heard. It is honestly like talking to a brick wall, and this is a near ubiquitous experience for younger Russians across Russia. 

Being exposed to both sides of this, including the Russian media coverage, I have seen many more crazy things over the last few days.

Economic crises can spark political revolutions, and Tajikistan shares a border with China’s westernmost province, Xinjiang.

Even IF he had captured Ukraine in 2 days, those sanctions would still be put in place, Ukraine would still be recognised as an 'occupied state', guerrilla warfare would continue and western assistance would still pour in.

If they'd understood him and the people of Ukraine, perhaps they could've gotten aid and more weapons before this went to hell and had sanctions ready to go the moment Russian troops crossed the boarder. Instead they underestimated Zelensky's leadership and had to move fast when Russia invaded, but it may have been too late. 

I honestly don't feel like we can call America a superpower anymore. If we were, we'd have sent troops into Ukraine for ""training"" or some other bullshit reason as a deterrent. I honestly don't understand why counties wanting to join NATO aren't given some military protection to deter exactly what happened. What is the point of the American military if all we can do is provide intelligence, while ordinary people fight for Europe? I understand the MAD theory, but Putin is no longer living in that world. He sees nukes as offensive weapons, uses them to threaten everyone. China and India should be firmly on the Ukrainian side in this specifically because of US economic pressure. The countries we're allied with are ones that hate Russia, not because the US is a superpower (obviously our backing on the sanctions helped, but they were driven by the EU). 

I get the nuke threat but I still think it's a bluff. No, I don't want to see what would happen if a nuclear war started, but at the same time, I also don't want to live in a world where Putin can get away with invading a democratic country and killing everyone. If he gets away with this, which may happen, what does that mean for other countries? For chemical attacks? For biological attacks? Look at the murders in England, there's no reason he couldn't have had them killed with a gun/knife/strangled/etc. but he was making a point that he's untouchable. We have nukes and spend an insane amount on our military to defend against Russia, but we're letting Ukrainians die. 

This isn't aimed at you or anyone else, I'm just having some serious issues with all the talk of ""super yachts"" when people are dying. The Ukrainians fought very hard for their democracy.

Losing a conventional war and rebuilding is 10/10 times more preferable to everyone over a Nuclear war where you’re dead anyway.

Ukraine is right next door to Russia, with Kyiv less than 100 miles away, joined by actual roads. Russia supposedly has advanced air assets and special forces. If they were using modern tactics, they should have been able to capture the airports and key positions in the major cities quickly, followed by infantry once the initial positions were secure.

Instead, it appears that the Russia doesn't have combined forces doctrine. The air force doesn't know how to coordinate air strikes with the army. Instead, they are forced to using artillery to reduce cities to rubble like this was WW2. The military clearly does not have readiness for an operation of this scale. They can't properly coordinate logistics, so their front line units surge ahead of support and then run out of food and fuel, so their troops either surrender or pillage.

The economic sanctions will require them to act. They can't digest them,  they're going to choke on them.  These are the options I see:

1. Double down. NATO isn't going to step in on behalf of any non-NATO countries (probably). 
2. Remove Putin. We probably already have conditions on lifting the sanctions if they have a less war hungry leadership group. 
3. Absorb Ukraine and chill. Least likely path. Sanctions mean they're already cooked - occupying a non-compliant Ukraine with their current lack of resources is suicide.

Basically what we have now is a long term waiting game. Russia will continue to grind away at Ukraine's territory and in all likelihood will overall be taking it bits and pieces at a time. Demoralized and poorly supplied though they are, there's just a LOT of Russian army to throw around.

One of three things will happen:

 * Russia chooses to stop.
 * Ukraine chooses to surrender. (Unlikely.)
 * Russia's economy falls apart so hard they HAVE to stop.

The first option has a variety of potential reasons for them, but mostly includes things like ""Putin is overthrown"", so it's not unlikely. Even in the case of an official/legal surrender from the Ukrainian government, the people will almost certainly not stop fighting as long as they can, which means that the Russian army will have to stay as occupiers indefinitely, during which time the sanctions against Russia continue.

Really at this point the most likely end is that third option. Exactly at what point Russia's economy fully collapses instead of merely ""is plummeting""? Hard to say. Could be days, could be weeks.

In short, this isn't going to end soon, and even though Ukraine is likely to win in the long run, it's going to be a painful victory.

 >Operation Deliberate Force was a sustained air campaign conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), in concert with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) ground operations, to undermine the military capability of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), which had threatened and attacked UN-designated ""safe areas"" in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War with the Srebrenica genocide and Markale massacres, precipitating the intervention. The shelling of the Sarajevo marketplace on 28 August 1995 by the VRS is considered to be the immediate instigating factor behind NATO's decision to launch the operation.
 
**[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia)** 
 
 >The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) carried out an aerial bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War. The air strikes lasted from 24 March 1999 to 10 June 1999. The bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces from Kosovo, and the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo, a UN peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.

Taking Ukraine is very plausible for Russia. Holding it is not. Just as an example... Western Counter-Insurgency doctrine estimates you need 20 Troops per 1,000 local population to effectively clear, hold and build. Less than that is asking for trouble. Ukraine has a little over 44 Million People. Let's say 40 million for ease of math. That means you'd probably need somewhere in the neighborhood of 800,000 troops to hold and pacify the country.

800,000 troops (which is more than Russia has on active duty) deployed in perpetuity to a country is ***extremely*** expensive. For context, the US never had more than 300,000 simultaneously deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan and it cost them Trillions, with a T, and they were far from successful in either place. 

Most likely scenario? Russians bleed Ukraine white and turn themselves into an international pariah state cut off from the world in the process, ala North Korea. They take Ukraine and fail to hold it as it degenerates into a vicious insurgency. While their economy crumbles and resentment simmers at home.

Some days I work myself into a complete panic attack, mentally unable to cope. Other days (mostly when I'm not roving Reddit or the news) I'm able to keep myself a bit calmer and life almost feels normal, but with this nagging itch at the back of my brain about the reality of what's going on.

My Finnish husband is able to keep a super cool head about the whole thing, and stresses to me that \*if\* something (big) were going to happen, it probably would have already happened. Also... \*if\* something is going to happen, there's nothing we can do about it, so it's a waste of energy to stress. You feel helpless because you are (in this situation, I'm sure you're not a helpless person otherwise ♥). Unless you can personally get to Ru and take him out yourself... There's nothing we can do.

Spend the time we know we have well, just in case. It's sort of the same as every time you leave the house, something unfortunate \*could\* happen. Every day we live is a risk to our lives, anything could happen at any moment. We don't worry about dying when we wake up and take a walk to the shop, but it is a reality that could happen without us being able to do anything about it.

Also, I keep reminding myself (and we all) need to remember that dropping a nuke isn't as simple as pressing a button. There's a chain of command it needs to go through, and that chain of command has families. If a nuke flies, it'll probably be countered before it even leaves Russian airspace and thusly, takes Russia and said families/chain of command out. It would be suicide, and not only for Putler. He knows this as well, and he is really afraid to die. All we can hope is that somewhere along that chain of command, they also take the situation into their own hands and... Well yeah, bye-bye Putler. I feel sort of like this is coming closer to reality. We can only hope.

My mom, who is in her late 70s, had to do drills every day as a child where they hid under tables in case of air raids. She survived the cold war, where nuclear threats were a thing as well. We have been spoiled for generations where we didn't even have to think about this, so it comes as a shock to the system. Nukes and the threat of war have always been around, Putler is just bringing it starkly into contrast.

This war is likely going to go on for a long time, try not to sit on Reddit/looking at the news, you'll do your heart and mental health a favor, trust me. I know.

Please feel free to reach out any time if you want/need to talk ♥

לאדם הנורמטיבי אשר יודע היסטוריה, באבי יאר הינו מקום מיוחד בקייב. מקום מיוחד באירופה. מקום של תפילות. מקום זיכרון של אלפי ומאות אלפי אשנים אשר נרצחו בידי הנאצים. מקום בתי הקברות העתיקים של קייב. מדוע להפוך מקום כזה למטרה לתקיפת טילים? אתם הורגים את קורבנות השואה פעם נוספת.
בימי הסובייטים, מרכז טלוויזיה הוקם מהיסוד, כמו גם מרכז ספורט. נבנה פארק, על מנת למחוק את ההיסטוריה הנושאית של באבי יאר. אך מדוע הוא הופצץ? פעולה זו הינה מעבר להבנה האנושית. מתקפה שכזאת, מוכיחה שבשביל רבים ברוסיה, קייב הינה לגמרי זרה. הם אינם יודעים דבר על בירתנו, על ההיסטוריה שלנו. אך למרות זאת, הם הורו להשמידאת ההיסטוריה שלנו, את המולדת שלנו. להשמיד את כולנו.
ביומה הראשונה של המלחמה, אומן, הופגזה בצורה מאסיבית. המקום בו מאות ואלפי יהודית מגיעים בכל שנה להתפלל. לאחר מכן- תקפו את באבי יאר, היכן שמאות אלפי יהודים נורו למוות.
אני פונה כעת, לכל יהודי העולם-  אינכם רואים מה מתרחש כאן?  ולכן חשוב שמיליוני היהודים ברחבי העולם לא ישארו דוממים למראות הללו. מפני שהנאציזם נולד בדממה.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. It has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian Eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Japan calculated that if it invaded Indonesia then the US would declare war on it anyways, so might as well hit first and hope to set the US back several months in its military effort.

In other words, If Japan thought that it could capture the oil without triggering the US to enter the war, Japan would not have attacked.

The unpalatable truth is that this is, in the long run, a good outcome for the west. Putin has spent over two decades buying influence, corrupting Western political leaders, buying up institutions, weakening NATO and the EU, pulling the world into a scenario where it is dependent on Russian natural resources and money.

That has ended overnight. Russia is weaker now than it has been since the end of the Cold War. They are economically isolated, they have no influence and no role to play. They will face a long, crippling insurgency that will cost them a huge amount of money and lives and that can never be won. 

No matter what happens now, that genie is not going back in the bottle. Russia could crush Ukraine tomorrow, they could withdraw entirely, whatever - it doesn't matter. They will never be able to recover what they've lost over the last week. The West has taken this opportunity to reverse everything that Putin has done over the last two decades and Russia will never be able to do it again. Russia is out of western society for good. 

It's awful for the Ukrainians but the cancer of Russian money, influence and resources has been cut out of the world for good by their sacrifice.",False,1646229632.0,t3_t4xoyy,t1_hz1qdby,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >A nuclear weapon (also known as an atom bomb, atomic bomb, nuclear bomb or nuclear warhead, and colloquially as an A-bomb or nuke) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (""atomic"") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ). The first thermonuclear (""hydrogen"") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT (42 PJ).

Putin’s playing a game of chicken to test that assumption.

If it ever gets to that stage (like Nato intervening with forces in Ukraine), Putin’s gambling that tactical nukes used locally there wouldn’t trigger tactical nuke retaliations by the West as it could potentially escalate to ICBMs and MAD, so he thinks that the West could be spooked to cutting their losses and just let him claim his spoils.",False,1646225798.0,t3_t4xoyy,t1_hz1k08s,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Funnily, my mother said the same thing. That it was more a spectre and seemed more real when she was a child in the 60s. My dad, being Slavic (Czech) is much more ambivalent because he never knew about it as much living inside it. 

I hate so much how our hands are tied with just economic sanctions because of this fear. The stories out of Ukraine, and indeed anywhere in the world where we have turned a blind eye, are heartbreaking. My heart wishes for the conflict that needs to happen, but my brain knows we simply cannot. I'm increasingly glad men and women far smarter than me are the ones in control from NATO, the EU, the various country militaries and government.

of their elders.

I just think that in a world filled with unjust wars, some are just more just than others. I can MAYBE see why Bush Jr. and the west attacked Afghanistan/Iraq whether you think it was wrong or right.

You know what I can’t understand in my most pessimistic, angry and drunken state? A former super power invading a country that most of us have frankly(facetiously on my part here) written off as a potato farming country filled with nice people but barely worth remembering for your high school/college history exam.

I live a stone’s throw away from a Ukrainian church. I am just finding out how many Ukrainians live near me in Canada. I like to think I am more open minded than most people. I can imagine a young American boy being angry at brown people and Islam and terrorists after 9/11, even if I don’t agree with him, even if I know in my heart of hearts that the young man has more testosterone and anger than sense and experience.

But with all my shower thoughts/stoner thoughts and arm chair wisdom, I can’t fathom the ignorance that would lead to an adult Russian justifying shooting a missile a Ukrainian civilians. 

I admit I haven’t gone out of my way to watch Russia news. I don’t know what they are being told. But my instincts tell me that you don’t shoot missiles at a neighbouring country filled with people with similar beliefs and even the same skin colour, that in western media and late night shows is considered more of a punchline than North Korea at the worst of times.

I want peace. I believe in peace. But every single invading force that steps force into Ukraine is lucky they don’t get a round between the eyes. Right or wrong, invading forces whether they be brain washed children or bitter old men, I can’t fault a peaceful country for defending itself. Should I Iet the Queen herself “take back” Canada because she decided she doesn’t think Trudeau is doing enough for our natives? Lots of Canadians would agree, this is an extreme hypothetical, but at what point are Canadians supposed to lay down and say “Well we did did them dirty. Let’s let out former emperor enact martial law on is for a year or 2 until she decides we are responsible enough.”

But there is no easy answer to war unless you are an absolute pacifist or an absolute survivalist. At some
point the goal, the actor, the “noble intentions” doesn’t matter when their solution to the problem is to kill you. When an orphaned, desperate beaten and raped 14 year old breaks into your home and draws a gun on your family, do you know what you are supposed to do “as a man”, “as a patriot”, “as a protector of their family”? You put two to three rounds in their chest, AND THEN you try to save them, AND THEN you try to redeem your conscience, your soul, save face in the presence of any saviour your pray too.

You don’t just let the angry teenager take over your home and ruin your way of life. If God is real and has any mercy, he will forgive the young men and women who were duped, uneducated, or didn’t have the strength of their convictions. And if I am misinformed I hope he/she can forgive me for my rush to anger. But It’s up to the rest of you to make sure we don’t repeat the same mistakes again.

Firstly, the UN is not a joke. It is very effective at some things. It is about dialogue and diplomacy, which is that that stands between nation states being at war. You don't know about how effective it is, because it has prevented conflicts which otherwise would have happened. Its complex, and there's a lot of hate on the UN. It isn't perfect by any measure, and it has also been involved in awful things (or at least its representatives/employees have) but it is the best thing we have. 

Second, these things should be recorded and evidenced out of respect for the victims, as well as for history. The UN is the best place for this, because it is the only forum in which all independent nation states are members (as far as I'm aware) and is therefore really the only place. 

Additionally, it isn't impossible that, in this case, the perpetrators may face prosecution in the ICC. We don't know how this will turn out, so it isn't impossible.

 >The Russo-Ukrainian War is an ongoing war primarily involving Russia, pro-Russian forces, and Belarus on one side, and Ukraine on the other. Conflict began in February 2014 following the Revolution of Dignity, and focused on the status of Crimea and parts of the Donbas, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine. The conflict includes the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014), the War in Donbas (2014–present), naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and political tensions. While trying to hide its involvement, Russia gave military backing to the separatists in Donbas.

THOSE missiles are the real business, meant for huge area denial of aircraft. They are also very expensive, at least a million a piece. For reference, the missiles fired by the US' Patriot Missile system cost $1-6M a piece.

So while something like a shoulder fired rocket WILL work for taking out these drones, the issue it that for the most part those rockets rely on you as a random human to know that it is there and where it is.

Russia's problem is that those systems in question are horrrribly expensive and relatively ""rare"" as far as equipment goes. They are really meant to be moved into a location and then emplaced for relatively long stretches at a time, though they are sometimes mobile enough to allow for a ""shoot and scoot"" style set up.

And whenever these drones spot those missile systems, they become priority targets for obvious reasons.

Not to mention the other problem Russia has, Ukraine still has actual planes and helicopters in the air. As painful as these drones are, they can only carry 4x45-pound bombs at a time.

- communication, reports started a few days ago that they have close to none, and the one’s they have are mobiles and civilian analog (open) handhelds, that EVERYBODY are now listening in on.

-logistics, we see A LOT of vehicles that are basically dry on fuel, some also seem to be running low on ammunition. Food an water must be insufficient, as Russian crew are raiding locals.

-Command and control. As the COM issue becomes worse the further they get into Ukraine, we can expect Russian units to basically loose connection with their commanders. I expect we’l see that this war is now run by whomever is driving the lead vehicle, going “that way, I think (do you have a map?)”.  I’m not even going to comment on the planning side of this invasion, never look a gift-Horse in the mouth.

-will to fight.. the disposition and decision to fight, act, or persevere — is the most important factor in war. From what we have seen so far, the lukewarm interest shown by Russian troops seems to point to a gap between what they will do, and what their leader’s expected. Make no mistake, the Russian Army is a mighty force to be reckoned with, and we’ve not really seen any actual offensives yet, just incursions. 

Going forward. 
Material for killing are flowing into Ukraine, this is going to get worse, and unless something happens soon, we will be looking at ten’s of thousands of death, not thousands. Should we enter into a urban war situation this will be an absolute nightmare. All these towns/cities that change ownership every other day I expect are due to the small number of invader/defender forces that are being deployed, you can not expect to hold a city of 1,5mill (pre war) with 200 soldiers.. and so the wheel turns, until the Russians decide to push or pull back.

These maps we see.. of “areas under control of Russian forces” are just plain wrong. They do not control those areas, people do not want them there, they control the road they are on. As such, should the Ukraine be in a position to be able to field strategic units to those areas, we might see a Russian collapse.

The big stories coming out in recent days with any quotes from us intel are all ""what happened to Russia's plan to quickly take Ukraine and how it failed"" type stories. The rush to take Kyiv was due to Russian strategy to ""cut the head off the government"". If you're questioning why people assume Russia wanted to take Ukraine quickly you either weren't paying attention to anything leading up to the war or you're engaging in bad faith.

Nä, inga problem. Är nog själv lite överargumentativ för tillfället. Så jävlä förbannad på Putin, fy fan sånt skit. Får väl hoppas att ryssarna själva störtar honom.
