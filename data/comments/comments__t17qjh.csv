Russia is desperate to get Ukraine to surrender and/or take over Kyiv in the next 24 - 96 hours as the international community support for Ukraine intensifies.

Now that they've incurred a number of losses of military personnel and equipment it would seem that Russia is now intensifying their siege. What is scary though is that they likely percieve the aid from other countries as being very detrimental in the form of drawing this out longer than the military plan indicated.

From that view, Putin and his team fully expected the sanctions that have already come down and were prepared to accept them as a consequence of taking Ukraine. What matters then is what Putin doesn't expect - poor morale from his troops, unexpectedly forceful counter ops by Ukraine, rising public discontent from Russian citizens, restraint of US and NATO allies from engaging into the war effort but still supporting Ukraine.

They have shot dead children in the street with their Mothers and Fathers. Rather than taking prisoners, they are killing the soldiers defending their home. They are arresting the few that are brave enough to protest.

The headlines that reach us in the West pale in comparison to the hour-by-hour reality that is being experienced in Ukraine as we speak. I am in a position where I am getting the news from there almost instantaneously, and what I am witnessing compared to the news that reaches us in the UK, is horrific. Even though it is the largest attack in Europe since World War 2, the things that I saw yesterday morning are only being reported now, and it is a worrying sign of the disassociation that Europe is exhibiting from the heinous war crimes that are being committed in what is, and should remain, a free country.

What Putin and Russia are doing isn't just an invasion of Ukraine, but an attack on our modern principles as free people. It as an attack on the democracy, freedoms, and peace that we all enjoy everyday in the West. These are things that should never be ripped from anyone.

Erdogan, who has a complex relationship with Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin as well as close ties with Kyiv, said he was disappointed that the west had not shown a ‚Äúserious, determined‚Äù stance in response to Moscow‚Äôs assault on its neighbour.

  
Nato should have taken a ‚Äúmuch more decisive step‚Äù, the Turkish president said, adding: ‚ÄúI hope that today‚Äôs Nato summit will present a much more committed stance.‚Äù

  
The Turkish president, whose nation has been a Nato member since 1952, caused dismay among his western allies by buying a Russian-made S-400 air defence system that was delivered in 2019.

  
At the same time, however, Erdogan has confronted Russia forces in conflicts in Syria, Libya and the Caucasus. Turkey, which has condemned Putin‚Äôs assault on Ukraine, has also supplied the Ukrainian military with armed drones through a company owned by the president‚Äôs son-in-law.

In the lead up to WWI, New technologies created a lot of economic competition as nations sought resources, economic advantage, etc. for the new technologies. Germany and Britain, specifically, with steel production pop into my mind.

Second, the conflict started with one larger, though aging, power trying to quickly defeat a smaller, vulnerable nation.

Third, a series of defensive pacts led to a conflagration of conflict as nations honored alliances, until eventually all major powers in Europe and their sphere of influence were at war.

And it's interesting because it seems like Ukranians aren't dehumanized in the eyes of the Russian people or Russian military. They view them more like lost kin, so they aren't as willing to kill them.

I think Putin will face much more resistance at home than he thought, also...This isn't the 1960s. The Russian people have much more exposure to outside thought than they did during the height of the Soviet Union. They are online. They are able to access and consume media from the West through VPNs, etc. Many have traveled throughout the world. It's not North Korea where they have a captive audience that only gets beamed in with one channel of information.

Heck, it's not even China, which I think does a much more thorough job of limiting Chinese access to other parts of the world.

- Giuliani just gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics. 

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting or voting for Republicans or some 3rs party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties) 

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

It's a page that attacks russian news sites by denial of service. How it works is that it's telling russian servers that you want to see their webpages many times per second.

This overloads their servers if enough people do it. You can try to visit e.g. rt.com manually to see how slow it is. This is because people are doing it.

The list in the bottom is a list of websites that are attacked. It also shows how many times it fails to load (higher is better) and how many times you requested to view the page.",1645806153.0,1645805922.0,t3_t17qjh,t3_t17qjh,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

The Russians attacked with three prongs yesterday: one attacking the North of Ukraine, through Belarus; the second striking east of the Dnieper; and third going through Crimea, and into Kherson. Yesterday, the first prong faced remarkable success, defeating a force of Ukrainians at Chernobyl and securing the town, nuclear power station, and its general surroundings. Bleeding into today, they advanced southward; there was a minor engagement at Ivankiv this morning, in which the Ukranians bombed bridges and generally skirmished to try to slow the Russian advance. At the present, the Russians seem to be advancing closer and closer to Kiev, and shelling its suburbs. The battle for Kiev will probably occur over the next few days, and it's going to be really ugly: street violence is expected, and Kiev will likely be a ruined ghost town by the end of next week.

On the Donbas front (attacked by the second prong) Ukrainian resistance has proven to be more effective. Yesterday, the Russians made an attack on the city of Sumy: street fighting ensued, but the Russians were repelled in the end and forced to retreat. A parallel, if less widely verified, victory was also attested at Staroblinsk today; with the Ukrainians claiming that a Russian contigent aiming to cross the adjacent Aidar river in order to attack the city was annihilated by them. It seems that this front has been mostly halted, for now.

On the third front, by Kherson, a decisive battle is drawing to a close. Yesterday, the Russians on Crimea advanced on the city of Kherson in order to seize a strategic bridge across the Dnieper: they faced initial stiff resistance, and so attacked the city of Nova Kakhova for its own, less robust, bridge over the Dnieper. Today, the Russians once again made an attack on Kherson, and after an initial struggle, took both the city and the bridge. The battle still seems to be raging, but the Russians seem to clearly have the upper hand.

These, of course, are only the offensives: through yesterday and today, cities all across Ukraine sustained bombing, and yesterday, Russian paratroopers seized an airport outside of Kiev, but were beaten back by the Ukrainians. So, overall, the Russians are generally winning, but probably by not as much as they'd like: the Ukrainians have made a stiff resistance, and halted one of their offensives. I don't see Ukraine winning this, unfortunately, but that's not due to a lacking of trying on their part.",False,1645806292.0,t3_t17qjh,t3_t17qjh,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

So Finland offers huge tactical benefit for both sides. For Russia it's easier to defend West flank when you control region so in case of invasion everything in South including Helsinki will be bombed to the ground because it's no use for them. So invading will be fast and huge amount of casualties and no intend to rebuild.

And inside of that new country, you had a lot of ""1st generation Californians"" who had just moved there and now live in a different country than their family and have lost their citizenship overnight, BUT that California is still relatively friendly.  Then 15ish years after California breaks off, they have a peaceful communist revolution and a new leader takes charge and starts becoming closer and closer to China and starts calling for California to enter the CSTO.  That's about as close of an analogy to Ukraine that I can give.

That's the reality that Putin is living in, whether that reality is actually correct or not.  For him, all that he cares about is power and Russian nationalism and security.  Sanctions, his soldier's deaths, a few protests here and there, and what he views as probably being a temporary pariah (after all, most of the world has already pretty much forgotten about the first time he invaded Ukraine in 2014) are all worth it to him if he can obtain his nationalistic dream.",False,1645810617.0,t3_t17qjh,t1_hye9g53,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

(All of them are more or less speculation by analysts, and the real truth might even be a mixture of all three, or there may be other crucial aspects missing)

1. He is making a calculated geopolitical move about not having to rely much anymore on the West economically because of stronger ties with China. This would open a long game with Russia-China as one cooperating bloc vs the western bloc. A century spanning confrontation and global realignment of geopolitics.

2. He expects (or expected) this to go quickly enough, and cleanly enough, that once done, he can still utilize his energy stranglehold over Europe to get back to something close to pre-war conditions, and over time the sanctions will mostly phase out (remember Nordstream 2 was approved in 2015, one year after Crimea, so he might be primed to think so). He would see the immediate costs to Russia as worth it to leave a legacy as the uniter of Historical Russia. 

3. Most worryingly, the third option is that the rumours about him having Parkinsons or other debilitating and/or terminal illness are true, and that he is seriously medicated with things like cortisone/steroids, testosterone, opiates, amphetamine-like medications etc. and that is really, truly in an altered and deteriorating mental state. Also possibly under enormous mental stress and anguish over facing his own mortality. And that his yes-men and creatures cannot stand up to him after two decades of consolidating power.

SWIFT is not a silver bullet and for better or worse, Russia is actually in a much better position to weather it than many other countries because they are not nearly as inter-connected to the rest of the world as other countries.

It's not going to stop Russia from its course in the short-term, and its debatable if it'll really stop long-term goals as well. It could also have a lot of unintended consequences that would impact non-Russia; exports of key commodities such as gas, wheat and other raw materials would be impacted. And it would further push Russia and China together, potentially further reshaping the east geo-political space.

And there is the big question of if SWIFT access is even that big of a deal; SWIFT cut ties to Iran back in 2018 and it didn't really have much of an impact on the country. Cutting SWIFT ties just means countries get a bit more creative in moving money around.

* The one key sector of their economy, petroleum, will become less and less relevant over time with renewables.
* Russia is less and less relevant as a cultural force.
* Diplomatically, their past misdeeds have left them increasingly marginalized and irrelevant.
Going after Ukraine probably doesn't reverse that, but is arguably one of the best ways to try and keep relevance. That is, when all of your moves remaining are bad moves, one might as well make the move that has at least a chance of winning if your opponents screw up.

&#x200B;

I think his plan was/is to hit Ukraine quickly, with enough strength to catch them off guard. Take the capital, replace the government, and force them to sign a peace treaty on Russia's terms. Along the lines of: No joining NATO ever, and Crimea is recognized as Russian.

&#x200B;

Then Russian troops leave. If it works, Russia will have (kind of?) legitimized Russia's claim over Crimea, they will have drastically set back Ukraine's ability to defend themselves, and there will (for awhile at least) be a puppet government favorable to Russia, that agrees to withdraw NATO application.

&#x200B;

If the war ends that way, and does so quickly, Putin may expect the peace treaty and withdrawal of troops to be enough to roll back some of the more severe sanctions.

&#x200B;

Putin may have underestimated Ukraine, and overestimated his troops... but, as is the Russian way, he has numbers on his side. They can just keep pushing.

&#x200B;

I doubt he really has a plan for what to do if foreign troops were to be deployed to Ukraine (which would have to happen pretty soon to make a real difference). The nuclear deterrent is a strong one. I imagine he would try to get China on his side to declare war on whosever troops deployed to Ukraine to fight the Russians.

Russian and Belarussian vehicles have IFF markers on them, these are in the form of a white Z, V or O, additionally some Russian vehicles have diagonal white stripes on them.

If you see a T72 variant, T80 variant, GAZ Tigr, BMP3, BMD3 or BM30 Smerch, it's Russian, Ukraine doesn't field these. 

Russian vehicles typically have a darker green camo than Ukranian ones.

Russian Infantry is using the EMR Flora pattern camoflauge which is a darker green - they've also been spotted wearing white bands around their arm or leg, Ukranian troops are a lighter more beige colour, in the past some Ukranian troops have also been seen to use scrim covers on their helmets which Russia almost never does. If you can see closer up shots of rifles, Russia will have AK74Ms with black furniture, Ukraine mostly fields the AK74 which will have wooden furniture or a triangle wire like stock for the folding AKS72 variant. Similar story with the black and wooden furniture for Dragunov designated marksman rifles and PKM medium machine guns.

If you see any infantry with AK12s (similar to an AK74 but has lots of rails and shit) then these troops are definitely Russian VDV. If you see any other weapons like the AS VAL, PP19 Bizon it's Russian. 

Any infantry holding NLAW or Javelin ATGM systems are Ukranian.

Germany is scared because they depend on gas and coal from Russia. They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

Germany is scared because they depend on gas and coal from Russia. They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

Nuclear missiles (as opposed to bombs such as the ones dropped over Japan in WWII) are intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which means that they are capable of traveling intercontinental distances by following a ballistic trajectory.

In other words, they fire off into space like a traditional rocket, travel parabolically up to 2,000 km above ground (space starts at 100 km), and fall down at hypersonic speeds toward their target.

It is incredibly challenging to track ICBMs in space, especially as they jettison stages and decoys along the way, and guide a surface-to-air interceptor quickly and accurately enough that it can detonate the ICBM midcourse.

Germany is scared because they depend on gas and coal from Russia. They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

If he isn't crazy enough to use Nukes, then it is unlikely that he ever will because of MAD....so in that case we should all jump in now.

Either way, it feels like the world should do something now.  Either way it won't matter if he is crazy enough to use nukes because that will happen eventually.  Why wait for more innocents to die before getting involved?

Saddam Hussein was a brutal dictator. The US had just been attacked, at home, unprovoked. US needed a response and was misled into believing that WMDs were in Iraq. I honestly think the US president was not being given 100% accurate information and based his decision, as he describes in his book, on bad intel and Saddam's attitude towards the UN nuclear investigators. I really do think the principal reason for invasion was the perceived threat from Iraq as being a nuclear state with anti-american sentiment, just after an invisible enemy had attacked them at home.

Again, not defending but I honestly don't think the US just wanted to bomb Iraq for fun or money.

Russia is acting against a democratically elected, European state that simply wishes to be independent. Russia fears the expansion of NATO.

US intelligence corroborated the claim, and Iraq simply was not a popular country to the world. Dictators have a harder time gaining popular opinion than democracies, to be frank. There are undoubtedly parallels, but it also cannot be said that Saddam Hussein was kind to his own people and the US took on the similar stance of liberators to Iraqis and Afghans, which, after the Korean war maybe we thought we could turn the middle east into something similar, idk.

Morale is low honestly. Look at all those photos even in western media of the recruitment centers. The men look completely dejected. I get it, the odds are tough, and Ukraine wasn't that rich of a country to begin with. They just parted ways with their family and know that if the fighting goes on this could be basically a death sentence. It's so sad seeing some of these photos and I'm not just talking about the casualties or burned homes. I actually think some of the photos of expressionless looking men lined up are the most chilling. The silence is what rips through your hearts as you can tell they feel completely helpless.

Ukraine is doing everything it can to help its people and I think this cannot be emphasized any more. Zelensky is an aboslute hero and there's some discussion in armchair generals' circles that the ghost of Kyiv might actually just be a fake used to give the people a hero to cheer after (the odds of that much success from a single pilot knowing the air assets both countries has is extremely low). But I fear all of this is just not enough. They're doing everything they can, but Russian firepower is just too overwhelming.

On the other hand I can't help think but these columns of tanks would get completely shredded in actual warfare with NATO (think Highway of Death from Gulf War 1).

Both countries have, historically, been fucked over by such alliances in general. 

Russia is also hyper aggressive towards some of these nations entertaining the thought of joining NATO as we are witnessing in Ukraine.

&#x200B;

Some member states, France in particular, have a particular penchant for unilaterally blocking ascension. France blocked both Ukraine and Georgia last time, and also prevented a NATO alliance with both Japan and Australia (that is to say, they would not be members but would merely cooperate. France didn't want that.).

&#x200B;

Plus, remaining ""neutral"" or walking a both sides of the fence has been good enough. The US had contained Russia very well. Neoliberalism is falling apart, though, and Russia has been invading conservative political parties set on weakening or leave NATO. 

&#x200B;

It turns out that going it alone is a bad idea on the world stage unless you are a global power. And, even then, it is going to be rough. If Ukraine is a ""fake"" created state then Finland is as well which of course does not bode well for them.

&#x200B;

Germany is scared because they depend on gas and coal from Russia. They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

Germany is scared because they depend on gas and coal from Russia. They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

So no, Merkel is actually the reason we are in this mess in the first place. Stop spouting bullshit when you have no clue what you are talking about.",False,1645808219.0,t3_t17qjh,t1_hyeejn1,,2,-2,0,-2,0,0,

They are scared that by crippling Russia, they cripple themselves and are unable to provide for their people. As a German, I think it's dreadful that we rely on a nation like Russia to fulfil our energy requirements. Nonetheless, I would love for us to just hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions. However, that won't happen unless we figure out a way to get the energy we require elsewhere. Until then, Russia has the German government by the balls.

All that is a result of Merkel's government dragging its feet for 16 years and Schr√∂der fucking around with Russia before. They did half of what the people asked when getting rid of nuclear power, but completely neglected to do the other half of what people wanted - invest heavily into renewable energy. Instead they were paid handsomely by the coal lobby to keep those power plants running, and neglected the energy switch. Then, when it became apparent that people were pissed due to the climate crisis, they quickly decided to get rid of coal as well. They slowed any change to renewable energy and just bought the gas they needed from Russia, placing the current government in this no-win situation. Either they hit Russia with the hardest possible sanctions and almost certainly lose the ability to fulfil German energy requirements, or they look bad internationally and let Russia get away with it. Seeing as they were elected by the German people, they decided to fulfil their needs first, a decision I understand but don't agree with.

In any case, this is not Scholz' fault. He is backed into a corner and can't win here. If you want to blame someone, blame Merkel and Schr√∂der.

Little do you think of the peaceful people on earth who simply want to live on and make for a brighter future in different ways. 

Where‚Äôs the nuance in your comment? Where is the empathy for men who have families they love more than anything and would rather seek refuge with them in the face of a massive military in comparison to your own? 

‚ÄúMen‚Äù don‚Äôt need to exhibit the sort of bravery you‚Äôre pushing. There are other definitions of bravery, and sometimes that means to defy mandates or drafts and forge your own path. 

Wars are waged because people put borders around themselves. Us and Them. Because people only think of money, of power. Of nationalism. 

Not everyone subscribed to this way of life. Any Ukrainian man leaving now is just as brave as those who are choosing to stay and fight.

They are both dictatorships with a shared goal of making the world less democratic. The less democratic everywhere else on Earth becomes, the safer their dictatorship authority will be.

The only reason China's upset with Putin is that it will hasten America's re-armament for a global conflict. China's been saber-rattling a lot but they have been more conservative than Russia. They have several key America specialist policy advisers in Xi's inner circle whose only job is to determine when it is safe to ramp up nationalistic rhetoric and when it is going too far and making American voters nervous. They have been playing this dance now for 15 years.

So yes, Russia's moves in Ukraine upset that delicate dance, but China's rapidly approaching a moment where it won't matter how upset America gets and they can safely take Taiwan. It's a question of when, not if, China defeats America's Se Asia naval power and secures Taiwan. It may happen two years from now or it may happen ten years from now, but it will happen, and China will be the victor in this show-down because they will be the ones who choose when they want it to happen, on their terms.

Putin's destabilization efforts will help China accomplish this goal in the long-term. They sow distrust among American and Taiwanese allies and they normalize the international expectation of hopelessness and inevitability. The world will be less shocked with China capturing Taiwan if Russia captures Ukraine. It is very similar, foreign policy wise, to the defensive alliance between Japan and Germany in WW2.

Its been one day, but the 1st day was definitely bad for Russia by any stretch of the imagination. Russia is on its way to losing more troops and equipment in one week than the USA did across the entire fucking Iraq war (2003, the more difficult Iraq war) at this rate.

------

Russia is advancing at an incredibly rapid rate, leaving themselves vulnerable to counter-attack. Putin is rushing things. On the one hand, Russia might reach Kyiv sooner and actually execute their ""Decapitation"" strategy. They really are gunning for it and pushing way harder than US-troops did into Iraq.

On the other hand, Russian losses due to this rapid advance cannot be understated.

Russia almost certainly will execute their ""decapitation"" strategy at this rate, pushing into Kyiv and possibly capturing Ukrainian leaders. They're spending significant amounts of resources and dying for this goal. Ukrainians are doing their best to make it as painful as possible.

I don't think this ""decapitation"" idea is a good idea though. That will only piss off the Ukrainians even more. Its clear that the Russians are trying though...

--------

That's the thing. Russia probably will execute their military goals. They're clearly willing to spend all of these lives and equipment on this goal. But what then?

A slower-advance from Russia arguably would be better for Russia (fewer troops lost, more careful advancement). But Russia is rushing because Ukrainian support grows day-by-day. Russia feels the need to ""cut-off the head"" and hope for a quick victory. The strategy doesn't make sense because the entire situation doesn't make sense... but what else can Russia hope for right now? If they slow down, that only risks more Ukrainian aid coming in... and gives more time for the Ukrainian population to arm themselves and organize an insurrection.
