Western disinformation campaign about alleged preparation of Russian attack on Ukraine.

Since the end of 2021, the international information space has been confronted with an unprecedented media campaign aimed at convincing the world community that Russia is preparing an attack on Ukraine.

Numerous mass media outlets spread blatant disinformation and engage in manipulation to impose the thesis of Moscow's ""aggressive intentions"" on the public. They ignore the fact that Russia has repeatedly declared its support for a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis on the basis of the Minsk Agreement, referred to the sovereign right of states to deploy troops on their own territory, and emphasized the defensive nature of the joint exercises with the Belarusian armed forces.  
\---

No explanation required, I guess.

Liars gonna lie... and there are still people believing 'negotiations' are even possible and will bring peace.

* However, organised Ukrainian defence continues in the area. The tactical Russian advance to the south of the town has likely made little progress.
* In the north, in Kremina-Svatove sector of Luhansk Oblast, Russian forces are making continuous offensive efforts, though each local attack remains on too small a scale to achieve a significant breakthrough.
* Russia likely aims to reverse some of the gains Ukrainian forces made over September-November 2022: there is a realistic possibility that their immediate goal is to advance west to the Zherberets River.

1. [https://hub.conflictobservatory.org/portal/apps/sites/#/home/pages/children-camps-1](https://hub.conflictobservatory.org/portal/apps/sites/#/home/pages/children-camps-1)  Yale HRL has collected information about at least 6,000 children from Ukraine ages four months to 17 years who have been held at (Russian) camps and other facilities since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Arrivals to these facilities began in February 2022; the most recent transfers occurred in January 2023. The total number of children is not known and is likely significantly higher than 6,000. 

2.  At least 43 facilities in network: The network spans at least 43 facilities identified by Yale HRL, 41 of which are pre-existing summer camps in Russia-occupied Crimea and Russia. Among the camps, 12 are clustered around the Black Sea, 7 are in occupied Crimea, and 10 are clustered around the cities of Moscow, Kazan, and Yekaterinburg. Eleven of the camps are located over 500 miles from Ukraine’s border with Russia, including two camps in Siberia and one in Russia’s Far East. The exact number of facilities is likely significantly higher than the 43 identified in this report. Yale HRL identified two facilities associated with the deportation of orphans: a psychiatric hospital, and a family center. 

3.  Network of children’s facilities stretches from Russia-occupied Crimea to Russia’s eastern coast: The furthest camp this investigation identifies is in Magadan oblast in Russia’s Far East near the Pacific Ocean, approximately 3,900 miles from Ukraine’s border with the Russian Federation. The camp in Magadan is roughly three times closer to the United States than it is to the border of Ukraine.

 4.  Primary purpose of the camps appears to be political re-education: At least 32 (78%) of the camps identified by Yale HRL appear engaged in systematic re-education efforts that expose children from Ukraine to Russia-centric academic, cultural, patriotic, and/or military education. Multiple camps endorsed by the Russian Federation are advertised as “integration programs”, with the apparent goal of integrating children from Ukraine into the Russian government’s vision of national culture, history, and society. 

5.  Children from two of the camps have been placed with foster families in Russia: Yale HRL identified at least two camps that hosted children alleged to be orphans who were later placed with foster families in Russia. Twenty children from these camps were reported to have been placed with families in Moscow oblast and enrolled in local schools there.

 6.  Consent is collected under duress and routinely violated: Consent gathered from parents for their child to attend a camp included signing over power of attorney in some cases, including to an unnamed agent. Other parents allege that the specific elements of the consent they gave were violated, such as the term of stay and procedures for reuniting with their children. Still other parents allegedly refused to allow their children to go to camps, but were ignored by camp organizers who enrolled the children in camps regardless. In many cases, the ability of parents to provide meaningful consent may be considered doubtful, as the conditions of war and implicit threat from occupying forces represent conditions of duress. 

7.  Children’s returns from at least four camps have been suspended: In approximately 10% of camps identified by Yale HRL, children’s return to Ukraine was allegedly suspended. At two camps, Artek and Medvezhonok, children’s returns were suspended indefinitely, according to parents. Medvezhonok is one of the largest camps identified, at one point hosting at least 300 children from Ukraine. Officials there originally told the children’s parents they would return at the end of summer, but later rescinded the date of return. Hundreds of children from Ukraine from at least two other camps, Luchistyi and Orlyonok, have been or are being held past their scheduled date of return; Yale HRL has been unable to identify how many of these children have been reunited with their parents. Parents also described being unable to get information about their child’s status or whereabouts after their return has been suspended. It is unknown how many of Ukraine’s children Russia currently holds and how many have been released to their families. 

8.  All levels of Russia’s government are involved: This operation is centrally coordinated by Russia’s federal government and involves every level of government. Yale HRL has identified several dozen federal, regional, and local figures directly engaged in operating and politically justifying the program. Activities of officials allegedly implicated in the operation include logistical coordination (i.e., transporting children), raising funds, collecting supplies, direct camp management, and promoting the program within Russia and occupied areas of Ukraine. At least 12 of these individuals are not on U.S. and/or international sanction lists at the time of this report.",1676403498.0,1676403342.0,t3_111t9si,t3_111t9si,,0,70,0,70,0,0,

Day 355-356 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were actually very quiet, as there were no missile strikes. The loudest thing that happened in Kharkiv was that some idiot fired fireworks in one of the districts during this evening. Of course, there are still a lot of air raid alerts going off every day, but most of them thankfully end up being uneventful.

Some recon drones, or possibly even balloons, were spotted again in our airspace. At first people thought that those were Shaheds, but very soon after our air force confirmed that they weren’t Shaheds. We still don’t exactly understand what those are, but it’s weird that they only started using them now.

The news about more air defense coming from this Ramstein are just great, it seems we will be getting more of the Iris-T systems very soon, as well as SAMP-T, and possibly even Patriot. Though it might still take a bit more time for Patriot. The news about more air defense is honestly one of the best ones so far from this meeting, especially since the wait for them won’t be too long now, and it will definitely help us greatly in defending our infrastructure from missile strikes.",False,1676423969.0,t3_111t9si,t3_111t9si,,0,90,0,90,0,0,

\- There are serbian ""volunteers"" who should take part in violence, also russians from Transnistria and some Gagauz paramilitary. There are also FSB agents in the country. They are known.

\- They will try to use those mercenaries to occupy government buildings (similar to Crimea)

\- They will try to lock down multiple cities (block access)

**- They will try to occupy the airport to maybe bring in more forces.**

Yesterday the very same Su-24, RF-93799 Blue 45, reportedly caught a Ukrainian MANPADs somewhere over Bakhmut. Prigozhin's PR immediately said ""it was a miracle, the pilot managed to land the plane, everyone survived"".

> After two tours of duty as a sniper with Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Chechnya Antonin returned to civilian life and raised a son who also completed his tour in the army. Antonin was then mobilized as a sergeant in the reserves.

> Despite not being an officer he immediately used his huge personal authority to de-facto lead the entire mobik regiment. Despite many difficulties he helped his commanders organize the competent training for his personnel, earning a promotion to squad leader.

> His comrades say that after leading his unit to a mass attack by enemy tanks and mortar, Antonin did not lose heart and began to organize casevac under fire. He personally carried three heavily wounded to safety, and when going for the fourth he received a direct hit by an enemy shell.

> His body was only repatriated yesterday, by another 'maroon beret' who served with him earlier. Reportedly, Tikhonov's own maroon beret was close to his heart when he died. 

So, to summarize: Russians mobilized a police sniper 20 years after he had last served. He found complete chaos at the tent camp, and ended up being the only one willing to train his mobiks.

> Today there is some good news. The Russians continued prioritizing their least successful direction and throwing their best forces in an attempt to capture Vuhledar. Despite successfully rebuffing previous Russian attacks, the Ukrainians have found an even easier way to destroy Russian attackers because today it was reported that they eliminated a Russian commander in charge of the assault units with a precision strike, which allowed them to destroy the disorganized troops on the ground much faster. 

> Last time I told you that the Russians attempted to penetrate the front line west of Vuhledar in order to create a bulge, stretch Ukrainian reserves, and diminish the supply and support of Vuhledar. As you remember, the Ukrainians met the attackers with fire and prevented them from establishing control over the hills. But as it turned out, the Ukrainians did not stop there. Today a Russian commander of the forces located in this region reported that the Ukrainians immediately launched a counterattack. Some sources indicate that as a result of this counterattack, the Ukrainians have pushed the Russians back to their initial positions across the river. After that, some Russian sources said that several Ukrainian groups were spotted between Prechystivka and Pavlivka, they concluded that the Ukrainians were preparing to further penetrate Russian defenses and that the Russians prudently scared them off with artillery. However, today’s reports about a successful Ukrainian precision strike on the Russian command post of the East battalion strongly indicates that the Ukrainians were not planning an attack, they were just sending reconnaissance groups into the Russian territory. 

> While the Ukrainians were conducting this reconnaissance mission, the Russians launched yet another assault in the direction of the hamlet east of Vuhledar. But because the Ukrainian HIMARS strike on the Russian headquarters killed the headquarters commander, the coordination of Russian forces was undermined, and the Ukrainians quickly repelled the Russian attack. Another Russian commander said that this was a smart move on the part of the Ukrainians because if you destroy the army headquarters – the battle will continue, but if you destroy the battalion headquarters – the battle will quickly die out because battalion headquarters are most involved in the process of managing and collecting and analyzing what is happening on the ground. All other headquarters build their understanding of the current situation mainly from battalion-level reports. He added that they were ready for such developments and had prepared alternative ways, but, as many speculate, this was likely added to avoid problems with the higher command. The most recent updates indicate that the Russians became quieter, which suggests that their further attacks were either put on hold or canceled.

> This is not the first commander that the Russians have lost here. Around a week ago, in one of the disastrous Russian attacks, the Russians also lost a colonel who was in charge of the whole brigade. The fact the Russians continue committing significant amounts of resources to the Vuhledar area despite high losses clearly signals that taking Vuhledar is imperative for achieving broader goals. Furthermore, recently published geolocated footage showed the aftermath of a Russian thermobaric artillery strike near Vuhledar. As noted by the Institute for the Study of War, thermobaric artillery systems are military district-level assets, which suggests that Russian forces put a high priority on Vuhledar.",False,1676415818.0,t3_111t9si,t3_111t9si,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Regarding one of his battles in Bakhmut:

> It happened on the outskirts. Our task at that time was to prevent the enemy from entering the territory of ‘the farm’, where Ukrainian border guards were stationed. The first battle with the Russians started during our reconnaissance. It turned out like this: I asked the soldier who was on my way for the password. Nothing. We looked at each other for a few seconds. In the end, they realized that we were enemies and started shooting. There were several Russians. I managed to shoot one . . .

On how high the casualties for the UA is in Bakhmut:

> in the section Bakhmut-to-Soledar direction, it may happen that out of every 10 fighters, 7-8 people will be wounded in their first battle. 

On the dead bodies:

> How fierce the fighting is in that area can be judged from the following facts: when we entered the forest strips, we saw that the ground there was literally mixed with corpses and tree fragments (this is the result of massive artillery and tank fire). And you can't distinguish which of these dead are Russians and which are Ukrainians. It is difficult to convey all this in words. Ukrainians evacuate their bodies whenever possible, but Russians do not. The heat will come, a terrible smell will hang over those forest strips.

Some of the locals are pro-russia 

> I think that most people perceive the events there as well. There are now very few locals left (about 700 in Bakhmut) - mostly old people and those who have nowhere to go, and they did not dare to leave their home. It is clear that someone among them is waiting for the Russians. Here is a specific story: as the commander of the group, I was told over the radio that they saw a local resident in a knitted hat, who was leading some two people in military uniform without weapons into the house. I then went up to the fifth floor of the building. Perhaps you remember the well-known photo showing several five-story buildings in Bakhmut that were destroyed by Russian tanks. That's how we were there - we helped the paratroopers hold positions in those houses. So, I look from the 5th floor and see that the uncle in the knitted cap brings 2 Russian soldiers to his place, and then goes to us with a canister of water. At night, he tried to lead those Russians to the house closest to us. I ordered to open fire.

Regarding their food bag:

> If alone, then carry a small gas canister, also a metal mug to boil water. By the way, in Canadian dry rations, there is a special chemical heater in the pack—throw it in the food, and after a couple of minutes it is warm.

My uncle in Houston hosted a watch party, and everyone there was rooting for Foreman. I was rooting for Ali because I thought that he was hilarious and charming.



For seven rounds, Ali was ‘losing’. Foreman was bigger, stronger, and his punches were ferocious. But Ali was smarter, faster, had better conditioning, and was executing a plan.


In the eighth round, the tide turned, and in two short minutes Ali got the knock-out. Later, the term ‘rope-a-dope’ was coined to describe how Muhammad Ali had defeated George Foreman that day.

Western intelligence indicates that Moscow is amassing fixed-wing and rotary aircraft near Russia’s border with Ukraine, two officials privy to the information told Financial Times.

“The Russian land forces are pretty depleted so it’s the best indication that they will turn this into an air fight,” one of the officials said. “If the Ukrainians are going to survive… they need to have as many air defense capabilities and as much ammunition… as possible.”

In addition to the **German commitment to supply 14 Leopard 2A6** main battle tanks, **only Portugal has announced that it will provide three** such tanks. Pistorius said that further A6s are not currently under discussion. **In the case of ""Leopard 2A4"" tanks from Poland, he said, there may be problems regarding the condition and operational capability of the tanks.**

>**Asked if he had any sympathy for countries that had first pushed insanely to deliver tanks and were now having delivery problems, Pistorius said, ""Since I'm in the diplomatic arena here, I would say little.""** According to Pistorius, the question of how to ensure that sufficient ammunition and spare parts are available is also still open. ""That cannot be ensured by the Federal Republic of Germany, only the arms companies can do that,"" he said.

NATO is a hostile organization that is increasingly interfering in Ukraine. The Kremlin said this on the day that defense ministers hold talks about Ukraine in Brussels. Discussions are taking place, among other things, about ammunition that will be delivered to Kiev.

""NATO is doing its best to make its involvement in the Ukraine conflict as clear as possible,"" the Kremlin said. According to Russia, the arms deliveries from NATO members contribute to the protraction of the conflict and increase the chance of escalation.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg today stressed the importance of Finland and Sweden joining the alliance as soon as possible and that speed is more important than processing the applications simultaneously.

Fortunately, the offensive has been delayed for so long we now have very good ideas on where they are wanting to come from and what they want to achieve. The past several days, the situation has become clear and Ukraine is now busy building extensive defensive lines and fortifications along the likely axes of advance. 

Russia still has a 4-5 week window of attack, if they choose to continue. Before they would get stuck in the mud. So every day now is critical. Every day, the Ukrainian defenders prevent Russia from manipulating the front line and setting Russia-favorable conditions for an offensive is a *huge win* for Ukraine. Every day is one less day of potential offensive operations, one more day to asymmetrically attrit/weaken the attacking Russian forces, and one more day to build defensive fortifications. 

These skirmishes in adjacent forests may not seem like a big deal. Seeing Ukraine on the defense is not as satisfying as watching them sweep across open fields in giant combined arms operations. But just know the defensive operation being conducted by Ukraine right now is working. It is withering, disabling, and throwing all of Russia's plans into disarray. Every day Russia stays their main hand, it is that much less likely to succeed now. So every day of no news moving forward is essentially big news. And if/when Russia decides to finally blow its load, they may now be in for a nasty surprise.

656789fa9edaf871997326a928bf6d8e,111t9si,j8jhvym,">	As the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears, U.S. officials are telling Ukrainian leaders they face a critical moment to change the trajectory of the war, raising the pressure on Kyiv to make significant gains on the battlefield while weapons and aid from the United States and its allies are surging.
    Despite promises to back Ukraine “as long as it takes,” Biden officials say recent aid packages from Congress and America’s allies represent Kyiv’s best chance to decisively change the course of the war. Many conservatives in the Republican-led House have vowed to pull back support, and Europe’s long-term appetite for funding the war effort remains unclear.
Several officials noted the strong bipartisan support that has accompanied every Ukraine package, adding that Congress gave the White House more than it asked for, but they acknowledged that was under a Democrat-led House and Senate.
“We will continue to try to impress upon them that we can’t do anything and everything forever,” said one senior administration official, referring to Ukraine’s leaders. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, added that it was the administration’s “very strong view” that it will be hard to keep getting the same level of security and economic assistance from Congress.
“'As long as it takes’ pertains to the amount of conflict,” the official added. “It doesn’t pertain to the amount of assistance.”
The war in recent months has become a slow grind in eastern Ukraine, with neither side gaining the upper hand. Biden officials believe the critical juncture will come this spring, when Russia is expected to launch an offensive and Ukraine mounts a counteroffensive in an effort to reclaim lost territory.
Underlining the importance of the moment for the administration, Vice President Harris, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are heading to a major security summit in Germany this week and President Biden is traveling to Poland next week for a speech and meetings on the first anniversary.
The Biden administration is also working with Congress to approve another $10 billion in direct budget assistance to Kyiv and is expected to announce another large military assistance package in the next week and the imposition of more sanctions on the Kremlin around the same time.
Harris navigates the 2022 Munich security conference
The critical nature of the next few months has already been conveyed to Kyiv in blunt terms by top Biden officials — including deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman and undersecretary of defense Colin Kahl, all of whom visited Ukraine last month.
CIA Director William J. Burns traveled to the country one week ahead of those officials, where he briefed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on his expectations for what Russia is planning militarily in the coming months and emphasized the urgency of the moment.
At the same time, Biden and his aides are eager to avoid any sign of defection or weakening resolve by Western allies ahead of the Feb. 24 anniversary, hoping to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that support for Ukraine is not waning.
But some analysts warned that neither Russia nor Ukraine is likely to seize a decisive military advantage in the foreseeable future.
“It feels like we are playing for a long war,” said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. “I think it’s at odds with what so many people would hope for, that we’re actually trying to help Ukraine win militarily.”
She added, “It feels like a moment of really high uncertainty.”
Biden and his top aides say they are determined to back Ukraine as long and as fully as possible. But they warn that the political path will get tougher once Ukraine has exhausted the current congressional package, which could happen as early as this summer.
Some Western leaders have harbored reservations about sending certain types of heavy weaponry to Ukraine, worried about a direct confrontation with Russia, especially after Putin signaled a willingness to use nuclear weapons.
Analysis: How to decode Putin's nuclear warnings
But loud public lobbying by Zelensky, followed by quiet behind-the-scenes dealmaking by U.S. officials, has changed the dynamic. Biden and Blinken spent much of December and January working to convince allies to help provide Ukraine with the tanks and missiles that his administration had resisted sending for months.
Biden aides encouraged the Netherlands, for example, to help the United States provide critical air defense systems. On Dec. 20, officials at the National Security Council met with senior Dutch officials and stressed the importance the United States was placing on air defense, according to a senior administration official familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of private discussions.
What the officials did not know was that the United States was working to bring Zelensky to Washington the next day, where Biden would announce that he was approving a Patriot Missile battery, Zelensky’s top request to help defend against Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure.
The battery needed a launcher — ideally one already in Europe — so Dutch officials worked through the holidays to see how they could assist the United States, the official said. In January, Biden invited the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, to visit the White House, and the Dutch came up with a solution. When Rutte visited on Jan. 17, he said the Netherlands would provide two Patriot Missile launchers and missiles to Ukraine.
But Biden faced challenges on other fronts as well. While Britain had announced it would supply tanks to Ukraine, Germany refused to send its own Leopard 2 tanks or to authorize other countries to transfer their own Leopards — unless the United States agreed to send its prized M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine.
For much of January, Pentagon and White House officials insisted the M1 Abrams tanks were not well-suited for Ukrainian troops because they are so complicated to operate and maintain. But Biden wanted to avoid the appearance of a fissure in the Western alliance.
In late January, Biden’s Cabinet came up with a plan for the United States to announce the provision of M1 Abrams tanks, which would placate Germany even though the U.S. tanks would not arrive for several months at the earliest. The following the day, Biden gave the go-ahead.
Now, as the United States prepares to send 31 of the premier tanks in the medium term, Europe is quickly assembling two Leopard tank battalions in the near term — the equivalent of at least 70 tanks — in a move that could significantly shift the balance of power on the battlefield.
Yet the public show of unity belies underlying tensions over how Ukraine should focus its resources in the coming months.
The frank discussions in Kyiv last month reflected an effort by the Biden administration to bring Ukraine’s goals in line with what the West can sustain as the war approaches its one-year mark.

On the subject of Ukrainian children, in an episode of StarTalk Neil deGrasse Tyson interviewed [Irwin Redlene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Redlener) who is a co-founder of [Ukraine Children’s Action Project](https://www.eifoundation.org/partners/ukraine-childrens-action-project/) as well as a pediatrician.

From the blurb:  
>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener.  

More from the blurb:  
>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children. We discuss the current state of humanitarian aid. Is there more we can be doing to help victims of war beyond satisfying immediate needs? What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict? 

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up.

Before leopards 2A4 were to be modernized to version 2PL they had to be fixed up to great shape, which is where problems started, the parts that were coming from Germany company were coming at very low rate, Polish company modernizing tanks had to wait weeks and sometimes even months for parts from Germany company to come.

There were cases when the division, starting the battle, had 6-7 thousand bayonets, and at the end of the operation its losses amounted to 10-12 thousand - due to constant replenishment! And there were never enough people! The operational map of Pogostya is strewn with unit numbers, but there are no soldiers in them. But the colonel carries out the order and drives people to the attack. If his soul hurts and has a conscience, he himself participates in the battle and dies. There is a kind of natural selection. The faint of heart and the sensitive do not survive. There remain cruel, strong personalities capable of fighting under the prevailing conditions. They know only one method of war - to crush the enemy using mass of bodies. Someone will kill the German. And slowly but surely, the regular German divisions are melting away.
>Its good, if the colonel tries to think over and prepare an attack, to see if everything possible has been done. And often he is simply mediocre, lazy, drunk. Often he does not want to leave the warm shelter and crawl under the bullets ... Often the artillery officer did not identify the targets enough, and, in order not to risk it, shoots from afar at the squares, well, if not at his own, although this happened quite often ... It happens that the supply man got drunk and had fun with the women in the nearest village, but the shells and food were not delivered ... Or the major went astray and led his battalion by compass to the wrong place at all ... Confusion, confusion, imperfections, fraud, failure to fulfill duty, so characteristic of us in civilian life, in war are manifested brighter than anywhere else. And for all one payment - blood. Ivans go on the attack and die, and the one sitting in the shelter drives and drives them.

Lenin was a bad dude for sure. Not shy about concentration camps or summary executions. But nothing on the level of Soviet gulags and mass purges of the Stalin era.

I’d also point out that I don’t want to conflate Lenin with Stalin or the Soviet system that followed.

That will not be decided by negotiation, but by battle. The real issue centers around Crimea and the land bridge there, it would seem. For Ukraine to accept any settlement that keeps the land bridge intact, would be a huge loss, as it would include losing Mariupol and losing enormous swathes of their previous coast line, including all their ports in the Sea of Azov.

For Russia on the other hand, having Crimea without the land bridge seems a non-starter as well. Even if a negotiated settlement would include delivery of power and water from the Ukrainian mainland, it seems incredibly unlikely that the Ukrainians would honour such an agreement a few years down the road. 

Additionally losing Crimea outright would be disastrous to the Putin regime. Frankly, as much has been made of Donetsk and Luhansk, the capture of Crimea was wildly popular in Russia and was seen as righting a historical wrong. If Putin's war ends up *losing* the *one* thing of worth Russia captured in this entire affair, that would certainly be a huge defeat for the Russian collective ego.
