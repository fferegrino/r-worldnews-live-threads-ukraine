And Russia plans to build dozens more prisons, according to a government document obtained by The Associated Press.

>The AP spoke with dozens of people, including 20 former detainees, along with ex-prisoners of war, the families of more than a dozen civilians in detention, two Ukrainian intelligence officials and a government negotiator. Their accounts, as well as satellite imagery, social media, government documents and copies of letters delivered by the Red Cross, confirm a widescale Russian system of detention and abuse of civilians that goes directly against the Geneva Conventions.

> … the south: The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation and z-bloggers last week repeatedly reported about a destruction of the UA bridgehead near the Antonovsky bridge in the Kherson region; but at the beginning of this week, the bridgehead remained intact, even expanding, and **it is not even the only bridgehead** (we wrote about this several times) but Russian armored groups and the few infantry positioned by the river moved back from the Dnieper. 

> In the Zaporozhye region, **the endless [Ukrainian] assaults on hundreds of Russian strongholds were replaced by powerful artillery and missile strikes by Ukrainian forces**. Ukraine hit RF artillery and air defense systems. According to our sources in the Russian headquarters, artillery, MLRS, and air defense are regularly deployed to the south, but [**Russian] equipment losses begin to exceed replenishments**. 

> A similar situation has developed with the [Russian] infantry. The appeal of the former commander of the 58th Army of the RF Armed Forces Ivan Popov, published on July 12—where he speaks of heavy personnel losses, the lack of rotation and the tension of forces in the south, and confirms the effectiveness of Ukrainian artillery—Popov speaks directly about the heavy losses in Russian units from the shelling of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The **lack of rotation** in the RF Armed Forces is due to what we talked about last week—they try to **not send large units** of infantry, airborne troops, and marines **to the south; consequently, the motorized riflemen sent earlier** (mostly from the mobilized ones) **suffered heavy losses and there is almost no one to replace** the troops on the front line. [combined arms]

> However, the Russian defense is still holding out. Not least because, in recent days, the Armed Forces of **Ukraine have abandoned direct offensive operations, focusing on knocking out guns and anti-aircraft missile systems**. If the **change of tactics yields results and deprives the Russian Armed Forces of artillery support and protection from air attacks, then by the end of July, it will be a serious test of the strength of Russian defense**. 

> Until now, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have only had to bring less than 10 brigades to battle in the south. Reserves are intact. The Russians cannot boast of similar numbers—they put almost everything that they had into action—and from the 20th of June to the beginning of July, they continually transferred reinforcements from the east of Ukraine, from the Crimea, and the Rostov region [to the south].

> The East is a different story:  RF Armed Forces tried to go on the offensive. Targeting three areas, specifically: near Avdiivka, near Kremenna, and in the Svatove-Dvurechnaya area (Kupyansk direction). 

> Near Avdiivka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine withdrew from the positions that they had recaptured from the Russians, near Vodyane, Opytny and Spartak. Russian units were even able to briefly advance to the village of Lastochkino (west of Avdiivka), but later, were driven out of there. In the last two days, Ukraine is slowly regaining positions they lost over the past week. 

> Near Kremenna, the Russian Forces are trying to advance in the direction of Torsky.  As they say in the headquarters, this leads to big losses but nice paperwork because such reporting renders bonuses. [Russian] Platoons and companies advanced 2-3 km in the gray zone, but then retreat under Ukrainian artillery fire. Russian reports on successful assaults and lists for [bonuses] go to the group headquarters, who gets recognition. In reality, the Armed Forces of the **Russian Federation dont really have progress there.**

> In the north of the Luhansk region, the Russians transfer fresh units into battle daily—in the Svatove region and towards Dvurechna. Losses are replenished, but there is **no actual progress [by the Russians].**

> The Russian activity in the east facilitated the fate of the group in the south, according to staff officers. The Russian generals believed the Armed Forces of Ukraine would transfer reserves from the Zaporozhye region to the east. The belief didn’t pan out. Ukraine has enough reserves to repel Russian strikes in the East.  So yes, the Russian generals miscalculated, again.

> The only point in the east where the Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing is Bakhmut. The routes and exits out of the city are under fire control of the Ukrainian artillery. According to various estimates, between **2,300 to 3,100 Russian soldiers and officers are stuck in Bakhmut.** This is not an encirclement, yet, but it is extremely **problematic to supply those  groups or withdraw them from the city**.

A reminder that russians have been committing these crimes since they invaded Ukraine’s Crimea and Donbas in 2014:

>AUGUST 25 2015
>
>**Russia sends Ukrainian film-maker to labour camp**
>
>*Verdict is second against a foreign national in what critics liken to the Stalinist-era show trials*
>
>A Russian military court has sentenced Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian film director, to 20 years in a labour camp, the second verdict in less than a week against a foreign national dragged into what critics liken to the Stalinist-era show trials.
>
>The judge in the south-western city of Rostov-on-Don delivered the sentence after declaring Mr Sentsov and Alexander Kolchenko, a Ukrainian leftwing social activist, guilty of plotting to organise a terrorist group in Crimea. Mr Kolchenko received 10 years’ hard labour.
>
>The case follows last week’s sentencing of Eston Kohver, an Estonian security agent kidnapped by Russia’s FSB from his own country’s territory, to 15 years in prison on charges of espionage. Ukrainian fighter pilot Nadiya Savchenko, who had been fighting in eastern Ukraine, is also being tried in Rostov-on-Don for alleged murder after she was seized and brought to Russia.
>
>The trials are throwing a spotlight on what Russian legal professionals say is a reversion to the politicised trials and trumped-up evidence common under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin in the 1930s — something Russian defendants have been enduring for more than a decade.
>
>Criticising Tuesday’s verdict, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said: “Russian courts are not competent to judge acts committed outside the internationally recognised territory of Russia. The EU considers the case to be in breach of international law and elementary standards of justice. The EU continues to call on the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr Sentsov and Mr Kolchenko and to guarantee their safe return to Ukraine.”
>
>“This has nothing to do with proper criminal proceedings and should not be discussed in terms of criminal justice,” said Kirill Koroteev, senior lawyer at the human rights organisation Memorial. “It is certainly relatively new to the system that this is being applied to foreign nationals, but in general, the absence of justice in criminal cases has long been the rule.”
>
>Mr Sentsov has stated that he was tortured and threatened with rape during pre-trial detention, but investigators claimed that he had sado-masochist tendencies and had bruised himself.
>
>When the judge read the sentence in Mr Sentsov’s and Mr Kolchenko’s case on Tuesday, the two defendants smiled and started singing the Ukrainian national anthem. Last week, Mr Sentsov had used his closing remarks for an impassioned plea to the Russian people to overcome its fear and lethargy. “We also had a criminal regime, but we came out against it,” he said. “The same thing will happen with you, sooner or later.”

>
>…
>
>But if it were up to Zaluzhny alone, this is not how he would get the job done. He would fight with air superiority. He would fire back at least as many shells as the Russians are firing at his troops. And he would have cruise missiles that could match Moscow’s. Instead, modern fighter jets, such as the U.S.-made F-16, are not expected on the battlefield until next year. Ukraine’s ammunition supply is constrained, with the Russians often shooting three times as much in a day.
>
>And Western allies, citing fears of escalating the war with Russia, have placed a condition on the longer-range missiles and other materiel they’ve so far provided: They can’t be used to strike Russian soil.
>
>So, Zaluzhny said, he uses weapons made in Ukraine for the frequent strikes across the border that Kyiv never officially acknowledges as its own.
>
>“To save my people, why do I have to ask someone for permission what to do on enemy territory?” Zaluzhny recently told The Washington Post in a rare interview. “For some reason, I have to think that I’m not allowed to do anything there. Why? Because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin will … use nuclear weapons? The kids who are dying don’t care.”
>
>“This is our problem, and it is up to us to decide how to kill this enemy. It is possible and necessary to kill on his territory in a war. If our partners are afraid to use their weapons, we will kill with our own. But only as much as is necessary.”
>
>The challenges facing Zaluzhny and his forces are significant. Even after he orchestrated a series of military feats — a defensive stand that forced the Russians to retreat from around Kyiv and counteroffensives that expelled the invading troops from the northeast Kharkiv region and the southern regional capital of Kherson last year — large swaths of Ukraine’s east and south, about a fifth of the country, remain occupied.
>
>Carrying out a counteroffensive to reclaim that territory, defeat Russia and minimize Ukraine’s casualties requires resources that Zaluzhny said he’s still lacking. Western officials have said Ukraine has enough to succeed, but Zaluzhny was sharply critical of counterparts who have argued that Kyiv doesn’t need F-16s. Their own militaries would never fight like this, he said in the interview.
>
>…
>
>But behind the scenes, the worries and responsibility weigh on him.
>
>“One question I get asked is, ‘How can you stand it?’” Zaluzhny said.
>
>“I have to live with it,” he said. “Every day, it’s those who were killed. Every day, it’s the maimed, the missing. It’s tears.”
>
>…
>
>Zaluzhny, however, isn’t shy about his intent to reclaim Crimea, the peninsula Russia illegally annexed in 2014, even as some Western officials privately worry about what Putin’s response would be if Ukrainian troops ever reached the territory. “As soon as I have the means, I’ll do something. I don’t give a damn — nobody will stop me,” Zaluzhny said.
>
>The figurative Western handcuffs on his military operations have prompted Zaluzhny to think more about Ukraine’s future — beyond this counteroffensive and this war — and how to make the country so strong that no one will dare attack it again. To accomplish that means producing weapons for defense rather than being reliant on others to provide them.
>
>He lamented that Ukraine is dependent on other countries for ammunition as partners struggle to meet the demand. The more Ukraine can fire, pinning down Russian forces, the fewer casualties it will suffer, Zaluzhny said. But what happens if the precious resource becomes scarcer the longer the war lasts?
>
>“I’ve been asking myself that since last March — and not just myself; I ask it everywhere I can ask it,” Zaluzhny said.
>
>…
>
>But Zaluzhny expects that even after the war, he’ll be busy. His concept of victory is more than just Ukraine restoring its full territorial integrity.
>
>“Victory will be when we will have an army — maybe even a not-insignificant one — that will guarantee the safety of children who are now riding in baby carriages, so that they grow up knowing that this won’t happen again,” Zaluzhny said. “And that’s a tremendous amount of work. It has to start now.”

>
>The data you took refers to ‘70 conflicts and crises’ - of which, only Russia’s war has the internationally agreed definition of a war. Half of that 70 refers to political issues being monitored - like new appointments or opposition protests. Almost all of the rest refer to internal conflicts.
>
>There is no other example of a war of aggression to annihilate a sovereign nation (known as the supreme crime of international law, as established at the Nuremberg trials). There is no other example of a nation’s ability to even compete at the Olympics being systemically destroyed. Your first duty is supposed to be the protection of athletes, by the way. They are being murdered in Ukraine right now. Their sport facilities are being targeted by missiles. You know the intention is to wipe out one of your member nations.
>
>As a result, there is also no other Olympic member nation urgently pleading to the Olympic community to uphold the Olympic values by upholding the sanctions on athletes from the aggressor nations.
>
>But you want to reverse that (bizarrely, amidst the worsening of the aggressor’s crimes) so they can compete as ‘neutrals’ - even though Russia has shown there is no meaningful concept at the Olympics by continuously exploiting its ‘neutral’ athletes for its war propaganda.
>
>Athletes around the world have spoken out against your position. Many have stood up publicly to say the Olympic values and the safety of Ukrainians should take priority over allowing athletes from the aggressor nations to be at the Olympics. Even the President of World Athletics Seb Coe is absolutely clear that athletes from the aggressor nations should not compete.

>You added ‘wars’ into the title of the data and then the people who repeat your propaganda drop the rest about ‘crises’ so it sounds like there are 70 wars taking place.
>
>You then asked why no country supporting Ukraine & the Olympic values has responded to the other “70 wars, conflicts, and crises”. But you know full well that no other member nation has requested a response because no other sovereign nation is facing a genocidal war for its very existence. Your line of attack here is just so disingenuous. Everyone can see that.

>Thomas Bach’s leadership of the IOC has been defined by gushing praise for Putin and then dragging down the IOC into the weakest possible response every time his old buddy causes yet another outrage. That includes mass state doping and violations of the Olympic truce - all committed by Putin & Russia. These acts should be totally unacceptable to anyone who cares about the Olympics. Excluding athletes from the cheating aggressor nation as a sanction shouldn’t come close to a concern.
>
>Bach’s positions don’t make sense based on his stated goals when he was running for the leadership. But then it’s widely understood that Russia was a key backer of Thomas Bach’s IOC leadership bid.
>
>Deplorable indeed.
>
>Bach may have gotten away with that wet glove all those years ago, but his abuse of the Olympics has to end. The Olympics is only possible due to international law, hence why it was cancelled entirely the last time a dictator tried to annihilate other nations (after first using the Olympics for propaganda).

Such conclusions can be drawn from the data of independent statistics, which OSINT expert Jakub Janovsky draws attention to in his Twitter thread .

The ratio of losses of 1 to 3 in equipment, and even vice versa, not for the attacking side, but for the one that sits on the defensive - completely destroys the previously established ideas of military science that the offensive forces bear greater losses than those that defend.

""On the one hand, at the meeting I gave an assessment of what they had done on the battlefield (in Ukraine), and on the other hand, of what they had done during the events of June 24. Thirdly, I showed them possible options for their further service, including the use of their combat experience. That was it.""

""The group exists, but legally it does not exist!"" Putin repeated in the interview. ""This is a separate issue related to actual legalization. But this is a question that should be discussed in the State Duma, in the government. It's not an easy question.""

Putin said he offered the 35 Wagner commanders multiple employment options, including one under the leadership of their direct commander, who goes by the call sign Sedoy [Grey hair] – a man under whom Wagner fighters had fought for the past 16 months.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-14-23/index.html

""There is ""no threat"" of invasion from Belarus, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a meeting Friday with military leaders, according to a report given by Ukraine’s military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.

The remark comes as Belarus' defense ministry this week said it was expecting the arrival of the next Russian military units as well as fighters from the Wagner mercenary group, who will take part in joint training with Belarusian forces. The country's leader Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, late last month claimed to play a key role in stopping the Wagner march toward Moscow and also said tactical nuclear weapons that Russia plans to station in Belarus had arrived.

In a Telegram post Friday, Zelensky also said that the protection of nuclear power plants and Ukraine's northern border were discussed in the staff meeting. 

Ukraine is steadily sealing off and fortifying its northern border with Belarus and Russia, also encouraging civilians in some regions who still live close to the border to leave for safer places. On Thursday, Commander of the Joint Forces Lt. Gen. Serhii Naiev said Ukraine continues to ""create engineering barriers directly along the state border; we dig anti-tank ditches and mine the area,"" adding that the goal is to make that area ""impassable.""

What else they spoke about: The leaders also discussed the situation on the front lines, new defense aid after this week's NATO summit, the current offensive and improving the Ukrainian military's supply logistics.

Ukraine's Minister of Strategic Industries Oleksandr Kamyshin gave a report on increasing domestic production of certain weapons, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and ramping up the volume of equipment repairs. Kyiv was a target of three consecutive overnight airstrikes this week, and there was a drone strike in the city of Kryvyi Rih this morning.""",False,1689336565.0,t3_14z5r9l,t3_14z5r9l,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4096784-gop-passes-amendments-that-threaten-to-doom-defense-bill/

Some quotes:

“If there’s funding for another war in a foreign country that is not our NATO ally, it doesn’t make sense and I’ve been saying that from the beginning. So I would have to be a no,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said.

“I’m still leaning no,” said Rep. Eli Crane (R-Ariz.). “It bothers me, the money that we continue to send to Ukraine.”

While Republicans approved many of the more controversial amendments on Thursday the House overwhelmingly voted down a series of amendments pertaining to funding for Ukraine, leaving some GOP lawmakers uneasy.

Greene said she will vote against the defense bill when it comes to the floor for a final vote because of her Ukraine “red line.”

Two Ukraine-related amendments sponsored by the Georgia lawmaker were shot down by both Democrats and Republicans: the first, which would strike $300 million of Ukraine funding authorization from the bill, failed 89-341, and the second, which called for striking the creation of a Center of Excellence in Ukraine, was rejected 95-332-2.

“I think it’s a great bill in so many ways and I want to vote for it, but leaving the money in there makes it something I can’t vote for,” Greene said.

An amendment from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) that would prohibit security assistance to Ukraine also failed in an overwhelming 70-358 vote.

Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, called the rejection of the Ukraine amendments “a disappointment,” but said the entire bill is improving.

Before this war, there is *nothing* you could have ever said to convince someone that such a massive number could occur.  Now that the number is so large it doesn't feel real.  A single local war somehow brings one of the world's large powers straight into the depths of oblivion.  

Just think about how badly this war has gone, every single line of it feels nearly impossible:

Total global sanctions

A failure on the primary objective, and retreat

Unspeakable losses 

A public coup attempt

Sudden unification of NATO *and* powerful new members added

So I'm seriously asking: in all of human history has there ever been another case where a *much* larger and much more powerful force attacked a smaller one and lost this badly?  With this amount of consequences layered throughout the campaign, the diplomatic front, and their trade routes?  

Maybe the Battle of Thermopylae?  That's all I can think of and it was a single battle by comparison, but is similar in that the disastrous portion of the campaign took 4 major battles over a year for the Persians to utterly melt down (Thermopylae, Salamis, Platea, Mycale).

Interesting parallel in that the conflict was started by an ego-driven madman at the head of a huge force with a dark, conquesty vibe.  Then warring against a group of allies who banded together to bring modern tech and combined arms to bear.

At the risk of being controversial I also think it’s important to address the elephant in the room and that is the possibility that Republicans in the US could potentially scuttle US aid to Ukraine. This is something that is top of mind across much of Europe but also something that European NATO members can’t really control or even say anything about because they obviously don’t want to get involved in partisan US fights. 

Personally I don’t think Ukraine being more or less “grateful” is going to move the needle in terms of Congressional support. The GOP members that oppose Ukraine won’t be convinced by some nice messaging and simultaneously the Republicans in Congress that support Ukraine understand why the fight is so important and are committed to it. The impact of how Zelensky and Ukraine message the need for support on the actual American voter is negligible. Americans in November 2024 will be focused on things like the economy, healthcare, crime, abortion and immigration. If I go to talk to swing voters in SW Wisconsin I would be shocked if I heard any mention of Ukraine. Even if the GOP does win in 2024 they won’t take office until January 2025 and that’s a long time. I think it’s far more important for European NATO countries to get Ukraine what they need to win in 2023 and 2024 rather than worry what will happen in 2025 from the US. Foreign policy rarely moves American voters but if there is one thing that would improve American voters’ support for Ukraine it’s making it clear that Ukraine can win and that’s something European leaders can help with.

Essentially, one of the points in that article is that the a lot of the types of artillery that Russia has left are slow to set up and fire, and therefore very susceptible to counter-battery fire, to the point of simply not being effective in the battlefield any longer. 

Covert Cabal mentions Russia might be replacing up to 12 barrels a day. This article estimates 8-10 daily. So basically still 250+ barrels a month, which they simply cannot replace with new ones.

If Ukraine keeps the current rate of destruction up, in 10 months that's another 4-6k artillery pieces gone, and easily another 2000 barrels.

That's nice and all, but artillery battles and overall theatre losses don't count for the 3:1 rule.

> How to Use the 3:1 Rule

> There are three principle strictures on the application and use of the rule. First, the rule applies only to local force levels along the attempted break-through sector - usually an area 20-50 kilometers wide. It does not apply to overall force levels in the larger theater.

> Second, this rule applies only to breakthrough battles, in which the attacker strikes head-on against a defender who occupies an extended and well defended front. The offensive, in other words, must be a frontal attack aimed at penetrating an organized defensive position. 

> Third, during the breakthrough battle the defender must fight largely from prepared positions and not rely heavily on counter-attacks as his means of defense.

>Russia’s Central Bank said Thursday that the ruble’s weakening was brought on by falling export proceeds.  
>  
>“We see that when our exchange rate weakens, various conspiracies arise about how \[the ruble\] is deliberated weakened to increase budget revenues… But we must look, first of all, at the dynamics of foreign trade,” Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.  
>  
>Nabiullina explained that the ruble — which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine — managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.

Similarly, technology is heavily influencing the way this war is being conducted. It is easier than ever before for near-peer opponents to figure out how the other side is moving forces. 

It is very likely the case that the under-supplied parts of the Russian lines are the same places where Russia has some confidence that Ukraine is not in a position to push. It would take days to accumulate forces enough to take advantage of a weak point in the line. The trouble is, the Russians would see that. 

I know Russians as dumbies is kind of a meme right now but it's safe to assume that Russia can see whatever Ukraine is doing in terms of force movement and concentration, and vice-versa. 

It's one of the reasons why the war has started to look a little stale-matey recently. We're basically at a point where it's a requirement to wear down the overall combat ability of the Russians as opposed to seeking localized opportunities at scale.

If the mine is exposed and sitting openly on top of the ground, it's likely to be sufficient to disable the mine, especially if there's a direct or near-direct hit.   If they're buried, like I suspect most of the prepared minefields are, it would take a sizable amount of force to assure de-mining.

For example, your standard US M58 mine-clearing line charge has somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 pounds of explosive per linear foot of charge.   That's enough to assure a cleared area of approximately 6-8m across at best case.   Your standard DPICM submunition has roughly less than 10% of that amount of explosive, and isn't anywhere as consistent as an explosive strip.  And with the cluster bomb shells being a mix of anti-personnel and anti-tank bomblets with different warheads (frag vs. explosive-formed penetrator), that dilutes the effect further.

So yes, it can disable mines, but I wouldn't count on it as a primary use.   The fact that there's normally around a 5% chance of munitions not exploding and becoming mines of a sort doesn't help matters.",1689345260.0,1689344888.0,t3_14z5r9l,t1_jrxmvdw,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Wagner is no longer contributing to the war in a meaningful fashion, and they were the most effective forces Russia had.

At worst, the equation is now much more balanced, which is actually quite laughable considering how much of a super power Russia was supposed to be.

Russia's best bets will be interfering with US elections again and try to weaken NATO politically, something which is far from guaranteed to work a second time (since so many more people are prepared for it and aware of it).
