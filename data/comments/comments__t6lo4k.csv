There are a lot of people who go, ""it's hard to know what Putin is thinking now, and why he's doing this."" I don't think so. It seems pretty clear. I'll try to do a quick run-down:

**Putin's time as a KGB Officer During the Cold War**

Putin was a 37-year-old KGB Officer stationed in East Germany when the Berlin Wall fell. Embarassed by the might of the USSR seemingly falling overnight, he maintained that bitter resentment over the years and stoked the embers of disdain for the West from the likes of Clinton's airstrikes in Serbia, to the wanton neoconservative aggression stemming from Cheney & Rumsfeld's war in Iraq under the Bush Administration. He began shaping his plans, using past instances of wrongdoing as precedent to permit further atrocities at the behest of his own legacy and Russia.

**COVID Lockdown Madness**

It's been speculated by intelligence officials and ambassadors that Putin's mental health has declined considerably during covid lock-down protocols within Russia. There, isolating himself from a wider range of voices, he was surrounded by the most ardent Yes-Men and extremist voices within his bunker. In Stalinistic fashion, anyone who dissented would've liked been seen as traitors and summarily fired or worse. It's thought that during this time his most radical ideas floated were lapped up by his ardent loyalists and amplified back to Putin, pushing Putin to act on what he otherwise might have more cautiously resisted. 

**Putin's 5,000-word Essay of July 2021**

This potentially led to Putin foreshadowing the Ukrainian invasion in his 5,000-word published Essay on thew Kremlin's website. In it, he talks at length about restoring Russia to its former glory as the Russian Empire. Within that, he explicitly notes that the entirety of Ukraine is of Russian territory and that, ""Russia was robbed."" 

This is thus much larger than any immediate economic gains; Putin wants blitzkrieg gains in territory for Russia, and he wants to cement his legacy as a leader who helped to restore Russia to its glory-days by way of military conquest. With covid-lockdown madness, he seemingly abandoned his attempts at soft-power, for it was taking too long.

**How does Putin Justify This?**

Cutting through the propaganda of the official line, how does Putin justify the actions he knows he's taking to *himself*? 

As with most autocrats, ethics and morality are largely tossed out of the window with an, ""Ends Justify the Means"" mentality, substituted by a deflective Tu Quoque fallacy of, ""You Did it, Too!"". Simply by saying, ""This is for the greater good and you'll all be happier once we're through this,"" Putin likely rationalizes that this is the needle of a vaccine before inoculation. In his own words, Putin believes that ""If a fight is inevitable, you should be the one to throw the first punch."" This of course speaks to his Cold War grudges and alludes to what he may have done during the Cuban Missile Crisis, contingent on the false-premise that the fight was ever inevitable in the first place. 

In his past, Putin has had no qualms with supporting dictators like Assad who used chemical-weapons blatantly on his own people. He's had no problem killing off or throwing opposition in prison via Kangaroo Courts. Even the Apartment Bombings of 1999 are considered by many a false-flag to bring him to power, journalists ruthlessly murdered who started connecting the dots with ease. 

This has nothing to do with Nazis in Ukraine (reminder, Zelenskyy himself is Jewish, and Russians just hit the Holocaust memorial as they killed civilians int he process); that is propaganda to rally his own troops and domestic support. It has nothing to do with Ukraine, a sovereign independent nation, joining a defensive alliance like NATO—that was only to ensure Ukraine remained vulnerable to seizing. Ukraine or NATO was never a ""security threat"" to the borders of Russia. In fact, neo-nazis have been on the rise in Russia perhaps more-so than many other nations. The reality is this conflict has everything to do with Putin ""rightfully taking back"" what he believes is his. *Whataboutism* AKA ""Two-Wrongs-Somehow-Make-a-Right""/Race-to-the-bottom propaganda, is just a convenient excuse. Even now, there are suspicious users online like /u/haekz incessantly spamming these rhetorical deflections to divert attention away from the Present, timely, and large-scale atrocity that isn't a matter of history but ongoing and can be stopped in its tracks *now*. Be wary of users like this, for their end-goal is that same race-to-the-bottom mindset. 

Ultimately, it is a race against time on whether the blanketed economic sanctions return Russia to the collapsing soviet union faster than Putin can rally these forces and take his gains... But lingering around every dinner-table in Russia and even among the Oligarchs is: ""How is this worth it to Russia?"" The value of Ukraine in its entirety gained means nothing to the crippling financial costs that will sustain against Russia for years to come, leaving them as isolated and marginalized as North Korea. Even more so, the ironic thing is that if Russia takes Ukraine, that puts their border up against NATO no differently than what they were alleging to care about in the first place. 

**Why did Putin Pick Now?**

Putin is personally living the good life. He has a MASSIVE mansion, yachts, and the balls of a nation largely at his grip. You thought Fox News was bad. Propaganda runs deep in Russia, and dissent is brutally-oppressed. The only thing left for him is cementing his legacy. On the verge of 70, Putin knows his final years are upon him. Whatever action to ensure that legacy and his goals, he must take now. Now consider:

- Trump lost when he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet, for whom he and Oligarchs invested a lot of time and money, would withdraw or defund NATO as Trump publicly and privately floated. 
- Covid further happened, which likely delayed his plans.
- Putin then likely opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew and engaged with Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- The mud of Spring was fast-approaching, leaving a mechanized offensive vulnerable to further logistical challenges. 
- The domestic grip of his country is slipping, and historically there is no better way to rally domestic control than start a conflict somewhere and start stoking the feelings of Patriotism. Interestingly, this isn't working too well this time, it seems.
- Provided that most countries have been desperate to restart their economy post-coronavirus, Putin was hoping to avoid the worst of expected sanctions, thinking Europe and US wouldn't risk raising gas-prices further that might harm their domestic image. 

There were many things that didn't go as planned for him: dissent among his military; low morale; confusion; logistical challenges; poor maintenance of equipment; dissent within his borders; unprecedented unity among the West. The outward propaganda and his online misinformation war got summarily rebuked, and this conflict went on already twice as long as anticipated, according to intelligence probes. It was supposed to be a blitzkrieg, but now it's going to turn into a financially-draining and publicly-humiliating occupation that could go on for years. The public attention by Western nations got ahead of Russia's plans, seemingly causing them to hesitate and then jump the gun. It bought enough time to bring threatening Anti-Air and Anti-Tank weaponry that significantly delays Russia's advancements. It put Russia in a position where they could only hit targets from afar via cruise-missiles / artillery-strikes. But lurking around every corner are loyal Ukrainian citizens fighting for their homes, armed to take out an enemy who isn't even sure why they're there and why they aren't being greeted as liberators. This to me is partly suggested by the fact that 90+ attack-helicopters remained staged on the border of Belarus for so long.

This ultimately seems to fork Russian plans: They either must (a) Continue with the bullshit premise that this isn't an outright war and a special operation intended to mitigate civilian casualties, and thus cannot blatantly bomb city-centers and target the civilians (I know, they have), thereby exposing your true motives, or (b) Sit back with your mechanized infantry and support helicopters and tediously precision-target installations because you're too afraid to advance your tanks and air because of the literally thousands of NLAWS, AT4s, Javelins, and manpads waiting dispersed among the ground.

Russias corruption runs *deep*, so incredibly deep that I suspect most people would be shocked. Every single thing that can be skimmed or not done such that officers can enrich themselves is done.

Imagine your plane is broken because it needs parts but the person who ordered the parts ""ordered"" them but then they mysteriousyl never arrived or if they did they were sub-par. Oh, no flying for you.

Imagine you want to practice bombing in a combined arms way with ground forces and JTACs, oh, you can't do that because there's no fuel, no bombs and no parts, also there's no JTACs because that costs money to train them too.

Now, imagine you're told with basically only a hundred or so flying hours a year that now you need to go operate in the highest intensity war zone your country has fought in since 1945 and see how well you perform.

We will now start looking for ways to legally submit the gathered evidence to the ICC.

With that in mind, we would need your help to go over our subreddit and corroborate our findings and look for things that we may have missed, and if we do, please contribute to the discourse and reach out to us and we will do our due diligence.

By this point I think everyone agrees that China will support(ish) Russia as long as they’ll have benefits from such action. If not and if Russia becomes an economic burden to China, they’ll simply do what they did already after the Crimea annexation: for the Moscow crying of economic help the most basic financial response.

Historically speaking Russia and China aren’t the ‘best buddies’ many people seem to think they are. They have a common goal now, to stop NATO expansion in their respective regions and to annoy USA. Turkey looked like being diplomatically closer to Russia because they too want to make USA suffer one way or the other, when in fact the historic relationships with Russia are anything but good, and today only contextual.

The bottom line is that Russia is all alone with no strong historic ally like USA-UK or Canada-USA. They won’t get a lot of help from anyone because historically speaking they used to shamelessly bully everyone.

9656106e7d5f5648a546a767c865b989,t6lo4k,hzc0vf3,"How to Spot a Troll, and Why It Matters:

It is important to call out trolls here, both alt right and Russian/state actors, because they knowingly push conversations in directions that amplify fear, despair, and indecision. They seek to drive wedges between people and stoke division in order to make you - yes, you, the person reading this comment right now - stop thinking clearly and react out of those same negative emotions. Some of what this can accomplish includes creating the feeling that reality is ambiguous and unknowable (demonstrably untrue), that “both sides are as bad as each other” (a common Soviet-era propaganda tactic to soften criticisms of their crimes), and to make you suffer enough that you give up or tune out entirely. All of this achieves their goals of advancing their agenda of paralyzing their enemies(us), causing their suffering (which is both a means and an end), and leaving us more suggestible and prone to groupthink and excessive identification with “our side”.

Be careful that you know what you’re looking out for when it comes to identifying a troll. Here is a video series that really breaks down what they do (warning: it’s a sizable time commitment, but totally worth it): https://youtu.be/4xGawJIseNY

Here are some pointers:

A Russian shill will post according to Russian time zones. Generally speaking, they’ll make a provocative claim that they do not bother backing up. Their intention is to introduce ideas and arguments into the public discourse that stoke fear, raise doubts, and create a sense of general paralysis. Generally but not always, they’ll have noticeably weak English and leap for the low hanging fruit of ad hominem attacks quickly (see below).

In contrast, an alt right troll will likely be someone doing this for fun or to “own the libs”, and will have a largely cohesive account. This is a game to them; it’s how they prove their superiority over everyone else. It’s out of both malice and the belief that advancing the goals of white supremacy and hate are worthwhile(see the videos above for how regular malcontents are conditioned into true antisemites/fascists). They’ll employ explicitly bad faith logical fallacies such as:

The ad hominem, where they attack the person in question when they can’t dismantle their argument: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem

The straw man, where they recast the logic of the other person in question into something easier to dismiss and often not actually related to what they’re saying: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man

A red herring, where they attempt to shift discourse away from important points to ones that are not and likely also divisive: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring

At the core, a troll seeks to create a sense of unreality by claiming objective reality can’t really be known, stoke division with bad faith arguments and identity politics, and to make refuting them exhausting for both the observer and individual countering them. They do not argue in good faith, and will consistently try to push the burden of proof onto the other person when they make outrageous claims.

Do not accuse someone of being a troll just for expressing an opinion if they are presenting a logical argument or overwhelmed by emotion. These people will engage if you try with them. Those that don’t are the ones you need to be concerned about.

When you think you have a troll, double check their post history. If similar divisive and/or bad faith comments are common, it’s time to name them explicitly. Do not argue beyond an initial refuting of their position. Do not get drawn into an argument where they hope to find a single thread they can pull at to dismantle you and your point. Mocking their logic similarly makes it seem like just another internet argument between two equally wrong people. Once you refute their initial logic, what I like to say is, “This is a troll. Name, shame, and move on. They want to draw you in to make disputing them exhausting for you and the people who see it.” This is based on successful disinformation tactics employed in Eastern Europe - it works.

Breath deep. We can choose to be a community that works together and supports Ukraine and each other. It is, quite literally, under attack, and will require effort and awareness on all of our parts to maintain and support. We are all emotional because we care.

Don’t let the people stoking outrage and hate blind you to what matters here.

Edit: you can report trolls who attack you verbally under the r/worldnews reporting options. You don’t need to simply let their words slide off you; they could be banned and/or have the post removed for it.",1646411796.0,1646411596.0,t3_t6lo4k,t3_t6lo4k,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

The general consensus is that even if NATO intervenes with direct military support, that this doesn't necessarily guarantee WW3, and WW3 doesn't necessarily guarantee nuclear war. This is true. But it doesn't matter.

Earlier today, a simulation was posted pulling information from the International Atomic Energy Agency, UN, and CIA. It demonstrated how, within the first *year* of a nuclear war between Russia and NATO, 600,000,000 people would die. That naturally doesn't account for the permanent loss to society and civilization caused by incinerating most of the developed world.

Now, the entire population of Ukraine is 44 million people. Even under the most perverse and unprecedented circumstances (i.e., Russia deploying nuclear warheads on Ukraine), assuming everyone in Ukraine was annihilated due to war, a circumstance I think we all know is unrealistic, it still only represents 8% of the likely casualties that would emerge from a nuclear war between NATO and Russia in the first year alone.

Unfortunately, it's just a matter of scale. Even if there's only a 10% chance of nuclear war following a direct NATO intervention in Ukraine, it would still represent an overwhelmingly higher risk than leaving Ukraine to its own devices.

It's a terribly Machiavellian way of thinking, but at the highest levels of military oversight, NATO's leaders don't have the luxury of living by high minded ideals. It's their *duty* to think pragmatically and realistically. And the fact of the matter is that the deaths represented by the risk of nuclear war that would follow a direct NATO intervention overwhelmingly outweighs even the most catastrophic losses that could emerge from a conflict solely confined to Russia and Ukraine. And that's why NATO cannot and will not get involved directly.",1646412266.0,1646412166.0,t3_t6lo4k,t3_t6lo4k,,0,24,0,24,1,0,

> I’ve kind of quipped about this but I also worry about it in all seriousness — that Putin’s been down in the archives of the Kremlin during Covid looking through old maps and treaties and all the different borders that Russia has had over the centuries. He’s said, repeatedly, that Russian and European borders have changed many times. And in his speeches, he’s gone after various former Russian and Soviet leaders, he’s gone after Lenin and he’s gone after the communists, because in his view they ruptured the Russian empire, they lost Russian lands in the revolution, and yes, Stalin brought some of them back into the fold again like the Baltic States and some of the lands of Ukraine that had been divided up during World War II, but they were lost again with the dissolution of the USSR. Putin’s view is that borders change, and so the borders of the old Russian imperium are still in play for Moscow to dominate now.

> Reynolds: Dominance in what way?

> Hill: It doesn’t mean that he’s going to annex all of them and make them part of the Russian Federation like they’ve done with Crimea. You can establish dominance by marginalizing regional countries, by making sure that their leaders are completely dependent on Moscow, either by Moscow practically appointing them through rigged elections or ensuring they are tethered to Russian economic and political and security networks. You can see this now across the former Soviet space.

> But amid all this, Ukraine was the country that got away. And what Putin is saying now is that Ukraine doesn’t belong to Ukrainians. It belongs to him and the past. He is going to wipe Ukraine off the map, literally, because it doesn’t belong on his map of the “Russian world.” He’s basically told us that. He might leave behind some rump statelets.

> And he has put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. So he’s making it very clear that nuclear is on the table. **Putin tried to warn Trump about this, but I don’t think Trump figured out what he was saying. In one of the last meetings between Putin and Trump when I was there, Putin was making the point that: “Well you know, Donald, we have these hypersonic missiles.” And Trump was saying, “Well, we will get them too.” Putin was saying, “Well, yes, you will get them eventually, but we’ve got them first.” There was a menace in this exchange. Putin was putting us on notice that if push came to shove in some confrontational environment that the nuclear option would be on the table.**",False,1646413853.0,t3_t6lo4k,t3_t6lo4k,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

The really bright light that was bright enough to switch the camera from nightvision to true color was likely just a flare used by the Russians to light up the battlefield and make it harder for the Ukrainian defenders to see the Russians, since they'd have to be looking towards the light while the Russians had it at their backs. Most of the artillery fire was directed at the admin buildings where it seemed Ukrainian defenders were set up, this is where the large fire was. However, there were some tracers that definitely went back and to the left of the camera, which is where the reactors are. At one point the camera panned left to look at unit 1 reactor and you could see smoke or dust coming off of it. So I think at least one of the reactor buildings was definitely hit by something. Now these containment buildings are meant to stand up to a whole lot so that itself probably wasn't a huge risk. However there are tons of auxiliaries around a nuclear plant that if damaged, could create a situation that the plant operators would then have to bring under control, which would already be a highly stressful situation without being under the threat of attack. For this reason, it's why you saw a lot of people very concerned last night. However claims that the reactors could just blow up spectacularly from being hit by Russian artillery were greatly exaggerated. They hit it with a lot, but they'd have to do a whole lot more for something like that to happen. But nobody was saying the Russian's aren't crazy enough to do that either.

This man rides on the tides of nationalism- brainwashing the older generation. His ascension- cold bloodedly calculated through gang violence and corruption. 

Hitler made use of pure violence and charisma. 

Putin and Hitler both made use of a 'incident'- one a apartment bombing, the other the reichstag fire to ascend to their throne. 

Both have delusions of grandeur- but one made it happen with corruption. 

One kept on moving aggressively in foreign policy. The other toed the line with charm offensive while making his aggressive foreign policies starting with the chechens.

Putin, worst of all is not doing this war for nationalism. He is doing this for the sake of survival and self-preservation. He does not care that people die or if the war drags on. All he wants is the war and nationalism to go on so that people continue to think he should remain in power. 

He learnt the lessons of the Arab spring- but the wrong lessons. The lesson that a dictator must never step down. Why? Because he's so corrupted- all it takes is one president with a anti putin agenda, and putin is going to the gulag/jail.

They actually do have an answer, the T-14.  A new modern tank with electronics that jam missile tracking.

**BUT** sanctions imposed in response to the annexation of Crimea have made it impossible for Russia to build any of these more modern tanks.  They were supposed to have hundreds of them built by now, but apparently they have less than a dozen and they don't appear to be battle ready.

They were supposed to have new modern ground attack jets with stealth capabilities... But sanctions have caused that program to be slowed to the point that it is not clear that they will ever have the prototype stage.

Doesn't help also when you fire a truly effective minister of defense for a crony who has run down the military.

I was so timid and wanted to say so much but was taught that disagreement was basically disrespect and that they knew better because they’re older. I’m not a 25 year old, happily married, college graduate, and can finally see through the bullshit that was “We’re older/parents so don’t speak to us that way” and I no longer put up with it. Boundaries are drawn and reasonable conversation is pursued. Though they are often beyond reason. I’ve long mourned them and am saddened by the fact that I believe my life would be better without them. 

I write all this to say it can get better. The real world is tough, people suck, but life can be beautiful. Seek to learn and grow and you can hopefully influence change in others. But seek out your own happiness and peace. It’s such a breath of fresh air. I live a couple states away from my parents and the distance has been saving my sanity since college (which I also went away for)

Sorry if this was somewhat all over the place I just have emotions coming up where I wish I had the courage to stand up and speak up so so much sooner. I go to therapy thankfully but I feel so sad for my past self. I wish I knew then what I know now. I hope this is helpful for someone even to feel that they aren’t alone. 

One final bit for my wall of text. Try to love them despite all the things that make it hard to love them. There is value in understanding them even when they are not justified in what they feel/believe/do etc. They have their traumas and such from their upbringings that they most likely haven’t the slightest clue about.

> As with most autocrats, ethics and morality are largely tossed out of the window with an, ""Ends Justify the Means"" mentality, substituted by a deflective Tu Quoque fallacy of, ""You Did it, Too!"".

Spot on thesis. We (especially young men perhaps?) often assume that such utilitarianism is a rare mentality, even a heroic one, a willingness to sacrifice for the Greater Good. 

But the willingness to sacrifice *other people* is really not all that rare, mature, or justifiable. It's the attitude of a selfish child, or a bully willing to do anything to others because it rewards oneself. The meaning of sacrifice is sullied and lost. One further realizes that imperialism fever dreams are based upon multiple odd premises, ranging from a deep distrust of others and a deep obsession with geopolitical lines on the map.

Reacting to new legislation passed by the Russian authorities, BBC Director-General Tim Davie says:

> [image which says:

> ""This legislation appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism. It leaves us no other option than to temporarily suspend the work of all BBC News journalists and their support staff within the Russian Federation while we assess the full implications of this unwelcome development.

> ""Our BBC News service in Russian will continue to operate from outside Russia.

> ""The safety of our staff is paramount and we are not prepared to expose them to the risk of criminal prosecution simply for doing their jobs. I'd like to pay tribute to all of them, for their bravery, determination, and professionalism.

> ""We remain committed to making accurate, independent information available to audiences around the world, including the millions of Russians who use our news services. Our journalists in Ukraine and around the world will continue to report on the invasion of Ukraine.""

Ramifications? There are 2 major ones I foresee although definitely many more.

1) illiquidity of companies. If companies have a hard time raising capital they can't do things. Modern economies are build on debt and investment. For example, a group gathers tens of millions of dollars to build a factory and produce products. If they can't do so through banks or through stock sales or if that money rapidly decreases in value they can't build the factory. No factory no product. No product no sales/jobs/etc.

2) illiquidity of the middle class. If Russia is anything like the US their middle class puts money into stocks to help gain wealth. If those stocks crash then the middle class people who own them go broke. Now they can't afford to retire and take up job positions  leading to increased joblessness for younger people. And on top of that, they can't afford to spend so people who produce products have a reduced revenue leading to reduced company liquidity.

[The six reactors at Zaporizhzhia together generate about 20% of Ukraine's electricity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant) So far, Ukraine has been very, very good at keeping their utilities working during the invasion. Controlling that power plant, and denying the electricity to unconquered areas, especially Kyiv, is a big strategic win for Russia. 

If Russia follows the [pattern they set at Cheynobyl last week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chernobyl), they also gain a staging ground safe from Ukrainian artillery and aerial attack. Ukraine won't attack that nuclear plant with weapons that could cause critical damage. 

Danger to Europe: 

The Zaporizhzhia reactors are the [VVER-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VVER) type, which is newer and much safer than the Chernobyl reactors. The information that's public now indicates that the Zaporizhzhia reactors have been shut down, though we don't know if the operators finished the normal shutdown procedure or switched to an emergency SCRAM shutdown when the plant came under fire. In their shutdown state, the reactors are safe so long as one of the three cooling systems keeps working. This requires electricity from the nearby coal power plant and attention from trained staff. Even a worst case meltdown scenario for Zaporizhzia now would not be on the same scale as Chernobyl. 

Would Russia blow the plant up? I don't see why. If Russia wants to conquer Ukraine or control it as a client state, they need the electricity it produces. 

The Zaporizhzhia reactors have good containment buildings. If Russia wanted to set off a dirty bomb to contaminate the area around the plant, it would be easier to bring their own nuclear material from Russia and blow it up in the open than to tear open those containment structures to expose the nuclear material in the plant.",False,1646414209.0,t3_t6lo4k,t1_hzc290o,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

A couple of things I do see on this front that are incontrovertible - Ukraine has already mooted the idea of a counteroffensive and indeed in some fronts has regained control from the Russians. Even on the defensive, the Russians aren't effective right now. It's clear that Ukraine's ability to hold is not just the ""defender's advantage"". Independent evidence is that Russian forces have been hit hard, with issues beyond just those of simple logistics. Likewise, it seems that Ukraine has totally decimated Russian air power from a SIGINT perspective and that in itself is huge. Lots of talk about a no fly zone but nobody's really talking about the fact that Russia really isn't committing air power in anything like the quantity it claims to be able to.

I think the prospect of Ukraine pushing back is something we can't ignore, and definitely more likely than Russia pushing forwards in the short term. In fact, of the options, it's the one that offers the most stable peace. Russia can't, realistically, occupy Ukraine with its current forces under the current sanctions in any meaningful way. Ukraine on the offensive gives a good set of options for negotiating a peace. Of course, that's assuming Russia doesn't throw the toys from the pram. Not without risk, of course, as Ukraine could easily overcommit or open up the possibility of burnout, but from the evidence so far, if they could bring this to fruition, and *sustain it*, they'd likely slice through the Russian forces like the proverbial warm butter-knife.

The situation in the middle is possible, though I think more likely to be effected not from Russia improving its position, but Ukraine's position becoming weakened from exhaustion, overstretch, and supply problems of its own. Ukraine is winning in direct combat because right now they have the momentum and initiative, allowing the Russians to move fairly lightly opposed through empty terrain and bogging them down in cities where the real control matters. If Russia starts to whittle back at Ukrainian defenders, and everything reaches a stalemate, then it comes down to a case of who blinks first, the Ukrainian supply lines, or Russia's domestic situation. Neither party has time on their side, so how this stalemate would be broken is anyone's guess. Several potentially very risky situations could develop though.

As for Russia making gains - they've apparently committed all of their massed forces, casualty rates might be in excess of 50%, and even their ""elite"" troops like the VDV and Spetsnaz seem to be going about this all wrong, using tactics that just don't match up to their combat potential. At this stage, unless they have something hidden up their sleeves that wouldn't trigger WW3 and a whole different set of problems, the prospect of quick, expedient gains on their part seems highly fanciful.

I completely agree with your assessments, but I would make the chances more like to 30, 60, 10, or even 40, 50, 10, although that may just be that the propaganda is working on me.",1646418423.0,1646418147.0,t3_t6lo4k,t1_hzcclzh,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

There are a lot of layers going on here. The first and most obvious is that Putin is crazy. Claims of him playing ""5d chess"" are ridiculous given how poorly this was planned and how poorly it is being executed.

His actual claim for Ukraine historically not ""being a country"" are actually superficially true, but deny any history post USSR breakup. This is an important and telling point because it speaks to the general aim of him and his cabal: return the world to the way it was before the fall of the USSR.

The more savvy geopolitical explanation is that he doesn't want NATO on his doorstep. This is based on the view that NATO is a hostile military power and could attack Russia. Although irrational it is a view that has been widely held in Russia since Soviet times and is foundational to much of their foreign policy.

The most likely explanation I have seen since this began is that it is all about oil and gas. Recently discovered large deposits of crude oil in the Black Sea and large shale gas deposits both in W and E Ukraine. Ukraine could be posed to become the next Norway if they fully developed these resources.

Obviously they are least had as good a chance as any of being functional when built, but the overall poor care shown to the Russian equipment in Ukraine seems to indicate that maintenance has not been a priority for their military hardware. And why would it be? It's not like they have to get into many direct conflicts all that often over the last 40 years. Lots of better stuff to spend money on - especially if you have a hungry class of Oligarchs who need to be bought to stay in power. (And a massive intelligence apparatus, plus a propaganda wing)

Now, if I was Russia, I'd have for sure kept the nukes maintained. But even the US has had serious troubles keeping theirs working right - and they spend dramatically more on the military overall than Russia does.

It well could be that many of them are in such poor condition that they just don't launch properly, and those that do don't arrive on target or when they do hit, the complex detonation sequence needed for the actual nuclear explosion to work does not go off properly.

After all the *threat* of nukes is often just as effective as their use in modern times. Why spend the money to actually keep them working?

&#x200B;

But nuclear power plants aren't bombs and can't blow up like bombs, and are engineered specifically to withstand things like missile strikes without breaching containment.

&#x200B;

The rub here is that cooling requires power, and if the plant itself is not generating electricity, it needs to get it from an external power source or its own backup diesel generators which obviously have a finite amount of fuel.

Ok then I'll give it a shot.

Russia in the mid to long term, has no chance in a conventional war with NATO. They are slightly outmatched or even with NATO ground power, and completely outmatched by NATO air power and naval power. The one area where they are even with NATO is nuclear power.It is commonly accepted by military strategists that in a hypothetical war between NATO and Russia, Russia would attempt to escalate to the brink of the nuclear level as quickly as feasible, in an attempt to get NATO to back down. 

If hostilities between NATO and Russia do break out, one of the first things that Russia is expected to do is either deploy a tactical nuke against a small concentration of troops, or detonate a large yield nuclear weapon over a remote region of the north sea. This would be to attempt to ""shock"" NATO into de escalating and forcing a negotiation favorable to Russia to end the conflict.

Unfortunately, this has an equally likely chance of NATO responding with a slightly more aggressive nuclear response to get Russia to back down. And then we are just in a cycle of nuclear escalation until one side backs down or a full nuclear exchange happens.

Why this would draw other countries in: China needs Russia in its geopolitical struggle against the West, and Russia needs China. China cannot sit idly by as Russia is defeated. Right before actual hostilities broke out, China would attempt to draw a line in the sand against NATO, that any military action by NATO against Russia would be viewed as an attack on Chinese interests. It might not happen exactly like this, but China would somehow let the world know that China views Russia's survival as core to its interests. This would be a deterrent measure meant to stop a conflict in the first place, however if things do escalate militarily, China would be forced to back up that deterrence with action. And then we again get a situation where what started out as an attempt to deter the enemy is now just a war.

When nukes actually start flying, the US will not limit its nuclear attack to just Russia. If the American homeland and nuclear capabilities are under direct attack by Russia, the US would nuke ALL of it's geopolitical rivals nuclear capabilities in response, China included. The US cannot lose its nuclear arsenal while a rival maintains its nuclear arsenal, even if they arent directly involved in hostilities. If the US loses its nuclear arsenal while China keeps its own, China then gets to rule the planet afterwards.

It's all very complicated and even these paragraphs I have written are very dumbed down and simplified. But the bottom line is that massive escalation is almost inevitable in a conflict between NATO and Russia.",False,1646415294.0,t3_t6lo4k,t1_hzc5wiy,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Genocide is happening all over the world. Myannar. The genocide of Muslims in China. Palestine/Israel conflict. Syria. China's seizing of Hong Kong. These are the ones I can say off the top of my head. I'm not even educated about how many thousands more there might be. We didn't risk nuclear warfare for any of these. Genocide was not the line.

Europe and the USA have already proven time and time again that genocide will not be the catalyst to WWIII. We're all angry and furious about this one invasion in particular because ""Ukraine"" is a country that we actually recognize by name if you've completed a basic highschool history class. Politicians and businesses care about Ukraine because Ukraine is a massive economic exporter of wheat, grain and fertilizer. Belarus gets a Putin puppet installed? Slap on the wrist, don't do it. Russia invades Crimea? Slap on the wrist, don't do it. China invades Hong Kong? Slap on the wrist, stop it. 

Our world leaders have made clear that genocide will not be the line crossed to risk nuclear warfare. No matter how angry, upset, furious and enraged we are, no matter how much of sitting ducks we are, no matter how much we want to punish the bully sitting in the Kremlin throne, in the end - the war on Ukraine ISN'T different. I'm sorry, it just isn't. It's not different from Syria, or Israel, or whatever other terrible mass wars are out there right now. We want our leading nations to treat Ukraine as if it's different and special - but fact is, they're looking at it like they have every other war: ""If the enemy launches a nuke, will we live?"" 

**That said.** I do want them to take some kind of action. That's enough. I know jack shit about how nuclear launch systems work. But at this point if there's a way to disable the system or prevent it, I'd say let's just do it. Promote the Ukraine Foreign Military division accepting volunteers. Start breaching Russia's internet, radio and TV and showing the atrocities happening in Ukraine. Start threatening actual no-fly zones, or give Ukrainians the planes to do it themselves. We've never drawn the line at genocide before. But that can change. It *should* change. So we can set a precedent for the future, and ACTUALLY draw the lines at genocide in the future.",1646413644.0,1646413150.0,t3_t6lo4k,t1_hzc0q8y,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

* Music. I know this is a cliche, but hear me out. Even before this shitstorm, I've all but banned sad music from my life, because I tend to get melancholic easily. I try to blast some heroic/epic/badass music to drown out the despair. 
* Introspection. Once I'm calm and I feel that the ugly feelings are coming back, I try to rationalize the situation. Things always get worse before they get better. I'm fucking mad about what's happening to the Ukrainians, and I know damn well that my country isn't that safe, either. I also feel guilty that I'm safe in my home while people have it bad there.

Authoritarian countries like Russia, China, Iran, Taliban etc do not share our concept of human rights and so the second tier, as important as it is, is not achievable. Our threats of sanctions can moderate their behavior somewhat but it can’t completely prevent it. And we do not have the power to defeat every authoritarian in the world at once nor is it really clear that it would be a morally good thing to do because it would cause a huge amount of global violence and suffering. 

So we (all human rights respecting democracies as imperfect and often hypocritical as they are) try to pressure others to be perhaps better than they’d want to be, but we also say really really really don’t attack NATO. 

If we told other countries everything you want to do that we don’t like—any human rights abuse—is just as bad as attacking NATO, they would immediately challenge and disregard that, because they don’t submit to our control, and the whole thing would fall apart. So we use soft power (sanctions) to discourage that behavior and sometimes they do it anyway and take the economic hit. If they step out more the sanctions get worse. However they don’t attack NATO. 

This current invasion is a bigger step against the second tier than there has been in decades, it is atrocious and more than anybody can imagine. So there have been worse sanctions than there have ever been. It might lead to a sort of middle tier where we make stronger moves against Russia falling short of war.

Setting that aside, even if there are Russian troops on every corner, there will probably be a very strong insurgency that constantly attacks them.  Russia will call them Terrorists, others will call them freedom fighters, or the Ukrainian Army, or irregulars, or guerillas, or whatever.

Their besieging Mariupol, trying to encircle Sumi, Chernihiv, and Kharkiv, and getting close to doing so in Kharkiv. They got 3 sides of it covered. Elements of that Russian push West through Sribne and Purluky was destroyed a day or two ago just 10 miles east of Kyiv. But nobody think's its sustain armor column, just a few isolated groups that made it that far as their struggling with logistics and fuel and that column is like 200km out from Sumi.

In the South their still struggling to Mykolaiv and their pushing up from Melitopol to take Dnipro. The nuclear reactor that's being fought over is not that far from Dnipro. If they take Dnipro they threaten all Ukrainian forces in the east with being cut off and only a short distance south of Kharkiv. Dnipro is almost the center of Ukraine in away, so taking it and holding it will be a big deal and can break the back of the Ukrainian military in terms of their ability to fight throughout the country in an sustained and organized manner. If they take it the Ukraine military will have no choice but to break up into little groups that the Russian will seek to encircle and destroy.

So it looks kinda bad for Ukraine. Though the issue is do Russians have the men and supplies to support all those units that made it to those places or are they gonna get their rear raided like they have been and get stuck in their current positions.

Whereas the difference between Kiev and Kyiv is that Kiev is the Russianized spelling of Kyiv which is a Ukrainian word. Like how most state names in America are Anglicized versions of the names used by the indigenous people who lived there before settlers and colonizers. Ukraine pushing for the use of Kyiv is to combat Putin's false narrative that Ukraine and Russia are the same, culturally. There are not.

So while it may seem frivolous to rename Chicken Kiev to Chicken Kyiv, it is in fact a very important symbol that reminds people that Ukrainians are not Russian and that this is an out-and-out invasion of a sovereign nation.

One of the hardest early lessons for a beginner Go player is that just because you can kill an opponent's stones, does not mean that you should.  Weak groups are a lodestone around your opponent's strategic options that allow you to push them around and make additional stragetic gains, even if they eventually get rescued you can often win on the back of the strategic concessions necessary for the opponent to pull it off.

It seems like the KD ratio is very close to 1-1. Maybe even favors Ukrainians a little bit. And if Russia is losing 1k/day to KIA, then they are losing 3k/day to total casualties. In 10 days, that's 30k (where we are at) and they are down 15% strength. In another 10 days, they'll be down another 15% strength, so 30% of their forces are out. Another 10 days, and they'll be close to 50% strength. That's about late March. 

At 50% unit strength, things start getting weird.

 >The decommissioning of Russian nuclear-powered vessels is an issue of major concern to the United States and to the Scandinavian countries near Russia. From 1950 to 2003, the Soviet Union and its major successor state, Russia, constructed the largest nuclear-powered navy in the world, more ships than all other navies combined: 248 submarines (91 attack submarines, 62 cruise missile submarines, 91 ballistic missile submarines and four research submarines), four  Kirov-class battlecruisers, and a missile test ship, as well as nine icebreakers. Many were or are powered by two reactors each, bringing the total to 468 reactors.

Right now, they seem intent on taking over the whole of Ukraine and destroying it. Putin doesn’t even want a ceasefire. Some brinkmanship escalation might be required to end the conflict, even if it’s in Russia’s favor. Your point about China putting their cards on the table to deter the west from attacking is quite frustrating to think the west didn’t put any cards on the table re. Ukraine before the invasion. Draw a line in the sand about what humanitarian cost they will tolerate. Right now only one side knows how to play brinkmanship while the other side is still howling about diplomacy.

Germany has a special role here because it used to be the lynchpin of West/East, and had a soviet state unified with them - so was in a unique position to be at the forefront of this approach.

Even after Putin came to power and did his first reconizably horrible stuff, this was still the sane option in order to try and maintain any influence.

 >As Allied troops entered and occupied German territory during the later stages of World War II, mass rapes of women took place both in connection with combat operations and during the subsequent occupation of Germany. Scholars agree that the majority of the rapes were committed by Soviet occupation troops. The wartime rapes were followed by decades of silence. According to historian Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it.

 >In political philosophy, a monopoly on violence or monopoly on the legal use of force is the property of a polity that is the only entity in its jurisdiction to legitimately use force, and thus the supreme authority of that area. While the monopoly on violence as the defining conception of the state was first described in sociology by Max Weber in his essay Politics as a Vocation (1919),  the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force is a core concept of modern public law, which goes back to French jurist and political philosopher Jean Bodin's 1576 work Les Six livres de la République and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes' 1651 book Leviathan.

As far as NATO goes, it's literally that simple. It's not an offensive alliance, it's not the world police. There's no difference, as far as NATO's involvement is concerned, between this conflict and one in Africa or South Asia or South America, where similar atrocities (or legitimately worse ones) are being committed. A country involved in NATO can choose to enter the conflict if they wish, but in doing so they lose their defensive protections under NATO. 

I get that it's shitty to think about that and to think that we're ""letting Russia destroy Ukraine"" but strictly in terms of NATO's involvement it's extremely black and white.

And that is what we are trying to avoid. You keep trying to make this distinction between ""NATO"" and ""NATO countries"" that really does not matter in the real world.    
    
The world does not run on technicalities. If the USA gets involved, you best believe everyone else is getting involved too. This whole ""attacking without NATO"" idea you've come up with in your head is not how the real world works. If this plan of yours is so brilliant, don't you think that the people actually in charge of this wouldn't have thought of it?    
    
Furthermore, you don't have to be a Putin expert to realize that he doesn't care whether NATO is  officially involved or not. You really think he just won't retaliate because it's not ""official"" NATO business? Again, the real world does not run on technicalities. NATO vs NATO countries escalates the war all the same.   
    
Ignoring the irony of you calling me a ""Putin expert"" and then immediately saying you know exactly what Russia will do, you claim that the Russians would 100% not do anything in response. Clearly the people in charge, who know what they're talking about a lot more than you and I do, disagree. Because otherwise we'd have stepped in by now.    
    
To summarize, the whole point is to not get any NATO countries directly involved whatsoever. Whether NATO is officially involved or not, a NATO country attacking escalates this into a world war, which is what we don't want. Not to mention, if one gets involved, there is a very high chance that the rest of them get involved. If this whole situation could be solved by a technicality like you're implying, it would have been done by now.

What you're failing to grasp, or pretending to, is that i'm not defending putin or his actions, i'm making a stance on morality and justice, if you personnally can prove that you're outraged about all wars and loss of all human lives, then that's okay and you're acting in good faith, if you can't, that means you're just a vicious hypocrite who don't hace the right to speak and should just shut it, as for the rest of the media and a bug chunk of people, they just showed how awful human beings they are.",False,1646410647.0,t3_t6lo4k,t1_hzbw016,,7,-7,0,-7,0,0,

You seem to have this idea that as long as NATO isn't invoked, everything is fine and dandy and we avoid all risk. The thing is though, it doesn't matter if NATO is invoked or not, or whether the USA is acting on behalf of NATO or independently. It escalates the war to a global level all the same. And if the USA gets involved, other countries will likely follow. It is silly to assume that the USA will get involved alone. And regardless, what we're trying to avoid in the first place is any NATO countries getting involved at all, because that's how you start a world war. Getting directly involved is a last resort.    
    
Not to mention, how would just the USA getting involved alone in any way be an advantage to all the NATO countries getting involved? It's just all the risk, and less reward. Makes zero sense. Either everyone stays out of it, or we all go in together. Those are the two choices that make the most sense.
