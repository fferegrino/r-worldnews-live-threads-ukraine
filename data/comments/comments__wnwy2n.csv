Day 172 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was no shelling, but it was still pretty loud sometimes, people were saying that it’s just our artillery doing its work. If not for their missile strike it would have been a mostly quiet day, but they decided to be especially active with their missiles today. I guess that is because they only fired 2 missiles yesterday, so they were catching up today.

Today their usual missile strike happened at 2:50am and it was the biggest one in recent weeks, they launched 10 missiles, some reports were even saying that it was 12. Four of them landed somewhere in the city and they did sound pretty loud here, other 6-8 missiles all landed in Kharkiv oblast, and we don’t know what was hit yet. 

With their missiles yesterday they hit Chuhuiv yet again, and they aimed at the middle of the street in a residential district, with only apartment buildings and a school nearby, all of which were damaged. No military targets were hit, but they injured 2 civilians, damaged/destroyed 18 cars, and broke all the windows in the buildings nearby. Their targets still continue to not make sense, and probably never will.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 14 August 2022
 
- Over the past week, Russia's priority has likely been to re-orientate units to reinforce southern Ukraine. However, in the Donbas, Russian-backed forces largely militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic - 1 have continued to attempt assaults to the north of Donetsk city.

- Particularly heavy fighting has focused on the village of Pisky, near the site of Donetsk Airport. The settlement probably remains contested. The area has been on the front line of the Donbas Line of Control since 2014. The Russian assault likely aims to secure the M04 highway, the main approach to Donetsk from the west.

Why is this significant? It could be just a coincidence, maybe the Ukrainians have a hard line there but we have to consider that Russia was concerned about the vulnerability of the bridges for supply. These lines have been static since well before the Himars hit the field. Artillery are the most logistics heavy units on the field. While they've massed 25-30k troops on the right bank to counter a potential offensive it seems they've left the artillery on the easier to supply side of the river. This could up to halve the supplies need to cross on the ferry and what ever light vehicles they can still get across the bridges to support the defence. While many analysts are still not sure if Ukraine ever actually intended or still intends a major offensive into this region the a wide spread supply shortage for Russian forces dug in on the right bank may take significantly longer to manifest if at all. Any Ukrainiane gains push deeper into Russian left bank artillery range meaning they have more room to relocate away from counter battery fire and more territory to hide in. While Ukraine announcing a major offensive has definitely drawn Russian troops and resources off other fronts I think its to early to call it a major strategic mistake by the Russians which have trapped their forces without enough supply.

1. Russia hawks like [Fiona Hill](https://www.cmc.edu/news/fiona-hill-addresses-invasion-ukraine) believe Putin is trying to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union, and reestablish a multipolar world in which Moscow acts as a counterbalance to US hegemony.  I find this view fits quite naturally with ISW's excellent briefing paper [How we got here with Russia: The Kremlin's Worldview](https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/ISW%20Report_The%20Kremlin%27s%20Worldview_March%202019.pdf).

2. So-called ""realists"" like [John Mearshimer](https://www.eui.eu/news-hub?id=john-mearsheimers-lecture-on-the-causes-and-consequences-of-the-ukraine-war) believe Russia was forced to act out of legitimate security concerns.  There have been strong rebuttals to this viewpoint and even noted realist Henry Kissinger reportedly no longer believes it to be the case.

3. [Boris Kargalitsky](https://jacobin.com/2022/07/russia-ukraine-war-media-public-apolitical-vladimir-putin) believes that war was necessary to solve domestic problems within Russia, and that geopolitics played a secondary role (if any at all).

4. Others believe it's much more mercenary, and Putin and his cronies just wanted control over Ukraine's natural resources for their own material gain.

5. In addition to various mixes of any and all of the above, Russia have also proffered a need to protect ethnic Russians from an alleged genocide at the hands of extremist Ukrainian ""nazis"".  That's right: at every opportunity, they project their own appalling behaviour onto others (probably to sow the falsehood that ""both sides are as bad as eachother, so why should I care?"").

The Crimean War in 2014, the Kazakhstan War, the Chechen war, The Georgian War, and the bullshit they are pulling in Transnistria are all to get back those 9 invasion approaches. Due to the above, Russia now holds 5 of those invasion approaches. The Kremlin see this as an existential threat to their power such that this might as well be a flow chart of Putin's foreign policy since he took over the country. 

Due to Putin's history of aggression, Russia now holds these five approaches:
1) Tien-Altay Gap; 2) Central Asian Corridor; 3 + 4) Caucus Coastal Approaches in Georgia; and 5) Crimea.

However, on the OTHER SIDE of Ukraine, there are 2 more invasion points, (the Bessarabian Gap and the Polish Gap) this is why they attacked from Belarus in the North (and why it was never just about the Donbas). They need to take ALL of Ukraine to get to those points (one of which is 1/2 through Poland).

The last 2 remaining invasion points into Russia are from the Baltics and in Scandinavia. Which means if Russia is successful in Ukraine, there will be a direct NATO vs Russia conflict whether it be in Poland or in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia.

This is why we have seen cooperation throughout the west in a post-ww2 unprecedented level. (In my view this is also why Finland and Sweden are at last seeking to join NATO.) The billions spent, the massive tonnage of weapons sent, and the swift training of Ukrainian troops has all been because the western world recognized it needed to stop Russia in Ukraine to prevent that direct NATO vs Russia confrontation.

If they have ammo they can just slowly work the problem from safety while pinning and starving troops with relatively little forces. 

It is assault by attrition. Forcing the enemy to respect your ability to push while robing your enemy of the capacity to do so. Eventually the line collapses because it becomes to difficult to sustain for the gains you could achieve. The counter to this is a direct offensive pushing the Ukrainians from the river front and supply line bridges... which Russia is trying and it looks like they are failing at achieving this objective.

Why is this type of thing important? It is smart. Ukraine is effectively defeating a large number of troops without actually engaging directly with a significant force advantage. It is extremely efficient.",False,1660508430.0,t3_wnwy2n,t1_ikalby5,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

It can just sit there, sucking up fuel until winter sets in, and then they can choose between freezing miserably, or surrender.

Meanwhile, Ukraine can rotate troops, supply them, whittle away at interior positions with aircraft...   And Russia has to keep supplying the left bank with artillery that can't do much except defend troops who are starving... 

... when the time comes, those troops will surrender gladly, and that will be a disaster for Putin.  he can't let that happen, so he either has to withdraw, or replenish... and he can't really do enough of either to make a difference.

Some are absolutely ecstatic about it and wish Putin would completely destroy Ukraine. No joke - I've some people clap and make toasts to the Russian army while their news talks about how successful their 'special operation' is. I walked by an outdoor wedding reception the other day where someone was giving a toast to Putin and Russia's fight against fascism. I have countless stories about this. 

They say things like, ""This is because America made bad promises to Zelensky"". Presumably they are talking about NATO membership, which they see as a steppingstone to Ukraine attacking Russia with NATO help, then stealing all of Russia's resources. Yes, most of them actually think that. They don't know that Ukraine had already been rejected for NATO membership, nor would they care if you told them. The fact that Ukraine wants to join NATO is enough for them to become bloodthirsty. They actually think Ukraine was days away from attacking Russia. 

Some tell me that they are only reclaiming Russian land, and blame the United States for supplying Ukraine with weapons. They say absolutely tone deaf things like, ""NATO will fight Russia to the last Ukrainian"" with a smirk, but reject the fact that NATO isn't fighting anyone, and if there's only one Ukrainian left after all of this it's because they were killed by Russians.   


And some just want to kill Ukrainians because they think Ukrainians are acting like misbehaving children because they wanted to become closer to Europe. You see, Russia thinks of itself as the defender of all Slavs and think this war was for Ukrainians protection. 

Most don't even think they invaded. They think Russia has *never* invaded another country, ever, in its entire history.   


I know two people for sure against this. One stopped caring after a few weeks, the other moved to Israel. The rest either don't care at all, but still support Russia, or wholeheartedly support Russia. I wonder if the people you know are telling you that because they think it's what you want to hear.

I'm curious to know which YouTubers you're watching that have said, ""I don't support this."" because I can only think of a few, and only one of them is popular.

Or better: many followed other leaders, and then switched to following Hitler instead.

I think I remember reading that Nazi support peaked only after Germany had successfully beat and occupied France.

Support for Hitler and the Nazis grew from 37 percent in 1933 for seven years. In 1940 it was a nationalistic furor, I‘m sure a large majority (not just a plurality) supported the regime.

I'm sure there are people in the US who could recount very similar experiences regarding vehemently pro-Trump views amongst their acquaintances, yet the proportion of the US that actually shares those views is what.. 20% or so (it's not even the whole GOP, who are not even half of all voters, who are not even 70% of all eligible to vote, who are not even the whole population).

That's the problem of selection bias: whether because the community around you are heavily weighted towards a particular view without being representative of the nation at large, or because the only people willing to share their views with you are those that lean a particular way, or because people present a false image in order not to stand out, or because a predetermined belief unconsciously causes the overlooking of views that disagree with it... or any number of other possibilities, lead to anecdotal evidence not being statistically useful.  That doesn't mean such views *aren't* shared by 99% of Russians—it just isn't evidence that they are, and one has to be careful when making such leaps.

Anyway, as to the Russian YouTube question... I particularly had in mind Konstantin's ""Inside Russia"" channel.  He's careful (for his own safety) not to explicitly criticise Putin but it is quite clear he is appalled and devastated by Russia's actions.  I also have seen on another channel (I forget which) street interviews with Russians who refuse to share their views, which itself speaks volumes.

Air superiority is nothing without the troops, equipment and coordination on the ground to capitalise on it.

It's also a matter of scale. We could give Ukraine 500 planes tomorrow and while it would help, even such significant numbers would not drastically change the condition on the ground.

The allies (particularly the US) make it work by having a technological and numerical advantage, and even then they will basically spend a solid month+ of taking out every key force element to make their ground forces (who also have a technological and coordination advantage) advances easier.

That is a legit concern. If your moving backwards your losing some supply regardless. 

The greater Kherson occupied region I'm talking about is roughly 165km long and 35 to 40 km deep from front to river. Russia controls the river it a significant obstacle but they will be working on more boats to ferry goods and i imagine air lifting a as much as they can by helicopter. Its a huge area approaching 5000 km2. They are spreading out and layering the defences. If the Russians didn't think they had a chance of supplying them they would already have people swimming back. Keep in mind my original premise is that not having to move hundreds of tons of artillery shells and charges across the river everyday changes the supply equation significantly. The Russians will be comendearing anything that floats along with anything they can get up the river or move over land from the ocean.

Symantic waste of words. Fine 

>HIMARS also absolutely can hit moving targets. They cannot hit variable direction targets. There is a huge difference to this. Due to short flight times and drone spotting you absolutely can strike a convoy on a road.

There is no indication that Himars have ever been used this way in practice by the US or taught to the newly trained Ukrainian crews or that the Ukrainians have drones capable of GPS target allocation or range to coordinate with Himar systems compared to traditional artillery which is seldom shooting at their max range and is fire corrected by drones. The Ukrainians have been using partisans and satellites for precision strike coordinates. 

>I'm using pallet as standardized reference for a given quantity of material. The price and quantity of himar ammo available does not make a pallet or two viable targets for himars if they can find such small quantities already stashed along defensive lines on the right bank of the river. This is also an example of one of the few advantages of hand bombing supplies. On a side note the Himars have yet to diminish Russias capability to fire conventional artillery in volumes below Ukrainian capabilities. Himars are great but the most basic counter measure drastically reduces their strategic effect. 

>Ukraine is also shifting to gaining air superiority in the region... which will absolutely remove any advantage Russia might have by being on the other side of the river. S300 systems do not just pop up over night. Each one destroyed cuts down air defense for days.

Potentially significant but the S-300 has hundreds of kilometers of range, we have little detail on how Ukraine will deploy the HARM missiles with their current aircraft and they are operating on very flat terrain. Ukraines combined arms skill is yet to be proven. Coordinating air in support of ground forces is no small feat, the US with the best equipment in the world suffers a shocking amount of friendly fire casualties in this manner and Ukraines nato style training since 2014 has been largely in straight ground force tactics. 

I agree that if Ukraine is successful it will be a sudden collapse but if they don't pressure the front with large assaults then the Russians aren't expending large amounts of infantry supply in ammo which lowers the logistical burden down to mostly food and the trickle of supply still getting in is even more effective at sustaining them. Ukraine needs to inflict casulties and make them expend supply as defensive positions will only be improved as time goes on and they dig in deeper.",False,1660516176.0,t3_wnwy2n,t1_ikayp2s,,4,-7,0,-7,0,0,

These thoughts *are* Russophobic.  I recognise that.  If I were thinking that way about someone purely because they were Muslim or black or disabled, it would just as surely also be wrong; if someone thought such things of me because I'm Jewish or gay, I think I'd be entitled to call it out as antisemitic or homophobic.

Am I being ""taken for a fool"" if I believe Igor's claims that he's witnessed such cultural bias against Russians in Finland?  I don't think so.  Is he ""disingenuously employing language and concepts"" when he names it ""Russophobia""?  No, he's not.

For select local tactical situations they absolutely can and are achieving superiority against Russia. Kherson is and always was an exposed front for Russia. It has an extremely long supply line and is relatively flat. Russia required air superiority to control the region... they now have lost over 10 anti air systems and an air base.

Total tubes.. Russia advantage.  
Accuracy of fire.. Ukraine.  
Range of fire.. Ukraine.  
Specialized shells.. Ukraine.  
Number of trained crew.. Russia.

If you are considering the prospects of the entire war Russia has a decided advantage in artillery power. Many people hear this and automatically assume this means Russia has an advantage at all times in every theater. This isn't the case.

When Russia has to supply those guns by anything other than a very short road and rail driven effort the quality of their artillery degrades rapidly. They MIGHT achieve superior number of guns and rockets but they cannot sustain them in a capacity that yields a superior position. Think about east vs west. In the east you are constantly under fire. This is because their supply lines are extremely short compared to the west. They can bring new tubes and shells anywhere very quickly. In the west they are limited to a select few paths. They cannot move enough fast enough to perform the same amount of fire missions per day as the east because they physically cant move enough ammo. 

In this situation accuracy wins. Accuracy means you can disrupt and degrade your opponent faster than they can you. In Kherson Ukraine has unmatched artillery control compared to the Russians. Russia can shell like mad but it ***isn't enough volume*** to degrade Ukraine's movement and fire missions. 

As far as strategic offensive capability you have a high misunderstanding of what that is. Offensive capacity is your capacity to degrade your enemies capacity to fight. It isn't territory. It isn't killing troops. It is preventing your enemy from moving and preventing your enemy from shooting. Ukraine doesn't HAVE to advance to do this. Ukraine IS counter attacking RIGHT NOW and doing an incredible job of it. As it stand they are effectively eliminating the entire Kherson region from being able to fight... without having to advance.

Ukraine for example is incapable of advancing into Kherson because the artillery across the river combined with Russian drone usage provide more than enough suppression. Russian tube accuracy combined with TORNADO cluster munitions is more than overwhelming to suppress Ukrainian movement. I believe due to the logistics available across the river it's not possible to really advance. 

I think that Russia is making up for poorer accuracy with pure numbers of munitions across the whole front. Ukraine is losing the short range tube fight by a long shot. The issue to me is that Russian tube artillery is not degraded enough on any front to allow Ukrainian troop movements.
