In the Vasilyevsky direction, our troops left the settlement of Pyatikhatki. Our artillery continues to strike at the enemy infantry, entrenched in this village. It is reported from the field that the Armed Forces of Ukraine have concentrated large reserves on the approaches to Pyatikhatki. This is mainly infantry, but heavy armored vehicles have also been seen. It's only a matter of time when they put the reserves to use. At the moment, the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are in a semicircle, and, most likely, the main blow will fall on one of the flanks in order to expand and secure the bridgehead from which it will be possible to start moving towards Vasilyevka.

Fighting continues in the Orekhovsky direction.
As we reported, yesterday afternoon the enemy attacked our positions to the left of the Orekhov-Rabotino highway, but was stopped and retreated.
By late night, the Armed Forces of Ukraine were again advancing along this route - this time to the right of it and were able to take several positions. Our troops responded with strikes from the heavy Solntsepyok flamethrower systems, tanks and artillery.

We continue to follow developments on the Zaporizhia front.

The last couple of days were actually surprisingly mostly quiet, there were no attacks aimed specifically at Kharkiv, but many towns in Kharkiv oblast were still hit with missiles and shelled. About 4 hours ago they hit Kupiansk with missiles, they were most likely aiming at energy infrastructure because people reported that Kupiansk and nearby villages lost electricity, though apparently it has already been fixed, which is great.

It doesn’t look like there were any large-scale missile/drone attacks after the one where they targeted Kyiv while the African delegation was visiting. It pretty sad that some members of the delegation said that there was no missile attack despite literally being in the center of it and going to the shelter with everyone else. Denying the objective reality is the specialty of Russians, so it’s obvious who taught them how to do it, but the problem is that not even Russians denied that they conducted that missile attack, which makes anyone who denies that it happened look like a complete fool and a Putin’s puppet.

The Kremlin’s statements from the last couple of days are as stupid as always. At this point they don’t even try to sound convincing; they just spew the most outrageous lies and expect everyone to just believe them. The sad part is that a lot of people do still believe them for whatever reason. How the hell can you believe Putin when he says that they destroyed 5 Patriot systems when we only have 2 of them? And now they are even saying that we’ve been “demilitarized” because we started using western gear instead of the old soviet stuff. How does that even work in their own minds? It’s complete nonsense and with each passing week they continue to sound more and more deranged.",False,1687127994.0,t3_14cage2,t3_14cage2,,0,128,0,128,0,0,

With it being difficult to push straight for a breakthrough, whichever side can degrade the others logistics and frontline strength while replacing their own losses will eventually win victory. 

If oryx’s numbers are anything to go off, the ratio of equipment losses is somewhere around 1:1 at the moment, making this literally an arms race to see who can throw the most tanks, artillery and other equipment at the frontline and sustain the pressure. Industrially, the west does have a significant advantage, but only a portion of that makes it to Ukraine, Russia’s industry is quite poor but they can still reactivate some stuff from their dwindling stockpiles and do some reinforcing. It’s absolutely imperative that the west keeps up the supply of equipment for this reason, because Ukraine absolutely can win this war, they just need the tools to do it

Storm shadow has been a great help so far, and it’s clear that the Russians are having a far worse time behind the frontlines than Ukraine is right now, I also think all the repair depots that have been set up around Europe will have a much bigger effect on the war than you’d expect.

Before doing that, let's take a look at some of the things that were unsuccessful, and clear up a few myths, specifically the relatively invulnerability of the defense.  This wasn't about brave men being lead by stupid donkeys\* forward to be mowed down by mass fire - in almost all offensives the loss rate between the two sides was relatively even.

And most offensives were *highly successful* in their opening stages.  The problems came with the later counterattack.   The original attacking infantry was worn down and somewhat disorganized, and was pressing for the big break througn ""into the clear.""   
 In doing so they moved beyond the range of some or all the supporting artillery.  This swung the advantage over to the original defender.  Even more important, trenches had ""facing"" - they were **not** of equal value facing towards the original rear areas, the direction the counterattck would be coming from.  

During 1918 especially the Allies switched their tactics to stop pressing so hard, to accept that the advantage in attacking came in the first initial steps and became increasingly vulnerable as they attempted to break through.  They recognized that the grand push was actually a negative, and declined to do it.  The French called this ""attack and hold"" strategy ""biting"" attacks.

I think that's what Ukraine is largely trying to do now.  To use their advantage to eliminate the first lines of defense and not to become overly vulnerable to counterattack.  To slowly grind away at the opponent's men, material and morale with the hope that, as in 1918, the army loses cohesion and can no longer strategically resist.

No one denies that the Soviets had supply problems at times. They did. And sometimes you have to go to extreme lengths to address supply issues. The problem is that people present it *as if it were Russian military doctrine* or something. The idea that the Soviets systemically gave one man a rifle and another man the ammo is just absolutely false and absurd. Thanks to Lend-Lease, they nearly matched and sometimes surpassed the US in military production--despite their industrial heartland being either occupied or destroyed. 

I could easily follow similar logic and say that the German military eats horses almost as a matter of doctrine or habit because they did so after the Sixth Army was surrounded at Stalingrad.

c2d1b6c47012317c4627a87912185a7c,14cage2,jokodm0,"Yes. You’re understanding it wrong.

The interception range of a missile system depends on the interceptor being able to hit the incoming target before it hits the ground. The faster the incoming missile, the less time is available. The interception range for Patriot is considerably shorter against missiles than jets, just a few dozen kilometres. There aren’t enough systems in all of Europe.

The same is true for any system. THAAD is great, but only a very limited number of missiles and systems exist because of the expense. Again, they don’t represent a wall, and they’re heavily biased around SE Asia because they can actually be useful there against, say, North Korea.

This is exacerbated by the Russians’ published use of decoys and multiple warheads. A single RS-28 Sarmat can carry 10+ warheads, to pick an example. It doesn’t matter what missile you actually use for an example, because we don’t know what Russia could actually launch but we *do* know some of it is probably in working order. On radar, a balloon decoy deployed in the mid course will look like and behave identically to an actual re-entry vehicle, and a single missile can launch many of them.

Interception is not a realistic option against a determined nuclear threat. It has been impossible to confidently expect to intercept a determined effort at starting a nuclear war for more than half a century. It will probably never be possible again.

Thermal optics are also especially useful because they can be sent to allied nations under attack and they don’t require vast training times or logistical trains. If Russia attacked Kazakhstan tomorrow NATO may want to send aid but they probably wouldn’t want to send heavy weapons but thermal optics are very easy to send.

 Fortunately they aren’t the most difficult to manufacture and many NATO members have that capability. Of course there are still going to be shortages for Ukraine because enough weren’t being built in the decade prior to the full invasion but the goal should be that if there is another big war in the late 20s or early 30s that lack of thermal optics won’t be as big of an issue.

United under the banner of their motherland, they congregated in the open field, their ranks an intimidating display of national prowess. Their purpose was a noble, if ill-advised one: to stand still and listen. For two full hours, they remained immovable, like statues carved from stone, their attention fixated on the anticipated speech of their commanding officer.

The scene, set within the beleaguered city of Kreminna, was the embodiment of discipline and order in the face of the chaos of war. Their position, though, was not unnoticed. From their unknowing congregation in the clearing, a tableau of impending doom emerged, made more poignant by the soldiers' obliviousness to their plight. Their rigid discipline and dedication had unwittingly turned them into sitting ducks in an unforgiving war, the perfect stationary targets for an enemy they failed to see.

Across the battle lines, the Ukrainians had spotted the Russians' folly. From their position, the scene before them was not of intimidating military prowess, but of a blunder of epic proportions. Here was an entire division of the enemy, open and exposed, their movements stilled by the expectation of words from their leader. For the Ukrainian artillery, it was an opportunity that was too good to pass up.

And so, with their target sitting idle, they brought out their ace: the HIMARS, a long-range, high-precision rocket launcher gifted to them by their American allies. With its staggering fifty-mile range, the HIMARS was more than capable of making the most out of the Russians' costly mistake. As the Russians stood waiting for their commander, the Ukrainians prepared their counter-strike.

The conclusion to this dramatic irony was as grim as it was inevitable. The HIMARS launched its payload, the rockets arcing through the air, carrying with them the weight of the unexpected retaliation. The casualties, when the dust settled, were staggering. The sheer number of dead and wounded overshadowed even the most recent battles, a somber reminder of the price paid for the complacency and misjudgment in the theater of war.

In the aftermath, the scene at Kreminna painted a grim picture of the harsh realities of war, where one moment's mistake could lead to an unexpected catastrophe. It underscored the oft-overlooked absurdity of war, where an entire military division could become a target simply because they stood still for two hours. In the grand, grim scheme of things, it was a chapter where tragedy met farce, a stark narrative of the absurdities inherent in the face of human conflict.",False,1687116275.0,t3_14cage2,t1_joly83a,,4,15,0,15,0,0,
