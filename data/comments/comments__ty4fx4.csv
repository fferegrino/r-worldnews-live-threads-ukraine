Kuleba's agenda has 3 clear points: weapons, weapons, weapons.

The key takeaway is Kuleba's clear statements that any such distinctions between defensive and offensive weapons used by Ukraine on its sovereign territory is hypocritical. 

All weapons used to defend Ukraine are defensive. And he is absolutely correct.

Day 43 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling continued as usual. This time they shelled yet another shopping mall somewhere in Saltivka district, but it was closed so nobody got injured. The fire was enormous and it continued burning for hours, you could see the smoke from almost anywhere in the city, firefighters did manage to put it out eventually, but it took a long time.

Shelling continues even right now, it is pretty loud, but we are already used to it, it would be weirder if it was quiet. They don’t seem to be particularly interested in Kharkiv, they do continue shelling us, but that’s it. Most likely they were talking about assault on Kharkiv to divert our attention from Izyum, where they are concentrating their forces to try encircling Donbass.

Also today’s interview with Peskov was pretty weird, especially the part where he said that they expect this war to end in the coming days, either because Russia will complete its objectives, or through a peace agreement. Now it sounds like they want to end this war more than we do, they even admitted that they had suffered significant losses of their troops.

\- Ukraine has asked Slovakia to provide maintenance and repairs for their damaged tanks and armoured vehicles. State has no such capacity, but private companies could be involved. General opinion is it's going to happen, but will require some time for preparation. 

\- Slovakia could provide modern, Slovakia-made [Zuzana-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/155mm_SpGH_ZUZANA) self-propeled howitzers. Slovak Army is replacing them with newer version Zuzana-2. Right now, there are 16 howitzers available, Slovak side seems to be willing to transfer them to Ukraine. Training for operators will be required as Ukraine Army has no simmiliar system. 

\- Slovakia is not sending any fo their MiG-29s for now, as there is no replacement. Other NATO countries could provide airspace defense for Slovakia, there are talks going about this right now, but no results so far. Slovakia has ordered F-16s from US, but delivery is falling behind the schedule. First F-16 should have been delivered in first half of 2022, now it seems it will enter the service no sooner than 2024.

So you're murdering civilians to try to prevent resistance? Gee let's think about this. If I go into the war a relatively neutral party, trying to sit out the war and stay alive, but suddenly realize Russia might up and execute me and/or my family, why wouldm't I arm myself to try to protect me and mine? If I'm likely to get killed, I'm obviously going to try to defend myself.

Also, I get the impression that the war is mostly being fought between men while most women and children are staying out of the way. Now you're shooting kids and mothers in the streets, why wouldn't those mothers pick up guns to defend themselves and their children? Hell, eventually the kids might be picking up arms too as god awful as that is.

The generosity/unit of the west/allies is crushing Russian troop moral.

Forgot to also mention they notice how many volunteers they have from so many countries, nobody has come from any of the "" russian allies"" to volunteer for russia.

State of the art scopes, night vision, boots, helmets, are pouring in from everywhere. Meanwhile the Russian troops are eating expired rations, getting their heads knocked off while the oligarchs have robbed them blind. The  yachts are more expensive than the only aircraft carrier in Russia.

The unity is massive, and we must keep it up, that is the strength of living in a non-non-tyranically ruled world. Also very important to note Russias alliances are all built on favors and monetary exchange, the actual citizens within China could give a literal piss about Russians. That's not to knock the Chinese or china, but the friendship is at arms length. Nobody in China is raising money for Russia for russian troops.

>Meduza obtained files containing high-quality videos depicting the southern districts of the city of Bucha, Kiev region. The recording was made from a drone. According to the file metadata, these videos were filmed over several days, from March 23 to 30, 2022 (read more below). The recordings that we are publishing are another very important piece of evidence (along with satellite imagery in  The New York Times ), which shows that people in Bucha were definitely killed even before the Russian troops retreated from the city.
>
>In several videos, next to the bodies (at a distance of several tens to several hundred meters), you can see military equipment similar to the equipment used by Russian airborne units (probably BMD and BTR-D). On one of the recordings, people can be distinguished next to one of these combat vehicles. At this time, the bodies of the dead continue to lie a few tens of meters from the location of the military.  
>
>Why are we sure that the video was made before the arrival of Ukrainian troops?
>
>Three main arguments allow us to confidently assert that the video that we are publishing was filmed before the Russian troops retreated from Bucha:  
first of all, Russian military equipment is clearly visible on Yablonskaya Street, and on several shootings and on different days. Several armored vehicles are there on the 23rd and up to the 28th of March. In the video, dated March 29, Russian equipment is no longer on the street. Such equipment is not in service with the Ukrainian army.
>
> Secondly, the source provided us with raw, original drone video files. These files contain detailed metadata, including data on the time of shooting.
>
>Third, since metadata can be faked if desired, we engaged two independent experts who checked the shooting time using astronomical shadow analysis on the image. Its results confirmed that the time in the metadata matches the actual time of filming, and the first video of the dead could not be filmed after March 26, 2022.

From CNN's Luke McGee, Nathan Hodge, Lauren Kent, Claudia Otto, and Nadine Schmidt

Germany's foreign intelligence service told a parliamentary committee Wednesday that it has intercepted radio communications where Russian soldiers talked about shooting soldiers and civilians in Ukraine, a source with knowledge of the meeting said.

The briefing was the top item at the Wednesday meeting, the source added.

Those intelligence findings — first reported by Der Spiegel — appear to implicate Russian troops in a pattern of apparent war crimes despite denials from Moscow, most recently in the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.

Der Spiegel reported that the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence agency, intercepted Russian radio chatter about the killing of civilians in Bucha, and that some of the conversations could be tied directly to specific killings in Bucha that have been documented since news first emerged of an apparent massacre there.

‘Borodyanka is worse than Bucha’: 

A Ukrainian journalist who visited the town of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, has alleged that the number of civilians killed there is “worse than in Bucha”.

Roman Bochkala said in a post on Facebook on Wednesday that Russian forces had destroyed all of the town’s housing amid their offensive, alleging they had “wanted everyone to die.”

“People who were hiding from the air strikes were killed. The basements of multi-story buildings became a trap,” he said.

Bochkala added that it would take two or three days for rescue workers to retrieve the bodies from under the rubble that is strewn across the town.

His claims came after Ukraine’s prosecutor general said on Monday that the number of civilian casualties in Borodyanka may outweigh those in Bucha, where dozens of non-combatants have been found dead.",False,1649324448.0,t3_ty4fx4,t3_ty4fx4,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

In another Siberian city, Khanty-Mansiysk, a 38-year-old woman named Alina — she asked her last name be withheld out of fear of repercussions — also said she believed that her brother, a lieutenant colonel, had perished fighting Nazism.

From the article about Russian reacting to their casualties. It’s the perfect example of why much of Russia will be impenetrable to western attempts to break through Russian propaganda. Many of Putin’s most fervent supporters are the Russian equivalent of rednecks living in small communities in the middle of nowhere. We may reach through to people in large cities like Moscow but the rest of Russia? I doubt it.

German intelligence service BND captures radio messages of Russian soldiers coordinating Bucha massacres.

According to derspiegel, many of the messages match locations in which bodies were found. Also, some of the descriptions by soldiers are consistent with photographs that have emerged in recent days.

In the recordings, Russian soldiers casually speak about killing people. In one, a soldier describes how he shot a Ukrainian civilian ""off his bike"". Another talks about how Ukrainian soldiers are questioned, then executed.

The material seems to indicate that Russian mercenary group Wagner has participated in the massacre. It suggests that the atrocities are part of a deliberate strategy to break Ukrainian resistance by terrorising local populations.

Most disturbingly, the BND has captured plenty of similar recordings whose locations could not yet be identified. This means that there could be more Buchas around Ukraine.",1649376472.0,1649374700.0,t3_ty4fx4,t3_ty4fx4,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,ty4fx4,i3qnagv,"A week ago, the New Statesman published an article about the new Iron Curtain descending in Europe. Article [itself is here](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/03/how-europe-is-entering-a-dark-new-age-of-division), behind a paywall, but it's been archived so it's possible to read it via archive ph if one wants.   
  
The reason I'm sharing a week-old article, is that I see a lot of commentary that says ""Russia cannot even take Ukraine"" and ""Russia is weak, NATO would crush Russia"" and thought I'd share some information from the article to show that despite what's currently happening, we here - and in Eastern Europe in general - are still alarmed enough about what's going on and we don't want to underestimate the threat level to us and to Europe. If you're in France or the UK, Russian threat may loom differently for you, than for us. St Petersburg is only about 6 hours drive from Tallinn, Estonia's capital. 

About the changes in NATO presence in Estonia and Baltics + Poland from 2014 onwards:

> The new forces were non-permanent, rotating in and out every six months. They were also small: about 1,000 troops. “The EFPs were never designed to prevent and deny a huge, mass-scale invasion,” says Colonel Dai Bevan, the commander of the Estonia EFP, which also includes French, Danish and Icelandic troops. “But in order for Russia to get to Tallinn or Riga or Vilnius it would have to go through a multinational Nato battlegroup, which would draw those Nato countries into a conflict. So it’s not Russia taking on Estonia; it’s Russia taking on Nato. It’s a tripwire.”  


On Russian attack on Ukraine and Putin: 

>In Tallinn I meet with Kusti Salm, the permanent secretary of the Estonian Ministry of Defence, to find out what has changed since the invasion. He spells out how the war in Ukraine has transformed Nato’s perceptions, both of geographic threats and those posed by the Putin regime’s nature and doctrine.  
Geographically, despite its military setbacks Russia has still penetrated deep into Ukraine. Salm notes that, “Russia has advanced along a front line of about 400km in the south – about the distance from Budapest to Prague.” He is also concerned by Russia’s de facto military annexation of Belarus, which he says reduces the time Moscow would need to deploy troops for an attack on the Baltics “from months to weeks”. That could also make it easier for Russia to seize the “Suwałki Gap”, the 65km border corridor between Belarus and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, which is the only land link between the Baltics and the rest of Nato. The sense that the war is creeping westwards was confirmed on 13 March, with a Russian strike on a Ukrainian base less than 25km from the Polish border.  
Doctrinally, the picture is even more alarming. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine showed how reckless Vladimir Putin can be – with his slaughter of civilians and threats of using nuclear, chemical and biological weapons – but also how poorly he read the West’s willingness to support Ukraine. “The biggest attack since the Second World War was based on grave miscalculations,” Salm tells me. “There is no basis to rule out an attack on Nato.”

Obviously how we were less surprised about an attack against Ukraine: 

>Recent events come as less of a surprise in Estonia than in many other Nato member states. Even amid the naïve optimism of the 1990s, people here did not lose sight of Russia’s aggressive, dangerous traits. “Whoever really wants to help Russia and the Russian people today must make it emphatically clear to the Russian leadership that another imperialist expansion will not stand a chance,” Lennart Meri, the country’s legendary post-Soviet president, told an audience in Hamburg in 1994. What may have seemed unduly sceptical then looks prescient now. And many in Tallinn, horrified though they are by Russia’s acts in Ukraine, feel a certain grim vindication. “The invasion confirms the way we read Russia previously,” says Raik. “We now have to spend less effort persuading others of our point of view.”

The steps we've already taken to further our security:

>The Estonian government has just spent the equivalent of more than 2 per cent of GDP as a one-off extra investment in arms, including ammunition stocks, howitzers and mortars. (“We’re making sure we have more ammo than the Russians have tanks,” as Salm puts it.)   
>  
>Military exercises now follow a relentless schedule.   
>  
>And the Estonian Defence League, a partisan volunteer force attached to the professional military, is growing – 1,000 Estonians signed up in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

And two important notes, which are seen as crucial from Estonia, regarding this war and its outcomes:

>Estonian leaders are reassured by this and by the evidence from Ukraine that Russia’s forces are not nearly as formidable as previously thought. Leaders here do not want “help” from their allies – their country’s defence budget will soon exceed 2.5 per cent of GDP, and to protect the Baltics is also to protect the whole of Nato. But two main concerns dominate in Tallinn today.  
The first is the possibility that Putin emerges from his Ukraine conflict with the impression that he has “won”, or at least made some gains. “It is really important for Estonia’s security that Russia is defeated in Ukraine,” Raik argues. “If the West makes concessions to ‘de-escalate’, that could embolden Putin to go after the Baltics in the future.”  
It is not hard to understand why this scenario alarms policymakers in Tallinn. Russia’s state television regularly features commentators calling for an invasion of the Baltics. On the TV channel Rossiya-1 in mid-March a retired colonel even presented a whole battle plan: it began with a “radio-electric strike”, followed by the seizure of the Swedish island of Gotland and the closure of the Suwałki Gap from Kaliningrad. Latvia’s Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice-president at the European Commission, spoke for many Balts when he warned: “If you look at Russia’s… increasing anti-Baltic rhetoric – well, in Ukraine, it also started with increasing anti-Ukrainian rhetoric.” The Estonian government has launched a poster campaign warning of Russian spies who have infiltrated the country to obtain intelligence on border and military installations.  
  
Estonia was the first country to send Ukraine lethal aid (howitzers and ammunition, in December). Today it has exported some $200m worth of arms, more than any country but the US and UK, and an astonishing quantity for a nation of just 1.3 million. “The Nato ‘tripwire’ plan in essence was to be able to retake the Baltics from \[bases in\] Poland in the event that Russians invaded,” says Kross. “Only now are we seeing a shift in mentality towards actually seriously defending the Baltics in the first place.” At the defence ministry, Salm agrees that the tripwire strategy would mean accepting “parts of the Baltics occupied and cities wiped off the face of the Earth”. He argues that Nato needs to shift to an approach of “deterrence by denial”, or credibly showing Russia’s military planners that they cannot occupy the Baltics: “We need permanent boots-on-the ground, large-scale exercises, a war-fighting division-level command, reinforcement and reserves, and a full air combat power to ensure air supremacy.”  
>  
>  
The second major concern in Tallinn is that Putin might launch non-conventional attacks on Nato’s eastern states to test the alliance’s resolve, unity and its Article 5 collective defence clause.   
>  
>“Putin may calculate he can bend Nato unity,” says Salm. “He will be looking for opportunities everywhere to break it apart.” A sensitive point for Estonia is its Russian-speaking minority, especially around the border city of Narva. This community is generally well integrated but, says Raik, “some Russian speakers in Estonia, especially in the older generation, live in the Russian information space”.  
It is not hard to picture how such an attack might play out. A fake or false-flag “atrocity” is committed against Russian speakers in eastern Estonia. Putin makes a speech lambasting the “neo-Nazis” in Tallinn. He sends Russian “peacekeepers” into Estonia’s border region to see how Nato reacts. Kross says: “I can imagine some politicians in the West saying: ‘It’s just Narva. It’s a Russian-speaking city right on the border, only 60,000 people. We can’t risk nuclear war over that.’”

So for those, who say that Russia is a paper dragon - the people working in our ministries and military clearly still see a threat in Russia and the reason you still hear CEE countries putting even a heavier focus on getting permanent/increased NATO presence in our countries is because despite Russia's problems in Ukraine, it doesn't make Russia less threat to us personally.",False,1649321572.0,t3_ty4fx4,t3_ty4fx4,,0,52,0,52,0,0,

Anything could provoke the soldiers who occupied the neighborhood, Yevtushenko said. They had detained him, too, making him kneel in front of them for 40 minutes with a gun to his head while they accused him of being a Nazi.

> “They shot Vasil,” Yevtushenko said. “Just like that.”

> On Tuesday, locals laid Nedashkivskiy to rest in one of many sidewalk funerals that day. Yevtushenko has counted 20 neighbors who were killed, and he and others have been burying them in the gardens of their apartment blocks or in any open space they can find.

> Next to a makeshift grave of three people — a woman in her 20s and two men in their 30s — the detritus of Russian ration packs still littered the ground. Chewing gum, pickles, cigarettes and vodka.

>My piece on mass expulsion of over 400 Russian diplomats from Europe in recent days. It means that roughly half of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in legal rezidenturas (stations) in Europe are being kicked out. A big blow to SVR, GRU & FSB.

>A few other notes. No British expulsions and seemingly low Czech numbers, but UK expelled 23 in 2018 post-Skripal and Czechs 81 or so last year. Both countries also reached parity in embassy with Russia, as UK ambassador notes below. No-one left to expel.

>Secondly, not all expulsions equal. In 2018 many of 153 Russians expelled by Western countries were towards end of postings; harsher to expel at beginning. And keeping numbers low depends on consistent visa refusals for known spies. That has impact on your own postings in Moscow.

>Third, point is not just to stop Russian intel officers in embassies from recruiting & running agents. It's also to stop them facilitating (e.g. through diplomatic pouch) covert action by Russian officers & agents sent from elsewhere (e.g. Salisbury poisoning, Vrbetice bombing).

>Fourth, it's a fertile time for Western recruitment. As I note, it was Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 which disillusioned Oleg Kalugin, Oleg Gordievsky & Vasili Mitrokhin. Latter two became MI6 agents; former became dissident and moved to the US. Ukraine far bloodier.

>The aftermath of Operation Foot, Britain's 1971 expulsion of 105 Russian intelligence officers. (from chapter 24 of ""The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West""). Current parallel expulsions from almost every country in Europe could have an even bigger impact.

Gas production is harder to estimate, as they often require huge front up investments.

I think, following the obvious flaws in their equipment, vehicles, and supplies, Russia performed an honest audit of their military stores and discovered the truth that the West has long ago figured out: that their military might has been hollowed out from decades of kleptocracy and misappropriation.

The forces fighting in Ukraine right now is everything they have left. Everything that works, at least, and a lot of that is even still stripped down and worn out after years of neglect. Any attempt at escalating the conflict with more forces would necessitate throwing EVERYTHING they have left into the meat grinder, and given how things have gone so far, there's the very real possibility that they will exhaust their forces to the point of being rendered militarily impotent.

This is why Putin is so desperate to attain something - anything - that he can claim as a victory, no matter how small, so he can call for a cease-fire and end the fighting before the truth is laid bare.

*The wargame highlighted Ukrainian capabilities to employ killer-drones to knock out Russian vehicles, including tanks, armored personnel carriers, and self-propelled artillery. Open sources claim that Ukraine has over fifty such weapons on near-constant patrols and this number is growing. If only one drone in ten kills a vehicle each day, that equates to 150 vehicles a month and 1,350 Russian vehicles losses between now and Christmas. Moreover, the wargame-imposed daily success rate of a mere ten percent is likely a gross underestimate. Add to this the losses inflicted from thousands of anti-tank weapons and the Russians soon ran short on modern armor to support combat operations. Over the wargame’s year-long course, Russian losses in troops and vehicles approached the entire amount it had built up around the perimeter of Ukraine at the conflict’s start.*

From CNN's Oren Liebermann

The US has committed more than 12,000 anti-armor systems, 1,400 anti-aircraft systems and “hundreds” of suicide drones to Ukraine, the Biden administration announced in a statement Thursday evening.

The update comes after the US approved on Tuesday another $100 million in weaponry for Ukraine drawn from US inventories, bringing the total US assistance to Ukraine to approximately $1.7 billion since the beginning of Russia’s invasion.

That includes $300 million approved last Friday under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, in which new weapons will be purchased from defense contractors to send to Ukraine.

The list of weapons committed to Ukraine includes the following:

More than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft systems

More than 5,000 Javelin anti-armor systems

More than 7,000 other anti-armor systems

Hundreds of Switchblade Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;

“We’ve worked with our European allies and partners to level a set of devastating sanctions against the Russian economy and what they’ve done because of our sanctions is they’ve taken the money that they’re earning from selling things abroad and they’re forcing those exporters to take that money and to bring it back to Russia and to buy Rubles,” Adeyemo said.

“Every time they take a dollar or a euro and bring it back to Russia and they force their companies to buy rubles, it’s depleting their resources they will have to fight the war.”

Adeyemo wouldn’t directly answer whether Europe should stop buying gas from Russia, saying that Europe has a “commitment to removing themselves from Russian energy and that’s what they started to do” citing the ban of Russian coal Wednesday. 

The treasury is now focused on making sure they stop sanctions evasion and going after the “Russian war machines,” including its aerospace and military industries, Adeyemo added.

From Wikipedia:

Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy was born to Jewish parents on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, then in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. His father, Oleksandr Zelenskyy, is a professor and computer scientist and the head of the Department of Cybernetics and Computing Hardware at the Kryvyi Rih State University of Economics and Technology; his mother, Rymma Zelenska, used to work as an engineer. His grandfather, Semyon (Simon) Ivanovych Zelenskyy, served as an infantryman, reaching the rank of Colonel, in the Red Army (in the 57th Guards Motor Rifle Division) during World War II; Semyon's father and three brothers died in the Holocaust. In March 2022 Zelenskyy revealed that his great-grandparents had been killed after German troops burned their home to the ground during a massacre.  
  
Prior to starting elementary school, Zelenskyy lived for four years in the Mongolian city of Erdenet, where his father worked. Zelenskyy grew up speaking Russian. At the age of 16, he passed the Test of English as a Foreign Language and received an education grant to study in Israel, but his father did not allow him to go. He later earned a law degree from the Kryvyi Rih Institute of Economics, then a department of Kyiv National Economic University and now part of Kryvyi Rih National University, but did not go on to work in the legal field.

1. ""Will Russia use nukes if the US or NATO or EU does this or that""
2. Is Russia considering using nukes in Ukraine?

Keep in mind a couple of things:

1. Russia won't announce when it will use nukes since they will want the element of surprise. If they announce any nukes they get pre-emptively nuked.
2. This serves only to scare off western audiences about some impending nuclear war with Russia and make them less likely to support sending aide to Ukraine.

The fear of escalation is real and worth our time to discuss, but we have to get past this hang-up about different weapon systems being enough to draw nuclear retaliation. 

Putin knows he cant win a nuclear exchange. Additionally, i am very skeptical about the state of their nuclear arsenal. It seems unlikely that it was untouched by Putin and his oligarch’s corruption. Theres no way these people saw that huge military budget for maintaining and being constantly armed and didn’t think it was an easy steal. Tactical nuclear weapons use against Ukraine and potentially some non NATO state within its sphere are at most danger of the nuclear threat. 

The Ukrainian people have shown that they are willing to pay the ultimate price again and again for their liberty and human rights. They follow in the footsteps generations of people who have fought for a more fair, free, and just society. If they are not afraid of Russia’s nuclear arms as the most likely nuclear target then i think the US and the West shouldn’t be either.

Hi everyone! I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to provide some alternative views to some common views by redditors I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.  
  
To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the discussion points below.  
  
Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…  
  
**View:** “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to organges.  
  
In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.  
  
In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.  
  
**View**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.  
  
**View**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine. As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.  
  
**View**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”  
  
**Alternative perspective**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…  
  
**View**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",False,1649376287.0,t3_ty4fx4,t3_ty4fx4,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

There's nothing differentiating anyone in the world in this regard.  Sure some people want 'more' this and that, more stuff, more interaction, more privacy, more money.

>Zeihan: If you had asked me 5 years ago I would say he would have captured Kyiv in less than a month and the whole country in less than three. Now I'm thinking that the whole country will certainly fall in less than six but one of the characteristics of the civilian obliteration program that the Russians are launching is that it's not quick. It will take several weeks to reduce cities the size of Kyiv and Kharkiv to rubble - that's a lot of ordinance and the number of troops he has in Ukraine is wildly insufficient for that task. So you should expect - in fact I think we are seeing troop movements within Russia proper - moving many, many, many more forces to the border and we'll probably have a million Russian soldiers within Ukraine by the end of the year.

I think this is crazy and I'm not sure what troop movements he's talking about.

I understand that the world feels an obligation to help, but at the same time, entirely supplying Ukraine against Russia seems to be as close to NATO intervention as we can get without actually sending troops. That said, how does this play out? If, for sake of argument, all of this aid might as well be considered NATO support, how long do we keep giving them stuff for free, and at what point does this just be seen as intervention, and we get pulled in anyway?

First of all Slovakia has 1 S-300 battery and some 40 missiles (tho Ukraine has many). First they said we will give our system to Ukraine if we get two patriot systems which are vastly superior to S-300 especially since Slovakian S-300 is the original version that was never upgraded.

So Germany and Denmark said sure we will each give you one. Than Slovak defence minister chickened out. Germany delivered their patriot to Slovakia in like 3-5 days. Denmark said it will arrive by April 16th it’s being delivered as we speak.

Now Slovakia is saying no we want 3.  So Germany came and said sure here is 3rd. Than Slovakia came back actually we need 4 to secure Slovakian airspace even tho 2 would provide vastly better air protection than S-300 could.

Now they want the 4th one which might be provided by US. But they will wait for it to arrive. So they broke their word 3 times once the 4th one arrives its going to be late for Ukraine which desperately needs it a month ago.",1649356104.0,1649354578.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3qbpeg,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

The time Russia spent as a democracy (if you could call it that) is so ridiculously small it may as well be non existent. 

These people have been suppressed and crushed since before their country was even call Russia. For hundreds of years they've trudged on through misery after misery. It's formed the backbone of a hardy but complacent people. 

Then came what was basically national emotional abuse. The Czars promised land reforms to the peasants. They happened, but little ever changed for the people. The communists waltzed in and cried modernization. The country got its factories and machines, after slaughtering millions and forging iron from their blood. In the aftermath of WWII Stalin promised better lives for his ""little cogs"". Instead he ordered the arrest and imprisonment of every Jew the state could find, only stopping when he dropped dead from a stroke. Gorbachev vowed economic change for the betterment of everyone. As a result a small group of businessmen got everything and *the entire fucking country collapsed*. 

Democratic reforms? A voice for the people? Enter an ex-KGB officer with a ruthless streak and designs for the throne. He would lie and cheat and swindle and backstab his way to the top, exactly as his *chekist* masters taught him not so long ago. Now his name is one of the most well known in the western world. The last opposition movement in Russia started promisingly and ended with the group being branded a terrorist organization and its leader imprisoned and dying.

There are no high moments for the Russian people. Only hunger during good times and cooking strays during bad times.

A man breaks into your place and casually starts making a cup of tea. You catch him while he's rifling through your drawers trying to find a tea spoon. You yell at him and demand to know why the hell he's breaking into your place. ""I'm not breaking into your place,"" says the man.

You know he's lying. He knows he's lying. He knows you know he's lying. He's *saying* ""I'm not breaking into your place,"" but what he's actually saying is ""I'm absolutely breaking into your place, and you aren't going to do a damn thing about it.""

Such events happen on a national scale, with every institution, both with how Russia interacts with the world, and more sinister, how Russia interacts within the country itself. Eventually the man starts telling you it was his place all along, demanding to know why you're in *his* place. And, knowing you can't do anything about it, you simply start going along with it.

It's seen on every level of Russian society, from newscasters casually lying about things that are staring citizens in the face, to some xXxCykaBlyatman420xXx who joins your GTA V instance and starts crudely spamming explosions all over the map while professing absolute befuddlement and denial.

The more I look at it the more I realize it's basically what people like Trump do but taken to an extreme. Admit nothing, lie about everything, then admit everything and tell the truth, only to lie about the truth, and then admit nothing again. Make reality and your own motives so fucking confusing and contradictory that people feel utterly hopeless to respond. 

Russia's government quite literally props up its own opposition and then lets everybody knows it is doing this. 

Even when they are at their most insane it is calculated to render their people emotionally incapable of seeing the situation for what it is. Again, like Trump. Think about how many incoherent arguments you've had with Trump idiots. Think about how people like Ben Shapiro just spit out so much bullshit constantly that nobody knows how to respond other then to say its infuriating. What do you do? How do you respond? What can you possibly say that would make any of this shit make sense? How do you make such blatant, unbelievable, cynicism and lies concise enough that you can actually form a counterargument. How can you preach reason and morality to somebody proudly hostile to both?
 
The answer is nothing and you can't

Consider the new Trump line on Russia: ""If Trump was president this never would have happened!""

Meanwhile Trump called it ""genius"" and has been sucking Putin's dick for the past however many years. Then he publicly asked Putin to dig up dirt on his rivals, clearly implying he wanted him to win for that reason alone. 

How do you possibly find a unifying theme here? You don't. You get angry, you get miserable, you get hateful, you get *crazy*. Trump brings out the most childish, the most petulant, the most confused and irrational, parts of people. Even his opposition. You make the lies and outrages so numerous that people get numb to the dishonesty, that they take it as ""normal"", that they start failing to see anything wrong with it. Trump's base doesn't actually give a fuck about Trump, it's a fascistic narrative of national rebirth they're obsessed with. And in a world where nothing matters anymore that is all they have to grasp on to, their own paranoia and their faith in this one jackass. Create a world of lies, say everyone lies so it doesn't matter, then pretend that at least *your* lies are for the greater good. Ah but *then* you get to the good stuff. Jewish space lasers, secret bio weapons labs, democrats sacrificing children to satan. You lie so much, about so much insane shit, that even the people willing to believe your lies don't know which ones this week they are supposed to parrot.

And they were wrong. People needed to be warned better, and run faster. Instead they were given bad info, and many died because of that.

875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,ty4fx4,i3qhsuq,"You have to look at Putin and consider all the facets. 

He's a man, whose been a president pretty much since 1999 (the stint with Medvedev - I think we can all agree that in reality, it was Putin deciding things) and grown completely isolated. Easy to drink your own kool-aid, but become also suspicious of everybody and everything around you. A bit like Stalin, who suspected everybody, even his own family members IIRC. 

He's also a guy who had a good thing going in USSR and then it collapsed. 

Let me tell you a bit about USSR. What infuriates a lot of people, with actual life experience from USSR, is the fact that some western and even our own people spout nonsense like ""everybody was equal in USSR"", and whilst it was true to a degree - we were all mostly equally poor, for example, and most of us lacked access to certain goods and services on a regular basis - USSR society was still layered and you still had the usual upper crust, middle and lower classes of the society. People say things like there was no poverty and no joblessness in USSR. Well, joblessness was a punishable crime - even a drunkard had some kind of a semi-quasi job them, because they'd be put to jail otherwise. Many people had a place to live, yes, but they didn't own the place, the housing was sometimes in a poor or a shoddy condition, the space was usually small, sometimes the apartments were shared - shared kitchen and bathroom, and perhaps 1-2 rooms per family, housing thus 2-3 families in one place. Free education - yes, but you could mostly get into university if you were a member of the communist party AND had nothing incriminating to your name (if you had relatives, who were enemies of the state, you could be denied a uni place), free healthcare - yes, but the quality was often poor and out of everybody in the hospital, you as the patient had the least amount of status, even a cleaning lady stood higher than you etc. 

This was regular part of the society in USSR. But if you managed to get into a good secondary school - even then there were some that were more coveted - and then a good university; if you managed to get yourself into a good job, where through connections, family friends, etc. you managed to move upwards, chances were that you'd reach the level in USSR where your life would become much more comfortable. For example, it was common that certain enterprises or jobs in USSR had their own housing units built (often nicer, bigger, more modern than the usual commie block - still a block, but nicer), had their own private summer resorts you could go to if you were their employee/had been done well in fulfilling your quota, had even their own hospitals and kindergartens sometimes. 

KGB was a state within a state. To work there, you needed to be vetted and trusted enough. That on its own was already a factor that separated you from the rest. Pretty certain they had a whole host of perks that came with the job, that normal USSR citizens had to wait years for. Nicer apartment perhaps, or maybe a fast-tracked car (which you needed a permit in USSR to buy and you sometimes waited 5-10 years to get the permit, after which you'd need to wait to buy the car). Currency-shop access, where you could get rare or normally under-the-counter goods that you wouldn't be able to get anywhere else, which you had to buy with foreign currency - owning of which was criminal offence for regular USSR citizens (unless going abroad). There's a lot more there, but let's just say that with KGB, Putin's life was already a step or a few better than your average citizen's life. Him getting to go to live and work in E-Germany was for many in USSR like going to the ""west"". My parents have been to E-Germany - to them it was basically better than anything else in communist/socialist bloc, east with a western flair as they said (and knowing how oppressive it was, let's consider for a moment how bad the USSR must've been). 

He lost all of that when USSR fell. No more special privileges that came with his job, no more prestigious job abroad (some say that he was an insignificant cog in the machine in E-Germany, but the fact of the matter is that he was still working there), no more special shops or summer resorts because of who he was and who he represented.

In 2014, Crimea was annexed by Russia using a much smaller force than the Ukraine Armed Forces. In 2021, Zelensky had fairly low approval ratings. On the runup to the invasion, the FSB had allegedly paid off a number of mayors and Russian backers to essentially hand over cities. The fact that the initial incursion by Russian forces had parade gear seems to show that they weren't ready for a drawn out conflict. In short, the plan they had expected quick capitulation by Ukraine's army and a quick propping up of a puppet state (maybe under Yanukovych) in order to secure oil reserves in the Black Sea and [fresh water supplies to Crimea](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-ukraine-blocking-water-supply-crimea-european-lawsuit-2021-07-22/).

Where the miscalculation came in was how much Ukraine's army had changed since 2014 and how the Ukraine population wouldn't accept Russian rule despite some Russian sympathizers throughout the country. Those are soft metrics which are hard to gauge and Putin didn't read it correctly.

328313118cfb66d5390a36ace7999cd7,ty4fx4,i3tcayp,"SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) is extremely hard. When the US and coalition partners invaded Iraq, it took almost 3 weeks in advance of the ground invasion to suppress enemy air defenses. The US is vastly better trained (this isn't jingoism; it's a factual statement of hours of flight time, war game experience, and amount of ordnance pilots get to expend yearly), and apparently better equipped judging by how few PGMs we're seeing in Ukraine from Russian aircraft. Now, this was slightly different, because Iraq had huge quantities of obsolete SAM units, whereas Ukraine has a much smaller number of newer SAM units and a goddamn ocean of MANPAD launchers.

Russia: did not commence the invasion with a long period of SEAD; does not appear to have the munitions or technological capabilities to execute SEAD; has pilots with insufficient training to execute SEAD *or* close-air support; and does not seem to be technologically capable of dealing with the drones in use in Ukraine. Despite these weaknesses, they've continued flying sorties low and slow enough for MANPAD (man-portable surface-to-air missiles) systems to pick off their choppers and attack aircraft, and even a fourth-gen fighter or two.

So there are several issues:

* Russia did not budget for appropriate SEAD before the invasion, as the US would have;
* They are ill-equipped and poorly trained for that mission;
* And they are just absorbing losses to MANPADs and SAM units instead of actually engaging in systemic SEAD.

Whether it's a blunder or a conscious strategy of attrition, I don't know. It sure looks like a blunder to me, but Russia has so many advantages in this war that I do not want to get overconfident just because they botched the first phase so catastrophically.

If Russian government gets its funding from corporate income tax (~15-20% on profit), then it will receive 1-3 Billion for whatever government funding. Of course this is not counting for subsidies and tax breaks, that Russian oil companies get. I doubt Russian government would go full Soviet and take whole revenue or profit from their oil earnings for military without pissing people off. 

Of course, I think 35 billion is only from when the war began, number should be higher when we talk  quarterly or annually. Those numbers would be less due to European wean off.

Russia has always fucking sucked at modern war against dedicated and organised opposition without being propped up by Allied industry, logistics and advisors, and yet they fellate themselves as the most all-powerful army in the world.",False,1649371759.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3tnfed,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Putin needs to achieve a measure of success in this war in the coming 2-3 months. Anything longer than that and public opinion will start to wane due to sanctions, bodybags and injured Russian pride of a failed military expedition. 

If that's the case, then it really doesn't help him at all to conscript 100k soldiers today, because by the time he'll have them trained, equipped and send to the right place, it'll be 4-6 months at least. And even at that time, they'll be mostly bodies holding a gun, not trained soldiers that add value to his army.In the meanwhile, mass conscription would run counter to his narrative of a not war ""special military operation"" and come with a large political costs as it would be a hugely unpopular measure.

Provided current economic strategy continues, this is already a significant shift geopolitically. It's now about balancing the messaging and domestic popularity of further action. Cutting off oil/gas would create even higher domestic pressures which in turn could lead to less popularity/support of future sanctions etc by domestic voting populations. 

So it's a balancing act. Sanctions are long term anywhere with the aim to introduce political and domestic pressure in the opposing country. Short term however, look for further military support, logistical support for both the military and general public, political actions and gestures etc. These are the short to mid term tools that are of best use to Ukraine in general. 

Remember that the current round of packages came out when further atrocities (dead civilians/raped children) were revealed.  

Russia's last option of the current war/engagement is to try and create conditions for a domestic victory in the East. The likelihood of this, is low, especially now considering the difference in available logistics (guided munitions, logistics vehicles, etc) and morale. Ukraine on the other hand is fighting on the back of victories, new weapons and further guided munitions. Heavier weaponary is being provided and training on new weaponary is taking place. 

Once this current engagement is over, it'll be a period of huge rebuilding, investment and repair of Ukraine - which will require a lot of domestic support from neighbouring EU countries. Germany will be a significant lender of aid, investment etc, as will France and other major powers. If your domestic voter base is feeling pain because of previous actions (cutting gas/oil and resulting inflationary pressures), they're going to be less supportive. 

TL:DR; **Current policies are already moving extremely fast when compared to other plans. Cutting off gas/oil and creating pain/pressure for domestic voter bases in EU may back fire later when Ukraine needs further support in rebuilding. Other actions like further military, financial, logistical and diplomatic support appear to be the better choice. Packages brought in too quick may be short lived and ultimately fail to destroy the aggressor.**",False,1649329379.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3qvk7c,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Also worth noting that many currencies work with different systems concerning how decimal points are used.

USD/EUR/GBP (dollars, euros, pounds) all have a high value unit with a smaller unit that's 1/100 of it's value, a penny/cent. You can also have fractions of those in theoretical monetary balances, even if the coinage doesn't exist. So you could have 0.9 pence which is a decimal fraction of a penny which is itself a decimal fraction of a pound. You could have interest paid of $4.9773 which again has more decimal places than the usual coinage. In many Western currencies, fractional units are commonplace. In fact, fractional pence/cents are a fraction of a fractional unit.

In many Asian currencies (and I'll pick INR/JPY - rupees and yen - to illustrate this), decimal points are rarely used. The smallest unit allowable is a whole number, 1 unit of the currency. To get the same granularity and accuracy, that means that the base unit of the currency must be substantially smaller. 1000 yen is not a lot of money for exactly that reason. It would be like if dollars suddenly ceased to exist and everything was just in cents, there hasn't been a 100-fold price increase, you've just swapped the multiplier on your place value. Likewise, something 1000 metres long and something 1km long are the same length (as are things of 36 inches and one yard for the non metric people here), it doesn't mean one system is ""better"".

Thus, even if they were theoretically ""perfectly matched"" there might be 10,000 of one currency to 1 of another, because the smallest allowable unit of the second currency was 0.0001. It does not mean one currency is 10,000 times more powerful. It just means they measure it differently.",False,1649373027.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3tq2sd,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

The folk tale goes is that Khrushchev didn't actually remove one of his own shoes to bang on the podium. But rather he actually brought a separate shoe for that purpose, knowing full well in advance of the theater he would perform. And that, my friends, is Soviet Negotiation strategy.

Putin will NOT use nukes of any shape or form. To do so, would immediately turn his remaining and --arms length-- allies against him.  He would face the entire world versus Russia.  This he will not risk. He is not insane. Merely vainglorious. 

He knows he is defeated. He is looking for an off-ramp that allows Russia to save as much face as is possible. And therefore he has brought Khrushchev's extra shoe to the party.   But that shoe comes at the cost of first Ukrainian blood- and even more Russian blood beyond that. 

And this is not to say that quarter should be given (within the confines of the Geneva Convention)-at least to the borders of 2014 Ukraine (and no further).  But there does need to be an off ramp.

It's unfortunate you're getting downvoted,  but I would guess most people reason that either you're being purposefully disingenuous, or that you're ignorant of the scale of this war.

I don't personally think it's because of the former, but unfortunately with 95% of the people who ask these kinds of questions they tend to be.

Now that that's been said:

Firstly, Ukraine lacks heavy weaponry necessary for counteroffensives. Tanks, artillery and aircraft. They have smaller man-portable weapons in spades, but unfortunately it's not really viable to assault Russian defences with those.

Well, now it's clear that whilst W-Europe has had US bases for decades due to the Cold War, the border of the confrontation has truly moved towards the East. Moscow has shown it will tear through every and any treaty and convention it has probably ever signed, so whilst some would consider it gentlemanly to keep to the ""no permanent basis in the East"" solution between NATO and Russia, we think of ourselves like W-Berlin a bit. At the height of confrontation between East and West, W-Berlin had NATO tanks looking at USSR tanks in E-Berlin. 

We think that having a NATO base is just prudent. In C-European countries you still have US bases quite nearby in Germany and Italy, but Poland-Baltic states - whilst close to Germany - have a strategic weakness, which Russia would, in the event of an attack, gladly exploit to cut off the Baltics from the rest of Europe/NATO. Obviously, if Finland were to join NATO, it would somewhat secure our north more, although there is the sea of 80kms between us.

Both are Nazis and therefore subject to legitimate “liquidation.” Not only does Ukraine have to be dismantled as a state, the piece argues, but the Ukrainian population “must live through the hardship of war and absorb this lived experience as a historical lesson and an expiation of its guilt.”

You have some of those guys alongside some seasoned soldiers who are being rotated out of combat. A soldier who is constantly in heavy combat becomes less and less effective over time; they need to be periodically rotated out and assigned to quieter fronts (economy of force). Border guard duties alongside the national guard are exactly the sort of place that you'd send seasoned veterans and new soldiers.

Fun fact: this is one reason why the Americans lost so many men during the Battle of the Bulge. They weren't using the National Guard, of course, but they had green soldiers patrolling a quiet section of the front alongside seasoned soldiers (the 28th Infantry, sent to a quiet part of the front to recover from the Battle of Hürtgen Forest). The Allies expected the Germans to be in full retreat as they weren't getting any intelligence otherwise from intercepted radio transmissions or the Underground.

Except the Germans weren't communicating via radio anymore. And they weren't in France, so there wasn't much in the way of Underground presence. The ""quiet"" part of the front suddenly got hit by a major, unexpected German counteroffensive as the Germans hoped to destroy strained Allied supply lines. Losses were heavy because the Americans were overconfident and didn't see it coming - plus the troops there were weaker than troops elsewhere.

Today, we have very good intelligence about where the Russians are. It would be very hard for them to make a massive attack like that unexpectedly. At the same time, it obviously can't be left undefended... so it makes for an ideal place to station troops who aren't going to be as effective in areas which will see major combat.",False,1649388624.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3uospm,,2,11,0,11,0,0,

The force was part of the larger Allied North Russia intervention. As a result of this expedition, early relations between the United States and the Soviet Union were poor. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's claimed objectives for sending troops to Siberia were as much diplomatic as they were military.

Perestroika was going to do for Russia what Zemin's administration did for the Chinese economy.  It was not meant to create a discontinuity in federal government.  

The first mistake was allowing the formation of political parties.  There was favor enough for only one communist platform, which became the platform of hardliners antagonistic to these reforms.  Gorbachev continued to represent a path between this group and the liberal parties without having a party of his own from which to grow a support base.  He was also under pressure and against his judgment to maintain an antagonism with the US which was out-spending Russia in defense really just for the fuck of it and as an internal political tool for re-election.  This and attempts to suppress reactions and demonstrations in member states angered the liberal wing.  The communist opposition finally attempted a coup which they lacked popular support for, and got all extant activities of that party suspended in the process, shooting themselves in the foot.  Power then swung to Yeltsin and populism, and with republics creating referendums on their independence.  Yeltsin organized the CIS to replace the USSR as a limited federal body.

I wonder if people who bash Germany are aware that these former policies were built into post WWII- and post cold-war reunified Germany by design (of the occupying western powers) - and that the economic strategy was in line with the general strategy promoted by the west after the cold-war to build cooperation and mutual economic dependency so as to exert soft power for change and make military aggression very costly. 

Naturally, due to both its geographic location and historic role, Germany would be at the forefront of this, and thus would naturally have the most economic, infrastructural and industrial dependencies. 

I also wonder why it's apparently so hard to comprehend that in order for Germany to be able to actually re-militarize to be able to deter and defend against Russia, it cannot just cripple its industry (and public infrastructure - which would also risk losing public support for these measures) - and so has to phase out dependency on Russian gas with adequate replacements instead of just cutting it off within a month or two.

One can argue - and I would agree - that the failure of these former policies could have been recognized earlier. 8-14 years ago would have been a good time - but this again is explained by Germany's built-in (by design) reluctance to give up on rapprochement, which it saw as its duty given its highly internalized  historic guilt as an aggressor (where this internalized guilt was again - and rightfully - built-in by design). This failure of rapprochement has become strikingly evident now, and has caused the historic reversal within days of the invasion. 

... You'd think that one would at least try to get a nuanced picture, understand the history and etiology of these policies and the factors making immediate shut-down of gas-imports pretty much impossible (if we still want Germany to be able to re-militarize and stand against Russia) before jumping to simplistic conclusions... but then again, this *is* reddit.",False,1649311347.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3q7n7f,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

 >Interior lines (as opposed to exterior lines) is a military term, derived from the generic term line of operation or line of movement. The term ""interior lines"" is commonly used to illustrate, describe, and analyze the various possible routes (lines) of logistics, supply, recon, approach, attack, evasion, maneuver, or retreat of armed forces. Interior line strategies are based on the fact that lines of movement and communication within an enclosed area are shorter and safer than those on the outside. As the area held by a defensive force shrinks, the interior line advantage held by the defensive force increases.

It seems pretty clear that the few that do exist don't have all their combat systems operational and that the majority are nowhere near finished, and that they've been in that state for several years with no change.

Truth is, I don't think modern tanks were a priority for Russia. The T-14 is substantially more expensive than the T-72 modernization programme using the existing vast stockpile of tanks and whilst it might be more combat effective, that's actually not a reason to use it if:

a) it's no less vulnerable to top-attack ATGMs like the Javelin. If the enemy will kill it anyway, you might as well stick with the cheaper T-72 that's also a much lower intelligence gain if captured. Against insurgencies who lack the means to operate such weapons in quantity, a battalion of T-72s is more than enough of a substantial threat anyway.

b) you aren't prioritising large-scale conventional war. Russian doctrine, inherited from the Soviets, anticipates that major war is unlikely and that any major war they fight which actually *needs* armour will go nuclear, if only because they'll use nuclear artillery. Tanks like the T-72 which is heavily analogue and mechanical and features radiation protection as much as traditional armour, are exactly what you want in that battlefield. A highly digital tank with electronically operated core systems is not a potent post-nuclear combat vehicle because the electronics will be fried.

This war has been a big wake up call for Russia because it is a lot more ""army vs army"" than they expected in a conventional war, they expected Ukraine to fall and to be fighting an insurgency that lacked heavy weapons or nationwide communication. Instead, they're not in either of their two preferred scenarios and suddenly their equipment is totally inadequate.

No accusations. No lies. 

In fact, your fun little quote there is my exact point. They are being invaded by hostile troops and they are getting their cities destroyed and people killed, which is EXACTLY why I was asking how this is going to play out, both in terms of these support deals, and whether full intervention would actually lessen those tragedies by shortening the war and giving Ukraine real support instead of just supplies to keep them afloat in a conflict that they are struggling through and, despite fighting like hell, losing countless people, resources, and cities in. My point wasn't to stop supporting Ukraine, it was to stop letting Ukraine fight an essentially losing battle and consider taking advantage of Russia's own problems right now and strike while the iron is hot, hopefully ending this before it can get too much worse, or before Russia can manage to garner more support and assistance of their own, like they are doing right now in Belarus.

This certainly wasn't my intention, and tbh I still don't see how my comment relates to the ""Just asking questions"" thing. I honestly feel like my only controversial question was the one about how long we keep giving Ukraine supplies for free, which in hindsight, I can see how people may have taken that wrong, but my actual opinion is more that actual involvement at this point may be better overall. Supplying Ukraine for their defense is great, but as other people have said, what we have sent is only barely keeping Ukraine afloat, which logically means a longer term conflict, as well as more supplies, resources, and money being spent by the supporting countries; and worse, a longer war, more casualties, and more destruction for the people of Ukraine. 

If NATO managed to get fully involved, I just feel like this would all be over much quicker, especially with Russia basically being on its last leg in every way and on the verge of a coup. The longer this goes on, the more it's looking like a world conflict is coming anyway, so I guess the real point of my comment was to ask how long we keep just playing proxy war footsie and sending supplies to a country that is struggling to fight off its invaders and losing more people every day, instead of just nipping this entire thing in the bud and kicking Russia while they are down, and then gaining a sort of upper hand in whatever larger conflict may arise after that, if it even does.

The thing about aid and charity is that used correctly, it's a net positive to society.  An example is school lunch programs.  That's a form of aid.  Yet, it helps children to grow into healthy adults.  It helps ensure they do not cost society money from malnutrition and increases the likelihood that they will be a net positive when they leave school.

It is unscrupulous religious leaders who are the problem. Stoking fanaticism, religious groupthink, etc

edit: actually, the reason Europe had its age of reason and not the middle east was because St. Augustine actually reconciled greek philosophy, platonism and critical thinking with catholicism. 

The opposite happened in the islamic world: they inherited platonism too and were a relatively free and open society with women's rights, etc, but in the 1200s there was this islamist (I need to check the name) who said that the world was not possible to be understood and each second we subject ourselves to god's will, who can just destroy everything if he wants to.

""SEOUL, South Korea — It looked as if things could not get worse for the South Korean airline executive mocked around the world this week for throwing a tantrum over a bag of nuts.

Then her father, the chairman of the airline, Korean Air Lines, stripped his 40-year-old daughter, Cho Hyun-ah, of the titles she still had in the family-run conglomerate. He apologized on live television Friday for her “foolish” behavior, when she forced her plane back to the gate and then kicked off the head steward after being served macadamia nuts in their bag, rather than on a plate.

“I failed to raise her properly,” said the chairman, Cho Yang-ho, who bowed deeply and asked to take the blame, showing contrition in the traditional South Korean way when one’s child misbehaves.

As if that was not enough, the head steward on the flight spoke up after days of silence, telling Korea’s KBS-TV on Friday that Mr. Cho’s daughter had forced him to kneel and apologize on the plane as punishment for the way one of his stewards had served the nuts to passengers in first class. The head steward was kicked off the aircraft when it returned to the gate.

“You can’t imagine the humiliation I felt unless you experienced it yourself,” the steward, Park Chang-jin, said, adding that Ms. Cho called him names, hit him several times with a folder of documents and hurled it at the junior steward.

Ms. Cho later denied hitting Mr. Park or forcing him to kneel, making her statement as she emerged from questioning by government investigators looking into whether her actions violated aviation law. But if Mr. Park’s story bears out, it is likely to stoke already seething anger at the country’s family owned conglomerates — or chaebol — whose leaders have a reputation for imperious behavior and treating their employees like feudal subjects.

Forcing people to kneel in apology, a once-common punishment, has, after all, fallen out of fashion in South Korea.""",False,1649363786.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3t5tb0,,3,10,0,10,0,0,

The Russian troops will be ordered to not listen to what the Russians would call Ukrainian propaganda and to show no mercy to the Nazi enemy.  

Shelling the Ukrainians from afar also removes the human connection of actually seeing the people. But up close one person on their own may stop and think, but what about a group trained to follow orders?  

You will get some who know the truth, but what would happen if they disobeyed an order?  
It's easy to rationalise away their involvement as ""just following orders"" or ""if I didn't do it, someone else would have anyway, so what's the point if it's inevitable?"" or that maybe the officers know better than they do. I've also seen ""If the west and NATO cannot stop Putin then what's the point in me protesting?"" been given as a reason for some of the public not protesting in Russia.  

One importantly vital part of this is to dehumanise the enemy. Just look at how enemies are spoken of in wars and you'll see that technique used a lot.

However, it remains an existential threat and Putin is much more likely to fire first.

If it comes down to it, I believe that NATO will cease to exist before the US fires nukes at Russia in the event that the Baltic states etc are invaded. Which obviously sucks. 

Russia, if they were to invade the Baltics, would receive serious (and military) retaliation from NATO. But NATO will not fire nukes at Russia unless Russia fires them first. This naturally gives Russia an advantage. Russia would invade the Baltics, there would be non-nuclear war, Russia would keep the invaded lands and NATO would become meaningless.

Of course, that's an extremely pessimistic view, but I simply can't imagine a NATO member risking being nuked over another nation, defence pact or not. That's what the pact is for in the first place though - to dissuade hostile countries from engaging in high-stakes conflict.

AK rifles: not bad at all, modern iterations (AK-100 family particularly the most modern AK-107/8/9, and the AK-12) are perfectly respectable infantry rifles.

Fixed wing aircraft: Su-25 Frogfoot is old but like the A-10 tough as nails. Older MiGs are decent enough. Some of the newer Sukhoi fighter models are fine airframes worthy of a place on the world stage.

Helicopters: nothing terrible but Russia seems to struggle to let go of platforms that should have died in the 80s, particularly with a commitment to the Mi-17 and Mi-24 both of which are usually configured as awkward jacks of all trades, fitted with both rocket pod outriggers and troop transport seating and performing inadequately in both roles. The newer Kamov models seem better but still hampered by a bad strategy overall, that issue is a people not equipment one.

It's armour where Russian weaponry is currently falling very short. A lot of it, particularly the IFVs and APCs, and to a lesser extent the tank models, all falls victim to a deeply embedded design decision that underpins all the prominent vehicle families. It's most visible in the BMP lineage but it extends to the BTR and BRDM families too. All are designed to be NBC-resistant first and conventionally armoured second. There's a nice Galeev thread about the BMP specifically but this is a deep rooted problem that upgrades and iterative development won't fix. The designs and platforms are fundamentally flawed from the ground up.

The trucks: outdated garbage across the board with ancient designs pushed well beyond their service lives. The Ural is a usable relic with major fuel consumption issues, and even the KAMAZ shows its age. Everything else is long obsolete entirely.

Newer, truly post Soviet stuff, clean break design platforms, are generally not being built in any kind of quantity. The one I'd concede is actually not half bad is the GAZ Tigr although it's still a bit old in its philosophy. Against the HMMWV, sure, it looks good, but against a current gen Western MRAP it's a bit of an oddity.

The conclusion/tl;dr: it's not all terrible but Russian weaponry really suffers simply from inconsistency, and availability of the modern designs. You can buy a lot of Russian equipment, you can actually buy genuinely good Russian equipment, but it's tough to buy a lot of good equipment. The one saving grace of the export markets like India is they can cherry pick only the good stuff if they choose. The downside is India needs more than the available quantities of only the ""good stuff"".",1649331384.0,1649331202.0,t3_ty4fx4,t1_i3qy7oo,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

Cutting the supply from Russia would remove 55% of Germany's imports. Germany currently has enough reserves to last several months without Russia. With LNG imports from the US Germany could last longer. If Germany cut back on some production it could last much longer. Germany could set up government funding to pay a normal wage for those that lose their job. Germany would be out of that money plus the money they should get from the taxes of the products that they would have usually produced. It should be possible without major loss to push Germany's natural gas supply out to about a year.

In that time Germany could start working to convert some of their natural gas power plants to coal. I know that is going in the opposite direction for clean energy but if Germany wants to get off Russian resources it would be a useful step in the right direction. During the year Germany could put effort into switching the heat generation in the country to electrical. Building up solar and wind. Germany also has a decent amount of natural gas reserves.

Both Destroyers and Battleships were used in shore-bombardment campaigns in practice. But IIRC, the Navy most preferred Cruisers.

-------

Look at a typical car. Now fill that car with explosives. That's roughly what a Battleship shell looked like. Battleship guns were so absurdly large that you no longer have cost-effectiveness in the operation. The ammunition was so large and heavy that the turrets would be ""worn out"" after relatively few shots (ie: the recoil slowly warps the barrels, causing their accuracy to degenerate)

----

The point of Battleships was to go far beyond the ""cost-effectiveness"" point of guns. Bigger guns mean bigger range (more explosives per shell, and more mass, so drag has less of an effect on the shells. Surface-area grows quadratically, but mass/momentum grows cubic). Since you have a bit more range than the opponent, you get ""first strike"" with Battleships.

+ Russia is the one needing to operate logistics and bases in a hostile country. This is a big part of why they're losing so hard. Move the fight to Russia and they can rely on railway logistics, cached supplies, and dug-in defences.

+ A lot of international support concerns Ukrainian self-defence. NATO countries supplying arms that are being used to invade Russia is a lot less palatable.

+ Russia committing crimes against Ukrainian civilians is a very different deal from Russia committing crimes against Russian civilians in a scorched-earth retreat.

+ They'd have to fight multiple fronts or stretch themselves thin. Russia is just... big. Ukraine would have to think hard about which direction their push would be in and how it wouldn't expose them to a counterattack on another front. If Ukraine pushed north-east from Kyiv through the gap between Sumy and Chernihiv towards Bryansk and on to Moscow, they'd leave big gaps for a Russian counteroffensive from Krasnodar or Rostov. Same is true in reverse. If they attack both they'd be splitting their forces.

I don't know what the ""out"" would be if Russia was driven from Ukraine but didn't give up. I think that there are some plausible limited offensive options that don't ruffle all the feathers, e.g. a push to take Belgorod given that it was, historically, Ukrainian, or to slice off the tip of Russia from Rostov over to where the Volga runs into the Caspian Sea as a decapitation move against a Russian recapture of Crimea.

crimea can be attacked for sure, especially if ukranians are getting drone replenishments from turkey and the USA.   realistically what defenses do you think would be there to stop a ukranian artillery and infantry assault.   

russia has mostly tanks and artillery, so that would get blown up by drones and ukranian artillery if they stick it on the border

most of their battlegroups are at a minimum damaged from extended combat operations inside ukraine itself, so it would not be a large force of troops defending it.   ukranian troops are better than russian troops anyway

mines and barbed wire would slow them down but not stop an assault completely

so that leaves mainly air power and sea power, if ukraine can attack the airfields and neutralize their ships then that doesn't leave much in the way of defenses.  there's a choke point on the russian end that could be used to prevent reinforcement from that direction

I believe Russia has earned it's hostile treatment here, and in the west in general. All they had to do was NOT invade another country that didn't want them there. It's vile in the same way Nazi Germany is looked at as vile. 

Germany and the west were not hostile to eachother, and even worked together. Berlin held the olympics. But when Germany invaded Poland, it doesn't really matter how close they were. I bet if you asked people's opinion on Nazi germany before the war, many would think favorably. 

Similar to Russia today. I'm Canadian. I didn't hate Russia. I thought it was a cool country, and I really wanted to see it become a rich prosperous country and not be enemies. Half the NHL is Russian, and Ovechkin is my favorite player. The western public literally didn't really care about Russia that much. We didn't hate them, we just felt they were behind in a lot of ways. Most didn't view Russia as a threat, and a lot were happy to see they recovered from the post soviet collapse. I'm sure if you had asked a lot of people before this, many would have loved to visit Russia and further relations. 

Now? Not so much. For example as a Canadian, USA is our closest ally and neighbor. But if the USA suddenly announced that a Canadian province would be holding a referendum to join the states and sent ""peacekeepers"", we would feel the same as Ukrainians. If they invaded and tried to take Ottawa, we would fight them with everything.

Because if you want to get along with other countries, you have to let them be free. NATO is a good example. It's entirely up to a country whether it joins or not, and it's a defensive alliance. It doesn't mean Poland is now part of the USA, it means they help each other. It's an alliance between free countries. 

Russia never seemed to have learned this, and has demonstrated it has no interest in free countries. Which is why we now hate Russia.  If Russia had it's own version of NATO and UA voluntarily joined while remaining it's own country, the west would not care.

But when you rig foreign elections, invade, slaughter, rape, say you must eradicate any thought and supporter who thinks ukraine should be it's own country... the west will not stand by and let you do your best Hitler cosplay. I'm sure many Russians don't support it, and are good people. But it seems there are enough who do that   it's easy to call Russia an evil country. This isn't ""just a few bad apples"", this is a full scale invasion supported by a seeming majority of Russians. 

Don't make the mistake of assuming EVERY story has two sides, and the truth is somewhere in the middle. Sometimes, the truth is only on one side. 

The west isn't pushing state sponsored false narratives, using actors to fake Russian war crimes, covering up the fact that some Azov members are neonazi's. The west isn't locking up anybody who publishes real photos or protests. The west hasn't shut down every media outlet that tells a different story. Only Russia has done that. 

There's a reason Russia has gone to such extreme measure to keep people from knowing the truth. It's because they are lying. Every bit of official media in Russia is first filtered by the Kremlin. There are no ""independent journalists"", as they have been forced to suspend operations or leave the country. You can't even view footage or social media posts from REAL PEOPLE in ukraine without a VPN. 

One side is fabricated, the other is not. 

It's simple. Everything goes away if you just leave other countries alone to do what they choose. That's all Russia ever needed to do. Ukraine should be free to join eu, free to join NATO, free to join Russia, free to join a Russian alliance. That's their choice. Not the West, not Russia. 

But Russia has taken that choice away. Because allowing a country to be free is apparently such a big threat that they will slaughter cities just to prevent it. And to the west, that's evil. So don't be surprised when the west hates Russia, because all you had to do to stop it was nothing but apparently even that was too much.

>On Feb. 28, the Central Bank of Russia increased interest rates to 20%. Any Russian who might have been tempted to sell their rubles and buy dollars or euros now has a big incentive to save that money instead. The fewer rubles that go up for sale, the less downward pressure there is on the currency.
  
>Next comes a government requirement on Russian businesses that 80% of any money that those businesses make overseas has to be swapped into rubles. This means that a Russian steelmaker that makes 100 million euros selling steel to a company in France has to turn around and change 80 million of those euros into rubles, regardless of the exchange rate. A lot of Russian companies are doing a lot of business with foreign companies, making a lot of euros, dollars and yen. The order to convert 80% of those revenues into rubles creates significant demand for the Russian currency, thus helping to prop it up.
  
>The Kremlin also issued an edict banning Russian brokers from selling securities owned by foreigners. Many foreign investors own Russian corporate shares and government bonds, and they might understandably want to sell those securities. By banning those sales, the government is shoring up both the stock and bond markets and keeping money inside the country, all of which helps keep the ruble from falling.
   
>Russian citizens themselves have been targeted by the government, which has restricted them from transferring money abroad. The initial ban said all foreign exchange loans and transfers were to be suspended. This served to keep foreign currency in the country and discourage Russians from selling rubles for dollars or euros, which would put pressure on the currency. Those restrictions have been eased somewhat recently to give breathing room to Russians who regularly send money abroad, but conversions of hard currency are limited to just $10,000 for individuals through the end of this year.

 >Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial, and religious groups from a given area, with the intent of making a region ethnically homogeneous. Along with direct removal, extermination, deportation or population transfer, it also includes indirect methods aimed at forced migration by coercing the victim group to flee and preventing its return, such as murder, rape, and property destruction. It constitutes a crime against humanity and may also fall under the Genocide Convention, even as ethnic cleansing has no legal definition under international criminal law.
 
**[Cultural genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_genocide)** 
 
 >Cultural genocide or cultural cleansing is a concept which was proposed by lawyer Raphael Lemkin in 1944 as a component of genocide. Though the precise definition of cultural genocide remains contested, the Armenian Genocide Museum defines it as ""acts and measures undertaken to destroy nations' or ethnic groups' culture through spiritual, national, and cultural destruction"". Some ethnologists, such as Robert Jaulin, use the term ethnocide as a substitute for cultural genocide, although this usage has been criticized as risking the confusion between ethnicity and culture.

 >An active protection system is a system (usually for a military application) designed to prevent anti-tank missiles/projectiles from acquiring and/or destroying a target. Electronic countermeasures that alter the electromagnetic, acoustic or other signature(s) of a target thereby altering the  tracking and sensing behavior of an incoming threat (e. g. , guided missile) are designated soft-kill measures ie SKAPS.

Again, most of the non-Russian arms manufacturers would rather not sell arms to Russia. Almost every nation with a reasonable military industry other than Russia and China is not aligned with Russia: US, UK, Canada dominate the global arms industry, all very obviously would say no. The majority of the rest of the list of significant arms producers also would be unlikely to agree: Australia, Belgium, Czechia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwain, Turkey, Ukraine... it really doesn't look good for Russia. They really stand quite alone right now.

I guess someone like Norinco might, from China, but even private Chinese companies wouldn't want to be seen supplying Russia right now.

The exceptions, major arms producing nations that would not just nope out: 

+ Brazil have a decent arms industry and have been very quiet. That's an option. Particularly when it comes to aviation, Brazil could have something Russia wants.

+ India also tick some of the boxes in that although they're not running a huge arms surplus, they have a lot of production licences and technology transfer agreements with Russia and consequently they have a lot of Russian (and ex-Soviet) pattern equipment in service.

This is the problem, Ukraine has the industry of the world behind it, Russia is, like the Nazis in 1944, suddenly finding that it's simply being outproduced where it matters. Russia is definitely having issues with personnel when it comes to the infantry, but when you look at the air force, the issue there is not a pilot shortage but an airframe shortage - they don't have backups for combat damaged aircraft even those that aren't combat losses.

Hypothetically, I think an assault on Crimea would take place only after other areas of Ukraine were fully held, and would perhaps look like this:

1. Ukrainian drones, missiles, and SEAD pilots target anti-air systems within range of Crimea. Ukraine has been saving its air force for something by playing so conservatively with how often and how riskily they fly - this might be why. Simultaneously, AShMs deal with elements of the Russian navy that move within attack distance, after all, Russia is down to just its Black Sea fleet in the area now. 

2. Ukrainian ground attack aircraft, with fighter cover, or missile units, strike identified Russian artillery positions in Crimea, as well as destroying the bridge across from mainland Russia.

3. With control of the air, Russian reinforcements cut off, and the majority of artillery neutralised, Ukrainian ground forces begin their assault. Any surviving artillery is quickly located and destroyed.

4. Demoralised, out of resources, and utterly shattered from previous withdrawals back to Crimea, Russian forces capitulate and surrender within 24 hours.

The general opinion of the world will be ""You lost, accept it"" and I agree, I can see more sympathy for a Ukrainian offensive into Russia if Russia refuses to stop fighting (and remains potent).

I don't see a full scale march on Moscow happening, I see Russia capitulating at some point. I will admit I am still a little on the fence as to whether that point will be before or after Russia is driven out of Ukraine.

Based on current information, I expect Ukraine to win this war. I expect them to insist on that victory including Ukrainian sovereignty over Donbas and Crimea in full. I think that increased demand is now a near-certainty post-Bucha. Where they might have settled for less a week ago, the atrocities that Russia has committed seem to have burned all bridges towards a Russia-favouring compromise. It's fairly clear that Ukraine will now stop at nothing short of total recapture of its rightful lands.

What's not as clear is how that's reached. Three scenarios:

1. Russia could surrender (or withdraw) *before* Ukraine's victory is achieved militarily, though I don't see them handing over Crimea without being pushed out or their armed forces being destroyed. It's possible that before Ukrainian troops clear all of Ukraine, Russia could simply collapse militarily, surrender, and then Ukraine mops up the mess. 

2. If there's no military collapse, Russia could be driven back over all Ukrainian borders and call it a day. 

3. It could keep going further by refusing to surrender at that point and forcing Ukraine to make decisions about moving into Russian territories.

I think, perhaps, like you, the scenario I don't fully see working is the one we're talking about - Scenario 2. In that, Russia is driven over a border it doesn't believe in, and just what? Stops? That seems improbable. I think a victory comes from scenarios 1 and 3 only.

The question is really whether Ukraine demolishes them before scenario 3 happens and they surrender, or after that if they don't, and how far Russia is prepared to go with this. I could see a Ukrainian capture of a substantial border city being the Russian surrender point. Failing that, I could see a slicing of Russia from Rostov to the Caspian Sea being the ""easiest"" strategic victory for Ukraine in forcing a Russian surrender. After all, the total loss of the Azov Sea *and* their ports on the Black Sea, would be a huge issue for Russia.

a6eabe054086acb2122a1ec1bdfd6e38,ty4fx4,i3st1rw,"You are missing a couple key things.

1. First, I have followed it for more than a year including in 2014.

2. This was a soft revolution in 2014, after which an election was held. That was the will of the people. He was not ""overthrown and replaced"", he resigned in disgrace, fled to Russia (where he hangouts with Putin himself), and Ukraine held a FREE election that reflected the will of the people. UA wanted to be closer with EU than Russia. Yanukovych unilaterally declared the opposite would happen, made protesting the decision illegal, then killed the protestors. It was not a coup. The definition of a coup is ""it is an illegal seizure of power by a political faction, rebel group, military, or a dictator"". A coup is what Russia had planned for day 3 of the invasion, where the elected (Zelensky) leader would be removed by military force and replaced with a puppet leader who would do what Russia wanted (Yanukovych). 

3. Russia cannot be surprised that the government is hostile to Russia, as the point of the revolution was to be closer to the west and lest we forget RUSSIA ALREADY INVADED UKRAINE IN 2014. What do you expect, ""Oh geeze, thanks for invading you guys! After controlling our government indirectly for years, we must thank you for now moving troops and annexing our territory once we actually become a free country"". That's Russian fiction. 

4. It's seen as unavoidable because the Kremlin wants it to be seen that way. They won't ever let people see the 1001 ways it could have been avoided. Neonazi's are just a distraction. Ukraine is hostile simply because Russia invaded, threatened to invade further, and then invaded. There are as many Neo Nazis in any country as there are in ua. There was no threat to Russian security in the same way Switzerland is not a threat to Nato. That's entirely made up. Russia could have chosen to work with Ukraine, instead they chose to work against. Of course, that's not something any Russian media will tell you. They will just say whatever they want, true or not, to make people believe their insane stories. They were CAUGHT staging videos of fake ua troops shooting a prisoner, and said it was news. Do people in Russia know it was fake, because everything is made up? Probably not. 

5. There was no sucker punch coming. Ukraine had been invaded, and expected (rightfully, as we now know) to be invaded again. How can people believe this? If Finland annexed St petersberg, do you think the Russian government would be hostile to finland? What if the russian government said ""We never want st petersberg to happen again, so we are taking steps to strengthen our military so finland could never invade again"". Should finland first strike you because of your ""sudden aggression and hostility towards finland"" Are you now Nazi's who need liberation by finland? No, of course not. If finland decides to invade anyways because ""pro finnish"" Russians that they secretly support ""need their help for liberation from the Russian Nazi's"", are they right? no. If they kill thousands, children, civilians, hospitals, schools, kill anyone suspected of being ""russian sympathizers"", all men age 16-50, in their hunt for these ""russian nazi's""... wouldn't they be the Nazi's? Yes. 
6. There are many Russians in Donetsk and Luhansk. True. And they were free to be there until their country invaded. Russia has treated UA like garbage for years, invaded them, rigged their elections, sabotaged them, killed them. What do you expect? They just roll over and let Russia fuck them?

7. Canada has the third largest UA population in the world. My grandparents are also eastern european, and fled Russia. We are taking refugees. I know people in the ua foreign legion. We are giving equipment. If it were up to me, we would be sending troops and blowing migs out of the sky. This directly concerns my country as a dictatorship has tried to stop another country from joining an alliance we are part of with military force. Russia has threatened my country. Russia flies bombers over my country. Russia meddles in my countries elections. The difference is, we are free. We don't get spoonfed our carefully crafted lies straight from the government. My leader doesn't execute or jail his opponents. My country did not invade ukraine and lie about it. Why would the west trust Russia on LITERALLY ANYTHING when every single time they just lie? ""We won't invade"" ""we aren't invading"" ""We aren't in western ukraine"" ""We are treating civilians with respect"". When you do the opposite EVERY. SINGLE. TIME, people aren't going to believe you. I view Russia as a threat to ua, europe, nato, Canada, and the free world. Because they have proven they are. Nobody in the west wants to invade Russia. Literally no one. They just don't want Russia invading them, and Russia has time and time again stated they will invade people and then follow through. Maybe the one thing we can believe them on. 

8. Regardless, this is disastrous for Russia. They are losing a war they thought they would take 2 days. With you having access to the free internet, I'm sure you also realize nobody is scared of Russia's conventional army after this. 30 years of good will and relations pissed into the wind for a dictators pipe dream. Believe me when I say barely anyone viewed Russia negatively before this. Years of cold war tensions FINALLY were dissolving, trade and travel were more or less free. Our militaries even trained together. Hell, if Russia's stories were ACTUALLY true that Ukraine was a dictatorship imminently about to invade and slaughter Moscow, the west would have HELPED Russia.

The question of ""should the French Fifth Republic inherit the seat of the French Fourth Republic"" is quite different from ""should Russia take the seat of the USSR"".

The first situation, there's a single clear successor and continuous line of governance. There is no fragmentation, no additional party with a claim to be the successor, old France is replaced exactly with new France. There's no question that they are the seat holder. There's no need to vote on it. Arguably if that was how it worked, the UK would have to rejoin every time it held a general election as it dissolves itself and reforms a parliament every time.

Russia automatically taking the USSR seat is not the same. Russia wasn't the only successor because the USSR didn't just reform, it broke apart. Every single successor state could place a claim to be the successor. Russia made the claim as the largest and the holder of the old capital but there's no reason that automatically grants them the seat. They weren't the last to leave the USSR. They didn't instigate the breakup either. They just went along with it and assumed they'd be given the inheritance.

Ukraine could claim it, Tajikistan could claim it, heck, Transinistria could claim it.

I'm not saying Russia has a weak claim, I'm just saying their current claim is based upon the presumption that inheritance is automatically theirs and the assumption that they're the only ones with a legitimate claim.

Militarily, NATO and particularly the US could respond by sending much more substantial materiel to Ukraine such as heavy armoured vehicles or offensive weaponry, could resume air force training to migrate UAF pilots onto F-15s, could start lend-leasing current service equipment rather than donating close-to-current-generation resources (the Javelins and NLAWs are current but the exact ones being sent are older stockpiles and earlier revisions), and even start putting boots on the ground in Western Ukraine to free up Ukrainian forces to move East.

Economically, EU and US could not just sanction China but cut back on trade across key Chinese industries, and immediately halt exports to China of all goods. China is experiencing a middle class boom right now, with a rapid growth in the number of well-educated, more liberal, more affluent citizens. 

Politically, this has consequences, because a middle class growth means a new type of citizen making up the core of your society.

Unlike Russia where there are huge swathes of population still living like that (and who don't really have the awareness of the world to understand that their children are being called up for war), China risks serious internal unrest moving to such a war footing.

2. Soft revolution. What is the difference between overthrowing the existing government, removing the existing ruling party and that ""soft revolution"" you speak of? The currently elect president had to flee to avoid being executed, the ruling party either all getting scared off, jailed or executed and replaced by the powers sponsoring or directly helping with that ""soft revolution"". If there was such a thing as ""expressing people's will"" during elections, there would have been a patient awaiting of next elections without resorting to what happened in 2014. Like it happens in all democratic countries. As bad as Trump was, he wasn't in any threat of being killed or jailed before his term ended. You can't just remove an existing president by force, and THEN hold an election to call that ""the will of the people"". You just cut off anyone voting for Yanukovitch, ridding them of their ""choice"" that they made during last election, and redid the election like nothing happened. That is not how things work, I hope you realize that.

3. In a vacuum, if Russia randomly annexed Crimea and then the government suddenly turned hostile, yes, it would be nonsensical to believe that the country wouldn't be hostile. However, the annexation happened during the time period when Yanukovitch fled, but before the ""new elections"".

4. There is absolutely a threat. Watch any neutral, non Russian view on the NATO-Russia conflict and how it continuously expanded east despite the promise made during soviet union collapse. The terrain of the Eurasia, and how much easier it is to defend against military expansion at the borders of Soviet Union as opposed to borders of current Russian Federation. How devastating NATO based weapons would be on Ukrainian territory. It's not just about Ukraine threatening to invade Russia. It's the prospect of anti-russia military force based on Russian borders and how easy it would be to defend against it. The military logistics.

5. Ukraine, in the past few months prior to Russia entering its territory, has been massively and rapidly increasing military spending and military size. We are talking 40 or 60% increase within months. They were also amassing military presence on the borders of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which were at that time contested and had some tensions already. There is no denying that they were preparing for some massive scale attack. It wasn't a gradual build up. Take these two regions, next in line is Crimea, with active Russian military presence. The reasoning is clear: ""we take back what is ours."" It wouldn't stop at Donestsk and Lugansk. There is absolutely no denying that, unless you're willing to argue that.

6. Donetsk and Lugansk arguably been in military conflict with current UA government for years following the ""revolution"". Before the Russian ""invasion"". You can argue that it's already been invaded but it's a known fact that locals have been fighting there far before Russian military stepped in, due to the existing tensions.

7. I assume this is to address my ""you have little interest in the conflict"" point. You already proven that you've followed it before, but fact still stands that you talk about this in a global sense. Bombs aren't a ""slip"" away from starting to fall on your head. Your military isn't engaged in active conflict about 2000 kilometers away from your home. It's happening across the ocean. For me this is a bit more personal. More real. Closer.

So you're repeating ""symbols"" again? Come on. Are biker gangs German nationalists because they wear Iron Crosses?

> Would you defend a Russian carrying a Z patch as not really supporting the invasion because symbols have no meaning?

The difference is _that Z is painted on the actual artillery pieces and tanks_ that right now are firing into hospitals and shelling women and children. You really can't see the difference? There is an active army (Russian) currently wearing Z symbols and committing massive war crimes.

I was just asking for the details of how these kinds of deals worked and the possible ramifications of this continued support, as opposed to actual involvement, if it became possible. All I said was that, from my admittedly ignorant perspective, I felt like Ukraine was being given way more equipment than I realized was necessary for what they were doing. That's part of the problem of getting most of this news in a bubble, where 99 percent of the news I see is about how Ukraine is either obliterating Russia on a scale that nobody thought possible, or how X country has agreed to supply them with (insert huge number of supplies/weapons here).

Revolution, is the people removing a leader and choosing a new one. Which ukraine did. There is no comparison between USA here, because the USA actually has free elections. In Russia, any opposition party with even a remote chance of success is labelled terrorist or are arrested. Remember when Navalny was poisoned? Then arrested for leaving the country in a coma, unconscious,  for medical treatment in Germany? Then sentenced to another 9 for people protesting his poisoning? You could bet if that was the case in the states, there would be revolution. 

 3 - So they invaded and annexed it. 
>Whilst the ""little green men"" were occupying the Crimean parliament building, the parliament held an emergency session.[131][132] It voted to terminate the Crimean government, and replace Prime Minister Anatolii Mohyliov with Sergey Aksyonov.[133] Aksyonov belonged to the Russian Unity party, which received 4% of the vote in the last election

-wiki

Not to mention, the official russian ""tally"" of the votes was 95% for Russia (Actual estimates are 15-30%). I mean, if you are okay with holding elections in other countries at gunpoint I'm okay with the USA taking the Kremlin and holding an ""Emergency Moscow referendum"". Where politicians (under the watchful eye of US spefial forces) can vote if they want to join America or not. 

That's not a vacuum, those are reasons given to your own people so they don't think you are fascist authoritarians (which russia is)
 
 4 -  What conflict? There was no conflict. The only conflict is that which Russia has created. Nato is a voluntary defense alliance. Countries can join or not join. A country joining Nato is not conflict. Now, all the rest will join NATO because it's clear that if you aren't in it, Russia will invade you. I believe you are referring to the budapest memorandum... which Russia and USA agreed to...
1. Respect Belarusian, Kazakh and Ukrainian independence and sovereignty in the existing borders.[24]
1. Refrain from the threat or the use of force against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.
1. Refrain from using economic pressure on Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine to influence their politics.
1. Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine if they ""should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used"".
1.  Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against Belarus, Kazakhstan or Ukraine.
Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments.[20][25]

Maybe you need to be reminded who it was who broke that agreement. 

5- yeah duh. Because Russia had invaded, was funding and fighting with separatists, and outright said they would invade. Which they did. So they were right. There's nothing to invade, because Donbas is part of Ukraine. An attack would be an attack on Belgograd, which by the way... has anyone asked if they want to join ua? ""Poland amassed troops right where we were going to invade... so clearly they were going to attack us"" - Nazi germany.
What should they do, give Russia a red carpet into the country and not respond to the buildup of Russian forces? They should take back Donbas and Crimea, because it's theirs. That's not an attack on Russia. It's not ua moving to the Russian border, it's the Russian border moving to them.

6 - Donbas is just Crimea with extra steps. The ""definitely not russian"" rebels in this case, couldn't cut the region off from the rest of the country like they could with crimea so they had to actually fight. 

7 - Bombs are the same difference from both of us, unless you live on a russian military base on the border. Also may I remind you Russia flew ARMED nukes over sweden, and regularly flies into our airspace . In fact, we are worried Russia is going to ""crimea"" our north. So we purchased 85 f-35s, and have increased our military spending directly to ""counter the russian threat in the north"". Not sure you've looked at a globe recently, but we can literally walk into eachothers countries. 

8- Yep. All Russia had to do was NOT go full Nazi Germany, and it we probably would eventually be united as equals and partners. Oh well. If there's one thing the west can always unite behind, it's fighting Nazi's. At least Russia's downfall is bringing us the unity we've been missing! Also interesting to note, Canada had a somewhat similar group of separatists in the 70s from quebec who wanted to leave. We worked it out, and the terrorists were dealt with after murdering politicians. If the states had offered to provide arms to quebec separatists, you could bet your ASS we would have built up troops and increased our spending.

>Meduza obtained files containing high-quality videos depicting the southern districts of the city of Bucha, Kiev region. The recording was made from a drone. According to the file metadata, these videos were filmed over several days, from March 23 to 30, 2022 (read more below). The recordings that we are publishing are another very important piece of evidence (along with satellite imagery in  The New York Times ), which shows that people in Bucha were definitely killed even before the Russian troops retreated from the city.
>
>In several videos, next to the bodies (at a distance of several tens to several hundred meters), you can see military equipment similar to the equipment used by Russian airborne units (probably BMD and BTR-D). On one of the recordings, people can be distinguished next to one of these combat vehicles. At this time, the bodies of the dead continue to lie a few tens of meters from the location of the military.  
>
>Why are we sure that the video was made before the arrival of Ukrainian troops?
>
>Three main arguments allow us to confidently assert that the video that we are publishing was filmed before the Russian troops retreated from Bucha:  
first of all, Russian military equipment is clearly visible on Yablonskaya Street, and on several shootings and on different days. Several armored vehicles are there on the 23rd and up to the 28th of March. In the video, dated March 29, Russian equipment is no longer on the street. Such equipment is not in service with the Ukrainian army.
>
> Secondly, the source provided us with raw, original drone video files. These files contain detailed metadata, including data on the time of shooting.
>
>Third, since metadata can be faked if desired, we engaged two independent experts who checked the shooting time using astronomical shadow analysis on the image. Its results confirmed that the time in the metadata matches the actual time of filming, and the first video of the dead could not be filmed after March 26, 2022.

Again, you seem to be missing the point. Poorly maintained Russian equipment with poorly trained Russian soldiers, with bad tactics is fairing poorly. Ukrainian owned Russian equipment maintained well, with well trained soldiers, is fairing well. I'm not saying it's great, it's cheap and effective **if maintained well and used with properly trained troops**. Compare that to expensive and very effective western equipment. It's just not accurate to say Russian equipment is useless or worthless as the OP claims.

Also I forgot to mention that Stingers and other MANPADS are only for low altitude targets. The mobile SAMs for high altitude targets that Ukraine is using are completely Russian made. So not all defense is related to Western equipment.

You're right that was the wrong link.

But it is a total waste of time if you:

* deny that Ukraine's offensive weapons are all Russian
* deny that Ukraine mobile SAMs are Russian made
* refuse to accept that Ukraine is conducting a counter offensive
* refuse to accept that Russian equipment is solid with proper training, tactics, and maintenance.
