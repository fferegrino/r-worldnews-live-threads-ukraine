Day 282-283 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet both today and yesterday, but there were some missile launches from Belgorod a couple of times, and it looks like they were targeting Kupiansk yet again. The new big missile strike still hasn’t happened yet, but today they did fly their strategic bombers around the usual missile launch positions just to intimidate us. Right now our officials are predicting that they are waiting for it to get colder before striking our energy infrastructure again, so that civilians would suffer more.

The situation with electricity is getting a bit better in Kharkiv; we are back to the usual scheduled blackouts instead of emergency ones, and some days there are no blackouts at all, at least for our building. People from our district were complaining a lot about uneven blackouts in a public group chat, and it looks like it might have actually worked, because there was someone from our city’s energy company in that chat and he knew why the blackouts were uneven and talked about it. 

After that the blackouts actually became much more even, now pretty much every building gets blackouts and they are shorter for everyone because of that. So either that person relayed the complaints and they fixed it because of that, or they were already working on it and it just lined up incidentally, but it’s much better now either way.

I didn’t post anything yesterday because I caught some weird flu-like virus and couldn’t even stand up for some time, but whatever that virus was it basically cycled through every flu symptom within 24 hours and now it’s already basically gone, just some coughing and mild weakness left, so I’m back to writing my updates.

>This was stated by the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Vadym Skibitskyi.

> ""This suggests that some missiles are used directly from the assembly line. How many of them will be enough depends on the production.

>Yes, it fell compared to the pre-war period. But, unfortunately, due to the fact that it circumvents economic sanctions, the Russian Federation is still able to produce a certain number of cruise missiles and other weapons that are used against our state,"" Skibitskyi said.

I understand that Ukraine is fighting a just war and that Russia is the aggressor, but that is no reason to celebrate the loss of life. I mourn every Russian life lost just as much as every Ukrainian life lost. Every life lost on either side represents a family robbed of their son or daughter and a community robbed of one of their rocks. 

Like I said Russia is the unjustified aggressor, people are right to root for Ukraine. However, I pray that people don’t succumb to bloodlust and throw away their humanity in doing so. 

Cheering for a soldier’s death even if that solider is fighting for the unjust side is horrific. Afterall, it’s widely agreed upon that the Iraq war was unjustified, but cheering the deaths of American or British troops would be rightfully condemned.

Western governments are going to sell seized yachts and privates jets and give the proceeds to Ukraine. We can help Ukraine by taking this a step further. What if we buy and commercialize these assets and make Ukraine profit from them? They'll have a long term source of revenue from this in addition to the initial sale. Even if it's just a few hundred thousand per year, that can still be useful to rebuild a bunch of stuff in Ukraine.

Russia's current endgame is clearly to maintain a stalled frontline until Ukraine is forced to give up and let them have the currently occupied territories.

Which is also why *Russia* has been clamouring for peace negotiations or a truce, as they can paint Ukraine as ""unreasonable"" for not agreeing to the major territorial losses etc. as a condition for peace. While in the meantime Russia has already stated that demanding it to withdraw to pre-2014 borders as a condition for peace is ""unreasonable"" and they will never agree to it, which tells as to how they view the negotiations.",False,1670080634.0,t3_zb73l8,t1_iyr5a0i,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Russian diplomacy, take what isn't yours, demand more. Russia is hoping that international support wanes, and nations drive Ukraine to the table and force over the land that Russia has claimed. Russia will use that as the starting point for 'talks' and then demand more territory, potentially half of Ukraine, in the hopes that 'negotiations' gives them half of that.

That gives them a net gain of a couple of hundred thousand kilometres of fertile, resource filled land. Putin doesn't care about the dead soldiers, hell half of them are guys he would happily put into concentration camps.


Talks start? Russia gets time to rearm and resupply.

Talks go well? Russia takes a huge amount of land.

Talks go badly? Russia paints Ukraine as the baddy for not wanting peace.


But their plan has a problem... A lot of nations really fucking hate Putin and are tired of Russia's shit. So the step-1 part isn't getting off the ground.

Finland has security concerns as a it borders Russia, Russia has security concerns as it borders NATO, china and has a massive land border that is theoretically to large and flat  to defend

Russias geographical position has long been uneasy, and going into the future a resolution to the conflict absolutely should  include reasonable and sane concerns to Russia's security. Especially as some of that security pertains to their massive nuclear arsenal that the whole world benefits in keeping safe and secure.

**But no where in that is the case that Russia's security was ever truly at threat from Ukraine, only the other way around.** If Macron tries to pull some nonsense that Russia should get to keep Ukrainian land, or bar them from joining NATO, or demilitarize them in anyway Ukraine should never agree to those terms at all. Ukraine should

1) be in NATO and the EU as fast as possible 

2) keep a large standing army, likely the largest in Europe

3) return all of its land to it, including Crimea

4) get a demilitarized zone on its border with Russia and Belarus. 

What would Russia's legitimate security concerns be? Probably keeping the black sea fleet in the black sea, retaining access to the Bosporus through Turkey for trade, help from other countries safe guarding its nuclear stockpile, reasonable trade that allows to maintain at least some form of a modern military.

Abusers will use any means to get advantage in a situation. In this case Russia will continue to lob missiles while lying to justify their actions, saying they are forced to do what they do. They, you see, are actually the victims and it's all NATOs fault. 

So what to do? Shoot down every missile and get on with life. To use the language of psychology, set a boundary and never waiver from it. It the missiles aren't effective any more they will stop using them and switch to something else, looking for something that works. But notice as well the progress than has been made on the information side of the war, and that by getting out in front of Putin's lies the West has effectively defused their power. The world is beginning to see the Russian bullshit for what it is: lies and stealing. 

This is good news. Russia will be defeated in the end by their own lies, corruption and incompetence. But because the national personality disorder that is the Russian state will continue to seek effective means at global power projection they will adapt to whatever works best. Eventually they will decide terrorist tactics aren't effective, if every time they use them it makes their situation worse. So far that is the strategy and it takes time. When they decide that terrorism isn't the way they will deny they ever did anything wrong and, that there ever was a problem, or even, likely, a war... and then do something else. 

When they actually decide to do something else we should allow them their fiction, within reason, and let them not be terrorists. This won't happen soon or anything, but ultimately it's the way out.

It's a personality disorder, and should be treated as such. But there's been a lot of good and effective thinking on how to do that, so that's good news.",False,1670080305.0,t3_zb73l8,t1_iyqgb3f,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

With genocide and attempt to wipe away Ukrainian identity? 

When the hell will it stop? When will west realize that Russia have been given ALL chances, all accommodations. West opened their markets for them, showered them with money, every firm opened up in Russia, western firms build so many factories, invested so much in them. They had SO MANY opportunities given to them. Fuck they even got a slot in G7, and it turned in to G8. Just for them. 

And they threw it all away. They threw all that good will away, and shown that they have learned nothing. Russia have learned nothing! I doubt they will ever learn.

Government warns us that next blackout can be a long one. People are preparing hard for it, and are waiting, because it means that we are going to be without heat and water for weeks in a dead of winter.

Everyone is anxious, everyone is preparing, but we know that it’s impossible to prepare for everything. It is also impossible to know when light will be on next time, or when it will be gone. We live under CONSTANT threat of rocket attacks from Russia. They have been terrorizing us with them for OVER NINE MONTHS. 

And as the entire world watches Ukraine preparing and fighting off darkness what do we hear? ""Security guarantees for Russia!"". What the actual fuck?!

Despite what some people think, war is not won yet.  

War is not won yet, because I see our people, our best people dying every single day. I see our people tortured, kidnapped, raped, executed by Russians for the fact that they supported Ukraine. We fucking find bodies and torture chambers in almost every other fucking city or village. I see entire cities and villages destroyed, wiped off the map, and only burned away land, and building remain. I wake up every single day and see on the news what else Russians have blown up, who else found dead, and how many people they killed. 

You say Russia losing their children. What children? They are KIDNAPPING kids from Ukraine! They are stealing our children!

Russia HAVE NOT LOST anything of value to them YET. Only their pride have been hurt. Their cities are not getting bombed (ours are), their lands are not scorched and bombarded (ours are), lives of ordinary Russians did not change nearly at all! They are fine with this war. They are fine with what is going on. For them temporary losing some money (which will get unfrozen, and compensated by new contracts after ""peace deal"") means nothing, if they get to get away with this crap yet again. Russia does not think that they are losing. If they ""negotiate"" removal of santions and return to markets, they will quite literally get out scott free, losing only parts of their army, and pride they had.

But they do not want to lose anythign. They are fine with dragging it on. They want to win and capture entire Ukraine. Even now they plan another advance from Belarus, and want to use their forces against us. Russia is not beaten yet. Fight is not done. War is not over.

There's really two different, almost orthogonal kinds of truth. It's not that facts don't matter, but that facts are not the sole origin of ""truth"". There's also the truth of what people believe, the instalment of their worldview, what they have confidence in and what they don't.

It's the thing that says that a fiat currency has reliable value, despite not being backed by anything intrinsic, or the thing that says that a leader has a right to stay in power and have their orders obeyed. It's also the same thing that lets you meet other human beings without immediately fearing they're going to try to attack you.

It's like ""confidence"" or ""mythos"" or ""belief"", but more fundamental. They guide our actions just as much as our factual experiences, like the sky appearing blue. I kinda want to invent a new word for it because no word quite matches with the right subtext.

You're right, though, if everyone believes Putin is dying... he may as well be dying.
