1.) FlightRadar uses ADS-B transponder data, not actual radar.  These transponders transmit an ICAO address to aid in traffic control and flight tracking.  FlightRadar simply uses this public domain data as a service.

2.) Military aircraft will turn on or off an ADS-B transponder based on the needs of the mission- either they're using civilian air corridors for routine flights or they *want* to be seen for any multitude of reasons, both benign and less-than.  Actual shoot-em-up missions will NOT be on FlightRadar.

3.) It's a fun time-kill to watch, but remember that routine military missions happen all the time in places you wouldn't expect.

4.) ""BLOCKED"" is almost always an individually owned private jet that needs its ADS-B transponder on to use regular flight routes, but does not want to advertise whose aircraft it is and therefore, who may be on it.

FlightRadar is a neat  diversion even in normal times; please don't try to read anymore into it than what's being shown.  The revolution will not be televised (at least, not on FlightRadar.)

\- China was more critical of Russia than expected, perhaps because they don't want instability now. This also indicates that despite recent news, China may be disapproving of Russian actions behind closed-doors.  
  
\- Ukraine is tip-toeing. They don't want to come off as scared/fearful, but they are being very serious about current Russian actions. In particular, their focus on Russia's domestic recognition of Donbas and surrounding areas was well spoken and important for the record.

""Both Ukraine’s government and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that such a move would effectively amount to a Russian withdrawal from the Minsk Agreements.

The Minsk Agreements — designed to end a separatist war in eastern Ukraine — were signed by representatives for Russia, Ukraine, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and 2015.""


""The U.S. also warned on Wednesday that Moscow may use false claims about the conflict in eastern Ukraine as a pretext for an invasion of the country.

“Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen Russian officials and Russian media plant numerous stories in the press, any one of which could be elevated to serve as a pretext for an invasion,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement on Wednesday.""",1645099760.0,1645099480.0,t3_sukgvr,t3_sukgvr,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

2) The US has not tried to dictate the foreign policy of Mexico in the last 20-30 years. They have no installer puppet governments, they have not tried to assassinate their presidents, they have only strengthened relations by mutual cooperation and trade deals. 
3) If the US had spent the better part of the last century very actively interfering in the affairs of Mexico, stomping on their sovereignty, ect.

I’m afraid it would make no sense for Putin to pull troops back now. Feb 18-20, top US and EU officials gather in Munich with Zelensky. Putin wants them to pressure Ukraine to grant Russian demands. That’s why he would want to keep military pressure high next few days at least.

I know it will be bitter abandoning especially the positions in the east they sacrificed thousands of life capturing in 2014, but trying to fight the Russian overwhelming advantage tanks and artillery in the open field is just a plain waste of young men and women’s lives. I don’t mean to armchair general, but the only way Ukraine is coming out of an open conflict relatively intact is pulling a Finland; making the conflict so prohibitively expensive in money, materiel and lives that the Russian government is willing to negotiate a peace with few to moderate gains. Stock the great cities of the east with supplies to sustain the troops for a long time, turn the concrete jungles into a Stalingradian hell that can act as a force multiplier against Russian air and BLOS firepower superiority. The Russians would be very, very hesitant to pull a Grozny and just flatten a city like Kharkiv or Mariupol to the ground, after all they are supposed to be ""rescuing"" the largely Russian speaking population there. 

In the West, Kiev, Lviv and Odessa will be the main targets of the Russians. While the great Dnieper river shields them from easy assault from the east, if the Russians attack through Belarus or the Pripyat Marshes around Chernobyl, they could threaten these cities too. In that case Kiev might be impossible to hold, and the government would do well to evacuate any key assets, including themselves, from there so the Russians can’t capture them with a lightning strike. Given the emergency requests for equipment they have filed with the international community, that does seem to be their plan, as they have asked for it to be delivered to the town of Kozyn south of Kiev. Sadly, since they only ordered enough emergency housing and boats for about 13,000 people, this likely means they expect to be unable to evacuate much of the capital’s 3 million strong population. 

If I was the Ukrainian Commander-In-Chief, I would shift most of what troops I have to protect Lviv, near the Polish border, and Odessa, Ukraine’s largest port city following the loss of Crimea. These will be the primary arrival points of European or American aid. If they fall, basically the only defensible position Ukraine has left is the Carpathian Mountains in the far West. It is possible the Russians won’t bother attacking the mountains at all if their plan is to set up a puppet government under Akhmetov or some other pro-Russian figure.

> Germany had started a low-intensity undeclared war on Czechoslovakia on 17 September 1938. In reaction, the United Kingdom and France on 20 September formally asked Czechoslovakia to cede its territory to Germany, which was followed by Polish territorial demands brought on 21 September and Hungarian on 22 September. Meanwhile, German forces conquered parts of Cheb District and Jeseník District and briefly overran, but were repelled from, dozens of other border counties. Poland also grouped its army units near its common border with Czechoslovakia and also instigated generally unsuccessful sabotage on 23 September. Hungary also moved its troops towards the border with Czechoslovakia, without attacking.

> An emergency meeting of the main European powers – not including Czechoslovakia, although their representatives were present in the town, or the Soviet Union, an ally to both France and Czechoslovakia – took place in Munich, Germany, on 29–30 September 1938. An agreement was quickly reached on Hitler's terms, being signed by the leaders of Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. The Czechoslovak mountainous borderland that the powers offered to appease Germany had not only marked the natural border between the Czech state and the Germanic states since the early Middle Ages, but it also presented a major natural obstacle to any possible German attack. Having been strengthened by significant border fortifications, the Sudetenland was of absolute strategic importance to Czechoslovakia.

> On 30 September, Czechoslovakia yielded to the combination of military pressure by Germany, Poland and Hungary, and diplomatic pressure by United Kingdom and France, and agreed to give up territory to Germany on Munich terms. Then, on 1 October, Czechoslovakia also accepted Polish territorial demands.

> The Munich Agreement was soon followed by the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938, separating largely Hungarian inhabited territories in southern Slovakia and southern Subcarpathian Rus' from Czechoslovakia. On 30 November 1938 Czechoslovakia ceded to Poland small patches of land in Spiš and Orava regions.

> In March 1939, the First Slovak Republic, a Nazi puppet state, proclaimed its independence. Shortly afterwards, Hitler reneged on his solemn promises to respect the integrity of Czechoslovakia by creating the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, giving Germany full control of what remained of Czechoslovakia, including its significant military arsenal that later played an important role in Germany's invasions of Poland and France. As a result, Czechoslovakia had disappeared.

151a06173fc61b862645adae4ca29edf,sukgvr,hxb1ofb,"Good post, but I think it's work talking MODE-S and Multilateration (MLAT) which is being used extensively for a lot of these tracked flights people think are ""obscured"".

In that case the planes are no longer transmitting detailed information other than aircraft identifier and altitude data.  Even more complicated is that they may not transmit all data 100% of the time, only when interrogated by other aircraft/ground radar - but it's been some time since I knew such things.

Typically this does not transmit your location other than ""close enough to hear the broadcast"" - which is a rather large area.  However, if you have at least 3 Mode-S receivers with very accurate clocks, you can use a technique called multilateration to basically triangulate where an aircraft is based on when the radio messages hit each receiver.

This is the technique seen when the random Learjets are flying through the airspace and all you see is an aircraft type and altitude.

Additionally a lot of the ""omg the plane is abruptly turning!!!111!!!"" stuff is simply an aircraft being out of range of any receivers connected to FR24's network, and FR24 software simply guessing on the plot, then correcting it when it gets real data in.  You can notice this by the little dots on the trail - those are when a receiver has actual data reported to plot on the map.

Even this isn't quite as nuanced as it gets, but you generally will only see military aircraft ""flying silent"" with no mode-s enabled, as it's required by both regulation and TCAS (midair collision avoidance) requires it to function at all.

The fun ones for me are what folks don't typically talk about here.  The tanker in a racetrack pattern over the black sea for example was obviously refueling a number of ""ghosts"" that never showed up on FR24, but the theories here at least were amusing.",1645105715.0,1645105460.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxaxwli,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Militarily? Well in your scenario (full scale), Ukraine would get wrecked (RIP UKRAINE BROS). Ukraine has about 100 planes. Most are bad or old. Russia can launch many times that number. So the standard procedure here would be for Russia to open with the air war. Eliminate Ukrainian planes and air bases first day or two. Then use shitloads of drones to hunt and kill Ukrainian air defenses (like SAM batteries). This would take some time and AA batteries are usually mobile. If drones get shot down no Russians die. If they succeed they hurt Ukrainians. Once the AA capability of Ukraine is greatly rescued, Russian has free airspace with little threat. Now it’s easy and unfair. Russia will destroy convoys (I’ve seen this in 2020 Armenia war where dozens or more men die instantly), hunt Ukrainian tanks, mortars, artillery batteries, CPs and supply depots. This all would take 2-3 weeks bare minimum but probably longer. Once Russian launches its main ground invasion thrusts Ukraine would have limited supplies, little to no heavy weapons, lots of casualties, and very possible, low morale. They would get steamrolled.

The key to it all is the regular push from Moscow for Ukraine to accept a federalization plan that spins out power from the central government to the states. From this (https://static.rusi.org/special-report-202202-ukraine-web.pdf):

> But military posturing has a second effect. As tensions rise, Western capitals will be desperate for ‘de-escalation’ and, should Moscow offer opportunities for such a draw down that comes at the expense of Ukrainian sovereignty, then Moscow hopes the West will pressure Kyiv into accepting it.

> If the government in Kyiv is strong, then it will reject such propositions out of hand, including the implementation of the Minsk agreement in a manner consistent with Moscow’s interpretation whereby the federalisation of Ukraine would cede Russia control over the politics of Donetsk and Luhansk and thereby give Russia a veto over Ukrainian policy.31 But if a political crisis in Kyiv can be manufactured, then the Ukrainian government may bow to external pressure. Russia either directly supplies or can control up to 60% of the fuel supply to Ukraine along with a significant proportion of the country’s electricity. The speed at which Russia could bring about a domestic crisis is therefore a serious concern. Russia could also bring about an immediate political crisis in Ukraine by offering official recognition of Donbas and Luhansk, which would force Kyiv to respond and potentially provide a pretext for escalation.

> As Moscow has already demonstrated in Belarus and has begun to achieve in Kazakhstan, concessions to Russia that allow limited military and political interference in another state are but the first step in the progressive subversion of that state’s independence. Over time, small concessions regarding federal autonomy can create an opening that Russia will exploit to infiltrate Ukrainian politics until a pretext can be manufactured to achieve a Russian military presence on Ukrainian soil and eventual state capture.

> A critical line of effort in Kyiv, therefore, is shoring up the stability of the state. Ukrainian officials are desperately working to identify Moscow’s levers for destabilisation and countering them before they can create sufficient social unrest to allow Moscow to unleash more destructive methods of destabilisation. Military deterrence is but one line of effort in this game of cat and mouse, and for Ukraine it is a game they expect to have to play for months and years if the matter is not resolved in days and weeks by military invasion. If the threat of invasion protracts, however, and Ukraine improves its defence and economic stability, Russia’s levers of influence may fade. There is therefore a serious risk that Russia will provoke a crisis, whether through military or covert means, to create the pretext for a more rapid seizure of Ukraine. This is deemed Moscow’s second choice if Ukraine cannot be forced to surrender its sovereignty. But it is an option for which Russia retains the capabilities and readiness, and in the event of invasion it will not only be a conventional military effort, but coincide with the activation of covert operations across Ukraine.

In short, I think that he is going to try and grab as much land as possible then push for negotiations to end the conflict. At the negotiations he'll ""generously"" offer to give back the land they captured (probably minus a land bridge to Crimea), as well as Donbas and Luhansk, with the caveat that the only way that will happen is if Ukraine agrees to federalization.

If that happens, Moscow can just pick off each state through internal manipulation or play some against others if they resist influence from the Kremlin.

The last few years Moscow has been trying to use the ""separatists"" in Donbas and Luhansk as the lever to force Ukraine to accept federalization. They've been coming in trying to play the ""peacemaker"" between these ""legitimate independence movements"", the Ukrainian government, and other countries to get everyone to play along to force Ukraine to devolve power from the central government out to the different regions.

No one has bought their BS.

Now we are onto the shitty phase of them trying to force what they want through military means, and this whole thing is why I think that people misunderstand the goals and are wondering how Russia plans to capture and occupy a large-ish nation of 40m people with just 150k troops. 

To me that's never been the goal. The Russians aren't going to fight urban battles and devastate Ukraine, they are going to strangle it by controlling land and movement, but only enough so that they can force negotiations after reducing the Ukrainian military's ability to work. They just want to grab enough so that they have a land bridge to Crimea, and then beyond that enough to hurt Ukraine to the point where they will give up powers to local governments so that Russia can pick them off one by one.

My guess is that any war would quickly move from military action to wanting to negotiate for peace...as long as the conditions set by Moscow are guaranteed and the Ukrainian central government ends up permanently weakened.",False,1645125757.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxch5yu,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

1)gather necessary legal documents place them in a container that is weather resistant

2)prep a go bag for every individual in the house containing a min 24 hr supplies including documents. If you have a vehicle prep 72hr supplies in the vehicle in addition ti the bags. The bags are for getting yourself out on foot and need to be accessible in a moments notice. 

3)if you have a spare sink, bathtub, or any container I'd fill it with water for stand by just in case

4)acquire a paper road map and start drawing out evac routes for yourself with goal destinations in mind. 

5) identify gas shut off valves, this is necessary so in the event you are subject to an attack you can mitigate risk to yourself 

6)relax and stay calm. I understand this is scary but until something happens nothing has happened yet so just chill take time with family and enjoy the company. Not much you can do, the waiting and doom scrolling will kill you

Because NATO is not about other countries or saving lives, it is primarily about the UK/France and the U.S domestic security in light of the threat posed by the former Soviet Bloc. Ensuring they have numerous minor allies ensures that their civilisations will never be challenged by any arch-rival. For the U.S, it guarantees that no country can grow in strength enough, or form an alliance powerful enough to threaten U.S territories directly. This along with their geographic isolation from NATO, affords them essentially unchallenged authority to project force and foreign policy anywhere in the world. 

By banning Ukraine, it would undermine the long-term diplomatic trust in the U.S and their primary European partners and damage their reputations as the homes of democracy and liberty. 

Putin's goal is to sow distrust within NATO itself by having the U.S and/or major European partners make a guarantee that Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries could not ever join. This would make NATO countries question whether they will actually be protected if attacked, and doubt the foundations of 'promise' in diplomacy and peace in other areas as well. If agreements can be ignored or torn up in special cases at the whim of rivals, then how can any country trust a deal made with the U.S/UK/France etc.

It would be like violating a peace treaty. Even Putin can appreciate the value of agreements, by taking seriously the Minsk Protocol in refusing to acknowledge the separatist territories as independent states even with the current situation, and by calling for weapons proliferation limits. 

Quite frankly. Western powers won the Cold War, massively. And they are not prepared to believe that they must make a compromise or some sacrifice now - they believe they are entitled to keep the status quo. Essentially, they are refusing to negotiate quite reasonable terms given the very purpose of NATO is to contain and isolate Russia militarily, politically, and economically. 

Given that the Soviet Union no longer exists and many post-Soviet states do not wish to be politically, economically or militarily aligned with Russia again. Russia however, would like to use the opportunity to take advantage of residual instability and corruption and lack of development in these countries to turn them back towards a pro-Russian diplomatic alignment, because these countries have seen that life is better when partnered with Western Europe. The former states of the Soviet Union contributed massively to the economic development of Russia at the expense of themselves and other member states. 

There is no situation here now in which Russia does not stand to gain some benefit, win or concessions out of the West. 

Putin knows that nobody will help Ukraine, and therefore he can grind them like a kebab until the blood runs down the rivers and refugees flow into Europe and call for peace. Europe does not care for Ukrainians, a war in Ukraine is a useful justification to punish Russia ultimately and push the Russian nation further into social and economic decline, maybe until the people overthrow their government and the oligarchs, and begin improving their national destiny. 

Russia's downfall can therefore be accomplished without the main players of NATO - France, UK and U.S, having to spend too much money or political capital. Germany is a main player in NATO too, but also the most likely to take refugees, and they will also lose their energy supplies from Russia - so they really want to wish this was just a bad dream, but the U.S has promised to cover some of their losses in order to get them on board with arming Ukraine instead of negotiating. 

Russia has nothing to offer in negotiations, therefore the ball has always been in NATO's court.
Ukraine can not promise not to join NATO - that doesn't mean anything to Russia or NATO. Russia needs NATO to make that pledge for it to have real meaning. So essentially, there is nothing Ukraine itself can do to prevent this war except prepare to inflict unbearable casualties on Russia.",False,1645092525.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxaepew,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

It is never just ""to inform"", it is also to influence the opposing side's civilian society and/or leadership. 

Escalating the verbal threats as far as possible is just another step in influencing the opponent. 

I think that how lively this sub is, is a decent indication of relative succes in causing unrest on itself. Take these threatening messages with a grain of salt. Sure, Ukraine has a risk of getting invaded for ""peacekeeping"" purposes. 

War with Nato, absolutely not. Russia doesn't have the capacity ready for that and it sure as hell will not profit in any commercial or influential way if it does.

fb86a884ed030dfb7dc5b4add0286672,sukgvr,hxbh49e,"It’s a lot to explain tbh. I’ll sum it up to a little explanation.

Ukraine was a part of Russia during the Soviet Union. Russia doesn’t want Ukraine to join NATO (a group created by the WWII treated to prevent future world wars) and they don’t want NATO to make it any further east than it already has. 

Because of this, Russia is demanding NATO to stay away from Ukraine but Ukraine still wants to join. So Russia is threatening to invade and take over the entire country for itself to “solve the problem”. That’s wrong and results in many deaths and casualties. Think Hitler invading Poland, which kicked off WWII. 

NATO is going to back Ukraine up though and defend them as much as possible. If Russia invaded, it’ll result in a war. Every country is trying not to put their troops in Ukraine so they won’t physically fight because that would result in a official world war. 

Russia is known for making false stories and pointing fingers at other people to try and justify what it wants to do. So Russia is spreading misinformation and trying to make it seem like Ukraine is causing them to invade and attack.

Russia also lied about withdrawing it’s troops (they lie a lot) to make people put their guards down, meanwhile they were actually building up more troops and military along the borders. Russia invaded and took over Crimea and they have access in Belarus too so their troops are there surrounding Ukraine as well.

They like to do things like this to honor their connections. 

It's *kkkkkiiiiinnnnddddaaa* analogous to American Southerners trumping up the 'heritage not hate' argument over confederate statues but it differs in one major way... Russia loves to key in on local governments blocking their efforts as a casus belli for aggression. 

Case in point: Estonia in 2007 had a situation where Estonians wanted a statue of a Russian Soldier (""The Bronze Soldier"" Statue) that commemorated Russia's ""liberation"" of Estonia in WW2 from the Nazis destroyed. Russian speaking Estonians wanted it preserved as is in a prominent spot in the capital city. The government compromised and moved it to a more appropriate location: a local Russian military cemetery where Soviet war dead were buried. Good compromise, right? No. Or... [Nyet to the Russians.](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/27/world/europe/27cnd-estonia.html) 

It led to a riot in the capital city, Tallinn... normally a pretty sleepy little city, Called the [Bronze Night.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Night) Authorities re-asserted order and all was well right? Nope. Massive Russian retaliatory cyber attacks the [very next day.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia)

What’s not normal is the amount of firing and some of the locations. The average amount of ceasefire violations on the lines are 4-8 violations per day. Today, last I checked, was already up to 29. So that’s a huge difference. However 29 violations is still light combat compared to an actual invasion. 

So the key here is that we have above average shelling. Add that to Russia massing and it’s talking points and it’s another worrying sign. But 29 incidents in an almost decade old war zone is not the beginning of a bigger war/invasion. And also the shelling came from with Russian backed rebel land, so Russia will deny it was actually them that fired shots.

 >The Shelling of Mainila (Finnish: Mainilan laukaukset, Swedish: Skotten i Mainila, Russian: Ма́йнильский инциде́нт, romanized: Máynil'skiy intsidént) was a military incident on 26 November 1939 in which the Soviet Union's Red Army shelled the Soviet village of Mainila (Russian: Ма́йнило, romanized: Máynilo) near Beloostrov. The Soviet Union declared that the fire originated from Finland across the nearby border and claimed to have had losses in personnel. Through that false flag operation, the Soviet Union gained a great propaganda boost and a casus belli for launching the Winter War four days later.

Since most of this has started, Russia has said numerous times that they weren't invading (which we obviously take with a grain of salt), but then Ukraine also said multiple times that they weren't worried about it and didn't think Russia would invade. At the same time, NATO (mainly us), have consistently said that Russia was going to launch a mass invasion and that we are on the brink of war, da da da...Is it that far fetched to see that we have kind of egged Russia on in this thing? Let's say for argument that Russia didn't actually intend to invade, or didn't want it to be a conflict, I feel like our constant insisting that this was some sort of impending act of war actually painted Putin into a corner to where he now has to battle/balance his ego and power with his possible desire to not go to war. If he backs out now, he's seen as a coward by the world and by his own people for bending to NATO. 

After what he said about us pulling out of Afghanistan, I doubt that he would put himself in a position to be seen as the ""coward"" (even though that may be the right choice). In a truly terrifying fashion, this thing really does come down to ego and power. This all depends on whether Russia's collective desire to be ""BIG STRONG BEAR"" is going to outweigh their logic and reason to the point that they would risk a world war over it.

I’m in the boat that Russia will probably take chunks of Ukraine, a few bloody battles will be fought, and that will be that.  Then in a few years we repeat.

We literally had Putin threaten nukes if NATO or the US get involved.

 >A deputy chief of mission (DCM, in Europe the term deputy head of mission – DHoM or DHM is used instead) is the number-two diplomat assigned to an embassy or other diplomatic mission. The deputy chief of mission is usually considered the second-in-command to the head of mission (usually an ambassador). DCMs serve as chargé d'affaires (that is, as acting chief of mission) when the titular head of mission is outside the host country or when the post is vacant. DCMs typically serve as a key advisor to the chief of mission as well as a chief of staff, responsible for the day-to-day management of the post.

We note that the American side did not give a constructive response to the basic elements of the draft agreement with the United States on security guarantees prepared by the Russian side. We are talking about the rejection of further expansion of NATO, the withdrawal of the ""Bucharest formula"" that ""Ukraine and Georgia will become members of NATO"", and the refusal to create military bases on the territory of states that were formerly part of the USSR and are not members of the alliance, including the use of their infrastructure for conducting any military activities, as well as the return of military capabilities, including strike, and NATO's infrastructure as of 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed. These provisions are of fundamental importance to the Russian Federation.

The package nature of the Russian proposals was ignored, from which ""convenient"" topics were deliberately chosen, which, in turn, are ""twisted"" in the direction of creating advantages for the United States and its allies. This approach, as well as the accompanying rhetoric of US officials, reinforces reasonable doubts that Washington is really committed to correcting the situation in the field of European security.


The growing military activity of the United States and NATO directly on Russia's borders is alarming, while our ""red lines"" and fundamental security interests, as well as Russia's sovereign right to protect them, continue to be ignored. Ultimatum demands to withdraw troops from certain areas on Russian territory, accompanied by threats of tougher sanctions, are unacceptable and undermine the prospects for reaching real agreements.

In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures.

You don't understand.  
1) First of all, Crimea had no legal government at the time, the coup gave Russia a chance to ensure the future of the Sevastopol military base (hence, the future of presence in the Black Sea). Other option would be to wait for Ukraine to terminate treaty that allowed Russian fleet there with full support of NATO and EU (hence, greatly lowering defense against NATO). That is not happening, putin is too smart for that.  
2) Even if voting in Crimea was not frauded (which it was for sure), result would be adverse for the West. My guess is about 75% of people there would vote to join Russia. That's why there was not a single observer from OSCE, even though they were invited. That, and the fact that this annexation is not in favor of NATO. Kosovo was, Crimea wasn't.  
3) Russia is not ""just defending"". Same goes for China and NATO. It's geopolitics, there is no care about human rights, states rights, etc. Shame, but that's just the way it is.

There's too many people within Ukraine's military that resist reform, modernization, and the elimination of corruption.  Zelensky, the head of the state, hasn't been able to correct this.  It's a big part of the reason WHY the US isn't willing to intervene, militarily.  Striking similarities to the Afghan army that we tried to create, and failed at.  A military, largely funded by the west, where too much of our efforts are lost due to corruption.

You ask:  Is Zelensky in over his head?

>Prior to his acting career, Zelensky obtained a degree in law from Kyiv National Economic University. He then pursued comedy and created the production company Kvartal 95, which produces films, cartoons, and TV shows including Servant of the People, in which Zelensky played the role of president of Ukraine. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. A political party bearing the same name as the television show was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.

That's where we need to step up in my opinion, it's a complete joke that nobody is willing to come to Ukraine's defence. Letting this happen is literally what erodes our freedoms, and if Ukraine's sovereignty can't be protected then neither can anybody else's.

But, germanic tribes succeeded the Roman Empire so I don't agree that just surrendering is the only option. In some cases (and this isn't my decision to make but the people of Ukraine's), if you can't win the next best option is to make an invasion as painful as possible, and hope it's enough to discourage further action.

I wouldn't say Ukraine is totally unprotected though, the allied countries have kept their cards close but I can certainly see crippling sanctions being part of a quick response. There's a reason Putin is trying so hard to justify boots on the ground and so far, hasn't been able to.

An invasion of Ukraine now would irrevocably change the future of the world and the dynamics of maintained peace in Europe. Even foreign interference and spying by Russia and China (and presumably the U.S) are at higher levels than ever in history, even in the Cold War there is currently more espionage going on according to some statements by intelligence agencies. 

Thank you for asking the question though, which wasn't silly at all! I'm sure diplomats are asking themselves the same questions hence why they have been unable to negotiate on any point successfully for months/years now. At best war is avoided, and maybe the NATO situation doesn't change but Putin wins some agreements on banning new weapon deployments in Eastern Europe such as certain types of missiles or anti-air systems/missile defence systems or radars. 

---------------- If you are interested I will expand on my thoughts about this situation. 

War and national security is pretty much never rational or realistic - it is all based on fear, distrust and knowledge of history. World peace is not easy to maintain at all. I believe the only reason countries in Europe are not already fighting wars and changing borders again is because so many have nuclear weapons and they are so economically intertwined that their economies and trade would be seriously ruined by annoying their neighbours. 

Russia is not really in this club and so they have little to lose after enduring so many sanctions already. However, Russia borders Europe, and therefore Europeans must take all Russian security concerns seriously to maintain the peace in Europe which is like a powder keg compared to other parts of the world - but doing so conflicts with their relationship with the U.S. The U.S has a foreign policy of containment and does not deal well with such peace negotiations as they have no reason to compromise/nothing to lose being so far away. I would even say that the U.S relationship with most of its allies is somewhat coercive and abusive. That's the price of having access to the world's largest economy and some of the most advanced weapons and intelligence/surveillance capabilities developed. 

Essentially, the U.S would prefer Russia to remain as a geopolitical rival, and this is why U.S foreign policy has failed to deal with the success of a socialist China as well, or even take it seriously while the country was still developing. 

You could say that the U.S is in a panic now, as Russian relations and military cooperation improves with China despite both considering each other as rivals (Chinese army academies primarily study Russia and not the U.S in terms of potential conflict, because China does not project power abroad and will only be challenged by the U.S in a situation close to their border where the war will be defensive). 

We as individuals live short and relatively straightforward lives. Governments - even the U.S - think about the future of their nation and the world into the next 100 years and they plan ahead. So many governments for example make 100-year or 99-year leases on property to foreign companies or governments, if you want one example, while many of us plebs would not even believe that we will not have a WW3 apocalypse during that time. Governments build bunkers to survive events like that while ordinary people do not. To understand the irrational thinking of governments and peace and the significance of 'borders', we must simply look to reading our history books. It is well known that Putin, like Hitler and Stalin, has read and studied European classics and the history of great leaders, nations and wars, and he sees himself and Russia no less, maintaining a great status in modern history (the present). 

Ukraine presents an opportunity of crisis. Like Russia still needs a 'casus belli' (justification) to attack Ukraine or steal territories, so does the U.S need a casus belli to place more sanctions and economic isolation on Russia to 'finish them off' - they cannot just do it unilaterally as Russia may retaliate against U.S trading/military partners who in turn will become frustrated with the U.S and revaluate their relationship, and consider forming new partnerships with other European countries (which are not as lucrative or beneficial).",False,1645095014.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxai5r9,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

1bbc7d6bee4ea976bdba17bd33bc852f,sukgvr,hxb6w63,"In Ukraine

There is no ""Russian invasion"" of Ukraine, which the United States and its allies have been announcing at the official level since last autumn, so the allegations about ""Russia's responsibility for escalation"" can only be regarded as an attempt to exert pressure and devalue Russia's proposals for security guarantees.

The reference in this context to Russia's obligations under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 has nothing to do with the internal Ukrainian conflict and does not extend to the circumstances resulting from internal factors there. The loss of territorial integrity by the Ukrainian state is the result of the processes that have occurred within it.

Russia's accusations in the U.S. response that it ""occupied Crimea"" also do not stand up to scrutiny. In 2014, a coup d'état took place in Kiev, the initiators of which, with the support of the United States and its allies, set a course for the creation of a nationalist state that infringes on the rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking population, as well as other ""non-titular"" ethnic groups. It is not surprising that in such a situation, the Crimeans voted for reunification with Russia. The decision of the people of Crimea and Sevastopol to return to the Russian Federation was made by freely expressing their will in order to exercise the right to self-determination enshrined in the UN Charter. No force or threat of force was used. The question of Crimea's ownership is closed.

In the event of Ukraine's admission to NATO, there will be a real threat that the regime in Kiev will try to ""return"" Crimea by force, dragging the United States and its allies, in accordance with Art. 5 of the Washington Treaty, into a direct armed conflict with Russia with all the ensuing consequences


The thesis repeated in the US response that Russia allegedly ""ignited the conflict in the Donbas"" is untenable. Its causes are purely internal in Nature. A settlement is possible only through the implementation of the Minsk agreements and a set of measures, the priority and responsibility for the implementation of which are clearly spelled out and unanimously confirmed by UN Security Council Resolution 2202, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom. In paragraph 2 of this resolution, the parties are named Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk. None of these documents mention Russia's responsibility for the conflict in the Donbas. Russia, together with the OSCE, plays the role of mediator in the main negotiation format – the contact group – and together with Berlin and Paris – in the Normandy format, which formulates recommendations to the parties to the conflict and monitors their implementation.

To de-escalate the situation around Ukraine, it is fundamentally important to take the following steps. This is forcing Kiev to implement a set of measures, stopping the supply of weapons to Ukraine, recalling all Western advisers and instructors from there, refusing NATO countries to conduct any joint exercises with the Armed Forces of Ukraine and withdrawing all foreign weapons previously supplied to Kiev from Ukrainian territory.

In this regard, we draw attention to the fact that Russian President Vladimir Putin at a press conference following talks in Moscow with French President Emmanuel Macron on February 7, 2022 stressed that we are open to dialogue and urge ""to think about stable security conditions for all, equal for all participants in international life.""",False,1645107836.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxb5z4n,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

 >Salami slicing tactics, also known as salami slicing, salami tactics, the salami-slice strategy, or salami attacks, is a divide and conquer process of threats and alliances used to overcome opposition. With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically political, piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated ""slice by slice"" until it realizes, usually too late, that it is virtually gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several factions within the opposing political party and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the ""sliced"" sides to protest.

It would be unprecedented for other countries to intervene and fight against Russia due to M.A.D doctrine - if for example Russia was suffering heavy losses in Ukraine. 
In my opinion there are only 3 outcomes here for peace: 

1. NATO bans Ukraine from joining.
2. European nations independently send troops and units to fortify Ukraine's border to prevent Russia from starting a war with multiple nations.

We note that in its response to Russian proposals, the United States insists that progress in improving the situation in the field of European security ""can be achieved only in conditions of de-escalation in relation to Russia's threatening actions directed against Ukraine,"" which, as we understand, implies a demand for the withdrawal of Russian troops from the borders of Ukraine.

Otherwise, the American side is silent on our proposals contained in para. 2 Articles 4 et seq. 1 Article 5 of the draft bilateral treaty states that ""the current configuration of U.S. and NATO forces is limited, proportionate, and fully consistent with the obligations under the NATO-Russia Founding Act.""

We proceed from the premise that the deployment of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation on its territory does not and cannot affect the fundamental interests of the United States. We would like to remind you that there are no our forces on the territory of Ukraine.

At the same time, the United States and its allies advanced their military infrastructure to the east, deployed contingents in the territories of new members. They circumvented the limitations of the CFE Treaty and very freely interpreted the provisions of the NATO-Russia Founding Act on the refusal of ""additional permanent deployment of significant combat forces.""

2. The OSCE has never found ""occupation troops"" in the Donbas for the whole 8 years of the conflict. The rebels are fighting there, and they are citizens of Ukraine. How can Ukrainian citizens be ""occupation forces"" of Ukraine? They **are** the Ukraine.

Although Russia is obviously helping them with weapons.

But this is not the same as having ""occupation troops"" there. The Ukrainian army would not have lasted all these years if it had fought with Russia. They are at war with their own citizens, who did not accept the 2014 coup. Open your eyes, Kiev simply does not want to let go of the rebellious regions, and they do not want to accept the new government.

The Ukrainian government benefits from this conflict. All failures in domestic politics and the economy can be blamed on it. Also easy international loans can be obtained under the pretext of war needs, which can be quickly plundered and justified by the fact that there is a war going on in the country, which eats up high costs.

The cost for our current entitlement spending FAR outweighs the costs of our military, even in its bloated and wasteful state.  

>but when a corporation needs to be bailed out, we got endless money. 

Im completely against corporate bailouts.  

>Or when there's a war to be fought, then the coffers never run dry.

Again, even with 20 years of constant warfare expenditures, our current entitlement spending is orders of magnitude greater than our military expenditures.  And thats before you add on entitlements like healthcare and college.  Ironically, in both cases, its government subsidization that is actually driving up the overall costs. The US isnt some tiny homogeneous European nation. 

>Economically speaking, the US would dwarf the capabilities of Russia, and militarily as well.  
>  
>It's just sad that these are the things we have endless money for.

Again.  Its not endless money.  There are expenditures that are fiscally realistic, and expenditures that are not.  Russia, economically cant sustain a wide scale conflict for more than a few months, and actual sanctions (not just the individual based ones Obama enacted) would cripple its already flailing economy.  If Russia goes this route, there is no good outcome for Russia, and either outcome would happen before the US posted its quarterly financial disclosures.

Those people also assume that Russia invading would be about direct occupation and I wanted to point out that Russia has been trying for years to weaken the Ukrainian central government through devolution of power, and that could still be the goal here.

Those people are right about that being too few to occupy Ukraine, but it seems like enough if the Russians are planning to do something like an WW2 island hopping campaign where they capture mostly just territory, skip all the cities, and really only engage in fighting for a few specific strategic targets. 

They don't need to directly control everything, they just need to diminish the Ukrainian ability to fight and hold enough territory to strangle Ukraine enough to force them to the negotiation table so that Russia can get the things they want, and then use shady politics to corrupt smaller entities over time.

Also I think that Ukraine is going to surprise the hell out of the Russians if they do invade, and the whole thing is going to go worse then they are planning. Ukraine isn't some backwater in Central Asia or the Caucasus - it's full of engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, manufacturing capability, etc. Above and beyond the support they've been getting from NATO countries recently, they have a lot of brainpower and resources to do things themselves...and don't forget the nearly decade of direct military training and reorganization that has been aided by western countries.

Conversely, the Cold War was about Communism vs democracy and capitalism. That's why Americans voted for leaders that fought Communism. Vietnam was a mistake though, a hot war was not worth fighting over this.

Why did the USSR invade Afghanistan? You didn't have any big business interests, it was a government decision to spread communism and your own interests.

Also, good relations between countries = more trade = more money. Free trade in the EU has made all of Europe richer. A conflict between Russia and the west in Ukraine will be terrible for the economy.

Your ideas about how the world works are leaving your country behind. This is why Poland has done so well since the fall of Communism and why Russia has done so poorly - Poland joined the EU free trade zone and liberalized their economy. Russia has gone in a different, more corrupt direction.

Yugoslavia - first attack was even without UN authorization, and then Miloshevich died in prison, and
jailers never allowed doctors to him. Why? As a result, we don't know anything.

(Short opinion on that: US and NATO never really cared about genocide. I've heard a shitton of supportive proclamations from the collective West towards Chechens during Chechen wars, but I know a couple of Russians who fled from Grozny in 1992-1993 even before first Chechen war, and there was a real genocide of Russians. Why collective West didn't support Russians?)

You forgot Gulf War. Even tho it's not officially NATO operation, we all know de-facto it is (UK, USA, France).
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria. All these are middle-east countries with oil. Coincidence?  (In my opinion, ISIS is a result of that war)

Gulf of Aden - alright, I can respect that, but Yemen people are suffering to this day.

To get right to the crux of this matter, even if Belarus, Ukraine and Georgia were in NATO, do you really think NATO would ever invade Russia? The US has never (and will never) invade a country that can nuke us into oblivion. Americans would NEVER support this.

With all due respect, your government has to convince you that we are a massive threat and we want to destroy Russia because they don't want the US to inspire Russian democratic movements AND your government wants to imperialize Eastern Europe. None of this is about money - it would be better economically if we got along with Russia. Hell, we'd all be richer if Russia joined the EU and stayed out of Ukraine and Belarus.

And for the record, I am against imperialism in general. The US gov't has fucked up plenty of times but I've been against the Iraq War since day 1. In the case of Ukraine, I support us helping the government since a majority of Ukrainians want US and western support and want to keep their country.

Germany does want it though. We don't want it because it makes Europe more dependent on a country that can invade and conquer any former USSR state at any time, as Russia is proving right now.

NS2 would have 110% happened if your government just didn't invade Ukraine. This isn't rocket science, you guys are fucking up over and over again.

Bernie Sanders almost won the democrat primary but people over the age of 35 don't like social democratic government. If you look at polls, socialism still is not popular in the US. Never has been.

This is capitalism. The government didn't ban Trump from social networks, private companies (Twitter) made that decision. It's businesses doing what they want with their platforms.

Yes, private companies have a right to determine who gets to operate on their platform. That is capitalism, Trump doesn't have a right to have a Twitter account. He wasn't banned by the government, he was banned by Twitter for violating their terms of service. 

He lied about losing the election for months b/c he's a lunatic. 

>It is your government that spends the most money on the army to build military bases near our borders. Many in these countries do not want this in case of war, they will get hit first.

The governments of all of these countries allow us to be there. They are not forced to do so, we don't have bases in plenty of countries we are allied with. 

>If we had the money , we created a color revolution in Canada with the help of the same truckers and brought missiles there , since the main threat to the world is the United States , their 800 military bases around the world and you call us aggressive !!

Tons of data has been written about this, but we are living in the most peaceful era in human history. Countries usually don't invade one anymore due to US influence, military and hegemony.

> Let us live in peace! We in Russia want peace and development.

Hard to believe your government does given you've been at war in Ukraine for 8 years and invaded Georgia before that. You also invaded Afghanistan just like we did. 

I believe that you and everyday Russians want peace.

>You are stuffing Ukraine with propaganda, where there are now a bunch of Nazis. Read about the Azov brigade, you wanted to take it to NATO back in 2008.

The only reason Nazi groups are in Ukraine is because your government has been purposefully destabilizing the country for a decade. Most Ukrainians who want Russia out of their country are not Neo Nazis and we both know that. Most Ukrainians fighting Russia are not Nazis, but how can you stop Nazis from picking up guns and fighting Russia in a war zone? You can't

""After dropping to 55% in December, support for Ukraine’s NATO membership climbed back up in January and reached 62% in February, according to the survey by Ukraine’s polling organization Rating Group published Friday.""

Those 62% are not Nazis. They want to be a part of NATO. This is why we have military bases all over the world, because countries invite us in because they are scared of countries like Russia. You say Ukraine wants to join due to propaganda, while your own government has been funding and supporting a separatist war WITHIN UKRAINE for 8 years. THAT is why they want to join NATO, the answer is obvious. Talk to a Ukrainian and they will tell you exactly why and you would be crazy to disagree with them. No Ukrainians wanted to join NATO prior to 2014.

You may want peace but your government doesn't.",1645199945.0,1645192867.0,t3_sukgvr,t1_hxeuc1l,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
