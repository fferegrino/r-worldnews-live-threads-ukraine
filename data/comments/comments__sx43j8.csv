Also the EU has a lot of weird conditionals in their defense clause.  Several countries that joined the EU did the condition that they were neutral parties where this didn't apply.  Finland is technically one of them, though they practically have grown much more aligned to the EU.

If Putin thought there was lack of will to act on this defense clause I could see Putin attacking Finland with the purpose of undermining the stability of the EU. Austria, Ireland and Denmark may want no part.  With how wishy-washy Germany and France have been I could see them decide its not worth all-out war since Finland is teeeeechnically neutral. UK is no longer part of the EU.  It would basically crush the EU.

However his current agression actually works against Russia ever maneuvering to a position where this is possible. Germany is strongly rethinking their reliance on Russian energy.

Both sides try to act like they are the ones in charge of the discussion, which means both sides are talking past each other and its all just a bunch of grandstanding and trying to project strength. For the French/Russian call, I expect it went something like this:

France: ‚ÄúWe cannot allow you to threaten Ukraine, we demand that you pull back your troops‚Äù 

Russia: [literally ignoring every word that France just said] ‚ÄúRussia is upset with NATO expansion in the Baltics and we are here to discuss their removal from the NATO alliance‚Äù

France: [literally ignoring every word that Russia just said] ‚ÄúFurthermore, we demand that you must stop giving the separatists arms and furthering the conflict in that province.‚Äù

This goes on for over an hour with both sides airing their grievances while quietly taking notes of what the other side wants. Then, after the call is over, the leaders go meet with their entire foreign policy team and they go over the demands and look to see what can be done (while hoping the other side is doing the same thing with their demands). 

But, point being, actual negotiations and decisions are rarely hashed out during these phone calls. They are all about showmanship and trying to project strength. The real one-on-one negotiations where compromises are actually decided tend to happen through back channels and via the Foreign Secretaries meeting each other in diplomatic meetings that don‚Äôt get nearly the press coverage of the Heads of State calling each other.",False,1645375625.0,t3_sx43j8,t1_hxpuxrq,,3,2,0,2,0,0,
