Mizintsev also stated that the Ukrainian side was allegedly preparing a provocation with the ""task of striking civilian infrastructure"" near the Odesa port of Pivdennyi, which would lead to a leak of ""chemicals.""

*live feed* 

Russian forces have now shifted their focus to the offensive in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine.  
  
Heavy shelling and fighting have continued in the east as Russia's army attempts to establish control over the region.

4/23/2022 10:49 PM  
Saturday's key points:  


* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the journalist gathered at a Kyiv metro station on Saturday that he would meet with Vladimir Putin if it meant the end of the war.  

* However, Zelenskyy also emphasised that all negotiations would be over if Russian troops end up killing the besieged Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol.  

* Russian shelling of urban areas in the east of Ukraine continued on Saturday, with reports of at least two civilians dead in the eastern city of Popasna and another two in the Kharkiv region.  

* Moldova summoned the Russian ambassador in protest at a Russian general's comments that Moscow wants to capture southern Ukraine to gain access to a breakaway Moldovan region.  

* UN accuses Russia of actions that 'could amount to war crimes,' claiming its armed forces have 'indiscriminately bombarded and shelled populated areas'.  

* Ukrainian official says fighting has not stopped at the besieged Azovstal steel mill where the country's fighters are holding out. Putin previously told Russian forces not to storm the industrial site and instead seal it off.  

* Russia FM blames Ukraine for halted peace talks, saying 'they have put up with their destiny'.

**Russia continues bombing Azovstal plant - Ukraine commander**

Turning now to the devastated southern city of Mariupol.  
  
Russian planes are continuing to drop bombs on the Azovstal steelworks plant - where the city's last Ukrainian defenders are holed-up - a deputy commander of the Azov regiment has said.  
  
""Naval artillery and cannons are being used, tanks are firing, and there are infantry attempts to storm"" the massive industrial area in central Mariupol, Svyatoslav Palamar said in a video address published on Azov's Telegram account on Sunday.  
  
He stressed that the Russians were not stopping even for the Orthodox Easter - a major Christian festival.  
  
Palamar also thanked all those who have been trying to evacuate civilians trapped in underground bunkers at the site, as well as negotiating to allow the Ukrainian fighters withdraw from the besieged southern city.  
  
While many Ukrainians across the country were celebrating Easter, in Mariupol ""the enemy is dropping bombs on the heads of innocent children"", he added.  
  
The Azov regiment, along with a Marine brigade, border guards and police officers, are now the last Ukrainian defenders left in the strategic city on the Sea of Azov coast.  
  
The reported bombardment comes despite an order earlier this week by Russian President Vladimir Putin to call off an assault on the steelworks. Putin said his troops must seal off the site instead.",False,1650797418.0,t3_uama2x,t3_uama2x,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Putin is stuck in the 90s when Ukraine was a lot more corrupt and weak than it is right now and he is mentally incapable of adapting to the new reality. Coupled that with the army of yes-men who confirm his every insane idea and you get the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022.

Putin is mentally incapable of recognizing (if he is even being told) that the Ukrainian army on the field right now is as numerous as the Russian army and that advanced NATO weapons are pouring into the country every day. The Russian army has 0 chance of holding Donbas. The only thing that will happen is huge casualties on both sides and many dead Ukrainian civilians. Putin isn't aware that he is fighting the winter war on crack since then Finland didn't have the support of the entire free world.

Sure wish I would be a fly on the wall to hear exactly what briefings Putin is receiving about the front line and how the relate to empirical reality because the decisions of the Russian army are 100% not driven by military strategy but by the hallucinatory ideas of a half mentally disabled dictator who thinks this is the year 1995.",1650844383.0,1650843623.0,t3_uama2x,t3_uama2x,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

1) love the user name.
2)  you asked ""what if I am wrong"".  There are two ways I can answer this:

2a)  what if an asteroid hits the earth in 48 hours and kills us all.  Should we just give up now, because it absolutely could happen any day.  Quit your job,  go on a bender.

2b) it is a hypothesis.  You can't go through life NOT doing something because there might maybe be risk.  IF NATO engaged they would do the analysis and find they don't believe the nuclear threat credible.  The same way Kennedy did during the Cuban missile crisis.  

I am going to assume you are young and have never had to face a semicredible escalation that has a tiny chance to go nuclear.  This shit is old hat for anyone born in the early 80s and earlier.

While Alexander Schallenberg does advocate deeper ties between Europe and Ukraine, full membership is not one of them and instead, other paths should be used

Ukraine should not be offered European Union membership, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said last week at a European media summit, Pravda reported.  
  
While Schallenberg does advocate deeper ties between Europe and Ukraine, full membership is not one of them and instead, other paths should be used. This would include joining the EU's economic zone or just maintaining the current status quo, Austrian outlet Heute reported.  
  
As for why Ukraine shouldn't receive EU candidate status this June, Schallenberg pointed to states in the Western Balkans that are currently joining talks for EU accession.  
  
Joining the European Union is something Ukraine has vocally called for. This follows years of warming relations with the West, but these calls became even more vocal following Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February.  
  
Ahead of this invasion and during it, Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly cited fears of Ukraine's closer ties with the West, with many pointing to efforts to join both the EU and NATO among them.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has already submitted Ukraine's application to join and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has also said that they want Ukraine in the EU.",False,1650808198.0,t3_uama2x,t3_uama2x,,0,0,0,0,0,0,

""Second, Macron has repeatedly emphasized that European culture and civilization is distinct from the United States and China—but includes Russia. Macron acknowledges that the United States is in the “Western camp” but argues it is “[not promoting](https://lv.ambafrance.org/Ambassadors-conference-Speech-by-M-Emmanuel-Macron-President-of-the-Republic) the same brand of humanism” as Europe (including, as Macron defines it, Russia). Similarly, “[Chinese civilization](https://lv.ambafrance.org/Ambassadors-conference-Speech-by-M-Emmanuel-Macron-President-of-the-Republic)” does not have “the same collective preferences, to put it mildly, or the same values” as Europe. By equating Washington and Beijing as equally inimical to European interests, Macron argues that “what Europe [represents](https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron/2017/09/26/president-macron-gives-speech-on-new-initiative-for-europe)” cannot be entrusted to “the other side of the Atlantic or on the edges of Asia.” Russia, on the other hand, has a special place in Macron’s pantheon of powers as “[part of Europe](https://lv.ambafrance.org/Ambassadors-conference-Speech-by-M-Emmanuel-Macron-President-of-the-Republic)” as much as France—even as an active player in [spearheading](https://lv.ambafrance.org/Ambassadors-conference-Speech-by-M-Emmanuel-Macron-President-of-the-Republic) the “project of European civilization.” (This is, of course, an odd reading of Western cultural, political, and intellectual history.) Macron’s conviction that Russia should be pulled into Europe and the United States should be kept out made him seek a “[new relationship](https://lv.ambafrance.org/Ambassadors-conference-Speech-by-M-Emmanuel-Macron-President-of-the-Republic)” with Putin’s Russia—against the obvious interests of many European nations that saw Russia and the United States differently.""

Then Russia blows up its own oil distribution facility. Seems stupid right? Well, Russia’s oil is mostly blocked right now. It’s income from oil is severely reduced. We say oil revenue but it’s really gas revenue that is key. IF the ability to move gas to Germany etc isn’t affected then Russia still has their income. 

Now Europe is desperately trying to move away from Russian oil and gas, but if I understand correctly, oil is likely to be first. They are doing it on their own schedules under their own terms. If Ukraine was to say - blow up the oil distribution capabilities of Russia to Eastern Europe and effectively undercut all those schedules, that would rightly piss off a lot of countries currently supporting Ukraine’s war efforts, maybe enough to get them to stop. 

Also, This fire doesn’t affect their ability to continue to sell oil to countries like India, who are soon to be the only countries buying it anyway.

ROMAN PETRENKO - SUNDAY, 24 APRIL 2022, 13:52  
  
Self-proclaimed President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who allows Russian missiles to be launched on Ukraine from his territory, has called on neighbouring countries to ""be friendly"".  
  
Source: Lukashenko in his Easter address  
  
Quote: ""Here in this cosy church, my favourite church, I would like to appeal not only to Belarusians, but first of all to our neighbours. Let's take care of the peace. It is so important now...  
  
Let's live together in friendship. I would like to appeal to my fellow politicians: let's not create problems for our people, there are enough of them as it is. Just look at what is happening to our neighbours Lithuania and Latvia, and the Poles.  
  
I’m not even mentioning Ukraine in this regard. They were such happy, cheerful people. They lived in a prosperous world, they had it all. Where are they today? They’re lining up at the border and asking us to let them into Belarus, if only to buy buckwheat. Never mind buckwheat – there’s a shortage of salt, they are asking us for salt.""

The main issue is that once a country’s in you can’t do shit to reign them in.

I get that we want to stick is to Russia and Ukraine is the good guy in the war, but Ukraine is still a somewhat backwards society. For example, they still discriminate heavily against LGBT people and don’t even recognize same sex relationships. Homophobia is pretty ingrained in their society, and while, they’ve been making great progress in recent years, they are still backwards compared to our western attitudes.   


Ukraine also has issues with violence towards women, human trafficking, and a slew of other human rights violation, especially towards minorities and marginalized groups, such as drug users.   


Politically, the future of Ukraine is also uncertain. While they may be somewhat pro-Western now, we have no guarantee that they will remain so in the future. Ukraine is also considered one of the most corrupt nations. It’s also quite poor compared with Western Europe.

>**Appeal of the Russian chess players to the President of the Russian Federation**  
""We are against any military action on the territory of Ukraine and call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful decision to the conflict through the path of dialogue and diplomatic negotiations. For us, it is unbearably painful to see the catastrophe that is happening these days with our people.  
""We've played for Russia in individual and, which is a special honor, team competitions. We are sure that chess and sports in general should unite people. Our country has done its best to organize the most complex and prestigious international events even on the peak of the pandemic.  
""Chess teaches you to be responsible for your actions; each move is meaningful and a mistake can bring you to a fatal point of no return. This used to be a sport, but now the human lives, human rights and freedoms, human dignity, the present and the future of our countries are at stake.  
""During these tragic days we are thinking of all the people caught in the midst of this frightful conflict. We share the pain of our Ukrainian colleagues and call for peace.""  
**We share the pain of our Ukrainian colleagues and call for peace.**  
""The Ukrainian chess team is the reigning European team champion and one of the strongest teams in the world, like ours. We've played tens of matches and hundreds of games. For us, fair competition has always been above politics, and the Ukrainians shared this feeling. We beg you to preserve the chance for mutual respect among the teams, players and people from both countries.

A lot of my family voted for Trump, and IMHO it was because he gave voice to something they’ve been feeling for years.  The middle class has been getting shafted for years (in relative terms).  The rich are getting richer at a pace unparalleled in US history, and being poor still sucks, but it sucks less than it did in say, 1980.  The middle class is losing and feels less secure than ever, but it seems no politician wants to talk about it and take positive steps to address that.  Even the ones who do come up with solutions that we know are pretty much BS.  Higher minimum wages, or “living wages” are a good idea (and they tend to bring up other wages for more experienced/skilled workers.  $25 an hour isn’t going to cut it if I can go down to my local supermarket and get a job with much less stress for $20 an hour.)  So stuff like that is good in a vacuum—but we all know high minimum wage is gonna make companies try to automate the crap out of anything and everything they can.  (Look at your local Wal-Mart.  There’s 25 check out lines, but only 2 workers doing actual check out, plus another worker supervising all the self-check out lanes.  3 workers for what used to take at least 8-12 workers fifteen years ago.)

Anyway, there’s no easy solutions, if there are any at all, so you have this big class of people—mostly middle/working class—who feel anxious, insecure, and wronged by corporations and the government for the last few decades.

Now, to address any of those issues, Trump was so wrong it was laughable—but the slogan “Make America great again” (before it was a meme) really tapped into and exploited that feeling.  The middle/working class is undoubtedly worse off (in relative terms) than it was in 1960.  Making America great again meant, for them at least, making America once again the more secure, more prosperous place it was for them in the past.

These people are still out there, and they’re still disaffected.  Main stream politicians need to tap into these folks and address their concerns, or otherwise they’ll be ripe for the picking for the next fringe lunatic that comes along.

I wonder if that’s the same type of people that voted for LePen in France.  Either way, best address their concerns.  It’s easy to stereotype them as bigots and crazies, and try to ignore them, but they probably have some very real concerns underneath all that that the mainstream politicians in France aren’t addressing.  And until they do, you’ll have a distressed, angry group of people who will be able to be tapped by the next politician that is smart enough to utilize that anger for their own ends.",False,1650825944.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i6139ku,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

In case some of you have missed it, the past decade especially has increased the worries regarding immigration from areas with completely different cultures and how these cultures appear to have a clash in the west.

Take Finland as an example. For years we've been asking the question if we are on the same path as Sweden. For years the answer was ""no, we're not, it's all good"". Well all of a sudden the authorities finally admitted that street gangs with largely immigrant backgrounds are now a thing in the capital region. This is exactly the type of thing that will drive more Finns to support politicians who want to limit immigration. And when it comes to France they are way ahead of us with their safety concerns so I can absolutely understand voting for someone who promises to fix things.

Though with Le Pen I guess people just completely ignored her ties with Russia and those ties are why it's a good thing she lost.

Their logic being, ""had you fought harder so many wouldn't have died"" which was ridiculous since Stalin himself put those men in such a position by not confronting the reality that Germany was going to invade them and prepared to do so in such an obvious way to Russian intelligence.

The Russian military exhibits little mercy for what it considers its' own failures in general.

We've always been a society torn between the opposite poles of our ideals and our greed. America has never lived up to its founding principles. But America, love us or hate us, is a unique country. It's a unique country because its people despite everything still believe in the future, and they still believe a society where anybody can achieve whatever they set their minds to is one worth fighting for. 

We're divided, we're haunted by the historical ghost of racism, we've allowed corruption to legitimize itself right in front of us, we've let horrible things be carried out in our name. But for all our many, many, flaws we've always striven to be better then what we are. People look at the George Floyd riots and see a rapidly decaying democracy. I see a people doing what they have always done, witnessing injustice and taking it upon themselves to fix it, however an imperfect and chaotic process that is. 

We grow whenever we are divided. From the revolution to the civil war to Vietnam and now. 

What have they done? Watched as one corrupt empire gave way to another corrupt empire? We have our own version of this idiot and they always lose. One way or another, every single one of these people loses. It might take suffering, sacrifice, and pain. It might take anger and widows. But sooner or later people who would crush the human spirit for something as meaningless as nationalism, ethnic supremacy, some faint concept of military glory, those people lose. Their heroes die, their foundations crumble, they are replaced. 

How many asshole politicians has America seen? Corrupt maniacs? We're a country where lunatics who believe in Jewish space lasers cannot only find an audience, they can get elected to one of the most powerful offices on Earth. It's terrifying and horrible, but it's the price we pay for knowing governments are full of shit. And every American knows that, deeply. It's the one thing we are taught from the moment of our birth: don't trust anybody who says they are from the government. It's an attitude so engrained it actually hurts us (""Paying for MY insulin?

There is a later video of UA soldiers driving this thing on paved roads and its obvious the suspension is completely shot. The soldier filming says something like he was ready to puke his guts out after being tossed around driving the thing. Russian forces were known to be moving large amounts of BM-21 Grad systems from storage to the front via rail over the last few weeks. These are Russia's oldest and simplest MLRS systems, in service since the 70s and designed off of older platforms going back to the 40s. It's obvious these are not in great shape. There has been a lot of speculation over the quality of Russian reserve hardware. I think this is a pretty interesting indication of the state of that equipment. Old hardware taken out of storage in bad shape, and as long as its running, whatever its other deficiencies its being sent out to the front. If Russia is sending 70s vintage weapons platforms to the front lines with shot suspensions, you have to wonder what the state of the rest of the kit they're sending forward will be in.",False,1650816844.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i60fkzi,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

The battle in Syria was against mercenaries not the Russian army proper and there is still consensus that the Russian mercenaries were even involved directly just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

I think the best way to prevent bloodshed in Ukraine was to position some token NATO troops in Ukraine. Then it would be up to Russia to engage NATO in another sovereign country. I think they would just pass with the invasion, or attack NATO and bear the consequences.

I think one really big concern other than nuclear war is the international opinion on the invasion. Russia has been crying for nearly a decade that NATO made a coup in Ukraine and that’s why they annexed Crimea blah blah… NATO troops on the ground wouldnt mean they are right, but it would give Russia a lot more propaganda material. 

Again about the perception of the world, American invasion of Iraq and Afganistan are deeply unpopular today. They were colossal failures in terms of international opinion of countries and their people. I am sure the US wants to keep a low profile, making sure that any escalation is the work of Russians. 

Look at the situation now: it is Ukraine who is fighting, it is Ukraine who is beating Russian army to a pulp. It is the heroic story of a people standing up against the tyrannical Russia. If it was NATO that was winning, it wouldnt create such support for the war against Russia. 

So I believe there are more reasons not to directly intervene in Ukraine other than nukes. These reasons stem from bad reputation gained over decades with the Vietnam War, invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. Not to mention covert US interventions around the world. US supported Saddam against Iran for example although not sure how much. There are a ton of interventions by US to support one group among others, only for the said group to turn out bad. All these bad results create a general anti US sentiment around the globe. Some of you may not realize that, but I am from Turkey and everyone and their cats and dogs despise the US at least a little bit. I am sure it’s the same with a lot of non-NATO countries. 

And I dont think people’s perception of US is right. Look at Russia: Afghanistan, Georgia, Ukraine… their direct wars, all resulting in worse failure than US failures. Other interventions: Syria, Libya, various places in Africa.. It is always the worse side they support; the tyrants and the extremists. Still, in Turkey, we hate on US much more than we do on Russia.

You don't magically fix supply and logistics issues. At best in a short time frame you can stop-gap them.

Russia was always better able to supply itself in the South and East, we observed this early on.

If they've poured more troops into the East as we have been seeing from different sources, these should strain the logistics further.

Whether they'll break entirely, we don't know.

But what we do know is that Russia's forces are degrading at a remarkable rate. If even at a significantly reduced rate from this moment forward (unlikely if fighting intensifies) Russia's forces will become largely combat ineffective, and in some areas even defensively so.

Honestly the only way I see this even going semi-positively for Russia is if Ukraine has run out of key weapon systems or ammunition; e.g. artillery.

But while I think that's possible, the rate at which they're still destroying enemy armour may make the question about artillery moot.

It's not a direct fear of escalation: it's the necessity of being ABLE to escalate further. If every possible sanction is applied from the beginning, it is impossible for the Russian situation to worsen beyond that point. 

By imposing sanction after sanction, you can stagger the impact imposed week after week in the news cycle and force more Russians to question why this is happening to them. Additionally, you make it harder for individuals and businesses to adjust because every time they find their footing it just gets worse. 

If it were all done at once, they would just unite against it as they did with the first wave of sanctions.

Russia is likely to collapse as Putin has made himself indispensable. The government cannot function without him. Putin has also appointed people according to their loyalty to him and not due to their qualifications, experience and suitability. Julia mentioned Putin has rewarded his own bodyguards and chefs with various government jobs because of their loyalty.  

But why a Putin v2.0? Because the entire system would need to change or you'll keep getting Putin clones. I doubt anyone but a ruthless dictatorial tyrant would survive long in a position of power in Russia. They'd be eaten alive or used as a puppet and then discarded when it's convenient. Those in power won't want to change the system. I think the system would actively fight against any attempts to change it.  

As for the war ending when Putin dies, Julia said it's quite possible the war would just continue as it did in Afghanistan. In fact Julia mentioned there's a small but loud ultra nationalistic faction who believe all the pro-Russia war propaganda. They believe not just that the war can be won, but that nothing short of total conquest is acceptable! She said they really are baying for blood.  

She went on to say that Putin can deal with the anti-war faction, but the pro-war faction could cause Putin a headache in the future if he cannot control it. Look at it this way, a loudly vocal faction which brands anyone a traitor to Russia and a Nazi sympathiser who so much as suggests Russia cannot win with a total conquest has the potential to damage Putin or anyone else who may even talk of a truce or peace deal.  

Sure, we already know Putin really does believe he can win. But, this faction could potentially damage his public image as a strong patriotic man if he showed weakness by labelling him as an impotent weakling who is a traitor to Russia and afraid of Nazis or does deals with them.  

That blood thirsty faction, along with everyone else who believes the Kremlin propaganda, makes it hard for any leader, regardless of whether they believe the propaganda or not, to do anything but continue with the war.  

How could they spin it as mission accomplished with only part of the territory taken and the Ukrainian government and all those so-called Nazis the Russian propaganda has been screaming about still at large?",False,1650853525.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i62mhrf,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

\-As BlatantConservative said, it serves as part of balance of powers against the Executive Branch

\-historically the guard served as a territorial defense against local incursions

\-it serves as a jobs program and an alternative to conscription.  Many people can handle training, then a few days a month of service, and maybe a few weeks if something big goes down, but may not be inclined to a full military career.  People who are in the Nat Guard don't have to leave their home area to serve, so you don't get shipped off to the opposite coast for 3-4 years, which, in a country as polarized as the states, is probably a big plus.

\-the national guard acts as a backstop to police in some extreme situations of security.  For example, Jan 6 *should* have seen the immediate deployment of the MD national guard, but it was delayed because of Trump's cronies.  If I recall, the US military can't operate aggressively in its own country in some circumstances whereas the national guard can (but don't @ me, I'm not an expert on it).  Like the national guard enforced desegregation in the 1960s there.

\-they perform disaster relief missions in the states.  In 2020 they did a lot of hospital support, 2021 it was administering vaccines at local health centers

\-in times of need of manpower the federal military can call up national guard units.  This lets the federal military be more lean & rapid response, keeping that ""tip of the spear"" effect.

Despite claims of Ukrainian abuses and war crimes over the last 8 years, they didn't invite any outside observers or investigators then either.

Now, anyone who is in doubt should ask themselves why. Why would the Russian regime not want anyone else to see what's happening in areas they have occupied? The answer is obvious: They are full of shit, and they are committing war crimes and genocide themselves.

We've seen the deliberate targeting and destruction of civilians and civilian buildings and infrastructure. We've seen the mass graves popping up in all Russian occupied areas. We've seen how they leave their own soldiers behind to either die or be taken prisoner. And we've heard the increasingly dehumanizing, sick rhetoric from both the regime and their propagandists.

With the amount of physical evidence and credible witness statements we all have access to now regarding other types of war crimes, why is it so hard to believe mass deportation is going on?

&#x200B;

\>Just 15 days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush invited his defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, to meet with him alone in the Oval Office. According to Mr. Rumsfeld’s new memoir, the president leaned back in his leather chair and ordered a review and revision of war plans — but not for Afghanistan, where the Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington had been planned and where American retaliation was imminent.“He asked that I take a look at the shape of our military plans on Iraq,” Mr. Rumsfeld writes.

&#x200B;

\>With the intelligence all pointing toward bin Laden, Rumsfeld ordered the military to begin working on strike plans. And at 2:40 p.m., the notes quote Rumsfeld as saying he wanted ""best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit S.H."" – meaning Saddam Hussein – ""at same time. Not only UBL"" – the initials used to identify Osama bin Laden. Now, nearly one year later, there is still very little evidence Iraq was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. But if these notes are accurate, that didn't matter to Rumsfeld. ""Go massive,"" the notes quote him as saying. ""Sweep it all up. Things related and not.""

Gutting Russia like a fish economically will only result in further instability and radicalizations, ie what happened in German post WW1.

Ukraine deserves compensation for the rebuilding and a lot of that can be provided through seized assets, force the Russian populace to see their “Russian world” like the Germans were after WW2 and reconfigure the economy to provide for the people and remove corruption.  Total Occupation of Russia would be damn near impossible but territorial concessions (returning Crimea and revoking all claims on “independent republics”) are reasonable.  I think doing this, providing absolute guarantees to free media, information, and education will inevitably liberalize Russia, like they were potentially able to do after the USSR fell.  End goal in a perfect world?  Total restoration of Ukraine borders pre-2014, Russia finally liberalizes and they and Ukraine join the EU and peace in Europe finally restored.  

Destroying Russian sovereignty would be a quick way to prolong the suffering, but allowing it to develop with limited influence of the West could be possible, since even under Putin’s fist, some Russians are still resisting.  But the only way that spreads is if Russia is not an impoverished agrarian/poorly industrialized nation (like what everything is past St. Petersburg and Moscow now) because those regions are the most hardline Putin.  Right now, yes, burn their economy, tank their war effort, and cut the ties, but after the collapse, should it happen, the West will need to restore some form of relations on certain conditions and guarantees such as free press and government transparency if we don’t want to be in this situation again in 20 years.",False,1650858701.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i6311vx,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Not taking any Russian territory would mean Russia could continue shelling Ukraine.  The Kursk-Belgorod rail line is a major supply line for Russian forces and separatists.

Germany circled around in WW2.  Cut east of Rostov.  Crimea would be extremely difficult to take.  Circling around the sea of Azov cuts off the Kerch connection.

Wars need to be opposed.  There is a sizable Ukrainian pacifist movement.  We should support them. Give them more air time.  

 Sometimes there is some limited value to the outside perspective.  Russians want sea ports.  Does that mean Ukraine has to cede territory?  Why does Russia get to expect that its boundaries cannot be violated but that it can invade neighbors whenever it sees fit to do so?  War has plenty of horror.  It may help if nations face the risk of losing territory when they make attacks.  Ukraine did not decide to annex Russian territory.  Russia started a war and it went poorly.  Perfectly reasonable to expect Moscow to grovel and beg for forgiveness.  The frontier can still be in Russia but demilitarized if Ukraine decides that is best.

-24 I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line ""No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!"" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)

-88 If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.

-91 I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It might actually be important.

Also many people can't distinguish evil as in utter selfishness and disregard for others with the evil of kicking puppies for no reason.

The evil overlord list is all about how to do the 1st well, and warns about the second.

-33 I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code. Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for formal occasions.

-48 I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge.

-54 I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to double-cross it simply because I feel like being contrary.

-68 I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one time only. If they want me to spare them again, they'd better save my life again.

-100 Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access.

1. Towed guns
2. Self-propelled guns (SPG)

The difference being that Towed artillery pieces must be 'towed' behind a truck or other vehicle. They cannot move on their own; they have no engine. This means it takes a bit longer to set up, and there is no protection to the crew.

Whereas SPGs can move on their own. This allows them to be set up more quickly. Allowing them to do a technique where they ""shoot and scoot"" (shoot a few shells and then move to another possition to avoid return fire). Within the realm of SPGs there are also differences. Some SPGs feature armored compartments and are mounted on a tracked vehicle. Others are mounted on wheeled vehicles, such as trucks.

Some examples are:

Bob accidentally won the provincial election and was suddenly in charge of Ontario Canada our largest province by population.

Bob had some very interesting plans for the province and at the time they were very radical. Bob ran a massive deficit. He got into wars with strong unions who backed him, but he realized they also had too much power.  Especially the teachers Union. (don't get me started about the teachers... They will surely be here down voting me I don't care... A very large percentage of Canadians see them as whiny spoiled little children because how dare people point out they have a very nice pay, pension and benefits package for the amount of work they do, when we all have hard jobs with none of their benefits, pay, work hours and time off and it's hard to see their problems as real problems in that context) 

Bob was run out of town real hard in the next election. 

But a funny thing seems to have happened over the past 25+ years... His policies he put in place aged quite well and the direction he set is interesting decades later. 

Bob resurfaced is now a member of the federal liberal party (more 'centre' than the left party he ran in the province) and our diplomat to the UN. 


He's actually a very astute and sincere politician. I've spent several full days with Bob and his provincial finance minister in golf carts 15+ years ago and while they really had some thought times while in charge of the province and he was the person that everyone hated at the time... But now in context of history and in present day decades later he seems actually to be one of the more reasonable and rational people in politics in Canada and now that I'm typing this knowing people spent decades hating him and when I say hate I mean HATE, I'd actually vote for him if he cared to run for leadership of the Liberal party (who Justin Trudeau is leader of... Because Trudeau is an entitled little selfish insincere person fumbling along).

Bob. Interesting guy.

Edit: I hadn't really thought about Bob in the context of 'hey what if he was our next Prime minister?' until I typed this out, because I have never thought about it. But as I formulated this comment it occurred to me he'd have my vote, hands down.

He's *reasonable* and yes many would hate him but he isn't selfish or ego driven, and I can count on one hand the number of Canadia politicians who were actually sincere and still have most of my fingers available for counting. And like or hate his policies, he certainly didn't chance the vote by just doing what was popular. He did what was unpopular but needed to be done. (in hindsight).

Again just formulating a thought here that popped into my head but I'd LOVE to see what  Bob Rae and Jagmeet Singh could do working together as party leaders and PM of Canada. (Jagmeet Singh is the current leader of the Federal NDP party who ironically is the party at the provincial level that Bob won the election as leader of. He also is a sincere person and very very interesting. )

When I say all this please note - I'm not really a lefty. I hate all politicians by default and need convincing otherwise. I just want someone sincere and honest running my country. It's hard to find anyone like that here they're all a bunch of house leaguers/ bench warmers/lightweights.",1650814222.0,1650813104.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i6078cc,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

>Poland claims that 100 T-72M1Rs have been stolen by 'thieves' and an official investigation is underway into their loss. Many believe it to be a cover story for these tanks to be sent to Ukraine, particularly given they were just upgraded. Particularly when the Polish authorities said they were headed Eastward and an investigation into their theft would occur after the summer holidays. Photos on social media show the tanks on trucks head eastward on Polish highways.

 >Rashism or Ruscism (Russian: Рашизм, romanized: Rashizm, pronounced [rɐˈʂɨzm]; a portmanteau of ""Russia"" and ""fascism""; Ukrainian: рашизм, romanized: rashyzm), formerly known as Russism (Russian: Русизм), is both an assertion that Russia has been transformed into a fascist country and a name of an ideology of Great Russia or Russian military expansionism. That transformation was described as based on the ideas of the ""special civilizational mission"" of the Russians, such as Moscow as the third Rome and expansionism. This is also a claim widely used to identify supporters of Russian military aggression.

The conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia, as part of the Coal Wars, a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Up to 100 people were killed, and many more arrested. The United Mine Workers temporarily saw declines in membership, but the long-term publicity led to improvements in membership and working conditions in the mines.

 >The Russian nihilist movement was a philosophical, cultural, and revolutionary movement in the Russian Empire during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which was the precursor to broader forms of the philosophy of nihilism. In Russian, the word nigilizm (Russian: нигилизм; meaning 'nihilism', from Latin  nihil 'nothing at all') came to represent the movement's negation of pre-existing ideals. Even as it was yet unnamed, the movement arose from a generation of young radicals disillusioned with the social reformers of the past, and from a growing divide between the intelligentsia of the genteel and non-genteel social classes.

The soviet operation in Korea was not covert.  Soviet pilots were captured.  The same happened in Vietnam where Soviet operatives were taken as POWs.

In Syria, Turkey also shot down a Russian fighter (intentionally).  

As I said to the other poster, I don't believe NATOs lack of intervention means they think the threat is credible.  There are many reasons to not intervene (including several member states being close to important elections, germany's reliance of Russia fossil fuels and the potential Chinese wildcard).

As I also said, IF NATO does determine the risk to be credible they won't act.  I am merely hypothesizing that NATO action might give Putin an out and that the out would arguably be the cleanest available to him at this point.

It is also POSSIBLE that not acting might lead to nuclear exchanges too.  Putin might get so bogged down in Ukraine with no political out that he uses a tactical nuke, which the US has already said would drag them in.

Both sides of this coin have risk.  People need to acknowledge both.

Then you fire the Drone CPU cluster off with dozens of other drones to an known area where Russians are.  The drones are programmed to go after certain targets and get coordinated from the AI unit in the central drone that uses lazers relays to coordinate with other drones in the battlepspace.  You then set the drones to initiate attacks at certain times.   lets say 15 minutes after you launch.  The other drones feed information to the central one which then relays targetting instructions through machine learning on what the kill priority list would be through image recognition.

Not sure how it'll be different. Maybe a smaller warhead to get longer loiter time and range? Which means they can operate further away from the front lines.

My pet theory is that they have built-in laser designators which can be used to direct Excalibur rounds fired from the M777s we're sending.

With regard to the capacity for reassessing major relationships, let’s take a look at Russia. I know that many of you made your careers working on dossiers whose every aspect fostered a mistrust of Russia, sometimes rightly so. And since the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have structured our relationship on the basis of that mistrust, through a series of misunderstandings. In wishing to revisit that relationship I am in no way naive. But there are some obvious reasons for doing so. We are part of Europe; so is Russia. And if we are unable to accomplish anything useful with Russia at any given time, we will remain in a state of deeply unproductive tension. We will continue to be stuck in conflicts throughout Europe. Europe will continue to be the theatre of a strategic battle between the United States and Russia, with the consequences of the Cold War still visible on our soil. And we will not lay the groundwork for the profound recreation of European civilization that I mentioned earlier. Because we cannot do that without reassessing in depth, in great depth, our relationship with Russia. I also think that pushing Russia away from Europe is a major strategic error, because we are pushing it either toward isolation, which heightens tensions, or toward alliances with other great powers such as China, which would not at all be in our interest. At the same time, it must be said that while our relations have been based on mistrust, there are documented reasons for it. We’ve witnessed cyber-attacks, the destabilization of democracies, and a Russian project that is deeply conservative and opposed to the EU project. And all that basically developed in the 1990s and 2000s when a series of misunderstandings took place, and when Europe no doubt did not enact its own strategy and gave the impression of being a Trojan Horse for the West, whose final aim was to destroy Russia, and when Russia built a fantasy around the destruction of the West and the weakening of the EU. That is the situation. We can deplore it, we can continue to jockey for position, but it is not in our best interest to do so. Nor is it in our interest to show a guilty weakness toward Russia and to believe that we should forget all the disagreements and past conflicts, and fall into each other’s arms. No. But I believe we must very carefully rethink the fundamentals. **I believe we must build a new architecture based on trust and security in Europe, because the European continent will never be stable, will never be secure, if we do not ease and clarify our relations with Russia.** That is not in the interest of some of our allies, let’s be clear about that. **Some of them will urge us to impose more sanctions on Russia because it is in their interest. Even though they are our friends. But it is most certainly not in ours.** And I believe that to achieve the goal that I just mentioned, that is, to rebuild a real European project in a world that is at risk of bipolarization, to succeed at forming a common front between the EU and Russia, it is vital to think of those concentric circles that are structuring Europe and creating a new relationship with Russia. To achieve this, as I said to President Putin last week in Brégançon, we must move forward one step at a time. Each day you will see evidence that we are not moving in that direction. That will be the case each day, because actors on both sides, including the Russian side, will try to undermine this project; because there are many actors in the services, in the economic sector, who will try to disrupt this effort through attacks and provocations.",False,1650829236.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i61dymp,,2,-1,0,-1,0,0,

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1,000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. The handling of the crisis by Vladimir Putin, who was prime minister at the time, boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months. The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and in Moscow on 9 and 13 September.

However, their concerns haven’t been addressed/dealt with by the regular politicians for years, so mainly they’re feeling angry and scared, which is a bad combination.

But it seems the mainstream just wants to belittle them instead of actually addressing the problem (middle class is shrinking/worse off) which is *absolutely* a legit concern.  So instead of addressing the actual problem, we marginalize and belittle an already angry group of people…and then we wonder how they get crazy and radicalized.

Don’t get me wrong, there’s always some innately bad people and crazy people out there, which is some of LePen/Trump’s base, but the majority seems to be relatively normal-ish people with legit concerns who have been radicalized…so…why not address those concerns instead of making them worse?  It kinda baffles me, unless the answer is that there is no solution to those concerns (unless the government comes down hard on business and the super rich…which in America, they will never, ever do.

Do I think a “regular” politician could get through?  Absolutely, but they have to acknowledge the anger to move past it.  “The middle class in America is angry, and it has every reason to be.  In the last 50 years [insert some facts].  However, things don’t have to be that way.  When I’m elected, I’m going to [insert goals].”

I think something like that has the potential to be very successful.  However, if nobody in the room is addressing the anger, most people are going to be swayed by the guy who does, even if logically, they shouldn’t vote for that guy.

I’m guessing no (sane) politician has done that either because there is no (easy) solution to the problem of the middle class, or because doing that is a fast way to lose all your donors (actually helping the middle class will probably involve some measure of sticking it to big business and the rich).

This is false. You cannot set fire to a residential building by hacking normal computers. Please dont believe any fantasy novel lol.

It may be possible to cause malfunctions or overloads on a Smart UPS system or SCADA/ICS/IoT SoC systems. however, 99% of the time those are isolated networks(air gapped), and not reachable from any public WAN.

The only way I see the fire tonight being a hack is if the ICS system involved in managing the Valves in the oil pumps are accessible from WAN, and are vulnerable. Which most times ICS systems are vulnerable as they are propriety and patches are few and far between.

That's only if the system is not air gapped, which goes against every staandard available and would be a complete lapse of infrastructure security.

When yakov tried to kill himself by shooting himself in the heart because Stalin basically forbid him from marry a girl he feel in love with, his shot was just off and he managed to barely survive.

What was Stalin's response to this? upon hearing about his son's failed suicide attempt he is quoted as saying ""He can't even shoot straight""

Yakov spent a great chunk of his life extremely depressed and suicidal along with trying consistently to Garner his father's love. Apparently he was captured because he refused to retreat, saying ""I am the son of Stalin and I do not allow the battery to retreat"". He was a lieutenant in charge of an artillery battery. Though other stories say his men turned him over or he surrendered willingly.

 Stalin was obviously not happy about this, especially since he himself had ordered that Soviet troops should fight to the death. When the Germans tried to trade for his son, Stalin refused every offer, specifically stating when they offered yakov for field marshal plalus ""Just think how many sons ended up in camps! Who would swap them for Paulus? Were they worse than Yakov?"". Even rejecting the fairly generous ones such as trading for an officer of equal rank. 

It was only when his son died in German captivity that Stalin seemed to even mildly regret the way he treated him, apparently saying ""He was a real man"" and ""fate treated him cruelly"".

Nobody is entirely sure why Stalin had particular ire for yakov. He was not exactly a loving father, especially to his other sons who he basically ignored and left to be raised by nannies, but he only seemed to truly despise Yakov. Some think it is because he was the last child of Stalin's beloved first wife, and Stalin blamed him for her death since childbirth had weakened her and made her more susceptible to the sickness that killed her, others think it was because of yakovs meek personality that Stalin found unfitting of his oldest son. Nobody is really sure.

It's important to not feel to bad for yakov. He was openly anti-Semitic despite his wifes family having Jewish roots, and saw the nazis as preferable to the British.

Most people don't pay attention to politics. They look at how things are going for them personally and elect someone else if they are frustrated. They don't necessarily pay attention to who that ""someone else"" is; they just show up at the polls and vote against the incumbent. Sometimes they just vote for the name they recognize.

If they do pay attention to politics, it's through the news media. It's the stuff that shows up on the front page of MSN News when they log into Outlook. It's the stuff that's put on in the doctor's office or what's on the TV in the background. Despite constant claims that they are against ""mainstream media"", Fox News is the largest news broadcaster out there and statistically the most likely to be on someone's TV. This combines with the stuff they see in everyday life - high gas prices, inflation, COVID restrictions - and creates a narrative that ""the guys in power are doing a bad job, get rid of them.""

When the Dems try to pass legislation but get blocked by Manchin and Sinema, very few people (percentage-wise) are actually paying attention. They just see promises made but not kept. This is why Biden not using the bully pulpit is going to come back to haunt him; he's trying to return to normal and do things the ""correct"" way, yet people don't care if you did things via Congress or via executive order. Trump has opened Pandora's Box, but Biden is acting as if the box is still closed. People think that you aren't doing anything at all, and if the government collectively does nothing then individually they're useless.

Anyone who's actually paying attention can go ""oh, but-"" and go off about how that's a common misconception... but the point of a common misconception is that _most people believe it._ Most people don't care if you're correcting them, because it doesn't fit in their bubble. They trust the stuff in their bubble because they've accepted it as the truth; you are saying something else so you are a liar. They won't do research to back it up.

The end result? ""Feels, not reals."" It's why ""truthiness"" is so powerful; if something feels like it _should_ be true, it must be true. So the goal isn't to tell the truth; it's to make people feel that your arguments _should_ be true. There's media conglomerates and state actors interfering to do just that.

Europe actually wants to be friends with Russia, but they're spineless and are directly controlled and occupied by the US (just look at all those military bases).

The whole world actually really hates it but they're too afraid of the US to speak up. The West is also by far not the whole world, China, India and the Arabic countries stand with us. The sanctions are also stupid because they don't really hurt us but Europe depends on us so much that the sanctions will be their undoing.

Tank's frontal armor makes them immune to 30mm cannons and smaller. Furthermore, the Tank gun can destroy any enemy target in just one shot, and can repeatedly  (and cheaply) destroy entrenched positions (ex: blast holes into a house where people are hiding).

To single them out as somehow different is dangerous and part of why it happens over and over again - because wars are fought by you and me, regular people indoctrinated into it.

But yes, I've maintained that this would have been a vastly different fight if Rasmussen was around instead of Stoltenberg. Biden is trying to keep the alliance marching at the same pace, so we can't just act unilaterally like we could have 8 years ago. But IMO Rasmussen would've been more aggressive. (That's just my opinion though, take it was as much salt as you'd like to) 

Breedlove actually lamented that Obama wasn't focused on Ukraine because he felt that it was the start of something worse, he said we should have built the coalition to contain Russia and if/when that didn't work we should have hit them hard and moved on our own. To him he felt that the delays diluted our responses.

He didn't feel NS2 was as big a deal as everyone else did, but he said that the Russian willingness to weaponize their energy was something that Europe needed to avoid.

There are probably better systems, but the thing that makes democracy so good isn’t what you think it is.

Yes, having a government that undergoes a regular peaceful revolution at the ballot box is important, but it’s the separation of power that is paramount.

The army is separate to the government.

The courts are separate to the government.

The police are separate to army.

The media is independent from the government.

The electoral process is separate to the government.

All of these things are vitally important to maintaining a stable government.

No one has absolute power, and no one (except maybe criminals) is ever powerless.

It’s a system that puts a cap on power.

Many people make the mistake of confusing capitalism with democracy. Interestingly, pure capitalism is the biggest danger to  democracy. Anyone, including any business interest, who seeks unrestricted power is an enemy of democracy.

Which they have done any way to be honest, so hopefully they learn their lessons.

The problem is France has dreams of independent European greatness. Pushing for EU army etc. They keep seperate defence infrastructure from US. They see themselves as western, but not US western.

Germany are not as bad in the long term. Their interest aligns with France in that there is a stable European power bloc, they tried to do that with Russia now in hind sight naively. But who can blame Germany with their past, to try economically for cohesion and peace. That doesn't mean they are at odds with us.

>Reuters: Men and women in Ukraine have been beaten, electrocuted by their genitals and raped in cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict which may amount to war crimes, the United Nations’ human rights office said on Thursday.All sides in the unrest used beatings, forced nudity and other abuses as interrogation techniques to extract confessions from victims or force them to hand over property, the U.N. human rights office said in a report.

>Human Rights Watch: All sides appeared to have also used cluster munitions, a weapon with indiscriminate, wide-area effects that is banned under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions. All sides should stop using weapons such as Grad rockets in populated areas, as they have indiscriminate impact, and altogether stop using cluster munitions. Both Ukraine and Russia should join the Convention on Cluster Munitions, Human Rights Watch said... “All sides of the conflict have committed grave violations of human rights,” Gorbunova said.

I think it really goes by priority now, logistics aren't a joke I guess, you have to do the things that are most useful first. Why make public something that you can't deliver yet anyway, because they are still training, you will just get roasted by media again 

Also if you check the abandoned/captured vehicle stats, Russia is Ukraine's biggest supplier right now, helping them with spare parts and maintaining those vehicles is also not wrong for immediate effect.

It was quickly clear that I was not going to achieve that,” Holland wrote in a statement about the project. “But I realized I could actually meet their peers.

The cold war has ended 30 years ago. Besides the US as a global hegemonial power pumping a fuckton of money into its military-industrial complex there hasnt been any need for large scale production of arms - especially in europe. Replacing germanys Panzerhaubitzen if they were to be delivered to ukraine would take 30 months for the first delivery of units according to the manufacturer.

> Probably months at most. 

If you declare war and start focussing your entire economy that statement *could* hold true. But even in that case it would be too late for this war.

> Every country has plans on increasing arms manufacture rapidly during a crisis.

Not really. That was the case during the cold war (where way larger quantities of arms were regularily purchased), but not today after 30 years of active disarmament. Not only is there very few spending on purchasing new stuff - even the european military doctrins arent really focussed on fighting countries like russia, but are more aimed at international UN missions. Whichever plans may have existend will have been neglected for 30 years

 Again, since the US has an insane military spending the situation there may be different, but not in europe. As you can observe in russia not even the party which knew that war was coming years ago is really able to ramp up its production (yeah sure, there are sanctions, but even without those it wouldnt be possible).",1650816324.0,1650816117.0,t3_uama2x,t1_i60h3li,,6,0,0,0,0,0,

America is certainly not an exception to that. That explains the few crazies who compared us to Russians, or were gleeful about the death tolls we had during COVID. We have haters, I do not dispute that.

But given the circumstances lately, it's absolutely no comparison to the absolute vitriol directed towards Russians because of Ukraine. Of course there are people who want Americans dead, but it's not even CLOSE to the amount of people who want Russians to die, nor even close to the depth of their hatred. Are you really trying to make the point that people on this site abhor Americans as much as Russians right now? Have you not seen the condemnation globally, in every strata of human society from virtually every nation due to recent events?

The US has hit, multiple times, Russian forces or allied forces in strafing runs. We don’t get MAD over that. It’s not NATO entering a Russian war with front line troops. Ostensibly what you’re seeing now is the comparable of a proxy war, with Ukraine being the proxy of the West. 

This is more in line with historical confrontations between the two a la Vietnam. Russia fought US forces via proxies (North Vietnam) and third party aid. Now it’s Russia against Ukraine being supported by the West.

> Russia had THOUSANDS of assets in Vietnam.  

Russia had roughly three thousand in Vietnam and was not running their forces anywhere near frontlines. There is nothing to support the claim of more.

Again, both sides have been very careful to have direct confrontation with the other. Nukes would not be launched over a soviet plane making a bombing run or being shot down. Nukes would be at a real threat of being launched should NATO forces engage in large scale battles, depending on the escalation steps. 

That doesn’t mean you necessarily get MAD, but tactical nuke usage would indeed be a threat depending on Russian casualties rates and position of NATO troops relative to Russia’s own borders.

 >The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), is a Christian extremist and a terrorist organization which operates in northern Uganda, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was founded in 1987 by Joseph Kony during the Ugandan civil war. It aims for the establishment of multi-party democracy, Christian rule in Uganda, and Acholi nationalism. Originally known as the Uganda Christian Army, in practice ""the LRA is not motivated by any identifiable political agenda, and its military strategy and tactics reflect this"".
