He then said that a deal had been struck and that Wagner’s forces were turning around to avoid bloodshed. Apparently, however, the blood Prigozhin saved from being shed was his own. If the “deal” announced by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accurately reflects an actual settlement, Prigozhin has in the space of a day gone from being a powerful warlord to a man living on borrowed time in a foreign country, waiting for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inevitable retribution.
>
>According to Peskov, Russia is dropping all charges against Prigozhin, who must now go into exile in Belarus. Wagner fighters who did not take part in the rebellion will be given amnesty, and then they will sign contracts that will bring them under the control of Shoigu’s Ministry of Defense. I suggested yesterday that Shoigu’s attempt to seize Wagner’s men and dissolve the force might be one of the reasons Prigozhin went on the march. This outcome is a defeat of the first order for Prigozhin, who has now lost everything except his life.
>
>Nonetheless, this bizarre episode is not a win for Putin. The Russian dictator has been visibly wounded, and he will now bear the permanent scar of political vulnerability. Instead of looking like a decisive autocrat (or even just a mob boss in command of his crew), Putin left Moscow after issuing a short video in which he was visibly angry and off his usual self-assured game. Putin reportedly worries a great deal about being assassinated, and so perhaps he wanted to hunker down until he had more clarity about who might be in league with Prigozhin. But whatever the reason, he vowed to deal with Prigozhin decisively and then blew town, probably to his retreat at Valdai, in a move that looked weak and disorganized.
>
>Bringing in President Alexander Lukashenko as a broker at first seemed an odd choice on Putin’s part, but it makes a bit more sense in light of the supposed deal. The Belarusian autocrat could personally vouch for Prigozhin’s safe passage; Lukashenko has no connections in Moscow that are more important than Putin; he does not live or work in the Kremlin and so he was a secure choice to carry out Putin’s terms; he owes Putin his continued rule and has no reason to betray him. Also, sending in Lukashenko was something of a power move: Putin is a former intelligence officer, and in that world, Prigozhin is merely a scummy convict. The two men were friendly before this, but they were not equals. It would have been a huge loss of face for the president of a great power to negotiate with his former chef in person.
>
>Prigozhin gets to stay alive, at least for the moment, but his life as he knew it (and maybe in any sense) is over. Putin, however, is now politically weaker than ever. The once unchallengeable czar is no longer invincible. The master of the Kremlin had to make a deal with a convict—again, in Putin’s culture, among the lowest of the low—just to avert the shock and embarrassment of an armed march into the Russian capital while other Russians are fighting on the front lines in Ukraine.

2.

Some possible outcomes of yesterday's events:   
  
1. In Wagner PMC, a split has reportedly started between those who felt used and those who remained loyal to Prigozhin after the failed rebellion.  
  
2. Combat pilots reportedly quit Wagner PMC due to their disagreement with the way planes and helicopters of the Russian Aerospace Forces were destroyed yesterday.  
  
3. A vertical of power has collapsed.   
No one in Russia can feel safe anymore. Neither officials, nor oligarchs, nor FSB officers who used to think they were the rulers of life. Putin stopped holding a monopoly on violence in Russia yesterday.  It was proven that factions with more weapons and determination decide everything.   
  
4. Russia might be facing a bloody war, not a civil war, but a war of clans, armed groups and private armies: Chechens, Prigozhin's supporters, armed mercenaries, who will separate from Prigozhin or other PMCs and be hired by local clans for protection from invading outsiders.   
All large business and oligarchs will probably create (if they haven't already) private armies, as Gazprom has already done to protect itself.   
Conflicts and redistribution of property will be resolved by force. It will be the new 90s but far worse - Resembling the Mad Max style and genre of an anti-utopia action movie.  
  
5. The Russian army, it seems, has de facto ceased to exist as a united structure. Soldiers and officers sitting in trenches in the massacre unleashed by Putin, probably finally realized yesterday the utter pointlessness of the war against Ukraine, against the background of the fact that a group of criminals in the rear can pass 600km in a day, sweeping away everything in their path and then be amnestied after killing pilots and civilians.   
  
6. Ukraine is a few steps closer to fully restoring its territorial integrity, including Crimea.  
  
7. What a pity that this circus did not end with the self-destruction of Putin's regime and Prigozhin faction.

For one, and we may not know the extent of this for several days, but Ukraine was probably able to take advantage of the day's chaos to make some gains that will open up a lot of options as the counteroffensive continues to develop. And this was the perfect time to have any such luck, because every step forward now brings Ukraine fairly close to effectively turning the entire southern front into a siege.

Also, this went a long way toward showing the weakness of the Putler regime. Regular Russians and despondent conscripts now know that it's very possible to make them shit their pants and back away from confrontation. The illusion that the FSB will make planning any rebellions impossible has been shattered. Wagner troops who feel betrayed and other Russians who feel that they need an alternative will now have options in the Freedom of Russia Legion, the Russian Volunteer Corps, and possibly Belarus, assuming Prigozhin makes it there. Russian morale was already pretty much at zero, and now it's about to head toward negative numbers, with more than a few people eagerly plotting against Putler and co. Expect to also see more acts of defiance and revenge toward Rosgvardia, Chechens, and other forces that play a similar role in suppressing Russian troops.

And lastly, this just took Russia's most successful combat group completely off the board, diminished as it may have been after Bakhmut. Even if Wagner soldiers are absorbed by the Ministry of Defense and sent to the frontlines, they won't be nearly as effective as they were working together under Wagner, because it just won't be the same organization running things, and they certainly won't be allowed to work together in substantial numbers.",False,1687667963.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,223,0,223,0,0,

Zygar is a former editor-in-chief of TV Rain (known as Dozhd in Russian) an independent channel that Putin closed after the start of the war. 
>
>When I asked Zygar what was the most striking aspect of the uprising, he said, “Putin is weaker. I have the feeling he is not really running the country. Certainly, not the way he once did. He is still President, but all the different clans”—the factions within the government, the military, and, most important, the security services—“now have the feeling that ‘Russia after Putin’ is getting closer. Putin is still alive. He is still there in his bunker. But there is the growing feeling that he is a lame duck, and they have to prepare for Russia after Putin.”
>
>In ideological terms, Zygar said, “Prigozhin combines two ideas. The first is anti-corruption and anti-oligarch. Despite his own wealth, which is immense, he always portrayed himself as the oligarch-fighter. At the same time, he is super illiberal. He hates the West, and he claims to be the real protector of traditional values. He probably has more supporters beyond the Wagner Group; there are people in the Army, the F.S.B., the Interior Ministry, who could be his ideological allies.”
>
>“Prigozhin has a distinct background,” Zygar said. “He speaks the way prisoners speak. He is the average guy. He went the same way that Putin did twenty years ago when politicians, in 1999, were very old and looked dead and Soviet. They couldn’t speak the language of the people. Putin spoke like a gangster, like a gopnik, like someone from the Leningrad slums. That was a cultural coup—a guy who knows the problems of the simple people. Prigozhin has come along and has followed that pattern in an even more brutal way.”
>
>“Before this rebellion, there were a lot of rumors and theories about different clans supporting Prigozhin. There were rumors that he was supported by siloviki [security-service figures] in business like Igor Sechin [the C.E.O. of the energy conglomerate Rosneft and a former Deputy Prime Minister] and Sergey Chemezov [the C.E.O. of the state-owned defense conglomerate, Rostec].”
>
>Zygar went on, “The F.S.B. [a successor to the K.G.B.] and G.R.U. [military intelligence] is not a single clan; it is a mixture of different clans, and we will see how they are going to react. For years, Putin has selected his inner circle with only one criterion: a lack of ambition. They are not the best of the best. They are the worst of the worst. So how will such mediocrities face up to one desperately brave person, or a desperately brave group of terrorists? We will see.”

International talks held in Copenhagen to discuss Kyiv's 10-point peace plan to end Russia's invasion were ""constructive,"" Ukrainian President Zelensky's chief of staff said Sunday.

""I expressed my conviction that it (the plan) should be the basis for achieving a sustainable and just peace for Ukraine, as the war lingers in our territory,"" Andriy Yermak said in a series of tweets. 

Zelensky first presented Ukraine's 10-point peace formula to world leaders at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November.

The steps include a path to nuclear safety, food security, a special tribunal for alleged Russian war crimes and a final peace treaty with Moscow. He also urged G20 leaders to use all their power to “make Russia abandon nuclear threats” and implement a price cap on energy imported from Moscow.

Over the weekend, representatives from G7 countries and multiple nations in the global south met in Copenhagen to discuss the peace plan. The countries that joined the Ukrainian-led talks included India, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the European Union and the United States.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-25-23/index.html

""The United States has not seen a change to Russia's nuclear posture since Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin began his insurrection challenging the Kremlin's leadership, two US officials told CNN.

""We have not seen any changes in the disposition of Russian nuclear forces,"" a State Department spokesperson said, adding that the US has ""no reason to adjust our conventional or nuclear force posture. We have long-standing, established communication channels with Russia on nuclear issues.""

President Putin has repeatedly engaged in nuclear saber-rattling over the course of the Ukraine war. Putin said earlier this month that the first tactical nuclear weapons to be stored in Belarus had arrived. US President Joe Biden called the move ""absolutely irresponsible.""

The US has continued to monitor Russia's nuclear posture throughout the Ukraine War despite Russia this year suspending participation in the single lasting nuclear arms control treaty between the US and Russia. This has meant that the two nations are no longer sharing certain notifications with one another which were required under the treaty, including updates on the status or location of treaty-accountable items such as missiles and launchers.

""As a nuclear power, Russia has a special responsibility to maintain command, control, and custody of its nuclear forces and to ensure that no actions are taken that imperil strategic stability,"" the State Department spokesperson said.

And as the US continues to monitor the situation in Russia the US diplomatic presence in the country has remain unchanged. 

“Our embassy in Moscow remains open, we are in regular communication with it, and its operating posture remains the same at this time,” the spokesperson said.""",False,1687694625.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

______

[2]

Today, channel vchk-opgu wrote that Wagner had intended to arrest/kidnap Shoigu, who *had been* in Rostov—that that had been their plan.  


@vchkogpu

*Unclear if they got timing wrong, if abandoned plan, if caught and released*

[3]

Meanwhile, [*Medusa* and *UP* reported](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/news/2023/06/25/7408475/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui)
that Putin refused Progozhin’s calls, but also, Prigozhin calculated he did not have enough firepower to actually roll in to Moscow.  And with Prigozhin looking to be wavering mid afternoon, negotiations commenced, helmed by Patrushev.

[4]

Along with that, former head of operations for Russia for the CIA, Steve Hall tells C NN that Prigozhin paused because whoever his insider backers, Prigozhin assessed that they were not still going to help, his insider support dwindled. 

_____

[5]

Incidentally, Patrushev is who the analysts at @VolyaMedia have been attributing this entire event to—that he instigated it, essentially planting the idea for Prigozhin, but for his own reasons.  

[7]

Volya analysts longed pointed out that Prigozhin makes zero military moves (logistics, campaign planning, strategy), that that is done by the GRU.  [This source, too.](https://fakty-ua.translate.goog/ru/413702-prigozhin-formiruet-v-chvk-vagner-brigady-kotorye-v-chas-ch-budut-gotovy-k-reshitelnym-dejstviyam-vnutri-rossii?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
And while all this was going on, the GRU was still in communication.  (*Perhaps this should all be labeled a GRU mutiny?*)  

[8]

Further, that the removed Dep MOD Minister, General Mizintsev, remains a GRU Commander AND the head of Wagner in the field, and that HE was who organized the logistics of getting the vast array of Wagner to descend on Rostov, together with equipment and artillery, fieldmarshalling it all.  (VolyaMedia has long said his placement in Wagner is a ruse to get Wagner under the vertical of the MOD.)  They also posit that the second aim of this all was to get out of the southern part of Ukraine.  Essentially, tricking Prigozhin to be a fall guy, but ended up being stunned by the lengths progressed (like the downed aircraft).

[9]

Part of the reason there was essentially no resistance, according to VolyaMedia, was because there were GRU on both sides, Wagner *is* GRU, and that therefore weren’t interfering but just allowing to roll on in.  This is why it was a mutiny, ie, from within.  However, did get out of hand and wasn’t intended as a coup or a challenge directly on Putin.  Rather, as a takeover of Wagner, with the deadline looming. 

[10]

Supporting this theory is the just-published statements, in Russian state-controlled media:


> Chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, stated that he sees no reason to ban the Wagner private military company in Russia. He shared his opinion in an interview with *Vedomosti.*

>> ""Why should it be banned? All the issues came from the PMC leader. Joseph [Stalin] said that children are not responsible for their parents’ [behavior]. The one who initiated the rebellion should be held accountable,"" the deputy said.  

> Kartapolov referred to Wagner as the most combat-ready unit in the country today. 

>> ""To disarm and disband them would be the best gift to NATO and Ukrainians that one can think of. There's no need to do that [to disband],"" added the politician.

1. Moscow’s Red Square blocked off after Wagner insurrection: A CNN team observed Moscow’s Red Square blocked off on Sunday, a day after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin called off his short-lived insurrection. Metal partitions were seen blocking access to the city center and a few security officers were present. 

2. Pedestrians were walking on the streets next to the square. Red Square was also closed off on Saturday.
UN secretary general calls for deescalation: UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Sunday urged all parties involved “to act responsibly and with a view to avoid further tensions” in a statement released in response to recent events in Russia.

3. US secretary of state says the situation in Russia is extraordinary: ""First of all, what we've seen is extraordinary. And I think you've seen cracks emerge that weren't there before,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, citing in part Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin questioning the premise of Russia’s war in Ukraine. 

4. Biden urges allies to not give credibility to Putin's claims of Western interference: US President Joe Biden's primary objective following the Wagner insurrection in Russia has been denying Putin's pretext for accusing the West of wanting him dead. In a phone call with allies, Biden emphasized the imperative of not lending any credibility to expected claims from Putin of Western interference. Biden also reaffirmed the US commitment to Ukraine in a call with President 
Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, the White House said. They discussed the situation in Russia and Zelenksy later tweeted: “The world must put pressure on Russia until international order is restored.""

5. Zelensky consults with allies: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he has discussed the weekend’s events in Russia with several world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Polish President Andrzej Duda.

6. US expected ""a lot more bloodshed"" in Russia: As the picture became more clear to US intelligence analysts that Yevgeny Prigozhin was about to mobilize his Wagner troops inside Russia, the expectation was that his march toward Moscow would encounter much more resistance and be “a lot more bloody than it was.” There was a surprise, a US official said, that Russia’s professional military didn’t do a better job of confronting Wagner troops as they moved into Rostov and up toward Moscow.

7. Senior Russian diplomat visits Beijing: The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday issued a readout of a meeting in Beijing between Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Rudenko and China's top diplomats.

b182a0e2e9b1195b301ffdfab535fff5,14icclh,jpg0sot,"**Sorry in advance for the lengthy post, but yesterday's activity left me with a lot to think about.**

While yesterday's impotent insurrection was a big letdown, I still think there's a lot to learn from it. Because experience is experience whether it is good or bad, you can always take something away from it. So I just want to list a few of what I think are the key points from the day, and I encourage others to add on if you noted anything else.

+ **25,000 men is what it takes to *challenge* the Kremlin within Russia's borders.** I say challenge because we don't know exactly how that would ultimately play out, but given how they were willing to destroy roadways and oil depots it would seem it's enough to scare the people in charge.

+ **Many Russians, including soldiers will do nothing to stop an uprising and may in fact join it.** Wagner faced minimal resistance in their march on Moscow and were able to take over several cities and towns without firing a shot. I saw some reports saying some of the Russian army even joined the Wagner's ranks during the march, but I don't know if those reports were accurate. But it seemed that only near Moscow was there any real attempt to stop the procession.

+ **Aside from a phone call from Lukashenko, Putin will receive no help from his allies.** Iran and Kazakhstan's leadership both stood by and watched as they deemed this an ""internal matter"" for Russia. Nobody else was going to attempt to lend any real physical support to Putin, the most he can hope for is his lapdog Lukashenko attempting to broker a peace.

+ **Putin will seemingly flee at the first signs of any conflict within his borders.** This one is still unverified, but it seems very likely that Putin was on that flight that left Moscow as the Wagner soldiers were approaching. So in the future if a coup were to happen having anti-air near the Kremlin would be a wise idea. And we also likely know where he will head to. We can also assume that even Putin doesn't think his defenses around Moscow are enough to withstand such an assault.

+ **Currently there are several roads and an oil depot that are damaged/destroyed.** Good to know for future potential attacks on the interior and for the current war in Ukraine. Because now we know which roads are no longer operational for the movement of Russia. Troops and equipment to Ukraine, plus the Ukrainians won't waste resources on hitting an oil depot that's already destroyed.

+ **Even when the veil of propaganda is removed and the war comes home to Russia the populace remains ignorant to the reality of this war.** Russian citizens really don't care about what is happening. They're just going to keep their head down and let their masters do whatever they want and just go with it. They won't oppose a rebellion, but they won't be motivated to assist in one either, even if they are shown that they've been lied to and used by the current regime. We can't expect them to rise up on their own (although the soldiers may be a different matter).

+ **Kadyrov and his men are completely useless.** This probably isn't a groundbreaking discovery, but even in a situation where one would assume the Russian leadership was in dire straits, the Kadyrovites will really not do anything to help. It's hard to tell if they are just that incompetent or if they were biding their time and hoping for a regime change themselves. But we can see that their tough talk definitely doesn't match up to their actions.

+ **Putin can be made to bargain yet, and definitely is not in a strong position within his own country.** The fact Prigozhin and his men have so far gotten off scot free shows that Putin's power within Russia is definitely not absolute. If Prigozhin could challenge him, why not one of the other oligarchs? If I remember correctly there are others that have their own PMCs as well. Heck, even if one could get the national guard or a large contingent of the army to side with them they could also challenge Putin it seems.

+ **If Putin wants reliable defense in a similar future situation his only real solution is to pull troops from Ukraine.** Good to know for Ukraine if you want to find a way to weaken the Russian positions and distract them from the frontlines. Also if you are the one running a future coup you have an idea how long you have before you might run into any real opposition.

+ **Prigozhin is now seemingly out of the picture (perhaps Wagner as well).** Pringles is now in Belarus and we are still waiting to find out for certain what will happen to the Wagner PMC. If it gets incorporated into the military it will likely become an ineffectual mess like the rest of the military, and lack any real strong leadership. If it ends up following Prigozhin to Belarus it could become a problem for Belarus, or perhaps Kyiv if they attempt to attack from there again at some point.

+ **Belarus is primed for a rebellion of its own.** I saw many reports at the time of Ukraine and Belarussian groups calling on the Belarussian citizens to prepare to rise up. It seems Lukashenko may have fled as a result of this, but that's unconfirmed as far as I know. Still, it seems Belarus is just waiting for the shadow of Russia to lift just a little before it descends into its own war against their leadership.",False,1687681274.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,91,0,91,0,0,

If Prigozhin couldn’t win, Putin had no motivation to make a deal that makes him look weak.  We know he has no moral qualms about snuffing out dissidents who have done much less, especially after so publicly calling Prigozhin a traitor.  Even just waiting to do so looks weak based on Putin’s understanding and philosophy of “strength.”  And I know Russia’s military capabilities are weakened, but it simply can’t be possible (or is another massive indictment of their capabilities) that they didn’t have the capability to send in a special ops team or drop some bombs to take out Prigozhin…it’s not like he was well hidden.  That is unless Putin doesn’t have the internal support / strength to stomp him out.

From Prigozhin’s perspective there would be zero case for making a deal if he could win.  And if he couldn’t, why not fight to the end anyway?  He has to know he’s going to be killed…unless, again, he knows Putin no longer has the power to do so.  He can’t be naive enough to rely on a promise of safety in Belarus.

I feel like we will hear some big news in the coming days / weeks but I have zero idea which way it will go.  It could be Putin dies / is deposed through other means, Russia pulls out of Ukraine with some cover story tied to this or something much more dangerous (eg. Putin actually uses the bomb).  I doubt it was, BUT if this was all a psyop / setup done with planning between Putin and Prigozhin there has to be something absolutely massive behind it to justify how bad everyone looks today, and if it wasn’t this definitely still isn’t the end of the story.",1687676740.0,1687676430.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

If there is any truth to the scenario that Prigozhin miscalculated the number of people going turncoat and decided to abandon it, then it is amazing that Putin and the Kremlin was in as much panic as it was. Because they apparently have so little trust in anyone that they flee when an uncertain situation arises.

It seems to me, this might increase the likelihood someone else or some other group might get a similar idea somewhere in an uncertain future. Because if it takes this little to make Putin tremble, imagine when someone does manage to get key people in the army on his side. It is also interesting that Putin has not given a ""everything is fine, all good you can sleep now"" nation speech. When he was in fact very panicky in his first mutiny speech.

For Prigozhin to succeed he needed a portion of the state machinery to support him in order for him to rule and it is clear that did not happen for him. Especially he needed the state police on his side for him to have any hope of successfully squashing the civil unrest that will follow and also to hunt down the current leader of russia who will be working form remote location and organizing a counter. He also needed a significant portion of politicians to support him like governors, parliamentarians etc. he failed woefully to secure their support. so he had no chance but to back down. he might have taken Moscow for a day but will have been ultimately eliminated quickly after. so Prigozhin's ultimate calculation was correct and he was forced to back down and get a compromise. 

For Putin now you might ask, why then did he not ultimately crush Prigozhin when most of the state machinery was still with him? because ultimately he was going to lose Moscow even for a short period of time due to to the strategic failure in organizing a defense of Moscow to Prigozhin's military attack. And loosing Moscow is such a big symbolic loss that he will never recover from it even if he manages to neutralize Prigozhin in a few days time. Putin's lose of power will be permanent if he loses Moscow even for a day. This is the reason Putin was also forced to back down and make a compromise.

""ENGLISH:  
Brief technical conclusions in the wake of Prigozhin's rebellion  
The townsfolk are loyal to Putin only as long as there are no other options. People are drawn to power, to someone who can show it. Look at the reaction of people in Rostov-on-Don, for example.  
Putin and other “powerful people”, “arbiters of the fate of the world”, under the mere assumption that the “musicians” will enter Moscow, ran to draw brown lines that cannot be stepped on. Imagine what would happen if at that moment the Moscow liberation movement emerged from the underground with at least a thousand fighters.  
Before it was clear, but now it is obvious - Putin's punitive bodies are not able to oppose anything to a real armed uprising. They are only capable of repressing obviously unarmed people - the peaceful opposition. You can break into them at six in the morning and arrange a search, because there is no risk of getting shot or running into IEDs. At the sight of really ready to fight and organized people, Putin's trash begin to draw brown lines and surrender without a fight.  
Local liberation movements, stop sleeping. Stop drawing maps, create uprising structures and seize power by force on your territory, recruit fighters into territorial battalions as part of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, develop political representation abroad and at home. The one in power will not be the one who drew a better map and more dramatically depicted the genocide of his people, but the one who can take and hold power.  
Leaders of movements and commanders of partisan cells, stop reading Che Guevara and Marigella, carefully study the actions of the ""musicians"" in the cities and on the road. Useful in your (our) uprising.""

It was very interesting to note that the common theme was that Prigozin had overplayed his hand and restructuring of his role was going to happen soon (many various possibilities were entertained, but what actually happened).

Eg. War on the rocks Michael Koffman laid out his observation that Prigozin is locked in a death spiral and his troubles ""would not possibly happen to a better person"".

My personal summation from these talks is when laid in the historical context of Prigozin, that this man was unique in Russian arsenal, an Elon Musk of criminal world if you will. He had a lot of ""tactical"" eye like his legal counterpart, but complete inability to execute on Strategical overarching layer. His products are for example the highly detrimental Troll Farms and more recently the use of societal waste for ""good"" purposes. That is grinding the Bakhmut with ruthless waves of convicts.

Putin did lose a lot the way this evolved and i doubt Prigo will live happily ever after. Potatoes can sometimes form toxic compounds naturally in Belarus. The way Putin lost this asset possibly wipes all the assets this ""inventor"" had under his sleeve, which will be assimilated to the ineffective ranks of MOD. Wagners unique command structure and methods might've been the pinnacle of Russian land conquering warfare, now lost with the leader.

With him goes the Putins ability to gain access to vast underworld networks, possibly global ones too.

prigozhin’s “Rostov transit”, the main points in brief:

1. prigozhin’s “rebellion” is the first stage of dismantling the putin system.
2. prigozhin is only part of the group and part of the plan, the tip of the iceberg of the destabilization process. 
3. In russia, a group of dissatisfied people has formed – security forces, officials and oligarchic capital, who consider putin’s actions to be deadly for their own interests and existence, a threat to russia.
4. The prigozhin Rostov march is a demonstration how serious are intentions, what opportunities exist, and the creation of conditions for the beginning of the process of power transit, either voluntary or forced. Columns of Wagnerites or other structures may eventually reach the “red square”.
5. putin has only one way to save himself: a total purge of the power bloc, the physical elimination of the Wagner PMC, demonstrative punishment of prigozhin, the introduction of martial law in the country and the deployment of mass repression. It is a big question whether the zolotov-bortnikov punitive machine, focused on beating hipsters, women and teenagers, is able to fulfill these functions.
6. The real russian group for future negotiators with Ukraine already exists, but remains in the shadows, however, lukashenko’s participation in this process is not excluded. 
7.  The putin regime has been stabbed in the back, if not instantly deadly blow, but certainly inevitable, albeit delayed in time.

P.S.
But... everything that can go wrong in russia will go wrong, and the “prigozhin incident” can launch/has launched processes with unpredictable consequences. The countdown has begun. 

P.S.S.
We have to do our own thing... up to the 1991 borders.

(I am not sure this is in fact possible - the military community drastically overestimates the economy's potential and people's enthusiasm).  
>  
>\- So what happened?  
>  
>Putin reacted taking a clear position against the plotters. My theory is that he is in the information bubble - and the problem is that he doesn't listen, even if given proper information. He considers himself and his war far more popular than it actually is. That's what ""degenerate autocracy"" theory is all about.

>\- Who at the top is involved?

>As always, impossible to say, because any support in such cases is conditional. Everyone wants to support the winner, not the loser. The pause between Putin's speech and others' pronouncement of loyalty was remarkably long.

Yesterday we saw almost an agony, but it went through a stage of brief clinical death, after which the dying regime did wake up and returned to its former ""vegetable"" existence.

It seems Prigozhin was quite lucky he did not make it to Moscow on time because he would have captured it for sure. All those pompous roadblocks and checkpoints, hastily built on his way, turned out to be a problem only for civilians who got stuck on the roads; not only did they not stop the Wagner convoys, but Wagner did not even notice them.

In general, if Prigozhin had reached Moscow, he would have taken it, after which the situation would have been completely different - what do and why he needs it at all. At the same time, not the entire Wagner PMC went to Moscow, but about 4-5 thousand people. The Russian army, which a year ago was second best in the world, quickly became the second best army in Ukraine, and now it has also won an honorable second place in the Russian Federation, forfeiting the first place in points to the Wagner Group.

I am surprised that Prigozhin was not awarded a second Hero's Star by Putin's decree yesterday - that would have been the logical conclusion of all the events. No one has ever managed to go from patriot to terrorist and back to patriot so quickly in one day.

In general, the agony of the regime goes quite in line with the plot, there are no particular deviations. The regime is incapable of anything, not even facing terror. As soon as it faces real terrorists skilled in violence, it immediately falls apart and scatters. It only has the capacity and ability to deal with the unarmed and defenseless.

There is no 4D chess. There are no elaborate “master plans” with 20 steps and phases. 

It’s just a bunch of avaricious, greedy, sleep deprived, often emotional morons bumbling around literally flying by the seat of their pants.

Most generals in the Russian military are there because they are dumb and lack ambition so they are no threat to Putin and he likes it that way, and most of the oligarchs literally came from jail and the harsh streets of Soviet Russia before the fall of the USSR and chance and luck basically thrust them into where they are now. All they know is greed and avarice. 

Putin was poor and almost became a taxi driver before a friend with connections brought him into local politics and led him on the path to where he is today.

Prigozhin of course everyone knows by now started his colorful “career” working at a literal hot dog stand in an open air market and prior to that had spent 9 years in prison for burglary.

Abramovich also grew up orphaned and completely impoverished. 

These are people who only know one thing - greed, and they live day by day making short term emotional decisions on how they can grow their wealth even by 0.1%. None of them have many true ideological beliefs if at all except the power and influence that money can buy. None of them trust anyone else and they spend their days consumed with the thought of growing their wealth that as children they never dreamed they would ever have, and also terrified at the thought at ever losing it.",False,1687742178.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

The other side was, if Putin wanted or could get rid of Prigozhin, he would have already done so before all of this blew up to the way it did, and Prigozhin isn't stupid, he would have to have assurances that Putin will do what's agreed before he turned his troop around.

It would answer a lot of questions we had without getting into the 5d chess conspiracies.

So, I found some recent interviews of Prigozhin that I think help clarify a lot of what went down here. I don't think this was an attempt at a coup so much as basically a big protest. He is apparently sick of the war and expects to lose Crimea, and eventually Russia itself if things don't change, and says (rightly so) that the reasons for the war were fabricated, corrupt, and only meant to benefit a few.

Here is a ChatGPT translation and summary of the above article:

> Title: Key Points from the Website Content: ""Prigožin Reveals the Truth About the Start of the Conflict in Ukraine""
> 
> - Jevgenij Prigožin, owner of Wagner Group, states that the goal of Russian aggression in Ukraine was not the denazification of Ukraine or the annexation of occupied territories to bring back Russians, but rather for the profit of oligarchs, state-connected officials, separatist militia generals, and FSB secret services.
> - The ambitions of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu played a significant role in the conflict, according to Prigožin.
> - The Russian Ministry of Defense is attempting to deceive the public and the president by fabricating a story of ""crazy aggression"" from the Ukrainian side.
> - Prigožin points out that there was no imminent threat of aggression from the Ukrainian side, highlighting that there were ongoing sporadic exchanges of fire between different factions along the Donbas region for eight years prior to the conflict.
> - The war was driven by the desire of certain individuals within the Russian military command to showcase their success and for Shoygu to become a marshal.
> - Prigožin accuses Shoygu of incompetence and reveals his personal ambitions to be recognized as a great Tuvinian military leader, a double hero, and a marshal in times of peace.
> - The war was not aimed at bringing Russian citizens back to Russia or demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, but to elevate one individual, described as mentally ill, with the star of heroism.
> - Prigožin accuses Shoygu, comparing him to an ultranationalist, and emphasizes the influence of Russian President Putin.
> - Oligarchs played a crucial role in the war, exploiting the situation for personal gain. They plundered Donbas and used it as a place for embezzlement and enrichment.
> - Prigožin reveals that the war was also intended to install Viktor Medvedchuk as the president of Ukraine to gain control over assets.
> - The war had additional objectives, such as punishing the Zelensky regime and the United States for their alleged involvement in the 2014 coup.
> - Medvedchuk's arrest and subsequent exchange with the Azov regiment highlight his significance and the value placed on him by Russia, despite claiming to denazify Ukraine.
> - The aim was not to incorporate the occupied territories into the Russian Federation but to gain immediate benefits by looting and dismantling Ukrainian industries.
> - Prigožin suggests that the elite's motivation lies in preserving their own lives as long as possible, with access to specialized clinics and equipment.
> 
> Key Takeaway: The website content presents Jevgenij Prigožin's perspective on the motives behind the conflict in Ukraine, suggesting that the Russian aggression was driven by the profit-seeking interests of oligarchs, state-connected officials, and military figures. The narrative challenges the official Russian narrative and highlights the personal ambitions of Defense Minister Shoygu. It also implies that the war was not primarily aimed at bringing back Russians or denazifying Ukraine but rather for personal and strategic gains.

Next, check out these two interviews with him (subtitles provided):

https://nitter.poast.org/DevanaUkraine/status/1671963740198039552 (June 21 interview)

- In this one, he talks mostly about how poorly the war is going and how ammunition, supplies and manpower aren't adequate, and says that one day Russia will wake up and find Crimea taken from them. 

- He also says these figures are hidden from the public (and from Putin, he says). ""It's a rigged fact-checking system to deliver beautiful reports to Moscow"". He says if this continues, it will be the end of Russia. He then mocks the military parades, including a naval parade, and sarcastically says that to have a naval parade, they'd need to pull the Moskava from the bottom of the sea. ""Which you shamelessly sunk, you bastards, along with Russian sailors.""

- He then says that the cost of this special operation is the complete destruction of the Russian army, ""for some schnoodle (Shoigu) to get a marshal's star... so he can paint himself and all the crooks on the murals in the Ministry of Defense temple"". He then reinforces the fact that these losses are being hid from the public and that he believes it will lead to the loss of the Russian army and Russia itself.

In this video, he talks about how from 2014 to 2022, the Donbas region was plundered by oligarchs, and money being stolen from those living in the LPR and DPR.

He says that there was supposed to be an army corps in the LPR and DPR to defend against Ukrainian attack, but it was a farce, and most of the alleged forces didn't exist in reality. ""With a salary of $40k, $20 would be given to the soldier who signed the contract, there was no training, while the generals were simply getting money for these dead souls and the budgets were stolen."" He then goes on to say that the reasons for the Feb 24 invasion were fabricated by the Ministry of Defense (it's implied his hated Shoigu is responsible). 

I'm going to stop summarizing, because I think the gist is clear by now, but here is the rest of the translated interview in chunks, and I'll just copy/paste the WarTranslated summaries:

>In continuation of his interview, Prigozhin lists two reasons for the start of the SMO: a) personal ambitions of Shoygu and b) the desire of Russia's ruling clan, who were not satisfied with the Donbas, to appoint Medvedchuk as the president of Ukraine and divide its assets between each other for plundering. According to Prigozhin, denazification and demilitarisation make no sense since Azov wouldn't be exchanged for Medvedchuk otherwise.

https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672193945604947968#m

>Prigozhin says that by the time Wagner arrived in Ukraine in March of 2022, it was already impossible to be talking about any victory as the forces were simply not enough, but the military leadership was demanding advances, even of 50-100 meters per day, and the dead were not counted.

https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672203268796055554#m

>Prigozhin says again that Rusian lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are falling, and it is only a matter of time until moves similar to Kherson and Kharkiv regroupings take place. Local Russian commanders are forced to provide false reports on their positions so as to not antagonise the high command.

Note that the above interview was only two days ago.

So, after reading all this - I don't get the feeling that he ever intended to actually stage a literal coup. It sounds like he's fed up with the corruption that he says has led to a war that Russia will not win, and could lead to the destruction of Russia itself. He actually comes across as patriotic, and blames not Putin but the ministers and oligarchs that he feels are responsible for all of this.

I think that helps all of this make a lot more sense... he staged what was effectively a massive protest, and then rage-quit. It's also possible that due to his anger and frustration at all of this, he didn't really plan out a real outcome here, about how this would come to an end - just that he felt he needed to make himself heard on these issues and be taken seriously.",1687702922.0,1687702521.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

There are no people abroad -or not killed- that could stage a similar event, and I believe this extreme luck of Germany was a one-time thing.

Russian people have an apathy towards any dread situation, so they want to make it sure that they have a better alternative (as a leader) before taking any risks.

It is obvious this leader was never going to be Prigozhin, and he was not helped by outside forces since he is a war criminal. The only possibility is future infighting over the long term.

Mainly the prediction that Prigozhin is going to be killed in the coming days. This is a man who, for all his villainy, has played his political cards from win to win, who managed to leverage himself into a unique position where Russia needed him and his PMC, allowing him to say and do things that would get others killed or imprisoned. The march to Moscow looked like a very well planned and timed event, and Prigozhin was making all the right moves, arguably ending the situation with a near checkmate over Putin. Of all the terrible things we can say about him, being one of the dumbest morons in Eurasia is not one of them. It is such a fantastical leap of tinfoil faith to think that Prigozhin is so arrogant or stupid to take a deal in which he sells out and ""hopes"" they don't come after him. 

I get that people want to fill the void of information that exists right now, fill it with anything. I think it is testament to just how big that void is right now, and how unexpected everything is, that such wild theories emerge. Let's just take stock of what we don't know:

Firstly, to my knowledge, we still have not seen or heard Putin, Shoigu, Patrushev, or Mishustin since Putin's speech on Saturday morning. I've seen people pointing out that neither has Prigozhin been seen since leaving Rostov. 

Secondly, we still don't know anything about the terms and conditions of the deal - everything is speculation, and there isn't even many clues or indirect events that give us any idea. We've had claims that Shoigu and Gerasimov are out, but no hard facts or evidence to support it. Many claims about the fate of Wagner - a lot of which seem to come from Russian state media itself. Until we know more about the deal, or start to see the effects enough to deduce what it included, it is absolutely futile and nonsensical to make any claims about Prigozhin's foolishness or idiocy. For all we know, he may now be the de facto leader of the war in Ukraine. 

What we can be quite sure of, I think, is that Prigozhin didn't just do this for a paycheck and a mansion in Belarus. He'd have to be far stupider than the person who comes up with such an explanation. 

Here's a suggestion to some of you: try to feel comfortable with not knowing what's going on, and not needing to desperately grasp at all-econompassing theories when there is an information void. Of course, I'm not talking about jokes or irony, or noncredible shitposting, which I enjoy as much as anyone else.

He appealed to warhawks and people tired of the war by saying the war was fraudulent while at the same time saying the ""real war"" would start. He tried to paralyze Putin by openly not going after him.

These strategies I think, did had limited success. Almost no one opposed Wagner and Putin seems to indeed have been paralyzed until hours latter into not acting. But I also think he provided no incentive into joining him. Why would the army tired of the war join him if he says the war will be more brutal and only gived a hint about ending it? Why would officers defect when he says Putin is still going to be top boss and he can take reprisals against them?

Hindsight is 20/20 but my uninformed armchair general mind thinks his better chance was to promise peace and then make the entire invasion army mutiny and march into the Kremlin with 100ks troops.

A lot of analysts think that Putin can't withdraw from Ukraine or he will lose face or lose power or something. I disagree. I strongly believe that Putin can easily withdraw from Ukraine at any time without much political penalty at home. His spin doctors can convince the population that the SMO is over because it has reached its main objectives in destroying the Azov battalion or has sufficiently denazified Ukraine. The populace will be relieved that the war is over, there's less of a threat that either them or a man they love will be drafted. The soldiers at the front will be glad to go home.

Putin will never withdraw from Ukraine unless his military is outright defeated. To Putin and some policymakers at the Kremlin, the idea of an independent Ukraine is anathema. In their mind, all Eastern Slavs must stick together to achieve greatness. They must never turn their eyes westward. To do so would be to betray the Slavic race. 

Putin will never end the war in Ukraine. It is why his military conducts regular missile strikes against civilian, not military targets - every wayward Ukrainian his country kills is one less person to beat down and convert to a Russian later. It's why his country kidnaps Ukrainian children to re-educate them in the Russian way. It's why there is so much focus on Russification. It is why Russia has pushed Belarus towards integration with the Union State, to subsume it as another bunch of oblasts of Russia.

Russian nationalism is inherently genocidal and will never recognize Belarus and Ukraine as truly independent nations - they are Eastern Slavs and must be united as one people to achieve greatness against the West.",False,1687746198.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

I think the concession he got from Putin was that Putin would not run in the 2024 election and would throw his weight behind Prigozhin.

Look at what happened before this:

* Russia is involved in a war it cannot win, but one Putin cannot loose;

* Prigozhin disavowed the war on friday and claimed it was all based on lies by the MoD;

* Prigozhin has been building his credentials by being on the frontlines with his troops and seeing the actual state of affairs, as opposed to the chicken hawks in Moscow;

* Prigozhin has been public feuding with the MoD about the course of the war, setting the stage for the removal of Shoigu and Gerasimov;

* Prigozhin's mad dash to Moscow proved to the Russians, and the world, that Putin had lost control of the situation;

* Prigozhin's mad dash to Moscow also proved that he was the new strongmen which could take control of Russia;

* Prigozhin very abruptly called the whole thing of when he was within sight of Moscow and seems very happy about it;

* Under the Russian constitution a president can only serve 2 terms, and 2024 would be the end of Putin's 4th term. In 2020 a constitutional amendment was passed which would allow Putin to run for an aditional 2 terms.

I think this is how it is going to play out:

* Prigozhin will go to Belarus to get a crash course in statemanship by Lukashenko, who -lets not forget- is still around after 30 years. He will probably also help get the Belarusian military into shape, which will expand his powerbase.

* Shoigu and Gerasimov will be sacked and replaced with Prigozhin loyalist. Prigozhin gains control over the MoD which offers the guarantees he'll need for the 2024 election. 

* Putin will announce that he will not seek reelection after his 2nd term in accordance with the constitution. Putin will retire from public life, but will be given the same guarantees that Yeltsin was given and be allowed to keep all his wealth.

* Prigozhin will run on a peace platform, probably sacrificing Donetsk and Luhansk, but he will try to keep Crimea.

* After winning Prigozhin will ""find"" all the evidence he needs to prove that Shoigu and Gerasimov (and whoever else Prigozhin needs to get rid of) lied to Putin about Ukraine and were behind the whole thing. Thus turning the war into their defeat and preserving Putin's legacy.

And so everybody is happy. Russia gets its way out of the war, Putin's legacy is preserved and Prigozhin gets to be the new boss.

Much of what is known is either bits from social medial/telegram, or statements clearly intended to shape perception from either the Kremlin, Wagner or a cacophony of supposed sources. Unless I have it wrong, we only have the Kremlin's account of what terms were accepted by both sides. We'd be fools to believe either of them.

There were clearly Wagner troops, including some armour, in Rostov, and a number of military facilities overrun. Russian aircraft were actually shot down. Prigrozhin was physically at the ministry building in Rostov and met with senior military officials. But was there really a threat on Moscow?  Were traffic jams on Google maps actually armoured convoys? Were bridges actually blown up? If so, why did Wagner back down? Are his 1000s of troops actually going to accept the coming purge while he scuttle off to Belarus - at least according to the Kremlin's plan? There is clearly much more to the picture of what happened yesterday, and it will be a while before we find out. My own view is that the official narrative doesn't add up - I would guess that the run on Moscow was a diversion, and successful or not Wagner's real goal was to seize tactical warheads or other WMDs as a last ditch effort to remain untouchable. Did they succeed? It seems odd to me they were trundle back to the same Luhansk base that was supposedly hit two days ago.

In any case, nothing will be the same. It certainly was not a good moment for Putin in that the visage of competence, control and loyalty is clearly irreversibly damaged. He was already struggling to keep this stable. Whatever happened, the military was clearly caught between disbelief and disorganization, and gave the impression that anyone could run on Moscow. But as with other developments in this war, that doesn't mean Putin's power is loosened. It just means the pretense of democracy won't continue, and he will only have fear to keep control moving forwards. There will be a night of the long knives and demonstration of teeth or he will lose his power.

733d1223fcb7dedc3839f56eb4aa6cf4,14icclh,jphwxez,"I have a theory of the circus that we have observed for the past few days.

Wagner leader Prigozhin has become increasingly frustrated with the Russian MOD and leadership and the Russian leadership has become increasingly frustrated with Prigozhin. Given this situation, there have for a while been signals that Wagner would become outlawed and possibly dismantled and absorbed by the Russian armed forces. Seeing the inevitable doom of the Russia/Wagner relationship, Prigozhin started a plan to exit the Russian commitment in Ukraine and at the same time do as much damage as possible to the current Russian regime.

Meanwhile in Belarus, president Lukashenko has been facing increased internal tensions and diminishing support due to the war in Ukraine and the pressure from the Russian regime. A few years ago, Russia thwarted a would-be coup/assassination of Lukashenko and with that effectively bought his unbound loyalty. Feeling trapped by Russia and having increased tensions due to refusing to participate directly in the Ukraine war, Lukashenko has been looking for a way out from the Russian leash and a need to secure his power internally.

A few months ago a golden ticket was provided to Lukashenko; Russian nuclear weapons were to be transferred into and placed within Belarus. My theory is this;

What if Prigozhin and Lukashenko has made a deal to both cut the leash from Russia while at the same time gaining full autonomy and power in the region? By staging a coup against the Russian government, Prigozhin would effectively cause a massive distraction, chaos and uproar within the russian military and leadership while at the same time causing distrust and division within the Russian population. Lukashenko then negotiates a «deal» on «behalf» of Putin to stop the coup while securing Wagner loyalty to Belarus.

With Prigozhin safe in Belarus and all eyes in Russia facing towards Moscow, Wagner is now free to move to Belarus and act as the private security for Lukashenko. Now Lukashenko has a private army and nuclear weapons which in turn gives an opportunity to cut ties with Russia and emerge as a autonomous nuclear power while at the same time further securing his power internally, while at the same time emerging as a strong leader and hero for single handedly saving Russia from a coup.

Another weird thing I noticed is that Prigozhin didn't blame Putin directly, just Shoigu and Gerasimov. Why would he do this if he was doing a coup and why does he care so much about Shoigu and Gerasimov and not Putin himself? There could only be one reason. Prigozhin wanted to use Putin as a scapegoat when russia gets defeated and he tried to take control of the ministry of defense and thus the russian army. And here's the bat shit crazy part:  My theory is that he succeeded but silently. Now putin is a figurehead controlled by Prigozhin and the replacements for Shoigu and Gerasimov might be allies of Prigozhin.

Prigozhin doesn't want to publically become the russian leader just yet. He's waiting for the end of the war to blame the russian defeat on putin and then he will come to ""save"" russian people from the corruption of the putin regime. This is why he seemingly accepted such a bad deal. If he took Moscow by force and ended the war himself he would lose the approval of russians.   Now the even crazier part: Depending on the way he sees the situation he might realise that russia can't win the war and either get NATO involved to blame the failure on NATO or sabotage the russian army to blame the failure on Putin. However, he might still make a last attempt at making some progress in the war by organizing a coup in Belarus, installing a figurehead in Lukashenko's place and using the belarusian army to attack Ukraine from the north (not very likely to work). This is the potential link between the coup and Belarus (and why he went there after it) and Lukashenko.

to accomplish this, i suspect putin had encouraged the spat between prigozhin and shoigu the past little while (notice putins lack of intervention the entire time his two mininions were fighting each other pubicly), and goaded prigozhin to make a big show of his resolve against shoigu, like marching to moscow under the banner of pushing out shoigu, telling prigozhin that doing so can give him (putin) the excuse needed to fire shoigu and providing prigozhin with reassurances that he wont be punished. then as soon as prigozhin actually started marching towards moscow, putin then publicly branded him a traitor and signed his arrest warrant (the one and only time he intervened in the spat between prigozhin and shoigu), likely catching prigozhin by surprise who thought his boss only wanted to use this advance as a talking point to fire shoigu, rather than using it against him instead. 

suddenly putin had the both the pretense and legitimacy (in the eyes of the average brainwashed russians who has been seeing wagner as a successful fighting force for russia in the war) to fold in wagner without triggering any backlash from either prigozhin or the public. 

this would explain why there was only token fight between wagner and russia (and theres a video of prigozhin chatting and laughing with some bosses at the rostov military base yesterday). any real fighting wouldve made it politically impossible for putin to pardon prigozhin. it would also explain why they just stopped marching once they were inly few hundred km from moscow. it would also explain why prigozhin, a random money drive oligarch and a putin lackey who owes everything to putin, would feel like he could so publicly trash talk the russian defense minister.",1687669924.0,1687669538.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

So it goes like this. Prigozhin had ideas about marching on Moscow but in order to be successful he needed to know he had enough support in the military that would switch to his side when he got to/was on his way to Moscow. Only way to know that is to ask them, so when he started putting the feelers out obviously some/most of those not with him reported him, so the MOD knew what he was up to.

So, the MOD just told its officers to say they would join him (even though they wouldn't), and that's how you end up with prigozhin 100 miles outside Moscow with his dick in his hand and a few thousand men wanting to take a city of 20 million people wondering why noone else showed up.

My guess is Shoigu and Gerasimov got Prigozhin to unknowingly play an extremely weak hand and let him make it all the way to Moscow just to make him look maximally foolish (especially in the eyes of putin).

He's watched his people getting pushed about by the Russian government for months, losing his fighters whilst being stood up by the Russian Army and it's easy to understand why he's had enough.

I think the whole push for Moscow might have been a way of distracting MOD. I mean, his first target was Rostov. The way Russian command doctrine works, that hub was the nerve center for most of the military in the area (Southern Military District) it's also the nerve center for Iskander StS missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. 

I could see Ramzan Kadyrov being behind this whole mess, because he was the guy sent to ""put down"" the mutiny. 

Priggy heads for Moscow, after having already taken the blame for removing the hq from the communication channels and presumably oversight. Then he slowly ""surrenders"" the facility to the Chechens, who are using it as cover to snag launch codes and top secret info on the nukes. Meanwhile, any western analyst with eyes on the inside will have had his sources go to ground at the first wind of a coup so as not to arouse suspicion. This has the unintended consequence of hampering if not shutting off NATO Intel of the situation on the ground. 

Priggy tells Russian MOD when the job is done what exactly has happened, and now he has insurance, hence his easy retirement deal. 

He convienently moves to Belarus, a country famous for recently coming into possession of Russian Tac nukes WITHOUT the mechanisms to use them. Until now. 

Luka has a bargaining chip on Russia. And meanwhile, the Chechens sell the nuclear secrets to Iran. And maybe hold onto a few in exchange for coming independence.",1687737695.0,1687736711.0,t3_14icclh,t3_14icclh,,0,-37,0,-37,0,0,

A lot of people just like to scream “propaganda” or “false flag” whenever they don’t understand a situation but there are generally some specific characteristics to look for whenever an actual false flag attacks.

False flags are NOT designed to make the side doing them look weak. They are designed to cause outrage but also reflect strength for the side planning them. The media element is also crucially important so in a false flag operation we typically see a bunch of well prepared statements and clear communication from the side doing it.

An army marching on Moscow virtually unopposed and the potential collapse of the Russian logistics hubs near Ukraine made it legitimately look like Putin and his followers were about to die. It made them look weak and ending in negotiations also made it seem like he couldn’t effectively wield power. There was also a long lag before Putin went on TV and the media was caught totally unprepared by it. Also even now Russia isn’t really coming out and blaming anyone for it in mass. If I was an outraged Russian civilian just WHO would I be outraged against?

In my mind I think luka was being the smart man many have claimed before. Probably talking for very long to a ferocious pringles who started his dash half planned, half triggered by mod events the day(s) before. While Rostok on Don was taken without much force, it may have been the shock and awe rather then real power. Driving north the group did not grow as intended and pringles may have been hit by the reality how things were to play out (luka may have been drawing that picture in the conversations).

So basically many things that happened yesterday are to be taken on face value. Put and pringles both lost, but pringles lost way more (short term…). The brokered deal means wagner is gone… and on that deal, I expect pringles to have been deceived with the mod leadership change promises.

he got himself and his men(Wagner) out of the shitshow that is Ukraine before a major Ukranian Counter-Offensive started where Pregozhin would've lost a lot of manpower and he won't face any blowback for it and rumors now but possibly retired Sergei Shoigu which is a big big achievement, Shoigu has been in politics since Soviet Union and has survived every purge, political instability, political games and so on

Prigozhin had beef with Russian Ministry of Defence and Retired him, Job done, so no need to go further, Prigozhin didn't want to take over the whole country

Weakness because their entire army is on the frontline and they are very vulnerable.
 
Power because an army of 25,000, with no military resistance at all, was not able to end him. Somehow, he had other means to defend his regime.

And in my opinion, chances that there will be anything else, another coup pr rebellion are basically non-existent.

We don’t know what they told Pringles, but it ended any chances of a military or palace coup.

Maybe this was the goal all along, to simulate a coup with an enormous army and make it fail? So someone who assembled a 500 man force would not even think about it. But idk.

I think it shows how overextended his troops are in Ukraine. Theoretically there should have been a lot of troops in  on the border with Kharkiv since there's been a lot of cross border movement by insurgents. The fact that they had nothing to redeploy to Moscow either means the military brass weren't confident Putin's regime would survive or there is only a skeleton garrison on the border. In the first case Putin's regime need's to do an immediate purge on the military or else they're dead the second another uprising  starts. In the second the only thing stopping Ukraine from blitzing up to Moscow is the ban on Western supplied weaponry being used on Russian soil. 

>Kadyrov and his men are completely useless.

What we do know for sure is that Prigozhou hates Shoigu (and some others) and blames them for the war in Ukraine. He has spoken about this loudly recently and says they must be removed. Also, Wagner is scheduled to be dissolved, and its troops rolled into the general Russian military (run by the ministry of defense, AKA Shoigu) on the 30th. 

So he rolls up on Moscow, and some sort of deal is negotiated, and he turns around and goes home. But nobody's sure what the deal is.

However, there have been rumors/rumblings today that Shoigu might indeed be replaced soon:

> Despite the deal, neither Shoigu nor Gerasimov have been seen or heard from, and there are rumours Shoigu has been detained or sacked.
> 
> Alexei Dyumin, a former Kremlin bodyguard and the governor of the Tula region, has been touted as a possible replacement for Shoigu.
> 
> Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov was asked whether there would be any changes to Russia’s military leadership.
> 
> He replied: “These matters are the sole prerogative and within the competence of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Putin in accordance with the constitution of the Russian Federation.

Then there's this article from today, which is in Russian. I've translated it with ChatGPT:

>**The State Duma does not see any reason to ban the private military company ""Wagner""**

>18:54, June 25, 2023
Russia


>Chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, stated that he sees no reason to ban the private military company (PMC) ""Wagner"" in Russia. He shared his opinion in an interview with ""Vedomosti.""

>""Why should it be banned? All the questions are directed at the PMC leader. Joseph Vissarionovich [Stalin] said that children are not responsible for their parents. The one who raised the rebellion should be held accountable,"" the deputy expressed his views.
Kartapolov referred to the PMC ""Wagner"" as the most combat-ready unit in the country today. ""To disarm and disband them would be the best gift to NATO and Ukrainians that one can think of. There's no need to do that,"" added the politician.

>On June 23, the founder of ""Wagner,"" Yevgeny Prigozhin, claimed that Russian military forces allegedly struck the rear camps of the group. He threatened to respond with force. Subsequently, the FSB initiated a case against the businessman on charges of organizing an armed rebellion. Later, Wagner fighters appeared in Rostov-on-Don, and a column with their equipment was also spotted on the highway en route to Moscow. In some regions of the country, including the capital, a counter-terrorism operation regime was introduced.

>In the evening of June 24, the press service of the President of Belarus, Lukashenko, announced that Prigozhin had agreed to halt the movement of Wagner columns on Russian territory, which was soon confirmed by Prigozhin himself. After that, the Kremlin announced the imminent lifting of the counter-terrorism operation regime and the cessation of the criminal case against the head of Wagner.

So now we suddenly have the chairman of Parliament speaking out in support of Wagner, and saying it shouldn't be disbanded. Interesting, no? 

I think it's possible Prigozhin might end up getting his way with this after all, at least partly.

Many are making the assumption that Prigozhin 'ran away' or failed somehow. I think this might dispell the assumption that Prigozhin turned and left without getting at least something out of this 'deal'.

We'll see what happens in the coming days. I think that if in a few weeks time, Shoigu is gone and Wagner PMC is still around, the Prigozhin actually got what he wanted.",False,1687731556.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpim6mo,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

1. *So far, there's a lot of talk about having Wagner family members held at ransom to extract this concession*

I believe Prigozhin was a a cornered rat and he and Wagner  were most definitely in the crosshairs so he was dead if he didn't do anything so death off the back of the march wasn't  any worse of a fate. So, being offered asylum in Belarus isn't a terrible  outcome. 


2. *Going to Belarus doesn't make sense long term for Priggy's operations in Africa, for example*.

As above it's Belarus or death unless maybe he moves to Africa at some point. But I dont think Wagner is going  to be around  much longer in it's current  form for much longer. 


3. *The coup failed and Wagner is going to join the MoD soon, but is Priggy going to remain in charge*?

No troops that sign up will report directly to the Russian MOD and Prigozhin will be gone and Wagner will be devolved

According to our activists, yesterday afternoon, one of the groups of PMC Wagner moved in the direction of Borisoglebsk with the purpose to enter the territory of the military camp ""Voronezh-45"", where the military unit 14254 (12th Main Directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry (GUMO)) is located. This facility is where the Russian Defense Ministry's tactical nuclear weapons are stored.

The convoy consisted of 20 lightly armored vehicles, and the total number of Wagnerians was more than 100.

It is still unknown how long they stayed on the territory of the military unit and what the results of their stay were, but it is known for sure that in the evening military aviation destroyed the bridges connecting Voronezh and Borisoglebsk. 

Given that official Moscow is trying to hush up the issue as much as possible, and Prigozhin's riot has suddenly ceased, there are many questions.

Will try to find out as much information as possible from eyewitnesses of the events.

**Here's my analogy for all this that might be a bit of a trite comparison, but can serve as an example behind the seemingly strange or inexplicable events that went down in a way that may make them understandable:**

Imagine that Pirgozhin is a department manager at a corporation, who is upset at the working conditions or thinks the company is going the wrong direction. He thinks the upper management (Shoigu, etc) are running the company into the ground, embezzling from the payroll etc, and aren't listening to him or taking his concerns to the big boss. He is loyal to the CEO, and believes that the problem is solely with that upper management, who are lying to the CEO and covering up the rotten state of the company.

So he gets his department together and says 'come on guys, let's go talk to the big man himself!' They storm down the hall with the intention of bursting into the CEO's office (Putin) and airing everything out. So in that analogy, they weren't going to chuck the CEO out the window or anything (they're still loyal to him), but believed the CEO would hear them out and sympathize with them. They really believed that Putin was being lied to, and that they just needed him to put the corrupt upper management in its place and sort things out. 

In this case, instead of hearing them out, the CEO heard them coming down the hall and took off out the back door. He then sided with the corrupt upper management (Shoigu and the oligarchs), and threw Pirghozhin under the bus. They thought they were going to get his support, but he called them traitors to the company instead.

The department manager (Pirgozhin) was crestfallen by this, and had the wind go out of his sails. He really thought the big boss would listen to him and fix this problem and chuck out the corrupt managers. But their blind loyalty to the CEO meant they never realized that their poor 'company culture' extended to the top, and that he was never going to side with them. 

So, dejectedly, the workers walk away, and the department manager resigns.

I guess if you want to extend this metaphor - another manager from the Belarus field office (Lukashenko) hears about what's going on at HQ, and calls this department manager in order to put a salve on things, and says, 'Hey man, come over and work in the Belarus office for a while with me until this blows over'. He knows this will get him brownie points with the CEO for taking this problem employee off his hands for a while, and will be owed a favor or promotion.

So, that's my latest take on things (subject to change, lol). It at least makes a lot more sense to me thinking about this from this perspective - a disgruntled employee fed up with corrupt and ineffective upper management who still had ultimate faith in the company and CEO. It was never going to be about staging a violent coup and overthrowing the government, it was about organizing his department team members together and charging down the hall to be heard by the CEO, who he thought would sort things out and fix the systemic problems in the company. 

When that didn't happen, the fight went out of him.

Now his department will be dissolved and the workers will be rolled into one of the other corrupt departments.

Edit: I'm reminded of an episode of Mad Men, where Pete finds out that Don Draper isn't who he says he is and has been living under a borrowed identity for years. He tries to make a power play by going to the Big Man (Bert Cooper) with his 'dirt' on Don, thinking Don will be ousted.

Russians were much more desperate for change in 1917. Something closer to democracy was also Russia's first, and likely most popular choice at this time. I fully agree there are no people widely known of today with the same sort of potential as Lenin, and conditions may not yet be right for this person even if they did exist.

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/11/world/europe/zaporizhzhia-kakhovka-dam-water.html

Cooling requirements for post-shutdown reactors are highest just when they are shutdown (and fission product content is highest) and decrease exponentially with time as the fission products decay.

For example, the major reason why Fukushima went so bad was because the Tsunami disabled the cooling hours after the shutdown. If there had been more time (possibly even hours), the decay heat would've been a lot more manageable.

It seems to me that given the time since the shutdown to decay heat to reduce, the effect of blowing up the cooling would be quite limited.

I would've expected the plan to blow up the reactors directly, though even in that scenario I struggle to think where the energy for spreading the radionuclides would come from (in a conventional accident this would be the rising steam/hot air from fires), chances are the effect of that would be quite localized.",False,1687717895.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jphq9dk,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Nikolai Patrushev and Sergei Kiriyenko devised a plan to get rid of Shoigu and Gerasimov.

Do you remember that Shoigu wanted to have Wagner under MoD control?

Unfortunately for Shoigu Mizintsev was assigned from general staff to Wagner as a commander. And Mizintsev is a close friend of Kiriyenko. This whole clusterduck happened because Shoigu wanted to fight for his warm spot in the powercircle and gave Putin false report that Prigozhin is trying to oust Putin. Which was corrected (probably by Kiriyenko) a few hours later. However in the meantime Shoigu sent aviation after Wagner forces. Mizintsev tried to order pilots to stand down, but he is not in their chain of command and they destroyed a few of Wagner vehicles. So Mizintsev ordered to return fire. Shoigu fled in the meantime. As soon as Putin was briefed what's really going on, he took back his morning accusations. However damage has been done, but it was good enough for Kiriyenko and Patrushev and they called Mizintsev off. Maybe Shoigu is a Putin's friend, but it was Kiriyenko that gave him FSB and made him a president. They still need a scapegoat. Most probably Prigozhin will take that role in exchange for something.

And there's obviously the fact that his troops were greeted, welcomed, and fed along the way, and that people were booing the return of the city police when Wagner left.

Thing is, Pirgozhin has been VERY outspoken recently about how he feels this entire war was started on false pretenses, and that reports of losses are doctored before being sent to Putin to make things look better than they are, and that the whole thing is a meatgrinder. He's said that this could all lead to the fall of Russia as a whole. You can hear him say it himself in this video (broken up into parts, subtitles included): 


https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672177488535977984 (June 23 interview)

In this video, he talks about how from 2014 to 2022, the Donbas region was plundered by oligarchs, and money being stolen from those living in the LPR and DPR.

He says that there was supposed to be an army corps in the LPR and DPR to defend against Ukrainian attack, but it was a farce, and most of the alleged forces didn't exist in reality. ""With a salary of $40k, $20 would be given to the soldier who signed the contract, there was no training, while the generals were simply getting money for these dead souls and the budgets were stolen."" He then goes on to say that the reasons for the Feb 24 invasion were fabricated by the Ministry of Defense (it's implied his hated Shoigu is responsible). 

I'm going to stop summarizing, because I think the gist is clear by now, but here is the rest of the translated interview in chunks, and I'll just copy/paste the WarTranslated summaries:

https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672186669762596865#m

>In continuation of his interview, Prigozhin lists two reasons for the start of the SMO: a) personal ambitions of Shoygu and b) the desire of Russia's ruling clan, who were not satisfied with the Donbas, to appoint Medvedchuk as the president of Ukraine and divide its assets between each other for plundering. According to Prigozhin, denazification and demilitarisation make no sense since Azov wouldn't be exchanged for Medvedchuk otherwise.

https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672193945604947968#m

>Prigozhin says that by the time Wagner arrived in Ukraine in March of 2022, it was already impossible to be talking about any victory as the forces were simply not enough, but the military leadership was demanding advances, even of 50-100 meters per day, and the dead were not counted.

https://nitter.poast.org/wartranslated/status/1672203268796055554#m

>Prigozhin says again that Rusian lines in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are falling, and it is only a matter of time until moves similar to Kherson and Kharkiv regroupings take place. Local Russian commanders are forced to provide false reports on their positions so as to not antagonise the high command.

Note that the above interview was only two days ago.

Given that speaking out against the war is basically a crime in Russia (especially enforced in the early days), his forthrightness on this issue is pretty bold, and it's unsurprising that he finds supporters, especially among the military who are experiencing the meatgrinder firsthand. He's saying very loudly what most people are afraid to whisper. 

If he's becoming something of a folk hero among soldiers, then that's a big problem for the Russian administration, which is why I question whether he'll be 'disappeared' like many here are saying. That could turn him into a martyr.

I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of Russians really do want this war over at this point, they're just afraid to say it out loud, and here's a guy who is, and has clout. And note that he's not lying the blame for all of it at the administration itself, but at the head of the ministry of defence, Shoigu, who he blames for starting this war and mismanaging it.

Now, I am in no way defending the man as a person at all, but I think he himself is sick of this war and is doing what he can to clean house in perhaps the only way he can. He does strike me as patriotic, and genuinely pissed at the meatgrinder situation, and probably genuine in his fears that this could lead to the downfall of Russia altogether. 

I've said this in another comment, but I don't think this was an attempted coup in the sense that he was actually intending to overthrow the government or anything. 

I imagined it as something akin to an employee marching down the hall at work to bang on the CEO's door and air out his grievances about the middle manager that's fucking up the company.

One possible reason is that he hadn’t foreseen 3000 Chechens heading to defend Moscow. Apparently, Prigozhin only sent a few thousand soldiers to Moscow. With 3000 Chechens that seem loyal to Putin, he may not have been able to take Moscow as he intended.

Basically the Wagner group is a merc company fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Prigozhin, the leader of Wagner, has been highly critical of other military high command and has claimed that they're just throwing his soldiers at the enemy, not caring about casualties. This all came to a head when Putin announced he would officially fold Wagner into the army (which would mean a huge power loss for Prigozhin) and Russian planes allegedly attacked a Wagner camp. 

Seeing the writing on the wall, Prigozhin made what seems like a desperate play and began marching on Moscow. They marched into and occupied the cities of Rostov and Voronezh with very little resistance. Prigozhin was demanding the removal of 2 Russian generals (Girasimov and Shoigu) and that his troops would be protected. Putin announced he was committing treason and seemingly fled Moscow with other officials.

However, about 200km from Moscow Prigozhin stopped and turned back, announcing the mutiny was over. This came after he and the Belarusian president Lukashenko were able to reach a deal. 1) Prigozhin and the Wagner troops in the mutiny get immunity, he moves to Belarus. 2) the Wagner troops that didn't take part will be folded into the MOD. 3) US intelligence suggests Shoigu will be replaced, although this isn't confirmed.

It ended with both sides looking bad. Putin because this made him look weak, especially since the Wagner chief was pardoned. Prigozhin because Wagner is getting folded into the army anyway, his soldiers are angry at him for agreeing to a deal and he is at an extremely high risk of assassination in the near future.",False,1687690815.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpganhm,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

About a million people are at risk of radiation poisoning in the first few hours of such a disaster and tens of thousands may die of it.

1997e78002003cb15cb2a56d8b74063e,14icclh,jpjtkon,"I see what you’re saying, but note also the following points:

1) the IAEA director general met with Russian officials only two days ago to discuss the situation, they’re aware of the claims by Ukraine, and they have themselves not seen any mines in the cooling plant, only on the outer perimeter around the plant. Of course mines could have been added after their last inspection on June 16, but [they’re well aware of the claims and situation ](https://kyivindependent.com/iaea-no-mines-observed-in-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plants-cooling-pond/) and [Russia explicitly asked the IAEA to ensure the safety at the power plant as recently as Friday ](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-asks-iaea-ensure-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-security-2023-06-23/), which together with the recent inspections makes it very unlikely that there’d be issues due to mismanagement over the last year that we wouldn’t be aware of or that Russia is trying to hide.

2) neither the US nor anyone else from NATO have made any statements on the claims by Ukraine regarding the plans of causing an incident; US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on Friday stated that he was aware of the claims by Ukraine, but had nothing to confirm them or speak to their validity. Given that US secret services were already aware of the Prigozhin coup as early as Wednesday, and given that the ZNPP is the one place within Ukraine where we have independent observers with the IAEA, I would assume that we are very well aware of the situation there.

3) the resolution introduced by Sen. Graham and Blumenthal is not an official statement by the U.S., it’s just a non-binding resolution so far that hasn’t even passed, and given that there’s been no further reaction or comment from the US on the topic this is thus far the reaction of two senators, not official US or NATO 
position - and if the US were aware of an imminent threat, they would have an incentive to publicly give a warning both to the world (as they have done many times before) as well as to Russia.

4) I don’t quite see why Putin not making an appearance since his speech on Saturday indicates a worrying radio silence, and why this would be an indication that he’s planning WW3 because of this - he doesn’t usually make appearances every few days (which made his speech all the more important at the time), but this doesn’t seem like an unusual radio silence yet; they probably have plenty of internal points and struggles right now.

5) I also don’t see why Putin preparing to trigger WW3 is “the ONLY case” where he can justify keeping Wagner - that’s pretty far fetched given that they’ve been a very valuable asset to him and he would prefer to keep them fighting for him; we have no idea about what’s going on behind the scenes, what the true circumstances of what happened this weekend were, etc., so I think you’re jumping to conclusions very quickly here in a situation where there are likely a hundred other things going on.

Would I trust Russia not to cause an incident at ZNPP? Absolutely not, but I also think people have a strong tendency to read into things on here, and the facts that the IAEA seems so closely involved (and Russia is not keeping them out, but rather actively involving them) and that there have been no statements from the US or NATO on this at all other than “we’ve heard the claims, but we’ve seen nothing to confirm them” make me at least a bit less worried right now.",False,1687752465.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpjp0gf,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

I do it by way of using the HarpaAI Chrome plugin (which is ChatGPT powered). It gives you a console you can open, and you can use the '/translate {{page}}' command to get a decent English translation.

Alternatively, for long articles, you can just use the '/summary' command, even on a foreign language page, and it will give you a summary (short or detailed, you can choose either) in English.

And here is the ChatGPT summary, in English, of the above article:

> Title: Key Points from the Website Content: ""Prigožin Reveals the Truth About the Start of the Conflict in Ukraine""
> 
> - Jevgenij Prigožin, owner of Wagner Group, states that the goal of Russian aggression in Ukraine was not the denazification of Ukraine or the annexation of occupied territories to bring back Russians, but rather for the profit of oligarchs, state-connected officials, separatist militia generals, and FSB secret services.
> - The ambitions of Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu played a significant role in the conflict, according to Prigožin.
> - The Russian Ministry of Defense is attempting to deceive the public and the president by fabricating a story of ""crazy aggression"" from the Ukrainian side.
> - Prigožin points out that there was no imminent threat of aggression from the Ukrainian side, highlighting that there were ongoing sporadic exchanges of fire between different factions along the Donbas region for eight years prior to the conflict.
> - The war was driven by the desire of certain individuals within the Russian military command to showcase their success and for Shoygu to become a marshal.
> - Prigožin accuses Shoygu of incompetence and reveals his personal ambitions to be recognized as a great Tuvinian military leader, a double hero, and a marshal in times of peace.
> - The war was not aimed at bringing Russian citizens back to Russia or demilitarizing and denazifying Ukraine, but to elevate one individual, described as mentally ill, with the star of heroism.
> - Prigožin accuses Shoygu, comparing him to an ultranationalist, and emphasizes the influence of Russian President Putin.
> - Oligarchs played a crucial role in the war, exploiting the situation for personal gain. They plundered Donbas and used it as a place for embezzlement and enrichment.
> - Prigožin reveals that the war was also intended to install Viktor Medvedchuk as the president of Ukraine to gain control over assets.
> - The war had additional objectives, such as punishing the Zelensky regime and the United States for their alleged involvement in the 2014 coup.
> - Medvedchuk's arrest and subsequent exchange with the Azov regiment highlight his significance and the value placed on him by Russia, despite claiming to denazify Ukraine.
> - The aim was not to incorporate the occupied territories into the Russian Federation but to gain immediate benefits by looting and dismantling Ukrainian industries.
> - Prigožin suggests that the elite's motivation lies in preserving their own lives as long as possible, with access to specialized clinics and equipment.
> 
> Key Takeaway: The website content presents Jevgenij Prigožin's perspective on the motives behind the conflict in Ukraine, suggesting that the Russian aggression was driven by the profit-seeking interests of oligarchs, state-connected officials, and military figures. The narrative challenges the official Russian narrative and highlights the personal ambitions of Defense Minister Shoygu. It also implies that the war was not primarily aimed at bringing back Russians or denazifying Ukraine but rather for personal and strategic gains.",False,1687732351.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpiovbd,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

In a coup, you have to start with a small circle of support because the wider the conspiracy, the more likely it is to be discovered and countered.  So you have to convince most of the men who are the lynchpins of power to flip at the moment of the coup.

Prigozhin couldn't gain enough military and civilian authorities to switch sides and do so quickly enough,  so he lost. Simple as that.

He likely panicked when Russian artillery targeted Wager bases, in a likely attempt to kill Progozhin.  He had some scheme cooked up, and figured it was now or never.

Without a lot more support, Wagner forces near Moscow were on a death march.  He had to be hoping that he would pick up defectors within Moscow, but once the internet is turned off within the entire Moscow region… there’s no meaningful way for modern society to organize at scale.

This guy, Prigozhin, is the mass murderer responsible for shit like Bucha and all sorts of other places.  

I was hoping for something like a seven day debacle that paralyzed Russian MoD / caused panicked withdrawals of portions of the occupied territories.  A coup d’tat by a warlord, taking over a nuclear arsenal, would be a nightmare.  

The only thing that surprised me was how quickly and shamelessly Prigozhen threw his men under the bus.  Though it should have been obvious it was all a ploy to save his own neck once Russian artillery was trained on his base.  

For Russian propaganda purposes, the “24 hour mutiny where all the men are left hanging” (just like Trump’s half assed plot) will have a chilling effect on other mutiny within Russia.  The fact that Russian elites so quickly roll on the people who risk everything on treason… yeah Russian media will make it very clear to the people how lining up against Putin will not work.  All the Wagner forces that aren’t killed for this will have been pressed into “disciplinary battalions” (which was a WWII tactic for throwing undesirables into a meat grinder).  They call it “signing contracts” but they’re as good as dead.

They are a conglomerate of academic, retired military, retired intelligence—claim to be Russian, Baltic, and Ukrainian conglomerate—channel has predated the war—and write specifically for an academically-minded audience exclusively on Russian military/defense/intelligence.  Basically, a think tank.  But not.

They are known to have extremely well-placed sources in command staff and general staff.  Their sources are in RF’s General Staff, the various RF field HQs, Ukraine’s Stravka, UA’s Southern Command, UA’s Eastern Command, and various levels of NATO.  One of the most impactful things I’ve read in this war was their publication of this questionnaire, 4 commanders, both sides.  The Russians were disillusioned, but one was a true believer. The Ukrainians were full of zeal and committed.  Followed up, 4-5months later with new questionnaire.  Two Russian commanders had died.  but got two new to fill out questionnaire. 3/4 confessed to serious considerations of “switching sides,” one was suicidal.  The Ukrainians fought fatigue and their internal moments of despondency, but were not wavering in their commitments. The Russians were disillusioned, it was extremely illuminating, I’m not doing it justice. 

I myself became aware of them after other think tanks referenced them. Maybe I SW?

Not sure I understand your reasoning here. Self-preservation is the one motivation common to everyone; why wouldn't Prigozhin choose life over immediate death?

But either way, this doesn't speak to the point you're making. You're trying to ask why Putin would **offer** Prigozhin a deal - Prigozhin's own choice to take it is irrelevant to that, as is whether he cares about his troops - all that matters is whether his troops would decide to level Rostov in response to assassination, which would probably collapse the Russian war effort entirely, because that would factor into Putin's decisionmaking.

In shorter terms, think of it this way - though Prigozhin may have missed in his attempt to grab Moscow, he could still hold Rostov hostage, and that would be worth quite a bit to Putin.

> Putin had no motivation per-se, it’s that he only has that motivation if he is extraordinarily weak.

...this might be a ""think about it in the morning"" situation - you've been talking about Prigozhin's motivations, not Putin's.

But part of that aggressive attritional battle occurs when you launch an assault to encourage a response.   Without the provocation, the Russians could theoretically slug it out from fortified positions and turn it into a level battle of artillery tit-for-tat.   What I was suggesting was that these moves across the 2014 lines were intended to be a 'red line' crossing event that would encourage the Russians to immediately bring units and supplies forward to engage the Ukrainians.

While the Ukrainians hunker down to keep the Russians pinned in place and take out vehicles that are trying to push forwards, the artillery can also work on those advancing units and supplies that are out of protection and cover that would have been sitting safely were the conflict stuck in a static state.

* Why did Lukashenko represent Putin's government in negotiation when Lukashenko has slow-walked annexation? The incentives don't align. 
* Why did Prigozhin initially push back on Lukashenko's public assertion before acquiescing a half hour later? 
* Why did Prigozhin unilaterally abandon an advantageous position prior to tangible action by the Kremlin? 
* Why doesn't Prigozhin fear reprisal? 
* Why haven't either Prigozhin, Putin, or Shoigu emerged to answer questions regarding this event? There is a clear first-mover advantage in information warfare. Nobody high up seems keen to take advantage of the vacuum. 
* Banishment to Belarus. Excuse me what the fuck? Is Lukashenko trying to declare independence but wants to maintain security guarantees? Why would he feel comfortable doing that? 
* Why did Lukashenko make a pitstop in Turkey prior to meeting Prigozhin? How does involving Erdogan benefit Lukashenko? 
* Why did Wagner forces arrive in Rostoc in small groups if this was a well-planned and (heh) orchestrated coup attempt? Either Prigozhin convinced substantial portions of the Russian military proper to join him, or this coup was an impulsive reaction. Personally I lean towards the former given the United States' intelligence disclosures. 
* Civilians in Rostoc greeted Wagner with open arms. Civilians in Rostoc greeted state officials with hostility. Does this mean Prigozhin had substantial public support? 
* Why did Putin brand Prigozhin a traitor on live television, send Lukashenko to negotiate in order to 'limit his involvement', then perform a complete about-face less than twelve hours after his initial broadcast? How do public condemnations of treason limit Putin's involvement?  
* Why do the terms of the deal keep changing? 
* Why are portions of Wagner feeling betrayed if this was 'all part of the plan'? Why have an even greater portion of the group maintained silence?

But let us say it is brief, if the wind is blowing east then it will go over eastern Ukraine into Russia. Also if the winds are such it could blow over the occupied areas of Ukraine. I am sure Russia is aware of this and would act accordingly. I have seen some graphical pictures of potential radiation exposure areas and it is pretty big. Note that does not mean that whole area would be a ""dead"" zone, just exposed to higher radiation. If Russians blow it with the wind blowing west it appears that Romania would be hit with it. It would continue to travel west at decreasing levels assuming winds move that way. I suspect a dead zone would be a tighter circle around the plant but how big is hard to say. It depends what happens to the fuel rods. Not a nuclear scientist but the fuel rods without cooling could start increasing reactions which would increase radiation. This would increase the size of the dead zone. If they don't do this it will be much closer to the plant. With much larger areas with differing levels of radiation exposure.

Then, you have to make sure to coordinate every single information that comes from Putin's office so nothing unusual shows up.

After that, you have to prevent the different factions that have now formed in Moscow from saying anything, even if they would reaallly like to in order to advance their push for power.

Then, you have to find a deepfake method that deepfake detection algorithms can't detect and whip a perfect deepfake within 6 hours of the first event starting to happen.

220e4eadcb7ea278ec22915b7e92e2b2,14icclh,jpi5dgh,"This narrative rests on three assumptions, all of which are false.

**First assumption:**  That the shot down Elm is a difficult one.   It isn't, for a variety of technical and procedural reasons.  The first being: Elm curves away from the Sixth Floor, and at the point at which it curves away from the sixth floor is as clear a shot as you're going to get.  I live in Dallas, and I've looked out the Sixth Floor window (the location is a museum).

**Second assumption:**  Oswald was a poor shot.  He was *not*.  This is one of many falsehoods perpetuated by Oliver Stone's idiotically fictionalized film.  Stone has since gone on to be an apologist for Putin, go figure.

The distance to target was about 240 *feet*.  Oswald was rated Sharpshooter in 1956.  Only in 1959 on recertification was he downgraded to Marksman which is still a pretty good rating.   Even with a Marksman rating, the targets range between 200 and 500 **YARDS**.  So, at a minimum, Oswald had to be proficient at hitting targets three times the distance to the Lincoln.  In other words, he was initially a qualified sniper, and the only reason that his rating fell is that maintaining such a rating requires practice and or field experience.  However, as I'll illustrate later, his attitude impeded his career aspirations, and this is directly relevant to the events that followed.

**Third assumption:** Oswald was aiming for Kennedy.  This is questionable, since there's no documented instance in which Oswald expresses any personal, direct gripe with or antagonism toward Kennedy in particular. Oswald had a documented gripe against Governor Connally.  In January of 1961, after defecting to the Soviet Union, Oswald began writing then Secretary of the Navy Connally about his ""undesirable"" discharge from the Marine Corps.  He returned to the United States in 1962, after discovering that the Soviet Union was not the egalitarian paradise he'd imagined it to be, and his ""intel"" on the U-2 from his time at MACS-9 was largely useless because the Soviets already had reliable intel.  Oswald had no useful intel on the U-2 to offer the Soviets, and so he was not ""rewarded"" or looked upon as a great Marxist hero... just to give you some idea of the delusions of grandeur which he'd espoused.

It's worth noting that Oswald was court martialed twice, and reprimanded on more than one occasion.  Had he not been demoted and transferred to MACS-9 at El Toro as a radar technician, and had he instead shown an exemplary service record and regard for his chain of command, he certainly could have been assigned a sniper MOS.

The fact of the matter is that Oswald demonstrated a lot of the same characteristics, cognitive and psychological, as many of today's mass shooter incels.

I think a fourth notably false assumption lies in the belief that security measures at Dealey Plaza should have prevented Kennedy's assassination and therefore leads some to erroneously conclude that the only explanation is a conspiracy of some sort.  

This is however ignoring the obvious:  The security measures of the Presidential Detail today are a direct consequence of the events of 22 November 1963.  My classmate's uncle is Clint Hill, the secret service agent seen climbing the back of the Lincoln.  Clint was assigned to Jackie's detail.  Clint is a real person, not Superman, not a CIA plant. He's a real person who spent three decades wracked with real guilt, crawled inside a bottle, became withdrawn from his family, and eventually came out the other side better able to cope with an incident that just happened to involve a larger than life figure (the first President who seemed tangible/accessible to the average American, due to his ability to truly leverage the power of televised media).   Survivor's guilt is real, not a put-on.

And then there's the most glaring fact:  the open top limousine.  If there's a reason that we have a 10-ton vehicle nicknamed the Beast, with 8 inch armor plating and 5 inch thick windows, it is traceable back to the Kennedy Assassination and the findings of the Warren Commission.  If there's a reason we have larger motorcades carrying M4-armed Secret Service agents, and detail sweeps through motorcade routes in the weeks before a Presidential visit, it's because of the Kennedy assassination.

The WTC attacks and the Jan 6 insurrection are similar examples of events that reveal gaps in current security protocols.  In the case of the WTC attacks, it led to the creation of an entirely new org structure under DHS, as well as the creation of FBI Fusion centers which coordinate data between federal and local law enforcement agencies.

We don't live in the world of the movies where events are highly dramatized and Obi Wan is related to the guy who adopts the kid who builds C3P0 only to forget about him for three decades until he coincidentally pops up on the very ship that his inventor seizes and boards.

He'd be insane if the thought he could actually force Putin at gunpoint to change out the MOD leadership (but it could have been attempted anyway). 

I wasn't expecting there to be basically almost no Russian security force response. Are the military and security forces so slow to respond that he can just drive over several days, with the only visible response a few helicopters responding, and a few tractors digging holes in the road to stop him? He takes over the town where the ukrainian war is being prosecuted from with almost no resistance. Does this indicate the soldiers are all exhausted with battle (I think so). Also maybe they don't really care about Putin and the leadership. I think some of the military leadership was against Putin, so they just acquiesced. 

I imagine there were lots of threats against Pr. and eventually they were enough to convince him to take a deal. Lukashenko being involved was also surprising. The deal for his forces to go to Belarus was a way to get rid of Pr until they can kill him. This also makes it possible for wagner's leftover fighters to attack Kyiv from the north. This is obvious to everyone. Lukashenko needs Putin to stay in power probably.

I don't think attacking from Belarus was some brilliant goal that this series of events was planned to end up with, because they could have just gone to Belarus directly. It could still happen that they attack from there! It's a war, Russia is weak and conflicted, crazy things happen. 

I think:

1. Russia internal security is weak, most of the military really is fighting in Ukraine
2. Prigozhin was mad about the bombing on his forces
3. Prigozhin is crazy enough to start attacking and complaining about Russia, he didn't have a real plan, probably thought they'd just agree to some changes
4. But he did send a force of a few thousand soldiers, Russia is that weak that there's hardly anyone left . That explains why Russia was so slow to respond
5. The military thinks the war is stupid, they are fine with not fighting too aggressively against Prigozhin.
6. Oligarchs really did start leaving russia. Putin learned who would flee, but he already knew that, no need for this tricky sequence to trigger that to see who left.
7. Putin negotiated and threatened to get Prigozhin to stop
8. Lukashenko wanted to end this bc his power comes somewhat from putin, he doesn't want it to end
9. Prigozhin sees a way out to go to belarus.
10. Pr could still attack Uk from Belarus, even if we only got here through chaotic and accidental means. Russia will probably still try to kill Prigozhin.",False,1687715382.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jphdeor,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

I don't believe people posting on the internet, especially in a thread like this, find their own opinion more valuable than those of experts. Moreover, I don't believe I should care about whether this person thinks their reasoning is just a guess on the internet or whether they really believe it. 

When it comes to bearing responsibility for what you post online, I truly believe it is not the responsibility of the poster to ensure they have the correct expertise to be able to add something to the discussion. Instead, I argue from the point of view where internet users understand that Reddit isn't the place where experts hold their in domain discourse. As such, I don't think there is necessarily a downside to the OP, only upsides (being lucky and thus being right, allowing for the ego boost). My comment about the lottery was exactly that, I read your previous comment as ""if the reward (whether thats money of ""bragging rights"") is only there because of luck, it's not valuable"". That's why I made the comparison with the lottery, to show that something that can only be attributed to luck, can still be positive. Moreover, the comparison mainly fails because in lotteries there actually is a downside (losing means spending money), whereas the only downside to this comment would be the time invested (and potentially the fact that others are becoming misinformed, but again, I think that's not the responsibility of the poster. Surely you cannot just spread misinformation, but this was clearly framed as speculation, which I think has a place on the internet).

Lastly, why I think that the fact that we are holding a discussion now, is a positive result of the OP, making it even further less useless: because we discussed this comment on a meta level, I can at least confidently say I learned something (your view on the matter, internet stranger). I.e. commenting online is rarely completely useless. The poster holds only a little responsibility, yet allows for discussion. 

But then again... I said that the comment that labeled the OP as ""useless"" was in itself useless, even though it led us to this conversation, which I found very fruitful, so perhaps I should reevaluate my own commenting strategy XD",False,1687700355.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpgnp7k,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

Normally this leads to interesting discussions. But oh well.

This is my last reply and unlike you I mean what I say. You’ll have one more “clever” reply but that’s fine because you still can’t defend the position that Russia wouldn’t be culpable for losing their nukes to Prigozhin in Belarus after “stopping” a coup. I guess that’s how you want to sleep at night. It doesn’t change the fact that Putin’s days are numbered.,False,1687674556.0,t3_14icclh,t1_jpfs7jb,,3,2,0,2,0,0,
