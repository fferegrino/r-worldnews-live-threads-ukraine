Day 250 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the day started with missiles, most other cities were hit with cruise missiles, but Kharkiv was hit by S-300 missiles from Belgorod. There were 4 missiles fired at Kharkiv in total, but only 2 managed to get through to us. There were also some missiles that were fired at Chuhuiv at the same time they hit Kharkiv.

All of the missiles were aimed at our critical infrastructure, leaving a lot of people everywhere in our country without electricity. For us in Kharkiv it was restored after 6 hours, though in some districts it was restored even faster, after 1-2 hours. It took longer in Kyiv, and I’m not sure if it is completely restored there yet.

There was another missile strike in Kharkiv today, which happened around 8:40pm. They fired 3 missiles at us, and 2 of them blew up over Belgorod as always. The last missile did manage to get through and landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. It’s funny that Putin admitted that those strikes on our civilian infrastructure were a response for our attacks on their fleet in Sevastopol. It just shows how weak they really are, they are unable to respond to our military directly, so they attack civilians instead.

Turkey sort of thinks of The Black Sea as a Turkish lake. They control the entrance and the exit, so they think it’s theirs, never mind the fact that there are other countries with ports there too.



And that’s why they drew up The Montreux Convention. It spells out how Turkey will treat countries’ access to and from The Black Sea so that everybody knows what to expect from them. But it doesn’t actually limit Turkey in any way.



Turkey has rules for countries that don’t have any Black Sea coast. Rules for countries that do. Rules for countries that are at war. And rules for countries that are at war with them or their allies.



But it’s Turkey that decides which class to put you in. When Russia invaded Georgia, when Russia invaded Crimea, Turkey didn’t re-classify Russia. But when Russia launched the full-scale invasion, they did. 



Now, Ukraine has a bi-lateral security agreement with Turkey to keep commercial traffic moving.



Now, any interference with commercial shipping in The Black Sea is a direct challenge to Turkeys authority to control traffic there. Turkey could, following the guidelines in The Montreux Convention, re-classify Russia as a country at war with an ally of theirs and close the Bosphorus to all Russian commercial traffic. 



I really don’t know if Putin thinks that he can push the Turks around or not, but I do know that pushing them on the subject of who is in charge of The Black Sea is probably not his best bet for getting them to play nice.",False,1667264239.0,t3_yi04r5,t3_yi04r5,,0,90,0,90,0,0,

what could even be reconfigured to do is explained in this interesting article: https://www.fedscoop.com/mysterious-robotic-ships-headed-to-ukraine/ where it casually mentions Ukrainian military personnel are currently training at a naval base in Virginia.

""Deposits of such non-traditional for Ukraine minerals as beryllium, niobium and tantalum, rare-earth series, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, fluor-spar, apatite, oil shale, and bischofite have been found and proven.

""Recently geologists have proved the viability of further increase in hydrocarbons resources, the discovery and development of new for Ukraine mineral deposits: gold, chrome, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, and rare-earth series.

""The possibility has emerged to extract non-ferrous, rare and noble metals, different types of non-metal raw materials from industrial deposits.

""This powerful mineral-resource potential of Ukraine is not a fortuity. Recent studies have proven that Ukraine is a unique geological region, the formation of which was going on in the course of 3.7 bln years. Its composition is characterized by a great variety of geological structures and their geodynamics, and a variety of geological and ore-bearing formations. Almost all the basic geological structures of European continent converge on the territory of Ukraine: the West and the East European and the Central Eurasian platforms, the Alpine-Carpathian and the Crimean-Caucasian fold systems, great sedimentation sags (Dnipro-Donets’k) and basins (Azov-Black Sea).

""The Ukrainian shield is a special geological structure; it is the oldest pre-Cambrian geological structure, which is a part of the East-European platform. During many centuries of evolution more than seven productive metalogenous impulses took place, forming a great number of powerful deposits. The non-ferrous and less-common metals appeared on later stages of rejuvenation or activation of the shield. This fact explains the wide variety of minerals found here. They include the world richest deposits of iron and manganese ore that have been developed for over a century now, and considerable deposits of titanic, zirconium and uranium ore, which are being actively developed now. The deposits of less-common metals and rare-earth group are of special value. Geologists have stricken Perha deposit of beryllium in Zhytomyr Oblast’, large Azov deposit of rare-earth group in Donets’k Oblast’, Polokhivka and Stankuvate deposits of lithium in Kirovohrad Oblast’.

""One of the new achievements of Ukrainian geologists consisted in determination of auriferousness of Ukraine and in discovery of industrial auric-ore deposits: Muzhiievo and Sauliak in the Carpathians; Bobrykivka in Donbas; Serhiivka, Mais’ke, and Klyntsi within the limits of Ukrainian Shield. The exploitation of the first auric-ore deposits has already begun: Muzhiievo, Sauliak, and Bobrykivka.""

""Manganese ore. Ukraine has the world biggest surveyed resources of manganese ore and is the top producer of manganese-ore and ferroalloy products. Recently the resources of the Dnipro manganese-ore basin were considerably increased and the Velykyi Tokmak deposit was surveyed. The total resources of ore make 2.26 bln tons, including oxidative, oxidative-carbonate and carbonate types.

""Titanium-zirconium ore. In the former USSR Ukraine was the monopolistic producer of titanic concentrates (over 90% of All-Union output). Ukraine has powerful titanium resources; the surveyed ilmenite deposits exceed the world deposits of titanic ore: twelve out of forty known deposits have been surveyed and are exploited. Extraction of titanim concentrate from placer ore is carried out at Irshans’k ore mining and processing enterprise and Upper Dnipro mining and smelting plant. Their summary output covers about 20% of the world market of ilmenite concentrates. Recently they have surveyed the unique Stremyhorod deposits of ledge ilmenite ores associated with gabbro-dolerite and troctolite, the effective developing of which is a strategic task. Besides ilmenite, it’s possible to extract apatite here for mineral fertilizers production, as well as vanadium and scandium. The deposits of this type also include Fedorivs’ke, Vydybor, Paromivka, and Kropyvnia.

""Ores of rare metals. Ukraine is a rare-metal province: the recoverable rare-metal resources are the biggest in Europe. The most important is Ukrainian shield with its 22 rare-metal formations. The most unique and large are such deposits: Perha of beryllium; Azov of zirconium and rare-earth series; Polokhivka, Stankuvate and Shevchenko of lithium; Mazurivka of tantalum-niobium-zirconium ores.""

7396ffbb5a3824d6040de9055b18a4b3,yi04r5,iuj8vtb,"Going to guess the answer here is auto-rotation.

Essentially, if you lose the engine, you can't just ""set it down"" because you need the engine power to descend vertically. If you have no forward momentum with no engine, the blades just stop, and then you fall out of the sky.

Instead, you basically ""glide"" the helicopter to the ground, keeping it moving forwards as well as downwards, and the air moving over the rotors keeps them turning and generating lift.

That looks like exactly what is happening here - right after the hit, the engine ignites and you see the nose drop as the pilot jams the cyclic (directional stick) forwards to increase airspeed, which maximises the amount of lift you get from autorotation and therefore the best control over your landing. Look at how fast it is travelling both before and after the hit, that rapid acceleration combined with a *loss* in altitude is a dead giveaway it's in auto-rotation. If the engine was good, the pilot would pull the collective (throttle) up at the same time as pushing the cyclic forwards, and so the helicopter would stay level as it accelerates. No engine means you can't do this.

At the end, around a minute in, he bleeds off speed really badly by pulling the stick back too far, and the helicopter basically ceases to fly and just falls instead. You see it rise and as it rises and leans back, the blades slow down, and then it starts tumbling, and without the engine there's no source of power to regain control, gravity takes over and it smacks into the ground.

It's semi-decent piloting to maintain auto-rotation with a fire, but a really experienced heli pilot should have been able to get that onto the deck. It's possible that the engine fire sheared something just before he landed but it looks like pilot error finished it off to me.

ATACMS - yes please.

As for Abrams... there's a problem: they eat fuel like nobody's business. They're *GREAT* tanks if you have the logistical capacity to feed them enormous quantities of fuel, and they're not even very picky about what TYPE of fuel, but they gulp it down fast just due to the type of engine they use. There's also a training issue: there are no current Ukrainian troops who know how to use an Abrams.

F15/16s - same problem as the tanks, but even more so: apparently new Western jets are so different from old Soviet stuff that it's ""like magic"". The pilots trained on the old stuff just can't migrate well. Ukraine has chosen a group of pilots to move to the US to train on their use, but even that is only part of the issue: each one of those jets comes with a logistical and support train miles long: they need weapons designed for the planes. They need mechanics trained on their maintenance and repair. They need the right tooling for said repairs (remember the US is on the Imperial system, Ukraine is on metric). They'll need the spare parts and other logistical consumables for their maintenance.

Ukraine is an threat to Russia in three ways that Russia felt must be dealt with.

1. **Parallel mythos.**  Kievan Rus are part of the historical Russia (Russia likes to pretend Moscow is the ""true Russia"" and brush off the city founded 500+ years earlier).  It's a threat if there's a second ""Russian"" identifying group that is more successful/in the limelight - especially if that comes through moving *away from* rather than *into* the former Soviet sphere of influence.  There is a substantial effort to portray Ukrainians as ""wayward Russians"" who need to be brought back into the arms of the ""true Russia"" - by force if necessary.  This also explains all the Nazi and anti-gay bullshit, it's all mythos and self-image.  Also ""Russia stronk"", macho, alpha male... stop me if any of this sounds familiar.

2. **Natural resources.**  This is your lengthy point, above.  There are substantial resources under Donbas/Crimea.  These could be exploited.  More importantly, should Ukraine rise as a powerful producer of these resources, they could threaten or eclipse Russian dominance over these supply lines to Europe, and that's an existential threat.  There's already a lot of oil lines running *through* Ukraine on the way to Europe.

3. **Industrial capacity.**  The warm water ports on the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea are invaluable, but so are the industrial areas of the Donbas, Mariupol (now in ruins), Odessa, the wheat producing parts of Ukraine and the export ports.  Russia taking these would strengthen Russia and weaken Ukraine economically, and play into the resources point above.  Hence the push to take and hold the south.  All of these are resources and riches that, if taken, could be funneled to the ""true Russia"" of Moscow (and St. Petersburg) - exactly as they do in all the other parts of their country.

Specifically, Russia will run out of guns and vehicles before it runs out of men to operate them, and unarmed conscripts can't realistically fight against an enemy with computer guided artillery on the Ukrainian level.

For me, it's going to go down something like this:

1. Russia runs out of equipment to give the mobiks, they're already posting videos of *infantry* being given cobbled together AKs that are as bad if not worse as the ones those tankers had the other day. Stocks and grips taken from completely different *models* not just different eras, there was a video with an AK-74 with a mixture of plum/tan bakelite pistol and foregrips but a wooden stock, from an AKM apparently. Russia also doesn't have an infinite supply of vehicles, and judging from their ""loans"" from Belarus, tanks, APCs, and trucks are all hitting critical levels because maintenance on stored stocks has been so shoddy. Even stuff like the famed stacks of Mosins need an awful lot of man-hours to remove the thick cosmoline and get them able to actually chamber and fire rounds.

2. Underequipped mass infantry forces and hugely rising KIA numbers lead to mass surrender at the front, and revolts of mobiks against commanders at the rear or even back in Russia.

3. This spills over into a more widespread series of protests and riots, which a hugely depleted Russian military and police don't have the equipment or firearms to control.

4. The protests remove Putin from office and Russia goes into freefall.

Lets not trivialize anything.  The day you personally get into a gunfight is a very significant day in your life.

You can make statements like ""at 700 dead per day Russia will lose 1,000,000 soldiers in 3.9 years"".

The war outcome is effected by Russia's willingness to put up with the loss.  If not that, then Russia's ability to replace the losses.  In the case of their willingness the percentage figure is probably a better one.  The fact that they have not rebelled yet suggests that Moscow is in fact willing to endure these kinds of numbers.

Every year the amount of time you have before reaching your life expectancy decreases.  These are not contradictory statements.

For those who might be interested in what that means, 'gassing' is how much of the exhaust gas that pushes the bullet down the barrel gets redirected back into the weapon the cycle the bolt. An over-gassed weapon causes the bolt to move rearward more violently - which can overcome any obstructions like mud or sand that could seize the weapon up, but comes with the cost of increased recoil in most instances.

You have to believe or accept the possibility, first, of the unified nature of all things.  Quantum mechanics, the universe, notions of God, God, angels.....these are all human descriptions of the same concept.  Love is what connects, while fear is what destroys.

Next, you have to accept or believe that your reality is manifested by your beliefs.   

Lastly, you have to realize that you can control your reality through insight gained through observing your thoughts (i.e. mindfulness, being present with compassionate curiosity, things like that).

And anyone who goes, ""Oh, he just wasn't skilled enough, I can take Ukraine, I will use nukes to win,"" will also fail.  Because we will shoot down any such nukes, and/or he will be destroyed in the attempt to use them, before he can actually use them.
