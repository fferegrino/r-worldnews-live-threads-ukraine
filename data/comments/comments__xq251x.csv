- Ukraine has pressed its offensive operations in the north-east of the country over the last few days. Units are making slow advances on at least two axes east from the line of the Oskil and Siverskyy Donets rivers, where forces had consolidated following their previous advance earlier in the month.

- Russia is mounting a more substantive defence than previously, likely because the Ukrainian advance now threatens parts of Luhansk Oblast as voting in the referendum on accession to the Russian Federation closes.

- Heavy fighting also continues in the Kherson region where the Russian force on the right bank of the Dnipro remains vulnerable. Russia continues its grinding attempts to advance near Bakhmut in the Donbas even while it faces severe pressure on its northern and southern flanks. This is likely due to political pressure as Russia is using forces that could otherwise reinforce the other flanks.

Day 217 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was quiet again, no missiles were fired at us, but there were a lot of air raid alerts at the times when they usually launch their missiles at. It could have been because of Russian aircraft activity, but at times people saw some missiles being fired from the direction of Belgorod, which could have been their AA, but it also might be just that they were firing their missiles at something other than Kharkiv, and we just don’t know where they landed.

With less missiles being fired at Kharkiv, it seems like they switched their targets to Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro. They have barely been bombed before this month, but in the past 1-2 weeks they get about the same amount of missiles fired at them daily as at Kharkiv during the previous months. But because those cities are far away from the frontline, missiles fired at them are much easier to intercept than those fired at Kharkiv from a distance of less than 50 km.

I don’t understand why they are wasting their missiles fighting against civilians far away from the frontline, while they are losing on the battlefield. With yesterday’s missile strike in Kharkiv they hit 2 big transformer substations, and electricity is still not fixed everywhere, but that just hurts civilians, it doesn’t help their war effort, it didn’t stop the trains or anything like that, just wasted their missiles for no reason. Do they really still think that they can make us revolt against our government by hurting us?

Kristoffer Böttzauw, director of the Danish Energy Agency, says this afternoon that it is expected that the gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 will soon be empty of gas.

- Half of the gas is out now, and that we expect the pipes to be emptied on Sunday, he says during the authorities' briefing.

He explains that there is gas in the pipes, even if they are not in use, because, among other things, it provides stability in the pipes when they lie on the seabed.

Kristoffer Böttzauw also states that the Danish Energy Agency considers that these are deliberate actions.

The same announcement was made by Mette Frederiksen (S) on Tuesday evening, where she stated that it is the authorities' ""clear assessment"" that the leaks have occurred as a result of a deliberate act.

- It is the authorities' assessment that these are deliberate actions. It is not an accident, said the prime minister.

На второй работе забрали официанта, ему 19 лет и он никогда не служил в армии

Также надеются, что ЕС развалится в этом-следующем году, ибо этот год для Европы будет голодным и холодным. Сказали, некоторые области Украины заберет Венгрия и Польша   
Еще говорят, что США к 2024 году перестанет существовать, а будет как отдельные страны, но не как страна   
Все очень ждут, когда в СшА будет импичмент и придёт к власти Трамп, потому что надеятся, что США и Россия заключат мир, ибо каждый понимает, что это война двух государств на территории Украины   
Сейчас в России в армию забирают всех. Ты можешь идти по улице и тебя задержит полиция, отвезет в участок и вручит повестку на войну и в трёхдневный срок надо явиться иначе тебя посадят в тюрьму на 10-15 лет

""But one senior US official and a US military official both said Russia is still the leading suspect – assuming that the European assessment of deliberate sabotage is borne out – because there are no other plausible suspects with the ability and will to carry out the operation.

“It’s hard to imagine any other actor in the region with the capabilities and interest to carry out such an operation,” the Danish military official said.

Russia has requested a UN Security Council meeting on the damaged pipeline this week – something the senior US official said is also suspicious. Typically, the official said, Russia isn’t organized enough to move so quickly, suggesting that the maneuver was pre-planned.

If Russia did deliberately cause the explosions, it would be effectively sabotaging its own pipelines: Russian state company Gazprom is the majority shareholder in Nord Stream 1 and the sole owner of Nord Stream 2.



US warned European allies this summer that Nord Stream pipelines could be attacked

But officials familiar with the latest intelligence say that Moscow would likely view such a step as worth the price if it helped raise the costs of supporting Ukraine for Europe.

This is the exact strategy used by Nixon / US to bring about negotiations to get the US out of Vietnam. This is known as the [madman theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theory) and it was directly attributed to helping ending the Vietnam War when the US was taking a beating..

>I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the nuclear button"" and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.

Sounds familiar right?

>I call it the Madman Theory, Ivan. I want the Ukrainians and the West to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, ""for God's sake, you know Putin is obsessed with beating NATO. We can't restrain him when he's angry—and he has his hand on the tactical nuclear button"" and Zelenskyy himself will be in Prague in two days begging for peace.

If we are using cold-war Era realpolitik to analyze this situation, we should conclude that Russia will not use nuclear weapons unless facing an imminent existential threat (a real one, not a contrived one) and we should not base policy on the assumption that they will utilize nuclear weapons as it gives Russia an artificially better negotiating position.

In my opinion, you can judge what most international actors are willing to due by assuming they are pragmatic actors with no morals or ego, only the goal of advancing their position.

There are no outcomes to using a nuclear weapon that advance Russia's position. If they use a big nuke and start a nuclear war with the West.... we all die and Russia gains nothing. If Russia uses a small nuclear weapon in Ukraine they will lose their only benefactors - India and China - who both see that as a huge red line. Again, Russia would end up in a worse position.

The only thing Russia actually benefits from is threatening to use nuclear weapons... and that's what they're best at.

Scenario 1: Russia did it - In the past they have tried to force Germany to use NS2 instead of NS1, remember the whole turbine malarkey. None of the attempts worked out tho because russias reasons why NS1 couldnt be used anymore were always easily debunked - now both pipes of NS1 are knocked out but one pipe of NS2 remains functional.

most plausible scenario right now in my eyes

&#x200B;

Scenario 2: PUTIN did it - not personally but for rather personal reasons. The only way Germany realisticly saw to use the pipelines in the near future was after a regime change in moscow. Russian oil and gas tycoons were aware of that. Putin might feel vulnurable at the moment and felt like he needed to take away any monetary motivation the russian elite could have had to replace him.

plausible but highly speculative

&#x200B;

Scenario 3: US did it - given Bidens threats against NS in the past many people online rushed to this conclusion. However the risk/reward calculation from the perspective of the US would be completely nuts. No gas was running through these pipelines, NS2 was never going to open and the consequences from a direct attack at two allies (DEN & GER) would be unpredictable 

this scenario becomes less plausible the longer you think about it

&#x200B;

Scenario 4: UA did it - also not very plausible given that UA does not have the capabilities to conduct such an operation undetected. The decision makers in Kyiv are also much better informed about the reasons why germany approves or disapproves certain weapon systems than people on twitter and reddit and know that russian gas is not a factor in the weapon shipments

highly unlikely

 — 
US officials believe that the likelihood Russian President Vladimir Putin will use a tactical nuclear weapon in his struggling war in Ukraine is perhaps the highest it has been since Russia invaded in February — but is still not probable, multiple officials familiar with the latest intelligence tell CNN.

The intelligence community is closely watching for any signs that Putin’s calculus has changed after the Russian president was widely perceived last week to be escalating his past threats to use nuclear weapons......",False,1664412927.0,t3_xq251x,t3_xq251x,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

3) Annexation would then invoke the defense pact of the CSTO and it would make Russia look extremely weak if the rest of the CSTO and any other Russian allies with a mutual defense pact refuse to help, instead telling Russia to get bent.

Well... ethics.

I can't speak to everyone in Ukraine, their government, or their leadership... but it sure seems like they're trying to tell people the truth (I mean there's probably some spin, censorship, or lying by omission, but I'd expect at least some of that to protect their operations and soldiers lives, no?).  Compared to what's being presented by the russians... well the Ukrainian narratives align a lot more closely with the reality we're seeing.  So... this implies that there's an actual moral code they're following.

I understand that the agreements established the factual/temporary loss of territory for Ukraine. But wouldn't the alternative have been Russia continuing the invasion and conquering all of Ukraine?

To my knowledge, Ukraine was in no condition to fight a full invasion at that point in time. Not even with hastily delivered western weapons.
The time that the Minsk agreements bought enabled Ukraine to reinforce and modernize its army to a point that they now can beat Russia.

The idea that in 2014 the West could have pressured Russia to a point that they would have retreated from all occupied territories seems pretty unlikely to me. With or without pipelines.

Edit:
Regarding NS 1&2. I think many tend to give Russia / Putin way to much credit, when they are depicted as a mastermind that manipulated and controlled the West (and particularly Germany). As we see now, the pipelines never made Europe dependent to a point that it couldn't turn against Russia.
Yes it hurts economically, but Russia even more. Mutual dependency is a proven tool in diplomacy. That Russia would break this deal so willingly, despite hurting itself, was not the desired outcome.

That article has, as you'd expect, an extremely misleading headline.  Russian ships *and* subs are routinely in the Baltic.  The people who sighted them in this instance, quote ""see them every week.""  And they were not seen doing anything in particular.  No one's going to have that footage.  Nobody saw the Russians doing it.  

So all it does to the case against Russia is demonstrate opportunity.  But really they always had opportunity since the bombs could have been placed there weeks before, and ships are not even necessary to achieve this sort of destruction if bombs were delivered via tunnel repair bots (note, *not* pigs, stop with the pigs, pigs move with the flow of gas and can't stop and attach to walls; it would be robotic pipe inspection units).  

And really with three pipelines getting damaged at the same exact time, both those other methods (tunnel delivery system or prior surface-to-depth delivery detonated on remote weeks later) are much more likely than it being the work of any ship or convoy of ships seen in the area at the time.  Though the ships may have been monitoring the explosion to make sure it happened the way they wanted it.

New York's news paper The World pushed a fundraising drive which raised a large part of the money needed. There was many other forms of fundraising though, even the poem ""The New Colossus"" was used in an art show acting as a fund raiser. The US citizens paid for the erection of The Statue of Liberty.

The concrete and steel pipelines were torn open by apparent underwater explosions as strong as a minor earthquake, leading to three large gas leaks east of the Danish island of Bornholm.

Al-jazeera's bias is, exactly what it is:  a mid-east focused network based in Qatar that has journalists in Egyptian prisons.  It doesn't mean all the information you get about Egypt is negative (but they'll probably say it very loudly), and it would be a logical fallacy to ignore their reportage on Egypt on that basis.  It's still a great network.  

CNN's bias is *keeping people watching*.  The sky is always falling, nuclear war is always a few keystrokes away, and it is 10:00 pm and you're eating mcnuggets, but do you know where your chickens are?",1664417557.0,1664417401.0,t3_xq251x,t1_iqbcr05,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

The mobilization, the nuclear threats, the annexation of territories, the targeting of Ukrainian critical infrastructure, threatening sanctions on Ukrainian gas pipelines and now the sabotaging of the Nordstream pipelines all fit into a strategy of escalating outside of the conventional battlefield. The goal is to demotivate Ukrainian and European audiences by instilling fear, undermine European governments through energy warfare and domestic unrest while simultaneously buying time by throwing bodies at the front.

The goal is to, yet again, ""outlast"" Europe, from the idea that European audiences fear further escalation, fear high energy prices and essentially ""do not have the stomach"" for suffering such as the Russian people do. We see this reflected most recently in the rhetoric employed by Medvedev as well regarding nuclear escalation, where he essentially states that NATO will not go above a certain limit of escalation because they won't consider Ukraine worth that type of risk. 

Essentially, it's continuing on the previous strategy, but now using harsher measures to ""up the cost"" for further EU/US support to Ukraine. The question remains whether this will work, of course. But it's not as if Russia has a lot of other options, at this stage.

However, the important part is that we can place these nuclear threats into a larger strategy wherein Russia seeks to find an exit through negotiations in which they have a favorable position over Ukraine due dwindling western support.",False,1664382910.0,t3_xq251x,t1_iq90pn1,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

>WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The United States and Germany on Wednesday unveiled an agreement on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under which Berlin pledged to respond to any attempt by Russia to use energy as a weapon against Ukraine and other Central and Eastern European countries.
>
>The pact aims to mitigate what critics see as the strategic dangers of the $11 billion pipeline, now 98% complete, being built under the Baltic Sea to carry gas from Russia's Arctic region to Germany.
>
>U.S. officials have opposed the pipeline, which would allow Russia to export gas directly to Germany and potentially cut off other nations, but President Joe Biden's administration has chosen not to try to kill it with U.S. sanctions.
>
>Instead, it has negotiated the pact with Germany that threatens to impose costs on Russia if it seeks to use the pipeline to harm Ukraine or other countries in the region.
>
>If Russia attempts to ""use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine,"" Germany will take steps on its own and push for actions at the EU, including sanctions, ""to limit Russian export capabilities to Europe in the energy sector,"" the statement said.
>
>""We also will certainly look to hold any future German governments accountable for the commitments that they have made in this,"" the [U.S.] official said.

It'd only be kicking the can down the road, Putin would come back later with even more outrageous demands and keep using the threat of nukes until he gets what he wants. In fact, it'd only make nuclear war more likely in the long run, as making nuke threats is shown as a viable strategy.

> Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.

So, in the modern (UN) era, your question can be distilled down to whether sabotage of energy pipelines amounts to ""an armed attack against a Member of the United Nations"".  If the pipelines were vital to some such nation, eg vital to the supplier's economy or the consumer's energy demands, then I *guess* it is arguable that such explosive sabotage could indeed amount to an armed attack against those nations; I am unclear whether there is any precedent for such attacks in international waters, or whether to date ""armed attack"" has always been interpreted to occur on the territory of the victim.

However, the fact that the pipelines were inactive and expected to remain so works against this argument.  Indeed, all involved nations have indicated that they can get by without supply through these pipelines.  So then the question is muddied by whether their sabotage is an attack on any of the *nations* at all, rather than just the assets in international waters of some private companies.

I've never voted for Donald Trump, and I never will. I haven't voted for a Republican in decades and I'm not going to start now. Your content is, frankly, identical to content I can see at any other US Politics discussion forum and is as interesting as watching paint dry.

The content you posted 13 hours ago appears to be an exact ctrl-v of the content you posted 7 days ago, and my guess is that the content you had removed was also identical. You're not 'discussing' anything, which is part of the problem.

You may have missed when /u/donkey-whistle was doing something similar to what you're doing now. He'd post the same message you're posting (although clearly not as verbose) repeatedly. Donkey-whistle asserted the same thing you are as well - that it was relevant to Ukraine and belonged in the thread in spite of the fact that it was roughly the 100th time he'd posted the same message. When his content started to be removed, he threw a fit too, and eventually he was (apparently) banned and never posted on this site ever again.

We're at day 217 of the invasion, and for many of us we're in year 8 of following the conflict. The political situation is well known.

You see the snowballing, right? 

Once a smaller no-fly zone is required it would probably need to span the entirely of Ukraine to be effective, and is already in place of the rest of Europe which would likely become the world. 

I have heard talk of the destruction of the Black Sea fleet which also seems a reasonable assumption. 

That stuff is going to be *required*. Beyond that we might well see the destruction of every Russian military asset outside the borders of Russia, to remove the threat of Russian  force-projection throughout the world.

You first need to obtain a fk tonne of Uranium   


You then need to separate out the useable U235 which makes up <2% of your Uranium from the much less useful U238   


This typically requires thousands of industrial centrifuges,    


To make a bomb you can either fully enrich or enrich to a reasonable percentage then use your enhanced Uranium in a reactor to produce Plutonium   


Whichever way you go, you need to spend millions of dollars and thousands of hours to produce around 5-8kg of your chosen fissile material 

  
If you've gone the Uranium route you then have the option to build a simple gun type bomb like Tall Boy (not massively efficient but relatively simple)   


Or you can build an implosion device (like fat man)   
In which case you need to use various mixtures and densities of plastic explosive to cause your ball of fissile material to compress in on itself   


To achieve this you also need a load of extremely sensitive and accurate detonators which are difficult to make and heavily controlled   


Get it wrong and your bomb wont work.   


Now assuming you want to do a little better than the chaps in 1940 you can build an industrial factory to extract tritium from water and use this to boost your bomb   


Going to the next step and building a full on Hydrogen bomb is another order of magnitude in difficulty  


Also note that it's hard to hide what you are doing, the centrifuges require masses of space, it's impossible to stop your centrifuges or reactor leaking some isotopes into the atmosphere which will be detected,

Uranium: A uranium bomb is pretty easy to build. If you shoot a slug of it into a bigger ball of it, boom nuke. The problem is that you need a very specific type of very rare uranium, which needs to be isolated. Since it's so similar to normal uranium this requires a massive industrial project. There are no two ways around it, and everyone will see you doing it.

Plutonium: Is much easier to get the material, it's a byproduct of some commercial reactors. The problem is getting it to go boom, or rather to go boom ""slowly"". The problem is that it explodes so violently that it throws itself apart before becoming a proper nuke. The engineering effort behind this is enormous.

For instance, the US is already delivering LNG to Europe through several specialized delivery spots. Destroying pipelines that are either currently not in use or never used doesn’t really help. If the excuse is to promote gas sales, it’s very suspicious that the two pipes of NS1 and one of the two pipes of NS2 were the ones destroyed. That leaves one pipe of NS2, so Russia could deliver gas to Germany through the pipeline that never opened. 

Destroying the pipelines really helps Russia. Gazprom has several contracts it isn’t delivering on of gas already sold to Germany that should be delivered. So far they have been able to use the excuse of “maintenance” to avoid paying penalties but eventually even that excuse fails. With the two operational pipes completely destroyed, Gazprom has an unassailable excuse to not perform its obligations without penalty. Even better, since NS2 was only half-destroyed, Russia can argue that unless Germany finally opens NS2, Germany is the one defaulting on the contract, not the Russian-owned Gazprom. 

That is aside from the destruction serving as a clear threat to all the other under seas pipelines, including the one just opened between Poland and Norway. The other big tell is that Russia is not calling for an investigation to find the culprit and declare war on them. Destroying a pipeline like this is an act of war on the two countries that co-own it unless it was done by one of the two of them. When Denmark’s PM said that this was sabotage but not an act of war, she was saying that it couldn’t have been the US. That leaves the only suspects as Russia and Germany.

""Consequences of a nuclear strike: If a nuclear strike is carried out, its consequences will be immediate and catastrophic. Quick enough so that Russia does not have time to carry out another one. We do not know NATO’s reaction, the closest thing is Gen Hodges’ example of the destruction of the black sea fleet. This will create a large gap in the Russian air defense network through which NATO forces can enter. Arestovich believes the west will respond with conventional strikes because Ukraine is a country that voluntarily gave up its nukes and received guarantees in exchange, and if nukes are used against them this would be very bad for the world. Arestovich says that Putin should fear a limited nuclear exchange with the US and UK less than a conventional response because a 3500 salvo of Tomahawks and 3 more salvos like this within 24 hours and 2500 planes in the air at once would leave nothing intact in Russia.""

1. Russia unilaterally decided to close NS1 based on a false pretext. They could always turn them back on. But decided to shut it off indefinitely...
2. Those gas pipeline haven't been in use for quite some time and it's really a non issue.
3. Since it's a non issue, there is basically no reason for anyone in the west to destroy them.
4. Russia is currently escalating the situation around the referendum and suddenly the pipeline gets bombed.. That's an incredible coincidence.
5. Suddenly propaganda that the US blew them up starts being regurgitated everywhere that Biden wanted to put an end to NS2. Which they did because NS2 was never used. It didn't mean to ""destroy"" it. But the irony is that out of 4 lines, only 1 line of NS2 didn't get destroyed. So the best they could find was that Biden wanted to ""destroy"" NS2... But only NS1 got destroyed..
6. Russia is the one pushing for NS2 to be used.. Remember they closed NS1 for this purpose.

Closing NS1 proves us that Russia is very much able and willing to sanction themselves. Nobody was talking about the pipelines except Russia. With or without the pipelines, it doesn't change anything for business. Europe could use LNG terminals while having these pipelines unused.

Russia could destroy NS1 to force europe to use NS2. But it's possible that they were ready to destroy NS2 also to simply put the blame on the west and try to make maximum harm to europe. Russia is reaching a point of no return so for them, it make sense to destroy it now because they know that it will make no sense to destroy it in 10 years. And if they don't destroy it, it's not going to get used ever. But destroying it now can be used to sow fear in people's mind that Europe will freeze to death and to beg Russia to save them... At least that's how they're picturing it in their head.

But he won't do that, because it'll mean he looks weak to his rivals, and make his position as president-for-life untenable.

I mean, he could shoot himself - but that won't guarantee an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine either, as another dick-swinging ""strong""-man might take his place and decide to ""prove himself"" by showing the world that he could succeed where Putin failed.

It's no wonder so many of the new ""recruits"" from Russia are already breaking their own legs, fleeing the country, or calling the ""how do I surrender"" hotline, rather than participate in combat.

> Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities ***would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender***.

Accordingly, I don't think that would be the US's response.",1664372258.0,1664371416.0,t3_xq251x,t1_iq8boz2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

\-unmanned UGVs have already been used so longevity is a given; the ability to shepard it in with a person doing manual guidance until it reaches the operational zone isn't unthinkable.  Even Russia has large unguided autonomous torpedoes, though, so the principles are *known,* just overkill for this application

\-any nation worth its salt has done underwater surveys, including the Soviet Union (which the Ukrainian ministry of defense should have access to).  A depth of even 2-3 meters is enough to be near-invisible to the crude sensors available to the Russians.

\-if you're really worried about it go the Italian route, have a diver on top guide it near the target area.  Once it's within 5-10km, it's golden.  It's basically a semi-autonomous narco-sub.

\-you don't need it to go underwater 100% from Odessa on.

Sensorwise you'd probably have a standard GPS + a few kalman-filtered accelerometers for 6-axis, a depth sensor, and a forward facing sonar (optional).  Pop a single antenna out of water at 5-10km out to get a GPS fix, point it at the target, and let it go; in WW2 even unguided torpedo launches could be successful at that range against *moving* targets, and you really only need a 1:100 level of accuracy.  There are various ways to ensure it goes ""bang"" like magnetic anomaly detectors, inertial setups, GPS correction, etc, and if it grounds just a bit that says ""if in target area & velocity = 0 for too long, kaboom"".  You want to avoid the depth in the area, staying just deep enough to prevent easy visual & radar spotting.

You don't have to hit it head on, although that's doable; I'm not 100% on the structural rigidity of a bridge vs a quarter ton or half ton of HE going off under it, but I figure if it'll snap a naval vessel in two it'll probably do a good bit vs a civilian bridge.

When the revolution happened it was basically dumb masses led by tyrants vs. intelligent people led by impotent, dying czardom which outlived itself. The new ideology won and made sure that those capable of new revolt are stripped of everything, killed or sent to Siberia. Some managed to flee to Europe and North America.

Then there were years filled with starvation, genocides and more suppression of free will. Millions were killed again. 

Then there was ww2 that united most of the already suffering people against the enemy from outside. So instead of rising up against the oppressor inside, they fought the enemy from outside. And again millions died followed by even more millions killed by the regime after the war. 

All of that plus many years of ussr before it finally collapsed left a huge mark on the collective unconscious. Then there were 90s when on one hand people got their freedom, but on the other hand the worst part of that trauma came to power. 

So Russians got a glimpse at freedom and a little bit of taste of the ideology that’s not anti-human but what they failed to realize is that they were still led by the same oppressive regime, that adopted to modern society partially. 

They have that fear of revolting against oppressive authority still living inside their subconscious.

The ""Right Wing"" main players are 3 parties:
1) Fratelli d'Italia, which rocked over 25% of votes. Over the last 1/2 years rebranded itself from more to the right than the others into a more ""governement"" force. 
Still very right wing but has a different image than the Lega. For several reasons it's the ""main party"" voted by fascists, some elected people are definitely fascist but Meloni doesn't seem to be too extreme herself. Also declared themselves strongly Pro-NATO. 
Remember that Italy historically had a strong dislike for ""Commies"". 

2) Lega, the right wing back 5 years ago comes from a background of being a ""middle high class northern Italy businessmen + northern people that despise the South"" . 
Back in the days they spoke about stuff like more federalism, different models of taxations and whatever to reduce the toll on northern regions.

From when Salvini became the leader, It grew into being a more generalized nationalistic party and... Quite frankly, it was just the ""racism party"". For months all yoy would hear from Salvini was about the immigrant routes. 
In the last year they fell really bad. 

3) Berlusconi's party, God only knows how, has basically the same amount of votes of Salvini. 
Used to be mostly about economical interests of middle class (and as always, It was actually about big capitalist powers getting benefits) and sitting between the Italian left and the real right wing. 
Currently Berlusconi is an old fart which I don't get still does politics, but the party itself isn't really pro-Russia. If you heard anything about this topic, it's that Berlusconi had contacts back in the days with Putin and now tries to play It cool to not look too much pro-Russia... But still winks a bit towards those that dislike the idea of paying a lot for gas. 

Essentially, pro-Russia right wing in Italy is fucked by definition, and Lega in the governement will have to play It down. 

If they don't, even with FdI big numbers there is the risk that the Left organizes itself, again, and gets the job.

I'll have to use [this](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-chain-command-potential-russian-nuclear-strikes-2022-03-02/) as the source since the actual document released by Russia doesn't seem to wanna load for me.

As for the Soviet underwater surveys - those were presumably conducted while the Soviet Union still existed, which was almost 30 years before the Kerch Bridge was finished. The underwater topography of that area was totally changed by the Russians in the construction of the bridge. 

As for the sensor detection, the primary way of undersea detection is by using SONAR, where the depth doesn't matter. Any Russian sub or destroyer in the area would be able to hear this fucking thing if it has an engine strong enough to push a torp + a half ton of HE 700km. 

The point I was making with the shallowness of the area is that it becomes incredibly easy to run aground. At that shallow of a depth your margin for error gets very low and the topography of the ground can shift rapidly.  The area is also full of mud volcanoes, more than 70 in fact. Running in an area this shallow makes it incredibly easy to get stuck.

As for a guidance system, you basically have to hit a support. If you do not hit a support there is 35m of open air to dissipate the blast between the warhead and the deck. Even a half ton of HE is not enough to mulch through several meters of rebar concrete. Magnetic anomaly detectors wouldn't work as this isn't a ship, but a bridge. Inertial and GPS guidance systems might work, but bear in mind this thing is presumably moving at high speeds, underwater, towards a relatively small target while evading Russian CIWS fire. Small amounts of latency or inaccuracy would render this irrelevant.
