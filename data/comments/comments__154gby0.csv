""What could be shot down is being shot down,” Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Air Force Command of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said on national television.

“Of course, we would like to shoot down more.”

Russia’s third consecutive night of attacks on Odesa has left one person dead. At least 19 were also injured by an overnight Russian attack on Mykolaiv.

Ihnat said that it is “no possibility” to shoot down Russia’s Oniks and Kh-22 missiles with Ukraine’s current air defense systems because of how fast they fly.

“We need means, we need to reinforce the southern regions, our port cities, with means, in particular, against ballistic missiles,” he said. “Systems such as Patriot or SAMP-T could provide protection for this region.”

The Oniks missile, he said, “is designed to destroy watercraft, ships. It flies at a speed of more than 3,000 km per hour... When entering the target, the missile can fly at an altitude of 10-15 meters above the water to destroy the ship, which makes it difficult to detect and, accordingly, shoot down by the air defense means.""""",False,1689863456.0,t3_154gby0,t3_154gby0,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

>Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative has been carefully prepared in series of steps over the last few months. This is not a sudden move, this is a deliberate strategy. 
>
>The destruction of #Kakhovka dam has obliterated irrigation systems — with 94% in Kherson, 74% in Zaporizhia, and 30% in Dnipropetrovsk now lacking a water source. The ramifications stretch beyond Ukraine's borders, affecting nations that rely on its food supplies — notably grains — for their food security.
>
>The three key Ukrainian ports have been blocked from shipping #commodities over the last three months. As a result of recent Russian attacks on infrastructure in Odesa Oblast, 60,000 tonnes of grain were destroyed in the port of Chornomorsk (one of the three key ports for the Black Sea Grain Initiative). Odesa has also been under Russian attacks. Russia's Defence Ministry said on Wednesday it would deem all ships travelling to Ukrainian ports to be potential carriers of military cargo and their flag countries to be parties to the conflict on the Ukrainian side. Ukraine has proposed sending grain ships via the territorial waters of nearby NATO nations but sources told 
@gCaptain that the US Navy shut down the request to protect ships near NATO shores.  
>
>The Russian demands are clear: logistics, freight & shipment of Russian grain and fertilizers must be ensured, Russian banks reconnected to SWIFT and supplies of spare parts for agricultural machinery resumed. At its core, this move by Russia is a calculated pressure tactic aimed at the West, with the intent of obtaining approval for Rosselkhozbank's inclusion in SWIFT, thereby contravening the prevailing sanctions regime. Achieving this milestone would pave the way for the efficient freight, logistics, and shipping of Russian food commodities and fertilizers, setting a precedent for circumventing Western sanctions and injecting much-needed forex liquidity into the Russian economy.  
>
>Russia is ready to trigger Food Crisis 2.0 if necessary and the Global South will suffer the most. If Ukraine is unable to export food, the population of the poorest countries will be on the verge of survival. In addition, the global economy will suffer. The price of grain will increase and not all countries will be able to afford to buy agricultural products, which means that the price of food will increase significantly: flour, grains, meat. 
>
>By manufacturing the conditions conducive for Food Crisis 2.0, Russia stands to wield significant leverage over African and Asian countries, given their heavy dependence on Russian and Ukrainian commodities. This, in turn, serves to exert additional pressure on the West to acquiesce to Russia's demands.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-20-23/index.html

""Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that its third consecutive night of attacks on Odesa is continued retaliation for Ukraine’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and claimed that the its strikes targeted facilities associated with Ukraine’s seaborne attack drones.

""Tonight, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued to deliver retaliatory strikes with high-precision sea and air-based weapons against production shops and storage sites for unmanned boats in the areas of Odesa and Chornomorsk,"" said the daily statement from the Ministry.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say that Russia’s strikes destroyed civilian infrastructure associated with grain exports at Odesa’s port. One Ukrainian, a security guard, was killed when a civil administration building in the city was destroyed.

“While attacking the ports of the grain deal, causing damage to the port infrastructure, the terrorists also hit civilian infrastructure,” Oleh Kiper, head of Odesa regional military administration, said on Telegram.

“They destroyed an administrative building in the center of Odesa, where the blast wave damaged several other buildings, including residential ones.”

The Russian Defense Ministry also claimed that it destroyed fuel infrastructure facilities and ammunition depots of the Ukrainian military near the city of Mykolaiv.

Some background: Ukrainian officials have claimed Kyiv's responsibility for Monday's strike on the key bridge linking the annexed Crimean peninsula to the Russian mainland – a vital supply line for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and a personal project for President Vladimir Putin.

The nearly 12-mile crossing, also known as the Kerch Bridge, is the longest in Europe and holds huge strategic and symbolic importance for Moscow. Monday’s attack was the second on the bridge since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, after a fuel tanker exploded while crossing it in October.""",False,1689863731.0,t3_154gby0,t3_154gby0,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

The war has some attritional elements to it as Ukraine attacks Russian logistics and artillery to force local attrition in the lines, which doesnt mean it has become a war of attrition (one where the strategy has shifted to a war of production between the Ukranian and Russian industries and economies themselves).

Right now Ukraine is shaping up while pushing trying to force a breakthrough, while at the same time it continues to build up strenght to take advantadge ls increasingly worse Russian positions. 

Ukraine's top general Zalzhny, talks about the challenges and his unwillingness to throw everything in sub optimal conditions to please foreigners while, correctly, noting he is being expected to do what the US would not without an adequate airforce:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/14/ukraine-military-valery-zaluzhny-russia/

I think the big push, if a breakthrough doesnt happen sooner, will be in 2024 as Ukraine is stronger and Russia weaker than ever. Of vital importance will be Russia's lack of rotation, which means the entire frontline forces will be forced tl remain trenched for a year, winter included, with increasingly worse supplies if the big push is 2024.

3d7688bbecbd9e081e9421f310b43b4c,154gby0,jspepqy,"By and large counteroffensive is an infantryman’s fight (squad, platoon and company level) supported by artillery along most of the frontline. That is why, first, progress is measured by yards/meters and not km/miles given reduced mobility, and, second, mechanized formations are rarely deployed due to lack of enablers for maneuver. This includes insufficient quantities of mine-clearing equipment, air defenses, ATGMs etc.
Ukrainian forces have still not mastered combined arms operations at scale. Operations are more sequential than synchronized.

The AFU by default have switched to a strategy of attrition relying on sequential fires rather than maneuver. This is the reason why cluster munitions are critical to extend current fire rates into the fall: weakening Russian defenses to a degree that enables maneuver.

Minefields are a problem as most observers know. They confine maneuver space and slow advances. But much more impactful than the minefields per se on Ukraine’s ability to break through Russian defenses is the AFU’s inability to conduct complex combined arms operations at scale.
Lack of a comprehensive combined arms approach at scale makes Ukrainian forces more vulnerable to Russian ATGMs, artillery etc. while advancing. So it's not just about equipment. Additional modern Western weapons and aircraft are needed and will be helpful but not decisive without better integration of fire and maneuver at scale.

There is a dearth of artillery barrels that is difficult to address given production rates and delivery timelines.

The character of this offensive will only likely change if there is a more systematic approach to breaking through Russian defenses, perhaps paired with or causing a severe degradation of Russian morale, that will lead to a sudden or gradual collapse of Russian defenses. Otherwise, this will remain a bloody attritional fight with reserve units being fed in incrementally in the coming weeks and months.

Russians had no need to deploy operational reserves yet to fend off Ukrainian attacks. There is also evidence of reduced impact of HIMARS strikes due to effective Russian countermeasures (the measures are not specified though).

Russian forces, even if severely degraded and lacking ammo, are likely capable of delaying, containing or repulsing individual platoon- or company-sized Ukrainian advances unless these attacks are better coordinated and synchronized along the broader frontline. Some Ukrainian assaults were stopped by Russian ATGMs even before reaching the first minefield (we wrote about a similar case of an unsuccessful MRAP attack in the previous sitrep).

Quality of Ukrainian officers and NCOs appears excellent and morale remains high. However, there are some force quality issues emerging with less able bodied and older men called up for service now. Soldiers fighting on the frontline are all too aware that lack of progress is often more due to poor tactics, lack of coordination between units, red tape and Soviet style thinking.

The minefields alone are beatable, but it takes time to drive the narrow lane through them to get armour through, and in that time they get targeted by artillery which spots them far faster than in previous wars due to drones.

So for now they have switched from manoeuvre to attrition in the hopes to A. Wear down Russian artillery capacity in places or overall, or B. find a weak spot along the extremely long front. They can then switch back to combined arms manoeuvre.

Ukraine is attacking front line artillery capabilities and logistics as much as it is trenches, because Russia needs to be able to punish reduced mobility in order for minefields to be effective. If their artillery is effectively diminished, then the AFU can bring up short-range air defenses to punish helicopters and planes, leaving very little to combat Ukrainian armor. The last link is infantry ATGMs, which cluster munitions and continual pressure via rotation of offensive units against weary defenders should help with substantially. There’s no one success vector, but by continually wearing down the mutually supportive links in the chain the goal is to make it eventually fall apart. The post directly below this one about a lack of Russian counterbattery fire is one (anecdotal) data point reflecting the potential progress of this strategy.

To break down the whole idea of the maneuvering: let's say you have several units that are set to take a forest line next to a hill.   When you're doing things in terms of a planned sequential assault, you're going to perform the assault in distinct phases.  You're going to send a recon force.   If the recon force hits resistance, note the positions, and report to HQ.  Once you get those positions reported, start the artillery bombardment across the area for a predetermined period, across a predetermined section or method.  Once that's complete, send your tanks forwards to supress the enemy.   Once you suppress the defenses in the area, then send your troops forwards to take the area.  And so on...

This is the sort of thinking around Russian-style tactics.   It's easy to pick up and perform for conscripts, because they're being told every step, and all they would have to do is follow the plan.   But if you encounter a problem along the way (i.e., your bombardment didn't hit enough defenders, your tanks are in the wrong place when it's time to go, et al), you're going to encounter problems, some of which may doom your overall plan. 

Sychronized attacks are more in the line of being able to do all of those steps I listed above at roughly the same time.  So artillery artilleries, tanks tank, and infantry infantries at the same time.  It's far less predictable for your opponent - you can't just focus on one threat at a time, or duck until the artillery stops firing and the tanks withdraw, etc.  And it has a greater chance of overwhelming your opponent with way too many things at once.

However, the problem with this approach comes in how much more training it takes to get it to work.  You not only need to train your teams in how to do the jobs and tasks that they will be responsible for, independent of direct commands, but you need to teach them how to react when things don't work as expected, and how every other team involved in the task will perform and react while they're doing their tasking.  

It's expensive, and it takes practice. A LOT of practice.   NATO standard tactics and operational planning has been built over decades between land, sea and air forces,  and the equipment and weapons and their usage has been developed with those approaches in mind.  Ukraine hasn't had the benefit of that training or practice across their entire force, so even though they're receiving or going to receive NATO equipment, they're not going to be able to use it to full intended effectiveness.",1689896680.0,1689896459.0,t3_154gby0,t1_jsslj5i,,2,28,0,28,0,0,

This would be done in such a way so that their strengths can cover each other's weaknesses and while magnifying the effect of their own firepower. 

An example might be commanding a few squads and a couple of tanks. You could send them in separately, but the tanks would be vulnerable to anti-tank weapons at the squad level while the squads you command would be vulnerable to heavy firepower such as a tank. If you employed them together, squads could fan out and secure an area before bringing those big expensive tanks in, while the tanks can punch a hole in the enemy's defensive line.

I believe the author is advising the Ukrainians to employ this sort of strategy, but at a grander scale involving several hundred or thousands. This requires incredible coordination and training to pull off. Furthermore, large expansive minefields would hinder your ability to do that. The whole maneuver can fall apart if the right flank suddenly stalls upon encountering a massive minefield

When he mentions sequential vs synchronized, I believe he means that synchronized is the ideal condition. You are well practiced and can anticipate the movements of your comrades without hesitation as the action unfolds. The speed will take the enemy off guard.

5,000 KIA per month is still huge, particularly since expensive WIA are likely much higher, and I very much hope it remains unsustainable for the Russians. The trouble is: they have a lot of people and a lot of tolerance for suffering and awful dictators.

Where I'm more hopeful is with respect to Russia's artillery and ammo supply, and the logistics of getting it there. Plus morale and incompetence in the upper leadership of the Russian military (their front line morale is low of course, but it is in every war they fight). I'm also resting some hope of their current missile use being unsustainable, allowing Ukraine to eventually move more AA assets to the front.

Worst case scenario, this drags on and on and freezes. Best case scenario, Russia suffers a significant catastrophic collapse soon allowing Ukrainian reserves to move in and push Russia out nearly entirepy. Realistic scenario (that's still maybe on the hopeful side, but I'd like to think remains realistic) is that there is slow and uneven and bloody progress for a few more months or even into next summer before some ""controlled"" retreats start to occur that eventually lead to a collapse or provoke another coup attempt.

>  Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober.

Primarily the problem is just one of the short time between knowing an attack was coming and reacting to it.

In my hypothetical of a bunch of Patriot batteries, even though they share sensor and targeting data (hooray Link 16!) the time to react for all the batteries is still short. You'd likely have batteries firing at incoming missiles that other batteries have a much higher chance of intercepting wasting missiles and possibly even allowing incoming missiles through (if battery A fires at target A, battery B with a better firing position will know and may not engage, meaning the missile fired from battery A might miss and allow it through).

China isn't getting away with what they do because of nukes, but because of economic power (sanctioning or boycotting them isn't really possible for most of the world). 

Russia isn't 'getting away' with much at all, given that its economy has been strangled and a large proportion of its military destroyed. I don't think dictators in other nations are watching this thinking 'Wow Putin can get away with so much due to nuclear threats, we should do that!'. Most nations couldn't withstand the level of economic blockade that Russia is experiencing. RUSSIA can't handle it, they just had a good amount of reserves to burn through and a lack of regard for their future beyond a few years max.

All that said, insufficient confidence by nations due to this fear of escalation has undoubtedly extended the war. Putin is not emboldened but isn't stopped either. It's an unsatisfying middling kind of result, and it's costing Ukrainian (as well as Russian) lives. But the people making the big decisions really do have to weigh up what could cause nuclear apocalypse, and while that chance is very low (hence arming Ukraine so much), it isn't zero, and that's a hell of a nonzero chance to be sitting on.

And yet they allowed crew and passengers to evacuate in time. You can sink ships without doing so, you know?

Do you think it would be called ""unrestricted submarine warfare"" if there were no restrictions before? The Q-Ships were partially concealed as neutral ships which had to be searched for weapons first.

Edit: [Feel free to read up on the great adventures on these Q-Ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baralong_incidents) flying fake US flags to deceive submarines

> U-27 was lying off Nicosian's port quarter and firing into it when Baralong appeared on the scene, flying the ensign of the United States as a false flag. When she was half a mile away, Baralong ran up a signal flag indicating that she was going to rescue Nicosian's crew. Wegener acknowledged the signal, then ordered his men to cease firing, and took U-27 along the port side of Nicosian to intercept Baralong. As the submarine disappeared behind the steamship, Herbert steered Baralong on a parallel course along Nicosian's starboard side.

> Before U-27 came round Nicosian's bow, Baralong hauled down the American flag, hoisted the Royal Navy's White Ensign, and unmasked her guns. As U-27 came into view from behind Nicosian, Baralong began shooting with its three 12-pounder guns at a range of 600 yd (550 m), firing 34 rounds for only a single shot from the submarine. U-27 rolled over and began to sink

> Twelve men survived the sinking of the submarine: the crews of her two deck guns and those who had been on the conning tower. They swam to Nicosian and attempted to join the six-man boarding party by climbing up its hanging lifeboat falls and pilot ladder. Despite his recent orders to take no prisoners from U-boats, Herbert claimed in his report to the Admiralty to have been worried that the German survivors might try to scuttle the steamer as an explanation for why he ordered his men to open fire with small arms, killing all in the water. Wegener is described by some accounts as being shot while trying to swim to the Baralong.

> Herbert then sent Baralong's 12 Royal Marines, commanded by a Corporal Collins, to find the surviving German sailors aboard Nicosian. As they departed, Herbert ordered Collins, ""Take no prisoners."" The Germans were discovered in the engine room and shot on sight.",1689841604.0,1689840897.0,t3_154gby0,t1_jspas64,,4,4,0,4,0,0,
