>Hackers from the Anonymous collective have published extensive data sets from the Russian authority Roskomnadzor. They indicate, among other things, collusion with China.

>The international hacktivist collective Anonymous has carried out a large-scale data breach at the Moscow office of Roskomnadzor, Russia's federal agency for the surveillance of communications, information technology and mass media. As part of Operation Russia (OpRussia), the group, in collaboration with the Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) data transparency collective, released nearly 500 gigabytes of data from the agency's records.

>Anonymous, known for its freedom of information and digital rights campaigners, made the leaked files public, revealing a chilling exchange between Russian and Chinese authorities over state control of internet access and the expression of dissenting opinions. The files, which include call notes, audio recordings, written exchanges and emails, provide a glimpse of intense collaboration between the two countries on digital surveillance and internet censorship.

>According to the published details, Russia has sought advice from China on how to crack access to anonymity tools like Tor and VPN. At the same time, China appears to be asking Russia for assistance on measures to suppress dissent within its borders. This information has raised global concerns about the potential impact on civil liberties and digital privacy.

>The 500 gigabyte files available on the DDoSecrets website reveal how the Russian censorship agency works. This is not the first time Roskomnadzor has faced a leak. Previous releases included the Roskomnadzor and the Russian Censor Files, making this the third major break in the agency's data.

>However, the publication of the data set against the background of cyber wars and hybrid wars should be treated with caution.

In fact, this is what we are seeing in Russia right now – we are seeing their weakness, which we so badly need. The weaker Russia is, and the more its bosses fear mutinies and uprisings, the more they will fear to irritate us, the free world. Russia's weakness will make it safe for others, and its defeat will solve the problem of this war.

It is important not to stop imposing sanctions. The fewer pauses there are, the less Russia will adapt to the pressure on it and the less it will think of ways to circumvent the sanctions. I am grateful that the eleventh sanctions package pays attention to Russia's attempts to circumvent sanctions through third countries, and this attention should be strengthened in the twelfth EU sanctions package.

If solidarity continues to work, if our security and economic cooperation is not broken by artificial and illegal restrictions, if Europe's long-term and principled decisions continue to send signals to the world that Europe believes in peace, then this war will definitely not drag on.

Peace has no alternatives. So, maximum unity in Europe has no alternatives.

I said this while addressing the participants of the European Council meeting. The meeting was attended by leaders of EU member states and European institutions, including President of the European Council Charles Michel, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola.

It's reserved as an emergency move if things start collapsing really badly. If Ukraine makes a significant breakthrough, but Russia stabilizes, they might not bother. Remember after the initially kharkiv breakthrough there was still a month of fighting to get recapture Lyman, but the message was clear Russia's current force wasn't enough to stabilize the line without mobilization. Politically and economically mobilization is very tough on Russia and Putin seems very reluctant to do that, and I can only imagine the recent mutiny has made him more cautious. But the fact is the situation on the Frontline might start falling part to a point Russia mobilizes before we've seen a significant change in territory because things are so dire behind the scenes.

To put it simply Russia is desperate to avoid another mobilization and wants to freeze the conflict as soon as possible to avoid it, but I get the impression their defense is very precarious and if Ukraine is able to deliver a good disruption to it it will just collapse completely without it, so Putin will order another mobilization then.

To quote one of my old American football coaches, ""Sometimes, you're just going to have to run 20 yards to go 3 yards forwards.""  Ukraine's been busy with hitting the Russians in a developing weak spot - their increasingly challenged logistical supply lines.

There's been  pushes all along the line, some for probing defenses, some as feints, others as an actual push for advantageous positions.   They'll encourage counterattacks as much as they can to keep the Russians from settling in, which counters the strengths of defensive fortifications.  All that time, they've been making the Russians supply their units with a shrinking pool of vehicles and burn up ammunition and supplies.    Now with the Ukrainians gaining the ability to reliably hit the supply depots and railway junctions deep behind the lines, the Russians are being forced to burn the candle at both ends to continue.  The strikes on the bridges in Chonhar and the warehouses along the railway lines have been hinting at that particular shaping target.

Now that the distances and quantity of the supplies are getting more difficult to keep up, the Russians will have to decide - hold the defensive lines and continue the bleeding, or fall back to the 2nd defensive lines where the supply situation may not be so bad.  If the Russians stick with the former, the Ukrainians will continue pounding the way they are.   If the Russians opt for the latter though, that's when the Ukrainians will leap in and take advantage of the chaos.

But other than that, there's not much point I can think of.

If Ukraine holds any significant portion of the other bank, a guy with a Zodiac pulling up to a random spot is going to be able to move far more stuff and probably with *lower* human risk, given how noticeable the 200 drone trips are going to be vs 1 trip with the boat at night.",False,1688082596.0,t3_14luiwk,t1_jq1x113,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,14luiwk,jq20lmz,"Drones don't really have that much carrying capacity. Say a drone takes about 90 minutes for a round trip, including loading/offloading and then another 30 minutes to charge. At the most it can carry 3-5kg. So already, anything heavier than 5kg you can't move. Even then their actual range will be limited.

Conceivably, you could split a lot of things in loads smaller than 5kg. But that means a ton of extra work on the sending and receiving end. But say you want to supply a few hundred men across the river, they each need 3-4 liters of water a day, rations, ammunitions, medical supplies, the works. Wouldn't surprise me if you come out to 5-10 tons a day.

Since you can't optimally pack a drone every time, let's assume 4kg on average per round trip. At 10 tons that's 2500 drone trips, at 5 tons it's 1250. One drone can make 12 trips per 24h, but you probably can't send them at night cause you don't have vision. So in summer let's assume 12 hours where you actually can use them. So that means you need 200-400 drones per day to move things. My guess is that most of the drones in operation right now need a human operator at all times and cannot be effectively preprogrammed. They'd need to be given a send/return command at least based on human interaction. 

Those drones will probably also do a very good job at locating where the soldiers are, as they constantly landing/departing from that location. 

So all in all. You need a very high number of drones and operators, you can't move anything that is even a little bit heavy, you need a sizeable logistical operation to pack/unpack and run it all, and you end up signalling your location.

Best guess is that it's not a good idea and only useful for emergency situations and limited goods.

It ends when it ends and not a day sooner. This may be frustrating to hear but it’s the truth. The Ukrainians view this as a fight for their survival and a fight against genocide. They will not sue for peace lightly and could potentially keep the war going for years or even decades depending on what happens in the future. Similarly Putin’s fate is now largely tied to the outcome of the war and it’s hard to imagine a reasonable scenario in which Putin stays in power and leaves all of Ukraine. 

Of course the war cannot continue indefinitely at the current pace and Putin’s hold on power is far from certain. War is inherently extremely unpredictable so I’m hesitant to say how or what the end will look like but eventually wars do end.

Edit [Anders Puck Nielsen made a very good video on the topic that’s pretty short and covers why “peace” isn’t a viable option in the short term](https://youtu.be/7pJ4JIoGnzc) I’d also recommend reading anything from Anne Applebaum on the same topic.

1. Putin moves to freeze the conflict and keep the gains they have. He doesn't care if they all come with an asterisk like Crimea did after it's occupation in 2014,  a long enough time occupying will have the world treat these areas as defacto Russia.

2. Ukraine is able to successfully conduct a drawn out campaign where they restore their full borders. This will take the longest, but with allied nations being happy to supply equipment to make that happen, that's doable. Enormous cost in lives though.

3. We see Russia have enough internal stability issues (coup or revolution), that it has to withdraw significant amounts of troops to shore up things at home no matter who is in power. These withdrawals will compromise fronts, so if things aren't urgent, we may see them withdraw from their least desired areas first.

The Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, has a range of about 190 miles, enough for Ukrainian forces to strike Russian targets far behind the front lines. President Biden hasn’t signed off on the transfer, in part out of concern among U.S. officials that Ukraine could use it to strike Russian territory and escalate the conflict into a wider war with the West.   
Officials said that the matter is pending approval at the highest levels. But officials in the U.S. and Europe have seen signs that previously reluctant quarters of the U.S. government, namely the White House, have come to see an urgent need to bolster Ukraine’s fight in the coming weeks.  
But amid the domestic turmoil in Russia, where over the weekend the founder of the Wagner mercenary force staged an abortive mutiny, U.S. and European officials acknowledged that now might be the time to step on the gas.   
A senior Ukrainian defense official told The Wall Street Journal that Kyiv had received positive signs in recent weeks that the U.S. had come around on the ATACMS system. Ukrainian officials have argued that the long-range missiles are needed, in part, to strike into Crimea, the peninsula occupied by Russia that Russian forces are using as a base to launch Iranian-made drones, according to public statements by the U.S. and its European allies.

Law-based democracies that actually try to combat their own corruption.

Governments that allow businesses to operate in a rational manner without needing to pay brutal protection rackets.

World-leading higher-education institutions.

Seems to me that some form of tangible security guarantee must be extended. I could imagine a type of ""defense by denial"" agreement.

Defense by Denial, as far as I understand it, discourages (as opposed to punishes) an enemy by making achievement of its goals impossible. What does Russia want? A pliant and corrupt Ukraine, but it'll settle for a paralyzed Ukraine that's not friendly but can still be manipulated.

How can this denial be achieved?

1. Given the recently disclosed failure of Ukraine's indigenous missile program, help them create the missiles they seek. This way when the ships sink in Sevastopol, it's not ""Made in the USA."" Minor distinction but makes all the difference in the public sphere. Ukraine will get there on their own, so might as well help them bridge the gap now.
2. Offer to secure their northern border with Belarus. There's a constant fear of invasion by Belarus (and now Wagner) and Ukraine is dedicating forces there. Given the minimal risk of a conflict in the north a NATO ""peace keeping"" force could deploy to prevent a spread of the conflict. Ukraine can then move their forces and equipment south and east.
3. Given #2, it's unlikely Russia would attack a NATO force that's acting in a passive peace keeping capacity, no matter how much it pissed Russia off. This will open the door to more troops taking up stations in western Ukraine (boiling the frog.)

I'm not saying I expect these things to happen, or anything of that sort, but these are certainly actions that could be taken that will deny Russia's ability to achieve its stated goals. Ukraine with indigenous, powerful, long-range missiles, a sudden large contingent of its own forces freed up to fight, and a NATO peace keeping force along its norther border. At the *very* least that puts everything west of the Dnipro River out of Russia's reach at best we'll see major gains by Ukraine within the year.

For Russia, they need to hold the city for morale purposes, but ultimately the previous benefits are all destroyed, so Russia is only trying to take it for the media headlines and propaganda. So why is Ukraine willing to spend resources on it? Mostly because they’re outkilling the Russians 3:1 (and are in a good ratio for equipment losses too). The US and allies all wanted Ukraine to abandon the city because they were worried that the lives and resources lost on the Ukraine side are higher quality, as you can basically see the kill ratio as 3 untrained Wagner prisoners for 1 battle trained Ukrainian Soldier, but Ukraine insisted that the ratio was still good enough so here we are.

d6c9cf6f939ed0fd244bdea427fe2396,14luiwk,jpyjlwz,"Think about it this way: if you build your system to maximize efficiency (whether you accomplish that through free market capitalism or government centralization), you do that by removing *redundancy.* If you want a system to be *robust,* you need lots of slack that can be repurposed in the event of a shortfall. 

Example: The government wants to buy 10,000 widgets every couple years or so, as cheaply as possible. They have the top three corporations with the necessary widget-stamping machines, and the top two other companies with the technical expertise to convert their fidget-stamping machines into widget-stamping machines, all compete in a bidding war. The two fidget-stamping companies bow out early; it's too costly to convert. One or two of the three widget-stamping companies eventually drops out after a few rounds of bidding; they convert their stampers to making fidgets, if they can. Repeat this process dozens or hundreds of times over the course of decades, and eventually there's only two companies left... assuming that anyone's bothered to keep them both in the business by alternating occasionally. More likely, there's just one.

So now there's one or two widget-stamping companies left in the entire country, and they've pared themselves down to the bare necessities. They each have exactly one widget-stamping expert, and exactly enough stampers to make 10,000 widgets a year. The fidget-stamping companies have ceased to exist, too, because fidgets got replaced with digits twenty years ago, and they use a completely different production process. It's a nice, efficient system, where the cost per widget is minimized (as long as there's no monopolistic industry capture and exploitation happening... among other potential problems. But we'll keep it simple for now).

Suddenly, there's a war on! Now the military needs *two million* widgets a year. There simply aren't enough widget-stamping machines to do it; the fidget-stampers were tossed in a junkyard a decade ago, and even if they were still around the expertise to convert them has retrained, or is long retired, if not dead. Suddenly, a ton of institutional knowledge and physical infrastructure has to be re-built, and no matter how good your process documentation is, no matter how much money you spend, it's going to take time; maybe years. Potentially *decades* if the entire supply chain right down to the metals have been outsourced, say, to your enemy in this war.

With highly sensitive (both in the technological and political senses of the word) equipment like guided munitions, all these problems are multiplied across a dozen different disciplines and industries, or more. It was bad enough back in World War 2; the only reason the US came out ahead in the production game then was a combination of foresight on the part of some military and economic planners in government, a boatload of government spending well before the start of the war, and the relative simplicity of all the materiel being produced. The disparity between consumer goods and military equipment is more vast today than it's ever been before.",1688017507.0,1688017208.0,t3_14luiwk,t1_jpygo9x,,3,37,0,37,1,0,

Ukraine is estimated to be using about 155K rounds of this ammo type per month and says that they would be using over 350K rounds per month if it had enough supplies.  

The U.S., over the first year of the war was producing roughly 14K rounds of this type of ammo per month (It's currently producing about 24K/month and is in the process of expanding production to 85K/month over the next couple of years.)  Oh, it seems like the U.S. are completely unprepared for an artillery fight, right?  Oh, they got too used to using their air power and ship-based cruise missiles that they neglected good ole' fashioned artillery?  Wrong.  The U.S. had over 8 million of these rounds sitting in storage (They've already supplied Ukraine with close to 2 million).  They have more than enough to keep the U.S. military supplied for the length of time it will take production to ramp up, and that's on top of their air power and ship-based cruise missiles.  What they don't have is enough to keep the U.S. military supplied while simultaneously keeping Ukraine supplied as it fights against the 2nd biggest military in the world in an artillery fight.

And can you blame them?  Can you imagine those Congressional hearings as some Pentagon official tells them that they want not only enough equipment and munitions to supply the U.S. military for years as it fights two wars simultaneously, but enough extra above that to defeat Russia just in case we want to outfit a different country's military?",1688035877.0,1688035489.0,t3_14luiwk,t1_jpz4n5a,,4,4,0,4,0,0,

Russia taking Bakhmut  doesn't threaten any other position.  Thus, when Russia is attacking it doesn't hold any strategic value.

Cities are the only fortresses that are any good to modern armies.  The bigger the city, the better the fortress.  The ideal situation, if capable, is to bypass the cities.

For the Russians, they take Bakhmut, and they are back to square one when approaching Chasiv Yar.  In basically the exact same tactical situation they were in attacking Bakhmut.

For Ukraine, advancing out of Bakhmut means they don't have to directly assault Donetsk City or Horikliva.  Much bigger cities, and thus better fortresses, then Bakhmut.

As to the quality of that road out of Bakhmut?  Well it's big enough to make the map.  For truly poor quality roads, though, a competent modern fighting force, which the Ukrainians certainly are, can improve a captured road as they advance.

And the Russians I know don't support the war although they all left Russia years ago so that certainly could be the reason for their opinion, then again I have heard accounts that a lot of expat Russian's still support the war.

> Putin's arsenal will out live him, and when I see a homicidal maniac with his band of pardoned prisoners taking over military facilities..... I think ""how does this affect the war?"". That's not unreasonable.

Thats not what your posts were. Your posts were “what Wagner stole nukes! 

And they can take control of the nukes. They’re useless without a way to use them. 

> You should try reasoning with me instead of telling me to shut up. I'm not an idiot or fearmongerer. 


People tried to reason with you and you ignored everything they said and continued to push the “oh no. What if Wagner got nukes and uses them” bullshit. That’s fear mongering. 

> I just have a different view on what to do with the fear we all feel.

It’s not a fear we all feel. That’s just you. Everyone else looks at the situation logically and understands that no one is going to use a nuke for any reason. Any use of any type of nuclear weapon would result in a swift and incredible response from the world. Even the few countries Russia sees as allies would shut them off from the world. 

Using a nuke is the one taboo you don’t break.",1688048204.0,1688047949.0,t3_14luiwk,t1_jpzqxci,,7,2,0,2,0,0,
