- Putin had stated that his primary asks have not been met and they will stick to their plan unless the asks are met. 

- Scholz suggested that for now Ukraine cannot really join nato and he hopes that neither he nor Putin in their leadership terms would have to deal with it.

D) No independent source confirming substantial withdrawals.

E) Russian media spreading disinformation to keep everyone guessing.

\- Claims Russia is withdrawing (Russia)  
\- Claims Russia is reinforcing (NATO, Europe)  
\- An IED allegedly discovered in a separatist region being blamed on pro-Ukraine supporters (TASS; Russian state media)

The whole this was so unnecessarily dramatic, trying to cry and everything. I'm getting deja vu from the time Russian media claimed a 3 yo was crucified in Ukraine back in 2014.

Almost three decades ago, an event took place, the echoes of which are shaking the world right now. Five nuclear powers have pledged to Ukraine to respect its independence and territorial integrity. The provision of security guarantees (and these exact words were in the title of the Budapest Memorandum, under which the superpowers signed) became a condition for Ukraine's voluntary renunciation of its nuclear missile capabilities. At the time, it was third in the world, surpassing the potential of France, Britain and China.

Now Ukraine can remember the solemn promises of the ""big four"" (we were grateful that China joined the memorandum) only as a mockery. Back in 2014, Russia destroyed our territorial integrity by occupying Crimea and part of Donbass. Today, the threat of further military invasion is directed at Ukraine from three sides. We are facing the prospect of an economic blockade - energy from the north, sea blockade from the south. Meanwhile, the inadmissibility of economic pressure on Ukraine was also noted as one of the points of the Budapest Memorandum.

What do we hear in response to such actions from those parties to the agreement, for whose protection and whose determination we should count? Only appeals to their citizens and diplomats to flee dangerous Ukraine as soon as possible. Only terrible warnings of invasion, both today and tomorrow, which have already caused great damage to our economy and sow panic among the population.

Only strict warnings to the aggressor that he will pay some ""price"" (which, however, will not include ""North Stream-2"" and SWIFT).

And that's all?

When the great powers signed an agreement with Ukraine in 1994, they actually said: we do not want you to be equal to us. We want to maintain our monopoly. But we offer you our real support in exchange for real protection. Here is our word to you - the honest word of the strong.

We then believed that word, although in the same 94th year one of the signatories of the Budapest Memorandum in a private conversation sadly warned: you are being fooled.

Today is a crucial moment when it is still possible to prove that the Budapest Memorandum was not a simple deception. That the strong can be honest and brave. That strength is not only in the ability to threaten those who are weaker, but also in the ability to keep one's word.

So, prove your true strength. Really, really help those who once believed in you. Finally, take the steps that can stop the aggressor, not strengthen his belief in impunity. Finally, say the words that will make him think instead of sneering.

If we lose today, there will be no more Budapest Memorandums. No country that can acquire nuclear weapons will renounce them under any circumstances. So at stake now is not only the fate of Ukraine, but your world authority. At stake is the future of world security.

Realize this. And have the strength to be responsible and courageous!

It gives an undeniable edge to NATO in any conflict that occurs anytime in the future. Russia will not and can not let this happen. So what do they do? They puff up. Mass troops on the border so Ukraine knows what’s gonna happen if they fuck around and try to join up with the rest of Europe. Kind of a heavy handed tactic but it has its uses and it’s clearly viable. So we have a massive troop buildup around Ukraine. NATO tells Russia what they’re going to do if Russia invades ie sanctions, “we’ll destroy the ruble”, move troops and armaments closer to Russia, etc which is the exact thing that Putin did not want to happen in the beginning and it’s backed him into a corner. If Putin doesn’t invade, he gains nothing BUT loses numerous things...ie all the resources already poured into troop buildup, authority and bargaining power with the west, and also opens up a doorway for Ukraine to frantically try to join nato as fast as possible. If he invades, he gains the security he was looking for but at the cost of financial ruin for his country. Would just like to add that he’s already stated he would interpret the sanctions being discussed as an act of war. I think the possibility of him backing down at this point is about 50/50 or 40/60.

It’s a lose lose situation for him. 

Now let’s switch views for a second. 

Let’s take the stance of NATO. Russia invades and NATO sanctions the ever living fuck out of them. Russia declares war. It’s not a war they can win but it will cripple the global economy and wreak devastation world wide. Clearly not a good option. 

Option number two: Russia invades and NATO does nothing. That leaves Russia right next to Romania and Poland which are NATO countries, you don’t want those three very close to each other. I imagine Poland and Romania (and also turkey) would start to get very jittery at that point. Russia gains access to the entirety of the Black Sea almost. They gain access to Ukraine’s industrial work force, supply lines, and factories which is very important piece to the rest of Europe believe it or not. They force nato to completely restructure all existing troop deployments  to account for the added threat, and most importantly it sends a signal to China that this type of behavior is okay. Clearly not a good option either

Option Number 3. Russia and NATO compromise and invasion doesn’t take place. The best option. It pushes back the inevitable conflict that is going to take place between Russia and NATO at some point. Best for everyone currently but likely to breed more resentment as one side is going to feel like they got shafted no matter what is decided. I would like to say this is what will occur but I am no longer sure to be completely honest.

I don’t think nuclear weapons will factor into this. Nor do I think they ever will. You’d have to be suicidal. Then again some mofos are really willing to blow the whole world up if they are losing so idk. Hope not.

So from what I’ve read, Ukraine can’t join NATO because if they do, the border conflict clause will be triggered due to Crimea. What’s stopping Ukraine from giving up Crimea to Russia and the world acknowledging it as part of Russia? Crimea’s population is mostly Russian anyways. If Ukraine does this, wouldn’t that mean they no longer have a border conflict (because they gave up on Crimea) and they would be free to join NATO without threat of Putin deploying nukes? Is giving up Crimea worth joining NATO? Or am I missing something else in regards to Putin and his conditions to deploy nukes?

Downvote away because again, I’m extremely ignorant on this topic so if I said anything dumb I probably deserve to be downvoted 😅 But I would appreciate an answer to my question so I can further my understanding on this topic. Thanks!",1644924575.0,1644924350.0,t3_ssn7ic,t3_ssn7ic,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

How convenient- right when Russia says troops are withdrawing.

A) Russia says troops are withdrawing 

B) then a convenient Ukrainian gov terrorist plot is uncovered in Luhansk 

C) then Putin says genocide is occurring in the Donbas

D) then reports of heavy artillery fire begin

This could be absolutely *not* routine. If it’s a couple pot shots from D-30 towed artillery, sure. If it’s an intense barrage involving D-30s and bigger sparty then it could be far more serious.

I have many relatives who are Ukrainian (so the potential for more conflict hits really close to home for me) and some of them are currently serving in the Ukrainian Armed Forces - their stories about the current state of morale and professionalism in the Army doesn’t leave me with many positive thoughts about how effectively Ukraine would be able to defend themselves. The best hope the West has to counter a Russian invasion is providing economic aid to Ukraine, as a reinvigorated economy would be the best thing the nation can hope for right now to aid morale. My relatives say that the mood in Ukraine is pretty calm as very little has changed in the past few years in terms of the conflict, but it’s impossible for anyone here to predict the future so the best we can do is hope and pray that the current set of international discussions don’t fall through and that some form of peace agreement can be guaranteed.",False,1644946636.0,t3_ssn7ic,t3_ssn7ic,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

The most likely explanation is that the threat of war was intended to create a major issue, so that the planned ""independence""/annexation of the rebel-controlled regions in eastern Ukraine would seem like de-escalation.

Meanwhile, with the threat of war still fresh in people's minds, much of the west will be reluctant to impose major sanctions for the ""limited"" actions by Russia. (with many people conveniently ignoring that it's yet another case of Russia violating the territorial integrity of one of its neighbors)

Such a tactic gives Putin a cheap win to bolster his support in Russia, while also taking back some of the lands he considers to be ""historically Russian.""

It's a dangerous game, though, as he's effectively practicing extreme brinkmanship to achieve his goals. And while that might work out, it also comes with the risk of unintended escalation -- endangering thousands or even millions of lives.

Plus, Ukraine has sizeable army.

We're talking in the hundreds for Ukraine. However, while the aircraft are much weaker for Ukraine, that actually have some upgraded tanks that are better than Russia's by a significant amount -but the upgraded ones are only around 60-ish. The Ukrainian aircraft are likely to be moved west, out of the theater of combat, to avoid being shot down needlessly. Drone warfare is likely to be one sided because of Russia's electronic warfare / jamming capabilities. 

The more important things outside of numbers are all of the anti-tank and anti-air missile systems given/sold to Ukraine recently, which are very sophisticated and effective, but can be used in guerilla warfare and insurgency because they don't require a vehicle or installation to operate. Obviously Ukraine can move to a guerilla warfare or insurgency strategy very naturally, and that would be extremely painful for Russia in both short and long term.

the actual reason is their failing economy, and nostalgic, deranged, aging leaders, also their kind of salty about the whole their puppet being ousted by a revolution and the collapse of the Ussr way earlier than that.

also warm water ports that will be damaged/destroyed instead of actually investing into their economy and building one in their actual land, they say it's impossible, but it's false, many smaller nations with less manpower, resources, and wealth take on much larger engineering projects, multiple at a time. also farmland, instead of improving their farming practices and equipment and investing in new gmo crops, pesticides, and fertilizers, which are both the cheaper and easier option, and even the act building them is economically enriching.

afaik many of Ukraine's natural resources have been extracted over the years, so it us unlikely they invading for those.

also to them, meaning their government ""winning a war"" is supposed to ""revitalize the peoples spirits"" instead of you know, actually giving people reasons to be happy and produce/build stuff.

If Ukraine wants to hurt Russia, they need to go hard on scorched earth tactics, as under Russia's air support, artillery, tank hordes, drones, and loitering munitions, they wont last long, look up footage of Armenia vs Azerbaijan and you will see how hard it is to fight against these.

and it's not like any nato support is giving them any effective weapons, infantry with helmets, stingers and javelins wont get a chance to use them for the most part. munitions depots, aircraft, and tanks probably wont last a day, maybe two. and even if any nation somehow got the balls, effort, and resources to provide them, even large quantities advanced ciws, cram, aam's wont help them. even so, it's probably going to be bloody and prolonged. but Russia may just do the smart move and push their way to a natural border like a river and halt, taking much of Ukraine's heartlands, and biting away piece by piece over the next 20-40 years, a large portion of the northwest will be occupied for Belarus, and portions of the southwest may become part of that soviet loving nation that starts of a t that i cant remember.",1644895583.0,1644895344.0,t3_ssn7ic,t1_hwzlc7z,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

It would definitely start devastating economic sanctions and could draw NATO into a war with Russia and who exactly wants that?

I think what will happen will be rather similar to what happened in 2008 in Georgia when Russia invaded South Ossetia.

IF things go like they did in 2008 in Georgia, some civilians will get caught in the crossfire as soldiers start firing at other soldiers.

Russo-Georgia war started in 1st of August in 2008, escalated into a full land, sea and air invasion by Russia on the 8th and ended on the 12th to a ceasefire after they had captured the capital of South Ossetia.

Depending on sources 162 to 224 civilians were killed and 227-547 civilians wounded. Meanwhile ~350 soldiers killed in action, ~1500 wounded, 5 missing and 90 captured.

USA told it's partner countries, that they have details on Russian plans, and an attack could happen as early as on the 16th. According to the US intelligence, the likely window for an attack is between the 16th until the end of the Olympic games. It doesn't mean it will happen, it also doesn't mean it will happen in that time frame necessarily.

From open source intelligence (TikTok/Twitter/VK videos, satellite images) it is clearly visible, that Russia is in a position to attack any moment now. A lot of their military is within a 20-30km radius of the Ukrainian border.

So it can happen, Russia is in position and could attack any time, but it's unclear whether they will.

>- Russia is apparently retreating their troops

That's what Russian officials claimed a few hours ago. They claimed that Russia is moving **some** of their units back to their permanent location. We have no proof of it as of now, and we don't know how many (if true) of their units they are moving.

>- Apparently they're in attack mode

As explained earlier, Russian units are near the border, with some units deployed in an attacking position. It doesn't mean they are preparing to attack, however it does mean, that they **could** attack at any time if they wanted.

If in the years after world War 2 we've been in a relative peace in the world its only thanks to the efforts put in from the USA and a bunch of other progressive nations. Putin is trying to be the strong man without anything to back it up. Nato is not threatening the security of Russia.  Rather, if in the 90s russia had taken the right steps towards democracy it could be in nato and even in the eu. Like other former soviet republics have done. I mean that every nation can profit in this system, even russia with all its land and resources. The Ukrainians have the right to be in whatever position they please. If they want to try joining nato and eu it's their right of self determination. Russia is just being petty at this point. The contest for the world power has already been won by usa and in the future maybe china. Unfortunately russia is not the world power it used to be.

However it would be naive to put the blame solely on your country and capitalism for that matter. Ironically, it's the same capitalism that has helped China & Russia become where we are today. However that doesn't mean one is reign superior to another. Each has their strength and weakness. Insofar, if we give China and Russia time, history shows that they are likely to start to rot, as does any country, empire, which ever you may wish to call it.

Apart from all this, though not American, I rather have America be the superpower than any country. Period. The lesser of all evils. 

Furthermore, I believe that as America realizes its predicament and its leading edge getting smaller, they will rebound from this harder than ever. Ie. The space race with the former USSR that quickly pushed education and science. Newsflash. Some of this is already happening. 

Funny enough, its the same consumerism that could perhaps be the solution. Ie. Tesla, SpaceX. As the ESG will become better and closer to its vision, the globe will shift towards a better sustainable future. 

There has never been another form of government such as democracy that has brought the innovations and prosperity which we so take for granted today. Albeit many of these advancements were discovered from darker times such as war. 

Commerce, this consumerism, and technology is what will connect us and hopefully for a better united future for all of humanity. Ie. Internet.

That doesn't mean there won't be obstacles along the way. Such as the situation in Ukraine, Taiwan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the uighars, Myanmar etc.

Russia has a major numerical and material advantage on paper, and overwhelming superiority in aircraft, and the ability to invade on two fronts thanks to Belarus, but there really hasn't been an information age ground war on the scale that this one would be. Ukraine has ~200k regular troops and up to a million reservists, and access to some pretty significant and potentially game changing tech for a defensive battle, specifically Javelins/LAWs/Stingers. In terms of the sheer size of Ukraine both in surface area and population, it is a far different proposition to a minnow like Chechnya.

Some of the major uncertainties

- what actually are Russia's war aims? Eg, what amounts for a 'win' for them? Are they trying to annex more of the east, depose the government, take and hold the entire country by military force, what?

- how hard and how well will the Ukrainian army/population fight? Will they melt in 24 hours Afghani army style, turn on the government, or conduct a professional resistance and fall back to Lviv, or fight the last man and then turn to guerrilla warfare? 

- how well will the russian army fight?. They look like they are planning for a coordinated, multi front invasion with air support and armor a la desert storm. Do they have enough well trained units to do that? Do they have the technical competence and training to pull it off? 

- are their sufficient pro-Russian puppets available to mount a coup/undermine military resistance?

- how will the world and Europe react to the huge amount of smartphone vision of the ugly realities of war? We are never going to have seen anything quite like this.

- what will then Ukrainian leadership do when the shooting starts? Will they resist, flee, flip, try to negotiate, what?

- what level of assistance will NATO states offer to Ukrainian units in terms of resupply, providing assistance to partisans, keeping additional units moving, etc. What will they do if, for example, in a scenario where Ukraine collapses, Ukrainian units try to withdraw across its western borders into the adjoining states. Hell, what will russia do in that scenario? 

- What role will satellite information play and how helpful/and willing to help, will western countries be in that regard? Bear in mind that a huge amount of American conventional military dominance simply comes from having better visibility and information about what's happening in a conventional war than the enemy- if they have effective liaison with Ukrainian commanders, which would be very hard to do with no planning, that changes a lot of things. Also bear in mind that as essentially a huge flat plain, Ukraine is going to be a highly visible battle field for satellites.

The last point is to me the most fascinating but also potentially the most dangerous point in terms of the conflict spiralling. We've never really seen a situation where a defensive, weaker military might have access to high quality real time satellite intelligence, and it could be a major game changer. But its also potentially very inflammatory, because in a scenario where Ukraine fights hard,  the US will absolutely have the capacity to directly cause the deaths of russian soldiers without ever firing a shot- if they are willing and able to pass high quality satellite information to where it is needed. If they are able to, eg, tell the commander of a well equipped Ukrainian infantry platoon: 'there are six tanks and two trucks full of infantry heading down a road to town X,  based on their current road speed they will pass within 100 metres of deserted apartment block Y in around 2 hrs time.'- that is going to get russians killed just as surely as a tomahawk missile from a US warship. The question then becomes, what does Russia do about that if they know its happening? Would they try and blind or disable US satellites?

0f53b98321ee22416df55e0b804874c1,ssn7ic,hwzm3km,"3 weeks ago, there was nearly a coup in Kazakhstan. At its peak, the president sent the military to quell protesters, and once they arrived, 40% of the Kazakhstan military joined sides with the protesters and trained their weapons on their fellow comrades. 

Russia was able to successfully block the coup, by sending in literal paratroopers from the sky. But just because the coup was prevented doesn't mean its all in the past. 

40%. 40%, 3 weeks ago.

6 weeks ago, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan were on the verge of a massive military conflict and had already shot at and wounded both soldiers and civilians on both sides. Russia successfully mediated the tempest but the two nations are incredibly icy to one another. That was 6 weeks ago.

Russia can't afford to lose ANY of these puppet states or they all fall like dominos. They need to maintain a strong troop, and diplomatic presence, in all 3 nations. 

Not to mention the ongoing threat from the Chechens

After the successful use of the aircraft the Ukrainian Navy had ordered a separate order of 6 additional Bayraktar TB2s, delivered in 2020 according to navy officials. Meanwhile, Turkish and Ukrainian officials have announced the establishment of a joint venture to produce 48 additional Bayraktar TB2s in Ukraine. During a Russian military buildup in Crimea and near Ukraine's borders, a Bayraktar TB2 conducted a reconnaissance flight over the Donbas region on 9 April 2021.

The 2020 war between Azeris and Armenia was a show for air power this decade. Not many people paid attention. Russia was invoked and did. So Azeris we’re better equipped. Day one they launched ground attack with armor. They got stomped out. After a few days they pulled back. They had TONS of drones from Turkey. The Drones didn’t have Armenian aircraft to deal with (russia basically won’t either as Ukraine has about 100 against planes). They spent about 7-10 days hunting and killing all AA batteries Armenia brought in. They didn’t risk manned aircraft. Losing drones is no big deal. Then they were good to go and had free flight. They spent a month slamming everything on the ground. They would ruin entire trenches. They also used drone swarms which was new. Anyways so many Armenia troops died without firing a shot or even getting to the front. Finally Azeris started about a two week long renewed ground offensive. They rolled the enemy in the two prongs they sent. Armenia has no supplies, limited vehicles, limited artillery, and no armor left to fight against the enemy. Armenian fought well anyways, causing a lot of enemy casualties but they couldn’t win. Air power decides it. 

Before anyone says Ukraine is better than Armenia, I’m not arguing that. That’s true. But the air disparity is about the same as the 2020 war. One side is about 99% stronger in the air. 

This is also what USA did to Iraq. Hammered them. But they didn’t have unmanned drones with the tech and numbers that people do today. 

I confess I’m not sure what Ukraine air defense batteries are or in what numbers, but I’m confident it’s not enough to stop Russia in a meaningful way. They would needs hundreds of batteries since they have no Air Force basically.",False,1644959393.0,t3_ssn7ic,t1_hx26z2t,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

In both cases, you had a massive military buildup on the borders of a nation that outclassed local forces by an order of magnitude and was capable of rolling over the defending nation.

Basically, the only hope that Ukraine has is that they can offer something that's sufficient for Putin to call off his invasion. But it's not entirely clear what that might be. Even if Saddam had complied with the coalition's demands in 2003, it's likely that foreign troops would have moved into Iraq in any case, to secure the transition of power.

It's pretty unlikely that portable antitank weapons are going to do much good against a Russian invasion given their tactics. If they proved a real threat, the Russians would just siege the Ukrainian cities where they were present like the US-led coalition did in the Second Battle of Falluja or Russia did to Grozny. And they wouldn't be as polite about it as the US Marines were when they assaulted Fallujah. They'd use thermobaric weapons to level entire grid squares of civilian cities if necessary to ensure that there were no significant fortifications before moving in their heavy armor. 

You can't do much with ATGMs if the opposing forces keeps its heavy armor and mechanized artillery in a defensible position with standoff range and then sends in probing infantry attacks to your fortified areas to call down air strikes and thermobaric rockets on where you've set up your ATGMs and other fortified defenses.",False,1644897852.0,t3_ssn7ic,t1_hwzrxr0,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

But there is significant evidence (from a federal commission as well as from investigative journalists) that collaborate the fact that, under Putin, Russian bots have had significant impacts in spreading misinformation that is designed to encourage domestic strife.

Personally, I think Putin is playing chess. He sees our weaknesses in education & media independence. By no means do I think that Putin is a Grand Master at the game of politics, but i do think he knows how likely the American public is to punish their politicians for playing the game as he has defined. Whoever controls the US response must consider the stance of their constituency much more than than the response of a Russian politician under Putin has to.

(I'm left of Bernie, so what I've said is definitely biased toward that fact)

Edit: I lost my own point in my ramble. The point that I missed addressing:  washing your hands of concern in the battle between bad versus evil makes you on the side of evil.

This event took place in the aftermath of the Revolution of Dignity and is part of the wider Russo-Ukrainian conflict. On 22–23 February 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin convened an all-night meeting with security service chiefs to discuss the extrication of the deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych.

I used to trust the BBC but it seems to be all over the shop with reporter's personal bias or undertones of general bias throughout. Worse still, their primary driver seems to now be ""elongation of content"" so their consistency of reporting is difficult to gauge - anything that can be drawn out to engage more is sensationalised to fill more content (to fill their 24hr dross channel) and attract more views, and approach which is in turn leaking out and filling their other outlets.

The FT used to be great as it was financial reporting, backed up by almost-zero bias facts and zero opinion. This however seems to have moved as they've developed their own agendas they're trying to push.

Saddest for me was the Metro which when it started in \~2001 (general availability) was as close to raw news aimed at getting information to every level of society without bias. That's now become a redtop clone sensationalist mess more akin to ""The National Enquirer"" than a real newspaper.

That was the story a few days ago.

My expectation is that they won't. Doing so would only serve to confirm US intelligence is accurate and bolster trust in US sources.

It would be a useful propaganda tool, especially to continue drumming up right wing support for Russia in the US.

Keeping troops at the border for weeks with the constant threat of invasion is going to hurt Ukraine economically and reasons can be found later to justify an invasion like claiming Ukraine attacked first or executing a false flag.

However, hypothetical NATO nukes in Ukraine, if launched on, for example, Moscow, would allow for very little response time to intercept/evacuate/retaliate. In an extreme case, being able to strike first without giving your opponent time to fire back would undercut the shaky peace between nuclear powers afforded by MAD.   
To the second question: I can’t begin to guess at what Putin&Co are actually thinking. But his number one priority at all times is holding on to power, and one of the pillars he’s standing on is making sure the public doesn’t have any alternatives, both to his person and to what passes for his ideological platform. This has been achieved through repressions against potential opponents (i.e. Navalny), heavy government control of mass media and persecuting independent sources, and, most importantly for an average citizen, pushing the idea  that Putin is responsible for the living standards that drastically rose since the 1990s. If a neighbouring, culturally and eth*n*ically close country (so not Baltics and Estonia) manages to get rid of the local autocrat and not fall into chaos, but improve and grow richer, then this pillar may crumble.

1) We're watching military aircraft that are choosing to run around with a transponder turned on. Commercial aviation has to use a transponder but the military *should* but whether they do or not is another matter. As I mentioned in another comment, you bet your ass the Russians are damn aware where the US aircraft are, transponder or otherwise, and likewise the Americans about the Russians. To do this means they want to be seen, want to be tracked and are basically highlighting where they are and what they're up to for the rest of us, whomever we may be.

2) The flight patterns on some are worthless. Yes, there's a big American presence in North Germany and their stuff is going to move around there routinely. In the case of the RC-135 however it's a big and very clever reconnaissance bird, constantly swallowing everything it comes near such as radio chatter, command and control stuff and anything it can ""see"". For me watching their flight plans is them hammering home the current rhetoric of the US government in that they're around but not looking to be involved. They are however gathering intel to try to understand i*f* the Russians are trying anything, and, if they do, *what* that initial process would look like.

I've found the patterns of the aforementioned 135 fascinating particularly as yesterday it spent hours circling ""international airspace"" off the bottom of Ukraine as if to cite ""we're nearby but we're not interfering"". Today, in advance of the latest escalation/de-escalation (pending how you look at the last few hours) it was doing laps of Ukraine itself, albeit West of the river, as if to say ""we're now invited to be here, but we're not coming to an area that would really provoke you"" and evidently after better intel at the same time. 

Separately occasionally we're seeing Russian transport and so on float about around the area, but more interestingly choosing to turn off their transponders at key points aiming to create a little more confusion and take up people's time debating where they were headed and why they turned off.

For me it's fascinating anyway and a big part of trying to pull apart different attitudes and peek through the posturing, vitriol and propaganda, and the different games each side is playing.",False,1644942620.0,t3_ssn7ic,t1_hx1quj5,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Disclosures aside, I am interested in your perspective regarding the situation being defensive on the Russian part. The Russian annexation of Crimea was ultimately the result of a Russian-backed armed group defrauding an otherwise democratic election, yeah?

It's hardly fair to say that Crimea was an isolated event when the entire annexation was the result of political violence & a lack of international motivation and/or concern to correct the situation. If democracy can be undermined by ""well, that isn't technically against the ol' international rulebook"", then that means we are potentially facing another appeasement period, or we say ""No, those people don't want to belong to you"".

In 2014, the bully who lives in a house called a Kremlin sat down in a place called Crimea and said, ""this is mine now!""  The bully is really bad at sharing, but really good at making excuses.  Every time someone asked him to leave Crimea and go home, he had a new excuse ready.  People got tired of him and left him alone.

At the same time, some of the bully's friends decided to sit down nearby places called Donetsk and Luhansk.  People were mad and told the bully to make his friends go away.  The bully said, ""those aren't my friends.  They can do what they want.""  So those people who were totally the bully's friends continued doing what they wanted.  Eventually, some people in Donetsk said, ""This is our place now!  We hate you, Papa Ukraine!""  Some people in Luhansk said, ""Yeah, this is our place now!  We're with Donetsk... but totally separate and definitely independent and not being influenced by the bully or his friends!""  So, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic were born.

None of the important people in the world really listened to them though, so they've spent the last few years playing alone in their own sandboxes, occasionally blowing things up and generally being bad.  Papa Ukraine really wants to punish the little DPR and LPR terrors, but is afraid of hurting them and is also afraid of what the bully next door might do.

Now, the bully is an important person in the world, so if the bully listens to the DPR and LPR and says something like, ""Yes, that is your land.  I hate Papa Ukraine, too!  You can do what you want, so why don't you join me and be my friend?""  Then Papa Ukraine is in a very difficult position, and so are the rest of the important people in the world for that matter.


**Back to the 12 year old version:**
Basically, when Russia took Crimea in 2014, some people declared the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to be independent from Ukraine as well.  Until this point, that independence has only been officially recognized by each other.  Ukraine considers both the DPR and LPR as terrorist organizations.  If Russia decides to recognize those independence claims as legitimate, whatever 'government' is set up in those places could just be like ""Yo, we're gonna join Russia.

Fighting them both at the same time is unavoidable. Their ideologies, agendas, and allies align.

Why shouldn’t we defend Ukraine? Would you prefer the harsh, martial authoritarianism of the East to the soft, economic authoritarianism of Western democracy? I prefer the latter because I’m a double minority and neither the worlds up-and-coming superpower nor its attack dog are friendly to either of the things I am. The West, however, is.

So, where does the expansion stop? Does it stop at Georgia? Does it stop at Crimea? Does it stop after Ukraine? Does it stop when the Soviet union is “reunified“? 
If the Soviet union is allowed to reunify, why should it stop at the old border? Why? What does appeasement really win us in the long run?

Is the East going to be any kinder to the developing world? Are they going to be any friendlier to the environment? Based on both Russia and China’s climate accelerationism… No. Hell, I’m sure that a warmed earth would make a lot more arable land for either one of the two main antagonistic nations. I think they’re banking on Siberia having a more Wisconsin-like winter.

,ssn7ic,hwzb3uc,"It's kind of a difficult question, because while there is plenty of military history, not much of it is applicable because the way we fight wars has changed pretty significantly. Up until a bit before the turn of the 20th century we didn't have these massive sprawling conflicts lined up on borders. It was more like a few armies wandering around trying to avoid or run into each other.

Way back when, some king or whatever would call up his armies and march off to war. Sometimes they would get what they want and go home. Sometimes their soldiers would get bored or need paid and dip. So yes there are plenty of examples of troops gathering for a fight, almost getting there, and going home. But again that isn't really applicable. 

Nowadays wars are fought on a much larger scale requiring industry and tons of stuff, which means there is a much larger investment to mobilizing like this. I mean Russia has the Ukraine mostly surrounded with huge numbers of troops that would be unheard of 200 years ago. That type of investment generally requires more commitment.

To speak to your question, obviously the Korean DMZ is a heavily militarized border but neither side has actually gone home after militarizing. The border between the west and the USSR was militarized to varying degrees at various points, and that usually didn't break out into anything. I guess they all went home when the USSR collapsed.

They affect the population far more than they affect Russia's oligarchs and I'm not sure Putin wouldn't be able to swing Russia's public opinion in his favour in the face of more sanctions as a counter to a military invasion.

At this stage, sure. Totally agree on that point. But that's only for now and only about military aggressions. Putin wouldn't stop at Ukraine if he encountered no resistance or if this situation had revealed a torn NATO.

You figure Russia has been gradually testing the whole west's defenses and reactions to all sorts of aggressions, is taking political control of its neighboring countries, putting pressure on Poland, invaded Georgia and Crimea and is now positioning to invade the rest of Ukraine just because of Nord Stream 2? The pipeline is just another means of profititing and holding sway over the EU, not the goal.

NATO already includes former USSR countries that border Russia. It's true Ukraine's entry has been consistently delayed as a means to appease Russia, as was ignoring the invasion of Crimea. And this is the result of appeasement, as it's always been.

You figure Putin would stop there if he found he could just invade countries unopposed because the west is afraid of MAD? How do you figure China would gauge that too?

So, this is not a Civilization VI. When you attack a country, you don't have to take over it completely. You can just take parts of it and force the rest of the country to agree on some rules, like not entering NATO, being neutral, shifting towards the ideology you want. This is called a [Finlandisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandization), because it happened to Finland after the [Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War). This is also what Russia marked as their preferred way to solve what they see as Ukrainian problem.

Another option is to destabilise a part of the country, like in the case of Transnistria, Crimea/Donbas, South Ossetia, and other countries. Here, you don't need to occupy that part of the country, you just support some strongmen who would form puppet states/areas and claim their independence from the original state. This is enough to throw the rest of the attacked state into turmoil, and it usually takes years to stabilise the situation. This was the case in Ukraine since the year 2014, where a lot of russian soldiers occupy Donbas unofficially and Crimea officially, and there is a constant war there, just with a lower intensity, which is why it disappeared from the TV news of other countries. This is called a [frozen conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_conflict).

No matter whether you see these conflicts on the screen of your mobile or not, there are people dying there. Real people, not pixels. Each of them with the family that would miss them. And this is the reason why we don't just grab a bunch of popcorn and watch this instead of Netflix, because things on Netflix are not real, whereas this is, and can affect people all around the world.

You might ask: ""OK, but how this *quarrel in a far away country, between people of whom we know nothing*, would affect people around me, in safe Kentucky or Manitoba or Utrecht or Yorkshire or Gascony?"" Well, that's easy. If Putin would be really crazy and started attacking other countries in Europe next to Ukraine (namely Baltic countries, Poland, etc),  the situation would be massively different. These countries are in a powerful military bloc called [NATO](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18023383). It's like a federation in Stellaris or maybe some alliance in Civilisation, just in the real world. The moment any country in that bloc is being attacked, they can invoke an agreement called [Article 5](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm), which binds every other country in the bloc to help the defending country. This means if someone attacks Lithuania, it will be defended by armies from Lithuania, Poland, Czechia, but also France, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the USA, all those countries. And that means - there might be people in those countries drafted into the army to help to defend against the attackers. That baker across the street could be drafted into the army. Your older friends you play World of Tanks with could be drafted into the army. If Putin attacks, it's not going to be a nice TV show. It's going to be ugly everywhere in the world, including your town, wherever it is.

The US would never let any build up of troops by its frontiers, I mean no nation on earth would want that. Now of course like many American citizen you wouldn't want to go to Vietnam, just like many Russians don't want to invade Ukraine.

Once again, I am pro NATO, and I think that every country should be able to decide for themselves and protect themselves. However, I also want world peace and I don't like tensions between countries. And for that, we need to try to understand every point of view. Nothing is easy as being black and white, or US = good and Russia = bad. It's important to try and stay objective as much as possible and comprehend all sides. I don't think Putin is just a dictator that wants to rule the world, he just wants what's best for his people (the same way the US would)

The amount of downvotes in this thread related to any comments that try to stay objective is mildly infuriating: people thought I was a bot for expressing my point of view. It goes to show that people are strongly entrenched in their belief and that they easily succomb to propaganda and that leaves no room for a constructive debate to find real solution to try and avoid war. I'm not saying reddit is gonna come up with something that will save Ukraine, but you can see that people are just waiting for Ukraine to get invaded and I feel like some of them are even getting excited and impatient.

Instead of always stigmatizing Russia and bring the world closer to doomsday Everytime a nation joins NATO, we should try to force Russia to enter peaceful negotiations with Ukraine and resolve this conflict by proposing them a NATO membership if they succeed.

 >Finlandization (Finnish: suomettuminen; Swedish: finlandisering; Estonian: soometumine; German: Finnlandisierung; Russian: финляндизация) is the process by which one powerful country makes a smaller neighboring country refrain from opposing the former's foreign policy rules, while allowing it to keep its nominal independence and its own political system. The term means ""to become like Finland"" referring to the influence of the Soviet Union on Finland's policies during the Cold War. The term is often considered pejorative. It originated in the West German political debate of the late 1960s and 1970s.
 
**[Winter War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War)** 
 
 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.
 
**[Frozen conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_conflict)** 
 
 >In international relations, a frozen conflict is a situation in which active armed conflict has been brought to an end, but no peace treaty or other political framework resolves the conflict to the satisfaction of the combatants. Therefore, legally the conflict can start again at any moment, creating an environment of insecurity and instability. The term has been commonly used for post-Soviet conflicts, but it has also often been applied to other extended and unresolved territorial disputes. The de facto situation that emerges may or may not match the official position asserted by either party to the conflict.

They want the protection of NATO. Western European nations drag their feet on letting them in because Putin has them hooked on the promise of cheap natural gas. *Literally* the only thing Putin has to offer the west besides nuclear threats/posturing, and material support for neo-Nazis/white supremacist/far right groups aiming to destabilize Western democracy in favor of authoritarian kleptocracy. 

I’m engaging with you because you’re one of the only accounts who replied to me that isn’t obviously a bot (based on their comment histories). So I’m genuinely curious… Why do you believe the things you believe?

If the west is showing that the strongest defense that they have for our friends in Hong Kong is some fingerwagging, then why do you think that Xi would need to take Taiwan “militarily”?

I mean, yes – the military would move in, but I don’t think that there would be any major bombing campaigns… They would preserve the infrastructure and “Tiananmann” any citizens who resisted. What exactly was our response to the extreme Beijing-directed police brutality during the Hong Kong protests?

My main concern (again as stated previously in these comments) is that even with it being a bluff it only takes one mistake to set off a tinder box.  It is a dangerous game to play to build a bonfire,  pour gas on it and then tell everyone not to smoke near it.

My current take is similar.  Russia cannot afford to occupy Ukraine and the sanctions would crush them.  So now they are trying to weasle out some eastern territory by political means.  It is up to the west if they will allow a repeat of crimea to happen.  

So it is not over in my opinion.  A few minor details have changed but until the mass of troops leave it is still a delicate situation.

It's also only *incredibly weak* evidence that the rock is *effective*.

We have to study the efficacy of the rock through other means: not having the bad outcome doesn't prove the rock worked and doesn't prove the rock wasn't necessary.
