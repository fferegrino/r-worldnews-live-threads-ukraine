Day 335-336 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday it was mostly quiet, people were reporting hearing explosions pretty often, but most of the time they ended up being the sounds of demining efforts, so nothing to worry about. Today was a much less quiet day, as in the morning Russians shelled Kupiansk yet again, this time destroying a store and a private house, thankfully with no casualties.

Then in the evening Russians started sending a bunch of their Shahed drones at our cities, some were going for Dnipro, others were headed to Kyiv and its oblast. There was just one confirmed hit on some industrial facility in Dnipro and we don’t know if it was hit by a drone either, apparently they fired some missiles as well, so it might have been hit by a missile. From what we can tell most drones were intercepted, but they are still sending more of them at us even right now. There were reports of Shaheds being intercepted in Kyiv oblast just 30 minutes ago, and I bet there are more of them still coming.

They must be really upset at the fact that Leopards and Abrams were finally approved for delivery, so they decided to bomb our cities in retaliation as usual. This happens every single time some kind of new military aid gets approved, they always either do a missile strike or send a bunch of drones at us, which never amounts to anything, but I bet Russians feel good about themselves after doing it. Well, they can keep doing it, but it won’t stop western tanks from being sent. The news about tanks finally being approved are just incredible, so it’s only natural that Russians would have yet another childish tantrum.

The cemetery’s location might have remained unknown had local residents not tipped him off that the area was being used to bury the unclaimed bodies of Wagner fighters. Over the course of several visits, he photographed a growing number of grave markers and uploaded them to his Telegram channel, Titushki in Krasnodar.

**Soldiers from 101st Airborne, 10th Mountain divisions expected to deploy to Romania**

STUTTGART, Germany — Army units are gearing up for a potential deployment to Europe, where they are expected to be tasked with deterring Russian aggression in the Black Sea region.

Elements from the 101st Airborne Division’s 1st Brigade Combat Team and the 10th Mountain Division headquarters are preparing for the mission, the Army said in a statement Saturday.

“Preparation for this potential deployment provides flexibility to reassess conditions and respond to a dynamic security environment,” the Army statement said.

The Army said the move doesn’t change force levels, but rather aims to ensure forces are positioned to provide “a robust deterrent and defensive posture alongside our Allies across the European continent.”

The Army statement did not specify where the units are going, but a military official told Stars and Stripes the soldiers are expected to backfill a 101st Airborne Division headquarters and a subordinate brigade deployed to Romania since the summer.

The 101st units were ordered to Romania in June and operate mostly out of Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, which serves as a hub for the Army in the Black Sea region.

During their time in Romania and other locations around Europe, 101st soldiers have been tasked with monitoring events in Ukraine for potential spillover into allied countries, while incorporating lessons from the war into how American ground forces train.

As noted, the russian federation was working on the preparation of a small number of T-14s for the first operational deployment of such tanks in Ukraine.

However, in recent months, russian forces participating in the war against Ukraine have been reluctant to accept the first T-14s, as the machines were in a deplorable condition. Most likely, the problem is a malfunction of the engine and thermal imaging systems.

But if by any chance, Russia manages to conquer Ukraine, it's pretty inevitable that because of that threat/geopolitics etc, sooner or later the West would have to go ""fine we'll do it ourselves""

Olafs statement: he has decided to deliver 14 Leopard 2A6 in coordination with the international partners wich have been granted re-export deliveries or the promise to grant them to provide Ukraine with 2 Batalions worth of equipment.

He very much narrows in on the ""in coordination with partners"" part where he states that this has been a condition for every weapon system that has been deliverd so far and will be the case in the future. 

He denies having been pressured to making a decission by public demand but instead organized this in close cooperation with partners and that this progress has been ongoing behind closed doors for a while.

In the End he apeals to the people of germany that decisions are made with great care and with national security in mind.

Most questions are clarifications but here are some noteworthy ones ( i will be paraphrasing):

By CDU (conservatives opposition) why has it take this long and why not comunicate better and complains about reputation damage? 

Decisions are taken with great care and include planning and organizing to ensure material arrives in ukraine at the same time with partners. He dosent like to comunicate publicly potentialy secret negotiations that can potentialy change until a deal is sealed and preders to present the final decission.
Types of equipment have increased in time to not provoce a reaction in kremlin and goal post have continiuesly been moved forward by international coalition in combined effort.
(Skips rep damage but answers this later on)

Afd(far right opposition)
When will this madness stop? Why has he trashed the peacekeeping efforts of great leaders of his own party from the past and decided to repeat historic error of sending tanks to fight russia wich has sufferd greately from Nazi occupation?

Because Putin broke all agreements and has trashed the combined peace effort and security shareing by pursuing his imperial War of conquest!

Same party different guy: quotes Chief foreign affairs minister and former german ambassador Melnyiks tweets ( yes realy) over the past two days in wich he asks about fighterjets and directly asks where will it stop troops jets etc? What are his wargoals?

NOTEWORTY: a clear NO to fighter jets says germany is not in any talks to provide them (gernany dosent own F16's) he says no troops no no fly zone no direct involvement. Wargoal decided by ukraine but says helping it to defend itself, no commitment to full teritorial integrity ( he dosent mention that explicitly i put it here because its simply absent.

SPD ( his own party, socialists (no not communists) government) what about all the statements of industry and what they can provide ? Explicitly mentions leo 1's 

He will continue to provide ukraine with what it needs and decided on Leopard 2A6 because of imminent availability, combat performance against propable counterpards and availability with allies. Noteworthy is that he skips the Leo 1s entirely.

Oh Boy and now the spicy one

FDP ( liberals government) asks him to directly respond to alegations levied against him in the media.

He repeats the part about coordination with allies ( he did that with the other ones too but i cut those out) and without naming someone specificly says that reasonable actors plan and make sure everything is in order and prepared while others press ahead make bold public claims without coordination and a real plan and also says that those actors are now NOT involved in the combined effort and have to manage the logistics on their own. (This Sounds like polands tanks are not included in the 2 Batalions.) Also denies that there has been tense and loud discussions with partners (like SZ coverd) and everything has been civil and constructive. He says he is thankfull of Biden personaly and Think of him as a great politician and relations between USA and germany are the best they have ever been ( some laughter in the Bundestag after this statement)

https://www.rferl.org/a/putin-s-a-solid-man-declassified-memos-offer-window-into-yeltsin-clinton-relationship/29462317.html

Some excerpts...

> The new prime minister was largely unknown, having risen to the top of the Federal Security Service only a year earlier. **Yeltsin wanted to reassure Clinton that this rising star -- Vladimir Putin-- was a ""solid man.""**
> 
> ""I would like to tell you about him so you will know what kind of man he is,"" Yeltsin told Clinton.
> 
> ""I found out he is a solid man who is kept well abreast of various subjects under his purview. At the same time, he is thorough and strong, very sociable. And he can easily have good relations and contact with people who are his partners. I am sure you will find him to be a highly qualified partner,"" he told Clinton.

...

> During a Kremlin luncheon on April 21, 1996, while Clinton was visiting Moscow, the two discussed the upcoming Russian vote, with Yeltsin giving a stark warning.
> 
> ""There is a U.S. press campaign suggesting that people should not be afraid of the communists; that they are good, honorable and kind people. I warn people not to believe this. More than half of them are fanatics; they would destroy everything. It would mean civil war,"" he said.""They would abolish the boundaries between the republics. **They want to take back Crimea**; they even make claims against Alaska.""

...

> Many Russian officials also began to question informal assurances they said had existed under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, that the alliance would not move eastward. Yeltsin voiced that concern in a May 1995 meeting at the Kremlin.
> 
> ""I want to get a clear understanding of **your idea of NATO expansion because now I see nothing but humiliation for Russia if you proceed**,"" Yeltsin said. ""**How do you think it looks to us if one bloc continues to exist while the Warsaw Pact has been abolished**? It's a new form of encirclement...""

...

> Besides highlighting the extraordinarily cordial relations between the two presidents, Andrew Weiss said these newly released memos also help to highlight the grievances that many Russians have felt going all the way back to the Soviet collapse -- something the former Clinton staffer noted has been encouraged under Putin.
> 
> ""Over time, **the regime has promoted this idea, of Russia being humiliated**, Weiss said.

>Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 24 January 2023
 
>General Colonel Mikhail Teplinsky has likely been dismissed as one of Russia’s key operational commanders in Ukraine.

>Teplinsky was the officer on the ground in charge of Russia’s relatively successful withdrawal from west of the Dnipro in November 2022, and he has received praise in Russia as a capable and pragmatic commander.

>It remains unclear whether Teplinsky still retains his additional remit as head of the VDV, Russia’s airborne forces.

>There is a realistic possibility that debate over the tasks VDV has been given has contributed to his dismissal: VDV has often been employed in ground holding roles traditionally given to the mechanised infantry.

>Teplinsky’s dismissal is likely another symptom of continued divisions within the senior hierarchy of Russia’s operation as General Valery Gerasimov attempts to impose his personal authority on the campaign

Commentary thread from Dara Massicot, of Rand Corporation:

https://twitter.com/MassDara/status/1618273068186767366

>Interesting update on VDV commander Teplinsky’s rumored dismissal. So, the two commanders whose sector were not an operational dumpster fire (Surovikin and Teplinsky) and who stabilized areas under their command, have been shuffled once Gerasimov was placed in command

>This update from the UK states that Teplinsky was on the ground for the Russian retrograde from Kherson city. That operation allowed Russia to preserve major components of the VDV who are now fighting in Donetsk and other areas. Losing them would have been a huge blow. 

>Gerasimov wants to work with experienced staff officers he likes. Ok makes sense but—it’s a war and he’s shuffled around his few competent senior battlefield commanders because why?? based on the fragments of evidence, it seems compliance to is the real selection factor

>DEFMIN Shoygu seems occupied at the moment with delegitimizing Prigozhin, after Prigozhin has made a few too many missteps with his criticisms lately. MoD brass have finely honed self-preservation instincts.

Putin is 70 and in failing health. Their terms are six years, not four, so he'd be president until he's 77. 

Putin is the head of this giant corrupt biomass, and the degree of control he exerts over it is often exaggerated. It is often wholly independent and the control is mutual, it controls him while he controls it. His corrupt elites are self-serving and do have a sense of self-preservation. They have already been asking themselves, privately, what happens after Putin. Him officially staking a claim to rule them until 2030, which is synonymous with him being in power until his death, will make them ask that question even more pointedly.

An electoral campaign will force Putin to take a public stance on the details. He's not the GOP. Even Putin needs a platform. He'll need to make promises to his electorate. Not to the unwashed peasants and all the less-than-human non-ethnic-Russians of course, but his real electorate, the elites. He'll need to talk economy. His prior election strategy of increasing hand-outs and promising even more after he wins will collide head-on with the collapsing economy they have today. While he's playing Tzar he can totally pretend he's unaware of everyone's collapsing standard of living, but when he pretends to be a candidate he has to show he's aware. This election cycle it's inevitable he catches more blame than praise. 

But most importantly there's the tiny matter of the Special Military Operation. Putin has been playing his usual game, just postulating high-level goals and doing a lot of high-level inspirational demagoguery. He publicly pretends not to be involved with the details: his ideas are always correct, and it's the generals who are too stupid to properly execute.

Once he runs, he'll need to take a stance on mobilization, on specific war aims. He'll need to finally give them the definition of victory, as well as a timeline. 

And that's where his candidacy, believe it or not, can still crash and burn. It's fourteen months before votes are cast. Once Putin comes out with war specifics, and once (not if) Russia continues to suffer one catastrophe after another, this may very well have the ""Nicholas II goes to the front to personally supervise the war effort"" effect.",False,1674668584.0,t3_10kplp1,t3_10kplp1,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

It seems like all the coverage of Leopards and Abrams that are or aren't being sent to Ukraine has drowned out the news that the USA is sending 50 Bradley IFVs.

I want to give the M1A1 Abrams it's due; by most accounts it's the most advanced tank that exists in any appreciable numbers. But that's also it's biggest downside. Advanced is great, but it's also complex. It requires more crew training, maintenance, and logistics. The jet fuel it runs on isn't magic, it's kerosene with some additives. But kerosene isn't diesel, and it isn't gasoline, and the Abrams needs a lot of it.

The United States has no problem supplying jet fuel to the front line. They have 11 of the worlds 21 aircraft carriers. They have nearly 400 KC-135 Stratotankers in service, a plane that's only combat duty is mid-air refueling of other aircraft, a tanker plane that is being phased out in favor of the pegasus. 400 of one type of tanker plane with little to no armament compared to the 225 active aircraft that the entire Ukrainian military had at the start of the war. Moving jet fuel from point A to point B is almost trivial for the USA, but for Ukraine it's an additional logistical burden on a system that would probably be better off focusing on diesel, gasoline, water, food, and ammo. (And that's just fuel, spare parts and trained mechanics are yet more of a burden.)

Bradley's are by no means simple  but they are simpler than the Abrams, and that means they'll reach the front lines sooner. Given the state of the war, I think there's a significant difference between a capacity that can be deployed weeks sooner than another. 

Abrams also cost about 50% more than a Bradley, factor in logistics and maintenance and you're probably looking at two Bradleys per Abrams. So in terms of bang-for-the-buck, how does the top end tank stack up against the top end ""not a tank""?

Both seem pretty badass. If I were on the Russian front lines I certainly wouldn't want to have to face an Abrams, but would I rather face 2 Bradleys? From the other perspective, would I rather ride to the front lines as part of an Abrams crew or in a Bradley? I think the Abrams will do great one on one vs any Russian tank. But the Bradley has a TOW missle launcher, (and they're being sent with 500 TOW missles), the optics on the Bradley can spot the enemy at 1-2 kilometers further that they can be spotted, and if all else fails, the Bradley carries 6-7 troops to the Abram's 0, with enough extra room that they can bring a Javelin or 2, and they seem to be pretty good with those Javalins. The Abrams heavier armor is much better against air strikes, but there doesn't seem to be much use for that in this conflict and the Bradley seems to be on par with the Abrams in most other situations, (and at half the cost.)

As a last point, while the USA has lost a number of Bradleys in combat, their crews generally survived. While the west may or may not continue to supply equipment, they will never supply boots on the ground. If the only thing that the Bradley does is save the lives of 9-10 soldiers, that may be worth it on it's own. Wars require both metal and manpower, Bradleys supply them with one and preserve the other.

While Ukraine could use more of everything, what they need more is those things that are fit to purpose. 

As a crude analogy I offer this: Ukraine probably needs more medical equipment. The most advanced piece of  medical equipment is probably an MRI machine. But for the price of one MRI machine you can probably train, supply and support 100 top-tier combat medics for 6-12 month. Sending M1A1 Abrams tanks seems to me to be as foolish as sending MRI machines. It would help, but it's not the help they need, nor the most efficient way to send help.

Any thoughts ?  
Article:  
The process of delivering Western weapons and other military equipment to Ukraine has been one of the most heavily guarded secrets of the war. Concerns that Russia will target roads, railways or staging grounds for the matériel as it is shipped to the front lines in eastern and southern Ukraine has required what officials and experts described as stealth convoys, usually cloaked in darkness or disguised, to evade attack.

Now, with Germany and Britain having announced they will send advanced battle tanks to Ukraine, and the Biden administration expected to do the same, getting the heavy armored vehicles and other combat trucks to the battlefield looms as a challenge for Kyiv.

Russia is not known to have successfully struck a large convoy of Western weapons being shipped into Ukraine, and experts described the process of transporting the huge munitions and vehicles into the conflict zone as a game of cat-and-mouse that Ukraine has been winning.

“Nobody knows, in public, how this is happening,” said Heinrich Brauss, a former NATO assistant secretary general who is now at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “I’m not even sure the capitals know in detail. But they manage it.”

The risks — and worries over provoking Russia — are so great that Ukrainian troops must retrieve the weapons from depots in NATO territory instead of having Western forces or contractors deliver them to the conflict zone.

Nikolai Sokov, an expert at the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and a former Russian diplomat, said that an attack by Russia on a convoy of weapons would “not only delay future deliveries, but also take care of at least a sizable part of modern armor before it reaches the front line.”

A Pentagon spokesman declined last week to discuss the efforts to deliver the more than $27 billion in weapons and security assistance that the Biden administration has already committed to Ukraine, most of it since the start of the war last February. But former Western military officials and experts described a patchwork of delivery routes, largely originating from hubs in Poland, Slovakia and Germany that will be crucial to getting tanks, armored fighting vehicles and huge guns to the front lines.

Most of the weapons will be shipped either on rail cars or flatbed trucks that are strong enough to carry their huge weight. Rail is generally the fastest and safest way to move armor, experts said, given that long convoys of flatbed trucks would likely attract Russia’s attention. It would take too much time, fuel and spare parts to drive the tanks and other armored vehicles to the battlefield, experts said. They would also become, in essence, a moving target for Russian warplanes.

Gen. Robert B. Abrams, a former U.S. Army four-star general who retired in 2021 with decades of experience with the tank that is named for his father, echoed the concerns of some Pentagon leaders who think that it would be difficult for Ukrainian troops to repair and maintain a fleet of the gas-guzzling tanks. And that’s after getting them there.

“The time it would take to get there — to be able to build up the supply stockage, to deliver the vehicles, to train the crews, to train the mechanics, to gather everything you’d need — how long would that take?” General Abrams said in an interview. “I don’t know, but it ain’t like 30 days, I can tell you that.”

The impact the Abrams and its 120-millimeter gun would have on inferior Russian tanks, however, was not in question, he said.

“It will shred them,” General Abrams said. “It’ll put a hole in anything.”",False,1674664086.0,t3_10kplp1,t3_10kplp1,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

Either Abrams or Leopards, because having both MBTs will put extreme stain on logistics, and maintaining them will become incredibly difficult. Having to train mechanics on either both tanks or having only some trained on one tank and the others on the other are one of the many cons of having a diverse inventory of MBTs.

Training a mechanic on both a diesel engine and a turbine engine will be extremely tough and that mechanic won’t be as efficient at repairing either of the engines, if he just learned one and not the other. Training some of your mechanics for one and tank and others for the other tank also presents some issues. For example the logistical issue of keeping track and always having a matching mechanic at hand. Another issue would be the variety of spare parts they would need to move around.

Out of the 2 tanks I think the Leopard 2 would be the best choice, because it is already native to Europe, it can be sent more efficiently and quickly and the logistical lines for spare parts can be set up and quicker as well. Leopards also have diesel engines similar to the engines Ukrainian mechanics already work on. My last point will be that more Leopards can be sent in higher quantities, not because more exist but because not many Abrams of export variant exist in United States stockpiles.

Ukraine needs modern tanks as quickly as possible but we don’t want to fall into the same trap Russia fell into. Logistics is the most important part of war. Leopards would be the easiest to maintain and could be sent the quickest.

Edit: People are responding by saying that they won’t get Abrams anytime soon, I fail to see how this disproves my point? I’m simply responding to people who think a bunch of different tanks mishmashed together would be effective.

You can do it by changing the age of conscription to include older and/or younger citizens, thereby expanding the pool of available draftees without doing actual mobilisation. This has already been done but I think they are still changing it.

Another way to do it would be to remove exemptions that would previously have applied - you’re a student, you have dual citizenship, you’re an essential worker, etc.
If these are no longer valid reasons to avoid conscription, that also expands the pool of possible draftees. Add in an increased crackdown on non-valid exemptions, like bribing your way out, or being protected because you’re some higher-ups son, that will give you even more bodies.

If you are the US, an old F-16 is cheap as they have a huge stockpile.

Troops vary the in value depending on their training, equipment and their availability.

Troops are cheap for Russia because the well trained troops are mostly already dead. Also most of the best infantry equipment is gone or being kept in Russia. Plus mobilisation is constantly under way.

So currently a Russian soldier represents little investment - maybe 6 weeks training, minimal equipment, and is easily replaced.

Compare this to western style NCO, who has had years of training, often Carrie’s specialised equipment and are rare.

The other side of the equation is equipment. Russia is running low on Tanks and APCs now. They still have a lot, but it’s not the seemingly infinite supply they had 6 months ago.

c9f518c0620797dc9e2ab2daeb70f6c6,10kplp1,j5t79gr,"Challenger 2 was designed specifically to counter Russian tanks with the plan to take as many Russian tanks as possible for each lost Challenger. The British doctrine is keep as many in the field for as long as possible.  We may start with 14 to your 100 but by day two we will have 13 to your 80, day three 12 to your 50 etc.  This goes hand in hand with logistics chains and quick repairs/refits near the front, handily most of that is contracted to a British based company and has been since before the current invasion. 

 They are not made for manoeuvrability but have a helluva smash factor.  They are more defensive than offensive on open terrain.  Their entire concept was get to the plains and slow down the Russian invasion before the US could mobilise and get their tanks in the field for a counter.  They were literally designed for the plains of the Southern theatre of Ukraine. To achieve this they are incredibly heavily armoured and have a long rifled gun which outranges Russian tanks by some way without the need for expensive technologically updated ammo. This gun is superb against T72's and below,  it is not as good against reactive armour and as such wouldn't do too well against Abrams or Leopards - fortunately, that's not going to be an issue and they are unlikely to encounter a working Armata.  The gun is also very good at firing at fortified positions, that's going to come in handy... 

Whilst they are made to be the defensive tank they also have superb urban battering ram ability due to the stupidly heavy armour.  See Challenger 2 Squadron in Basra for an example of how they perform in this regard.  I could see the squadron being used as the main battering ram through any fortified urban positions. 

Challenger has a kettle...so...yeh,  that's a definite win! It also has a toilet in built.  If the hatch never has to open your crew are much safer. 

One sneaky extra they may have to their advantage is there are not many Challengers in the world but there are 1000's of Leos and Abrams.  If you are R and Ding tank killing it is unlikely the Russian army has spent so much time on finding the Challengers weak points as they have the other two.  

Leo is a great tank, built for manoeuvrability and will be better able to join in on combined arms warfare than the Challenger.  It's going to be the main support with quick decisive thunder runs, skirting around towns and encircling Russian positions.  It is nowhere near as armoured as the Challenger, there will be some lost to Manpads, you are unlikely to see many/any Challenger kills.  The manoeuvrability makes up for that. The gun is great, superb as a tankkiller although maybe not as good on fortified positions. A lot depends on what ammo they have to go with it. 

Leopard's deepwading is fucking cool.  Hope they have provided the snorkel turrets.  In and out of the largest rivers around Melitopol in seconds.  Surprise Bitches, we're behind you! 

Basically they are different tanks with different capabilities.  Leopards are going to make up the thrust of the speed offensives.

The challenger was designed to fight and hold off a Russian hoard.  As such they are focused on armor and fire power.  They can take a beating but aren’t that fast.  Where was the German design was around fast maneuvers and countering.  So not as well armored but can move quickly.

So in this matchup, is it about holding an objective or securing one? They’ll perform differently.

There’s other finer details like what the gun allows.  Additionally there are more leopards then challengers so there are less strategies to fight the challenger.

In Syria and Iraq, the West is supporting a group that has close ties with the terrorist organisation PKK, in the sense that they pass each other commanders/militants and such. There is (reasonable) worry that the weapons provided to the Kurdish groups also will spill into Turkey.

PKK hasn't been that active in Turkey as far as I can tell in the recent years, probably also because they are busy in Syria Iraq, you get it. Some Westerners started to question just how terrorist PKK is. Just for reference, they are designated terrorists because they 1) attack Turkish military, 2) occasionally attack Turkish civilians in busy cities,  3) abduct civilians, soldiers, teachers  occasionally, 4) attack semi-military (rangers), 5) attack families of police, military... They are a Marxsist-Nationalist weird type of organisation to be receiving sympathy from the West. They sell themselves as freedomfighters if you buy it. There are also some signs of difference in Syrian Democratic Forces (Kurdish Group in Syria), some signals of democracy and shit, which may be a reason they receive sympathy, but the sympathy spills over to the PKK as well. The thing with blocking Sweden is also related, they have some people our government deems terrorist(or has ties with terrorists), although Swedes cites a lack of evidence for their reasons not to give them up. One other reason for the sympathy is that Kurdish language is treated terribly in Turkey, you can see many English signs and words in the cities but no Kurdish. People actively hate Kurdish, don't want to see it, want Kurds to learn Turkish as default... We do have problems.

Tanks need infantry support to avoid getting killed by ATGM teams. Infantry needs heavy protected fire support to break through defensive lines.  A Bradley cant fill the role a Tank can, nor the can a tank fill the role of a bradley. 

A 120mm gun armed tank can take out bunkers, enemy positions and entrenched infantry using its MGs and cannon. While requiring extremely specialised heavy anti-tank equipment to be taken out. Its the role of mobile protected fire support. Also the optics on Abrams are as good as a bradley, and can engage targets up to 4km away.

Ukraine is getting 100 Bradley’s. There were two separate announcements of 50.

Bradley’s are vastly underrated in most of the comments I’ve seen. Firstly, their gun is powerful. It’s enough to take out anything less than a T72. 

They also have 2 Javelin-like ATMs. So they can indeed take out any Russian tank.

Their speed, manoeuvrability and optics are also much better than anything the Russians are fielding. With that extra speed and vision they will have ample chance to take out a tank.

In Iraq Bradley’s killed more T72s than the Abrams did.

It’s likely Ukraine could break Russias lines with Bradley’s alone. With the firepower and accuracy of Abrams as well, then no fortification is safe.

If it was a choice between just Bradley’s or Abrams, I think you’d choose Bradley’s. Any attack needs infantry.

But the best choice is using Bradley for what they are designed for, working in combination with tanks.

So if you have say 500 people armed with mostly light weapons they have a good chance of repelling 1000 advancing soldiers because all 500 can repel the attack. Add 20 attacking tanks and the number of defenders who can do anything about it sharply decreases. Then you still have the 500 soldiers attacking with the tanks to worry about too. If that's not bad enough already, now the soft cover the defenders do have, which is effective at protecting them from rifle rounds, gets blown up with the defenders by the tanks main guns. Tanks also tend to have heavy machine guns with armor piercing rounds that rips right through most soft cover, making anyone behind it effectively exposed and vulnerable. As the losses pile up for the defenders they quickly begin to realize their only chance of survival is to run. Of course, outrunning IFVs and tanks is not easy so you get overrun and have to surrender or get mowed down. Now the defensive line is broken. If a secondary defensive line does not exist the armor can quickly cover large amounts of ground and mop up any support or reserve units scrambling to hastily put up another line of defense. This tends to just result in a full rout of enemy forces until reinforcements of sufficient strength can be brought in to counter the attack.

The reason this is not working well for Russia is because Ukrainian units have been given large numbers of highly effective man portable antitank weapons.

The tanks are only part of the equation, when combined with modern IFVs like the Bradley as mechanized infantry support they work in coordination to suppress anti tank units while allowing the tanks to advance to take out heavy targets while protected by infantry/IFVs on the ground.  

On top of that, NATO's tanks have better survivability than most of the Russian tanks... they allow more protection against anti tank weapons and have a design safer for the crew (ammo stored behind a blast door, not under the turret like Russian tanks).

This decision has been in the works for a long time, it was probably made behind closed doors months ago. I still don't know why people believe all these discussions are really played out in public as much as NATO pretends. Germany wanted to look like it had to be pushed into agreeing, it didn't want to be the one leading the charge to see German tanks heading east to fight Russia again. Russia is not the only one playing the information war game, although of course NATO doesn't say batshit crazy things like the Russians do.

There has been a will we/won't we boiling of the frog for almost every major weapon system Ukraine has gotten. The decision to send tanks was made *months ago* just like the decision to send Bradley's and the other infantry fighting vehicles was made months ago. Does anyone really think that the US decide to give them Bradley's and literally days later we see video of dozens getting shipped towards Ukraine? The number goes from 50 and then almost immediately it's did we say 50? We meant 100.

They do this back and forth dance so that by the time the actual deliveries are announced it makes less news than it would. That undercuts Russia's ability to cry about escalation because it's already been discussed to death. The announcements we get are for public consumption, nothing more. A great example of this was HIMARS. Announced at the start of June, they claimed they were first delivered at the end of June. It later came out they were operating in Ukraine in mid June.

I mean ffs the Punic wars, for example, could be more readily explained by an ascending Rome’s need to supplant Carthage‘s dominant position in Mediterranean - you don’t need some “high school behind the bleachers at 420 woah dude” conspiracy to explain it, they wanted to expand beyond Italy and Carthage had a near monopoly on the Mediterranean. The Crimean war was essentially a spark in the long-standing “great game” that the European powers had been playing across Eurasia for a century; Russia sensed weakness in an ancient rival and the other European powers intervened because they couldn’t allow Russia to shift the mutually agreed upon balance of power.

Remember that for much of human history, the average person was an agricultural labourer, wartime or not. How does someone get “distracted” from scything wheat for a city vs scything wheat for an army?

In contrast, Ukraine already has a major state owned Uranium mine and is one of the big global suppliers of Uranium. It's entirely possible that the Uranium being used in the Abrams tanks built for US use already came in part from Ukraine. At the very least, supplying Uranium to Ukraine who already mine and refine it is not the same level of risk as supplying somewhere like Egypt where Uranium is not already readily available to the military should they want it.

Back in the 1970's (or maybe earlier), the Soviets weaponized the Kurds by supporting a ""socialist"" faction called the PKK. Who you could rightly agree, are ""terrorist"" (by their actions).  They seemed to be less active in the 1990's, but they're always a foil by which Erdogan's government can rile up racist hate towards Kurds. 

You'll recall that Turkey famously did NOT allow western allies to fly over their airspace to bomb Iraq.  That's because they were afraid the west would empower the kurds to carve out a piece of northern Iraq as ""Kurdistan"", and have their own homeland, and rights, and a base from which the PKK could launch terror attacks.

I don't think that the West particularly likes the PKK either. They're mighty inconvenient, as far as Turkey's NATO membership goes.

I think that Russia's Checkists (FSB/NKVD) have made some strong inroads into influencing Turkey's internal politics, and the result is Erdogan. Erdogan's being willfully blind to who the PKK really are, because they're a convenient tool for his supporters. Nothing else.  In the end, I think Erdogan is just playing the fool to stay in power, and that necessarily means doing Russia's bidding. (even though they closed the Bosporus, and sold Bayraktars to Ukraine). Erdogan also should know, that if he gives Russia too much leeway, he's fucked, because Turkey is obviously on Putin's ""Must Annex"" list.

>The survival of Western liberal democracy and the world order that America has built since WW2 is at stake here. 

The complex system of ideas you're referring to have permeating the cultural record for hundreds if not thousands of years and will continue to change and transform through time as more cultural components interact with and negate each other. You might say something, ""well these modern political concepts are in fact new"" but they're not because of the core ideas of the political systems have their origins in other complex systems such as religion which for a time was the ruling system. 

To give you a very generalized example of what I mean. One of the founding principles and scientific theory and western thought is the idea/experience of the ""one truth"". There is only ""one reality/knowledge"" which we can test towards and adjust our theories accordingly. However, framed in this light, it's very clear -- ironically one might add -- the origins of the ""one truth/knowledge"" system. Namely, monotheistic religions. The ""one god"" became the ""one \[scientific\] truth"" a very long time ago. On a more specific-practical level, the rhetorical battles of antiquity and even the architectural structures of some of the religious buildings have persisted into the present day secular realm. Have you ever noticed how the modern day court house has the same layout as a christian church? Judge/altar at the front, jury/choir in the side, and witnesses/congregation in the back and at the pew. It's not an accident, it's cultural drift and it will continue to occur no matter what value system you adhere to.

>If Ukraine loses, the US's standing as a global power is lost forever.

The U.S.'s global power role was by and large an accident and it in being unearned will, of course, go mis-spent from lack of proper experience in how to handle it. We became rich by the accidental oil boom 150 years ago. And the majority of our history has been in reaction to that. Though I guess there's something to be said for our, admittedly, game-changing role in WWII. 

The point being we're going to (probably) go the way of medieval Spain and their gold/boom/find in the new world 500 years ago. That is, become a meddling and only semi-powerful country they way modern Spain is now from their mis-spending of their gold fortune 500 years ago.",False,1674690649.0,t3_10kplp1,t1_j5vv2eb,,2,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Let's be real, Germany is not underfunded when it comes to GDP. Its defense absolutely is historically underfunded, but that's something it's solely responsible for.

They were making some dance around that referendum that technically Duma alone could have passed it, but Putin wanted a nationwide vote so he got it. 

If your question is, why won't Putin just discard the supposed rule of law and rule by decree and make himself the tzar, the answer is, that's against their current social contract. The peasantry won't revolt but the elites might just decide Putin is going too far. Like I said, they do exert some degree of control on policy.

It would take a fundamental change in how the Russian system works. (ie. they'd have to root-out the organized-crime/oligarchs in the upper-echelons of Russian society and policymaking . . . aka their ""elites"").  Because otherwise there's no amount of money they could print or steal or borrow that would rebuild their military at this point.  Because the Russian kleptocrat elites are just gonna keep kleptocratting. 

If Putin could have prevented this, he would have. (and he has tried, as evidenced by the messy sidewalks outside of open 4th-story windows). But at the end of the day, the Russian kleptocracy are the REAL power in that country.

The other REAL barrier to that: a lot of Russia's heavy industry that built their military in the 1970's and 1980's is in Ukraine.  Russia is trying to steal that back, but they're destroying everything in the process.  And then they're going to get kicked out of Ukraine, naked and bleeding. 

I have no arguments about Russia being able to manufacture terror-bombs (missiles), and rifles and ammunition.  They can clearly do that.
