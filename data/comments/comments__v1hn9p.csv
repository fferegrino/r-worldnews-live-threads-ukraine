BBC:

  
EU leaders have reached a deal on banning oil imports from Russia - here's a reminder of what's been agreed.  
  
How much? More than two-thirds of Russian oil imports will be blocked immediately, with that number rising to 90% by the end of the year.  
  
Not all oil: The ban will only affect oil that arrives by sea but not pipeline oil, following opposition from Hungary which is heavily reliant on Russian imports.  
  
€400bn ($430bn, £341bn): That's how much the EU currently pays Moscow for oil and gas. Russia supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas.  
  
Gas not included: But so far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.  
  
A tough process: EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban, with Hungary its main opponent. The compromise followed weeks of wrangling until the pipeline exemption was agreed",False,1653980405.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,57,0,57,0,0,

The incomprehensible concentration of the Ombudsman's work on numerous details of alleged ""sexual crimes committed in an unnatural way"" and ""rape of children"" in the occupied territories, which cannot be confirmed by any evidence, has only harmed Ukraine and diverted the attention of the world media from the real needs of Ukraine.

Ukraine is working on an “UN-led naval operation” with navies of partnering countries to ensure a safe trade route for exporting its agricultural products, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday.   

""Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with navies of partners ensuring a safe trade route with no security risks,"" Kuleba wrote on Twitter, without providing any further details on the operation.

More background: On Friday, Zelensky said that 22 million tons of grain, accounting for nearly half of Ukraine’s grain export supply, is being held up by Russia's blockade of the main export routes through the Black Sea and Azov Sea.

Day 97 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It looks like today there was no confirmed shelling in any district of the city, but that doesn’t mean that it was quiet; it was extremely loud most of the day. Our artillery was very active today, probably more active than ever. We heard them fire at something for hours at a time, actually at first we thought that it was incoming shelling because of how loud it was, thankfully it wasn’t.

There doesn’t seem to be any movement in Kharkiv oblast, not confirmed one at least, but situation around Kherson continues to look promising. Though in Kherson itself Russians started selling their own sim-cards and also taking citizenships applications on the streets, don’t know if anyone took the offer.

It is also both hilarious and absurd that Russians appointed some random blogger as the head of their occupational administration in Kherson, who the fuck even is this guy. All he does is say how much everyone in Kherson wants to be a part of Russia, which is complete bullshit, just like everything Russia says. What the hell are they even thinking when saying that Poland apparently wants to annex Ukraine for itself, all Russia does is project its own ambitions onto others.",False,1654047406.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,83,0,83,0,0,

From CNN's Robert North

Danish energy firm Ørsted has confirmed that Russian state energy giant Gazprom will halt gas supplies starting on June 1 after Ørsted refused to pay for gas in rubles. 

""At Ørsted, we stand firm in our refusal to pay in rubles, and we’ve been preparing for this scenario, so we still expect to be able to supply gas to our customers,” said Mads Nipper, group president and CEO of the Danish firm.

Ørsted warned on Monday that it could be cut off, adding that preparations to minimize the risk to wider supplies include filling up its gas storage facilities in Germany and Denmark.

“Since there is no gas pipeline going directly from Russia to Denmark, Russia will not be able to directly cut off the gas supplies to Denmark, and it will thus still be possible for Denmark to get gas. However, this means that the gas for Denmark must, to a larger extent, be purchased on the European gas market. We expect this to be possible,” according to the firm.

Around 4% of Denmark’s total energy consumption comes from Russian gas, according to European think tank Bruegel.

Finland, Poland and Bulgaria have already been cut off from Russian gas supplies after refusing to pay in rubles. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in March that ""unfriendly"" nations would have to pay rubles, rather than the euros or dollars stated in contracts. ",False,1654012646.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

Can’t imagine the rage many high-ranking officers feel toward Putin as he keeps shoving their young boys into the meat grinder for no good reason.

***EDIT:*** There’s an article limit for the Daily Beast so I’ll paste the article below to save a click: 


Two high-ranking Russian military officers have been caught shit-talking Kremlin leadership in unimaginably colorful language. The two colonels blast the defense minister and lash out at that “motherfucker” Vladimir Putin for his poor strategy in Ukraine, according to a leaked recording of a phone conversation.

While Western and Ukrainian intelligence agencies have routinely reported on plunging morale among rank-and-file Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, many of whom have been heard complaining of dysfunction in intercepted communications, the latest audio appears to be the first to expose frustrations among high-ranking officers.

Radio Free Europe’s Ukrainian service published the curse-laden recording late Monday, reporting that it was provided by Ukrainian intelligence. One of the men heard in the purported intercepted call—identified as Colonel Maksim Vlasov—is no stranger to the eight-year war in Ukraine’s Donbas. He has been wanted by Ukrainian authorities since 2018 for the 2015 shelling of Mariupol—an attack in which he previously implicated himself by carelessly blabbing about it by phone in an earlier intercepted phone call covered by Bellingcat.

The latest recording, dated April 14, is said to show Vlasov and another colonel, Vitaly Kovtun, a doctor at the Naro-Fominsk military hospital said to hold many military honors, raging against the many failures of Putin’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.

They both express particular ire for Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.

“There are horrible losses of our guys, fuck. And you know, I am familiar with military history a bit, and I compare this to the fucking Soviet-Finnish war of 1939-1940. It’s fucking one and the same,” said Vlasov, referring to a war in which the Soviets are estimated to have lost 126,875 troops.

He goes on to take aim at Shoigu, whom he describes as an “incompetent fucking layman.”

“He’s a layman in his work. This is not his fucking thing. He’s just a fucking showman,” the man identified as Vlasov says.

Kovtun responds in kind, saying, “Shoigu is fucking shit. [There are] no contracted forces. Of course not! Why would there fucking be? They paid them 30,000 rubles [$490], where are they going to get contractees?”

The pair also takes aim at the military leadership they say the Kremlin has put in charge in Ukraine.

“Shoigu has assembled all these fucked up [Emergency Situations] guys… if we have head of inspection Colonel-General [Pavel] Plat, fuck, he’s never even served in the army…” Vlasov said.

“They’ve brought forth a whole stellar cast of bootlickers. That [Alexander} Dvornikov is a legend of fuckery… He’s the one who thought up this ‘anti-Banderov push,’” he said, apparently referring to the Kremlin’s narrative about Ukrainians all being neo-Nazis.

“Well, basically, he’s fucking washed up, a brain-dead idiot,” he said.

Kovtun, complaining that Russian forces haven’t been ruthless enough in their assault on Ukraine, blasts Putin personally for Moscow’s retreat from Kyiv.

“A fucking rocket should fly into the Verkhovna Rada [Ukraine’s Parliament] in Kyiv. That’s it, fuck it. Why didn’t [a rocket] fucking fly? I don’t fucking get it, you’re fucked, Putin—motherfucker! Why didn’t a rocket fly into Kyiv, so they’d think… fuck, yes, for fuck’s sake there’s something wrong... something hasn’t been done the right way.”

Reporters with the news outlet say they contacted Kovtun directly to ask how he can call for the Russian bombing of Ukrainian cities when he himself was born in Ukraine and has relatives there.

“Even if [the bombs] don’t hit the target, fuck, let them be afraid,” a man identified as Kovtun can be heard responding in an audio clip of the call, before saying, “I don’t give a damn, I’ll alert the FSB about you and that’s it.”

When asked if that means he’s ready to cop to his words about Shoigu being “shit,” Kovtun suddenly seemed to have a change of heart, saying, “No, I’m not ready [to do that]. I don’t want to.”

Vlasov was also contacted by reporters about the recording, but he immediately hung up, according to audio released by the news outlet.

As of April 2022, Vlasov is said to have held a senior position in the artillery service of the 2nd Guards Motor Rifle Division of the 1st Guards Tank Army of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation. He was also reportedly transferred to the analytical department of the 1st Guards Tank Army, which had a command post deployed to the Belgorod region on the border with Ukraine.

The pair’s expletive-laced venting session has surfaced as Western intelligence reports more and more mutiny by Russian troops on the battlefield. The British Ministry of Defence, in its latest assessment, said Putin’s soldiers are likely going to be even less effective going into the fourth month of the war, due to the “the loss of a large proportion of the younger generation of professional officers.”

“More immediately, battalion tactical groups which are being reconstituted in Ukraine from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective due to a lack of junior leaders,” the ministry said, adding that the shortage of “experienced and credible platoon and company commanders is likely to result in a further decrease in morale and continued poor discipline.”

In line with that assessment, Ukraine’s Security Service on Tuesday released audio of what it said was a Russian soldier telling his wife about his unit’s recent rebellion against a Russian general.

After troops refused to follow orders to go to the frontline, he said, the general “started waving his gun and shooting,” threatening to fire at those who wouldn’t follow orders.

But another guy in the unit quickly whipped out a grenade and threatened the general right back, saying, “Come on, shoot me! We’ll blow up together!,” he said.

“The special forces guys also started pointing their guns at us. So, we pointed our guns at them. Basically, we almost shot each other, for fuck’s sake,” he said.",1654013049.0,1654012190.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

The officials said the HIMARS will be equipped with munitions that will allow Ukraine to launch rockets about 80 kilometers (49 miles).

Some context: That is far less than the maximum range of the systems, which is around 300 kilometers (186 miles), but far greater than anything Ukraine has been sent to date. The M777 Howitzers the US sent to Ukraine last month, for example, marked a significant increase in range and power over previous systems, but even those top out at around 25 kilometers (18 miles) in range.

Further weapons: The new security assistance package, to be announced officially on Wednesday, will also include air surveillance radars, additional Javelin anti-tank weapons, anti-armor weapons, artillery rounds, helicopters, tactical vehicles, and spare parts to help the Ukrainians continue maintenance of the equipment, the officials said.

CNN previously reported that US officials were debating for weeks whether to send Ukraine the advanced rocket systems, because they can strike so much further than any weapons they already have. The weapons’ long range, technically capable of striking into Russian territory, raised concerns that Russia might view the shipments as provocative. 

The officials said on Tuesday that the US is “not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders,” and is “not seeking to prolong the war.”

They also said they had received assurances from Ukraine that they would not use the systems to launch attacks inside Russia. But they emphasized that as the conflict evolves, the US will “continue to tailor” its assistance to Ukraine’s most urgent needs. 

The officials also said the new rocket systems will help put Ukraine “in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table” with Russia, and reiterated that the US will “not pressure the Ukrainian government in public or in private to make any territorial concessions.” ",False,1654054567.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the country is willing to lift its blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports - allowing the safe passage of ships carrying products such as wheat and corn - but Ukraine needed to make the waters safe first.  
  
Lavrov is quoted by the Interfax news agency as telling reporters in Bahrain that he needed Ukraine to ""de-mine the coastal waters in \[its\] territorial sea"" before such a move could be made.  
  
It comes less than a week after Ukrainian FM Dmytro Kuleba described as blackmail a separate offer from Russia to lift the same blockade, in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.

Because Putin publically tentatively has agreed to cooperate with Erdogan, according to Ukrainska Pravda. 

**In truth, though,** Lavrov is being deployed bc Erdogan announced yesterday that Turkey would begin to “tightly control” the stolen grain issue, in compliance with their international law pledged 8 years ago, that wouldn’t permit the offloading or even port use of any vessel that had visited occupied territory.  The Crimean Tartar leader went to Ankara a few days ago, to urge that Turkey enforce this, and Turkey has agreed [see my 2 prior submitted, translated articles].  It remains unclear to me however, if this includes passage, so block passage via Bosporus —one Ukrainian article said it did, but then the official Turkish press release the next day did not mention it.

The revolution in Tunisia didn’t have a leader. The revolution in Tunisia happened because people’s patience with corruption and ineptitude had worn out, and one teenage street-vendor’s desperate act of frustration set it off.



If Vladimir Putin thinks that jailing people who might lead a revolution against him, cracking down on free thought, and ruling with an iron fist makes his regime more secure? He’s wrong. He’s building a house of cards.



Tunisia’s dictator ruled for decades. There is no certainty that dictators fall in any particular time-frame. But literally nobody predicted his fall. Then a young man named Mohamed Bouazizi decided he’d had enough, and before the world could blink, a regime had fallen.



Vladimir Putin really needs to be careful. The theory that dictators don’t have to worry about public opinion is wrong. Dictators need to worry about public opinion maybe even more than most other kinds of government.

The War in Ukraine May Be Impossible to Stop. And the U.S. Deserves Much of the Blame.


https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/us-ukraine-putin-war.html?

One section:

> A handful of people died in the Russian takeover of Crimea in 2014. But this time around, matched in weaponry — and even outmatched in some cases — Russia has reverted to a war of bombardment that looks more like World War II.
> 
> Even if we don’t accept Mr. Putin’s claim that America’s arming of Ukraine is the reason the war happened in the first place, it is certainly the reason the war has taken the kinetic, explosive, deadly form it has. Our role in this is not passive or incidental. We have given Ukrainians cause to believe they can prevail in a war of escalation.
> 
> Thousands of Ukrainians have died who likely would not have if the United States had stood aside. That naturally may create among American policymakers a sense of moral and political obligation — to stay the course, to escalate the conflict, to match any excess.
> 
> The United States has shown itself not just liable to escalate but also inclined to. In March, Mr. Biden invoked God before insisting that Mr. Putin “cannot remain in power.” In April, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin explained that the United States seeks to “see Russia weakened.”
> 
> Noam Chomsky warned against the paradoxical incentives of such “heroic pronouncements” in an April interview. “It may feel like Winston Churchill impersonations, very exciting,” he said. “But what they translate into is: Destroy Ukraine.”
> 
> For similar reasons Mr. Biden’s suggestion that Mr. Putin be tried for war crimes is an act of consummate irresponsibility. The charge is so serious that, once leveled, it discourages restraint; after all, a leader who commits one atrocity is no less a war criminal than one who commits a thousand. The effect, intended or not, is to foreclose any recourse to peace negotiations.
> 
> The situation on the battlefield in Ukraine has evolved to an awkward stage. Both Russia and Ukraine have suffered heavy losses. But each has made gains, too. Russia has a land bridge to Crimea and control of some of Ukraine’s most fertile agricultural lands and energy deposits, and in recent days has held the battlefield momentum. Ukraine, after a robust defense of its cities, can expect further NATO support, know-how and weaponry — a powerful incentive not to end the war anytime soon.",False,1654022960.0,t3_v1hn9p,t3_v1hn9p,,0,3,0,3,0,0,

> The President’s statement that the US will not give the Ukrainians weapons capable of taking the war into Russian territory is an act of strategic incoherence and incompetence. It is morally reprehensible as well.

> When a smaller country is fighting desperately for its very life - and that is no cliché in this case - it makes no sense to prolong the agony, give the aggressor the advantage of home sanctuary, and show yourself to be fearful. But that is what the administration has done.

> It undermines our standing with our allies, confuses our own bureaucracy and will weaken Ukrainian morale.  It is not only wrong but deeply dumb, and one hopes Congress and public opinion will exact a price for it.

The sudden influx of bots crowing about the defeat of the counteroffensive before I'd even heard about the counteroffensive was a dead giveaway.  Russia always responds to bad developments with a slew of propaganda, to try to get ahead of the narrative.  Not sure why, honestly; the Ukrainians don't need permission from reddit posts to keep blowing up Russians.

I suspect the situation on the Kherson front may be more fatal than we realize.  Ukraine isn't stupid; they wouldn't attack on multiple fronts at once unless a serious breach had disrupted the Russian defenses.

I think that crossing of the river may have genuinely fucked the Russian defense lines.  I don't think there IS a second defensive line.  That's why the Russians keep falling back to ""unfavorable defenses"", as the Ukr MOD puts it.  They're trying to frantically shore up a line that wasn't meant to be broken, and Ukraine is pushing in on multiple axes of attack to increase the pressure.

If the Ukrainians can make it down that highway to the Dnieper, holy hell, that's it for the Kherson front.  They'd be able to seize one of the two bridges, and effectively cut off a ton of Russian troops to the north, whose options would be surrender, fight to breakout, or fucking swim for it.  And the seizure of either of those two major bridges fatally undermines the defense of the other.  Nobody wants to get stuck on the west side of the Dneiper with a shitload of angry Ukrainians barreling down on them.

The Economist  Saturday, October 14, 1854. No. 581               Page 1117

The Russian armies are often armies on paper only. Not only are their numbers far fewer than are stated in returns and paid for out of the official purse, but they are notoriously ill-provided with everything necessary to the action of a soldier. The colonels of regiments and officers commissariat have a direct interest in having as large a number on the books and as small a number in the field as possible — inasmuch as they pocket the pay and rations of the between these figures. They have an interest also in the men being as inadequately fed and clothed as possible — inasmuch they pocket the difference between the sum allowed and the sum expended on the soldiers’ rations and accoutrements. The Emperor provides (or believes he does) for the food, clothing, lodging, arms and ammunition of 5 or 600,000 men; but every one of these who is or can be made non-existent is worth two or three hundred roubles to some dishonest official or officer; every pair of shoes or great coat intercepted from the wretched soldier is a bottle of champagne for the ensign or the major; every ammunition wagon which is paid for by Government, but not provided, is a handsome addition to the salary of the captain or the contractor. Robbery and peculation of this sort is universal, in every rank, in every district, in every branch. It runs through every department in the Empire; and its operation upon the efficiency of the military service may be easily imagined and cannot be easily exaggerated.

Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal.  
The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies.  
According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv.

""Unfortunately, since the beginning of the war and the great suffering of Ukrainians, Ms. Denisova has been struggling to exercise her authority to organize humanitarian corridors, protect and exchange prisoners, oppose the deportation of people and children from the occupied territories, etc. All of these issues are actually made by Iryna Vereshchuk.

The incomprehensible concentration of the Ombudsman's work on numerous details of alleged ""sexual crimes committed in an unnatural way"" and ""rape of children"" in the occupied territories, which cannot be confirmed by any evidence, has only harmed Ukraine and diverted the attention of the world media from the real needs of Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Denisova (the Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights) spent all her time after February 24 abroad. And not in Russia or Belarus, where her status and authority could have helped prisoners, deportees and victims, but in Davos, Vienna, Warsaw and other warm, well-fed and peaceful Western cities».

Today, May 31, Ms. Denisova would be dismissed from her position.

**I fear you raise a great point about flagging interest**. Our Western 'leaders', or at least far too many of them, are more interested in preserving the status quo short-term than ensuring long-term stability and rule of law. Unless they are pushed hard by domestic opinion, they will pressure a premature peace. Domestic audiences are losing interest in this war, and far too many folks are frankly selfish pricks, far more concerned about the price of oil than the atrocities in Bucha. I repeat: several nations of the EU and NATO are troublingly more concerned to conciliate Putin rather than defeat him.  

**Logistically, Ukraine's situation is good if troubling**. There is good news for Ukraine. All the NATO nations, from Turkey to France, are providing weapons to the Ukrainians. Fortunately, major military power houses like the UK and US, as well as the former Warsaw Pact nations once oppressed by the Soviet Russians, are in this for the long-haul. These nations prioritize seeing Russia fail and are willing to spend billions to achieve this geopolitical goal, whereas west Europe's priority appears to still be a return to peace. The supplies to Ukraine are still flowing in major quantities, potentially war winning quantities. 


**Militarily, I repeat the word troubling**. Ukraine's armed defense forces have won major triumphs in the early war, but Russia's shift to the Donbas has enabled them to use their weapons better and prioritize localized operations that seem on the edge of victory. In fairness, this means Ukraine is on the edge of a defeat. Despite decisive victories in front of Kyiv, the Ukrainian military has been unable to replicate tactical victories into operational initiative in the Donbas. The Russian artillery especially remains the King of Battles, capable of grinding down Ukrainian defenses in the Donbas. Hopefully, new western weaponry and Ukrainian numbers will tell, just as Russia's past casualties will lead to lower efficacy as the war grinds on. 


**I still hold victory for Ukraine is probable**, considering how heavy the casualties were for Russians' own military, how motivated Ukraine is to win this war, and from a larger paradigm, how new technological advancements such as the Javelin seem to have clearly shifted military initiative in favor of the defenders, a la WWI.

Its not like this is a random statement just put onto twitter like certain former US presidents liked to do

> Dear Dr. Stetter-Karp,
Dear Mrs. Bossong
Dear Bishop Fürst,
dear Bishop Bätzing,
Dear Lord Mayor Nopper
and above all dear visitors of the Katholikentag,

>Our discussion today is entitled ""Turn of the times and cohesion - society and politics in uncertain times"". I would like to start with the turn of the times.

>That's a big word. Nevertheless, I think the term is appropriate. The war in Ukraine is very close to us not only because it is happening geographically on our doorstep, but also because we feel for the Ukrainians, for those who fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones on the ground, and also for those who have found refuge here with us. And it touches us because we feel that this war is not directed against Ukraine alone, but against values and convictions that unite us as a society, that define who we are: Democracy, freedom, justice, human dignity.

>Putin's war is directed against a peace order that grew out of the commitment ""Never again!"" after two devastating world wars. He wants to return to the law of the strongest, back to a world in which the powerful dictate their will to the weaker.

>Let's not forget: this war has repercussions all over the world. I was in Africa this week, visiting three countries and talking to the heads of government and presidents there. Many people there are worried about the war, because they all sympathize with the Ukrainians, but also because the consequences of this war will be felt all over the world, for example when it comes to food security, when it comes to the price of vital energy supplies. In many of these countries, as many people know from their active involvement here, this is by no means assured anyway, and under the current circumstances, of course, all this will become much more difficult. That is why it is quite clear to me that Putin must not be allowed to get away with his cynical, inhumane war.

>Hence also the tough sanctions against Russia, hence the support for Ukraine, humanitarian, economic and with a lot of funding, and hence also the delivery of weapons to such a war zone. That is something that we as a Federal Republic have never done before.

>I know that this raises difficult questions, politically, ethically, and also very personally, questions that you are certainly discussing intensively here at the Katholikentag and also in your families, circles of friends, and parishes. At the heart of the matter is the question: Can violence be fought with violence? Or, as some people put it: Can peace only be achieved without weapons? It is clear that such questions may and must be discussed. We must treat the different views with respect, however much war and its terrible consequences upset us.

>But I also say: My position on this is clear. We have decided to stand by the victim of this war of aggression, so that injustice does not triumph over right, so that brute force does not prevail as a means of politics. Peace does not come through violent submission; justice is the prerequisite for peace. Bishop Franz-Josef Overbeck expressed it in a similar way recently when he rejected unconditional non-violence for himself and called instead for the overcoming of violence through law.

>Ultimately, this is also an imperative of solidarity with the weaker. Or to speak with the motto of the Katholikentag: It is about sharing life. That is what the churches and the many volunteers in parishes, Catholic associations and organizations in our country are doing. I am extremely grateful for that.

>We experienced this during the pandemic, when we witnessed compassion and consideration in a whole new way. Many church institutions and congregations in particular did a great job in providing care, in helping neighbors or simply by being there and alleviating loneliness. Now, in times of war in Ukraine, they are all back. Church buildings become housing for refugees, fundraising campaigns for Ukraine are launched, volunteers help refugees to arrive in everyday life.

>This gives confidence to those affected, but also to me as a politician, confidence that we as a country and as a society will come through this turning point well, and confidence that this war will not prevail over our solidarity and cohesion. Thank you very much for that.

Communication is a very potent solution to a lot of issues, you and your friend are Russia and West in miniature who have the luxury of being able to talk unimpeded compared to Putin sitting surrounded by a few trusted yes-men and puppeteering everything through proxies and little to no honest feedback; and because things do sometimes take unexpected directions (like Putin actually invading Ukraine) it's good to use imagination to step a bit out of the rigid assumptions.

For instance, ask them ""what do you think happens once Russia launches one or multiple nuclear missiles?"". When/if they answer with some stupidity like ""Nothing, there will be nothing left of U.S. and Europe and Russia will remain and live happily ever after"" that's when you can expand their horizon a bit with some reality. If they answer instead ""Well, I suppose, missiles will be launched against Russia"" they will have heard themselves say it loud and it will start to sink in that ideas and wishful thinking don't actually go hand in hand with reality. After even five minutes of such conversations, people experience how their feelings and rational thoughts deviate and hopefully they emerge more intelligent out of it, even if they were a ""hopeless case"". I mean you only need to give it your best for some minutes, you'd have to be an actual mentally handicapped person not to take in at least _some_ simple truths, like those behind mutually assured destruction, climate after nuclear war, etc etc.

People often realize where they stand on some matter while talking about it and thinking it out loud. We're adapted like that.

Emphasis on slowly.

A long, protracted war is exactly where they want Russia to be, rather than the blitz that Russia thought this would be.

* More time for sanctions to take effect
* More time for NATO weapons to reach the front lines
* More time for Ukraine's reserves to be trained and deployed.

------

Ukraine's timetable is, and always has been, to defend until the weapons arrive to the front lines. With MLRS systems beginning to be deployed, Ukraine is yet again in a position where it should defend and wait even longer for the training + systems to enter the battlefield.

There's no point in Ukraine attacking today, when MLRS will be coming up to speed in the next 2 months.

-------

So lets look at the reverse. Russia is advancing with **all their might**, and the most they could get in the past 2 weeks is half of Severodonestk? And MLRS systems aren't even at play yet? And for the first half of May, M777 artillery wasn't even in the battlefield yet?

What's Russia's plans when Ukraine receives longer-range and bigger weapons than ever before? Russia lost thousands, maybe tens-of-thousands of troops trying to capture just 1/2 of Severodonestk.

In 1989, the Marine Corps began a program to upgrade their M14s into DMRs. The final product created by the Precision Weapons Section in Marine Corps Base Quantico was called the Designated Marksman Rifle (DMR), and was intended for use by security teams (SRTs, FAST companies), and Marine Scout Snipers in the cases where a semi-automatic rifle would be more appropriate than the standard bolt-action M40A1/A3 rifle. The USMC Rifle Team currently uses the M14 in shooting competitions.  
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M14_rifle  
  
It doesn't seem like a bad rifle. The chief complaint seems to have been that it did a poor job of replacing 4 different rifles with different roles,   
  
>The M14 was developed to replace four different weapons: the M1 Garand, the M3 submachine gun, the M1 Carbine and the M1918 Browning automatic rifle (BAR).[21] The intention was to simplify the logistical requirements of the troops by limiting the types of ammunition and parts needed to be supplied. However, it proved to be an impossible task to replace all these weapons; the M14 was deemed ""completely inferior"" to even the World War II M1 Garand in a September 1962 report by the U.S. Department of Defense comptroller.[22] The cartridge was too powerful for the submachine gun role and the weapon was simply too light to serve as a light machine gun replacement for the M1918 BAR.[23]

>The rifle was unwieldy in the thick brush of Vietnam due to its length and weight, and the traditional wood stocks made of walnut and birch tended to swell and expand in the heavy moisture of the jungle, adversely affecting accuracy. Fiberglass stocks were produced to resolve this problem, but the rifle was discontinued before the fiberglass stocks could be distributed for field use. With 2,560 ft·lbf (3,463 J) of muzzle energy, the power of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge was valued for its excellent range and good cover penetration, however the powerful cartridge also deemed the weapon to be virtually uncontrollable in fully automatic fire, so most M14s were permanently set to semi-automatic fire only to avoid wasting ammunition in combat.[19][14][24] Although marred by numerous shortcomings, the rifle served during its brief tour of duty with some modest success.[25]

America’s goal is straightforward: We want to see a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine with the means to deter and defend itself against further aggression.

As President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said, ultimately this war “will only definitively end through diplomacy.” Every negotiation reflects the facts on the ground. We have moved quickly to send Ukraine a significant amount of weaponry and ammunition so it can fight on the battlefield and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.

That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine.

We will continue cooperating with our allies and partners on Russian sanctions, the toughest ever imposed on a major economy. We will continue providing Ukraine with advanced weaponry, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger antiaircraft missiles, powerful artillery and precision rocket systems, radars, unmanned aerial vehicles, Mi-17 helicopters and ammunition. We will also send billions more in financial assistance, as authorized by Congress. We will work with our allies and partners to address the global food crisis that Russia’s aggression is worsening.

This is true; and is the basis for how NATO works over the past 50 years.

At some point, a well-armed aggressor is merely being enabled when acting unilaterally, and even if intentions are good, you end up with abuses, (ie. USA -> Iraq).  

In terms of relationships among nations, we must eventually stop letting the ghost of Hitler haunt us: and permit Germany to contribute to this defensive alliance in equal proportion. What we must be vigilant against is the rise of populism and rightwing authoritarianism and fascism. This is VERY easy to spot, and perhaps difficult to stop. Very difficult once its taken hold.  But there is nothing special about Germany - and in fact, I think Germany's LESS likely to become another nazi regime, just because they've already experienced it, and most of them know-better. 

The real danger is continuing to encourage the USA to always take the lead, because we (the USA) are stupid, and delusional: there was a book written back in 1935 named ""It Can't Happen Here""; about the rise to power of a hitler-like dictator in the USA.  And 93 years later, we seem to believe that it's true that ""It can't happen here"" - but it's fucking happening in slow motion, and nobody is trying to stop it - and if you think Putin with nukes is a nightmare, imagine what a USA Putin (or Hitler, or Stalin, etc) will be like with our modern military.

On the other hand, interdependency (as with Russia) also has turned out to be a trap; and again, it's our delusional denial, and refusal to act when we see a dictator seizing power, which has led to this.  The world should have acted 20 years ago to begin to resist Putin. It was so convenient to swallow their bullshit propaganda that ""Chechens are subhuman terrorists who need to be exterminated"" - and we just let Russia commit horrors and atrocities, and we didn't try to stop them, and they just continued all over again without any resistance until the 2014 sanctions in response to the annexation of Crimea.

That's the reason why the USA made so many cluster bombs. Its better to drop 600+ grenades on a tank, rather than trying to penetrate a tank's armor with tungsten balls. Sure, the grenades probably won't penetrate the tank, but you'll mess up the tracks and blow up the external periscopes. The crew will be blind and immobile afterwards.

Tungsten balls? They'll practically do nothing to a heavily armored tank.


The M30A1 and M31A1 tungsten are anti-infantry or lightly armored only. The big debate about ""cluster"" munitions is that the old M30 or older M26 really is a superior weapon vs tanks... but the risk of an ""unexploded grenade"" is too high. The 4% unexploded rate means that every rocket leaves 24 unexploded grenades in the area, which almost surely will risk civilians after the war.

Not really 100% certainty.

Nobody knows where that Russian red line actually is. Only PUTIN can make that determination, and he is purposely obfuscating, (like any bully) in order to take political advantage of the uncertainty this creates.

The west can only proceed with our best educated guess at what will be Putin's ""red line"" (regardless of what Lying Lavrov proclaims).  That line is unknowable. Until Putin acts.

It would be ideal if sanctions would encourage Russia to leave. But that's never going to happen.

But if you look at history (going back at least to the 1950's), sanctions have NEVER compelled Russia to do jack shit. They have ALWAYS endured the suffering. We (the West) want to believe that ""it's different now"" because Oligarchs have influence, and making them hurt should increase effectiveness.  But Russia doesn't seem to be responding even as we watch their economy teeter into the brink of disaster. Russian leadership does not give one fuck. Except: the threats they make, are what they're REALLY afraid of.

I think that Western Allies probably have much more leeway to proceed.  

The US gave up it's SRBM's in 1991 when they retired the Pershing II.  Russia didn't want us putting them into Germany, or Turkey, or Norway, with their 1000 mile range.

Now we're expected to believe that Russia will put the ""red line"" at a missile with a measly 190 mile range (ATACMS)?  (this is our longest-range ballistic missile - until you go up to ICBM's - anything longer-range is a cruise missile - and nobody's talking about giving Ukraine any of those).  The fact is: most stocks of ATACMS are cluster munitions, and even these missiles are discontinued, and in limited supply.  I regard the whole ATACMS issue as a non-issue, and likely a political feint. Russia's going to lose a shit-ton more equipment once the regular 'six-pack' HIMARS missiles start flying.  And it's going to seriously fuck up Putin's day, and he probably won't ever even hear about it until he's firing another General for losing major amounts of territory because he was afraid to tell Putin his arty batteries were getting destroyed.",False,1654009029.0,t3_v1hn9p,t1_ianqmlr,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Sanctions rarely work to actually change or deter behaviour (North Korea still developed nuclear weapons). Unfortunately, there are no sanctions that the EU could impose that would devestate the Russian economy so much that they would forced to withdraw from Ukraine. Russia has tried to make their economy 'sanction-proof' and has large reserves. They are also a fairly autarkic country.  

However, Russia doesn't produce anything, and their economy is very dependent on energy exports (60% I believe) and the EU is the largest buyer. It is very difficult to sell gas to other countries, because you have to build new pipelines, which could take years. So long-term, this will really hurt the Russian economy. Also, exports to Russia have been heavily sanctioned. They import most of their higher technology, which they now no longer have access to. For example there are these Airbus planes that Russia stole. Eventually some will need new parts, but Russia can't get to them so they have to be grounded. People don't notice, because there are still planes left, but eventually Russia will run out of functioning planes. I think this is also what will happen to the Russian economy in the long term.

I think they are misdirected and show a lack of understanding of Europe and America's security arrangements. Let's break this down into two parts: Your concern about continued aggression, and your belief that the only useful move is to directly attack Russia's army in the field.

Russia, if successful in Ukraine, would almost certainly proceed further - just not to the countries you mentioned. It's hit list included Moldova, Serbia, and Georgia. Why? Because these, like Ukraine, are *not* NATO and are *not* EU members, and so are not covered by the security guarantees enjoyed by the nations you mentioned.

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Poland are all NATO countries. An attack on any is by law an attack on all NATO countries including the USA, UK, France and Turkey, and would immediately trigger WWIII.

That is why, despite the Russians' breathless rhetoric about NATO - aimed primarily at their own captive domestic audience and the more terminally stupid members of America's political extremes - they have only attacked non-NATO countries (Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia). 

As for attacking Russia, this may in fact make Ukraine's own security situation far, far worse *and* is not the only thing America can do.

If America attacks Russia, Russia would have to untangle a very difficult web of possible outcomes, faced with an enemy that is, like them, notoriously unreliable and mercurial. Would such an attack really be just a limited repulse of the invasion, Russia would need to ask itself, or a prelude to an invasion, starting with destroying Russia's main ground force in the field? And what are the respective risks of being wrong about either assumption?

Believe it or not, there are actually levels of even *nuclear* escalation. Strategic nuclear war is a possibility, but is not the only hazard. The most likely immediate Russian response would be tactical and local nuclear attacks against NATO and Ukrainian targets *in Ukraine*, in an effort to shield its own ground forces. 

Beyond this, there's the problem of China. Currently, China talks a good game but is mostly neutral in this fight. If Russia faces an existential threat, China, Belarus and other lesser allies will get pulled in, and Russia will have the world's factory behind their war machine. The war would expand from a localised affair to engulf all of Ukraine, and likely other countries beyond. This could make Ukraine's situation even worse. 

In short, direct American intervention may well make life worse for Ukraine, by making it a battlefield for a larger and more dangerous war. 

So what can America do? Transfers of weapons are great, and America is doing that, eventually, limited air and naval support are conceivable but unlikely. 

For the other countries you mentioned, NATO has beefed up its eastern presence, and most NATO countries have increased defence spending. Biden has deployed American troops to Europe in case Putin is even stupider than he looks, and America   
through NATO is coordinating an alliance-wide response to ensure everyone is ready to guarantee the sovereignty of NATO's eastern march nations. Further, Biden is supporting the expansion of the NATO alliance to include Finland and Sweden. Economic and diplomatic leverage is being used to enforce sanctions. 

I do not envy the choices Biden has had to make, but they have been well reasoned ones and seem the most likely to actually help Ukraine survive and prevent their situation from getting worse.",False,1654026882.0,t3_v1hn9p,t1_iap51vf,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Even assuming that nobody escalates to a nuclear holocaust, the Baltic States are very interconnected military and economically so you would need to take them all at the same time, 

and Poland are working through a modernisation program now, as well as being very nationalistic and being reliant on hit and run tactics through the use of older tanks and swarms of Infantry Fighting Vehicles.

As for Romania god knows, but expect to also have to hold down Moldova, while Turkey keeps the Black Sea on lockdown, so no naval replacements unless you can get them through the Russian canal system.

I count 6 fronts, through Poland, all 3 Baltics, Romania, Moldova, 7 if you throw in a suppression effort in Ukraine, while dealing with military remnants, partisans, and special forces.

Can the Russian state fight and occupy 7 countries, using what it has on hand now, while maintaining Chechnya, Armenia, and dealing with internal security matters, and guarding all of the borders?

And just recently, I welcomed Finland and Sweden’s application to join NATO, a move that will strengthen overall U.S. and trans-Atlantic security by adding two democratic and highly capable military partners.

We do not seek a war between NATO and Russia. As much as I disagree with Mr. Putin, and find his actions an outrage, the United States will not try to bring about his ouster in Moscow. So long as the United States or our allies are not attacked, we will not be directly engaged in this conflict, either by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine or by attacking Russian forces. We are not encouraging or enabling Ukraine to strike beyond its borders. We do not want to prolong the war just to inflict pain on Russia.

My principle throughout this crisis has been “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.” I will not pressure the Ukrainian government — in private or public — to make any territorial concessions. It would be wrong and contrary to well-settled principles to do so.

Ukraine’s talks with Russia are not stalled because Ukraine has turned its back on diplomacy. They are stalled because Russia continues to wage a war to take control of as much of Ukraine as it can. The United States will continue to work to strengthen Ukraine and support its efforts to achieve a negotiated end to the conflict.

Unprovoked aggression, the bombing of maternity hospitals and centers of culture, and the forced displacement of millions of people makes the war in Ukraine a profound moral issue.

They did not. The arms industry leaking stuff the the press as a sales pitch does not equal an official government announcement.

Same thing as above. The industry leaking stuff to the press does not equal the german government promising anything.

All those vehicles were rotting away in a garage at Rheinmetall and on top of that the german goverment had to source ammunition for them (and only got like 60.000 rounds as none of the current user countries was willing to sell them and the swiss blocked exports).

""It has gone from a rate of 250 sorties per day to 400. The aim is to carry out prohibition strikes, with bombs that crush everything. In this instance, the air force's role doubles the artillery's. It is a weapon of saturation, not precision. With their salvos of 122-millimetre rockets, the Su-25s will raze an entire area and do a lot of damage,""

There will also be less use of the Russian language and with the failure of ""Russification"", there will be more and more breakaway Islamic states. Which leads to..

Religious existential crisis - the Russian orthodox church is losing authority - Ukraine has their own branch of orthodoxy, and Islam is on the rise in the caspian areas.. these states will breakaway. Which leads to..

Military existential crisis - some borders are defensible, some are not. With the loss of Ukraine, Russia cannot be practically defended by such a poor state. With other states breaking away, the dam will open and Belarus will leave too and join NATO and the EU. This will leave core Russia as a tiny state, with no national basis - a dead rump.

Ukraine could be making gains near Kherson to cut Belgorod off as a supply line to Donbass. Russia could be pulling those troops to exploit a breakthrough in the Donbass and opted to supply their main forces entirely from the east, abandoning a massive urban battle and taking a stronger force to land more favorable for tank and artillery warfare. 

Ukraine could have a great success in encircling Kherson from the north and cutting off Russians on that side of the river.

1. Light cavalry -- Ride a horse **close** to battle, dismount, then shoot your rifle.

2. Heavy cavalry -- Ride your horse **into** battle, killing people while you're still on the horse.

Sabers would be issued to Heavy Cavalry. Motorized / Mechanized infantry seem to have more similarities to light-cavalry IMO than the heavy-cavalry that would have received these swords.

Combat vehicles have undergone a similar evolution: fighting dismounted vs fighting mounted are two things that modern mechanized infantry train for (and those mechanized infantry support modern tanks).

So I guess... the two Cavalry uses have merged into a singular, mechanized infantry kind of arrangement.

I do agree that anyone thinking Ukraine is in a great position and have no worries for their success is clearly smoking something and no amount of extreme Russian incompetence in the early phase can make up for it.

The arguments I'd make in favor of Ukraine winning is a mix of them mobilizing early and hard (something Russia hasn't done). This is something that worries Igor Girkin (former military leader of the Donbas republics) and he thinks Russia might lose even if they secure the Donbas regions just because Ukraine will just have much more men and the capability to have them be rested.

We've yet to see a proper large scale offensive by Ukraine and while their capabilities on that front is unproven and could be grossly inadequate I still think it's a factor to consider especially as the war grinds on and there's been a lot of doubts cast on Russia's capability to get more men and to keep their economy afloat.

Also a big factor is the sanctions. If Russia ever wants to lift them and get their industry rolling they have to give some type of concessions that Ukraine accepts. It's hard for us to gauge how impactful this is however.

So TL:DR I'm still fairly optimistic for Ukraine's chances. I don't think they are staring down a linear path of losing more or just getting stalled but I won't deny it's a very real possibility.
