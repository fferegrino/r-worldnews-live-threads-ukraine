Day 101 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling continued as usual, mostly in the evening, around 10pm shelling was pretty bad, it sounded pretty close, but it might have been a couple kilometers away. People from Kharkiv oblast were saying that today’s shelling was one of the worst in recent times. And as always, every day close to midnight missiles get launched from Belgorod, not sure where the ones from today landed.

There are reports from officials saying that our forces in Kharkiv oblast are currently fighting for Tsupivka and Velyki Prokhody. We probably won’t immediately know if they are liberated or not, as even liberated settlements mostly stopped getting officially confirmed as being liberated.

It looks like Sieverodonetsk still stands, and probably won’t fall too soon, especially with current counteroffensive by our forces. It’s pretty funny that the one who confirmed this counteroffensive was Girkin (Strelkov), when only our side says about it there are usually some doubts, but when he says something about Russia’s losses, you just know that it’s serious, as it always turns out to be true. 

I don’t understand how he is even allowed to hate on Russian army so much, everything he says is true, but usually the truth is not allowed in Russian media. When most people on their main channels praise Russian army, Girkin just shits all over it, says how much they actually suck, and then praises Ukrainian army for their accomplishments, it is always hilarious to watch.",False,1654393448.0,t3_v4goca,t3_v4goca,,0,95,0,95,0,0,

“So far, I see no reason to initiate further negotiations,” Arakhamia said Friday, “until there is really some big change at the front.”

He said the current situation is “one step forward, two steps back” as Ukraine tries to push the Russian forces out of occupied villages and Russia takes over new areas.

“Negotiations must continue when our negotiating position is strengthened,” he said.

“And it can be strengthened now,"" he said, when weaponry ""constantly promised to us by international partners ... will eventually arrive in sufficient quantities.""

“The armed forces are ready to use it, new brigades have already been trained and formed. And then we can initiate a new round of negotiations with an intensified negotiating position,” he added.",False,1654354119.0,t3_v4goca,t3_v4goca,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

From Julia Presniakova, Taras Zadorozhnyy and Bex Wright CNN.

Ukraine now controls around half the city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine after reclaiming some ground from the Russians, Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region military administration said.

Hayday was responding to a question about an intelligence assessment from the UK defense ministry, which predicted Russia would control all of the Luhansk region within two weeks.

Two weeks is unrealistic. It's just unreal,” Hayday said Friday. “Earlier there was a difficult situation, and somewhere around 70% [of Severodonetsk] was captured, now we have already moved them back somewhere around 20%.” 
The Russians “had previously managed to capture most of the city, but now our military has pushed them back. They are really suffering huge losses,” he said in further comments on Saturday.

“The difficult situation remains in the region as a whole, and Severodonetsk is now just a concentration of hostilities because the Russian army -- as we understand -- is throwing all its reserves into this direction,” Hayday said.

Currently the Ukrainian military lacks long-range artillery, which could be a game changer for the battle in the east, Hayday said.

“They are moving forward step-by-step. They are simply destroying everything with artillery, aircraft, mortars, tanks,” Hayday said. “But as soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry will just run.”

Street fights continue in Severodonetsk, and Ukrainian troops are still “trying to push back the enemy,” he said. 

On Friday, the Russians “tried to surround the Ukrainian troops” in the city and neighboring Lysychansk, but were unsuccessful. In total, Ukraine repelled a total of nine attacks by the Russians in the Donbas region in the past 24 hours.

Russia is also blowing up bridges to prevent Ukraine sending in reinforcements to the region, Hayday said.

“They are really afraid that the success of our defenders will develop, and this can be done if the ammunition, weapons and reinforcements are provided in time. This is the first thing they are afraid of,” Hayday said. “Luhansk region is a huge outpost for us, we are holding it now.”

Around 30 km (18.6 m) south of Severodonetsk, three people were killed on Friday, including a mother and child, in Hirske, Hayday said.

The humanitarian situation in Severodonetsk is “very difficult,” Hayday said, as they are currently unable to safely evacuate people or bring in humanitarian aid to the city.",False,1654331732.0,t3_v4goca,t3_v4goca,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

>**Are you planning to go to Kyiv soon?**  
>I went there in February to try to avoid the war. Today, I'm not ruling anything out. We have just taken a historic decision with the sixth sanctions package with an embargo on 90% of Russian oil. We want to increase financial and military support for Ukraine. And finally, to do everything to get cereals out of Ukraine. Ukrainians are fighting with courage, they deserve our support and our respect.

>**Arms deliveries to Ukraine continue. Six Caesar guns were sent but they were taken from the French forces. Does it weaken us?**  
>These deliveries will be compensated. And I asked our industrialists to speed up the production of armaments, it is not just a question of replenishing our stocks but also of strengthening our independence.

>**We talk about arms delivery, we see neighboring countries wanting to join NATO... Is there a risk of escalation?**  
>The situation is worrying, it is true. That's why I put so much time and energy into it. I have lost count of the conversations I have had with Vladimir Putin since December. In all a hundred hours in transparency and at the request of Zelinsky. We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels. I am convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power.
  
>**What is your perception of Vladimir Putin?**  
>I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental mistake for his people, for himself and for History. Nevertheless, Russia remains a great people. I think he isolated himself. Locking oneself in isolation is one thing, knowing how to get out of it is a difficult path.

If I can put my own perspective on this-- he wants to deliver weapons. He's ignoring that Putin says Ukraine has no trouble exporting their grain, and says they need to do everything possible to help Ukraine do so. He says Ukraine are greatly deserving of respect. He told Putin that he was making a ""historic and fundamental mistake"". Given all of these things, I think what he was trying to say with the ""must not humiliate \*Russia"" comment is rather that diplomatically speaking, he wants to avoid spiting \*Russia to the point where \*Russia refuses peace on principle (i.e. rubbing \*Russia's nose in its failures).

They’ve just finished a game of basketball, and are sitting down in the Chechen leader’s war room to discuss tactics.

Shoigu looks nervous, he leans in and whispers: “Psst, Kadryov, The Ukrainians are kicking my arse so badly my pants have huge holes in them.

Kadryov, a little tipsy at this stage yells “what!? But my Tik Toks are more popular then ever! One of my troops made one the other day that reached 2 million views! He was getting shelled while posing with his gun and then the screen went all red. …I don’t know why it was so popular.”

Shoigu, looking stern replies “seriously, we are running out of troops.”

Kadryov, snorts his vodka indignantly, “YOUR TROOPS ARE ALL DEAD!? where did they go? My men haven’t shot that many deserters!”

Shoigu looks like he’s just dunk some polonium tea. White as a ghost, he whispers urgently “shhhhhh!! It was impossibly unforseeable. Instead of just lying down so my troops could rape them, the Ukrainians shot back.”

Kadryov states in a big booming voice, ”I was not aware of this! My friend! I will give you all my remaining troops today!!”

Shoigu, looking relieved murmurs “Thank you. Putin will remember this. ….why haven’t your troops told you? We’ve had some issues with this too. After Putin defenestrated a couple of messengers.”

Kadryov, frowning in concentration, replies “Hmmm… No. It might be because they are all dead! But my remaining troops, Igor and Ivan here, will happily fill your ranks!! So… Time for another vodka, my comrade?”",1654318623.0,1654318162.0,t3_v4goca,t3_v4goca,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

World War I happens and is disastrous for Russia. The Tsar is not the right man to lead Russia and makes a ton of mistakes that lead to The Revolution in February 1917. His replacement, Kerensky,  is not the right man to lead Russia to Democracy, as he also makes many mistakes and is  beholden to the Petrograd Soviet. He also has very little basis of any government  institutions with which to build a successful democratic government. 

So, the Bolsheviks forcefully take power in 1917 and utilize the Tsars old institutions to maintain social order while fighting one of the bloodiest Civil Wars in the 20th century. Communist rule throughout the 20th century leads to its own set of undemocratic institutions.

British Bomber Command night bombing plus USAF daylight raids once they got into the war meant that German heavy industry was, by about 1943, experiencing 24-hour round the clock disruption of a kind previously unseen and unknown. You can't rebuild a factory or even recover the tooling to move it elsewhere if it's literally being bombarded constantly until there's nothing left.

British Royal Navy also substantially decapitated German naval forces that would otherwise have been able to harass Soviet operations in the Baltics.

US also kept Japan busy in the Pacific Ocean which effectively halted their Westward and Northward expansions in mainland Asia.

Allies also dealt with Italy, secured the Mediterranean and Middle East, and stopped Germany gaining a foothold in Africa that would have been hugely difficult for the Soviet Red Army to reach.

Let's also add in that Soviet combat losses are estimated to be around 11 million, in just one theatre of war. For reference, although the Eastern Front was Germany's bloodiest conflict zone, their combat losses across the *entire* war, against all adversaries, were around 5 million. All of the Axis forces deaths summed (Germany, Japan, Italy, Romania, Hungary) still come in at a lower total than the Soviet Union.

fb0f41aee122aa3bd23b7d61b09b5b77,v4goca,ib5tnrn,"Treaty of Versailles is a myth. (or rather, the narrative that said that the treaty was ""too harsh and humiliating for Germany: therefore, it caused the rise of Hitler, and WWII, etc"") - although it's a popular myth, and at least in MY case, it was taught to us in school, in history class.

All you need to do is ask yourself:
""if this is true, then why didn't the far-more-humiliating measures after WWII (invasion, partition, decades-long occupation, trial and execution of Nazi leadership, regime-change, etc) lead to an even worse Hitler, and WWIII?

I would posit that perhaps the Treaty of Versailles didn't go nearly far enough, and that the community of nations did not do enough to maintain unity, so they couldn't maintain strict limits on Germany's buildup of military power in the lead-up to WWII.  And they weren't able to stop the spread of Nazi ideology and propaganda in their popular media and Germany's ""zeitgeist"". 

I'd say that THAT is what ""caused"" WWII.

And the world has made many of those same mistakes in the run-up to the current Russia situation. 

How should Russia be reigned-in when this war is finished?  
The same way Germany and Japan were.  

Lets even go further with this analogy, and look at the situation the USA is in, currently - we're teetering on the brink of fascist dictatorship. We're probably only one election-cycle away from authoritarian/minoritarian rule, and while you could look at the USA and how we pretty much deserve what's going to happen to us - due to our complacency and national stupidity - we did NOT get here by the same route as Germany.  We did not suffer some huge massive military defeat. We have not had our economy constrained by the will of an alliance of aggrieved victims of US aggression. 

All we did was allow the fascist narratives and propaganda take hold in our popular culture and newsmedia. (the military buildup was a separate issue).  Now it's so deeply ingrained, it's not likely we'll be able to go back to the way things were in say, the early 1990's, let alone the post-Nixon era. (zeitgeist-wise). 

And while it is sad to see the USA head down this route, it's also terrifying due to our powerful military, and our huge economic influence on the rest of the world. It's potentially going to lead to tragic and catastrophic circumstances. Maybe not in 5 years, but possibly 10-20. 

Germany? After WWII's aftermath, they're not a threat to anybody. Least of all their neighbors. 

So the intent of this ""Treaty of Versailles was too humiliating to Germany"" is most likely to imply that we (the international community) should not be ""too mean"" to Russia when this conflict is over.  Accepting this line of reasoning is a mistake. Proceeding to let Russia ""get away with"" their aggressive behavior, and their barbaric, genocidal conduct, is a mistake. It enables and encourages future bad behavior.  

Russia must be disarmed. And Russia MUST have a regime change. I think their constitution should also be burned, and re-written. And moving forward, Russia must not allowed to re-arm ever again.  Should they be permitted the same security guarantees Germany was, after WWII?  I don't see why not - as long as Russia does not abuse that position by further marginalization of its various ethnic groups and minorities. (they deserve security guarantees as well).",1654361819.0,1654361600.0,t3_v4goca,t1_ib5r2k8,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

There is lots of good news. Start here:

It's not.

Russia has been artificially propping up the ruble since the first big wave of sanctions hit in March, and it dropped to an all-time low.

They are trying to keep the mere appearance of its value high at all costs, but it's largely a short-term illusion:

https://www.reuters.com/business/russias-rouble-rebound-is-not-real-it-seems-2022-04-01/

> Why my national media reported Ukraine is losing the war...

I can't really speak to why they would report that, but it's substantially untrue.

Ukraine has lost, in total, about 10% of its territory since the 24 February invasion. Russia has suffered enormous losses of men and equipment, been defeated at Kyiv, and subsequently pushed out of several key areas, including Kharkiv.

> ...the army is giving up hope...

This is a serious misrepresentation.

The only case where this really happened was in Mariupol, which Russia surrounded in the earliest days of the war, because it's right between Crimea and their most heavily entrenched regions in Donbas (from the earlier invasion). And that cost the Russians dearly.

> ...the leader abandoned their soldier. 

This is absolute rubbish. Zelenzkyy has in no way abandoned Ukraine or its troops. He is, in fact, constantly and rather impressively working to get them more weapons and better ones, and better training for their new recruits.

It's notable that Zelensky and his commanders have insisted on a fairly complete training process for their new troops, rather than just throwing bodies into the fight.",1654344526.0,1654343897.0,t3_v4goca,t1_ib4vrlb,,1,29,0,29,0,0,

Nothing that really indicates that. There's been some speculation that Russia has learned from their mistakes and will now make ""steady"" progress forever but there's also a lot of speculation and reports that Russia will run out of steam soon either before of after they might push Ukraine out of the Donbas.

There's been no reports of that. Might be based on when Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fighting in Donbas is hard and that currently they lose about 60-100 soldiers a day (but they claim they are killing more Russians so worth to put it into perspective)

>the leader abandoned their soldier

There's been some accounts of some volunteers on the frontlines who've said they felt abandoned or had too little equipment. Hard for us to confirm or say how widespread it is. And worth saying that once again we have even more similar reports from the Russian side. 

>Moreover, the Ruble is recovering.

The ruble was collapsing until Russia closed the markets and disallowed people from trading it freely. So it hasn't ""recovered"" but rather it's been isolated and propped up by currency manipulation techniques. The Russian economy is sanctioned and their biggest problem is that they can't import high technology assets and the spare parts needed there. So it's far from that their economy has ""recovered"" but more that they have put up a lot of short-term drastic measures to keep it from flash collapsing and we might see stronger effects of this later in the fall.",False,1654341162.0,t3_v4goca,t1_ib4vrlb,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

And with the imports cratered, the Rubles are not spend. 

Which pushes up the course, since the demand is artificially high. But only in context due the market where they were usually spend being erased.

Thus while it might LOOK to recover, it's basically a sort of economical rigor mortis since factories are shutting down and the economical situation is worsening by the day, as their reserves are drained on top.

There was one leak that showed a ~800 person BTG that only had 470 people assigned BEFORE the war started. 500 people seems “fair”. 

So 16 BTGs times 500 people per BTG gives you ~9,000 people, plus any Army level assets.

80% of the raw copper and and 55% of the raw aluminum used by USSR was supplied by the UK and US.

Also UK and US provided literally 100% of their aviation fuel since the only high octane refinery in the USSR got destroyed by Germany like day 1 of Barbarossa.

Please. No serious historian believes you lol

Oh I forgot to even mention the machinery that the US provided to make those tanks and aircraft...

Production is just one piece of the puzzle, without raw material and machinery you can't produce anything...

Beyond the raw material, 1/3 of all USSR vehicles by the end of the war were provided via lend lease.

2/3 of all logistic equipment were provided via lend lease.

Half of all explosive material provided via lend lease.

I'm just going to keep adding more as I find them.

1/3 of ammunition of all calibers were provided via lend lease, either thru providing the explosive material and metal or provided out right.

Also note that lend lease doesn't include material bought via credit lines given to the USSR from UK and US in 1940 and 1941. Around $1 billion worth of material.

a4fb4f9a11aa3e9ccd0038f97a6286f7,v4goca,ib58qdp,"It's a complicated question with a lot of factors. Ukraine has had a different history than Russia. 

Ukraine had a period of time they were under the control of the  Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth as well as some more democratic Cossack Hetmanates, which allowed for some historical basis and culture by which democratic institutions could be build upon. 

Side note: One of Russia's biggest cultural coups was convincing the world that the Cossacks were Russian. Bohdan Khmelnytsky is still a Ukrainian national symbol to this day, and rightfully so, he did quite a lot to keep the steppe independent of both Poland and Russia. 

So Ukraine had more western influence and a strong independent streak even into the 20th century. They tried for a long time in the mid 17th to 18th centuries to be autonomous, but we're eventually split between the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia at the Dniper River. (right bank vs. Left bank Ukraine). This right vs left bank split is a big reason why Ukraine post 1991 was very much a country without a clear identity. This split also was different from Belarus, who was more homogenous, and Russia who always had a social order where the Russian majority was in strong authority positions, even in minority majority regions. Ukraine's split was closer to 50/50 and allowed for clear majority and strong minority parties in the Rada post collapse of the USSR. No one party enjoyed super majority support like the United Russia Party in Russia. 

The road to today has not been perfect. Ukraine long dealt with antisemitism (notably in the early 20th century) , internal divisions, and a lack of a cohesive national identity post independence.

But, despite those historical shortcomings, Ukraine has been able to leverage its history in a positive way and start to root out the corruption that persists as a vestigial organ of the Soviet apparatus. I think a big part is that the post soviet generation have seen what has happened to their neighbors in the EU and want the same future for Ukraine.

So TLDR Ukraine's history is not Russia's history. Ukraine has tried to be independent from Russia for generations and has a population that led to stronger democratic traditions and the inability of one leader or party to form a super majority post 1991.

Humans tend toward having a retaliatory streak.  Getting even is not ""the right thing to do"".  But the inclination is hardwired instinct.  Maybe Ukraine will restrain themselves in ways that other nations have failed.  

Biden said something about not hitting Russia.  That is certainly not a mandate to blow up civilian areas in Donetsk.  But...

In medieval warfare it was common to harass population in order to let them know they were not protected.  In WW2 the US launched the Doolittle Raid just to let the Japanese know they were not safe.  Britain and Germany went through multiple cycles of escalating air bombing of civilian areas.  

It would not be a good choice but I would not jump to be judgemental if Ukraine blows up one car.  Maybe criticism is appropriate to deter repeats.  However it is certainly absurd to say ""this is an event that could not possibly happen because of character"".

If that's crazy, the *civilian* death toll of the USSR was about the same again.

The second most impacted country, although people never really talk about it for some reason, was China, which suffered huge massacres following the Japanese invasion, and also substantial military losses - Chinese deaths sit around 20 million, with about 4 of those being combat deaths. However, the reason it's not talked about is that most of these deaths happened *before* the invasion of Poland by Hitler. The question is whether you consider the Japanese invasion of China to be part of WW2, or whether the Second Sino-Japanese War is a separate conflict.

The ""usual"" WW2 dates given are from the start of the war in Europe to the signing of the Japanese surrender, so 1 September 1939 (Hitler invades Poland) or 3 September 1939 (UK and France declare war on Germany, the first formal declaration of war) to 2 September 1945, 6 years almost to the day.

However, there's lots of ""different"" arguments about when the war started. Russia (and many former Soviet member states or satellites) use the dates of the Great Patriotic War (so starting 22 June 1941), some use the start of the Winter War (30 November 1939), the US often counts ""official"" WW2 as being from Pearl Harbor (so 7 Dec 1941). The Japanese invaded China in July 1937, but until 1941 this war was wholly separate from ""World War 2"", despite becoming part of it.

So, depending on who you ask, WW2 started:

+ 1 September 1939 (most sources, other pre-existing wars were merged into it)

+ 7 December 1941 (US with Pearl Harbor as start rather than just their entry into already extant war - the argument being that it became a *world* war rather than a *regional* war only when the addition of US and Japan meant the war was being fought across multiple regions)

+ 22 June 1941 (Great Patriotic War, similar argument to the US, but that simply having a substantially different second front in Europe was enough, given that it was enough for WW1)

+ 30 November 1939 (if you count the Winter War between USSR and Finland as being a constituent component of WW2, but this one's rare because 1 September is earlier than this)

+ 7 July 1937 (if you assume that the Second Sino-Japanese war was subsumed by WW2 rather than simply replaced by it)",False,1654386712.0,t3_v4goca,t1_ib726c0,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

Russia started with more weapons, more troops, more equipment, more strength, but Ukraine has managed to push them to nearly a stand-still. Now Ukraine has even been pushing them back (last 24 hours), although this will change on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, Russia has been hit with sanctions (reducing economy, making it hard to resupply), while Ukraine has had increasing support with supplies from the rest of the world.

Ukraine still has less weapons, but they're becoming more advanced. Ukraine has more troops being trained.

To get an idea of how the war is going right now, you need to look at two locations:

1. Severodonetsk (Russian main offensive). Russia allegedly took most of the city yesterday, and Ukraine allegedly took most of it back today. It will probably go back-and-forth for a while. See who controls it in a week.



2. Kherson (Ukrainian main counter-offensive). Ukraine is trying to push to reclaim a significant area there (West of the river), so if they can take Kherson, it's a significant victory for them. They're currently moving closer (allegedly), and cutting off Russian reinforcements in the area.

Ukraine has said it will be another few weeks before they have enough strength to counter-attack, so this is when we'll really know how the future might look.

> Macron is a big fan of Putin.

This is subjective. I know following these threads a lot of people have been surprised at how Macron has spoke about Putin. I know I have been, I thought the rhetoric might change a big after he won the election but it really hasn't. At a minimum I think most can agree he has been more charitable to Putin than most other world leaders. 

> Has him on weekly phone calls

Exaggeration here but clearly Macron has spoken to Putin the most out of the Western world leaders. At a minimum dozens of hours while a lot of other leaders refuse to even speak to him. 

> recommends Ukraine gives up its lands

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this in an interview, I guess you think he is a liar?
Zelenskyy put this out in public so France would stop pressuring them to make concessions behind the scenes.

The javelins being given to Ukraine are being used for exactly what they were made for - blowing up Russian tanks. Why does the US stockpile these weapons? To fight near peer adversaries.
