> For land based invasion like this, isn't speed of the supply vehicle mostly irrelevant as long as it actually gets to the place it needs to?

The total flow of supplies is what you care about. Trucks generally have a maximum size that's relatively easy to reach, as such decreasing travel time (either by having a shorter distance or increased speed) will be your most important factor when considering supply capabilities.

The usual napkin math goes like this. Assume it takes half an hour to load/unload a truck. If your supply route takes the truck an hour to traverse, then you have 2 hours of transit and 1 hour for loading/unloading. The same truck can then make approximately 8 trips per day, changing out drivers and such. Double the distance so now instead of 3 hours per round trip, you're taking 5 hours. Now you're at 4-5 trips a day.

Reloading the Russian's MLRS system consumes an entire truck. This means that if you have a single truck devoted to supplying a single launcher, the further away you get from your supply area, the fewer times your launcher can fire. Worse for Russia, they don't have a 1:1 ratio of trucks to launchers. It's something ridiculous like 1:5, and that's when their opponents aren't bombing the trucks every chance they get.

Furthermore, some supplies are continuous-consumables, like fuel. If you have a surface-to-air missile system with associated radar set up, it's running its engine 24/7 to power the radar. There's a point where the distance from your supply area is so great that a single fuel truck cannot keep your radar supplied with enough fuel to last the round trip of the fuel truck. Now, that single example is an exaggeration because that would almost certainly be measured in terms of a few days worth of travel, but those radars are not the only vehicles that need to remain on/idling for substantial periods of time. Some vehicles need to be kept above certain temperatures to ensure quick-start operation in case your unit comes under attack. Given how cold it is in Ukraine right now, that's a not inconsiderable fuel expense, just keeping parked vehicles warm.",False,1647287137.0,t3_te5lwh,t3_te5lwh,,0,270,0,270,0,0,

Reddit is no longer working for me today without a VPN, but there is some good news.

One girl, an employee of Channel 1 (the main TV media outlet that spreads Kremlin propaganda) today jumped out during a live broadcast right behind the host's back with a poster NO WAR, don't listen to Putin's propaganda, they lied you. Before that, she recorded a video where she said that her father is Ukrainian and her mother is Russian (a frequent situation here) and she is very ashamed that she has been working on state TV as a producer for the past few years helping the authorities to spread lies.  

She was, of course, immediately taken away, most likely to be jailed for the maximum 15 years. But it was live, it can't be cut or deleted! I'm proud to be Russian because there are people like her in our country!

As a German, our history has basically taught us that, no, you are not simply absolved for standing by and closing your eyes. Yes, the truth is hard to come by at times, but there usually are avenues. The feigning of ignorance of Nazi atrocities after WW2 by the German populace was mostly unfounded. Sure, the exact extent was often not known, necessarily, but people talked, people saw others disappear without a trace, people *knew*.

The main thing that kept people in line was a mixture of fear and stubborn ignorance of visible facts. Many were absolutely drunk on the prospect of a renewed, powerful, hegemonic Germany after they felt ""humiliated"" by the loss of WW1. I think a large part of the Russian populace is feeling the same kind of drunken fervour with Putin, who is trying to sell them the dream of a newly powerful Russia that is the master of the ""Russian World"" after the dissolution of the USSR and the total descent from former power during the free market ""shock therapy"" reforms and oligarchs seizing power.

To some degree, yes, the lack of information can be counted as absolving at least some of the responsibility, a few people genuinely aren't in a position to know better. But it is not as absolving as some people think. To believe the lies and not to question narratives like that, you need to be drunk on jingoism and revanchism to a degree. It still takes effort to just deny the cracks in the propaganda. Remember the reports of people in Ukraine reaching out to friends and relatives in Russia, some of which just outright denied the first-hand accounts of their friends are true. Stuff like that not making you doubt only works if you are basically letting yourself be ignorant.

Russians standing up to protest under those repressive conditions are heroes, and we shouldn't be baited by descending into anti-Russian racism. This is not something that is just Russian, this can happen for any nation, and currents of this exist everywhere. But do not absolve the ""average Russian"" from their responsibility to take seriously the cracks in the official narrative.

Day 19 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today wasn’t even remotely quiet, started the day by waking up from explosions, and then we heard gun fight happening somewhere close by, the shooting continued for about 10 minutes accompanied by explosions and judging by the proximity of the sound it was around 1-2 km from where we are, we are still not sure what the gun fight was about.

Air raid alerts continued to go off the whole day and around three hours ago we started hearing the sound of aircraft flying close by with sound of explosions coming shortly after, meaning they were bombers as usual, this continued for many hours after, but right now it seems to be quiet again.

From people’s reports our central market was hit, as well as parking lot, electronics store and a supermarket, so much for those military targets. And what is the most infuriating is russians in comments everywhere saying how today’s Donetsk missile strike is inhumane and a war crime, while at same time they don’t care at all about people in cities under siege, in just Mariupol alone there’s been close to 3000 confirmed civilian casualties for fuck’s sake.

The shameless hypocrisy just drives us mad; they are fucking real life zombies, all they do is spout their propaganda while at the same time saying how it’s us that are brainwashed and that everything that we see with our own eyes in our own cities is fake.
 
Of course they would know better what is fake or not than the people literally living in the war zone, I just can’t understand how they can be so unfathomably stupid, people are being jailed just for saying that there’s a war happening and they still believe that everything their government says is true?

The request underscores the basic logistical challenges that military analysts and officials say have stymied Russian progress in Ukraine — and raises questions about the fundamental readiness of the Russian military.

One of the sources suggested that food might be a request that China would be willing to meet, because it stops short of lethal assistance that would be seen as deeply provocative by the west.

Highly recommend that you give this a read, especially if you’re concerned that China is going to assist russia, because even expertise inside China says that would be a really bad idea. 

Basically the article asserts that to align with Putin would weaken China’s position and lead to western containment policies against China, whereas they are also in the unique position to actually goad Russia into ending the war, thus demonstrating to the world that they’re a responsible global power that wants to maintain world peace and setting them in a path to build relations with the west. 

> China cannot be tied to Putin and needs to be cut off as soon as possible. In the sense that an escalation of conflict between Russia and the West helps divert U.S. attention from China, China should rejoice with and even support Putin, but only if Russia does not fall. Being in the same boat with Putin will impact China should he lose power. Unless Putin can secure victory with China’s backing, a prospect which looks bleak at the moment, China does not have the clout to back Russia. The law of international politics says that there are “no eternal allies nor perpetual enemies,” but “our interests are eternal and perpetual.” Under current international circumstances, China can only proceed by safeguarding its own best interests, choosing the lesser of two evils, and unloading the burden of Russia as soon as possible. At present, it is estimated that there is still a window period of one or two weeks before China loses its wiggle room.

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.


**In Ukraine**

👉🆕 Ukrainian officials say another American journalist has been injured outside of Kyiv. This time it's Ben Hall, a Fox News journalist

👉🆕 Presidential Adviser Oleksiy Arestovych says at a press brief that Russian troops likely to focus on Mykolaiv and Mariupol in near term

👉🆕 Ukrainian intelligence claims Russian army is deliberately destroying agricultural equipment in Ukraine and that systematic cases have been recorded in Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Kherson and Kharkiv Oblasts

👉🆕 Continued artillery and air strikes against Kharkiv as darkness begins to fall in the eastern Ukrainian city. Kharkiv's Mayor says over 600 residential buildings have now been destroyed

👉🆕 U.S officials assess that 100% of the 190 000 Russian troops deployed along the border of Ukraine before February 24 have been committed to the invasion, and that less than 90% of them remain combat operational. They also say they see no indication of Russian reinforcements being mobilized elsewhere

👉🆕 A significant Russian military presence has been reported in the Melitopol city center, one seemingly larger than an effort to disperse any potential protest rallies would likely need in the 150k population city

👉🆕 Further reports from Rivne say that the Russian air strike on the city's TV tower also killed nine people, with nine more wounded and that ""there are still people under the rubble""

👉🆕 Explosive ordnance disposal teams stationed at a petrol station in Mykolaiv have apparently had nearly 1 000 recorded call outs since the invasion began and they claim that the use of cluster munitions have been widespread in residential areas

👉🆕 Another alleged intercepted communication between Russian forces has a Russian soldier saying they will shoot all civilians ""children or no children"" after reporting loss of a 60 men company with only 7 survivors that fought Ukrainian volunteers

👉🆕 U.S Defense official say 50-60 Russian vehicles are bypassing Kharkiv city to try and cut off Ukraine's forces in Donbass from retreat. This is likely an indication that Russia is attempting to reinforce their assault on Izyum, a strategic road hub in the Kharkiv region which, if captured, would allow them to effectively encircle Ukrainian troops on the front lines. It's also likely that this is the convoy that's filmed while parked in Kupyansk earlier today

👉🆕 Ukrainian Army's General Staff say Russian camps have been set up along the border to house incoming Syrian mercenaries. Earlier reports indicate that Russia has already signed on several thousand mercenaries

**Politics/Diplomacy**

Tomorrow, the speakers of both parliaments will meet together with Swedish King participating, and on Wednesday the two countries' Interior Ministers will meet. Swedish Government has also reportedly invited all the Opposition parties this week to discussions about NATO

👉🆕 Slovakia expels 3 Russian diplomats from Russian Embassy in Bratislava after receiving information from the security services

👉🆕 U.S has supposedly told allies that China has signaled willingness to provide Russia with military support of its invasion in Ukraine

👉🆕 Russian Defence Ministry says its forces in Ukraine will disable Ukrainian factories that produce or can repair weapons. They also say they know all the locations of ""foreign mercenaries"" in Ukraine and that they will target them all

👉🆕 Russia signs agreement with the ""People's Republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk for mutual cooperation and intermingling of police work, which would then ""legally"" allow Russian police to operate in Donbass region

👉🆕 Ukraine's Prosecutor General says Kyiv and Moscow might negotiate a POW exchange

👉🆕 White House could be planning a Biden trip to Europe in coming weeks say multiple sources close to White House

👉🆕 Turkey's Ministry of Defence says that NATO is to hold ""extraordinary"" defence meeting regarding Ukraine on March 16

👉🆕 U.N Secretary General says today that Russia raising its nuclear forces alert level after invading Ukraine is a ""bone-chilling development"" and that the previously unthinkable prospect of nuclear conflict is ""now back within the realm of possibility"". He also says U.N will allocate another $40m USD in humanitarian aid to Ukraine

👉🆕 Ukraine's Foreign Minister spoke with his Portuguese counterpart this afternoon and underscored the need to speed up Ukraine's EU membership application after thanking him for Portugal's support so far.

From CNN's Natasha Bertrand, Katie Bo Lillis, Kevin Liptak, Kylie Atwood and Jennifer Hansler 
The US has information suggesting China has expressed some openness to providing Russia with requested military and financial assistance, a Western official and a US diplomat told CNN. But it is not yet clear whether China intends to provide Russia with military or financial assistance as part of its war on Ukraine, US officials familiar with the intelligence tell CNN.

The consideration was detailed in a diplomatic cable relayed to allies in Europe and Asia, according to the sources.

The cable did not state definitively that assistance had been provided. One official also said the US warned in the cable that China would likely deny it was willing to provide assistance.

The Chinese Community Party leadership is not all in agreement regarding how to respond to Russia’s request for assistance, said one of the sources. Two officials said that China's desire to avoid economic consequences may limit its appetite to help Russia.

“There is real concern by some that their involvement could hurt economic relationships with the West, on which China relies,"" said one of the sources. 

Officials are also monitoring whether China provides some economic and diplomatic relief for Russia in other forms, like the abstention vote at the UN. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping is “unsettled” by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in part because “his own intelligence doesn’t appear to have told him what was going to happen,” and because of how Putin “has driven Americans and Europeans more closely together,” CIA Director Bill Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. 

Officials separately told CNN that Xi has been unnerved by how the war in Ukraine has reinvigorated the NATO alliance.

Chinese leadership is also concerned because of “the reputational damage that China suffers by association with the ugliness of Russia’s aggression in Ukraine” and “the economic consequences at a time when growth rates in China are lower than they’ve been in 30 years,” according to Burns.

The US is “watching very closely the extent to which"" China or any other country ""provides any form of support, whether that's material support, whether that's economic support, whether that's financial support to Russia,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. “Any such support from anywhere in the world would be of great concern to us.""

He declined to comment specifically on reports of a diplomatic cable that the US had sent to NATO allies about China’s willingness to support Russia’s war in Ukraine.

If he is gone and the woman he ran against is declared president, Putin will be very pressed on a war in 2 fronts. But not only that, did you guys know on this very year there were protests in Kazakhztan that almost toppled the government and the president had to call upon an alliance led by Russia known as CSTO which is basically a big red button dictators have so Russian troops enforce their rule if they lose control?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022\_Kazakh\_unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Kazakh_unrest)

Maybeee, with some western nudging and if Lukashenko is gone those protests can be reactivated. Putin is already having a hard time in Ukraine, 2 fronts would be nuts, 3 fronts? I don't see Putin managing to continue the war after that. If this Ukraine fiasco ends up with the removal of his stooge in Belarus AND toppling the government of Kazakhistan, that will be too much for Putin to handle. And well... with 3 ongoing fronts now opened and maybe also some western nudging, maybe that Chechen rebellion against Russia can spark again? At which point you have a collapse of the USSR style crisis, Putin is done, and even the Republics inside of Russia proper might call for independence, though I wouldn't like that, since Russians deserve better and Putin is the one causing this mess. I hope Putin just falls and Russia manages to be a democratic still unified country.

But if the reports on the Belarus military are true, then cracks are already showing and this is where the west should pout all its pressure against. Putin can't survive failure in Ukraine + the fall of 2 allies that were firmly in Russian control, this is the point where the dictator begins to look weak and gets deposed. I think this is the proper way to topple Putin, which oddly enough, is also how some people argue that the Nazis could had successfully toppled Stalin, by making the republics inside of the USSR and the Ukranians in particular break away from Moscow, instead of killing them.

But the U.K government's offer is essentially to put any refugees on Universal Credit. I am assuming without the Housing Benefit element because one of the stipulations is that a host can't charge rent.

That is fine and all, I get that, but refugees to the U.K should be allowed Housing Benefit to put towards any accommodations suitable.

It's okay for Benedict Numberbatch to go on TV and claim he is going to host, but he doesn't have the bills a regular Brit has.

To be honest, half of me is put off hosting, only because there are probably more financially stable people to host, which I would rather admit to myself, than rub my own ego by fooling myself I could offer some sort of financial semblance, even for the short term.

Truth be told, chances are you'd be hosting a small family, whose father figure could well be in direct conflict at any given moment. They may even have PTSD. 

I fear some folk in the U.k would offer up for the wrong reasons and that is what is making the other half of me yearn to host, because I kind of feel that I am a realist, and in reality, a host would be a person who can offer a family some kind of semblance of normal life in what is, a foreign country. Not a makeshift parent? A host. Like in University. 

My own personal intentions lay somewhere in that, there's braver people than I fighting on a front I will never know. I will never see that level of bravery, but I think I could keep watch over his family for him for a bit until he's kicked Putin's arse.

I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to provide some alternative views to some common views by redditors I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.  
  
To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the discussion points below.  
  
Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…  
  
**View:** “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to organges.  
  
In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.  
  
In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.  
  
**View**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.  
  
**View**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine. As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.  
  
**View**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”  
  
**Alternative perspective**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…  
  
**View**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",False,1647286428.0,t3_te5lwh,t3_te5lwh,,0,12,0,12,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

#• BRICS - Association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

The BRICS states are an association for 5 major emerging economies around the world. The aim is to deepen economic, political and cultural co-operation between the member states. 

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

_Note: BRICS association could be one reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis_

#• CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/

#• Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

#• Putin contemplates invoking martial law - what does that mean?

Martial law essentially means the suspension of civil law and that the army or military bodies will enforce strict rules like for example curfew's or to prohibit big public gatherings of people.

Usually martial law is invoked to suppress people and prevent them from rising up and voicing their dissent with the current ruling party. 

In this instance it would likely mean that russian people wont be able to protest the war anymore without gettinf severely punished. [will be updated once we know more]

#• Estonia has voted to enforce a No Fly Zone (NFZ) - is NATO now at war with Russia?

No. The Estonian parliament was the first NATO parliament to vote for a NFZ, but this doesnt mean NATO is at war with Russia or that NATO actually has to enforce a NFZ now.

And what if Estonia decided to enforce a NFZ by itself?

Well, the NATO treaty doesnt state that members have to aid another member state in an offensive military campaign, as NATO is mainly a defensive alliance.

In practice, a member state cant act alone and drag the entire alliance with it - NATO would have to decide together for such a move.

_This aims to provide a short overview over these terms and maybe help understanding the differences - let me know if there is any other things i should add._

cbd993d6453d7eb2f8474365d6c700db,te5lwh,i0o7gda,"A couple of key thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. NFZ isn't ever going to happen.  Most everyone knows this but for some reason there's still folks asking for it.  Enforcing an NFZ means the US Military is immediately engaged in the conflict and shooting at Russian targets.  US jets can't fly without Russian AA being eliminated, so that would be first.  Then USAF would need to establish air superiority.  Thats US Forces destroying Russian forces directly is not going to happen without congressional approval, which itself isn't ever going to happen.   NATO won't commit to action the US won't back up.  President Biden won't commit to war with Russia without Congress.  Congress is unlikely to suddenly have a principled stand that means something on such a human history defining when they've failed to have principles when the stakes were much lower.
2. The math for Putin is still favorable right now.  Putin *still* can de-escalate and potentially survive at home.  He can hurt Ukraine enough that they agree to not join NATO and cede control of the breakaway regions.  Putin goes home, declares victory.  Russian economy is in tatters, but China won't want to be the only power facing a resurgent US/NATO/West so they will help Russia rebuild.  World will re-orient in a new cold war with Russia/China/Allied Autocracies on one side, US/NATO/West on the other.  Putin survives. 
3. If NATO were to attack(by point 1 being false) - Russian forces get completely decimated.  Putin can't survive this.  He will face the risk of getting killed or arrested at home to a coup so his only real alternative is to go all in with conflict with the West. That has to include Nuclear weapons, because Russian armed forces are no match for NATO.  Unknown what the outcome there might be - but not great for everyone on the planet.
4. Sanctions have been maxed out - sure theres probably some more things that could be done, but short of China and the remaining Russian ally states jumping in, there's not much more the west can actually do thats going to damage the Russian economy significantly greater.  This will also need time to play out.
5. US/NATO could probably provide jets and other advanced hardware to Ukraine.  Russia *might* respond - but most likely won't.  There's not a practical difference between getting missiles and drones, and getting MiG's.  All three help UKR defenses.
6. As terrible as it sounds, we do really have to sit and watch this play out.  Screaming for military intervention is childish.  Go volunteer yourself if you believe that strongly.  If you have any excuse for not traveling to Ukraine for fighting the war now, then you aren't prepared for a scenario where WWIII breaks out.  This isn't an insult - but in the west, we've been too conditioned by using US Military as a tool to go hurt bad people in far away lands without making any major sacrifices at home.  With this war, thats not an option.  Even if the war didn't go Nuclear, Russia and its allied states aren't countries that would just get toppled nor would Russians just stop at fighting in Ukraine.  As we've seen, they don't care about hitting civilian targets and they have ICBM's that can deliver payloads (even non-nuclear) all over the world.

First off, I’m not advocating for a NFZ, I completely understand the concerns behind one at this point. So this isn’t intended to be a debate about if a NFZ should be enacted. 

I’ve seen a lot of comments in many threads going way back that a NFZ would be used to prevent either side from flying over Ukraine. In fact someone posed a question in like thread 38 asking if it would prevent only the Russians or both the Russians and Ukrainians from flying. I posted that was a silly question and of course would only be for the Russians. Nearly every other answer said otherwise. Thinking everyone may know some NATO rule I don’t I deleted my comment. 

Reached out to a 17 year retired Army vet buddy of mine who was in logistics and part of his job was coordinating the NFZ over Iraq. Now, he isn’t a general or colonel or even in the military anymore, but basically responded - hell no, if the US military is enforcing a NFZ it is literally to keep the enemy out, why would they prevent local forces from flying?

But while I respect his answer, and agree, I know his opinion isn’t end all be all. 

My thought is if the US / NATO is taking the risk with a NFZ which will be seen as extremely aggressive, no way in hell they are forcing the grounding of Ukrainian planes also. But I could be wrong, it’s an opinion, with I believe some solid basis.

The bluff had to be played out seriously all the way to the top, since NATO intel seemed to know everything short of what Putin had for breakfast each morning.

It would explain why every Russian diplomat and Russian citizen doubled down so hard on the angle of ""Look how panicky and scared the West is, they are claiming there will be an invasion without any evidence. They clearly just want to hurt Russia with lies. They will look so dumb when invasion day passes and nothing happens!""

I think Putin got pissed when NATO called the bluff, and decided to turn the bluff into a real attack. Probably thinking that the act of preparing they had put on would be enough to win them the war, seriously underestimating the Ukraine defense.

problems and the last thing they want is to join russia in this war.

> GESSEN: So this analyst is Grigory Yudin, who I think is very insightful. And I think that he is attentive, right? Good analysts are - they largely earned their stripes by just really paying close attention to what is being said and done. And Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons for a long, long time. This is another strain of thought and action that we have observed over the years. Russia has changed its military doctrine to make it easier to use nuclear weapons. And this happened many years ago. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world, and in particular the United States, that Russia is a nuclear power.

>And, you know, I don't know that I agree with Yudin that the first target would be the United States and, in particular, New York City. I think that Putin is much more likely and has given indications on this and also seeing indications of this in the way that the Russian state television narrative is working - I think it's much more likely that they would use a tactical nuclear weapon to target, say, a military airport in Poland.

Not only has the Hang Seng tanked 20% since the start of the war on just the RUMOR that China might support Russia and therefore cause all Chinese DR's and DS's to get de-listed from the NASDAQ and other US exchanges, and not only will they get whacked with some level of sanctions, and the market losses will wipe out all those new billionaires that are supporting the party as long as they are prospering...

But Xi may also be terrified that, supporting an Army twice the size of Russia's with a defense budget  a quarter the size of the US Defense budget, getting involved may likewise expose just how logistically fucked China's army really is.... and then Taiwan and everyone else in the world is going to tell them to get fucked.",False,1647298222.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0obld4,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Of course she's going to talk and think like the majority of Russians and not be very alert to Ukrainian-oriented language unless her Ukrainian parent (can't remember if it's her mother or father) really emphasized it. 

As for the sign being in English, again, that's really common -- you see that in lots of protests in countries which don't have a native English-speaking population. She wants that image to be seen far and wide so that as many people as possible will know what she's trying to say, and many more people worldwide will know at least some English than will know some Russian. Notice that her message in Russian is clearly aimed at the domestic audience --she tells them that what they're watching is propaganda, and that they're being lied to. That's not something she needs to write in English because we already know this, but the domestic audience may not. It's a pretty well-done sign, she manages to convey two distinct messages to two separate audiences while using few enough words that it's actually legible.

Ukraine was struggling to control the COVID-19 pandemic even before Russian troops advanced on the country. It was slower to launch its COVID-19 vaccination campaigns than other European countries, and while the government encouraged citizens to get immunized, most people struggled to find a way to get the shot, didn’t feel the need to get vaccinated, or didn’t trust the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.

Just before the invasion on Feb. 24, only 35% of the Ukrainian population had been vaccinated. That puts it in line with most of its neighboring countries, although some, including Poland and Hungary, have achieved higher vaccination coverage. While different health systems and varying attitudes about vaccination in those countries are contributing to those contrasting rates, Ukraine’s relatively low vaccination rate could have implications for how large additional surges of cases, both in the country and in the region become as a result of the war. Like many other countries, Ukraine experienced a surge in cases due to the Omicron variant in November and another peak in the first week of February—most likely due to its low level of vaccination. By the middle of February, 60% of COVID-19 tests conducted in the country were positive.",False,1647304412.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0osbd8,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

First, Putin wants to rhetorically frame this conflict as Russia v. NATO/The West.  Regardless of any NATO presence in the war, Putin would much rather have them perceived as the enemy than Ukraine, which many Russians perceive as their ""Slavic brothers,"" of which Russia has a centuries old frame of being the protectors of the Slavs.

Second, generally in a stalemate there is a desire to bring more actors or more fronts into the war.  Perhaps, Russia sees this as an opportunity to bring some combination of China, India, Iran or Pakistan into an anti-NATO coalition.  Obviously, they can't all be, as India/Pakistan and India/China conflicts are likely to prevent them from coexisting in any such coalition.  In fact, there's a good number of problems with such a coalition, regardless of composition.  

However, it does not mean that Russia is not looking to re-establish the bipolar world of the Cold War.  While most rational actors would see China as the most logical rival to Amero-European power, many in Russian leadership still see themselves as the natural foil and natural leader of any such ""new Eastern"" bloc.

The two things complicating this are the fear that Putin is as ignorant about his WMDs as he has been about everything else, and the fact that this is a war for liberal democracy, which is a just enough cause given the alternative lately but the constituents of liberal democracies have certain limitations they have to abide by.  They have to worry about election years because those are largely free; death penalty and martial law is off the table; everything has to get the approval of the capitalist enterprise system which is only as useful as its transparency.  

At least in the past couple years - *finally* - the public acknowledged a limitation on reported speech.  We've learned to block the social media accounts of tyrants and would-be tyrants and label disturbing messages as misinformation with links to the real information without having to censor the whole thing, to lean on corporations to police their own, with mixed results, and to cancel the shit out of monsters.  It could be better - some networks have hidden behind our byzantine legal system - but it's progress of a kind, and the kind we need in an information war against state absolutism.

So even though the Russians technically have control of the air, they don't have the means to take full advantage of it.  Either they stand at arms' length and throw dumb munition haymakers that don't even come close enough to help their troops, or they come down into the dirt and get cut to shreds by MANPADS.  On top of that, the coordination between ground and air forces seem to have been lacking, due to some iffy communications.

That leaves the cruise missile threat, which is pretty hard to counter with air cover, even if you're putting up an NFZ.  They're probably running low in stocks.   Also an issue with NFZs are making sure the Ukrainians aren't targeting friendlies - when you don't have any allied assets flying about, you can be pretty damn sure that everything over your head is 100% OPFOR.

AMC, the movie theaters, are majority-owned by Dalian Wanda Group in Beijing.

GM. The car maker isn't *owned* by China but if it weren't for their partnership with Shanghai Automotive Industry Group (SAIC), GM would likely not be profitable. That reliance could be problematic.

Hilton Hotels is 25% owned by HNA Group, a large Chinese aviation and shipping company.

General Electric (Appliances). Chinese investor Haier bought the appliance division from GE in 2016 for $5.4 billion.

I remember digging foxholes in the woods behind my friends house and stocking them with canned goods and camping supplies provided by my friends father. I remember having nightmares in elementary school  about nuclear bombs going off outside my apartment.  I was too young to understand all the nuances but I knew Russians were scary and the world could end in a split second over nothing. 

And then, one day all those fears just went away…with the collapse of the USSR not only did we feel safer, but there was an optimism about Russians being our friends now. In the 90s, I had Russian friends in high school and started to understand that the average people of Russia were never the big soviet boogey men I was taught in the 80s.  My friends would go back and visit their families for hollidays, and I remember them taking suitcases of Levi’s jeans over there and coming back with suitcases of black market CDs.  I knew their economy was struggling but I figured it would improve and honestly I thought we must surely be helping them like we did with Europe after WWII.

It’s hard to imagine, but at least around my world there was a real belief that Russia would become this western style European democracy and ally in the 90s. I was still too young to really understand the absolute hardships of the first few years of post-soviet Russia, but by the later 90s I was starting to understand that the mafia was basically controlling the country there. 

I have vague memories hearing about the apartment bombings that would let Putin take power, but around that same time 9-11 happened and (its a cliche but apt) everything changed in the world. Over the past 20 years it seemed that Russia was rebuilding and prospering economically, but obviously the rhetoric towards the west was growing more and more hardline.

I would have imagined that the best way for China to play this was to stay neutral, wait about a year and then buy the Russian economy for cents on the euro. Meanwhile they just play the usual propaganda for their domestic audience reinforcing the idea of the evil west and the righteousness Russia trying to liberate a brother nation, preparing their own invasion of Taiwan.

Not helping the Russians now would be easily explainable to them and it's not as if Russia will have many other options for trade in a year or so. 

So the fact that China is inclined to help, even in a little bit, tells me that as long as it doesn't escalate, they are happy for a prolonged conflict in Europe. I guess they are hoping that it will force the EU/US to pour resources into Ukraine to the point where it's debilitating/distracting? But even in an insurgency type model where Russia has conquered Ukraine, it still really doesn't seem that there would be significant cost to the US/EU, and it's not as if field rations are exactly going to hugely bail out the Russians either.

Perhaps what it shows is more deeply an intrinsic wish to obstruct the west. That they firmly consider themselves to be in an antagonistic relationship with the west, including the EU, rather than in a (admittedly difficult) partnership. I guess if that's the case we can wave the multi-polar world goodbye and can look towards a new cold war for the coming decades. Still doesn't seem wise to do it at this stage to be honest, as they're not exactly in a position to take on the west in a meaningful way, and they don't exactly have made friends out of their direct neighbors either. Clearly their strategy has been one of patience, so why ruin it now by showing your hand.

Western leaders are not treating this as a defining moment that'll shape the world for decades to come; they're giving lipservice to the expected slogans of 'freedom will win.'

If Russia takes Ukraine, that's a vice grip on European energy; there may be years of condemnation against Russia, but necessity will drive nations back. Even if Putin does not live to see his plan to fruition, any pain Russia suffers now, is worth the cost - that may be his legacy. 

If Ukraine maintains the coasts and developing oil projects, and ascends to the EU, Russia becomes irrelevant to the west.

Estonian could try to implement a no fly zone on their own if they want. That would mean a) trying to use surface to air missiles from their own country, and firing them at moving targets 1000km away (and over Belarus/Russia, hostile countries), and b) flying manned air missions to 1000km away over hostile country with the specific intent of shooting down Russian planes if they see them.

If they did this they would fail logistically. And they would invite an attack (dead pilots, bombed airfields, demolished SAM sites) that NATO would be unable to defend. Russia would (rightly) call them a rogue state of NATO and may seek to ""demilitarize"" them too. This would put NATO in the position of having to decide if it is worth it to go to war over the invasion of NATO country that attacked Russia on their own. If they do, it's WWII with Russia.

No, there's still more on the table. I can't find the source but there was an US official that was quoted today saying stuff like denying Russian ships access to US waters and some other stuff was still being considered.

Maybe, but it seems firmly ruled out.

> Screaming for military intervention is childish.

Equally, depicting those who out of kind-heartedness want to relieve the suffering of Ukrainian civilians as screaming children, is cold and heartless. It's a perfectly reasonable response for a normal human being, and quite frankly there is an argument to be made that a limited NATO response that does not include putting boots on the ground or threatening Russia significantly (such as a no-fly zone) would with a very high degree of certainty not escalate into a nuclear war, as is evidenced by Russia's nuclear doctrine and direct statements from Putin in the past. Putin never intended to be in this situation, nor does he have a desire for nuclear war, nor can he achieve his goals with nuclear war, and there is plenty of evidence that he is intrinsically a cowards. We are talking about 44 million people here, and *some* degree of risk to help them must be borne by a moral society. Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating for direct involvement. I'm just saying that depicting those who are as being unwise and naive is a cheap and unkind way of reasoning, that serves only to elevate yourself by comparison and ignores a valid and rational argument that is behind such statements.",1647296130.0,1647295757.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0o7gda,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The clamor for a NFZ is part of the negotiation. It's a tactic. 

No math is stable for Putin. He's set his people back decades. He has successfully stigmatized his whole nation. There are plenty of Russians citizens and expats around the world. Those that are not overwhelmingly condemning Putin and his war crimes are pariahs. 

The West is engaging in a massive build up, including exercises along the Russian frontier. That and the continued logistical and humanitarian support is active engagement. That is not sitting and letting this play out. 

Sanctions are heavy, not maxed.

No one knows their true missile capabilities. Given the terrible ineffectiveness of the ground forces. The efficacy of which is obviously a direct result of corruption. Their missile capabilities are suspect at best. And that is part of the back channel process.

Of course there's others in positions of importance, but this is less of a government than Soviet Russia.

Then it would be safe to send in the jets and I'd shoot any Russian planes. After a day or two I'd win the argument and bomb any known Russian planes on the ground, whether they are in Russia or Belarus.

I'd concede a 'separation' plan for the eastern Donbas (under a UN observed de-militarised zone) if it meant that other parts of Ukraine are liberated from the invasion.

Russia is making a big deal of them but the reality is they're microscopic in number in the grand scheme of the military. The reality is if Russia would stop being douchebags in the east Azov wouldn't exist. Thing is Russia wants you to think they're so massive and influential to justify their actions. They have no representation in the Ukrainian parliament, that's mostly held by a different organisation called ""right sector"" and even then their representation isn't spectacular.

Note also that Wagner Mercenaries are effectively the same thing for the Russians, and they're unapologetic Nazis as well. While Azov isn't a great look for Ukraine it's absolutely false to imply moral high ground to the Russians.

For the (proto)-fascists in the US, they actually even wear their ideology on their hats: MAGA. The US has been losing superpower status in a more and more multipolar world and global economic crises are getting more severe. With that, old privileges are lost and the wealth gap widens.

Fascism thrives on that, the sense of humiliation from lost privileges and the promise of their renewal through strength. Fascism's main supporting body has always been a middle class losing their small amount of privilege and wealth, fearing both the people underneath them and the people above them. It appears mostly where a once stable status quo becomes unsustainable in deepening crisis, but prospects for revolutionary change are quelled by reactionary forces.

In the US, from what I can see at least, the narrative seems to be that some sort of ""wokists"" (i.e. minorities and leftists) are conspiring with/fooled by some sort of ""elite"" to create """"""communism"""""" by taking away the privilege and glory of Americans. It's not all that far removed from ""Judeo-Bolshevism"" inventing both Capitalism and Communism to keep down the good German and his rightful place on top in the classic nazi narrative, at the very least in structure.

First of all, the US/NATO have no jurisdiction in Ukraine. And sure, they could put in the no-fly zone at the invitation of the Ukrainians, but Russia intrinsically opposes the legitimacy of the Ukrainian government. So there is a dispute about the validity of such a request. So from Russia's point of view, the US/NATO have no business there.

Additionally, a no-fly zone specifically also means hitting targets inside of Russia such as radars and SAM's. So it's not just flying in disputed airspace, but hitting directly on Russian soil.

International waterways however, *belong* to someone. Examples are the Suez and the Panama canal. Importantly, we are not talking about ""international waters"", but waterways *between* international waters. So in those cases, the authorities managing such a waterway could be persuaded under US pressure to deny Russian access, to further hamper their economy.

I would imagine that one of the more salient waterways here are the Danish straits, which control the access between the Baltic sea and the North sea. If this passage were blocked it would essentially prevent Russian ships from leaving/entering the Baltic sea.

Essentially a no-fly zone is you denying your neighbour access to a part of the street, whereas blocking international waterways is you not allowing your neighbour in your home.

1. One of China’s main international positions is a “respect for territorial sovereignty”, a position they’ve even echoed here. The problem of course is that it also doesn’t believe Taiwan is a separate entity for itself, but on the whole they aren’t interested in just invading other countries for hahas. This conflict has also thrust Taiwan//China into the peripheral view, and once Ukraine cools off, I’m certain that a Russia-supporting China would have its ambitions in Taiwan questioned and challenged at every step of the way. 

2. That would be the case if Russia could successfully make the case for Ukraine (which it largely didn’t) and had a path to victory that could be attained even with Chinese help (doubtful). 

3. No, they don’t. We wouldn’t sanction China as hard because you’re correct in asserting that the economies of the west and China are too intertwined, but that doesn’t mean there are other avenues of containment that the west could use, not to mention that they’d be the sole power being contained by the west to this degree (implying that Russia’s ability to project power collapses after this, which seems to be likely).  They also have other internal problems that they’re juggling and a party election this year, and Xi could lose if a foreign policy decision now leads to further domestic instability, since China already has to deal with covid and a housing bubble crisis. 

4. The allies China has don’t give it the international clout in the ways that matter to allow it to defend Russia.

All speech is Russian.

Name - Marina Ovsyannikova / Марина Овсянникова

 What's happening in Ukraine right now is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor state. The responsibility for this aggression lies on the conscience of a single person, and that person is Vladimir Putin.

My father is Ukrainian, my mother is Russian. They were never enemies. This necklace I'm wearing symbolizes that Russia should immediately stop this fratricidal war, and our brotherly nations will be able to make peace with each other.

Unfortunately for the past years I've been working on Channel 1, spreading Kremlin's propaganda, and I am now terribly ashamed of myself for that. I'm ashamed for allowing myself to speak the lies from the screens of TVs. Ashamed for letting Russian people get zombified.

We stayed silent in 2014, when it all began. We did not go out to protest when Kremlin poisoned Navalny. We just quietly observed this inhumane regime. And now the entire world has turned away from us, and ten generations of our descendants won't be able to wash away the shame of this fratricidal war.

We, the Russian people, are a thinking, smart nation. Only we can stop this madness. Go out and protest. They can't imprison us all.

1. small pox and other diseases were weaponized by the former soviet union. The u.s. spends alot to get this shit destroyed. These things are really bad news. Like it gets out a bunch of people will die. But we didn't make this stuff.

2. You need certain pathogens to test whether medical equipment is working correctly. So you get disease. Use equipment. See if equipment detects disease. Test complete. Its still a bad disease but you need it for hospitals.

A massively bigger army stalling out against a much smaller army, and making very little actual holds, then it's safe to say that Ukraine is succeeding. They don't have to out-kill or wipe out every russian on their land in order to emerge victorious. They need to hold the russian scumbags at bay, while the sanctions throw russia into chaos, and hopefully lead to a regime change.

Seriously, the 'enlightened realist' viewpoint completely misses the point of the counteroffensive and defense by Ukraine.

They know what you mean, but not precisely what, but that’s just the point. The Q, the Q. They all sound the same parroting that stuff and we know it’s bad but they just can’t stop. Daryl does the 8 till 5 at the factory, comes home sometimes with his hands bleeding and tears in his eyes. Nobody asks him how he’s doing, but the Q stuff is getting to him, too. Not because he believes in it, but cause he doesn’t. Guy I know was beaten half to death for having the guts to get into an argument with the biggest Q guy in town. He’s quite high up in the chain of command. They don’t bother him - you know who. The Gatlin boys. They stay away from him.

The neighbour’s Q son, though, he’s just a small fish. He could probably just give up some day, and he probably will. Probably get a proper job some point. I think he’s considering going to college, but he’s 32 now. People grow up slower here, anyhow. I knew a guy who didn’t run the liquor store till 40. He gets it done now. They all say that: Jack gets things done! It’s a big phrase around here. I don’t think he’s for or against Q, but it don’t matter. Nothing matters, really. I don’t think anybody here even votes,

The neighbour, though, he’s been talking to his son and the Q got him, too. He’s sick from it. He argues till he’s blue in the face. He knows the Q is crap, but he loves his son and he can’t give up. No, sir. He can’t give up. He wants his son to just get ahead. He wants him to get out of his no good place. My grand daddy was the nicest man I ever met - he stayed out of all this politics stuff, but he helped who he could. He was no commie, but he gave food to the homeless and he did a damn good job, too. He was a happy man, so we thought, but his last words were about regret. He didn’t say what he regretted, but there was regret. Marge swings in her chair all day. She keeps knitting. I think she knows about his regret. She is just as nice as she is. Everyone around here loved those two - even the Qs. I think they were gonna bring them all back to reality, but it was too late and they were too far gone, and now the only way out is to admit their mistake. To admit the shame. The regret. They know about the regret. I do, too.

A bit about me: they don’t know that I can think but I can do it. I fell pretty damned hard when my shares crashed, and I took a big blow to the thinker. It isn’t good, but I was getting ahead and I was making it out like the best of them. I see what they say about us. I can hear them, and I can understand them, but I can’t communicate to them. I can type, but I can’t tell. I just got some damage. Broca, they tell me. Somewhere in the thinker. So you can’t tell, but you can take in. You can’t broadcast, but you can receive. I hope to go back to normal, but I can’t and I ain’t. I feed the horses. They are so nice. I think they can understand what it is all about. Life.

2. Even if he does give the order, he's not popular in his chain of command. There's a reason he sits so far away from his own generals whenever he meets with them. The order to nuke has to go through that chain of people who hate him and also don't want to get nuked.

3. NATO has the best intelligence in the world. The closest we have ever gotten to nuclear warfare was the Cuban Missile Crisis - and they aren't even saying we're at that level of crisis yet.

With all that said, I know, firsthand, that sometimes anxiety is difficult to reason with. Anxiety can be illogical. Social media certainly doesn't help. If you feel like your anxiety gets out of control, I'm gonna strongly encourage you to ask an adult you trust for help. It could be a guidance counselor, a parent, or a teacher. For me, it was my mom, and everything got way better for me after she got me into therapy. If you're in a situation where you feel like you don't have an adult to trust, feel free to shoot me a message and I can help you find some resources.",False,1647306697.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0ottjq,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Sanders also said the following in the same speech. 

> M. President, I believe that we must vigorously support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to deescalate this crisis. I believe we must reaffirm Ukrainian independence and sovereignty. And we must make clear to Putin and his gang of oligarchs that they will face major consequences should he continue down the current path

> M. President, we should be absolutely clear about who is most responsible for this looming crisis: Russian President Vladimir Putin. Having already seized parts of Ukraine in 2014, Putin now threatens to take over the entire country and destroy Ukrainian democracy. There should be no disagreement that this is unacceptable. In my view, we must unequivocally support the sovereignty of Ukraine and make clear that the international community will impose severe consequences on Putin and his fellow oligarchs if he does not change course.

China can commit genocide and that's not gonna stop western consumers buying their goods, because the majority of western consumers don't have the privilege of being able to afford to pay more for niche domestically produced items. Consumers look at the price tag first, not the tag stating where it was made. Same can be said for manufacturing companies who increase their profit margins by exporting manufacturing to China. They're not gonna upend their entire manufacturing programs for a war that's likely to be over within the year. Especially in America where the current president isn't nearly as anti-china as the last guy. At least with trumps ""made in america"" campaign companies could rely on incentives and support domestically.

 >The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany began with the German annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938, continued with the creation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and by the end of 1944 extended to all parts of Czechoslovakia. Following the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany in March 1938 obtained with the Munich Agreement in September 1938, Adolf Hitler annexed the ethnic Germans living in Czech regions. The loss of Sudetenland was detrimental to the defense of Czechoslovakia as the extensive Czechoslovak border fortifications were also located in the same area.

It was carried out as part of the much broader action plan, the Intelligenzaktion, to eradicate the Polish intellectual elite, especially in those centers (such as Kraków) that were intended by the Germans to become culturally German. It is not clear if Sonderaktion Krakau (special operation Kraków) was the actual German codename. The reason for the detention was communicated to professors in the concentration camp.

b89db0a1fbe2cea25fc576195e8576ec,te5lwh,i0omco2,"> A ""proper"" fall from power in terms of a war?

There are more kinds of falls than just losing a war. The USSR's fall was economic/social in nature and not specifically tied to a general military defeat (though some military situations contributed).

> But wouldn't the loss of manufacturing and industrial superiority, and abysmal rank in education and incarceration like the US has seen be considered a proper fall from power?

The loss of manufacturing and industrial superiority would count as a fall if nothing had supplanted it from an economic sense. We don't manufacture widgets anymore, because we are basically the best at designing them. Our economy shifted from manufacturing to service. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, it has it's pros and cons.

> These things have impacted generations of people in ways that shatter hope for the future. 

One of the problems we have here in the US is that simply due to our sheer size, a LOT of communities were created based around single-industries. Coal mining towns, steel mill towns, etc. When the conditions surrounding these industries changed and those industries left for one reason or another, the towns no longer had any real methodology to acquire funds. No money is flowing in, and what money is there generally flows out. The logical action would be to leave the town and go somewhere else, but instead many choose to stay and rage at the world. Their town was once prosperous, and now it isn't, through no fault of the towns.

But this sort of thing happens for all sorts of reasons. Over the last 100 years, dozens/hundreds of mining towns had their mine close, not because the company left but because the mine dried up and wasn't worth further investment. Steel mills closed because their older technologies were not as efficient as newer ones, meanwhile the geographic rationale for its location may well have changed (on a particular river or in a particular space because it was collocated next to various mines in their prime). New mills were opened elsewhere with newer cost effective technologies, located near newer mines that weren't nearly so tapped out.

The world is a smaller place than it once was. Technologies that are a force multiplier beyond what even people like Henry Ford could have imagined are cheaper than ever before. Returning those industries to the US wouldn't help NEARLY as much as people believed they would.

Let's use computer manufacturing as an example with the Playstation 5 as an example. Modern factories for producing PS5s churn out just as many consoles per hour as factories did 10 years ago, and have a complete staff of ~12 people encompassing all three shifts across all seven days a week. 10 years ago, the same factory would have employed over a hundred people just for one shift.

Half of what these people are complaining about is a problem that the modern world is going to have to address sooner or later. There CANNOT be enough jobs to go around. Automation is too good, too capable, too cheap.

There are choices that will need to be made, the biggest is, do we continue to insist that if someone does not have a job, they should live a life where they are highly likely to starve to death or die of preventable diseases? Or do we accept that there are going to be people that will be born, live a full life, and die, and never work a single day of their lives...and that is FINE.",False,1647301550.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0ojxs9,,3,11,0,11,0,0,

Whether it's a point worth making is up to you I guess. 

That being said of course NATO getting involved in Ukraine, or even making gestures towards that end, is a threat to Russia's national security. The Baltic states are constantly under threat by Russia and one of the reasons is they're in NATO. Imagine if Canada and China made an alliance, and we had Chinese troops stationed all along the border. Hell we nearly started world war 3 because of missiles in Cuba. Now consider that NATO has basically absorbed more and more of Russia's neighbors over the years and did just that. 

Putin has far darker motives for invading Ukraine, but acting like there's no context here is stupid. He didn't invade Ukraine for one reason anyway. There's no ""this is it"" explanation. It was a combination of factors, some more logical (if cynical and cruel) then others, that lead him to this insanity.

It was intended that the five subordinate units, which were often referred to as battle groups (to distinguish them from traditional units), would be able to deploy and engage in operations more rapidly than conventional brigades, whilst also having greater offensive capabilities than conventional battalions.

So does renewables. Winturbines/Solar panels and everything else will wear out eventually. And my point is that nuclear is more reliable, more area and resource efficient than renewables will ever be. 

>able to quickly and effectively be valuable

This will always be the problem with nuclear, it has insanely high security demands, and is the only energy production source that actually has requirement for managing its own waste (fossil plants just spew everything straight into the atmosphere).

Nuclear has to and should always be state owned, and not a ""mechandise"".

>With the creation of power storage being a problem that is possible to overcome with steps being taken in relation to it already.

Yeah, there are many methods for doing so. But all of them also have massive disadvantages, and often requires a ton of resources themselves, or excavation into nature.

Some examples are obviously batteries, hydrogen production, water pumping, or other chemical or mechanical storage methods. Either way, everytime you decide to store energy it also means that it loses energy thats converted to heat. 

Like if you convert to hydrogen and back, then you have lost like 60-80% of the initial energy (I think something like that)


>Nuclear has a place, but it should not and cannot be the primary focus as it will take too long before it can actually fill the hole we would need it to.

Chinese view the Opium Wars as a massive stain on their legacy. The subsequent colonization of China only aided to cement racist views towards Caucasians.

Chinese are extremely anti-West now due to that, but are still pragmatic enough to chase economic success through the West. They hate them, but would gladly profit off them.

Ultimately, it is a race thing. Chinese see colonialism as racial oppression, and still maintain deep-seated hatred towards Caucasians.

Absolutely not. It took several days for the first round of truly heavy sanctions to come through, and it was specifically the lobbying and the very good PR the Ukrainians managed to produce that enabled this. Germany, Hungary and Italy were teetering for quite a while and without popular support of those sanctions the governments could have very well wavered. Populations over Europe were seeing pictures of Ukranians returning to fight with fear in their eyes, were being inspired by Zelenskyy's ""I don't need a ride, I need ammunitions"" before those sanctions hit. If the Ukrainians had reacted differently, so would the rest of Europe. Additionally, the full scope of the sanctions, including the freezing of the central bank assets, took even longer. Had Russia been able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv that would have publicly stated that there was no problem with a relatively bloodless campaign, it would have taken the wind out of the sales of the west.

> And if they had any possibility of enacting the sanctions before the invasion, they surely could have explicitly threatened them before. If they jumped the gun, every Chinese asshole would still be saying “they were only exercises” and the sanctions would be “unfair”. Now cause and effect are clear: You do X, we do Y. You stop X, we stop Y. Plus, lots of countries run controversial “exercises” and it would be problematic to set a precedent for punishing exercises.

The point is that sanctions are not a deterrent if the act has already happened. And sure, there would have been downsides to that as well, but on the balance of things, sanctions after the fact don't really change the fact. Putin thought the sanctions would be light and he would basically get away with it. If the West had sanctioned him more heavily before the invasion, he would have understood the true price and could have retreated without loss of face.",False,1647303855.0,t3_te5lwh,t1_i0oo9c7,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

1. I used to believe that there were more good people than bad. I was mistaken. Mathematically it seems to work out to 33% evil, 33% apathetic and 33% good. That might be something that's worked into our genes the same way gender is randomized so it turns out somehow 50/50 on average. I don't know how.
2. I used to have much more faith in humanity's ability to reason and preserve itself, but COVID taught me to not underestimate ignorance and confirmation bias.
3. People can be deeply stupid, me always giving someone the benefit of the doubt as to them having a certain fund of knowledge and a certain sense of reason has been proven to be dead wrong. For those who want to blame and be spoon fed, they aren't going to do anything but behave confused and helpless. Waste of time to engage.
4. Engaging with 'the enemy' is useless. If you're a good person, try to persuade a neutral person, not an evil person. Disconnect from evil people. On here I am not going up against 'evil' directly, block and move on. I speak to those who are reasonably trying to make up their minds. If I engage with someone who is dead, flat wrong, maybe someone else is reading.
5. This is a lifelong thing, my father's advice: ""If you need directions, ask five people and take the average answer."" To put that in 'information gathering' terms, find credible sources and then verify them when possible.

The cable did not state definitively that assistance had been provided. One official also said the US warned in the cable that China would likely deny it was willing to provide assistance.
Among the assistance Russia requested was pre-packaged, non-perishable military food kits, known in the US as ""meal, ready-to-eat,"" or MREs, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The request underscores the basic logistical challenges that military analysts and officials say have stymied Russian progress in Ukraine -- and raises questions about the fundamental readiness of the Russian military.""

NATO implements no fly zone

China immediately interprets this as a hostile act and demands NATO de escalate while more visibly backing Russia.

Russia shoots down NATO planes bombing its air defenses, and fires missiles at NATO airfields launching the planes (worth mentioning at this point the situation is completely unstable and unpredictable)

NATO establishes air superiority and achieves NFZ. Ukrainian forces start to make significant gains against Russia in Ukraine. 

Russia launches a low yield nuke against a NATO airfield with the intent to shock and de escalate.

NATO either chooses to de escalate, or responds with a low yield nuke against a Russian military base near Ukraine
