Day 92 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was a horrible day, shelling started around 10 AM and it didn’t stop for many hours, air raid and artillery alerts were active for 7 hours straight, it was very loud around my area too. This shelling was one of the deadliest in a long time as well; they killed 9 people, including a 5 months old child along with his father, and injured 19 more people. People let their guard down, because it was relatively quiet for some time, and that is when they shelled a crowded area, some people died when they were running for the shelter.

What especially infuriates me, is that all the Russians we know, and just all the Russians that we see everywhere in general, keep saying that “the west is trying to turn us (Ukrainians and Russians) against each other” What the fuck does that even mean? Russians are literally killing our people, destroying entire cities and saying “why do you hate us?” 

How can they be so blind? It’s completely incomprehensible to me, they are making us hate them with their own hands, but somehow “the west” is to blame for it? What did “the west” even do to them that they hate it so much?

From CNN's Ellie Kaufman

There are now 110 operational Russian battalion tactical groups (BTGs) inside of Ukraine, which is an increase from 97 BTGs the US assessed were inside of Ukraine as of May 9, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday. That is an increase of about 13 BTGs in about two and a half weeks. 

“The largest contingent remains in the south. But the western grouping, the central grouping and the eastern grouping each have roughly the same number of BTGs inside Ukraine,” the official said.
Russian forces have made “some incremental gains” in their push towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the official added, “not a lot but some incremental gains.”

Around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, the US assesses that Ukrainians have “continued to push Russian forces further away"" in a range of “a few kilometers to more than 10 kilometers within the Russian border,” the official said, “so no major change there.”

Meanwhile, 85 of the M-777 howitzers that the US has provided to Ukraine over the course of the last three military assistance packages are “forward,” meaning they are being used on the frontlines of the war, the official told reporters Thursday. 

Out of the 209,000 155 mm projectiles that were promised to Ukraine from the US, 190,000 of them have been transferred to Ukraine, the official added.

 Nine of the 11 total Mi-17 helicopters the US promised to Ukraine have been transferred to Ukraine. The last two helicopters will arrive either “later this month or very early in June,” the official said.

US and NATO allies continue to train Ukrainian soldiers on US and NATO weapons systems outside of Ukraine, the official added. 419 Ukrainians soldiers have completed M-777 howitzer training, about 30 Ukrainians have completed the basic howitzer maintenance course, and another 17 have completed the more advanced 14-day maintainer course for the Howitzer systems, the official continued.

About 20 Ukrainian soldiers are completing the second iteration of the training on the Phoenix Ghost Unmanned Aerial Systems, or drones, that the US provided to Ukraine, the official added. 

The US is “also helping facilitate training” for Ukrainians on coastal defense missiles now that Denmark has agreed to contribute Harpoon launchers and vehicles to Ukraine, the official said.

“Some training that needs to be done on how to use the Harpoon was not designed for coastal defense, it was designed for anti-ship warfare, ship-to-ship warfare, so this is a relatively new application of the missile, and therefore we know they’re going to need a little bit of training on that,” the official said.

Abramovich is subject to sanctions by the UK government and has seen his assets frozen.

He put the club up for sale in early March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, saying at the time that it was ""in the best interest of the club.""

Abramovich has Portuguese citizenship and, due to sanctions, the government in Lisbon was required to approve the sale.

""Portuguese authorization is a result of the guarantee given by British authorities that proceeds from the sale will be used for humanitarian ends, without benefiting directly or indirectly the club owner, which is on the European Union sanctions list,"" the government said in a statement Wednesday evening.

""The national position has the assent of the European Union,"" the Portuguese executive added.

The UK government has already permitted the sale, which will end Abramovich's almost two decades as owner of the club. 

And on Tuesday the English Premier League announced that its board had approved the sale of the club.

The deal, worth more than $5 billion, will see an ownership group led by Todd Boehly take control.

Boehly has invested in a portfolio of sporting franchises, including stakes in the MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks.

>As a result of the beatings and torture by Russians, nine of Marunyak’s ribs were broken. “It was hard to sleep because of the pain. I was trying to do some exercises, to take deep breaths, but it was getting more difficult every day.”

>“The hardest thing during torture was not to lose my mind. Your body and your brain react in very unexpected ways,” Marunyak recalls. “It was very hard when I was put in solitary confinement. I didn’t know which day of the week it was. What helped me was concentrating on thoughts about my family, that I had to survive to see them.”

>While Marunyak was in captivity, Russians visited and searched his house several times. They took away everything, from their modest savings to food and socks. They also interrogated and pressured his wife, threatening to harm their children who live outside the Kherson region.

>Similar things are happening across Stara Zburievka and elsewhere in the region, Marunyak said. Russians are going door-to-door, hunting and kidnapping Ukrainian officials, activists, journalists, veterans of war in Donbas and even people who rented their houses to Ukrainians soldiers of the 57th Infantry Brigade, which was stationed in the Stara Zburievka village before the Russian invasion.

Two captured Russian soldiers have been shown pleading guilty in court in the second war crimes trial to be held in Ukraine.

The two artillerymen, Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov, are accused of violating the laws of war by shelling a town, and prosecutors want to jail them for 12 years. The shelling destroyed an educational establishment in Derhachi, prosecutors say.

""I am completely guilty of the crimes of which I am accused,"" Bobikin told the court in Kotelva, Poltava region, according to Reuters news agency. ""We fired at Ukraine from Russia.""

Ivanov said: ""I repent and ask for a reduction in the sentence.""

A defence lawyer asked for leniency, saying the soldiers had been following orders.

There was no immediate comment on the case from Russian officials.

A final verdict is expected on 31 May.

Earlier this week, a court in the capital Kyiv jailed a Russian tank commander for life for killing a civilian at the first war crimes trial since the invasion.

“We expect the impact on the US and the global economy to be minimal, given Russia has already been isolated financially,” White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said.

“That being said, the Treasury Department continues to monitor and have conversations with global financial community.”

> Some pro-Russian milbloggers on Telegram continued to criticize the Kremlin for appalling treatment of forcefully mobilized Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR) servicemen–contradicting Russian information campaigns about progress of the Russian special military operation. Former Russian Federal Security Service officer Igor Girkin (also known by the alias Igor Strelkov) amplified a critique to his 360,000 followers from a smaller milblogger discussing a video wherein a DNR battalion appealed to DNR Head Denis Pushilin about maltreatment of forcefully mobilized forces. The milblogger blamed Russian leadership, not Pushilin, for beginning the invasion with insufficient reserves and unprepared, forcefully mobilized forces. The milblogger added that Russia did not provide the soldiers of its proxy republics with new weapons, despite claiming that Ukrainian forces prepared to attack occupied Donbas areas for a year prior to Russian invasion. The milblogger also claimed that the Kremlin failed to mobilize and adequately prepare the next batch of reserves, while Ukrainian forces are successfully preparing their troops for counteroffensives. Girkin also criticized the Kremlin for failing to pay the DNR battalion for three months. Some milbloggers claimed that Ukrainian forces staged the video, but the video still gathered attention of pro-Russian Telegram users.

Ukraine so far has proven to be very responsible in their way of conducting cross border attacks in Russia. Remember when they launched that daring raid in Belgorod, they didn't targeted a bunch of civilian infrastructure as a way to terrorize the Russian Citizens, no, they went for a specific target, a large fuel depot, a legitimate military target in the rules of warfare.   


There would be literally no reason (other than pure terrorism) for Ukraine to launch attacks against Moscow -or other large urban centers- using a system that was provided to them by their foreign allies. It would not only not achieve any legitimate military goals, it would likely result in Ukraine allies being more hesitant in future aid to Ukraine.   


But some may say, ""well Russia is bombing Ukrainian cities, surely Ukraine has the right to reciprocate such attacks right? ""Yes, but Russia can afford to do that, they have stockpiles of cruise missiles, sure they are burning through them fast, but the point is that they have a lot of them, and they can make more, Ukraine won't have that luxury, whatever they get will be of limited quantity, and future deliveries of more systems or ammo will depend on the will of Ukrainian's allies.   


My point is that Ukraine simply can't afford to do some of the things that are being hinted on this thread, and will use those systems to achieve legitimate military goals instead, like destruction of Russian supply depots, destruction of railway infrastructure, destruction of bridges etc.. those all have legitimate purposes in the conduct of warfare, as well as of course hitting the position of the Russian army directly.",False,1653614322.0,t3_uxz2q6,t3_uxz2q6,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

The military situation in the eastern regions is ""as dire as people say — even worse than people say,"" Kuleba said Thursday in Twitter live Q and A from Poland.

The only response that would work, he said, was with ""more heavy weapons. Without these, we won't be able to push them back.""

He called Washington's decision on this ""crucial.""

CNN has learned that the Biden administration is preparing to step up the kind of weaponry it is offering Ukraine by sending advanced, long-range rocket systems as they become the top request from Ukrainian officials, according to multiple officials.

The administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week. 

In addition to the foreign minister, other senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelensky, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometers — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a gamechanger in their war against Russia.

Another system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS.

Russia has in recent weeks pummeled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials have said.

The Biden administration wavered for weeks, however, on whether to send the systems, amid concerns raised within the National Security Council that Ukraine could use the systems to carry out offensive attacks inside Russia, officials said.

The issue was at the top of the agenda at last week's two meetings at the White House where deputy Cabinet members convened to discuss national security policy, officials said. At the heart of the matter was the same concern the administration has grappled with since the start of the war — whether sending increasingly heavy weaponry to Ukraine will be viewed by Russia as a provocation that could trigger some kind of retaliation against the US.  

Ukraine is already believed to have carried out numerous cross-border strikes inside Russia, which Ukrainian officials neither confirm nor deny. Russian officials have said publicly that any threat to their homeland would constitute a major escalation and have said that western countries are making themselves a legitimate target in the war by continuing to arm the Ukrainians. 

Another major concern inside the Biden administration had been whether the US could afford to give away so many high-end weapons drawn from the military's stockpiles, the sources said.

* This narrative of ""little Ukraine"" vs ""big Russia"" is flat out laughably wrong. Ukraine has not only one of the best armies in Europe, but its reserve, conscript, and informal soldiers give it essentially a million man and woman army.
* Russia, on the other hand, does not have this luxury, as its entire military is stretched across many areas such as the Karabakh, Syria, etc and these troops can't all simply go to Ukraine.
* Even if Russia mobilizes at some point, these soldiers won't be greatly trained/motivated.
* Russia's economy is crumbling and can't even afford to mobilize said numbers to begin with.
* The ""special military operation"" isn't very popular in Russia; it's about as popular as the Iraq War was in the USA.
* Even if Russia captures Donbass, what's next? Their resources are scarce, they've lost many elite units and individuals, are they just going to grind it for years?
* Ukrainian terrain past the Donbass is very favorable to the Ukrainians.
* Western resolve is strongly with Ukraine.

I'll also be the bearer of bad news, too. We talk about Russian losses, but we have to be honest that Ukraine has unfortunately lost many troops and equipment. Losing an industrial heartland would damage their morale. Their diplomatic position would also weaken.

With that said, keep in perspective. This is still Ukraine's war to lose. Hopefully, Putin's Russia joins the Confederacy and the German Empire as countries that collapsed during a conflict due to heavy sanctions/blockades.

The US has a bunch of different rocket types that can be launched from a HIMARS system:

* M26 family - 32-45 km range, drops hundreds of bomblets (basically a cluster munition), unguided.

* M30 - ~70 km range, also basically a cluster munition, guided

* M31 - the most recent 'basic' rocket, ~70 km range, a single 90kg (200 lb) warhead, also guided.

All three of those can be fired from the HIMARS in groups of six, and the US has fucktons of all of them. (In 2019, the US reportedly had approximately 33,000 of the M31s.)

The HIMARS can also fire the MGM-140 ATACMS rocket, but it can only hold one at a time. The ATACMS has a ~300 km range; earlier variants used a cluster munition warhead, but the most recent version (MGM-168 ATACMS – Block IVA) instead uses a single 230 kg (500 lb) warhead. The US has a few thousand of these, but stopped buying them in the mid-2000s. The replacement, the Precision Strike Missile, is scheduled to enter service next year.

If I had to guess, the US is highly unlikely to send any of the cluster munition variants. The M31 is the most likely to be sent, and it's possible that they'll send some of the single-warhead ATACMS, since the replacement rocket will be ready so soon.",1653607886.0,1653607621.0,t3_uxz2q6,t3_uxz2q6,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

The Russian Defence Ministry is promising to open a safe corridor to allow foreign ships to leave Black Sea ports. A separate corridor will be open to allow ships to leave Mariupol by sailing from the port on the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.

Russian Colonel General Mikhail Mizintsev, who heads the National Defence Control Centre under the General Staff, said 70 foreign vessels from 16 countries are now in six ports on the Black Sea including Odesa, Kherson and Mykolaiv.

Mizintsev, whose comments at a briefing in Moscow on Wednesday were reported by the Interfax news agency, said the corridors would be open every day.

Earlier Wednesday, the Russian military said Mariupol’s port was functioning again after three months of fighting. The Defence Ministry spokesperson said the military first had to clear the port of mines.

After all, Ukraine isn’t a real country, and Ukrainians aren’t real people. So they don’t have a right to fight against genocide.

In fact, it’s really rude of Ukraine to resist Russias totally lawful and righteous invasion to reclaim Ukraines land, because - let’s face it - Russia has the right to just kill whoever they want.

I mean, how dare anyone expose Russia as a bunch of incompetent criminals who’s only major export to the world is misery and corruption?

ESPECIALLY, when - you know - they don’t actually exist as a people.

Anyway, Russia needs more women. So it’s also reasonable for Russia to kill all the Ukrainian men and deport the women and rape them too.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that….

Your corrupt Russia deserves to sit in poverty and isolation for the next 20 plus years.

Your army is shit, and so is your culture. 

No matter what happens, Russia will not be allowed to do anything but lose this war in the worst possible way.

No off ramps. Just loss and poverty.

Welcome to your future.

What? Ukraine is already using NATO aircraft in combat, like the Turkish drones and the Switchblade drones. Do they mean fighter jets? The larger aircraft require months of training to use, so the delay there is more due to logistics than anything else.

We’re giving Ukraine artillery already. Ukraine already has M777 towed artillery, and is getting self-propelled artillery soon from France and others.

Last week Ukrainians filed a petition to the president Zelenskyy: [https://petition.president.gov.ua/petition/139292](https://petition.president.gov.ua/petition/139292) (in Ukrainian)

What's being asked:

* Repel border ban for men 18-60
* Revisit the mobilization process and prioritize volunteers
* Fight the mobilization and border personnel corruption

Justification:

* Ban is unconstitutional (debatable)
* Source of corruption
* Volunteers are much better soldiers than forcefully mobilized ones
* Ukrainians are free people of a free country. No need for enforcement
* Ukrainians outside of the country aren't returning because of the fear of being locked up
* Massive unemployment

I keep reading posts like this where it’s ten attacks in an area where Russia is focusing its resources and the results are something like 4 tanks destroyed. I realize tanks need infantry support but I would imagine Russia would be committing several dozen tanks minimum in a heavily contested area. I would also imagine these would be supported by at least a couple of thousands of troops, considering how many troops are in the east and the fact that they are concentrating their resources in one area. The daily estimate on Russian troop losses is often much lower than I expect across the board, which I think would translate to several dozen troops dying in the heaviest attack. 

Basically it seems like attacks are being repulsed with only a small minority of Russian tanks and troops being neutralized. So why would the attack fall back?  I don’t doubt that they are being repulsed. This has been verified in several ways and Ukraine seems to be generally holding its own, and the Russian army sucks, etc. I just don’t understand how they are doing this with so few Russian losses? 10 attacks with 4 tanks lost implied that the majority of attacks didn’t lose a single tank, and only one an armored carrier.

1. Using the US Navy presents a major escalation, plus it would be a violation of the Montreaux Convention to send US warships through the Bosporus when a state of war in the Black Sea has been declared and the strait is closed to all warships not based in the Black Sea. Turkey can send in its ships to escort the grain, but the US can't.

2. Ukrainian grain is starting to be shipped out via less efficient but secure ways, like via rail. Ukraine's grain is starting to be shipped via routes through friendly countries. Road and rail is far less efficient than by barge, but it is important the grain is starting to get shipped again.

3. The US is one of the biggest grain producers in the world, #4 overall for wheat and #3 for general food production. High grain prices are good for American farmers who were hammered badly in 2020 and 2021 due to some really extreme weather events like a derecho destroying crops and silos. The US doesn't want massive political instability, but higher grain prices right now while US farmers are struggling for money to rebuild after the bad years in 2020 and 2021 is a mixed blessing.

In other words, the most the US can do without violating international treaties is sell Ukraine the means to defend its grain shipments like anti-ship missiles. If the US really wants to, it could sell Turkey some new warships to base in the Black Sea, but that wouldn't make a difference fast enough to stop the current crisis. The other fast thing the US can do is send money and resources to speed up the conversion of Ukraine's rail lines so they are compatible with the EU's and equipment to protect those lines from Russian bombing.

If you want to look at it from a certain angle the West/US/MIC antagonized Russia into attacking Ukraine for a litany of reasons over time, allowed an attack to take place setting an expectation of inaction, and then changed it up by doubling down by breaking out the biggest war/relations efforts they could once Russia had fully committed itself.

Now to me, that ignores some really key things like changing in POTUS over that time frame, and doesn't give Russia enough credit for its own agency in its actions. It's not a Wag the Dog type situation IMO, but the culmination of decades of questionable and often contradictory policy.

But depending on how deep down the rabbit hole you go, you've also got a lot of complex issues around trust in the American center and left, and lack thereof between different stakeholders and because Russia is involved in so many different ways that you see a lot of frustration and emotional bleed between Russian involved issues.

People in general have a massive issue with things that seem like cognitive dissonance, and actively maintaining a sort of barrier between different, but related questions. Like trying to examine the tactical and logistical campaign failures that played a part in Trump winning is nearly impossible in some spaces because of a loud steady drone of ""Russia"" that drowns that and lots of other important discussions out.

Now some portion of anti-war center/left people see all this as a purposeful escalation with all that money we supposedly don't have to care for people in the US being found easy as pie as long as its guaranteed to go back into the MIC, with Russia/Putin being used as a convenient and sufficiently evil bogeyman akin to Saddam. 

Take all that apart and there is some truth in the constituent parts for sure. 

The Russian military reliably commit public war crimes, and we've seen it in recent memory. If you wanted a bad guy the public could get behind helping against, you couldn't have picked a better one from a comic book. 

There is also lot more opportunity for elected officials to profiteer with billions going into the MIC, and that's before you even get into the political palatability of arming the underdog against an evil war crime committing aggressive nation.

Winning requires achieving some set of goals.

At this point it is not clear what putin’s goals are; most if not all of his stated (for domestic consumption) goals are just excuses for the war. The chance of making Ukraine a vassal state has passed, forever. Militarialy russia appears to be now focused on a limited land grab, probably to enable stalling the conflict so putin can claim a “*victory*”.                   Ukraine obviously won the first phase as Kyiv and its sovereignty was unsuccessfully threatened. But now Ukraine has stated it wants all its territory restored including Crimea. Crimea in particular is problematic, putin (or any successor) is unlikely to cede it back as part of any peace deal. Taking it back by force is just as improbable.

Is either side winning? I don’t see it that way.

Russia could stop attempting to advance and declare the Donbas liberated, but Ukraine would simply keep fighting and the sanctions would remain. Therefore this tactic would be doomed to failure. Russia can’t win, but putin can’t/won’t capitulate.

Despite all of russia’s debaucles, Ukraine, in the short or even mid term, isn't in a position to take Crimea by force. Even a military recapture of all of the Donbas would take time and considerable cost of lives on both sides.

Both sides are losing:

Russia’s and Ukraine’s economies are being destroyed. It will take many years or even decades to recover from this. Soldiers on both sides are dying. Ukraine civilians continue to die, and suffer from war crime atrocities while under ruzzian occupation. A global food crisis may also be in the making.

No sweeping military victory is imminent, wars of attrition are very costly for both sides, I don’t foresee any off ramp acceptable to either side. Unfortunately, barring a redefinition of goals, this suggests that the war will drag on into 2023 or even for years. Label me a doom and gloomer if you must, but it is hard to visualize any potential resolution in the near term.

For some reason, Turkey is suddenly against Finland and Sweden. Despite these two countries discussing it for months earlier, Erdogan suddenly decided to veto it. While I suspect the Russians are behind this, I would just give him whatever he wants.

Additional aid to Ukraine, within the current framework.

* More heavy weapons, specifically artillery, and fortifications
* Air power
* Closing the loopholes that keep appearing in the sanctions--someone has to bully Germany into this 
* Ensure Finland and Sweden get into NATO.

Aid outside the current parameters:

* Destruction of Russia's Black Sea fleet, removing any blockade of UKR grain. If framed as a humanitarian act (cannot let poor countries starve), world opinion would be against Russia. (Let's face it, there's not that much left of that fleet anyway)

From wikipedia... *Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force. Once an attacker has lost momentum or is forced to spread out to pacify a large area, defensive counter-attacks can be mounted on the attacker's weak points, with the goal being to cause attrition or drive the attacker back to its original starting position.*",False,1653589748.0,t3_uxz2q6,t1_ia3gy1l,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

>While the police have broad powers to control protests, they must exercise them in accordance with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms sets the boundaries for the law of political protest and police action in Canada. Section 2 of the Charter explicitly provides for rights that contemplate political protest:

>\2. Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

>(a) freedom of conscience and religion

>(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication

>(c) freedom of peaceful assembly and

>(d) freedom of association.

>Peaceful political protest has long been recognized as a protected form of expression and assembly. Peaceful assembly and expression are arguably two of the most important rights in a functioning democracy, contributing to our aspirations for truth, self development and in protecting and fostering a vibrant community.

>Charter rights are not absolute, however. Not all expression is legal. Not all assembly or association is legal. A Charter right may be curtailed by the law when it is “demonstrably justified in a democratic society.” The Charter does not protect violent forms of expression or hate speech, for example.

That is to say, unless they break one of those rules (or Canada explicitly and officially recognizes pro-Russia sentiment as hate speech), they still have the right to peacefully assemble regardless of whether a municipal permit is requested, granted, or denied. That being said, pro-Russian demonstrations are undoubtedly very close to being considered hate speech seeing as Canada officially recognizes the Russian genocide of Ukranians... but unless Canada explicitly and officially states that a pro-Russian demonstration would be hate speech, they still have the right to assemble. 
  
Note that I agree in the slightest  with pro-Russian sentiments, I'm just correcting the notion that without a permit they have no right to assemble.",1653631678.0,1653615281.0,t3_uxz2q6,t1_ia4udi8,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

I also think that the capabilities of the Russian military are extremely lacking. It has been shown that a lot of their efforts in modernization and equipment where all squandered through corruption and lack of discipline. So the equipment and logistical supplies are shit and lacking. 

The basic soldier themselves are lacking of discipline. Just based off of the conscription service and lack of leadership. I doubt they would be the most capable at handling already inadequate equipment. 

Finally people discount the amount of time we have spent at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. This can be viewed as great experience on many levels.

Wheat fields? To control a decent size of Ukrainian agricultural production, they need to capture and secure most of the country, not just one region in Kherson. They need to be all the way to Lviv on the other side of the country.

Is it possible? Maybe, but not without total mobilization, a million man army and staggering losses.

This was a dress rehearsal, to see if 20th century military diplomacy can still work in 21st century globalized world. A quick operation in Ukraine before the west reacts would've given Russia the green light to act on its other interests, actual resource rich, not always friendly to Moscow countries like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan. Green light for China to act on Taiwan, complete subjugation of Hong Kong.

Russia ran on stage in this rehearsal, stumbled, fell over, got tangled in the curtains and is now flailing around to salvage the situation.

West already reacted, and even more united than I or some of my higher ups in my current field of work would've thought.

EU embargo on Russian fuels is moot point here, some EU countries can't just immediately shut off russian energy imports without a concise plan for the next years, possibly decades.
