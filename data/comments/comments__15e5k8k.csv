> - can't make sense of Russia's push in the Luhansk region. The terrain is really hard to overcome. claims it's doomed to fail, if they make any ""success"" they'd just bump into the oskil river. The densely forested terrain is difficult for offensive action.

> - claims the counter offensive isn't measured in KM, but rather in attrition of the enemy. claims Russia is losing a lot of equipment tying to constantly plug the line. Offensive hasn't reached mobile phase.

> - Russia is losing a lot of well trained troops, plugging them with mobilized troops. (this is what prigozhin also said about what happened to the VDV)

> - He says that during Kherson offensive they(ukraine) suffered major casualties in initial strategy of frontal attacks, and they switched tactics to dismantling of Russian troops in the area with superior recon, precision weapons, and high ground. (could be true as popov went public to say counter battery is messing them up)

> - says that 2 things will happen in the near future, collapse of russian defense leading to encirclement and chaotic withdrawal or russia will declare withdrawal similar to kherson. (not sure how far back or where based off the video)

> - says command has gotten much better, says one year ago it was very chaotic compared to where they are at now. Still much work to do, but improvements were made. (think he means it went from an D- to like a C.)

> - interesting he claims Russia's command and tactical ability has degraded, says they were much better organized during last years Kherson offensive. Says they are defending, but they are very chaotic and jittery and lack organization. Could lead to a major rout. The russian southern and western defenses may collapse. Says the clock is ticking for Russia to move to the pre 2012 lines where they would be better suited for defensive operations.

> - says russians are taking immense casualties in klischiveevka village, they have no need to advance 3km to quantify results on a map, but they are hammering everyone who enters.

> - cluster munition has made the first phase operations much longer which he says is a good thing because phase 2 will be a lot less costly on human lives. (this makes sense as to why zaluzhny said to gen. Mily if he doesn't get 100k shells he will lose a lot of soldiers)

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-31-23/index.html

""Ukrainian authorities on Monday morning reported modest territorial gains around the frontlines of the city of Bakhmut, as well as repelling Russian attacks elsewhere. 

""The Ukrainian Defense Forces freed two square kilometers (0.7 square miles) of territory in the Bakhmut sector over the past week, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said during a live broadcast Monday. That brings the total liberated area in eastern Ukraine to 37 kilometers 914 square miles).

She added Ukrainian troops are conducting successful offensives in areas south of the city of Bakhmut.

Maliar also said Russia “continues to focus its main efforts on the Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka directions, and heavy fighting continues,” reporting “more than 170 battles” in those areas.

Along the eastern frontlines: Russia failed an attempt to push Ukrainian troops out of the Serebryansky forest in the Lyman sector, while Ukrainian defense forces were “holding back enemy troops effectively” in the Kupyansk sector, Maliar added.

Russian forces focused their main efforts on attacks in the Avdiivka and Mariinka directions within the Donetsk region but were also unsuccessful, she said.

She said Ukrainian Defense Forces liberated Staromaiorske, in the Donetsk region, “under heavy fire from aviation and artillery.""

In the Zaporizhzhia region, Ukrainian forces have been “successful and are consolidating their positions” in the areas of Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne.

Since the beginning of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, 204.7 square kilometers (79 square miles) have been liberated, of which 12.6 square kilometers (5 square miles) were retaken over the past week.""",False,1690805479.0,t3_15e5k8k,t3_15e5k8k,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-31-23/index.html

""Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu says Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine in response to drone strikes on his country’s territory, including those in Moscow on Sunday.

“The intensity of attacks on Ukrainian military facilities, including those supporting these terrorist attacks, has been increased several times,” he said Monday.

Speaking during a conference call with Russian Armed Forces leadership, Shoigu said that ""additional measures"" had been taken to protect domestic targets.

The Russian defense minister also alleged that attempted drone attacks by Kyiv were carried out to deflect from what he said was Ukraine’s lack of success on the battlefield.

“Obviously, the supplied Western weapons do not lead to success on the battlefield, but only prolong the military conflict,” he claimed. “Against the backdrop of an unsuccessful so-called counteroffensive, the Kyiv regime - with the support of Western sponsors - focused on carrying out terrorist attacks on civilian infrastructure in the cities and towns of the Russian Federation.”

Some context: No casualties were reported in the attempted Moscow drone strikes over the weekend. However, Russian bombardments in Ukraine have struck civilian homes, schools, hospitals, churches and power plants, killing thousands of bystanders in the process.

Ukraine's counteroffensive has gone slower than expected, with Russian troops putting up tough resistance as Ukrainian soldiers attempt to break through the front lines.

Since the counteroffensive started, 204.7 square kilometers (79 square miles) have been retaken, of which 12.6 square kilometers (5 square miles) were retaken over the past week, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said Monday.""",False,1690805668.0,t3_15e5k8k,t3_15e5k8k,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

That is exactly in-line with the reporting I’ve read — and it is really confusing to me.  
  
If Russia truly has a ‘defense in depth’ strategy and they have a grey zone / trench line 1, 2 and 3, then trying to hold the line and counter attacking in the grey zone seems to be the exact opposite of what one would expect.  Trench line 2 is supposed to be the strongest, but I don’t understand how the Russians will have any real number of troops left when Ukraine gets there.

If we don't have the same turnout in 2024 that we had in 2020, we're all gonna be seriously fucked. For those that aren't worried because ""lol Trump has no chance"", think again smartass, because that attitude caused Trump to win in 2016. Want a repeat of that shitshow? Me neither. I was one of those smartasses in 2016. Hard lesson learned.

""But Biden won in 2020! Trump is done lol!"". Yeah, Biden won. NARROWLY. He won the swing states he needed by narrow margins. Look at these three for example: He won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes, Georgia by 11,779 votes, and Arizona by 10,457 votes. If Trump had won all three of those (like he did in 2016) in addition to the ones he actually did win, Trump would've been re-elected with the final Electoral Vote count being 282-256 (need at least 270 to win the presidency). If he had won just Wisconsin and Georgia out of those three, the final EV count would've been 271-267 in Trump's favor. If he had won just Arizona and Georgia, the final EV count would've been 272-266, again in Trump's favor. Let that sink in. Still ""lol""ing now?

Also, the ""Trump is going to prison! We got him this time!"" ain't gonna cut it for me this time, chief. I've been hearing that bullshit for years. If any of us did even a fraction of the shit he got away with over the years, they would jack up the prison, throw our peasant asses under it, and throw away the goddamn key. I'll believe Trump is going to prison when I actually fucking see it and not a second before. Don't bother trying to change my mind on that because you won't.

I have no illusions the Ukrainian army is some secret juggernaut that we just mis-judged.  The rot and corruption of the Russian Military is staggering bad.  They are getting drunk on the front lines and scavenging for food.  Their supplies have been dwindling from constant attacks and mismanagement.  All the while Ukraine is constantly being rearmed by the largest gun runner in the world, even if it's ""slow"".  I believe overestimating Russian defenses might be just as deadly as underestimating them.  Initiative is important and so is morale.

I just don't get it. Is it blatant racism? Is he bought by foreign money or investors? Is his current culture really that much of an echo chamber?

Russia is fighting an existential war. It became existential the moment they started it. It's a war they can't loose because loss would likely make Russia collapse further.

And to make things worse, Russia simply can't win this war. So Russia doesn't have that many opportunity left to prevent its total permanent collapse.

What remains is scorched earth tactics. They're hoping to wreck as much chaos around the world to force everyone else to collapse with them in hope that the Russian superiority will be able to recover faster than everyone else once the ashes fall down and have a new empire reborn.

Since before the War in Ukraine, Russia has been using immigrant to cause a migration crisis in Europe and to a smaller extent into America. Starvation and helping coup in Africa will be used to spark an humanitarian crisis in Africa and hopefully fuel mass migration to Europe which would be later used against Europeans to blame all the problem of the world on migrants. This would lead to have anti migration parties which also happen to be very Russian supportive to win some support as some people will amplify how life isn't as good as in the past and use that scapegoat... Meanwhile governments would be busy with the wars/coup in Africa, the war in Ukraine and possibly the upcoming war in Taiwan. 

In the hope that all countries foundation start falling and reverting back to more conservative (fascist) ideas... Russia will be able to raise back into relevancy while screaming proudly ""I told you so"".

That's my personal impression of what they're trying to do. In my opinion, that's some sort of weird projection that Russia would totally collapse if something like that happened to them. So they think that European values (or lack thereof by them) can't survive while the rest of the world will burn.",False,1690817608.0,t3_15e5k8k,t1_ju7lx3q,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

This is in large part due to the decolonisation where Great Britan and France (as they were the major colonial powers in Africa) didn't bother to draw proper boarders and respect the tribal communities in the African nations. Corruption is also a major issue in almost, if not all, African nations. This instability and corruption means that it is easy for nations such as Russia to make coups in African nations.

Geopolitical, these coups don't mean much. Yes, some African nations do hold large deposits of natural resources. Nigeria has oil, and I do believe that Democratic Republic of Congo holds some rare earths that are particularly useful in computers. However, most have little to no infrastructure, which makes it very expensive and difficult to extract these resources. And also, African countries don't hold much power geopolitical wise, because they are poor, have unstable governments, and militaries in poor conditions.

So long story short: Russia can make coups in all African nations they want. It won't really matter much. I'm not quite sure what they hope to achieve.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscow-says-700000-children-ukraine-conflict-zones-now-russia-2023-07-03/

> July 3 (Reuters) - Russia has brought some 700,000 children from the conflict zones in Ukraine into Russian territory, **Grigory Karasin, head of the international committee in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament,** said late on Sunday.

> ""In recent years, 700,000 children have found refuge with us, fleeing the bombing and shelling from the conflict areas in Ukraine,"" Karasin wrote on his Telegram messaging channel.

The US estimated in 2022 that Russia had forcibly deported at least 260,000

And this was all repeated in the most recent report that was linked by the OP, though that report attempts to clarify:

> “Since February 2022, the Russian Federation has received about 4.8 million residents of Ukraine and the Donbas republics [of Donetsk and Luhansk], more than 700,000 of whom are children,” the report reads.

> An “overwhelming majority” of the 700,000 Ukrainian children arrived in Russia with their parents or relatives, children’s rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova said without offering further details.

I’m definitely not conservative at all, I personally lean libertarian as I don’t think the majority of adults need other adults telling us how to live our lives. It just seems very strange to me. I was raised by an over controlling father who also played the “I pay the bills, it’s my house my rules” which is fine, so when I moved out at 18 and payed my own bills it was easy as to his credit he would never tell someone in their house or not related to him how to live their life. I feel that way strongly, how am I to tell any adult what they can and can’t do? While feeling no body should have the ability to do that to me. I don’t believe I said rich people don’t go to jail, i said they tend to not go to jail. Which i still haven’t been proven wrong on that. I could easily list 3 rich/ well connected people who didn’t go to jail for a crime you and I would have no chance but what’s the point as if you don’t think the rich and powerful live by a different set of rules idk what more I could say as that’s pretty common thing across the world. If I owe the bank 500k they are coming for me, if I owe them 500m they are going continue to give me loans. Cops are a prime example of well connected people not receiving the same punishment even though I feel like you should be held to a higher manner. I believe the best deal for the government would be some under the table, “trump listen we will stop pursuing you, but you can’t bring this to light and you can’t run for Presidency”. It’s not a perfect solution but personally i think it’s a deal that would in the end be healthier than any potential lengthy face off and I can’t see why the government wouldn’t love to drop all charges in the event he cannot run again. I know none of that would be “above board”, but this is such a unique situation I think alot of under the table deals are going be made regardless. I live in south GA, and voted for Biden. I personally hate that Trump pressured my state to “find more votes”, I’m glad the republican in charge didn’t fold like I’m sure many other would have. Seems like Arizona is still sipping the cool aid. Problem in GA is where the drew the voting lines, it limits the pro democratic votes.. obviously they did this on purpose but I was one of many that were sick of Trumps bullshit and the division it created on the nation. I do have a fundamental issue with both Biden and Trumps age as both are way too old to be running again. Biden looks way worse bc it seems Trump is still quick minded, even if he spews constant shit. It’s just sad the Democratic Party has no other good candidates as Biden has been in Washington for 50+ years, feel bad for the guy. He deserves to go retire to some ranch and life out his remaining life, him being president is still a major improvement over Trump as clearly he’s shown he’s not polarizing.

I could shut this all down right now, but I feel invested at this point. You are oblivious to your own racism.... 

I have never once assumed your ""race"", I'm just speaking to your comments. I don't know you, and you are quite literally JUST words to me, not a color.... Your comments are pretty telling of your worldview. You mention victim mentality, race, and how much you HATE white people..... At this point I should have just ignored you for race rage baiting, but honestly it doesn't change my view on the issue of racism whatsoever, so lets have at it! 

I have my personal experience and you have yours. We are individuals with CLEARLY very different backgrounds and upbringings. You are (in my observation) at least somewhat predisposed to have a negative view of ""white people""..... You've called a bunch of other commenters on this thread ""white people"" or ""must be white"" even though we are anonymous strangers, we MUST be WHITE because we disagree with your blind casual racism? I'm sorry to call you out like this, but nobody mentioned any other commenter's specific race before YOU did.... We simply talked about the issues at hand. Some of them race related? Sure! I'll give you that ONE win! We are talking about some serious race issues from one presidential candidate....... 

So why bring individual commenters race into question? Are opinions and life experience worth LESS than race? Is my opinion worth less because I'm a certain race? I might be black. I might be Hispanic. I might be white. Can you know for certain? No. But in your mind, I MUST be white. Because I disagree with your political beliefs? Can you not see how this is blatant racism? You DON'T know me. Yet somehow you are blaming my opinions being different from your own, because in your mind I MUST be white? I must be privileged and had such an easy upbringing and easy life because cops don't bother innocent citizens that have committed no crime? Did I mention white in that last sentence? No. 

Did I claim to be a victim of racism? Nope. I HAVE experienced racism, and that is no doubt! Just as I'm sure YOU have.... We ALL do in some form or another, but the difference is I am NOT going to victimize myself because of a 30 second interaction with some ignorant total stranger on reddit who has no clue who I am, what ""race"" I belong to or where I've been in my life...? The SAME WAY I ignore blatant racism to my face based solely on the color of my skin? This is the SAME THING........ I am just a genderless, raceless, anonymous person on the internet pointing out the ABSOLUTE HYPOCRACY of what you are saying.....

First of all, I NEVER said I was a victim? Just pointing out your hipocracy. I'm very firmly NOT a victim. Why? I don't let myself become one.

Your hilarious crap about houses in ""poor neighborhoods"" claiming it has something to do with race? Reverse racism? Laughable. Look at the violent crimes committed per capita in Lawrence Massachusetts versus Worcester Massachusetts. Similar race distribution? Yep. MUCH different crimes per capita? Yep. Yet somehow racism is making the housing market in Worcester worse? Could it POSSIBLY be that an identical house with identical acreage MIGHT be less desirable to potential buyers when the same house 30 minutes away has 70% less violent crime committed in the neighborhood?

Like maybe the majority of crime committed has nothing to do with police brutality or injustice, but simply violent crimes being committed amongst the black community against themselves? I hate to say it but honestly, you fall into a category of people who blame WHITES for everything wrong in what amounts to be a massive majority of black on black crime.
