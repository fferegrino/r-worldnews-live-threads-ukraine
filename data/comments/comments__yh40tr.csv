Ukraine has boosted the range and accuracy of its military arsenal with precision-guided rockets and artillery shells, weapons largely lacking in Russia’s arsenal.

""Ukrainian soldiers are taking out armored vehicles worth millions of dollars with cheap homemade drones, as well as with more advanced drones and other weapons provided by the United States and allies,"" the New York Times reports.

It is largely Ukraine’s growing advantage in the artillery that has allowed progress in the south toward the strategic port city of Kherson, the only regional capital that Russia managed to occupy after Feb. 24.

The current queue with grain has accumulated in the Black Sea since September, when Russia started deliberately delaying the functioning of the corridor and seeking to undermine the deal. Russia took the decision to resume its hunger games long ago and now tries to justify it.

Day 249 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another day with no missile strikes or drone attacks, so it was very quiet here. We did have a couple of air raid alerts, and during one of them Belgorod oblast was shelled, apparently a substation was hit somewhere, which led to some settlement losing electricity.

It seems that even though we haven’t had any missile strikes in Kharkiv in a pretty long time, they still continue in Kharkiv oblast. In reports from our governor there are almost daily missile strikes in Kupiansk and some other towns close to the Russian border, which they use S-300 missiles for, the same ones they were using to hit Kharkiv most of the time.

It could be that we are not getting hit with missiles often simply because they don’t have enough of S-300 missiles to hit multiple places every day anymore, so they changed their priorities, because they were using those same missiles to hit Kharkiv, and now they are being used to hit other towns in Kharkiv oblast.

Ukrainian grain exports across the Black Sea have come to a standstill again, because Russia has withdrawn from the grain deal. More than ten ships lay idle on Sunday, waiting to sail again, according to the agreement's coordination center in Turkey.

Russia and Ukraine reached an agreement last summer to resume grain exports. The United Nations hoped that this would be able to tackle acute hunger in Africa and Asia and that food prices would fall. Russia suspended the grain deal on Saturday after a drone attack on ships near Crimea.

The coordination center reports that no new agreement has yet been concluded after that and that therefore no ships will sail on Sunday. The UN fears a worse food crisis if grain stays out of many parts of the world and calls for the deal to be respected. According to Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky, the Russians are threatening large-scale famine as a result of this action. The deal has already allowed the export of 9 million tons of Ukrainian grain.

Russia blames the food crisis not on its own decision, but on ""reckless actions"" from Kiev. A ship was slightly damaged in Saturday's drone attack.",False,1667121081.0,t3_yh40tr,t3_yh40tr,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

Russian society has existed under brutal repression for centuries.  A key cultural coping mechanism is for Russian people to hold two truths in mind at the same time: there is the truth in public, and the truth in the kitchen.  These truths are allowed (in fact expected) to diverge to some degree.  Indeed, they are often completely contradictory.  That's just how it goes.   The public truth is uttered to navigate the oppression and avoid being brutally hurt, and the kitchen truth is convenient to making decisions that enable one to survive, and sometimes thrive despite oppression. 

This gives rise to what we call 'corruption' - e.g. the public truth that there are 100 fully combat-ready tanks in the depot, whereas the kitchen truth is that two thirds of them have had something scavenged.   The public truth is that the depot was audited and there are 100 tanks.  The kitchen truth was that it's much easier to agree with the auditor who signed off a year ago that there were 100 tanks than it is to actually inspect all 100.   And so on.

Sometimes we see both truths come out, for example when we overhear discussions in the kitchen (or intercepted telephone calls), by soldiers who nevertheless go out, man the lines and shoot Ukranians rather than their officers.   

Understanding this is key to understanding Russian media, propaganda and behaviour of Russians.  

The only way to resolve it is to get things to the point where the kitchen truth is ""safe"" to discuss in public, which is either a very gradual process over the course of years as public truths diffuse through the population,  or a very violent process. 

I suspect we are at the cusp of the kitchen truth flipping violently.   In order for this to happen however, it has to be ""safe"" for ordinary Russians.  It has to become less personally dangerous to speak the kitchen truth out loud than to say the public truth.

>The multiday trip, with stops in St. Petersburg and Moscow, amounted to the most senior congressional exchange between the two countries in years, and the first since the Russians undertook an unprecedented and consequential campaign to bolster Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign and harm Hillary Clinton’s.
>
>That interference remains the subject of high-stakes investigations in the United States, and it loomed over the trip. On the same day the senators met with officials in Moscow, the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report confirming that conclusions reached by American intelligence agencies — that Mr. Putin ordered a campaign to sow American political divisions, harm Mrs. Clinton and aid Mr. Trump — were “sound.” Its release was intended to drive home that Russia is still active in American politics, using digital tools to deepen the country’s social divisions.
>
> **In Moscow, the senators traded pledges to work toward better relations with Russian lawmakers and Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister.** But they repeatedly found themselves locked in tense disputes over the effects of American sanctions and Russian denials that they had meddled in American politics.
>
> **Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who led the delegation and is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, greeted the officials by saying that though two nations were competitors, they “don’t necessarily need to be adversaries.”**
>
> **“I’m not here today to accuse Russia of this or that or so forth,”** he told Vyacheslav V. Volodin, the Duma speaker.

The seek to divide within the U.S. and individual European countries, and also between countries in the EU. On this thread I see a lot of them using domestic politics. Usually it is Trump this or Republicans that. Why, how does that help? Look at the goals, in a thread about supporting Ukraine they can turn the conversation away from Russia rapes etc, and away from talking about helping Ukraine in a united way. That is the first goal. Second is sowing the desired internal division. If it is Americans supporting Ukraine, that is bad for Russia. If they can pit one group against another internally using politics, if they are lucky they might persuade one side to weaken support to Ukraine, or make it sound like one  side does not support Ukraine in an effort to make those on that side start to think, hmm my political side doesn't support Ukraine. I do what my side wants to I support this too. This divides the U.S. internally. Now you would not have America against Russia, you have ""this"" party in the U.S. against Russia. Now you have reduced American support for Ukraine at a political level within the U.S. People on reddit are very tribal, so it really isn't hard to drive the discussion this way and I have seen it a lot. The cancel culture bit is one such way of trying to appeal to the politics of some in the U.S. that helps the above. Note that not all influence efforts happen on line.

Any way. In this particular sub I cringe when I see redditors arguing about Trump, or the GOP support for Ukraine. Redditors can't hold back, they got to jump on this, their animosity is so strong they just can't put it aside. In many cases I would guess those discussions were the ones the Russians started for that VERY reason. Not talking about Ukraine, you are fighting internally, maybe then can actually gin up some support for that in one of the parties. I am a centrist. What I see in both party leaderships is strong support for Ukraine. My personal view is people should argue domestic politics in a non Ukraine sub because otherwise people are helping the Russians here and like minded places because taking the bait they put out helps operations, and redditors usually do. Stand united for Ukraine, argue our domestic politics in a non Ukraine sub if reddit really does want to maximize Ukraine support. Down vote any domestic political squabbling if you want to foil the Russian effort at least here on this sub. Then the focus stays on Ukraine, what the Russians have done, and our united effort of ALL of us to support Ukraine. My appeal to redditors is not don't discuss politics, just consider doing it in a different sub that is not used to help unite support for Ukraine.

Anyway probably not the answer you were looking for but that is probably why Putin is talking cancel culture. Generally speaking I don't expect redditors to like this post but thought I would make an effort to flesh out what info ops look like from countries like Russia. When you start looking for it you start to see if everywhere. It mixes in naturally with real internal political discussions so most have a hard time seeing it.

A Russian information operation is advancing the narrative that Russian forces are making significant progress in Bakhmut, likely to improve morale among Russian forces and possibly to improve the personal standing of Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces are largely responsible for the minimal gains in the area. Russian forces have made limited advances towards the Ukrainian strongpoint in Bakhmut but at a very slow speed and at great cost. Prigozhin acknowledged the slow pace of Wagner Group ground operations around Bakhmut on October 23 and stated that Wagner forces advance only 100-200m per day, which he absurdly claimed was a normal rate for modern advances.[1] Ukrainian forces recaptured a concrete factory on the eastern outskirts of Bakhmut around October 24.[2] Ukrainian military officials stated on October 16 that Russian forces had falsely claimed to have captured several towns near Bakhmut within the past several days, but Ukrainian forces held their lines against those Russian attacks.[3] Russian forces are likely falsifying claims of advances in the Bakhmut area to portray themselves as making gains in at least one sector amid continuing losses in northeast and southern Ukraine. Even the claimed rate of advance would be failure for a main effort in mechanized war--and the claims are, in fact, exaggerated.

He could have toppled the Zelenski government, and eaten up basically all of Ukraine facing very limited loses.  Putin's need to speed up the timeline for his own legacy meant he had to disregard the increased danger of such a large scale invasion though.

af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,yh40tr,iue8n65,"I think the reason for the invasion is more emotive than that. 

Putinites, like many ultra-nationalists, have a very intense (and skewed) relationship with the history of their nation. They view Russian history as a rise to greatness despite facing many disasters and invasions - and this rise starts with the medieval Kyivian Rus’. In short, Ukraine, and in particular Kyiv as the “mother of cities”, is absolutely central to their concept of Russia as a nation; they view it as literally the birthplace of their culture. 

Note that this historical vision doesn’t include Ukrainians as individuals or a people with their own history and language  - Russians view them as, basically, backwards and bumpkinish Russians, who ought rightly to be part of the Russian nation. 

Putinite Russians view Russian “greatness” through the lens of a unique Russian culture, and view it in opposition to that of Europe - which is seen as both very seductive and horribly decadent. 

Thus, when Ukrainians decided through the whole Euromaidan affair to turn their back on Russia and embrace Europe, this was seen as a most despicable type of betrayal and loss - the very birthplace of Russian culture turning its back on that culture, “little Russians” deciding not to be “Russians” at all! 

To Putinites, this outcome was just the result of successful agitation and subversion, and not to be tolerated. Ukraine must be reunited with Russia, and its people must become “Russian” - by force if (as it seems) necessary. Any other result would absolutely reverse the course of Russian destiny. 

It is this that gives the invasion of Ukraine its emotive appeal to many Russians. This also explains the otherwise bizarre focus of so much of Russian propaganda on apparently irrelevant matters, such as homosexuality. To Putinites, these are not simply irrelevant distractions - to them, the whole war is “about” rescuing Russian culture from the encroachment of decadence as it is about anything, and to them, that is what tolerance of sexual orientation is - decadence. 

This is also why all talk of compromises and negotiations is all so much hit air. Putinite Russia can never negotiate (at least, not in good faith), because it is not “about” owning this or that square kilometres of Ukrainian territory. They need a complete victory, they need Ukraine to become “the Ukraine” again - not a nation, but a part of Russia.",False,1667151863.0,t3_yh40tr,t1_iudxclg,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

He came into the diplomatic corp in late 90s or early 2000s - and he clearly and personally described how over the last 20 years the following:

> it’s the job of the foreign ministry to understand international relations and give feedback to the government

...completely stopped happening - because anyone who tried to be honest internally in Russia had their careers ruined and had their bosses screaming at them about how they weren't bringing back the news that the highers ups wanted to hear.

This feeds into why Putin had the delusional idea that Ukranians would welcome them with open arms, and why they had no idea what so ever that the west would lock arms and back Ukraine so heavily.

The most interesting thing was that this now-middle-aged guy KNEW this was the exact opposite of what a diplomatic corp is supposed to be doing, in the reports they submit back to their own government.  Making stuff up and lying to your own leaders because that's what they want to hear ... doesn't serve your country or protect your country's position, and he knew it.

Ships used as fire ships were either warships whose munitions were fully spent in battle, surplus ones which were old and worn out, or inexpensive purpose-built vessels rigged to be set afire, steered toward targets, and abandoned quickly by the crew.

Setting aside the ""Putin's chef"" meme, Prigozhin is an outsider. No doubt he had (or created) connections, but on a certain level he gained wealth functioning as an independent entity. He made himself useful to Putin via Wagner and the Internet Research Agency. Pure speculation on my part, but Putin should have immediately integrated or co-opted both groups with the existing Russian military and propaganda structure. Prigozhin probably said something along the lines of ""How come they didn't do this before? They were incapable of creating this, so how could you expect them to run this?"" Whatever the case may be, Putin *allowed* both to function as quasi independent entities, and in the process enabled Prigozhin to ""one up"" the establishment. This may eventually become dangerous for Putin. The Internet Research Agency can manufacture all sorts of chaos inside Russia in order to keep Putin looking elsewhere for threats, and Wagner can possibly provide personal protection for Prigozhin - if he ever decides to make a move against Putin.

Kadyrov is a self interested opportunist. By aligning himself with Prigozhin, Kadyrov is giving a sheen of legitimacy to him as well.

I don't know how anyone could consider the current Ukraine war anything but an obvious imperialist invasion.  It's not even a 20th century conflict, it's basically a 19th century conflict with 21st (and 20th) century weapons.

The fact that a bit of money can prop up a fake ""leftist"" group or just corrupt a small one that's hard-up for cash and lost its way, and have them run the Kremlin line, doesn't change the overwhelming reality of it.  Look at how fake ""BLM"" groups were Kremlin financed and used to stir up agitation for Russian benefit (i.e., to push internal dissent), vs real BLM groups weren't, in the US; or how leave vs stay was manipulated by Russian money, ultimately tipping the balance and preventing backing out.

>It was only after Stalin died, and specifically in the 1960s, that the Soviet Union designed new war plans. These were decidedly offensive nature and envisioned a blitzkrieg-type assault that allowed the Warsaw Pact to conquer most of Western Europe in a matter of days. It amazingly sought to integrate the liberal use of nuclear weapons with the Warsaw Pact’s formidable conventional military might.

>Specifically, the Soviet war planners (rightly) anticipated that the United States and its allies would resort to the massive use of nuclear weapons early in the conflict. As a result, they hoped to preempt their use in order to protect Soviet and Warsaw Pact territory.


>Regardless, nuclear weapons were a central part of the Soviet Union’s strategy to conquer all of Western Europe. As War Is Boring has pointed out, on the Northern front alone, “Warsaw Pact plans called for 189 nuclear weapons: 177 missiles and 12 bombs ranging in yield from five kilotons—roughly a quarter the size of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima—to 500 kilotons.” Additional nuclear weapons would have been used in the Central and Southern fronts as well.

>The larger nuclear weapons would be used to destroy major cities in Western Europe, including Hamburg, Bonn, Munich and Hannover in West Germany; Rotterdam, Utrecht and Amsterdam in the Netherlands; and Antwerp and Brussels in Belgium.

>No fewer than two nuclear weapons would have been used to destroy Copenhagen, and five nuclear weapons in total would have been unleashed on Denmark as well. A number of Italian cities would be targeted as well.

>Even Austria, which was a neutral country in the Cold War, would not be spared from atomic destruction. Soviet war plans called for dropping two 500 kiloton nuclear weapons on Vienna.

There are videos of the first day of the invasion of Zelensky calling Macron, notifying him of the full scale war. At that point the Russians were coming for Kyiv. Everyone was likely expecting that Ukraine had little chance against the second most powerful army in the world.

However, the quick decapitation of Kyiv didn’t come. Ukrainian resistance proved fierce. In this new reality, allied countries started providing weapons and economic support, as well as sanctions towards Russia, resulting in a longterm attritional war, still favoring slow Russian advances.

The US delivered medium range precision artillery in Spring IIRC. From then on, there were daily reports of vital logistical, personnel, weaponry losses on the Russian side, culminating in dramatic successful counteroffensives in Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson, etc…

With this, and knowing all peace negotiations with Russia are in vain, the ambitions have shifted: a full liberation of Ukraine including Crimea.

I don’t believe Putin cares that much whether Ukraine exists or doesn’t, he cares to the extent that it is useful to Russia. Ukraine will always be of utmost importance to any Russian power center. But it makes up for a great story to sell.

Putin can’t cut his losses. He made a gamble and he failed, he knows that if he tomorrow decides to withdraw it would be the end of him and will go down in history as a shameful ruler. He will try to get away with as much as possible but at this point he has no choice but to keep fighting because Ukraine will not stop until it fully restores their borders so there is no out for him where he calls it a day and keeps some territories.

Our cities are not warships. Modern thermonuclear warheads are many times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the point the later would be considered low-yield today.

Not directly, but the destruction of cities and civil infrastructure is going to annihilate supply chains, which are delicate in even the best of times. Whoever survives the initial strikes is going to run out of food and water very quickly.

Western nuclear use is gated more enhancing the rebound effect(mach reflections etc) than really any other factor. There is also additional effects to any warhead over 100kt where increased carbonization actually limits the actual firestorm potential especially if you plan for overlapping detonations. 

While you are focusing entirely on macro effects the reality is most of those situations are short lived. You think because WW2 took more bombs it had any less effect compared to a single explosion? The reality is a nuclear detonation is considerably less destructive in the long term than conventional explosives. 

Most of those studies are using... well poor assumptions on observed nuclear detonations that just really really don't work that way anymore. The average nuclear warhead is closer to 100kt and does not behave the same way as observed detonations of the past that many of these papers are built off of.

All of the arguments presented are moot however because the point you and many others don't seem to get is I am not advocating for nuclear usage. I am pointing out that even in the event of usage the number of nuclear bombs(in megatons) that can go off in the most likely scenarios are far FAR fewer than people fear. The ""shield"" presented by the weapons within Russia are ***ineffective*** from a ***military*** point of view because the majority of them will be incapable of being used and the final effect of their attempted use will be counter to what the goals of the weapons is supposed to be.

It was a physical impossibility to engage mad from a handful of boomers like it is today. Things like cruise missile warhead and gravity bombs were required to engage in nuclear war back then.

The accuracy of nuclear arms was also considerably worse back then as well. As in 500+ meters of deviation at 5000km. Enough deviation for the warheads of the day to actually become ineffective against their intended targets. Secondary strikes were again required to effectively prosecute a war. 

Today I can launch a missile from Iceland to Johannesburg and hit a specific person standing in a city. I'm not going to go into super detail but we can hit a GLBM silo or truck in minutes accurately and faster than those system can deploy and fire mostly because our targets are still using extremely limited and frankly soviet era designs. The situation you envision isn't possible. If America launches first.. there will not be a capacity for Russia to counter launch MAD... hell this is true even if we execute a purely conventional attack. 

Point blank the only nuclear launch scenario that actually ""works"" at all is a coordinated Russian launch of all SLBM/GLBM missiles.. They don't have enough to hold back any and they don't have enough second strike capacity to be a significant threat. Why do you think America doesn't really feel threatened by Russian missiles? Russia has to be perfect.. we barely have to try. 

The biggest fear we have is that they are stupid enough to commit suicide by NATO. Just because the exchange would be heavily in our favor doesn't mean we want to watch a nuclear device detonate nor do we want to unleash the required response against Russian assets to prevent it from happening twice.

Russia was never worried about NATO and any expansion of NATO/RUS borders poses no risk to RUS. Because if NATO wanted to wage a ""conventional war"" with Russia, it would look a lot like the first Gulf War.   


And it doesn't matter if the frontline at the moment of invasion was 10 or 1000 kilometres, which is why I'm telling you that the Baltics are not a chokepoint. Unless you have not been paying any attention during the war in Ukraine, not only is NATO more than able to negate any Russian attempt at using chokepoints (and there are no \*natural\* chokepoints in the Baltics, I live here, I should know), Russians are so not worried about NATO that they have moved almost all of their actually battle capable forces from Baltic borders to Ukraine, and that's including forces bordering Finland aswell.   


As I said, you're looking at Google maps and you're seeing Lake Peipus, a bridge to the north and a few hundred kilometres of forrests and a few major roads to the south. You end up at Belarus and think it makes one side of a chokepoint, and it doesnt. It's an incredibly simplistic way of looking at maps and thinking of chokes.  


The war began as an attempt at conquest. There are various reasons why Russia chose to conquer Ukraine and NATO is not even on the bottom of the list. NATO is used as a scarecrow for the Russian people, as an explanation as to why Russia isnt winning (not as to why its \*not losing\*, but why its \*not winning\*). But security from NATO was never a reason for the war.   


I think you should also be reminded that East European countries flocked to NATO en masse and it was their choice and decision. Would Russia see it as provocation? Maybe. Did anyone seriously consider that to be a threat to Russia? Only when used in scaremongering propaganda. Because Russia sure did not see it as a threat.",False,1667159830.0,t3_yh40tr,t1_iue9c20,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Cool, we’re not talking about Western nuclear weapons.

>While you are focusing entirely on macro effects the reality is most of those situations are short lived. You think because WW2 took more bombs it had any less effect compared to a single explosion?

Does it strain you more to pay a thousand dollar bill every month or shell out a hundred thousand dollars all at once? Same basic principle here. The systems supporting our society can survive incremental damage that would wreck them if it were delivered all at once.

>The ""shield"" presented by the weapons within Russia are ineffective from a military point of view because the majority of them will be incapable of being used and the final effect of their attempted use will be counter to what the goals of the weapons is supposed to be. They have the wrong kind of missiles, the wrong kind of launchers, and the wrong kind of doctrine to utilize them as an effective defense.

Nuclear deterrence goes beyond “the military point of view”; strategic nuclear weapons are ultimately political tools for achieving political objectives. Namely, ensuring the survival of your nation by making invasion too costly for any foe to stomach.

Could the US “win” a nuclear war in the sense of surviving while Russia doesn’t? Perhaps. But the country would never fully recover.

The entire argument you are presenting exists only if you ignore the disparity in nuclear technology, accuracy, and total capacity. I wont even touch what you think about society because frankly no model ever made operates as you suggest except for the most basic university student editions. Frankly if steel production and alcohol production exist... society is effectively going to maintain high levels of QOL. To give you a point... consider that there is almost no crop yield difference between a GPS guided tractor and a manually driven tractor... and you can make a manually driven one without electronics.

There is no ""perhaps"" There is the technological reality that the American response to nuclear weapons use is going to automatically limit any nuclear exchange to a survivable event and likely limit it to very few actual detonations. This capacity is pretty much public knowledge. It isn't a magical thing its just basic math. Nuclear deterrence requires that a nuclear detonation either avenges the loss of your nation or prevents the loss of your nation. The ACTUAL reality is we have long gone past that point and we simply don't give a shit about anyone elses nuclear capacity except their capacity for terrorism. The only world wide capacity for MAD is at Americas discretion.

///edit Hey... just for effect.. You know if you block me I cant read your rambling reply that looks like it was conducted by brand new butterbar who ""has an idea""?

The argument against electronics.. Yeah no. Just no. Jesus people don't have a fucking clue if they think the loss of microchips is the end of civilization.. Good god three decades ago most things didn't need chips more advanced than a 555 timer. Do any of you study history?  
The argument for nuclear winter... again.. you assume way to much about how many detonations are possible in a realistic nuclear exchange.. or for that matter more than the wiki understanding of nuclear winter and its impacts on food production.  
Same with food production.. it's a tired bad stupid trope idiots who cant do math go to when they think people are going to continue to grow cash crops after a natural disaster. In other words absolutely having ZERO UNDERSTANDING of the subject matter. Not being able to get strawberries to Ontario from California DOES NOT EQUATE to a collapse of the food security of a nation!

And that’s one reason why your analysis is worthless. The West has no political interest in “taking out” Russia, especially not at the cost of tens of millions of their own citizens. Doesn’t matter if it would be militarily advantageous to do so; such a war doesn’t serve out political interests in the slightest.

>The entire argument you are presenting exists only if you ignore the disparity in nuclear technology, accuracy, and total capacity.

The disparities matter little in the hypothetical scenario we’re discussing: Russia launching an all-out first strike in response to a conventional invasion it cannot defeat.

>I wont even touch what you think about society because frankly no model ever made operates as you suggest except for the most basic university student editions. Frankly if steel production and alcohol production exist... society is effectively going to maintain high levels of QOL.

What a joke. The collapse of our food distribution networks alone would lead to a mass exodus of survivors from cities—even untouched ones—on a scale unparalleled since the Fall of Rome.

Then there’s the matter of electronics. Do you understand how much of the economy relies on them? One factory falling behind on production was enough to squeeze the entire global economy. Now imagine what happens when the ability to import or domestically manufacture those components ceases to exist.

Further, consider how much of the financial sector has been digitized. The destruction of major financial centers and even a partial collapse of the Internet would destroy immense wealth. You’re looking at an economic disaster dwarfing the Great Depression.

You want to talk crop yields? Forget about tractors. You’re not going to have the fertilizer and pesticides modern agriculture relies upon because manufacturing and distribution would be in shambles if not nonexistent.

That’s assuming fallout and nuclear winter have *no* impact on food production, which is unbelievably charitable.

Then you face the challenge of distributing whatever food you do grow via infrastructure and transportation systems which now lie in ruins.

Backsliding into a pre-industrial society is very much on the table, especially given how many people would have to return to subsistence farming just to stave off famine.
