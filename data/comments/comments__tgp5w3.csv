There is no connection in the city, no water, no gas, no ambulances. People with torn limbs bleed in their yards and no one can help them. These are peaceful people - our acquaintances and relatives. The dead are simply being covered by soil where they lay. 

  
Yes, we collected snow, warmed it on a campfire, and cooked macaroni. My family was in the bomb shelter of High School No 2. Three days ago a shell flew there and shattered some of the windows. A woman was wounded in her hip.

His courage and eloquence in the face of unceasing Russian atrocities continues to inspire me:

""Perpetration induced traumatic stress, known as PITS, is a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. Its symptoms are caused by being an active participant in causing trauma.

Sufferers of PITS may be found in many roles such as soldiers or executioners, where they are expected to cause trauma including death.

But diplomats - especially here in the United Nations, especially here in the Security Council. Compared to the more well-known and understood PTSD there appears to be greater severity and different symptom patterns for those affected by PITS.

The case of the military aggression of Russia against Ukraine and the mass atrocities perpetrated by the Russian army - ordered by Putin and defended by the Russian diplomats - will be examined by scholars and scientists, including in the areas of sociology, history, philosophy, psychiatry and theology

Today, however, I would like to quote from ""Into the abyss"", a documentary about executioners of the death penalty. One guard began crying and shaking uncontrollably when, I quote, the eyes of all the inmates he had executed began flashing before him, end of quote.

Ambassador, do the eyes of Ukrainian children, women and elderly killed by the Russians flash before you?

> This afternoon the Russian media outlet “Pravda” falsely reported that three members of the Tennessee National Guard, which it labeled as “mercenaries” were killed while fighting in Ukraine.
> 
> The reporting by “Pravda” is patently false.
> 
> “The three soldiers identified in the article are either current or former members of the Tennessee National Guard,” according to the Office of the Tennessee Adjutant General. “They are accounted for, safe and not, as the article headline erroneously states, US mercenaries killed in Donetsk People’s Republic.”
> 
> It is believed that the individuals were targeted by Russian media due to articles that appeared on the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service related to a 2018 deployment as part of the Multinational Training Group-Ukraine which included members of the Tennessee National Guard’s 278th Armored Cavalry Regiment.
> 
> During the 2018 mission, more than 200 soldiers assisted the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the continued development of the Yavoriv Combat Training Center. This effort included the development of cadre, ranges and training areas; equipment and instrumentation requirements, and a realistic operational training environment.
> 
> All members of the Tennessee National Guard returned safely to their home state in 2019 after a successful mission.

These targets are said to include facilities of the Federal Network Agency, which deals with new developments in telecommunications, the energy industry and electricity and gas, among other things, on behalf of the Federal Ministry of Economics, according to FOCUS, citing security circles in Berlin.

> The secret investigation at the Office for the Protection of the Constitution was triggered by the arrest of a Russian sabotage unit caught two weeks ago in Ukraine. In the luggage of the men were found notes and coordinates that led to German territory. One piece of paper noted the small community of Markersdorf in the district of Görlitz, where there is a site of the Bonn-based Federal Network Agency.

**EDIT: OFCOM OFFICIAL MESSAGE:** 

> Ofcom has today revoked RT's licence to broadcast in the UK, with immediate effect.
> 
> We have done so on the basis that we do not consider RT’s licensee, ANO TV Novosti, fit and proper to hold a UK broadcast licence.
> 
> Today’s decision comes amid 29 ongoing investigations by Ofcom into the due impartiality of RT’s news and current affairs coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We consider the volume and potentially serious nature of the issues raised within such a short period to be of great concern – especially given RT’s compliance history, which has seen the channel fined £200,000 for previous due impartiality breaches.
> 
> In this context, we launched a separate investigation to determine whether ANO TV Novosti is fit and proper to retain its licence to broadcast.
> 
> This investigation has taken account of a number of factors, including RT’s relationship with the Russian Federation. It has recognised that RT is funded by the Russian state, which has recently invaded a neighbouring sovereign country. We also note new laws in Russia which effectively criminalise any independent journalism that departs from the Russian state’s own news narrative, in particular in relation to the invasion of Ukraine. We consider that given these constraints it appears impossible for RT to comply with the due impartiality rules of our Broadcasting Code in the circumstances.
> 
> We recognise that RT is currently off air in the UK, as a result of sanctions imposed by the EU since the invasion of Ukraine commenced. We take seriously the importance, in our democratic society, of a broadcaster’s right to freedom of expression and the audience’s right to receive information and ideas without undue interference. We also take seriously the importance of maintaining audiences’ trust and public confidence in the UK’s broadcasting regulatory regime.
> 
> Taking all of this into account, as well as our immediate and repeated compliance concerns, we have concluded that we cannot be satisfied that RT can be a responsible broadcaster in the current circumstances. Ofcom is therefore revoking RT’s licence to broadcast with immediate effect.

> Sam Sachdeva
> 
> The Government has imposed a first set of sanctions against those connected to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – but a prominent oligarch in the New Zealand spotlight remains off the list.
> 
> Regulations which came into force overnight have now taken aim at Russian leader Vladimir Putin and 12 other members of his Security Council, including foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, former president Dmitry Medvedev and army general Sergei Shoigu.
> 
> In addition, 19 organisations have been targeted, including the Cossack National Guard, state-backed Russian bank PSB and semiconductor manufacturer JSC Integral.
> 
> Any ships or aircraft owned by, or connected to, those on the sanctions list are now prohibited from entering New Zealand territory, while New Zealanders cannot deal with any assets inside or outside the country tied to those on the list.
> 
> Separately, the list of those banned from entering New Zealand has been increased significantly and now includes members of Russia’s State Duma (lower house) who voted in favour of recognising the independence of Ukraine territories Donetsk and Luhansk in February.

[International Medical Corps](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/ukraine/) provides medical assistance in the region. They have very low fundraising overhead (1% of income), with 89% of donations going to medical aid and 10% to administration. 

[Voices of Children](https://voices.org.ua/en/who-we-are/), a Ukrainian organization that helps children cope with the horrors of war, PTSD, readjusting to school, and getting back to being kids. They have also been doing a lot of grassroots impromptu work during the war, such as helping set up shelters. Our hope is that this war will be over soon, and they can begin the work of healing these kids' hearts.

1)  The United States has a policy of defending Taiwan in the case of a military attack, as long as it Taiwan doesn't declare formal independence.  Its called the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), its literal US law.  We know it, Taiwan knows it, and China knows it.  China probably even secretly likes it, cause it lets them rail against the US and not disrupt things in reality.

2)  Taiwan is very capable of defending itself.  Because of the TRA (above), we sell them VERY advanced weaponry.  Like, literally frigates, helicopters, patriots, artillery, late generation f-16s.  You think Ukraine can resist Russia?  Taiwan would absolutely fuck up any Chinese attempt to invade, certainly long for the 7th fleet to relieve the island.  

3)  China has no strategic incentive to invade.  Because of the TRA diplomacy, there is an understanding that technically there is one China and Taiwan is a self governing state.  On the outside, this seems like a farce and bullshit, but its enough face saving for the CCP to accept.  Sure sabers are rattled for domestic politics, but it really isnt gonna be a buildup like Russia, at least for now.  And if there is, the US will absolutely respond forcefully.  That is why you hear the US make a pro Taiwan statement every now and then, but there is not and will not be in the future a formal Taiwanese embassy in DC.

4)  China depends on the world's trade for legitimacy in providing GDP growth.  The agreement the CCP has with its citizens is basically ""we will make you richer, just stay away from politics"".  Russia style sanctions would result in such a disruption to business, that very agreement and maybe the CCP would be over.

5)  Taiwan makes a lot of things for China and it also invests a lot of money in the mainland.  The capital flight in the case of invasion would make Russia's crash look like daycare pickup.",False,1647577261.0,t3_tgp5w3,t3_tgp5w3,,0,88,0,88,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

👉🆕 Aftermath of attack on Konotop shows destroyed Russian vehicles. This is the same town where Russian soldiers earlier this month walked in with armed hand grenades in hand, demanding residents surrender. The town remains in Ukrainian hands

👉🆕 Kramatorsk, a city in Donetsk Oblast with 150k residents, has seen missile attacks again today, with one reportedly striking the city's centre hitting residential buildings. Initial casualties reported as two killed and six wounded. Russian claims earlier today that they had hit the Ukrainian Security Service SBU's headquarters in Kramatorsk have been found untrue

👉🆕 Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov has reiterated the Russian threat that any foreign military shipments to Ukraine are legitimate targets, this after reports that Ukraine may get new air defence systems supplied

For those who don't understand what's going on in Moscow right now at the Luzhniki Stadium.

In several earlier posts I wrote about what many here have been worried about for a long, long time: the president has not come out to the people for a very, very long time (several years in fact), he does not even allow his closest ministers near him, all the time engaged in some kind of satanism (actually bloody shamanism with Defense Minister Shoigu and occultism with the head of their ""criminal community"" (Bank Russia - the bank where no ordinary Russians have ever held their money or had cards) Yury Kovalchuk.) 

Methodology: overriding an old problem with a new problem is a favorite practice of our tsars since ~1650. 

Now when there has been a war going on for three weeks that can't be called a war, no one understands where the president is, there is some fucked up shit going on at the front with kids born in 2003 and Chechens, and every third Russian has relatives (distant or close) in Ukraine morale is very low and anxiety is insanely high.

In such cases, the Russian tsars act like this: let's have some sort of ostentatious holiday? Let's have an extra state holiday, fireworks, hand out little flags, and unleash some corrupt artists to sing hits from sixty years ago?

As you can imagine there aren't really that many people who really want to participate in this celebration of idiocracy (especially since it's a WORKING DAY).

In such cases (to create a mass crowd) they send out demands to government agencies (and there are a lot of them here): not just the government, but schools, universities, hospitals, state factories and plants, railroads, subways, etc.

The order is as follows: the enterprise is obliged to send a certain number of workers to celebrate the idiocracy. If there are not enough people, the company will be punished and people will be fined or fired for resisting. Schoolchildren and students are taken away from classes, mostly by force, under threat of expulsion/unsatisfactory grades for the year.

> The Soviet Union came apart because it overstretched itself and ran out of money and ideas. Local elites saw no benefit in remaining part of a bankrupt country. It fragmented along the administrative borders of the 15 republics that made up the giant country.

> Yet there was no reason why the process had to stop there. Indeed, many of Russia’s regions—including Siberia, Ural, Karelia and Tatarstan—declared their “sovereignty” at the time. To prevent further disintegration Russia’s then president, Boris Yeltsin, came up with the idea of a federation, promising each region as much “sovereignty as it could swallow”. Yeltsin made this promise in Kazan, the ancient capital of Tatarstan, which acquired many attributes of a separate state: a president, a constitution, a flag and, most important, its own budget. In exchange, Tatarstan promised to stay part of Russia.

> Putin is keeping Russia together through force and payoffs to regions and regional leaders. Putin will turn 63 this year (born Oct 1952). An average life expectancy for a wealthy Russian man who takes care of his health would be about 75-80 years. So a post Putin situation would likely become a reality by 2027-2032 based on his death from aging or earlier if he lost power for other reasons.

> There was a vote in March, 1992 by Tartarstan on sovereignty

> A majority of Tatarstan’s citizens then voted for state sovereignty in the referendum.

> If Mr Putin goes and the money runs out, Chechnya could be the first to break off.

> Tatarstan, home to 2m Muslim ethnic Tatars and 1.5m ethnic Russians, could declare itself the separate khanate it was in the 15th century. It has a strong identity, a diverse economy, which includes its own oil firm, and a well-educated ruling class. It would form a special relationship with Crimea, which Crimean Tartars (at last able to claim their historic land) would declare an independent state.

> The Ural region could form a republic—as it tried to do in 1993—around Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, or else it could form a union with Siberia.

> Siberia itself could revive its own identity, from a base in the cities of Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, and lay claim to its oil-and-gas riches, which it would sell to China. Unlike Russia, China might not have much interest in territorial expansion into the sparsely populated Far East and Siberia, but it could (and already does) colonise these regions economically. Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, two of the largest cities in the Far East, are more economically integrated with China and South Korea than they are with the European part of Russia.",1647571317.0,1647571105.0,t3_tgp5w3,t3_tgp5w3,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

So Russia sees Taiwan as part of China.  I’m not really buying that China is completely opposed to the invasion of Ukraine.  I was wondering what Russia’s position is regarding Taiwan.  It’s clear that Russia is in a massive co-dependent relationship (edit: with China) going forward.  

No warm fuzzies over this relationship.

> Unlike a traditional missile, fired at a target visible at launch, the Switchblade cruises over the battlefield for up to 15 minutes, sending back video for the operator to detect, locate and identify targets up to six miles away. Once confirmed, the operator locks on and Switchblade dives in to destroy the target with a small but powerful fragmentation charge that can take out a group or roomful of individuals or a pickup truck. It can circle around defenses or can dive vertically to defeat targets in trenches or foxholes, making most forms of cover useless.
> 
> While it only flies at about 65 mph and is driven by an electric propeller, the makers still refer to Switchblade as a missile — in a sense it could be viewed as a miniature cruise missile. And it should be emphasized that it is tiny: The whole system in its launch tube weighs less than six pounds.

""It is the policy of the United States–to maintain the **CAPACITY** of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan.

Let's go see what other official documents say about Taiwan.

""the United States recognized the Government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.""

> 
> Almost three-quarters of the Russian population support the war with Ukraine, experiencing such positive emotions as pride, joy, respect, trust and hope. This is evidenced by the data of two polls conducted by a group of independent Russian sociologists with an interval of one and a half weeks from the end of February to mid-March. The results were received by the editors of Radio Liberty.
> 
> When asked how they are affected by the actions of the Russian President, a third of respondents said they strongly believe that Putin is working in their interests, and another 26 percent say that he is working in their interests to some extent. In general, most Russians believe that it would be better if Putin remained president for as long as possible. This opinion is most common among the television audience. Russians who rely on personal connections and digital platforms perceive the president differently, according to a study by independent Russian sociologists.

> Despite the misleading claims about Syrian recruitment, many Syrians do indeed stand willing to fight in Ukraine. Syrian media portrays Russia as handily defeating Ukrainian forces. Many potential “volunteers” thus see these contracts as a viable and much-needed source of income at a time when the only jobs within Syria are in the army or militias — and even those do not pay a living wage. Moreover, there is also a strong sense of loyalty to Russia among select units, pushing their leadership and rank and file to want to deploy. This phenomenon is prominent among a few north Hama NDF units — such as the aforementioned Souran NDF — but most particularly within the Christian NDF units from Mahradah and Suqaylabiyah.
> 
> Syrians are increasingly angry over Russia’s inaction against Israeli airstrikes and perceived unwillingness to fully conquer the opposition-held Idlib territory. As one NDF officer described the changing situation, “People are starting to realize bit by bit that Syria and Russia are not one and that Russia just follows Russian interests.” Underscoring this are recent statements from the infamous Aleppo MP Fares Shehabi, a powerful businessman once very supportive of Russia, who tweeted on March 11, “This is not our war and no Syrian should fight in it. … Russia is our ally but she is not in danger and the battleground is not on Russian soil..! The Syrian army is a professional & constitutional army and is not a mercenary army for hire like Syrian oppositions gangs are. Russia knows that.”
> 
> A potential Syrian deployment to Ukraine does appear more likely now than it did two weeks ago. But it is important to be wary of the deluge of Syrian opposition — and now Ukrainian — rumors surrounding the topic. If Syrians are sent it will be a relatively small number of individuals, not entire military units; they will have little to no impact on the battlefield and they will have been lured to their death by lies and the mirage of financial stability. Analysis of this subject would be better focused on its potential impact within Syria. The more fighters from its core proxies that Russia sends, the more it risks weakening its own position within Syria. Meanwhile, the prospect of the war criminal Mohammed Jaber and the former Desert Hawks returning to prominence within Syrian military and political circles is an interesting one, with unclear effects on the local dynamics of the core Alawite communities on Syria’s coast.

I don't know why people keep repeating this without context. 

From the CIA factbook: 

>information varies; approximately 850,000 total active duty troops   
(300,000 Ground Troops; 40,000 Airborne Troops; 150,000 Navy; 160,000   
Aerospace Forces; 70,000 Strategic Rocket Forces; approximately 20,000   
special operations forces; approximately 100,000 other uniformed   
personnel (command and control, cyber, support, logistics, security,   
etc.); estimated 200-250,000 Federal National Guard Troops (2021)

Just because you have 900k on your payroll does not mean you have 900k bodies to throw into a war. 

they have 300,000 ground soldiers, 40,000 paratroopers, 70,000 artillery, 20,000 special ops.

That's 430k effective soldiers worldwide. 150k in navy are not marching in on the ground or in tanks to attack Ukraine so they're out, 100k logistical staff are also not there, so that's out too, the 160k aerospace forces is pilots + the support stuff for pilots, so they're basically out as the pilots are going to be such a small amount of that.

Russia is calling in every chip they have worldwide because they have no more spare combat effective ground troops in this invasion now. They're activating reserves and bribing mercenaries in because \_all their ground troops are spent\_.

When you put 350k casualties per year against their \_total effective world wide presence\_, they'll deplete every soldier that have globally in that time, and there is no way they pulled every single grunt, artillery specialist and paratrooper from global deployments in Syria, Moldova, Georgia, etc yet, which means the army on the ground is a lot smaller.

1. US and India being Bros is a very recent phenomenon. For a long time through our history Russia has supported India while US was a strong ally of Pakistan e.g. on Kashmir (India's most thorny geo-political issue), US always sided with Pakistan while Russia always backed us. We have been threatened, bullied and sanctioned by the US and every single time, Russia backed us and helped us.

2. Because of this we also have a lot of practical dependence on Russia - a lot of our military equipment is Russian and depends on continued inflow of Russian Spare parts and supplies - so pissing off Russia totally isn't really an option for us. Remember while we were buying Russian equipment, US was selling planes etc. to Pakistan

3. Hence, while many of us would agree that Russia attacking Ukraine is unfair and wrong we also feel like it's not our fight and it would be both impractical for us as a country to take sides on this. India isn't really siding with Russia, it's just trying to stay out of taking sides on the whole thing.

Geo-politics is often not about right or wrong. It's about the practical constraints we have as a country and doing what we need to so that we don't get screwed on our military equipment, on Kashmir or on other things which are important to us.

The US is no different - for all the talk of democracy and freedom, the US supported and continues to support many dictactorships and totalitarian regimes because it made strategic sense, and that's ok. We all gotta do what works for us.",1647580652.0,1647580466.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i146dzz,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

First, that it will become North Korea, economically speaking, all at once. They are projected to lose, even with optimistic anti-Putin projections, a whopping 8% of their GDP this year (7% more realistic). That's not great, but is a long, long way from North Korea territory. They still have oil and gas money coming in and can sell to China and India, even if at a discount, to keep foreign currency up. The ruble has rebounded somewhat, and is almost back to 0.01 from its 0.007 low when sanctions hit. They are not dependent on outsiders for natural resources the same way that the USA or Europe are, and have plenty of people who will sell them what they do need, even if at a mark up. Life is going to get shittier in Russia, unemployment will spike, wages will drop, and people will be miserable - but police and propagandists will be paid and party faithful will be paid off on time and in full. The regime will survive.

Second, and on that point, don't underestimate how much people are willing to put up with - especially if a decline can be spaced out over a year or two - and how easily propaganda can make people comfortable with cognitive dissonance or bats*** insanity.

In America and Canada, people have the benefits of free press and lots of good reporting. Still, vast numbers of people have easily persuaded of the most insane nonsense - a pattern that's been going on for *generations.* Now imagine a world where literally the only legal news source was Fox, and contradicting Tucker Carlson attracted a prison sentence of up to 15 years. That's Russia right now.

How many people in those circumstances will be able to understand enough of what's going on to meaningfully respond, even if they wanted to? 

Most likely scenario is that Putin is going to be sitting on this throne for another decade, at least, as he drifts further and further into Mugabe levels of senile insanity, and Russia's brief lived attempt at democracy will finally die the coward's death it probably deserves, as the culture as a whole decides its better to live on their knees.",False,1647616986.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i15r2a7,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

They'll endure the pain if they believe it'll achieve their goals after the dust settles. Xi wants to see this within his lifetime, even if he's no longer in power when it comes to fruition.

He may just play his hand before he's ready and it'll backfire. Or..... The west is in for in some ugly decades ahead; the whole world is.

NATO couldn't risk being seen as making a guarantee that we wouldn't back, so we felt that it was necessary to communicate really on that we weren't going to send soldiers there.

At that point, Putin now has a choice: is it worth a bunch of sanctions and finger wagging to have a chance at, in his mind, breaking up Western hegemony? And for him, clear answer is yes. Low risk relative to reward.

No one's worried about Russia immediately triggering nukes.

It was adopted 3 November 1950, after fourteen days of Assembly discussions, by a vote of 52 to 5, with 2 abstentions.
 
**[United Nations Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Command)** 
 
 >United Nations Command (UNC or UN Command) is the multinational military force established to support the Republic of Korea (South Korea) during and after the Korean War. It was the first international unified command in history, and the first attempt at collective security pursuant to the Charter of the United Nations. The UNC was established on 7 July 1950 following the UN Security Council's recognition of North Korean aggression against South Korea.

[More than two dozen Senate Republicans demand Biden do more for Ukraine after voting against $13.6 billion for Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/17/republicans-ukraine-aid-vote/)

>“President Biden needs to make a decision TODAY: either give Ukraine access to the planes and antiaircraft defense systems it needs to defend itself, or enforce a no-fly zone to close Ukrainian skies to Russian attacks,” Scott said in a statement. “If President Biden does not do this NOW, President Biden will show himself to be absolutely heartless and ignorant of the deaths of innocent Ukrainian children and families.”

>Last week, Scott was one of 31 Republicans to vote against a sweeping, $1.5 trillion spending bill to fund government agencies and departments through the remainder of the fiscal year and that would also include $13.6 billion in assistance for Ukraine. Biden signed the bill into law Tuesday, casting the aid as the United States “moving urgently to further augment the support to the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country.”

To add additional context for people not familiar with the disfunction of the US government, democrats tied Ukraine aid to a bill that pays money that the government already owes.

Republicans are big mad about this because ever since Obama became president they've been taking what used to be a routine bipartisan bill hostage, threatening the country with a government shutdown and potential default if they don't get their way. Using this strategy they've already cost the US trillions of dollars and a credit downgrade, in return they've gotten jack shit but they seem determined to try again and again (as long as a democrat holds the presidency).",False,1647581656.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i149dvi,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Did I think it would be with so little ground gained? No.

But I thought there would be a stalemate around Kyiv, maybe Dnieper River.

The thing is that the expert field is littered with analysts who don't challenge their own assumptions with any vigour.

Too much 'common knowledge' was about how strong Russia is militarily, without looking at logistics and economics. I don't think anyone expect this level of idiocy, but many predicted resistance.

I had the fortune to meet and be friends with a few Ukrainians over the years and every single one was a passionate individual with a strong sense of identity. My experience with them meant in my mind; Ukraine would resist and very strongly.

All they needed was equipment and support.

When the geopolitical narrative around the week leading up to the invasion was cohesive and loud in allied media, the response would be likewise.

The final element was training and experience; the west had been providing training for some time since 2014, and experience had been provided from the seperatist wars. Combine the two and it's a potent mix as allied tactics adapt to circumstance and there was a lot of circumstances to refine the training.

If you couple these things, any analyst with a military background and a brain can see how this is going to go down, at least in a reasonable context - chaos, no quick win for Russia.

We've just had a steady diet of 'Russia military strong' for such a long time that 'common knowledge' becomes a default mindset.

TLDR; anyone with any holistic knowledge knew this would not be quick, seeing the current Russian situation, Ukraine has a chance to legitimately win this and that chance keeps growing under current conditions.

* Lucasfilm used deep-fake techniques to create young Luke-skywalker in a recent episode of Boba Fett. They had the benefits of being able to cast an actor with a very similar head and body shape as young mark Hamill, they were able to direct his performance so that mannerisms and expressions would be similar to a young Mark Hamill, complete control over lighting and production circumstances, being able to avoid angles that would cause the deep-fake software from glitching out, and MONTHS of post-production time to tweak everything.
* Using this technology, they were able to create about a minute's worth of ***nearly*** perfect visuals of young Mark Hamil. It's important to note that all of this does NOTHING to the voice. To get the voice right, you either need to have actual Mark Hamill do the voice-over perfectly in sync with the actor's performance, or do a completely separate audio-deep-fake overpass on the actors readings. This technology is actually not nearly as good as the visual deep-fake and requires even more tweaking to conceal to ""computerness"" of it. And even with the months of work, a lot of viewers thought the lines came out sounding kind of weird and robotic.
* So given all of this, to allege that Russia deep-faked this, you are alleging that Russia, which has been incompetent so far in this war with fakery, suddenly busts out a perfect deep-fake technology that works for shots that go on for minutes at a time, perfect audio-deep-fake-tech, with totally uncontrolled angles and the insane visual noise in the background (thousands of people and faces waving flags) that is the exact type of thing that would confuse the fuck out of software.

Omg the race thing is not only a complete non sequitur but *so reaching* on this one. You're aware that race baiting is a Kremlin talking point, right? Sorry but idk how to get through to you if you can't understand why this war is different to a long list of civil wars. My reasons for concern include the constant one sided nuke threats, the obvious fact since day 1 that this is an expansionist enterprise and if Putin wins he won't stop, the exchanging of escalatory threats, how one mis-step at this point may start WWIII, and then after that, things like personally knowing Ukranians, the humanitarian issues and it being very fucking close to where I live.

FYI, I'd feel the same way if China invaded Taiwan, for many of the same reasons- challenging the world order, daring NATO intervention, the economic consequences, plus the humanitarian issues, so your incredibly narrow line of reasoning falls straight down anyway.

Article 5 only gets invoked when a NAYO member territory is attacked. See 9/11.

>Basically, because NATO is a defensive pact, if a member intervenes without being attacked first themselves, they are effectively surrendering their NATO defense (I think, I'm no expert.)

NATO is much more than a defensive pact. NATO has been involved in non-defensive operations. NATO was very active during the Cold War during the Containment policies of the US. After the fall of the USSR they're role pivoted in the 90s to include military support of non-NATO members. See Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya, and Iraq as examples. They've also assisted in Pakistan.

>Technically there is nothing legally stopping a country from intervening though, I believe.

Once we start talking about countries there is no oversight. The International Court of Justice isn't recognized by a number of countries and the UN, outside of the UNSC, has no way to enforce ICJ rulings which are usually just civil in nature. 

The enforcement is supposed to be by the UNSC which was designed to the the police force of the UN, see FDR's Four Policemen for more. Russia is a part of the UNSC. So the question becomes who watches the UNSC? No one. That's the answer and that was by design.

The ICC was created via the Rome Statute. However, not everyone signed that treaty. The US for example doesn't recognize it. A number of countries do not recognize it and there isn't a real way to enforce rulings.

So to answer your question, nothing legally is stopping any country from doing anything. Every system at that level operates on ""good faith"".",1647573157.0,1647572760.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i13tt3i,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

It was part of a series of protests and political events that had begun in 2002 and continued as the invasion, war, and occupation took place. The day was described by social movement researchers as ""the largest protest event in human history"".

Disclaimer: I don't think we *should* look at it from a purely military standpoint, but I do so to address the proposition that he's fine with EU status and not NATO status.

If the Kremlin sees NATO not as a defensive alliance but as an offensive one, then their goal is to separate potential invasion points with buffer zones. Current NATO states that border Russia are in mountainous, chokepointed regions (e.g., Latvia). In comparison, Belarus and Ukraine are part of the North European Plain, a large flat basin region that flows out from Germany and across Russia with no good defensive geography until you reach the Urals. It is expansive and difficult to defend in open field warfare, unless you're relying on weather patterns to save you and turn the plainsland into winter tundra or spring thaw mudpits. The best staging grounds possible for a NATO invasion force would therefore be in Belarus and/or Ukraine. By incapacitating them as puppet states, Russia is able to use them as a literal geographical shield from ground invasion, stage soldiers at the neck of the plain where there are fewer enemy staging grounds, and apply scorched earth warfare to the regions if they are attacked. It gives Moscow hundreds of miles of additional room to maneuver. So if you're paranoid Kremlin agents operating on the premise that NATO is actively hostile to Russia *and* aware that Russian ground forces are weaker than saber-rattling tactics would indicate, it would be a primary goal to secure those regions and close down avenues of attack.

In comparison, the same puppet states joining the EU means you are siphoning off EU trade wealth into Russia proper while also negating any threat of a direct NATO assault through those lands, as NATO states in the EU won't invade non-NATO states in the EU just for the purpose of attacking Russia.

It's paranoid Soviet-era bullshit that anyone would even *want* to invade Russia. But these guys have shown themselves to be paranoid relics of the Soviet era, so if you operate from their perspective it's not difficult to see why Ukrainian NATO membership is a greater threat in their head to the sovereignty of Russia than is EU membership. The former means a permanent hostile military presence along hundreds of miles of poorly secured flatland borders with hundreds of miles of indefensible rural terrain with an underfunded conscript army and an anemic air force to ""protect"" you. The latter means you keep your geographical buffer and, potentially, also get more money/indirect trade access if you can depose the leadership and lock in Kremlin sympathizers.",False,1647615070.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i1561tu,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The ""One-China policy"" is the position held by the People's Republic of China (PRC), shared by the same claim pertaining to the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC), that there is only one sovereign state under the name China and Taiwan is a part of China, as opposed to the idea that there are two separate sovereign states, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC).
 
**One-China policy** 
 
 [United States policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-China_policy#United_States_policy) 
 
 >The United States' One-China policy was first stated in the Shanghai Communiqué of 1972: ""the United States acknowledges that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States does not challenge that position"". The United States has not expressed an explicitly immutable statement regarding whether it believes Taiwan is independent or not. Instead, Washington simply states that they understand the PRC's claims on Taiwan as its own.

That's wrong, and it has to be corrected.  The only way to break a country away from that much mass hysteria historically is to take out as many of its' soldiers during a war as possible.

They did it b/c we wound up having to kill off a huge percentage of their fighting age males, and burned their cities to the ground.

There's basically no reason for NATO to begin slaughtering Russians (/ whoever) in a conventional (non-nuclear, non-asymmetric) war.

Like, in the Gulf War, 80K Iraqi military were captured. 20-50K killed. Tragically, 3,664 Iraqi civilians killed.

Because NATO is really, really good at destroying military targets, we are capable of those sorts of ratios. Up to 4 captured soldiers for every 1 killed, 5 military deaths for every 1 civilian death.

Obviously, in a world war, an absolutely horrific number of people would die, so let us all endeavor that WW3 never come to pass. But a conventional war wouldn't need to involve any ""slaughter"" of Russians.

We'd just use precision munitions to blow up every enemy military asset.

The high civilian death tolls of recent US wars come from the asymmetric phase when the enemy runs out of military assets and we start blowing up pick-up-trucks and funerals.

The high civilian death tolls in Ukraine come from Russia's genocidal military doctrine, which, in a conventional war against NATO, would be easily foiled.",False,1647606984.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i155194,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

This may well be a genuine video, but it could also be genuine video taken out of context, or from a different time. Maybe it's a major advance, maybe it's part of a back and forth. Nevermind the fact that Russia was supposed to take over most major cities in a few days, and the largest cities within two weeks. Putin's rage, his sacking of military and intelligence officers, his increasingly vitriolic speeches, the loss of so much equipment and so many troops (even by conservative estimates), these all show that this clearly hasn't gone according to plan. The fact that the relatively minor entrance (if true) to a non-major city is being used to suggest that they are ""winning"", shows how low the bar has fallen. 

You may not consider yourself a conspiracy theorist, but you are actively choosing to believe the news and info coming straight from the leader that ordered the invasion. From media that can face up to 15 years in prison for ""spreading falsehoods"". From a country where the last major media outlet to question the government shut down due to that law. Where every media outlet now echoes the same information. 

I'm always perplexed that conspiracy theorists have an infinite amount of skepticism toward ""mainstream media"", which they define as any source they don't agree, but apply no skepticism at all to their media sources who were literally formed to support a partisan caus. They trust their uncle on Facebook, a youtube video, a viral Instagram post, a website saying that there's a global cabal of pedophiles underneath a pizza shop... but god forbit they believe anything from an established, award-winning paper who covers events without commentary, has strict ethical guidelines, has investigated and broken scandals on both sides of an issue, etc. etc. 

I personally hate the Wall Street Journal. Their views don't align with mine. But their reporting, as opposed to editorials, is well-known to be quality. If the U.S. invaded Canada, the Wall Street journal would NEVER report that Canada had started it, even though they have some bias toward US. That's one good sign you can look for. Are political opponents still reading it for the news? Journalists as a whole are actually very principled and take their training seriously . 

There are many other ways to vet a source. They are well-covered in most science and social science classes. I'd recommemnd looking into these . 

in fairness, many on the other side of you in this sub also spread information with no verification. Even though I really want them to be true, I don't believe anything until I have verification from a legitimate source. I mean, Jesus Christ dude it's not that fucking hard.

There is the obvious threat that those nukes may fall in the wrong hands should any of those political systems topple over.  


But much more dangerous is that most of these countries also don't have enough nukes to make MAD a viable strategy.

 >In psychology, the dark triad comprises the personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. They are called dark because of their malevolent qualities. Research on the dark triad is used in applied psychology, especially within the fields of law enforcement, clinical psychology, and business management. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress, and create severe problems for organizations, especially if they are in leadership positions.

As far as I could determine, it was not Ukrainians, but the people on the Polish side. In fact, everyone who was interviewed talked about how kind and friendly and inclusive the Ukrainians had been to them.  
To put the best benefit of the doubt on things, my speculation is that in the sudden tsunami of people pouring into Poland, that there was not enough time to sufficiently vet all the intake personnel to be sure they were a good fit for the job.

There were also a couple of news stories that made a point of showing how nice the Hungarians were to people of all ethnicities.

Some people in the US were very upset that the story was reported at all, and even more upset that it was discussed. You can draw your own conclusions, but again, to try to put it in the best possible light, there are many white folks in the US who are just not used to seeing atrocities committed against other white folks, to the point that it is emotionally disorienting for them, and they probably say things that they would not usually say out loud in public.

Germany with ww2 era tanks and a 90% horseback supplied army that had to supply 3 million men got to Moscow in under 6 months from the middle of Poland.   


If the US wanted to invade Russia with speed being its focus regardless of losses then it would probably get through the buffer zones and Russia within 3 months, not even that long to be honest if they didn't care about losses.   


Most likely the US would spend months bombing Russia out and then slowly advance into Russia like they did Iraq. Destroy the airforce/air defence systems, bomb strategic resources and then roll over an army that cant match you in anyway.   


No army can beat an opposing one that has air supremacy and that focuses on close air support the way the US does. Its slow its methodical but it gets the job done and few casualties result from it.

 >The Nero Decree (German: Nerobefehl) was issued by Adolf Hitler on March 19, 1945 ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent its use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany. It was officially titled Decree Concerning Demolitions in the Reich Territory (Befehl betreffend Zerstörungsmaßnahmen im Reichsgebiet) and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor Nero, who, according to an apocryphal story, engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. The decree was deliberately disobeyed by Albert Speer.

As someone with family and friends there and has lived in Kyiv, this comment alone reveals you to be the kremlin propagandist you are. 

I've been to shithole countries. Brazil is a shithole country. I never traveled alone anywhere there because it was such a shithole. The world shithole literally applied in many cases to the downtown area. Open sewers, contaminated rivers, feral packs of dogs and cats covered in mange and starving to death. Constant sexual harassment. I saw 3 dead bodies while there. And people walking barefoot through all of it. In fact the constant stench of piss upon leaving the plane into Brazil was immediate and forever and one of the things I still sometimes shudder to remember.

Ukraine is no where near that. It had corruption, sure, but far less fucked up than Romania for example. Or Serbia. Actually surprising given the fact they have been so abused by the USSR. I'd say one of the best countries in the former USSR. Right up with Poland.

I went everywhere in Ukraine alone safely. Even jogging at night. Hardly any bad smells anywhere downtown (New York City arguably worse.) No homeless in the subways. People are kind. Never got cat called. I dropped money and people gave it back to me. They have some strays (stray dogs) but the strays are mostly tame and spayed and aren't starving to death (people feed them.)

Now onto the ""shaky history"" comment. What the fuck do you mean by this?  Its just such obvious, mean-spirited and broadly generalizing shade intended to make Ukrainian identity something you feel free to piss on.

Congress can name special prosecutors who can also lay down indictments, however that requires consensus among Congress to name a special prosecutor. If Republicans are in power, they will simply refuse to vote to have a special prosecutor.

Also, the IRS and US Postal service can also issue indictments. However, both of those are also under the executive branch, but the US Postal service has greater autonomy, because its governors can't be fired.",1647576489.0,1647576134.0,t3_tgp5w3,t1_i140snd,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

The point of the article really, and I believe some of the comments below, was specifically to do with what Putin’s objectives are now. I almost certainly agree it is to pull NATO proper into the war. 

Perpetrating acts of unbearable cruelty is a great way to evoke the emotion where anger overcomes rationality. This is the response Putin is desperately trying to evoke. 

He is going to try every low blow in the book and some new ones to try to enlarge this conflict. 

The good thing is that he’s running out of time. If the West can stomach some more desperate acts of criminal cruelty they can be relatively sure of Putin’s demise (one way or another). The stance of the Chinese is also paramount to the nature of outcomes).

,tgp5w3,i150np0,"Effectiveness is the relation between the invested resources and the achieved outcome.

Being smart for me is to make decisions that lead to a long lasting positive outcome. Positive in the meaning of life supporting.

Very hypothetical, very constructed and not very lifelike example: I can work hard to build a nuclear power plant in my backyard. I might achieve it, since somehow I dodged all the bureaucratic hurdles, gathered the required knowledge, gathered some plutonium, and achieved a stable reaction.

Does this make me smart? I surely have to have hughe amounts of knowledge to do so. I'd have to know much about radiation, shielding, sustained reaction, uranium and all the stuff required. And in the end I'd might winding up an expert on this stuff.

But again: does this mean I am smart? Having brought myself into a situation where one single, unforeseen event could very well lead to not only me losing my life but all people around me losing theirs as well. And for what purpose? To gain energy, where installing a couple solar panels and a buffer battery might achieve the same for me without much of a risk?

No, this isn't smart. One might even call me dumb, because all of my knowledge was poured into doing something that risked the life of my family, my neighbors families and my own life.

So just 'achieving what I want' is something I'd call only part of the equation. Since it completely shuts out the question of whether or not it is useful to want whatever it is you want. Does it support you and your family and your friends and your society in the short term and in the long run? Does it set a good example so people seeing you get inspired to try to achieve more with their own life? This is a very relevant part of what needs to be thought through before you invest yourself.

So for this Lavrov guy: He might have the means of talking to others in their own language. And he might be currently a somewhat big player on the international theatre unfolding around us. But does this make him smart?    

You can answer this by asking: what did he achieve with the toolset provided to him? Did he use his language skills to bring people together, to further the understanding and friendship between people, or did he use it solemnly for the purpose of his country or to be precise for the sole purpose of his puppet masters interest by dividing the people who had to listen to him, thus making understanding and friendship between the people much harder.

From my definition Lavrov can be called smart; not from yours. His actions are identical, however.

Say a situation was like this: make nuclear plant or freeze to death. What's smart here?
