The ministry said there has been a “notable decrease in overall Russian air activity” over Ukraine in recent days, noting it is likely due to the “unexpected effectiveness and endurance” of Ukrainian air defence forces.

The report also notes that the large Russian column north west of Kyiv has “made little progress in over a week” and is suffering “continued losses” at the hands of the Ukrainian armed forces.

“As casualties mount, Putin will be forced to draw from across Russian armed forces and other sources to replace losses,” the report adds.'",False,1646897361.0,t3_tamx9q,t3_tamx9q,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

MOSCOW, March 10. /TASS/. The Russian Federation is no longer going to participate in the Council of Europe, since the EU and NATO countries, unfriendly to Russia, continue the policy of destroying the Council and the common humanitarian and legal space in Europe. This is stated in a statement issued on Thursday by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

As noted in the diplomatic department, the EU and NATO states unfriendly to Russia, abusing their absolute majority in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, continue ""the policy of destroying the Council of Europe and the common humanitarian and legal space in Europe.""

""Russia will not participate in the transformation by NATO and obediently following the EU of the oldest European organization into another platform for incantations about Western superiority and narcissism. Let them enjoy communication with each other, without Russia,"" the ministry said.

Outside of the Ukrainian troops that have been holding their ground, they are joined by 22k soldiers( some of the best of the best are confirmed to be included) to defend the city at all costs.

Which is weird because that system was designed pretty much *specifically* to counter top-kill missiles like the javelin, because the slat armor and ERA that already existed stopped being effective with the advent of dual warhead munitions.

So was Arena a fabrication?  Did it just not work?  We've seen it on vehicles on parade and in demonstrations.  Was it just too expensive?

Equally interesting to think about previous comments between Xi and Putin. Total man crush on each other.

That story which was likely allowed by Chinese media to create the notion that Russia was being respectful and at the very least, China knew in advance. This is an acceptable view point for the Chinese.

But what if they more than knew about it, but were complicit in it. Building a financial toolbox to blunt sanctions, taking advantage of the chaos to further their agenda. Win win for the communist bros.

Key takeaways: 

The Kremlin has set informational conditions to blame Ukraine for a Russian-conducted or Russian-fabricated chemical or radiological false-flag attack against civilians as a pretext for further Russian escalation. The Kremlin is likely still evaluating this course of action but is building out the necessary conditions to justify broader violence against civilians. That risk must be addressed. The United States and NATO must “pre-bunk” such Kremlin efforts, destroy in advance Moscow’s efforts to create informational cover for escalation, and deter Russia’s potential use of a chemical or radiological weapon.

Recent Russian state media narratives have built upon a long-running Kremlin information operation to falsely claim that Ukraine, the United States, and NATO are plotting a chemical or radiological attack on Russia or Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. Russia may conduct or fabricate such an attack and blame Ukraine and NATO to justify additional aggression against Ukraine.  

The Kremlin may have initially intended its recent information operations to set conditions for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That invasion plan likely included conducting a false-flag operation against Donbas civilians and blaming Ukrainian forces, thereby justifying further military action (if only to the Russian population and credulous global partners). However, US and allied intelligence services “pre-bunked” many planned Russian false-flag attacks intended to justify the invasion, declassifying US intelligence of the planned Russian operations and sharing it with the media.[1] Such intelligence sharing likely forced President Vladimir Putin to choose between delaying or canceling the invasion and conducting it without informational cover. He chose the latter.

The Kremlin previously used claims of US and Ukrainian exploitation of eastern Ukraine to set conditions for its 2014 invasion of Crimea and proxy invasion of eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin has long falsely claimed that the United States and NATO maintain a ring of chemical or bioweapon facilities in post-Soviet states and has previously falsely accused the United Kingdom of preparing to conduct chemical weapons attacks within Ukraine.[2]

A lot of people seem to be making the crucial mistake of thinking that thousands of dead Russian soldiers will cause the Kremlin to blink. But Putin and his cronies don't give a shit, they'll just call up some of their 2 million reservists. This is going to be a long drawn out war where a lot of people are going to die in Ukraine, on both sides of the war, with a shitload of dead civilians along the way.

The idea of a negotiated peace seems to rile up a lot of people here, seemingly because they see the world in terms of good guys have to win, bad guys have to lose, so Russia getting any concessions is validating their bad behaviour. But negotiated peace with Ukraine giving in to some of the Russian demands is the best outcome for the future of Ukraine - the alternative is years of war that will destroy the country.

As the name suggests, it's literally called a ""commodity"" because each molecule within the product is interchangeable with the other.

Because of that there is a globally standard price. When you hear ""the oil price"" on TV, that's what it is. When supply goes up, all things equal, the price comes down.

People who say Keystone XL won't help prices don't understand how this market works. It doesn't matter where the oil _actually_ travels.

We operate under a capitalist system. Every market participant is making his/her own decision. Someone in Texas could sell the oil they receive from a pipeline for local use, or export it to Japan. Meanwhile someone in NY might be buying crude oil from the Saudi Arabia, someone from Michigan could be buying from a Canadian refinery via rail, and someone in LA might be buying bunker fuel from India.

Bottom line: More supply = lower prices. All other things equal. If there is more oil around, even if some of it goes to say Mexico, the price is still lower for an average driver in Oregon.

The idea that Russia is going to give up because the invasion hasn't gone as planned is naive, they are going to throw lives at this for months if not years.

There's a fantasy in the west that Putin will be overthrown due to the sanctions. I know Russians living in the EU, their families back in Russia blame the west for the sanctions, not Putin. They view the sanctions as western aggression that only confirms everything Putin said about the west's attitude to Russia, and is actually only serving to make support for the war more solid. Meanwhile, anti-war Russians are fleeing the country.

Russia will grind out this war for a long time, and every day they do, people die.

A seemingly boring article about the capabilities of a mobile hazardous materials unit that transitions into strongly implying future false flags of chemical, biological, and radioactive attacks. Including an appearance of the relative of the general who was killed in Kharkiv. Sadly I can't link due to reddit rules. 

 Some select google translated quotes, starting with the boring: 

 "" The newest field laboratory complex for research KLP-10 entered service with the troops of the RKhBZ of the Eastern Military District, the military department said.""

  ""Another unique mobile laboratory is PHL-2. The complex is able to determine up to 8 thousand chemical compounds. As Major General Valery Vasiliev told reporters earlier, the system consists of two modules.""

 ""The work of equipment of the RKhBZ troops acquires particular relevance in a special military operation in Ukraine, experts say. Recall that at the end of last year, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that American PMCs supplied poisonous substances to Ukrainian troops. 

As clarified  in the DPR, the chemical components are placed in 40-mm metal containers that can be used with UAVs and grenade launchers. At present, the fate of the chemical weapons delivered from the United States is unknown.

In addition, Kostikin drew attention to the issue of the security of Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure. As you know, the country has four nuclear power plants with 15 power units - Rivne, Khmelnytsky, South Ukrainian and Zaporozhye, which is considered the most powerful in Europe. Also there is the sarcophagus of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.""

"" As Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological Weapons, noted in an interview with RT, the Pentagon's biological laboratories deployed in Ukraine now pose a serious danger.

According to the Russian military department, which took possession of secret documents from Ukraine, more than three dozen research institutions were opened in the neighboring country by order of the US Department of Defense Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).

After the start of the special operation, the destruction of a part of biological pathogenic agents began, including the pathogens of plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases. So, in Lviv, more than 320 containers were liquidated: 232 with the causative agent of leptospirosis, 30 with tularemia, ten with brucellosis and five with plague.""
 
""“I hope that it will not come to the use of military viruses or bacteria against our military and civilians, but there is a risk of leakage of poisonous toxic substances, pathogens, bacteria, viruses. The RKhBZ troops have equipment to deal with the consequences of a leak, and the methodology for helping people in such situations is well developed, ”Nikulin explained.""",False,1646875346.0,t3_tamx9q,t3_tamx9q,,0,-8,0,-8,0,0,

They're lying: now they're exposed as liars and can't use their supposed anxieties about NATO as an excuse anymore

They're telling the truth: What's the downside? being part of NATO doesn't suddenly give them immunity or make it easier for them to invade others

I'm not sure I'd say it quite like that. The ""mess"", is *his* bombing of maternity wards and shelling evacuees waiting in line in what was supposed to be a cease-fire zone.

I would say ""how Russia got the world into this mess"".

The U.S might not be sending troops, but we are paying up the wazoo for gas and the mental health effects of witnessing a genocide is going to do a number on already the number 1 country with the most citizens on psychotrops in the world. Nevermind after the trauma from 4 years of orange wannabe dictator and then covid.

**WE** are all ""in this mess"". Putin created it.

And we aren't looking at a man who didn't anticipate the ""extreme sanctions"", in fact, I believe he was so happy to have gotten to go with his plan of NATO countries not intervening. Probably why he flew fireworks in Donetsk after his speech after invasion began.

If money quit flowing to the military complex, and fear is what creates the idealogy we need to have a military to protect ourselves because as evident as today, you never know.

Fear is a money making business, has been since all walks of mankind. As leader, have your sheeps captivated by fear, and they will give away everything including their rights to free speech, and more.  


Edit: I like to say as democrat freddy roosevelt and John Kennedy said, ""The only thing to fear is fear itself"". And mankind hasn't be able to understand how strong that quote means.

And considering the unsupported VDV assaults on Ukrainian airfields, the ""lightning raids"" that pushed quickly towards Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, etc, and all of the raids along Russian supply lines... it really wouldn't surprise me if the death count was high, and the wounded end up KIA too. ""Ukrainian propaganda; death count too high; somewhere in the middle"" was a common combo of phrases I saw a lot the last two weeks, but if the Russians can't retrieve the wounded then they can end up dead awfully quick too. Losing over a company of soldiers per day is decimation territory. **E**: I wouldn't be surprised if the truth was 'somewhere in the middle' of American and Ukrainian numbers. **/e**

>On 13 June 2013, the United States government publicly announced it had concluded that the Assad government had used limited amounts of chemical weapons on multiple occasions against rebel forces, killing 100 to 150 people. US officials stated that sarin was the agent used.[66] Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes did not say whether this showed that Syria had crossed the ""red line"" established by President Obama in August 2012. Rhodes stated: ""The president has said that the use of chemical weapons would change his calculus, and it has.""[67] The French government announced that its own tests confirmed US assertions.[68]

>Russian assessment

>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said ""the accusations of Damascus using chemical weapons put forth by the United States are not backed by credible facts.""[69] Lavrov further stated that the Syrian government had no motive to use chemical weapons since the government already maintained a military advantage over the rebel fighters.

Trump was elected because of the state of affair of rich American oligachy who sent factories overseas to China because it was cheaper than having to deal with a labor union or pay more in wages.

But one thing they do have is spirit, and if you have enough of that spirit channeling, it is a problem. They are just people that want to find meaningful purpose in life and most of that comes from the stigma of providing for a family and ability to do so by working in the said factories owned by American rich.

Now that they are gone, they can no longer afford what their parents used to be able pay for without a college degree, or specialization.

If that means levelling the country then so be it. It's a means to an end. If you turn off your morals and think like a dictator fighting for your life it does make sense.  

People seem to forget that Putin is a paranoid Soviet era KGB agent turned dictator. Wherever he looks he sees America and the CIA toppling dictators. He's really paranoid about America and the CIA coming for his head. Even if America isn't behind something he still thinks it is. Seeing Saddam Hussein tried and executed and then the manner Gaddafi died was just too much for Putin. Reports both inside and out of Russia say Putin obsessively played those videos over and over.  

When protests or calls for democracy come anywhere near the Kremlin the only thing he can think of is that America and the CIA are behind it all.  

From a dictators perspective, Ukraine was a terrible example for the Russian people. They may look at Ukraine and want a more open country too. And as for Nato, there's no way Putin will allow Nato to get too close to Russia.  

Putin will keep going until he wins. He has to as the stakes are too high for him to not continue through to the end goal. Ultimately, winning for him is simply not having Nato, America or democracy next to Russia.  

Imagine I have a priceless vase. Your goal is to take it from me. My goal is to stop you at any cost. All I need do is smash the vase and I win. That is exactly what Putin is doing.

* Seems pretty clear that older generations mostly watch state television, and have no real clue what's going on, beyond the state narrative. And, much like similar demographics most places, are pretty impervious to evidence or rational arguments that contradict their firmly held beliefs.
* It also seems pretty clear that, similar to rural places in many places, a lot of Russians who speak English and have a lot of awareness of what different places are like choose not to stay in that place.
* Those who do stay and object are far more persecuted than those in the West. Despite hyperbole about, say, the BLM protests, very few protestors risked anything close to what Russian protestors risk... which means a lot of people who disagree and stay in Russia keep their mouth shut. Which means they don't have a whole lot of influence.
* And finally, I'm sure like everywhere else, there are large numbers of people who just sort of go along with whatever it takes to get by, day-to-day. They might object a bit, in the same way people in the US might object to drone strikes against civilian targets while also not really making any real sacrifice to stop them, and being more interested in their own pet causes, ideologies and local issues than a big, abstract problem that doesn't directly affect them.

That doesn't mean that many will not still be mis-lead, mis-informed or deliberately choose lunatic fringe ideas and conspiracy theories over rational thought.

In a free-thinking society, this reduces down to a disenfranchised minority (they will always exist no matter what evidence you put in front of them e.g. flat-earthers).

With media censorship... the people get one narrative only. That narrative is directed by the will of the government of the day as needed to impart their goals. Any diversion from this narrative isn't even allowed to be made public (or worse, the instigator ends up ""missing"").

The later is becoming more difficult to impose with global internet access - unless you can build a virtual wall like China / North Korea (and soon Russia) and restrict access to media sources from the outside world.

The other way is to strangle the 'education' system so that is it less about 'critical thinking' and more about 'problem solving'. On top of this you can impose full authoritarian ideals so that no-one ever questions anyone in a position of authority without serious consequences.

That is how you impose your will and retain power and rule over 'the masses'... making use of them to do your bidding for the good of 'the country' (the greater good).

Choose your path...

PS: Some people and cultures (mostly non-Western) are honestly indoctrinated to believe the 'the greater good' and the sacrifices they must make for the community/country irrespective of the personal outcomes for them. Collectivist-leaning cultures (e.g. southern and eastern europeans, parts of asia, and africa/middle east) are more likely to be indoctrinated in this way. 

Hofstede - a social psychologist - has written extensively about this cultural dichotomy & it explains a lot about how we fail to understand each other as humans.

Borys Kremenetskyi, told The Associated Press on Tuesday after returning from a meeting at the Pentagon. “It can be ground-based air-defense systems. It can be fighter jets, whatever possible,” he said.
Ukraine also needs additional anti-tank, anti-armor weapons and coastal defense capabilities to defend against Russian ships in the south, he said.
The handover of Poland's 28 Soviet-made MiG-29s would signal Western resolve to do more for Ukraine. Militarily, however, the number of planes offered would make it unlikely to be a game-changer. And MiG-29s are inferior to more sophisticated Russian aircraft and could be easy prey for Russian pilots and Russian missiles.
A senior U.S. defense official has said Ukrainians are flying relatively few of their existing aircraft, for relatively little time, as it is. The defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. assessment, said it's possible that Ukraine does not need more planes and would benefit most from more of the weapons it uses effectively every day, including anti-aircraft Stinger and anti-tank Javelin missiles.

Sortie rates are vital in a campaign’s success. When you’re the invading force you can get away with a lower rate since the value of these sorties are more limited in scope. 

When dealing with an invading force however, they need to be coordinated, continuous, and work in conjunction with a much broader swath of the theater both in support, offensive, and defensive roles. They get a lot of use under these circumstances, and in order to be really effective they need to basically be unending.  This means you either have enough war fighters out there to do what needs to be done, or they get relegated to a backseat role and fewer may be better because they don’t have enough support or momentum to not just be extra targets.

Purchasing commodities is usually done against futures contracts which are usually acquired to lock-in a price at a future time for a commodity to minimize price fluctuation for the purchaser.

First off, the Keystone pipeline is less than 10% complete. Even if it were fully functioning, it would have significantly less capacity than Russia. Pipelines of that scope don’t just fall into place and are up and functioning next month, they take years.

Second, the notion that increasing the production of oil is going to have much of an affect on gas prices relies on two false premises: 1. That all markets will continue operating as if that oil is not being produced, and 2. that this increased production in oil will somehow not be countered by the Saudis and other OPEC members.

On point 1, numerous markets in the US *would actually see an increase in gas prices* as a result of the Keystone pipeline. Oil that otherwise makes its way to those markets form Canada get diverted to prop up the foreign markets receiving the oil from KXL. This isn’t speculation either, this is exactly what happened when the pipeline became partially operational, and that would only accelerate as more nations relied on it. 

On point 2, Saudi Arabia does not just stand by and let the US control oil supply. They never have and they never will, they will manipulate markets and supply to their ends as they have always done, which means if we increase oil supply, so do the Saudis, they flood the market, and then weaken US producers forcing them to either produce less or just straight up close shop until the market is profitable again.

Let’s go ahead and throw a point 3 in there too: we are currently producing less than we were 2 years ago. We can increase supply right now without Keystone, and in fact we are doing so, and strangely enough, it’s not really helping prices all that much.

So before WW2, Ukraine was an SSR. Stepan Bandera Ukrainian ultra-nationalist terrorist who was sentenced to death for assassinating the Polish Minister of the Interior, but got life in prison instead. When the Germans invaded Poland he was released, and the Germans recruited him to go to Ukraine and lead agitation in Ukraine against the USSR. He lead the OUNB (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Bandera faction) and helped form two battalions of Ukrainian OUNB members to fight with the germans against the soviets.

As the Germans invaded he tried to proclaim a Ukrainian state under the nazis, but they didn't like it and sent him to a concentration camp. The OUNB then lead mass atrocities and genocide there right along with nazi policy, and the members would eventually form Ukrainian Insurgent Army units that fought in the Soviet Union through the 50's. When the Soviets regained Ukraine, the Germans let him out again to again agitate against the Soviets.

After the war he escaped to West Germany, and was used by MI6 because he still had some contacts in anti-soviet circles in Ukraine. Both dropped him for being a psychopath, and when he started being used by the West German intelligence agency he was killed by soviet double agents. This is a pillar of Soviet and Russian propaganda that says the west worked with the Nazis.

These days there are people who remember Bandera as some rebel leader who fought for Ukrainian independence. They ignore, deny, or don't know that he was a monster. He has reportedly almost majority support in western Ukraine, but is despised in central and eastern ukraine, and by poles and russians (and anyone else who knows who he is, I'd never heard of him before last week). There is also lots of iconography that has survived in Ukrainian military groups from when they were organized under the nazis. There are lots of pictures of it on Ukrainian fighters shown in Russia, at least.

Point is that modern Banderites don't share the policies that made nazis monsters, like wanting genocide. They're just blind nationalists who chose basically the worst possible figure to revere. Imagine if George Washington committed genocide with the nazis and didn't actually win the war, become the first president, or accomplish anything. Russian propaganda loves it, and today Ukrainian nationalist basically means nazi in Russia.

Of course there are probably some actual neo-nazi-larping attention-seeker clowns too, like there are in any country, but the bigger problem, and the unique to Ukraine one, is Bandera.

 >The STEN (or Sten gun) is a family of British submachine guns chambered in 9×19mm which were used extensively by British and Commonwealth forces throughout World War II and the Korean War. They had a simple design and very low production cost, making them effective insurgency weapons for resistance groups, and they continue to see usage to this day by irregular military forces. The Sten served as the basis for the Sterling submachine gun, which replaced the Sten in British service until the 1990s, when it, and all other submachine guns, were replaced by the SA80.

 [Stinger Missile and ""Stinger effect""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Afghan_War#Stinger_Missile_and_""Stinger_effect"") 
 
 >Whether the introduction of the personal, portable, infrared-homing surface-to-air ""Stinger"" missile in September 1986 was a turning point in the war is disputed. Many Western military analysts credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war. Some military analysts considered it a ""game changer"" and coined the term ""Stinger effect"" to describe it. Wilson claimed that before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets, but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one.

Anyway it has to be pooled in what I imagine must be a large area for a long time. And kept at temp range of no more than  70 and no less than 50 the whole time, transporting too. And bottled and boxed. Sometimes when I'm being infused I imagine the ""factory"" as being bigger than city blocks. 

Other than my weird ass disease the use it to slow down the disease process of people with ALS and it almost doubles their life expectancy and halves the decline. That's significant when your 20 years from the end. 40 is way better. They use it in cancer treatment to use more aggressive chemo and get cancer that would have otherwise been unstoppable by immediately giving the person an clean perfect new immune system in a bottle directly after. And obviously many babies are bore with a genetic defect that effects one part of or the whole if their immune system. There is actually over 250 forms of Primary immunodeficiency, which is another less weird disease I also have. Back in the days when I was born they didn't test for it because there was nothing they could do. The babies didn't live very long. Now they live a full and normal life with as much autonomy and control as possible with self administered infusion of that stuff.

What do you mean by your second sentence? That's very confusing.

  
All Russian high schoolers, boys and girls, get introductory military training of some kind. 

Those who go on to university get more training (at least two months). Half of Russian university students are women (approximately). Russian military focuses on the ambitious and highly educated (much harder to get into university there).

  
So yeah, there are women in the Russian military, although it is, like ours, still very much male-dominated. Indeed, it's about the same percentages of active members.

//What is the men to women ratio in Russia? Does Russia army have women that serve? Because it might be easier for certain guys to get a relationship in Russia. I mean obviously not now, but once this blows over and we move on and we are buying oil and gas from Russia again//(the deleted question).

I think the west should send troops to Ukraine. Russia has clearly violated at least one, if not several treaties by invading Ukraine, so fuck ANY treaty that Russia ever signed. 

The only thing holding the west back is the threat of nukes, and I believe Putin is simply bluffing with those. He knows just as well as anyone that if nukes start flying, he is going to get the worst of it. On top of that, nukes have been a threat for 70 years now, and it hasnt happened yet. Even if the men in charge order it, i believe there is no way that order is going to make it down the chain of command. On top of THAT, there have been military conflicts between nuclear armed countries, and nukes didnt just start flying. 

The way I see it, Putin is a bully, plain and simple. And he has been bullying now for a while, and is geting more and more brazen. And the only what that I know of dealing with bullies, is beating them at their own game, and punching them square in the jaw. Sure, the sanctions will kick him in the shin, but realisticly, its not something that really hurts him. All that the west is doing is showing that they are going to take some half assed measures to punish him, but they arent willing to actually put their foot down and take a real stand. Yeah, the sanctions hurt the people and the army is badly equiped, but even a badly equiped army can still bomb hospitals and schools. 

So there's my alternative. Is it a good idea? Fuck me if I know, like I said, im not a military analyst or a intelligence agent who has any sot of information on russia.

Trump called Putin a genius because Putin knew the same politicians we see that go from middle class to millionaires in their position of power would not act or do anything about Ukraine like we are seeing today.

NATO implementing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would likely result in escalation, not de-escalation. That might be beneficial for your Kyiv outskirts family for a little while, but might ultimately lead to large-scale war, more indiscriminate bombing of civilians, use of higher-power bombs etc., and that's just consequences in Ukraine. 

An official war between Russia and NATO is not worth the risk. I'm obviously extremely saddened by this whole situation, and the deaths of Ukrainians is extremely distressing and disturbing at a vast distance, never mind what it must be like to live there. However, the West still has to be pragmatic in approaching the situation, and if that means ensnaring Russia with economic sanctions to minimise the overall death toll and attempt to de-escalate the war, then that's what has to happen. 

The failure of economic sanctions would be a failure of multilateralism, which has been the foundation of the most peaceful century in human history, setting an extremely dangerous precedent that would set us back a very, very long time. Unfortunately, Putin appears to be going for broke, and whilst that's a shame in terms of the limited power of economic sanctions, it also reaffirms that military intervention by NATO might not be the safest decision, given his scorched earth approach to this whole situation.",False,1646880075.0,t3_tamx9q,t1_i0215ly,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Your point that people expected him to invade is a literal example of a situation where it **would** have been a ""bad move"" to assume Putin was bluffing, which is why people did not assume so.

Given that the US rejected Poland's offer regarding jets, I'd say that they still feel that it's a bad move to assume he is bluffing.

 >Decimation (Latin: decimatio; decem = ""ten"") was a form of  Roman military discipline in which every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the Roman Army to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as cowardice, mutiny, desertion, and insubordination, and for pacification of rebellious legions. The word decimation is derived from Latin meaning ""removal of a tenth"". The procedure was an attempt to balance the need to punish serious offences with the realities of managing a large group of offenders.

What I mean by that is that in taking an absolute non-intervening stance, especially if Russia results to using chemical, biological, or tactical nuclear weapons within Ukraine (as has been rumored and publicized at length today) it's quite possible the cornerstone of century of safety you refer to is effectively gone for good.



The taboo against wars of territorial conquest was already broken 14 days ago.  Compounding that, if we stand idle while the Pandora's Box of NBCs is unleashed within Ukraine due to Russia's failure to secure a conventional victory, we may in time see a fundamental shift in global order the likes of which we haven't seen since World War II. 



 *Every* non-nuclear power will either seek nuclear weapons or an ironclad alignment with a power bloc that has them, because we will live in a world that has declared such nations free real estate for the countries with nuclear capability.   We might see mass migrations from ""unprotected"" nations to the existing power blocs, exacerbated by the already real possibility of climate change migration, which will put a strain on the traditional powers and their own stability.



 New power blocs that form might center around political axes that are on the fringes of the main power players today in regions often ignored by the West. Some of these nuclear powers may be even less responsible than Russia.  If WMDs are locally deployed and unanswered in our time, these powers may even feel reasonably bold about *using* these weapons, rather than simply keeping them as deterrence to maintain sovereignty.   Where might all these future nuclear states get the necessary materials?  Well, we're doing a great job destabilizing the country with the largest stockpile of such material right now, with its government predicted to default in a month. After all, when the Soviet Union fell, Russia remained... but a disturbing amount of nuclear material was never accounted for.



I'm not predicting chaos and Armageddon and the fall of Western civilization or anything, but it's not hard to imagine how the choices we make today can lead there, and it's safe to say that such a world would be more volatile and dangerous than the one we have enjoyed.  



Of course, none of this has happened yet and Russia hasn't employed NBCs.   But they've made it clear that they no longer feel like they benefit from the global system and thus do not feel beholden to its rules.  And what's another rule broken at this point?



It's a really tough set of choices our leaders are making, because we **need** to be firm about protecting the rules of the global system that has led us to an imperfect but unprecedented era of peace and prosperity, but not so firm we outright destroy that system ourselves.   I just hope we're not standing around, claiming we're protecting it, while our enemies have already broken the foundation upon which we stand.",1646884004.0,1646882988.0,t3_tamx9q,t1_i023nne,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Their hope lies in hitting has hard as they can for as long as they can in the current conventional warfare framework, but when that fails, in fierce resistance and insurgency. That's why Kyiv is being fortified and the citizenry is being armed.

The longer they can hit back with equal weapons - such as those in their arsenals and those they capture from Russia - the longer the delay before asymmetric warfare is necessary, pitting individuals against Russian heavy equipment. But thanks to western lethal aid, they are in a very good position to cause absolutely devastating losses to Russian heavy equipment in that sort of setting.

With the sheer number of man portable anti-tank weapons, as well as man portable anti-air, Russia will be facing the occupation of a country which is absolutely resolute in ridding itself of the invader - a country which will be brimming with committed and well supplied insurgents, likely with continued western support.

What Russia needs to do to avoid that grim outcome, is to avoid such a situation where Ukraine is under occupation. Whether by withdrawal - somewhat unlikely - or by reducing major population centers to rubble. That is what they are currently doing, and if they turn their artillery on Kyiv... it is much harder to resist the invader when you, and most of your territorial force has been turned into red mist on crumbling buildings.

After the US was called out by the UN for having a colony in the 50’s they gave Puerto Rico the right to have a constitution and elect their own governors. This was sold to the population as a path to independence which was not true.

The US decided to form a military base in one of the surrounding islands and kicked out a lot of people from their homes, and started testing bombs in the island and even accidentally killed someoen. The cancer rate in that island is way above the average cancer rate in the main island.

Puerto Rico has had multiple referendums over the political status, most of which have been pro staying the same but some of them have been pro statehood and have been ignored by the federal government for multiple reason.

The federal government refuses to set the terms for a binding referendum, and continues to ignore the will of the Pueroricans.

I think you would have a much stronger argument with regulation like utility companies have where they need to reach an agreement with the county/city/state (depends on location) on price increases.
