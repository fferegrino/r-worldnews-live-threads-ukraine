>  
>**Ukraine dismissed the deputy chief engineer of its Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, accusing him of collaborating with Moscow’s forces and treason, the Energoatom state nuclear energy company said.** The statement was published a day after Russia said it had promoted the engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, to serve as the director of the vast nuclear plant in southeastern Ukraine.  
>  
>**The US army awarded a $1.2bn contract to Raytheon Technologies Co for six national advanced surface-to-air missile systems (NASAMS) for Ukraine on Wednesday, the Pentagon said.** The United States has approved sending Ukraine a total of eight NASAMS to help fend off Russian missile and drone attacks.  
>  
>**The UN appealed for record funds for aid next year, AFP reports, as the Ukraine war and other conflicts, climate emergencies and the still-simmering pandemic push more people into crisis, and some towards famine.** The United Nations’ annual Global Humanitarian Overview estimated that 339 million people worldwide will need some form of emergency assistance next year – a staggering 65 million more people than the estimate a year ago.

>

Day 281 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, but there were a couple of missile launches from Belgorod, and at 12:20pm our air defenses were shooting something down in Kharkiv oblast. At around 11:20pm they fired 4 S-300 missiles at Chuhuiv and at least one of them directly hit an apartment building, completely destroying the 3 top floors. So far we only know about one person being injured, according to locals that building was mostly empty because most people left, which is why there weren’t more casualties. 

The expected massive missile strike didn’t happen today either, so I’m happy to have been proven wrong with my prediction. We still had one time where we thought that the missile strike is about to start, when Russian bombers flew out from an airbase in Belarus at 2:20pm. They were flying for about an hour and then returned back to Russia, after that the massive air raid alert stopped and that was it for the day.

Apparently they are still deciding on the best targets to strike and that’s why they still haven’t done the next big missile strike, but they continue to fly their bombers along our borders even when they don’t intend to launch missiles, so that we can’t relax. They also continue to shell anything that they can reach with their artillery, because they are shelling Kherson and Kupiansk basically every day, specifically targeting civilians. Yesterday they shelled an apartment building in Kherson, and today they hit an apartment building in Chuhuiv, civilian targets are definitely their priority, which is extremely stupid.

Putin is illogical (therefore who knows what the crazy madman might do, nukes, escalation, Concerns).

They also bless personal vehicles and do all the other voodoo doctor bullshit that's all been invented in the 1980s and 1990s. The closer you are to the centers of power, the more money you can make. The most lucrative business for Russian Orthodox priests is getting little old ladies to donate their apartments to the Church ""for their soul's salvation"" and taking their place for themselves when the old ladies pass away. There is an entire cluster of multimillionaires around the Patriarch's office in Moscow that all own countless apartments all over Russia.

There's a rule of thumb that you get 20/60/20 in Russia of fascist/apathetic/liberal, although I'm quite ready to believe it is more like 10/80/10, obviously depending on the region. In a city like Petersburg it might be more like 10/70/20. Still, the apathy is overpowering. 

Given that these political groupings shouldn't consider the whole population, only those old enough to have views on the matter, we can discount the younger. From Statista I see that 0-19 demographic accounts for 33.25 million people. I guess we can also assume that people over the age of 65 are unlikely to take part in violent uprisings (not impossible but I'd argue statistically negligible). That's another 23.45 million we can discount. Foreign populations are highly unlikely to participate in violent unrest too, so minus another 5.5 million (according to Russian ministry of internal affairs). 

So there are some 81.17 million Russians between 19-65 years of age. If we take the average of 10% being liberal, that's 8 million. The question is when to factor in the 700,000 Russians who fled after the announcement of war. I believe mostly liberal, but it's hard to put statistics on that. 

So on paper, if we go with the premise of 10/80/10, you might think that 8 million is enough to overcome the 1 million or so members of Putin's police state (Rosgvardiya/OMON/FSB/police).

One difference lies in that Ukraine had a much larger and established opposition which Russia doesn't have at all. There was an alternative for people to fight for, and the very reasonable belief that if they were successful, there was a government ready to step in and take over. In Russia, there is none of that. There are no leaders (they're all dead or in prison), there is no opposition government to support or take over. There is no way to organize action without having FSB bust your door down the same day and take you out of the picture. The whole system has been organized so that unrest disappears before it can gain any momentum at all, and that is very difficult to overcome. It's not certain that the Iranian protests will succeed, and I doubt they have a better police state than Russia. China is a better analogue. Does anyone in the west really think those poor Chinese guys have a chance of overthrowing their dictator?

Another problem I think though, is that Ukraine's ratio probably looked more like 1/39/60 (at a very rough guess). Certainly Ukraine had a MUCH larger number of people who were strongly anti-Yanukovich. When you've got the majority of the country on your side, it's much easier for spontaneous protests to appear in sufficient numbers to snowball into something huge. 

The amount of liberal people in Russia means you will get next to no spontaneous protests that can potentially snowball - no one wants to be the first to stand up in the centre and watch as almost everyone just walks by and police arrive quickly to make you change your mind. 

At the end of the day, I believe sadly (given the situation) that popular uprising won't happen until something pushes the apathetic towards one of these two sides, and that could easily go 50/50 to fascist / liberal camps.",False,1669894350.0,t3_z9dogo,t1_iyges2k,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Since the war a lot of major sites were blocked. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, BBC, and some others. Not hard to find VPNs to get around that though. 

Still, the main source of news for Russians who want to see something different from the usual state media bullshit has always been telegram. There are lots of good independent telegram channels that regularly post news, including from Ukraine - often I see stuff posted in those groups before I see it here. One of them, ""Lentach"" has almost half a million subscribers, to get an idea of how popular they are. They are kinda half-meme half-news - they usually throw in a meme with every news item and take the piss out of the Kremlin quite a lot. 

The problem isn't with access - if you want news, it's quite easy to find and get, and not dangerous at all just to read and consume. The problem is the majority are either brainwashed into chronic fear or skepticism of any foreign or anti-Kremlin sources, or simply too apathetic to care. It's not even that the Kremlin makes them distrust foreign media. As you can see with the circus show that is Solovyov and Simonyan, the intent is not to make Russians trust Russian media over foreign media - what they really do is even more sinister and effective: make them think that all media is absolutely shit, that Putin is the only mentally stable one who can keep things together, and make them disengage from politics and bury their heads in the sand.

Not sure how it makes sense.  Only a suicide bomber would make sense, but if that were a strategy UA was using it would be more common.  There are many factors that make it an interesting attack (the fuel train passing, the truck passing)  


Then you can consider, maybe the truck didn't know it was a bomb... but that seems even crazier.  Maybe the truck was full of explosives and it is a  freak accident. Or the truck was full of explosives and special forces had planted a small bomb on it.  


Regardless, to believe it was a truck bomb you have to believe a lot of complex things about something that could be more simply explained by a direct attack on the bridge.  So while it's not impossible, a simpler solution is it was attacked by a drone or other remote control munitions, timed to hit that spot when the train was crossing.  Timing the truck and the train to intersect on the bridge is definitely not an easy task especially if the truck doesn't know it's a bomb.

Gaining that momentum is key. I remember watching the Maidan back in 2014 and what impressed me was how quickly it snowballed, and how quickly it was basically over for Yanukovich, despite the atrocities he committed to desperately cling to power. If a spontaneous protest movement loses momentum for whatever reason, it's very difficult to get it back again, and people will be very wary to try it again. Belarus is a case in point. 

What helped Ukraine to succeed in 2014 was simply having such a huge part of the population clearly wanting change. I don't mean it to diminish the heroes who died fighting for this freedom, but with that much of the population against Yanukovich, it was inevitable that the protest movement would snowball and I suspect not even Moscow rolling in military support to Yanukovich would've helped.

I'd believe maybe 20% have negative views of him, perhaps 5% would protest against him if it were safe to do so, and how many willing to risk their lives to fight against him? Well, they already did, and we can count them, and it was only in the tens of thousands.
