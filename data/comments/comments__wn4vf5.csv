Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 13 August 2022
 


- The two primary road bridges giving access to the pocket of Russian occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnipro in Kherson Oblast are now probably out of use for the purposes of substantial military resupply.

- On 10 August 2022, Ukrainian precision strikes likely rendered the road crossing of the Dnipro River at Nova Kakhovka unusable for heavy military vehicles. In recent days, Russia has only succeeded in making superficial repairs to the damaged Antonivsky road bridge which likely remains structurally undermined. Last week, the main rail bridge near Kherson was also further damaged. Since late July 2022, Russia has been using a pontoon ferry near the railway bridge as its main military resupply route.

- Even if Russia manages to make significant repairs to the bridges, they will remain a key vulnerability. Ground resupply for the several thousand Russian troops on the west bank is almost certainly reliant on just two pontoon ferry crossing points. With their supply chain constrained, the size of any stockpiles Russia has managed to establish on the west bank is likely to be a key factor in the force's endurance.

The U.S. think tank confirmed that Ukrainian forces destroyed the last bridge near Kakhova Hydroelectric Power Plant in Kherson Oblast, which Russian forces used to move military equipment. 

Ukrainian forces also struck Russian ammunition depots and logistics points in Kherson Oblast. 

The ISW suggests that Ukrainian partisans are likely targeting Russian proxies and pro-Russian collaborators to sabotage the upcoming sham referenda in temporarily occupied regions.

Day 171 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled at least once, at around 7pm, but thankfully there were no casualties, and it’s unknown if anything was destroyed by it. Then at 8pm people started seeing illumination munitions falling to the ground on the outskirts of the city, I’m not sure if regular shelling followed after it, but there was at least one more explosion reported after it.

There was a missile strike today as well, but it was pretty weird, because they only fired 2 missiles instead of the usual 4, which means it could have been Iskander this time, the crater is also pretty big, so I can’t be certain what missile it was. I’m not sure where the missiles landed, but it was most likely in Kharklv oblast, and not in the city, the explosions were pretty distant sounding.

I don’t know what they were targeting, but they destroyed part of the road and a couple of cars, it also looks like the missile landed within 30-50 meters from residential buildings, so most windows were most likely shattered. Yesterday their target was most likely yet another college, but I’m not exactly sure, as the missile landed about 20 meters from it and destroyed a part of the road. That part of the road had one of the central heating pipelines, which was damaged in the strike. 

This makes me wonder if they aimed at the college and just missed, which is a possibility. Educational institutions are their usual targets, so they could have just missed and hit a heating pipeline instead. But they could’ve also actually aimed at that pipeline and not the college, though that it probably less likely.

""The prevalence of imported Russian labor in occupied regions of Ukraine suggests that Russian occupation authorities are struggling to persuade or forcibly coerce meaningful numbers of Ukrainian residents to work on reconstruction projects and may fit into the wider Kremlin campaign of population displacement by importing Russian citizens to Ukraine with promises of financial compensation. However, consistent reports that such Russian citizens have not been paid for their work in occupied areas of Ukraine indicate that occupation administrations lack coherent plans and financial backing from the Kremlin to carry out occupation agendas beyond employing Russians to work on service projects. Russian-backed occupation administrations are likely facing internal fragmentation over occupation agendas, as ISW has previously noted, which are likely exacerbated by a lack of direction and support from the Kremlin.[37]""

A few thoughts based on armchair strategy:

1. It isn't necessarily true that the locals...""can't""...do the labor. It may be more of a sign that the occupying force either doesn't trust the local forces or lack the capacity to ensure the work is done correctly given the likelihood that a partisan or twenty might get in (or just normal ""doesn't work like we'd like,"" but let's be honest it's about partisans). Given the talk of partisans, there are likely many Ukrainians who would happily join the labor force because it's one way to properly sabotage it when no one is looking...and Russia can't devote the troops or police forces to do this properly.

2. If the imported workers are not getting paid, then it suggests another reason the occupiers are importing the workers instead of spending troops on making sure the labor is done correctly or, ahem, ""making sure the work is done correctly."" Even supposing there are Ukranians who need the cash or something, if the Russians can't give proper recompense then they risk transforming willing workers into partisans...with **much** better access to places to sabotage then they would have from the outside.

Given that Russia apparently can't pay its **own people** to go into a **dangerous warzone** while the country is **still** either stagnating or shrinking, it suggests plenty of difficult things about what is going on with Russia. It's either",False,1660443453.0,t3_wn4vf5,t1_ik76bx3,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

They are honest/blunt in their interviews, like how the vast majority remaining there is delusional, wholly-projecting, Russo-bots—they do print the wackadoodle “Ukraine caused this, now let me go drink my rainwater and eat some fried rats the Russians kindly provide”....but when they finally encounter a pro-UA resident in the city, you can tell the author is rejoicing.  [and it’s clear from those who’ve escaped—no this delusional thinking is not bc the Russians stand there with weapons or afraid of being reported.  One steel factory engineer estimated that prior to war, it was 60/40 pro-Russia, but now, all the pro-u folks seem to have either been killed or have fled, and it’s 95% pro-R derangement, and it’s like being in an alternate reality, a widespread Stockholm situation. He gave an example of FSB going door to door, searching and brutalizing, and when completed building, several ladies took a table outside and brought them their few morsels of food—he watched from window, dumbfounded how victims feed their last bits to their brutalizer, who dined liked entitled savages...but that he saw more and more of this backwards loyalty. Until he decided to risk being filtered (men often seized to fight or be tortured) but got thru Russia and out.]

If you haven't watched any russian news footage since this began I can understand your confusion. The russian media is portraying this as a war against that scary evil empire ""The WEST"" that must be stopped at all cost before the Western Nazi Scourge arrives and eats the russian children. Imagine Fox News but on steroids and acid. This is some heady delusional shit where russia is the last hope to save the world from evil and Ukraine's army has magical soldiers engineered in American funded biolabs. I'm not shitting you this is the boogeyman they've created but there is 0 evidence to backup their insane claims so they have to manufacture propaganda that supports their storyline (Here's your proof! Only an insanely evil empire (Ukraine, the West, NATO) would shell a nuclear power plant, russians would never do that we are far too civilized.) 


3 plausible reasons for this storyline immediately come to mind:

1. Justifying a more overt conscription at home

2. Blackmailing Ukraine's allies into forcing a negotiated end to russia's genocidal war so Putin can claim some territory and a victory

3. Forcing an actual boots on the ground intervention to which he can again point as proof of the evil Western Empire of Freedom and Democracy plans to invade russia

If Russia cuts off cooling to the reactors, they could absolutely cause it to explode. When the core reaches 1500 degrees C, the zirconium cladding will begin to trigger hydrolysis in the coolant water (which would be steam).  This releases hydrogen and oxygen, which, at that temperature - will explode. 

https://www.nuclear-power.com/nuclear-power-plant/nuclear-fuel/fuel-assembly/fuel-cladding-cladding-tube/high-temperature-steam-oxidation-of-zirconium-alloys/

They don't need to penetrate the concrete shell. All they have to do is cut the cooling water, or disable the pumps. This could EASILY happen accidentally in their fighting. 

These hydrogen explosions would not be as bad as Chornobyl. But this is basically how Fukushima's reactors exploded. Then melted down, as the damaged cores could no longer be cooled.  It is also true that these reactors have secondary containment (the concrete buildings) which are designed to contain a steam explosion, but could possibly be destroyed by the hydrogen explosion. (Example: Three Mile Island nuclear disaster had a hydrogen explosion but the secondary containment kept it inside the facility; cooling remained intact and the cores only partially melted down). 

I am not trying to fearmonger, but the longer the Russians remain in control at that plant, the higher probability that something like this could happen. 

The article makes some good points that it's very much in Russia's interest to not damage this plant, as long as they remain in Crimea. Once they're forced out of Crimea, they may attempt to deliberately destroy the facility to deny the enemy possession.  This plant must be taken by Ukraine (as well as the Dam) before Russia is forced out of Crimea.

,wn4vf5,ik4ktg2,"> Russia will continue to advance until they don't anymore. When Ukraine starts to advance, it will build momentum.

If Ukraine will keep pulling back instead of holding the line, then Russia has enough resources to advance all the way to the western border if they want to. They have a history of putting troops through the meatgrinder and STILL coming out on top. Keep in mind that it is harder to regain territory than it is to lose it, provided the occupying troops aren't complete simpletons and there are enough of them.

Even if Russia has to dig out all their mothballed equipment (and Russia has a fuckton of it), unless Ukraine can start getting a substantially superior kill rate, it will be very difficult or next to impossible to stop the Russians from advancing. With their updated objectives, the Russians don't need to advance all the way to the west. They just need to convince the Ukrainians that they cannot possibly recapture all of the territories already lost.

Keep in mind that for all the counteroffensives Ukraine has made, they've as of yet been unable to show strong results in reclaiming vast swathes of Donbas. Maybe this will happen in the late future, but at the moment nobody in the military establishment of Ukraine's western partners believes that to be true. Just look at what the British are saying in public.

This is why Zelensky has to put so much effort and energy to keep his nation's spirit strong, including being combative with his western partners when it benefits his country, lest his troops lose confidence or NATO/Western governments give up.

Remember that Russia are firing indiscriminately, including at civilians. It inflicts terror on the Ukrainian civilian population and hurts their morale. Depending on how much contact Ukrainian troops have with their families there is a real risk that this could translate to morale damage to the forces as well. Obviously some will be motivated even more to fight more fiercely against the Russians, but the opposite is true as well.

Poutine is determined to push ahead with this conflict for as long as he can, and Zelensky has to keep the morale of his countrymen up as the war's grind continues. The west is training and supplying Ukrainian ground forces a lot, and it's helping, but in the end Ukraine has a significant disadvantage in the total available manpower during a war of attrition. Which is why it is important to make Russia's manpower useless in this fight if Ukraine is to win.

The actual weakest link in the Russian force structure is their air force, which has underperformed severely. It is frankly embarrassing that with such a huge numerical advantage they have failed to overwhelm Ukraine's skies. They are showing the capability to conduct deep strikes against NATO arms convoys but not at a large enough rate given their stated capabilities.",1660398639.0,1660397975.0,t3_wn4vf5,t1_ik4716h,,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,

That's just Stalingrad's Russian battlefield dead that have not been recovered from mass and battlefield graves, and the missing and lost soldiers that remained where they fell.

In some cases they recover German and Russian soldiers, [not properly buried but covered by ground where they died] basically on top of each other.

The current doctrine is softening the Russians before an actual liberation campaign, using long-range bombardment to reduce Russia's force multipliers, while improving combined arms capacity (reclaiming the skies). This is straight out of a western playbook, while still utilising the more Soviet style of pushing wide and probing weak points for salients.

Russia is losing *valuable* resources (troops and equipment), while Ukraine is walking backwards (not to downplay their losses either, but it's a clear defensive strategy).

Ukraine is actually fighting this war like it could take a long time, while Russia is trying to speedrun (poorly).

>The actual weakest link in the Russian force structure is their air force, which has underperformed severely. It is frankly embarrassing that with such a huge numerical advantage they have failed to overwhelm Ukraine's skies. They are showing the capability to conduct deep strikes against NATO arms convoys but not at a large enough rate given their stated capabilities.

Russia tried to emulate a western combined arms style and fucked it up badly with their heavily centralised command structure (and lack of experience). Then they returned to WW1 style tactics of meatgrinders and artillery bombardments, and terror campaigns. There is a *huge* reason we don't use such tactics in 2022, and part of that is the reason Ukraine has been able to hold its own against a vastly superior opponent.

One of those reasons is the fact that supply dumps and command centres can be hit well and truly behind enemy lines, exactly as we've been seeing. Another is technology advances, the difference between a single quick-fire launch to wipe out said command centre before moving again, versus a day of indiscriminate shelling to advance a few kms.

As I said, Russia will advance right up until it stalls out. Ukraine, on the other hand, will progressively speed up as it builds momentum.

Ukraine's biggest challenge is going to be liberating cities and fighting amongst them, which is why they're targeting supply routes instead. Much easier to take a city if you starve them out than it is to fight building to building.",False,1660400064.0,t3_wn4vf5,t1_ik4ktg2,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Do some shuffling of efforts. Install as many heat pumps as can be installed in areas that will have the gas shortages. Converting appliances from gas to propane is relatively cheap and can be done quickly.  This does not work ""everywhere"". It is an option for knocking down the gas consumption by percentages.  

Then obviously conserve.  No one is even close to freezing to death.  40% less heating means the house is uncomfortable but way above temperatures fir frozen pipes.  

Industrial use of gas to make cheese means Germans will have to decide between 40% thinner slices, no cheese on Tuesday and Thursday, or using that mysterious orange block of Kraft product imported from USA.  Or 40% of Germans could go vegan over the winter.  If that is too stressful some of the cheesemakers can switch to propane or diesel burners.",False,1660396169.0,t3_wn4vf5,t1_ik4dfv2,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

,wn4vf5,ik4vok9,">The current doctrine is softening the Russians before an actual liberation campaign, using long-range bombardment to reduce Russia's force multipliers, while improving combined arms capacity (reclaiming the skies). This is straight out of a western playbook, while still utilising the more Soviet style of pushing wide and probing weak points for salients.

>Russia is losing valuable resources (troops and equipment), while Ukraine is walking backwards (not to downplay their losses either, but it's a clear defensive strategy).

>Ukraine is actually fighting this war like it could take a long time, while Russia is trying to speedrun (poorly).

The problem is, how certain can you be about halting Russia's advance? There has to be a line beyond which Ukraine cannot afford to retreat, if only for the psychological value.

Another thing is that Ukraine's losses are more valuable because of their smaller manpower base. Even if Russia is losing 400-500 troops a day, and Ukraine is losing 200-300 a day, Russia has a much bigger pool to draw from. They are not averse to using low quality troops as cannon fodder to preserve the effectiveness of the higher quality troops at their disposal.

The fighting itself is also giving valuable combat experience to the survivors on both sides. But to the retreating Ukrainians, especially the rank and file line infantry, it will look like a losing proposition if they keep walking back and fail to hold territories that their counteroffensives retake.

>Russia tried to emulate a western combined arms style and fucked it up badly with their heavily centralised command structure (and lack of experience). Then they returned to WW1 style tactics of meatgrinders and artillery bombardments, and terror campaigns. There is a huge reason we don't use such tactics in 2022, and part of that is the reason Ukraine has been able to hold its own against a vastly superior opponent.

A long drawn out fight will give lessons to the surviving forces, making a counteroffensive much harder to conduct as the fighting gets long and drawn out. Like you rightly point out in the next paragraph, command effectiveness and logistics will be key.

>One of those reasons is the fact that supply dumps and command centres can be hit well and truly behind enemy lines, exactly as we've been seeing. Another is technology advances, the difference between a single quick-fire launch to wipe out said command centre before moving again, versus a day of indiscriminate shelling to advance a few kms.

Indeed, Ukraine has precision weapons to hit weak points, and that hurts Russia's ability to *advance*. But it doesn't mean much when Ukraine has to actually do the hard work of driving out the Russians. Ukraine has had to destroy a lot of infrastructure like bridges, rail tracks etc to slow the Russians down. The same will be an impediment when they change to a proper offensive posture. They will be relying on weakened Russian morale, which may or may not happen with the way Russia is controlling information to their people and troops. There is a real ""only Russia cares about Russia"" or ""the west aims to destroy Russia"" mentality going on which makes many willing to accept the hardships that this war brings. Some also have this false sense of manifest destiny about the second (third?) coming of the Russian Empire and believe that losing troops is a given during war.

So far there has been little evidence of Ukraine being able to disrupt Russian logistics (since they stopped the stupid columnar force thrust to Kiev/Kyiv) to such a degree that it makes them ineffective in holding their ground. Yes there are plenty of ammo dumps and command centres being hit, but we've yet to see the rumblings of a structural collapse of the Russian forces' ability to command and control their holding troops. A lot of the perception you see in western populations is because of the asymmetric coverage of the combat taking place every single day/hour in the Ukrainian front. You don't even get real news of Russian advances until they're within a few kilometres of their objectives.

>As I said, Russia will advance right up until it stalls out. Ukraine, on the other hand, will progressively speed up as it builds momentum.

The real question is, how long until it stalls out? Russia could at any point decide ""we've conquered all the territory we wanted"" and then simply move to a reinforcing posture. Or, Russia could force Ukraine to walk back to the farthest lines Ukraine is willing to walk back to. This would mean Russia can force Ukraine to commit more troops to holding the line, which would take away precious resources they would want when they finally go on a real offensive.

>Ukraine's biggest challenge is going to be liberating cities and fighting amongst them, which is why they're targeting supply routes instead. Much easier to take a city if you starve them out than it is to fight building to building.

Yes, being able to isolate and besiege cities will be key to any Ukrainian victory, but they do have this risk that the cornered rat will fight even more fiercely, and they also have the risk of Ukrainian civilians getting caught in the middle, either as ransom by Russia or simply as collateral damage. In many places the Ukrainians have indeed evacuated their people, but you will always have the stubborn or the unable who will stay put.

Roughly speaking, I would say the bigger cities. Kharkiv is the one I keep the closest eye on.

>Another thing is that Ukraine's losses are more valuable because of their smaller manpower base. Even if Russia is losing 400-500 troops a day, and Ukraine is losing 200-300 a day, Russia has a much bigger pool to draw from.

This is simply not true. Ukraine is fully mobilised while Russia has not; Russia is using an invading army of limited personnel (and pulling from their other theatres) while Ukraine has a combination of military and partisans active. Ukraine is fighting an existential threat while Russians are fighting for an imperialist ambition.

>They are not averse to using low quality troops as cannon fodder to preserve the effectiveness of the higher quality troops at their disposal.

This worked in WW2, with millions mobilised in a defensive war, but it's a terrible idea now. Ukrainian troops are coming online with months of training, including international expertise, while Russia's recruits are coming in with fuck all training and dying in droves. Again, such a strategy works well for a quick campaign, when you're rushing the enemy, but it's a terrible idea in a drawn-out conflict. Force multipliers make cannon fodder simply useless (beyond a very specific early advantage), look at what happened when Wagner tried to attack US forces.

> But to the retreating Ukrainians, especially the rank and file line infantry, it will look like a losing proposition if they keep walking back and fail to hold territories that their counteroffensives retake.

This was clear when Ukrainian soldiers were stuck in the Severodonetsk salient (with strained logistics), but Ukraine is also winning battles and counter-attacks across multiple theatres. There was a good write-up the other day about how ""no significant territory changed hands"" looks in action, including defence-in-depth to preserve troops followed by counter-attacks to push back and rout invading forces.

>Indeed, Ukraine has precision weapons to hit weak points, and that hurts Russia's ability to advance. But it doesn't mean much when Ukraine has to actually do the hard work of driving out the Russians.

Disrupting command centres is critical in softening enemy positions, just look at how many times that one airport has been hit (for example). Keeping Russian forces scattered, uncoordinated and ill-equipped is absolutely going to help dislodge them when the time comes to push. Russia is playing by a very specific playbook to advance, which will fall apart (like it did in Kyiv) when they have to adapt defensively. And their army and doctrine is not well-equipped for tactical adaptation, which is why their movements are telegraphed so far in advance.

So far, Russia has had to grind for every inch of territory, while Ukraine has been popping up in different theatres across the battle lines. Mobility is a key concept that is missed entirely if you only see ""but Russia advanced in their single advancing spearhead"". Russia currently does not have a single clear salient; Ukraine has multiple.

>The real question is, how long until it stalls out? Russia could at any point decide ""we've conquered all the territory we wanted"" and then simply move to a reinforcing posture.

That would be progress from the current phase of the war. That will mean Ukraine can focus on liberating rather than splitting between offence and defence across the theatre.

>Or, Russia could force Ukraine to walk back to the farthest lines Ukraine is willing to walk back to.

A few months ago they were literally pushed back to their capital. Russia has a *long* way to go to push them back to their farthest line, especially at the rate Russia is advancing. And even if they were true, what would Ukraine even do to stop the advancing? Surrender? Fighting is literally their only option, especially when Russia will only consider peace talks when they lose their advantages.

>they do have this risk that the cornered rat will fight even more fiercely, and they also have the risk of Ukrainian civilians getting caught in the middle, either as ransom by Russia or simply as collateral damage.

This is exactly why we won't see a frontal assault on Kherson anytime soon (which no doubt will convince people like yourself that Ukraine can't liberate territory). Ukraine is disrupting bridges from being able to transport heavy equipment, they are not preventing personnel and civilians from being able to leave. Russian forces are not cornered in Kherson, they can still retreat. What they can't do (at least at similar levels) is resupply.

>In some places, especially early on, Ukraine did fail to move their people out. Which is why you get reports of children being kidnapped or Ukrainian civilians being forcefully relocated to Russia.

Let's get something clear here. The reason we get reports of children being kidnapped or Ukrainian civilians being forcefully relocated is because Russia is kidnapping children and forcibly relocating Ukrainians.

In the early days of the war, civilians clearly marked their presence to discourage Russian attacks; it had the opposite effect. The early days you reference were during a blitz siege, for an invasion that wasn't supposed to happen (even though we knew it would, most didn't believe the US info dumps or thought they would be enough to discourage Russia from invading).

I strongly encourage you to watch a detailed breakdown of Desert Storm. It will give you a solid understanding of how a coalition combined arms doctrine operates. The timescale will be much larger in this case because Ukraine has to win back their skies, they have limited equipment and personnel, and they are still fighting off the original invasion. But the concepts are very similar, and Ukraine is clearly playing to a similar playbook (it's a hybrid between doctrines).

Ukraine is slowly reclaiming the sky, and armoured vehicles are finally starting to be sent, and recruits are coming online. Ukraine's combat effectiveness has increased substantially in the last 6 months, while Russia's has become an embarrassment whose biggest achievement today was entering a metropolitan area (potentially taking it, currently unconfirmed).

Your entire argument boils down to ""Russia is still advancing in some places, western media isn't telling the full story, and liberating territory is harder than defending it"". Yes, all 3 of those things are true when you're versing a superior military foe who bum-rushed your country, and now lobbies thousands of artillery strikes forward before sending in cannon fodder.
