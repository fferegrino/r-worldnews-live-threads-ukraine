Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 28 February 2023  


* On 19 January 2023, amateur aircraft spotters observed a Russian A-50 MAINSTAY Airborne Early Warning (AEW) System accompanied by two MIG-31K FOXHOUND fighters departing from Machulishchy air base, Belarus.  

* Participating in joint Russian-Belarusian air drills between 16 January and 1 February 2023.  

* On 26 February 2023, Belarusian partisan group BYPOL and exiled opposition leaders reported an A-50 MAINSTAY had sustained damaged from Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attacks at Maschulishchy air base.  

* BYPOL reported two explosions and damage to the front and middle sections of the A-50 MAINSTAY as well as the radar antenna.  

* The A-50 MAINSTAY is a Russian airborne early warning and control platform. Its role is to build a recognised air picture and to provide coordination to adjoining fighter aircraft.  

* Attribution and damage has not been officially corroborated. However, the loss of an A-50 MAINSTAY would be significant as it is critical to Russian air operations for providing an air battlespace picture.  

* This will likely leave 6 operational A-50s in service, further constraining Russian air operations.

I got the numbers from The Kyiv Independent's daily reports on the indicative estimates of Russia’s combat losses, according to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. I looked at every single one of those twitter posts.

So what is this graph counting?

In the first days of war, a numerical report from The Kyiv Independent mentioned an ""updated numbers of Russia's casualties and other losses"", such as planes, helicopters, tanks, etc. Then the term ""losses"" was solely mentioned afterword in their daily updates. I first thought that was that, but later on, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine began reporting the personnel loss as ""liquidated personnel"" in their Total Russian Losses reports. ""Liquidated personnel"" sounds like ""killed troops"" to me, but I don't know if the term ""liquidated personnel"" has been prohibited in describing other personnel, such as the severely wounded personnel unable to fight.

Also note that war is chaos, and the fog of war is thick. People are dying and all belligerents might present propaganda to gain any advantage in their cause. Concerning these numbers, Ukraine might inflate the numbers to increase morale or they might fail to confirm and record all Russian casualties and deaths. I don't know.

But,... ""Elsewhere, UK intelligence officials have estimated that Russian regular forces and Wagner troops may have suffered between 175,000-200,000 casualties - including 40,000-60,000 deaths.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-64685428?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANG

So if these numbers released by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine are including Russian casualties, MoD could actually be publishing a conservative estimate. I'm not sure if all casualties is included though.

The first days of war appear hectic in record keeping (like seven times when the total recorded Russian troop casualties wasn't changed). The big white peak you see is 3160 Russian troop loss in one day, according to the March 3rd update. The day before was only 130. Maybe a backlog? I don't know.

Record keeping seems to shape up in March 16.

The increase in losses seen in September could be due to the big collapse of the Russian front in Kharkiv.

The increase in November could be due to Russia's retreat from Kherson.

Now apparently the Russian military is sending a huge wave of troops into Bakhmut, with much higher losses.

Also, I think it's wrong to say both sides are the same, and the Kremlin's 6000 reported Russian deaths seems waaaay more inaccurate than Ukraine, in my opinion.",1677566983.0,1677565369.0,t3_11dxmrx,t3_11dxmrx,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

Day 369-370 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were mostly quiet, or at least they were up until just now. There were no missile or drone strikes, but about 40 minutes ago we got reports saying that some Shaheds are heading our way, not sure how many of them exactly, but it’s at least 4 of them, and apparently, they are heading to Chernihiv, which means they are probably aimed at Kyiv, and also some drones are headed in the direction of Sumy.

All those drone strikes on Russian territory in the recent days have been very refreshing to see. Finally, there’s some real action after our forces were hyping up new long-range attack drones being developed and tested in the past couple of months. There was a confirmed hit on an oil refinery in Tuapse, then there was a drone that fell down in Belgorod, but didn’t explode, and some drones were also spotted near Moskov and even close to the St. Petersburg. 

There was also that hit on the airbase in Yeysk that happened just recently, it was probably done by a drone as well, but some Russians believe that they were hit by a missile. The problem with that is we (probably) don’t have any missile that could reach there, even though it’s not actually that far away. It’s only about 130-140km away from the outskirts of Vuhledar, which means GLSDB would easily reach it, that is, if we actually have them already, which is possible, but we had no official confirmations about it yet, other than some rumors surrounding some of our recent strikes on Mariupol.",False,1677619388.0,t3_11dxmrx,t3_11dxmrx,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia is open to negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine, but stressed that Moscow ""will never compromise"" on what he called the new ""territorial reality"".

Speaking at a press conference, Peskov told reporters that Moscow will not relinquish its claims to four Ukrainian regions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson) that Vladimir Putin annexed in September 2022. Parts of those areas were subsequently recaptured by the Ukrainians. None of the four regions is completely under Russian control.
For example, Peskov stated: 'There are certain realities that have already become an internal factor. I mean the new areas. The Constitution of the Russian Federation exists and cannot be ignored. Russia will never be able to compromise on this, these are important realities. With a favorable course of events and the right attitude of the Ukrainians, this can be resolved at the negotiating table. But the most important thing is that we achieve our goals.'

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday ordered officials to tighten control of the border with Ukraine after a spate of drone attacks that Russian authorities blamed on Kyiv delivered a new challenge to Moscow more than a year after its full-scale invasion of its neighbor. One drone crashed just 100 kilometers (60 miles) away from Moscow in an alarming development for Russian defenses.

The drone attacks caused no casualties but provoked a security stir as the war with Kyiv stretched into its second year last week.

A drone fell near the village of Gubastovo, 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow, Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the region surrounding the Russian capital, said in an online statement. The drone didn’t inflict any damage, Vorobyov said. He didn’t specifically describe the drone as Ukrainian, but said that it likely targeted “a civilian infrastructure object.”

Im canadian but haven't lived there for 7 years. I have no life there, no connections, nowhere to stay. I've been living in Ukraine most of my twenties. And the war blew up my whole life. I lost everything. And when it started I tried moving to Bulgaria which honestly just lead to me losing even more. I even had to re-home my cat because I'm basically homeless now. 

I don't have enough teaching hours to pay the bills, I'm broke as fuck, my education plans have been put on hold again. I'm exhausted constantly.

I'm staying in a friend's spare room but I've gotta be out in a few weeks. I have nowhere to go and no money.

Because I'm a Canadian citizen I understandably don't qualify for refugee benefits, despite having built my entire life in Ukraine since I was 21.

In a recent paywalled article Julia Ioffe wrote that even the elites in Russia believe the propaganda. Julia thinks that the Kremlin and even Putin himself believe their own propaganda.  

When speaking to some of her contacts amongst the elites and Kremlin insiders in Russia they seemed totally divorced from the reality of what is truly happening.  

They are that far removed from reality that when they spoke of some of the peace plan ideas they had heard floating around in their own circles (away from Putin!) Julia was shocked.  

There is a sense amongst the Russian people that America, the west and NATO are attacking not just Putin and Russia but the Russian people themselves. I get the feeling from reading the article that they think Russia is more powerful than it truly is.  

The elites don't know what Putin's plan is. That can make them uneasy, but they have no say in the matter so they just carry on. Many of them cannot leave Russia for fear of being arrested so they are resigned to their fate. As someone told Julia “Like it or not, we don’t decide anything. Only Putin decides.”  

Publicly we know the Russians support the war. Privately we don't truly know. As someone once told Julia, if a man knocks on your door and asks if you support Putin you say yes.  

Estimates currently put the support for the war at 70%. It helps that the media is pumping them full of propaganda and that the people are not actually inside the war zone itself. It's like an abstract far away thing to them so they feel safe and secure.

And since Putin wants some sort of headway in this region, he probably gave orders to take the area and beyond ""by any means necessary"" and his generals have no choice but to keep pulling resources there. Meanwhile the other fronts of this new Russian ""offensive"" crumble and barely make any other headway elsewhere.

Throw in some stories of Wagner and mercenaries being almost destroyed, Russian soldiers now being siphoned there instead, and the increasing bombardments made by Ukraine recently make me think things are going according to some sort of plan.

[...]

>The irony of this situation is not lost on Germany.

>For weeks, Chancellor Olaf Scholz resisted an intense public pressure campaign from Ukraine’s leaders, European politicians and security experts to supply Kyiv with tanks, and to permit other nations to send some of their own Leopards, despite German concerns that it could be perceived by Russia as a NATO escalation. Many goaded Mr. Scholz with a social media campaign: #Freetheleopards.

>Germany has offered 18, and Poland another 14, but the numbers drop from there. And once the currently pledged tanks go into battle and get hit or break down, it is not clear which Leopards — or which country — will replace them.

Baker’s statement was made in that context… Everything that could have been and needed to be done to solidify that political obligation was done.

The massive strategic crippling that the Russian army faces is that they are not planning attacks on the wisest course of action, instead, they plan unrealistic attacks to appease the ego of madman who doesn't know anything about how to wage a war. And if the Russian general says 'that's not a good approach' they are replaced by a yes man with even fewer skills. 

The Ukraine strategy is simple:  be the rocky shoals that the Russian waves break themselves against.  The Russians are losing equipment and experienced pro soldiers that they can not replace. The Ukrainians have arsenal America behind them, and almost all men of the entire country will fight to their deaths to protect the homeland from the raping, theft and destruction of the Russian invasion. 

So: currently, strategically Ukraine is winning in Bakhmut.  Even if they lost the battle tomorrow, it was not worth the soldiers and equipment already lost by Russia to take it. 

When the Bradleys and Leopards are near the front, the switch will be thrown, and Ukrainians are going to absolutely crush the weak points of the Russian lines.  

Russia has little chance of being successful in the invasion, and because of them being led by a near senile old spy master thief, who doesn't know anything about war, and only gets propaganda for his reports, and empty promises by fearful generals, this will not end well for the Russian invasion.

Ukraine will excise the cancer and the mercenaries, purge all the invaders.

The Russians are committing forces and supplies on a narrow front, drawing off both from other parts of the theater - given the location and proximity to Russian-friendly areas and the available transportation hubs, the Russians probably see this  area as their best chance for operational success.  This is stripping not only manpower, but more critically, ammunition and equipment from other areas.

Being fairly certain that they can continue to blunt and erode the Russian forces, if not completely hold Bakhmut proper, it gives Ukrainian forces time to regenerate with freshly Western-trained troops while getting new equipment (and more importantly, the supporting maintenance and logistical components) in place, just in time for optimal conditions when springtime hits.    It's a game the Ukrainian defenders will suffer a bloody price for in a game of operational rope-a-dope.

Problem is it's easily something to worry about because we really don't have a view into the balance of casualties.  

If the Ukrainians are able to extract this cost with a relatively small force that they don't need to reinforce, just rotate, then this is going swimingly for them.

The leader of Ukraine's military has said their goal is to cause the largest loss of life for Russia possible.

Remember at the beginning of 2022 when we kept getting reports about the troops that was stationed near Ukraine's borders was moving into Ukraine? We keep getting reports of percentages of those that had moved into the war. After that Ukraine fought a defensive war until Russia's troops was so low that Ukraine went on the offensive and took back Kharkiv Oblast. They pushed to nearly Svatove and Kreminna. That was when Russia was doing their mobilization because they was so low on troops. It took a while to get them into the field and Russia wasn't able to hold Kherson. Now that Russia got their mobilized troops into the war Ukraine is back on the defensive. Russia is losing a large number of troops so Ukraine is back to causing the most loss of life possible.

However, if we took 60k dead, that would mean 200-250k total casualties (dead+wounded+captured) based on traditional ratio of dead and wounded, which is number that is in line with American, British, Norwegian and Estonian intelligence estimates. 

Based on that, I am inclined to believe Western intelligence and to say that numbers Ukraine reports daily are bit inflated. 130k dead as claimed would mean about 500k total Russian casualties (dead+wounded+captured), which I don't think we are at yet.

Older people tend to remember the Cold War and thus are wary of trusting outside sources of information. The Kremlin uses that to their advantage with the [Russian foreign agent law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_foreign_agent_law) which they use to silence critics.  

From that Wikipedia article:  
>Once registered, they are subject to additional audits and are obliged to mark all their publications with a 24-word disclaimer saying that they are being distributed by a ""foreign agent"".[2] The phrase ""foreign agent"" (Russian: иностранный агент) in Russian has strong associations with Cold War-era espionage. The law has been heavily criticized both in Russia and internationally as violating human rights, and as a tool used to suppress civil society and press freedom within Russia, particularly groups opposed to Vladimir Putin.  

I do find it interesting that the people considered to be elites seem to be very deep in the propaganda too. Many people think that with their wealth and power that they would think differently or want to effect a regime change. That does not appear to be true.  

The fact that Putin may also believe the propaganda could be a blessing and a curse. It could explain some of the utterly disastrous decisions and expectations he has. Lets face it, I doubt anyone dare tell Putin the dictator the truth if it is not something he would wish to hear.

Russia would get to keep basically whatever land it wants, particularly the areas of special interest to Russia.  
Russia would demand a regime change in Ukraine to one which is pro-Russia and pro-Putin. The Ukrainians must be content to be with Russia.  
America and NATO must keep out of Ukraine and out of such a ""peace"" process.  

Knowing what Russia is demanding in a ""peace"" deal certainly puts into perspective what the Ukrainians are fighting for.  

I find it frustrating to think about how some western countries let Putin get away with so much for so long. Annexing land, murdering people in other countries with chemical weapons and radioactive materials, destabilising our societies, being heavily involved with organised crime.  

If the rest of the world had stood up to him sooner I wonder if much what he's done over the decades may not have happened.  

But no, world leaders didn't take Russia seriously. They also legitimised him on the world stage which boosted his popularity with the Russian public. People lined up to work with Putin and corrupt Russian companies.  

I recall reading in a news article about a person trying to bring attention to Russian activities in the UK some time ago and nobody wanted to know at the time. It was basically a case of don't rock the boat.  

It's also frustrating that so many people still see the west as always evil and Russia and the Soviet Union as always good.

In a documentary she described how she used to think and act. She did so with zeal and pride knowing that she was doing everything for the leader. The people have indoctrination from a very young age. They also have mandatory group sessions where they have to rip each other apart and confess and rat out each other for wrong thoughts and actions.  

The old woman said that looking back she was so very deeply ashamed of how she thought and acted. At the time she didn't know any better. It was what they were trained from as early as possible to do. Their whole life was like that.

Putin sees democracy as a tool used by America and the CIA to topple dictators such as himself. We know he was obsessed with how Saddam and Gaddafi died. This is why he freaked out back in 2014 when the Ukrainian people protested. He saw democracy coming to another Soviet country. That was too close to the Kremlin for him. What cemented that idea in his mind was Clinton publicly voicing support for the protesters. Putin ordered snipers to shoot the protesters.  

In Putin's paranoid mind, this war is between Russia and America. We know he doesn't even think Ukraine is a real country. We know that he believes Ukraine would have fallen by now if it were not for America. He sees it as a puppet of America. Putin wants to put his own puppet in Ukraine.  

When the 2014 protests happened in Ukraine Putin thought that it was getting too close to the Kremlin. Worse still, if the Russian people saw democracy working in Ukraine then the Russian people may start calling for it.  

Putin has gone to great lengths to stop the Russian people from having democracy. He works towards destabilising our societies so he can point at them and say our democracies are just as corrupt as Russia is. Plus Putin has given the Russians [Sovereign democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_democracy). It's not real democracy as we know it.

They were not caught off guard at Kherson -- they stationed enough people there to hold the ground indefinitely, and they successfully held on without giving up almost any ground throughout three months of concerted pushes by Ukraine from September through November.

Ultimately, Russia could not transport enough munitions across two frail, always-under-fire bridges to keep those defenses resupplied forever, so they had to withdraw without suffering any threatening breakthroughs from Ukraine. Ukraine lost hundreds of vehicles in the Kherson fighting and thousands of lives, primarily to Russian artillery, despite a large advantage in manpower and vehicles on that front. Western tanks would not have produced a better result for Ukraine, because Western tanks would not have done anything to address the problem, which was Russian artillery.

It's going to be even tougher for Ukraine's offensives in 2023. Neither a lack of manpower nor a lack of supply will be problems for Russia in the Zaporozhe-Vulhedar front. Better thermals, guns and fire control systems don't even make the top 20 things that would help Ukraine break through this area. The most important need for Ukraine, far above everything else, is a lot more artillery, and a lot more ammunition for their artillery. The second most important thing they need is a lot more mobile artillery. Without air power, the one and only thing that can produce a result for Ukraine against well fortified positions is an overwhelming superiority in artillery-delivered explosives. It is questionable that they have this advantage at any point in 2023, but we shall see.

The Western tanks are needed primarily for padding in the numbers of tanks and vehicles they can field. They go fast, which is nice, but speed won't save them from losing hundreds of these vehicles to Russian artillery. The fact that these Western tanks have good armor and mobility will only be helpful *after* they break through the Russian defenses, which could still take month and tens of thousands of casualties.

There was a large reorganization in the Ukranian army in 2016 and there have been extensive NATO training missions in Ukraine since 2014. I'd have to check but as I recall over 120,000 soldiers received training and a large part of it was to encourage a professional class of NCO's in the Ukranian army and adopt other aspects of NATO style armies like officers being given more leeway to adapt to the reality on the ground when trying to carry out their orders.

Obviously they are not to NATO standard but there has been progress made, that progress is a huge reason why the Ukrainian army has performed as well as it has, on average they are better trained than the Russian soldiers they are fighting.

The reason people are taking issue with the article is because the person doesn't seem to know even the very basics of all the NATO training missions over the last 8 years. The Ukranian army isn't ""finally warming"" to the idea of military training reform, they've been doing it for the last 8 years. That anonymous Finnish officer doesn't know what they are talking about and the person writing the article could have debunked what they are saying with some very basic research but for some reason didn't.

You said ""people are pointing out that Europe doesn't have enough tanks to give"".  In responding ""how many are enough?"", I was asking *how many does Europe need to retain in order to have enough for their defence?*  Not how many Ukraine are asking for!

I continued ""And to defend against what threats?  Russian aggression?"".   By which I meant, *for what purpose does Europe have all these tanks except to defend against Russian aggression* (ergo sending them to Ukraine is very much fulfilling the very purpose for which Europe have the things in the first place).

You then point again to the article's mention that only a small number are being sent, by way of answer to my belief that Europe can spare more than a few dozen of their thousands.  But that doesn't logically follow: just because Europe are indeed only sending a small number (for now) does not mean that they cannot spare more.
