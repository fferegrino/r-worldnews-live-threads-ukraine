Day 23 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today shelling continued but there was much less of it, instead we hear our artillery almost non-stop, which while not as scary as explosions it still chills you to the bone. 

And while all of this is happening the life in the city seemingly continues as normal, there are explosions nearby, even gun fights, but people are standing in queues without even really flinching, at this point for people here this is just a regular Friday, nothing more.

Interestingly enough my university is going to reopen on 21st already, in distance learning mode, but this is nothing new, we were learning from home since Covid started. But it sure will be quite weird continuing our studies while there are explosions happening just outside the window.

Also about me previously saying that our words might be getting through to our relatives – we were completely wrong, it is a lost cause, they don’t believe us at all, instead they are saying to us what is ""actually"" happening here, and of course they know the situation here better than us, people literally living here and seeing everything unfold with our own eyes.

At the same time the stuff they are worried about is absolutely irrelevant, almost everyone everywhere in Russian internet is saying “why are you swearing?” why? How about you live under constant fear of death and try not to raise your voice or swear, why is this even a question? 

Also what they care about is that our side in negotiations with Russia isn’t dressed sharp, what the fuck? People’s lives are at stake and they are saying that our team of negotiators insults theirs by not dressing for the occasion while praising their own negotiators. It is like we are living on different planets, they care about such minor things while completely disregarding the things that actually matter.

> Pope Francis condemned Russia’s “perverse abuse of power” against the Ukrainian people during a gathering in Slovakia Friday, The Associated Press reports.
> 
> Francis, speaking to European Catholic representatives, said that Ukrainians have been attacked in their “identity, history and tradition” and are “defending their land.”
> 
> “The heartbreaking scream for help from our Ukrainian brothers pushes us as a community of believers not just to serious reflection, but to cry with them and work for them; to share the anguish of a people wounded in its identity, history and tradition,” Francis said.
> 
> He continued: “The blood and tears of the children, the suffering of women and men who are defending their land or fleeing from the bombs shake our conscience. Once again humanity is threatened by a perverse abuse of power and partisan interests, which condemns defenseless people to suffer all forms of brutal violence.”
> 
> “In the name of God, I ask: Stop this massacre,” Francis said to worshippers gathered in the Vatican.

I spoke to dozens of those queueing to enter the venue for the pro-Kremlin rally.

Many told the BBC they worked in the public sector, and that they had been pressured into attending by their employers.

One man who works in the Moscow metro told us that he and other employees had been forced to attend the rally.

""I'll be here for a while and then I'll leave… I think most people here don't support the war. I don't,"" he said.

Many people didn't want to be filmed or answer questions.

Students told us they had been given the option of a day off from lectures if they attended ""a concert"".

Some of the students we spoke to didn't even know that the event was dedicated, in part, to support the war in Ukraine.

There were doubtless some people in attendance who genuinely support President Putin and the ""special military operation in Ukraine"", as the Kremlin prefers to call it.

> 
> The Russian army never had enough trucks to sustain a fast-moving invasion force in Ukraine.
> 
> The problem has gotten a whole worse. As the wider war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, the Ukrainian army and sister services have destroyed no fewer than 485 Russian trucks.
> 
> That’s more than a tenth of the trucks that belong to the Russian army’s 10 “material-technical support” brigades, which haul supplies, ammo and fresh troops from rail-heads to front-line formations.
> 
> A shortage of trucks, growing ever more severe as the Ukrainians knock out more and more of the vehicles, was evident in the first 10 days of the invasion as Russia began transporting civilian vehicles into the war zone, probably in an effort to make up for losses of military trucks.
> 
> Now those civilian trucks are beginning to appear near the front lines, where they are big, slow targets for Ukrainian troops—and potential liabilities for battalions’ motor pools.
> 
> Consider that, since the war widened on the night of Feb. 23, the Ukrainians claim they’ve destroyed nearly 700 Russian trucks. Independent observers have confirmed 485 of those claims. The actual total of wrecked trucks likely lies between those two figures.

After the hope of victory was quelled, he continued the war to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a ""humiliating peace"". Russia ignored Japan's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea of bringing the dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague. The war eventually concluded with the Treaty of Portsmouth (5 September \[O.S. 23 August\] 1905), mediated by US President Theodore Roosevelt. The complete victory of the Japanese military surprised international observers and transformed the balance of power in both East Asia and Eastern Europe, resulting in Japan's emergence as a great power and Russia's decline in prestige and influence in Eastern Europe. The loss of life without victory and the humiliating defeat for the Russian Empire contributed to growing domestic unrest which culminated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and accelerated the disintegration of the Russian autocracy.

China has always advocated peace and opposed war, which is a Chinese historical and cultural tradition. We have always proceeded from the right and wrong of the matter itself, made independent judgments, advocated the maintenance of international law and the universally recognized basic norms of international relations, adhered to the UN Charter, and advocated a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. These broad principles are the foothold for China to handle the Ukrainian crisis. China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and is willing to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. All parties should jointly support Russia-Ukraine dialogue and negotiation, and negotiate results and peace. The United States and NATO should also conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.
> 
> The top priority now is to continue dialogue and negotiation, avoid civilian casualties, prevent humanitarian crises, and stop the fighting at an early date. The long-term solution lies in mutual respect among major powers, abandoning the Cold War mentality, not engaging in camp confrontation, and gradually building a balanced, effective and sustainable global and regional security architecture. China has been doing its best for peace and will continue to play a constructive role.

> Casualties are a factor. The 150k figure includes air defense and support troops. The share of combat troops is smaller and they're taking the losses. Russia deployed 120 BTGs with ~800 soldiers each=~95,000 troops. Plus ~15-25k separatist forces and National Guard troops.

> Russia may have 90% of its combat power still available, but the casualties have disproportionally affected its elite units, like the VDV, razvedchiki, and spetsnaz, and maneuver units. Those are the units needs to occupy territory and seize Kyiv.

I tried to do a possible allies/axis list, but much of it depends on how China would side in the event of WWIII. And it made my brain hurt. And there’s so many countries I know literally nothing about. So I instead included some notable relationships, positive and negative.

Germany in the 1930s is not Russia now.  Germany was able to focus their energy and resources on building a highly effective war machine, they had millions of voluntary soldiers, and everyone was truly committed to the ""cause.""  It was a total cultural commitment by EVERYONE to push for this.

That's not Russia.  Russia's never going to commit like Germany did to building a war machine because a) they have nukes and think that's enough and b) they can't stop themselves from hoarding money and selling shit off to make more money.  They're addicted to the grift.  And if Russians were truly gung-ho people, they wouldn't need all these conscripts.  And, NATO is much more united, and Germany never had to face that.  If Russia didn't actually fear NATO, he wouldn't push for Ukraine to declare they'll never join.

Russia's military, aside from nukes, poses no true threat in a substantial way to ""the West"", NATO, or China.  And their kleptocratic culture is what's preventing this change.  Could it change?  Perhaps - I know the whole ""this is just like when Germany's economy imploded"" but we're living in a vastly different world.  Germany wasn't tied to the global economy like Russia is or was.  China is tied to the global economy.  Disrupting it in a massive way threatens not just you and me, but guys like Xi whose whole existence thrives on maintaining order.  

And, all of this bluster about ""Poland's next!"" is absurd - it doesn't mean Russia wouldn't try, I mean Poland probably by itself would hand them a pretty sound defeat.

Counter-attacks were also reported to have cut off Russian military formations near the southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol, though the latter is getting weaker, he added.

“In the terrain between the cities you have a lot of tank attacks, fighting and a lot of counter-attacks,” he said. “The anti-tank weapons have been very effective, you can slow down (Russian) tanks to get them close enough to be attacked by infantry.”

Mr Gressel said the sustainability of Ukraine’s defences rested on a mechanised infantry that is equipped with tanks, vehicles and artillery.

“The West has not yet grasped this for the resupply and support issue, because the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition for artillery, they are short on ammunition for tanks (and) they have heavy losses on tanks,” he said.“

> 
> Amanda Macias Jul 1, 2015, 7:23 AM
> 
> August Landmesser, the lone German refusing to raise a stiff right arm amid Hitler's presence at a 1936 rally, had been a loyal Nazi.
> 
> On June 13, 1936, Landmesser gave a crossed-arm stance during Hitler's christening of a new German navy vessel.
> 
> The act of defiance stands out amid the throng of Nazi salutes.
> 
> In 1937, fed up, Landmesser attempted to flee Nazi Germany to Denmark with his family. But he was detained at the border and charged with ""dishonoring the race,"" or ""racial infamy,"" under the Nuremberg Laws. 
> 
> Refusing to abandon his wife, Landmesser ignored Nazi wishes and was arrested again in 1938 and sentenced to nearly three years in a concentration camp.
> 
> He would never see the woman he loved or his child again.
> 
> Eckler is believed to have been transferred to what the Nazi's called a ""euthanasia center"" in 1942, where she was murdered with 14,000 others.

which is to say, i see a lot of parallels between the russian invasion of ukraine and the american invasion of iraq. and one of the key details of the iraq war was that many of us, including teenage me, didn't realize the absolute horror we were to unleash on not only iraq, but the entire region and the world as a result of our reckless actions. having grown up during the post-9/11 era, i understand why the average russian supports the war and embraces the jingoistic bullshit. i just hope to god they realize sooner than we did what war really means and what their country is really doing. just so much destruction, death, generations of ill-will and conflict, for incredibly nebulous political goals.

edit: to be clear, i'm not drawing an equivalency between the ukrainian government and iraq. i am talking about how the war was justified to the people. the russian government has gotten the consent of its people by claiming the nazi ukrainian government is ruthlessly murdering/oppressing the russian-speaking minority, which justifies their intervention on moral grounds. and that is just very reminiscent to me of the justifications used for the iraq war, and of course the war ended up being far, far worse than the disease even if you took the government at its word.",1647638467.0,1647638038.0,t3_th3ycn,t3_th3ycn,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Most say the sanctions are not really felt much besides a bit higher prices in stores. Some didn't even notice this. Then IT stuff has become pricy for men and some makeup brands for women. And some stores and payment systems are gone. They seem to be very anti-war or neutral compared to the average Russian. Largely because it's Moscow, they are young, and the channel and interviewer are not nationalistic so they don't try to find fascists to interview.

I've watched a lot of interviews and basically from day one not many have noticed much about the sanctions. The effect is not really felt yet. You likely need to get through a few months of rent and buying goods before the price increase is felt as a single day of shopping doesn't mean much. Many Russians think this will end when Ukraine agrees to some new terms and the war ends. Or Russia will move on in some other way. Most are very optimistic unless they are very anti-war. Then it's all a disaster as all Putin does is a disaster.

If Russians were right it'd be fine but what they didn't realize is if the convoy was stopped too far from the border thered be no hope of resupply even if they fought off ukranian resistence, so whatever fuel it had for the journey needed to get them there. So the ukranians stopped them 12 miles from kyiv and essentially trapped them into clogging the entire route. If ukranians immediately destroyed it, the russian high command wouldve sent in a more beefed up convoy in the first week, plus more secure convoys down other roads instead of all down one route, thered be less clogging on the main route and more vigilence by russian forces towards a more threatening enemy. But Russia thought 12 miles was easy so they wasted days trying to get that convoy going again, but 12 miles might as well have been 1200, that convoy was simply too far and too long to help. It also played into Russian hubris, because they figured making it all but 12 miles to Kyiv really did mean little ukranian resistance, and thus the urgency to get more supplies going wasn't as great. They really found out how screwed they were about 4-5 days in when tbey gave russian soldiers an order to scavenge for food. Now that convoy is dead and they just got other convoys going down which is why you see Russians slowly moving south on the kyiv west Bank. But these are very slow resupplies because these roads aren't as direct to kyiv or as massive, so fuel for tanks and therefore offensive tank operations have ceased in favor of getting munitions and food to the infantry.

Let's talk a bit about nuclear war. 

As the invasion falters, Putin will be making more and more nuclear threats - the only thing he has left. These will most likely be just that: threats. I doubt him, or the Russian elite is suicidal.

If it came to nuclear war, Russia would essentially be deleted from the face of the planet, while the West would generally survive in some form or another.

A nuclear war right now would not be the end of humanity. Sure, it would suck, and by that I mean a LOT of people dying, at least a billion plus. However, it wouldn't erase life from the planet.

Consider how most of our media (movies, games, etc) dealing with nuclear war takes place during the cold war, or its fictional continuation. At that point we did have enough nukes to format the planet. However, since then we have decommissioned 80% of our total nuclear arsenal, meaning a nuclear war would be fought with only a fifth of the firepower.

Also, not all our (as in: humanity's) nukes are ICBMs. Many of them can' t even be deployed unless you haul it above a city with a plane. Many are ""just"" warheads sitting in warehouses, and couldn't immediately be launched. This is especially true to Russia, as they would be deleted long before any of those warheads could be used.

Another thing to consider is how those strikes would be distributed. Russia has to blanket the whole of Europe and US, possibly more, while the West only has to strike Russian strategic targets. This is a guaranteed death sentence for the Russian elite, including Putin. Hence I don't think he'll press the button, or even if he tried, he'd end up with a hole in his head.

Otherwise radiation from nuclear bombs dissipates very quickly. You know how in Fallout games everything is still radioactive after 200 years? As far as I know that's bullshit.
48 hours after the strike, the radiation will have already gone down by 99%, and at 72 hours it should be safe to come out. The tricky part is to not be in the blast radius, or at least be in a basement when a strike happens near you. That, or a sturdy enough building, in which case you should stay in the middle, on the lowest floor. Don't go to upper floors, as fallout will accumulate on the roof.
Food and drink in closed containers that were inside during the strike should be generally safe to consume, so chances are you won't die of hunger or dehydration.

To sum up, Putin will threaten with nukes, but it's unlikely he will actually use them. Even if he does though, the world won't end, plus your chances of survival aren't bad if the bomb wasn't dropped directly on you, and you can stick it out in a basement for 3 days",False,1647629177.0,t3_th3ycn,t3_th3ycn,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

I think it’s fair to say it is a complex situation but also pretty clear Russia is on the wrong side of this thing.

You can look at NATO missions like Afghanistan and Yugoslavia and argue that NATO has done bad stuff too but those are more nuanced and even if you believe they should not have sent their military (I believe that both were likely mistakes, certainly Afghanistan) at least they weren’t as destructive. 

I will say the current Yemen situation is a bit of a NATO failing that may result in more death then the Ukraine war.

Russia keeps its borders safe through force. The US does it though convenient terms for us Mexicans. But it's ridiculous and incredibly naive to think the US would allow Russian or Chinese bases in our territory. 

The US would not invade because it doesn't have to. It can cripple our economy overnight, same as it did for Russia. 




""The expropriation act had international repercussions. The foreign-owned oil companies retaliated by instituting an embargo against Mexican oil. Mexican oil exports decreased by 50% and the Mexican Government’s primary customer for oil became Nazi Germany. Expropriation also led the British to take a very strong stand against Mexico's actions, which prompted the Cárdenas government to sever diplomatic relations.

Although Hull’s attempts to directly challenge the Mexican Government fell out of favor, U.S. companies fought the expropriation in their own way. For over two years following expropriation, the oil companies made extravagant demands for compensation, which the Mexicans repeatedly rejected. The U.S. Government supported the oil companies until the Second World War began in Europe, at which point it pressured them to accept a settlement. Finally, on April 18, 1942, the U.S. and Mexican Governments signed the Cooke-Zevada agreement, whereby the Mexicans agreed to pay roughly $29 million in compensation to several American firms, including Jersey Standard and Socal. The British, however, held out until 1947, when they received $130 million.""

Definitely nothing like I see in the media (media being anything that's not Russian state media, of course).

I think some prices have definitely risen, but some items were discounted as well, so it's safe to say the whole picture is really complex, as it all depends on the region in question, the store chain, maybe the particular store to some degree.

I'd say the empty shelves do happen right now judging by the evidence, but it's most likely due to people panic buying some stuff rather than the entire country having a prominent deficit. Unless Putin is out and/or off for good, the real deficit will probably come, but I wouldn't expect it to come this soon in a country with over 140m people and so big in size - the warehouses may be filled with imported goods, but they have some stuff there for now for sure.",False,1647653217.0,t3_th3ycn,t1_i184hrr,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

One of the largest global industries is marketing. Marketing is friendly word we use for ""coercion"". Marketing is just trying to convince ""free thinkers"" of something they don't realize. This is what Russia is doing. Any country can do this to some extent, in the west it's just mostly private countries and somewhat harmless out of wartime.

Russia has taken every bit of marketing in peoples lives from internet search rankings, social media's recommended posts, posts from influencers you follow, posts from innocuous pages (cute cat memes), Television ads, Radio ads, placements in shows, in newspapers, park benches, schools, books, music, every single aspect of pop culture and replaced it with subtle or not so subtle pro russia propaganda. 

How can you even doubt it? You can't search for it, you don't hear about it, everything you ever see or can access in your life (especially if you only speak russian), is entirely in support of it. It's unanimous. The celebrities you like, the podcasts, your friends, everything.

I am certain that if you actually asked average russians how many ""regular people like them"" in the west (not government) support russia's cause, they would say over half. And they would believe it. Because those people in the west are just like them. They hate their governments, and even tried to overthrow it (jan 6th). They are controlled by Nazi's too! Listen to the corruption of hunter biden, look how many are talking about it! See? the normal people of the West could never be in favour of these Nazi's.


This same thing happened with Germany. Their news ONLY covered the enemy. Sometimes it lied, but often it didn't even need to. It worked fine just to pick and choose what is talked about. Same today. ""Oh our brave heroes"" ""Look at the StopRussiaPhobia that's trending"" ""Look at this massive protest in the west in support"" 

But they don't show the rest. The indiscriminate carpet bombing. The hospitals burning. The children crying. Which is why when some real information sneaks through, it's easy for them to say : ""Well, it's war. Of course you can find some examples if you look hard enough"", and that's only if they don't believe it was ukrainian Nazi's bombing their own cities in the first place. 

That's why it shouldn't be surprising 70% support it. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it goes higher. 

It will only change when it hits so close to home that they can see the lies in real time. And that will be when soldiers come home. The ones who have went and returned, they will probably be the most disillusioned. It's probably better for Russia if they return dead, because the dead can't speak. The ones who can, they are a threat.

It doesn't specify how the aid should be delivered. But it does allow member states to operate within their own security and defense policy. So states that have a policy to remain outside of foreign military conflicts can do so and send other forms of aid instead.

kind of, but not exactly. 

here's my theory - there's the low key racism and NIMBY aspects of it of course, but IMO there's another things here. 

not existing UKR presence in online communities, but the way they (and the government) took to the internet following the invasion. I remain certain Zelenskyy will become not only a political case study, but also PR and marketing one for years to come. Plus regular people have been using twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and TikTok very effectively with video and photographs, and the diaspora was mobilized quickly and effectively. 

My opinion? Less existing online presence, more ability to speak English + internet penetration in the country. they had the infra that allowed regular people to communicate over all social media channels + did it in English, which made them immediately relatable to English speaking countries worldwide.

also their diaspora included major names - see: hockey, the first person to advocate for barring Russia and Belarus from international competition (and it took the IIHF a week even after this) was Wayne Gretzky, the best to play the game ever. until that happened, a lot of commentators were saying ""but sports and politics shouldn't mix."" he said something, everyone changed track ASAP.",False,1647630678.0,t3_th3ycn,t1_i16rwut,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

I think there's more than one aspect. The past decade has seen a lot of overt calling out of politicians and campaigns funded by the Russians. For the most part there is at minimum acceptance that Russia attempted to influence Brexit and Trump. So the west is very much quick to accuse politicians of being Russian assets right now. Remember that Germany tried to massively downplay all this and their people criticised their government massively. With the exception of Biden, who probably sees advantage in exposing Russia right now, the leaders of the west wanted to downplay. It is the public who've told politicians that it is enough.

Reality is the game is over for Russian influence in western politics. All the existing politicians on their payroll are being forced to prove they aren't on their payroll. We've seen disbandment of the ""X Friends of Russia"" subgroups in British political parties.

Processes like this reach a tipping point eventually. Foreign funding of politicians was always going to be something that eventually became a crisis. Once it did there'd be a crack down.

Honestly we may not ever see a 6th or 7th gen fighter, as drone swarms and smart weapons have proven they are easy. 

War used to be fought by numbers. How many shells you could launch. How far you can launch them. How many Bombers you have. You may kill 1 enemy combatant or vehicle per 100 shells launched, and level the city. This is what russia has fallen back on now that they are running short on smart weapons.

The future will likely be drones. Unmanned, smaller, quieter, and more precise. the 1% shooting percentage of shell will be upped to 90% with things like the switchblade where nearly every shot has a high likelyhood of hitting. In time, anti drone weapons will close the gap and start lower the percentage.

But new autonomous weapons will fill the gap. I've always though iron mans shoulder launched micro guided projectiles are probably  possible.

 But where are the big ""strike packages"" of planes bating and hunting Ukrainian AA missiles ?  No one know at this point. Some experts say the lack of experience, both organising big numbers of planes in the sky at once, and individual pilot skill are a issue. Both sides operate the same types of fighters AND the same type of Anti-Air systems. So its a friendly fire nightmare for the larger force in the best of times. Just plain maintenance/ readiness % of the air force might be an issue based on the state of the army we have seen show up so far.

  Ukrainian Air Defence has quite a large number of Russian anti air missiles and are using them well. A skilled crew of a AA system in general can be very hard to hunt down if they use proper tactics.

 A crew of four was out on training assignments.  They should have landed just before 6 p.m.

 Helicopters and planes were sent out to search for the plane.  At 21.17, a discovery was made on the ground in an area called Gråtådalen in Beiarn, says HRS to NRK.

 There are crews on their way into the area.

Only you didnt stay to look, what with a war going on, and 5 of them turned out to be only wounded. That troop leaves behind their dead(they're still being shot at), and the next day they meet another group of fighters, who kill another 10 men. This includes the 5 wounded, who now got counted twice.

The remaining 5 men run into the woods, where they starve to death without being found.

Meanwhile, the next day, a civilian finds the original 5 bodies, shares a video of them on tiktok, and reports them as well.

now, as an independent observer, you have:  
10 dead reported from the 1st commander  
10 dead reported from the 2nd commander  
5 dead from civilian report  
5 dead from tiktok video evidence  

meanwhile there's 5 others that died that will not show up in statistics until their bodies get found somewhere next spring.

Mariupol is hell on Earth. No ressources get into the city, constant bombardement, probably 2500+ civilian deaths, children hospital and maternity hospital bombed. city still not taken, heavy fights. 

Western Ukraine got targeted by airstrikes new. One hit got as close as about 25km from Poland. 

Russian attack seems to be the heaviest in the East, Odessa is preparing for an attack, which would probably follow the fall the Mariupol, if it happens.

First, the US built an international consensus before the invasion.  Granted, this consensus was based in large part on false claims regarding chemical and biological weapons.  However, the US made its case before the UN and with allies.  It sought approval before going in.

Second, the US did not act unilaterally.  Again, the coalition was based on bullshit, but it was a coalition.

Third, the US had not acted to annex portions of the country in the past.  This is huge.  This is why Russia's actions seem so venal and are meeting with such condemnation.  It's--probably rightfully--perceived that Russia stated a war of territorial expansion/annexation.  This hasn't happened in Europe in decades.  The reprobation that Russia are receiving is as much due to the threatening precedent that this sets for other European nations as any altruistic desire to maintain Ukrainian independence.

Fourth, there was a basic international consensus that Saddam was a threat to his own people, was a tyrant and needed to go...so while there were real and justified concerns with the US going to war based on false pretenses...almost no one was upset at the result.  Whereas, almost no one but Russia had desire for regime change in Ukraine...and in fact Ukraine was seen as a success story of a country throwing off the yoke of an astroturfed Russian puppet in Yanukovich.

Famine and plague will rival and probably eclipse the number of deaths compared to the blasts of Nuclear weapons themselves. Loss of crop production, food supply chain failures, infrastructure outages, and water source contaminations will all play a role, depending on where detonations occur and the tonnage.

If we just look at Wheat Exports/Imports since it's the most commonly discussed and would be one of the most impacted crop;

Russia exports 17.6% of the global Wheat supply (#1 Exporter)

US exports 14.1% of the global Wheat supply (#2 Exporter)

Ukraine exports 8% of the global Wheat supply (#5 Exporter)

Combined that is 39.7% of the world's available Wheat imports potentially unavailable.

If we look at that value in equivalent Importers, we have;

Egypt: 5.6%

Indonesia: 5.4%

Turkey: 4.8%

China: 4.7% (China produces the most wheat globally, but doesn't export much)

Nigeria: 4.2%

Italy: 4.2%

Algeria: 3.4%

Philippines: 3.2%

Japan: 3.1%

Netherlands: 2%

Corn would look similar, except the US exports 26% of the global supply, Ukraine exports 13.2%, Russia 1.1%

US exports 40% of the global Soy Bean market. (Brazil exports 44.3%)

Russia and US export 17% of the global Sunflower supply (Romania exports 14.8%)

It is [also thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Nuclear_summer) that everything dying and burning/decomposing will also greatly raise CO2/methane levels, causing a nuclear summer after the soot clears.

Finally, there is the chance that nukes deplete the ozone layer. Wiki says ""around the Earth"", but I can't quantify or qualify what that range is or why it would be entirely around the Earth and not localized to one hemisphere for a nuclear exchange.

\- The figure of 100 nukes exploding on Earth would end humanity is if every one of them were as big as Tsar Bomba, which is several thousand times larger than what is in everyone's arsenal right now (that we know of).

So the idea of the environment being completely destroyed isn't exactly what would happen. But yes, lots would die. Especially if nobody refuses to surrender after the first few exchanges.

Interesting enough, between 1972-2002 the USA was a signatory to [the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/abmtreaty) which barred both the US and the USSR / later Russia from deploying nationwide defenses against strategic ballistic missiles. The working idea was that allowing the US and USSR to further develop ballistic missile defenses would lead to both countries developing ever-more effective iterations of ballistic missiles, when the existing ICBMs were already more than enough to destroy the world many times over. There was also the concern that if one of the two nations unveiled a fully functioning ICBM defense net unexpectedly they would effectively break MAD. The goal was to slow down the nuclear proliferation arms race and keep MAD intact. 

The US withdrew from that treaty in 2002, ostensibly because of the threat from Iran.

In addition, a counter-referendum on accession to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast was held in some Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

the east has another concern, which is the russian capture of izyum. if that advance is not checked, the russians could potentially march on the rear of ukrainian forces near the line of contact. 

the situation near kherson is currently unknown, ua forces have gotten very close to the city there but it is not clear if they intend to or are capable of re-taking it. kherson is a major objective and ukraine re-capturing it would be a huge problem for the forces coming in from crimea, who would no doubt be forced to retreat from the front and defend their rear.

the situation in kyiv appears to be stable. the city is not surrounded and it's not clear if the russians have the ability to do so. they are attempting to bring their artillery closer to the city, and ua is trying to keep them farther away. russia does not seem to have the ability to seriously advance to the east as long as ua continues to hold chernihiv, and the west around irpin is a constant battleground with russians apparently attempting and (hopefully) failing to cross the irpin river into kyiv. this has bought kyiv a ton of time to reinforce & fortify, so it's not an ideal situation for russia.

so, tides turning for them? no. do they still have options and the ability to win the war? yes, the situation remains dangerous for ukraine.",1647633038.0,1647632645.0,t3_th3ycn,t1_i16y8bl,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russia's military buildup near Ukraine has expanded to include supplies of blood along with other medical materials that would allow it to treat casualties, in yet another key indicator of Moscow's military readiness, three U.S. officials tell Reuters.  
Current and former U.S. officials say concrete indicators -- like blood supplies -- are critical in determining whether Moscow would be prepared to carry out an invasion, if Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to do so.  
The disclosure of the blood supplies by U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, adds another piece of context to growing U.S. warnings that Russia could be preparing for a new invasion of Ukraine as it masses more than 100,000 troops near its borders.

Order of events, musks tweets

1 . I suspect that the Thai govt has this under control, but I’m happy to help if there is a way to do so

2 . SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.

3 . Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.

4 . Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand

5 . Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation.

6 . Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage pic.twitter.com/2z01Ut3vxJ

7 . Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful. pic.twitter.com/EHNh8ydaTT

(not musk)

SpaceX team met w/ Admiral Apakorn Youkongpaew and members of Thai Navy yesterday in CEI to train them on the mini-submarine. **Navy believes it could be helpful and practical in future rescue efforts and will conduct further testing in Bangkok in the near future.** (my emphasis)

(musk replies)

8 . Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.

//Water levels recede and a rescue without the sub is possible//

9 . Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!

//People start bashing musk and his backup plan, he responds

10 . The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: pic.twitter.com/dmC9l3jiZR


quote from that tweet of correspondence - ""It is absolutely worth continuing with the development of this system in as timely a manner as feasible.  If the rain holds out it may well be used""


11 . This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.

 Cave rescuer on Musk: “It was a PR stunt. It had no chance of working.”

So I don't know about ten years too early. In those ten years, the UA would be ten years more prepared too. It's actually quite a good strategic move on Putin's part to attack an 8 year-old country which hasn't resolved a lot of the issues (like corruption and poverty) from the Yanukovych era.

China has always advocated peace and opposed war, which is a Chinese historical and cultural tradition. We have always proceeded from the right and wrong of the matter itself, made independent judgments, advocated the maintenance of international law and the universally recognized basic norms of international relations, adhered to the UN Charter, and advocated a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept. These broad principles are the foothold for China to handle the Ukrainian crisis. China has put forward a six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and is willing to provide further humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and other affected countries. All parties should jointly support Russia-Ukraine dialogue and negotiation, and negotiate results and peace. The United States and NATO should also conduct dialogue with Russia to solve the crux of the Ukraine crisis and resolve the security concerns of both Russia and Ukraine.

This is from Xi Jinping's call with President Biden today, which further reiterates humanitarian aid and not military assistance

It's a slightly culturally different form of Russian people (to them) insisting it ought to have its own sovereign country and then stabbing Russia, their former countrymen, in the back because of foreign influence.

While the Chinese aren't really trying to exterminate the Uighurs, the re-education camps are troubling. (ie. ""you can't have your Uighur culture: let us show you how to be more Chinese"") - it's one step away from Russia's ""stop being Ukrainian, using the Ukrainian language, and worshipping in a separate Ukrainian church. Try to be more Russian, and let us help you with that; by exterminating you.""

I hope the Biden administration is aware of that and is treading carefully.

In a world where multiculturalism is frowned upon, countries like the US who are melting pots, are massively fucked. (just a pragmatic view: beyond the moral judgement of how terrible the idea of a world of ""ethnostates"" is).

And note: Communism/Socialism originated in Germany. In the early years, the Nazi party was a breakaway group from Socialism (they even called themselves ""socialist"").  They were all for Socialism: but ONLY for ""good Aryans"".  Not for people of other races/ethnicities, or who didn't ""fit in"".  Communism/Socialism (as a philosophy) should provide equal treatment, and accept everyone.  Early Soviet Russia and USSR embraced this ideal, but sometime after Stalin took power, they went more the direction of the German Nazis; and this is how we ended up with stuff like mass forced migrations/deportations, gulag, and the Ukrainian Holodomor.  

So yes, it does seem as if Putin specifically, and Duginist ""Foundations of Geopolitics"" thinking, has infected not only Xi, but a lot of CCP insiders, and they're leaning towards a Stalinist interpretation. 

Where the rubber hits the road for Xi having a ""white friend"": I think these ""Foundations of Geopolitics"" types are perfectly happy with other races and etc: as long as they stay in their own countries.  Tough luck for the Uighurs. And the Tibetans. (etc). If Russians and Chinese had to live together in a single country, with this attitude, theyd genocide each other until they were in separate countries.

So it's a bit of a marriage of convenience between them: ""Don't mess with our genocide of the Uighurs, and we'll not mess with your genocide of the Ukrainians""",False,1647622790.0,t3_th3ycn,t1_i166fx1,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Your point about Los Angeles is really very shaky considering that the US State of California is land annexed by the United States. If they had a majority Mexican American population who voted in a referendum to join as a state of Mexico I don't see why that shouldn't happen.

Your point about Vancouver is a far better one, but honestly even then such scenarios have happened. In 2013 there was [a referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum) in the Falkland Islands (located, if you weren't aware, 900 miles off the coast of Argentina, about 8000 miles from the UK) about whether they wished to remain a part of the UK or not. The vote was a comical 99.8% result to remain in the UK. Argentine detractors claimed that this was an unfair vote because the inhabitants are overwhelmingly British immigrants.

Donetsk and Lugansk, however border Russia. [Donetsk's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk#Demographics) is nearly half Russian (slightly more than it is Ukrainian) and the Russian language is overwhelmingly the majority-spoken language, with [similar demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk#Demographics) in Lugansk although there are slightly more ethnic Ukrainians there than Russians.

Given that a recognised national border has existed between Russia and Ukraine for only one generation, I just don't think that it's so crazy to give the people there the right to choose. This is a right which was not afforded them in 1991, and certainly not previously when decisions on what part of where counted for which SSR were probably fairly arbitrary. Perhaps these people feel Russian and do not wish to follow the path to closer ties with the EU that Ukraine is on, and would prefer to lean eastward. Especially since Ukraine has come to a time of decision in this crossroads in recent years I don't think that it is 'madness' to ask the ordinary citizens what they would prefer. 

Edit: Of course I'm no expert on any of this either. I'm just a regular reddit galaxy-brain wading in trying to form the best opinion I can. That's why I think the residents should make the decision, they of course understand the scenario far better than you or I are ever going to be able to.",False,1647632727.0,t3_th3ycn,t1_i16mv5g,,2,0,0,0,0,0,

People here are saying a lot of things about Russians being too cowardly or content to rise up, but in reality, the sad fact is that many here (I'm writing this from Russia) are still holding on to a frail hope that this madness is just a nightmare that will pass soon, and it doesnt help that the government has done a moderately good job of perpetuating the illusion of normalcy. Besides a few outliers like McDs and a couple of foreign chains packing up, relatively small demonstrations, and an initial panic at the banks, life is more or less continuing here as usual - the bars are still packed, the supermarket shelves full, the prices for many things still the same. 

Important to note I'm writing from St Petersburg which is perhaps the most liberal, European-minded part of Russia, where not a single person I know or have talked to supports the war, and everyone is full of fear and uncertainty about the future. But while people can still work, feed their families, enjoy their hobbies, and live with all their basic needs met, they aren't all that willing to risk throwing their lives away for the mere chance of changing it for the better (Russians are quite aware that usually uprisings here only make things worse for everyone). 

As long as the government has the means to keep this up, they will. Martial law, massive inflationary and unemployment, limited or no access to basic needs - that will turn these small demonstrations into big ones, and once the police state cat is out of the bag, it's not going back in.

And this sort of war is not as simple as 'winning' or 'losing'.

Russia's advance has ground to a halt. They have lost the initiative and momentum, this is a hard thing to regain in war.

The longer Russian forces are in Ukraine, the more it will cost them and Russia's armed forces and equipment are not endless; but it is likely that supplies from the EU will continue for a long time. This will slowly bleed Russia's forces dry.

Russia has also lost a lot of non-kinetic power. Her economy is collapsing, her military reputation is in tatters and she is diplomatically outcast and she is in demographic decline.

Ukraine by no means is 'winning' but her outlook is far more positive and there are some indications of a change in fortunes.

Bottom line - the longer this war goes on, the more Russia will lose and the more likely that Ukraine gets a favourable peace.

 >The use of flags from the Nazi Germany (1933–1945) is currently subject to legal restrictions in a number of countries. While legal in the majority of countries, in several European countries the display of flags associated with the Nazi government (see: Nazi flags) is subject to restriction or an outright ban. Many Nazi flags make use of the swastika symbol; however, the swastika is not always used in connection with the National Socialist German Workers' Party movement or of the German Third Reich or the combined German military of 1933–1945. Outside of Nazism, use of swastikas pre-dates the German Third Reich by some 3,000 years.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Outside on the grounds of the capitol there were armed insurrectionists groups waiting for the police to escalate the situation so that they could return fire and then supply weapons to other people in the mob.

I can open up any novel and easily find a page of no indentations whatsoever, it's entirely depends on the context of the writing and the pacing the author wants to dictate with their prose, among various other things. That is such a laughably low amount of text, if you become tired and lose your place you are probably a 90 year old

>Just break your comment up (as I've done with mine) and you'll achieve the same effect, which will make people much more likely to read it.

No, it's asinine reddit wants to make a new paragraph out of every two sentences. People can type however they want but if you really want to argue grammatical correctness, that is not it.  Anyone who wants to read will do so because the information presented is something they want to engage with, anyone who misses my point because there wasn't a few pixels more in-between certain lines is no one whose opinion I'd respect anyways. 

>Seriously. Imagine picking up and opening a book, and finding all the text resembles what you wrote. You'd put it down, admit it.

Like I said, you can find that in any book. You clearly don't know how authors dictate their stories or why certain things are lengthy instead of short, its not all about the digest of someone who can't be bothered to process basic information if it's not cut up like a sandwich for a toddler.

 >Western betrayal is the view that the United Kingdom, France, and sometimes the United States failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military, and moral obligations with respect to the Czechoslovak and Polish states during the prelude to and aftermath of World War II. It also sometimes refers to the treatment of other Central and Eastern European states at the time. The term refers to several events, including the treatment of Czechoslovakia during the Munich Agreement and the resulting occupation by Germany, as well as the failure of France and the UK to aid Poland when the country was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939.

The proof here would be that the sun has risen every day. Scientists make claims based off of this type of observed hypothesis.

> My claim that the CIA will behave like the CIA has always behaved in conflicts is like claiming the sun will rise tomorrow.

In my opinion this is a bit too ambiguous. Specifically ""the CIA will behave like the CIA has always behaved"" this isn't quite an observable fact like the sun rising unless you specify what specific behavior you are talking about. The sun rising is a specific action that can be confirmed or denied. ""The CIA behaving like the CIA"" can't be confirmed or denied unless you define exactly what 'behaving like the CIA' means. 

With all of this said, I do recognize that CIA has been involved in almost every war in some capacity. So their involvement in Ukraine isn't too far fetched and you aren't too far off with this claim. 


The initial poster claimed their relative believed that:

> US/UK and other nato countries special forces very secretly operating in Ukraine in this conflict.

Claiming US, UK and NATO are performing secret operations in an active war zone that none are apart of is very different than claiming CIA is there because CIA has always been operating in war zones. 

Has US, UK and NATO countries had a history of espionage in wars they are not active in? NATO is a purely defensive alliance and only puts troops in countries that want them, Ukraine is not in NATO.
