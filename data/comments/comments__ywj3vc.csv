Day 266 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Compared to yesterday, today was a very uneventful day for our city, which is good, having nothing happen is definitely better than being rained with missiles. We had no missile strikes, no drones and not many air raid alerts throughout the day. Though in our district we had a blackout lasting 5 hours, from 12pm to 5pm, which is more than the regular 3 hours, but at least it‚Äôs not 8 hours like yesterday.

To hear in the morning that the rocket that fell in Poland was ours was quite unexpected, and it doesn‚Äôt look like our side completely believes in this version yet. We definitely need to take part in the investigation, as excluding us and then saying that we did it, but that nobody is blaming us for it, honestly sounds very sketchy. We need to know if that missile was truly ours, and if it was, then we absolutely need to own it, apologize and compensate the families of the victims, as that is the only right thing to do.

Now if that missile was actually Russian, and especially if it was a deliberate attack to test NATO response, as I was speculating yesterday, then this will be seen as an absolute win by Russia, and there will unquestionably be more escalations in the coming weeks/months, maybe ones also framed as ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù. They would see it this way: they attacked a NATO member, killed its citizens and got away with it, which means that Russia is strong and NATO is weak, so they can do absolutely anything they want with no consequences.

The latter is extremely unlikely at this juncture. So looking at the 'accident' angle, it being a Russian-fired ground attack rocket or Ukrainian-fired air defense missile does not matter. Russia was bombing targets in Western Ukraine, Ukraine was firing rockets in its own defense. Accidents happen. If it was indeed Ukraine, it and Poland will settle the issue like civilized people.

The guilt here is always with Russia, as they were the ones throwing bombs around near Poland, and with them being an agressor who refuses to stop its unilateral attack on Ukraine, who had no choice but to throw its own bombs in self-defense. That's it. Anything else is just feeding the troll noise narrative, downvote them and move on.

There was a global hawk in the area and pictures of the hit area were available. They would know what type of missile it was and the direction it came from. 

If it is this type of missile it wouldn't miss a target by tens of kilometers. The nearest target is a power plant about ~50km from the hit area. That is a massive fuck up. Even if it is a S-300

1. It did malfunction 
2. It got hit by Ukrainian defences but kept going

It seems like the developing story is beginning to support the idea that this missile was a divert/shootdown failure (e.g. a Ukrainian launched weapon that somehow went off course or something), but it really does not matter if this is true or not (perhaps except for condolences and compensation). **There would be no active GBAD/AA systems in Ukraine if not for Russia's continued terror bombing**. Do you think there are active SAMS protecting St. Louis?

But it's worth thinking about the actual worst case: let us *just suppose* that Russia did it; either they were aiming at something ([like a power distribution tower?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNAaD_a0NJY)) and missed, hitting Poland. Or maybe they hit the tower, but the GBAD failed to track or something. Who knows. What about the **worst** case, where we assume Russia intentionally attacked Poland with one cruise missile^[1].

-----

So let's examine the extreme hypothetical:

Even in the **highly unlikely** case that the this missile was launched intentionally by Russia to hit Poland, combined with **highly unlikely** case that NATO somehow *knew* this was intentionally aimed at Poland. Like, we have Boris on the phone saying that he's going to show those Poleskis who is boss, and even in the **highly unlikely** case they were willing to burn this intelligence source to out the Russian bastards.

---

**Even in this case**, the correct decision is to do tomorrow, what we were doing yesterday - supplies, money, and support to Ukraine. In terms of a direct NATO response this will look like ""doing nothing"" which is probably a good thing.

After all, what benefit would NATO have for almost any sort of escalation? Even the mildest thing I can imagine, running e.g. sorties in NATO airspace and just clipping Ukrainian airspace to protect forward - has very little benefit in a ($) cost/benefit analysis (the tragically two killed Polish citizens notwithstanding). And it is a **clear** loss in terms of the propaganda war - handing the Russian enemy ammunition to domestically escalate. And for what? Ukraine is **strongly winning** on the battlefield. They are **strongly winning** in the political battlefield. 

In fact, I'd say it's hard to imagine any reaction other than providing more money and arms to Ukraine, deploying more troops in NATO territories, more defensive systems in NATO territories etc. The obvious things. The correct decision is to take this one on the chin (this is the 2nd missile to end up in Poland, if I recall correctly this happened early in the war) and hope it's not the beginning of a pattern.

-----

**tl;dr** Even if the missile in Poland were entirely intentional, it's hard to see how NATO would benefit from escalation in any way, shape, or form. Unless NATO had intelligence that they were targeting Polish political leadership or military resources or something insane like that, NATO is going to continue to *do tomorrow what it was doing yesterday* because **that is working**.

Ukraine's casualties would be expected to be at their highest at the very beginning before western aid, and in the two most recent months with their most successful counterattacks.

Most of the casualties will be from the north Donbas region, especially around Bakhmut, and before it Severodonetsk/Lysychansk.  Pavlivka right now was pretty bad.  I'd still be surprised if the numbers were anything like Russia's.  It might be as bad as 75% of Russia's, but I'm willing to bet somewhere between that and 50%.  

As for what that actually *means* in the scheme of things, hard to say.  Ukraine has a lot of militia groups that are active regionally.  The actual army is better trained than Russia's but smaller.

Failure of leadership, Putin to be exact, to even know what kind of military ability he had in his own freaking country. The buck stops at Putin. He is the all great leader of everything, so this is his fuckup. So even before the Russian's went in, they had fucked up majorly. They had no accurate idea what awaited, and no accurate idea of their own capabilities. Related to that same corruption, their military leaders are not capable, very incompetent. There was not reward for being a good military leader, lots of reward to be a corrupt incompetent. Again this is Putin's set up, all on him ultimately. Last is the organization of Russian military, no NCO's that have any authority, all top down commands. The troops can't do anything without senior leaders giving an order. See the previous point about incompetent senior leaders. Ukraine appears to have absorbed western war fighting with NCO's that are encouraged to think and fight the best way given the situation. This is how Ukraine, even poorly equipped has run circles around the Russians. Kharkiv was a good example. When they were stomping the Russians they saw they could keep going, and they did, huge victory resulted. That came from the NCO's evaluating the situation, which turned out to be optimal, so they kept going. Russia can't do that. All of this adds up to Russian military failure that we have seen.

1. Russia is morally right here because of the 14000 ukrainian russian bombing victims, it was the only way of preventing this from happening.

2. Russia is right because well the US could bomb Iraq, Afghanistan so why Russia is shunned doing something the like, noo, the world is against our righteous ways of dispensing justice

3. Russia was promised stuff in return for letting Germany unify. Like not extending NATO.

4. NATO wanted to extend to Russia's borders and this was the only way of preventing that.

5. Putin is a macho man, he walks the walk instead of the endless talk of the corrupt western politicians. A man like that is capable of doing what is needed for the glory of Russia.

6. Ukrainians are just as bad as russians just the western media doesnt show how they kill their civilians.

Point 2 is the fallback argument when anything is questioned. It is based on true facts, US fucked up there. 

Point 1 is another main argument, the numbers are high although the distribution is a bit problematic since these numbers are mostly made up by combatants of both sides (like 10000+) and the number of recorded deaths had gone down dramatically since 2018, in 2021 there were 18 or so recorded deaths, most from uxo or mines.

Number 6 is another argument, i assume it tickles their ego to look up to someone strong instead of the weakling western leaders who just talk and talk and don't show *the strength of a real* man (tm). Which is, presumably, to act violently since this is the antithesis of the *weakling*.

One fun counter argument is asking them why all those russians fled to west instead of staying in their glorious country living in the golden era of russian glamor. Another is just flat out saying that the western decadent capitalist slavery is magnitudes better than living as a free man in Russia.

He says that in his opinion it is rather unlikely that a ground-to-air S-300 missile could have done that since they are designed to self-destruct before they hit the ground and there were actually two missiles according to the initial reports.

He thinks it was a deliberate attack by Russia in order to provoke a NATO response, and that the best course of action for both NATO and Ukraine would be to ignore it. 

His reasoning is that if NATO responded with any military action Russia would immediately start shouting that they're under attack by NATO and would call for an immediate cease-fire and negotiations to de-escalate that NATO and Ukraine would not realistically be able to refuse. By doing that Russia would have achieved a cease-fire that they so desperately need, they would have validated their propaganda bullshit about fighting against NATO which would excuse their failures and take pressure off Putin internally, and they would also have created a platform for direct negotiations with US/NATO bypassing Ukraine which is what they also want in order to pretend they can still talk to US as equals.",False,1668614414.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwlo59v,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

So they would probably still admit that it was a Ukrainian missile, still consider it the freak accident that it is, and largely go on as before. There would be a public outcry and panic and debate, but it's not likely to go anywhere.

In terms of public dialogue it would both escalate the calls for arms deliveries to end the war sooner, or the calls for forcing Ukraine and Russia into a settlement, but I doubt any side would accomplish a critical victory on this:

1. A settlement is simply not possible since Ukrainians are radically opposed to giving up territory (Zelensky would probably not politically survive that) and Putin has no intent to withdraw to Ukraine's 2003 borders either. 

2. There are some odds that arms deliveries would increase, and slim odds for a significant increase like sending ATACMS and tanks... but frankly I don't believe in a huge change since NATO countries are pretty clear on their priorities and limits.",1668623462.0,1668623222.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwmajtw,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

This is an older generation ATACMS, but its still classified as a guided ballistic missile by most.

They are much faster than cruise missiles, and this harder to intercept. Due the speed of most ""ballistic missiles"" and the ability to maneuver, the range envelope for interception is dramatically lower for ballistic missiles than cruise missiles or planes for most anti-air systems.

We are talking a reduced range of engagement down to 10-30 miles, vs 100 miles, with a fairly low probability of successful engagement.

Essentially very fast evasively maneuvering quasi-ballistic missiles are very hard to shoot down, not easier.

Also you know the locations of air defense systems, maneuverable ballistic missiles, and be programmed to fly basically a path between air defense systems to minimize the chance of interception.

The Russian Iskander theoretically is capable of these things too.

Also, systems designed specifically to shot down these kinds of missiles fire hideously expensive missiles. The RIM-161 fired by the US Aegis system has a unit cost of $11 million per missile. 

TLDR: Most anti air systems were not designed to intercept ballistic or quasi-ballistic missiles, and have very low probabilities of interception.",1668614463.0,1668614092.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwlkz3n,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Soviet/Russian missiles fail in all kind of weird and wonderful ways. There's so many videos about this. Then Soviets/Russians were not that into safety systems as well. E.g. Russian space going rockets even today do not have flight termination system resulting in failures [like this][1].

 - can have a low radar cross section because building a 20-foot long cruise missile out of radar-absorbing composites is WAY cheaper than building a 50' ballistic missile booster (which also has to withstand high stress of launch).
 - Ironically: using a hypersonic cruise missile can foil some of these low-observability qualities: you usually have to use a rocket engine: which is likely to be detected by satellite; even air-dropped, and you have to fly at a higher altitude, because sustained hypersonic flight at 70m is a problem I don't think ANYONE is anywhere near close to solving.",1668620259.0,1668619930.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwltvlc,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Russia does not have any illusions about the capabilities of the United States. At the moment, the United States is beating Russia and the United States is not even a party in this war.

The point of my post was exactly to take the worst unrealistic case and show how - even *in* that unrealistic case, the correct action for now is to do the same thing that we did yesterday.

One data point is not a pattern, and one missile impact is plausibly an accident. Given the decision tree NATO has in front of them, which mind you has a lot of nuclear weapon usage on various leaves - even if those leaves are far down the tree - it is helpful to give your opponent - yes, even the evil Russian empire themselves for which NATO was created - the benefit of the doubt because it literally makes sense *for all parties* involved.",False,1668593716.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwkny14,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

This is where we totally diverge.

The entire point of this war is the disentangling of one actor (Russia) attempting to use the *threat* of nuclear war against a nuclear power (NATO) as a way to keep opponents stood off against a conventional adversary (Ukraine).

This whole war is literally **about** exactly how NATO and Russia and others are going to delineate how this works in the future.

> The demand to stop attacks on NATO members or else NATO will defend itself with conventional strikes on attacking bombers would be completely reasonable and covered by article 5. Nukes aren't the only option NATO has and in any case the worst.

I agree in principle, but I think NATO and I are on the same page: In 266 days of warfare, there have been to my knowledge (2) instances where impact events happened on NATO territory. Out of many thousands of missile launches, this is probably remarkably good.

The real threat (which you have not mentioned) is specifically that this kind of probing attack is done in a way that would otherwise mimic a genuine attack or a nuclear attack (with a weapon which has a similar profile).

Even in that case, I still think the correct thing to do is to evaluate the failure of your defense systems and essentially do nothing for now.

You don't have to prove you are a credible opponent every single day of every single week to be believed.

Hell, Russia supposedly has still not eliminated a single HIMARS launcher. A single weapons system is already such a strong deterrent that Russia can't cope with it.

Western Ukraine is already pretty secure for a country at war. The flow of goods to Ukraine has been very successful, the Russians completely unable to stop it. I would argue flying goods directly to Ukraine makes the supply lines more vulnerable because it puts the planes on ground that *isn't* a NATO country. The Russians wouldn't dare attack a Polish airport, they would have no problems attacking the few Ukranian ones that can handle large cargo planes. Plus they already have to load supplies onto trains for transport to the east and southern fronts, seems like more risk to save an extra hundred or so kilometers of train travel.

Prepping meals can be done anywhere but most would be done very close to the front when possible, troops love hot fresh food. For long lasting rations those can be shipped in. Repair of h any equipment is already being done just accross the border, once again more risk to save a couple km at most train hour journey and you already have to load it onto a train anyway. And once again very little is actually being damaged in far western Ukraine compared to closer to the front and it's nothing like a heavy bombing campaign you'd have seen in Vietnam, Korea or world war 2. Yes the electrical grid has been damage lately but it's really not having that much affect on the war effort.

Having any NATO presence in Ukraine drastically escalates the war and brings it closer to a confrontation between nuclear powers.

You lot make me laugh. I never said NATO wouldn't win, did i?

You think if you sent NATO ground troops into \*only\* Ukraine there would not be huge loss of life? The U.S. lost 10k men fighting in the middle east and the taliban don't have tactical ballistic missiles.

Of course NATO would win but in order to carry out a ground operation you need air and artillery support which would involve taking out AD and surface to surface launch sites inside Russia and Belarus as well as the black sea. That would probably constitute an existential threat to Russia in their nuclear doctrine and legitimize first use.

History has told us countless times that a combined arms approach is the only option in a near peer conflict. You can't send NATO into just Ukraine without having to also target places in Russia. You can't limit your own forces operationally like that without huge casualties.

>It's the nukes that make it a bad move. Russia would certainly see that as existential and launch. Given the state of the rest of the military I wouldn't be shocked if many of their nukes are no longer operational, but only a few have to be to inflict massive destruction.

My entire point is that limiting intervention to just Ukraine would be akin to Russian's ""special military operation"" at the start of the war - i.e. you're fighting with one arm behind your back and basically betraying your own troops because many will have preventable deaths if you are unwilling to take out AD and surface to surface launch sites both in Russia and in the black sea.

Once you commit to that you are basically gambling with the lives of millions that Russia won't follow its own nuclear doctrine.

I can disagree with another person's position and still consider their position reasonable.

As an example, as I have repeatedly stated in numerous reddit comments (that apparently you still haven't bothered to look at), Ukrainians are who decides when/if Ukraine starts the negotiations to end this war. (edit also as I have repeatedly posted, that the 1991 borders are non-negotiable)

This is also Gen. Milley's position, but he stated that the onset of winter could open a window for such negotiations that could be in Ukraine's favor. This is a perfectly reasonable position for him to take from a strategic and tactical viewpoint, which is the viewpoint that one should expect from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It's like, their job?

So I agree with him that Ukraine should decide when the negotiations begin, and I can also say things like ""his view on the fact that winter may open a good opportunity to start said negotiations, due to how fucked the Russians are going to get come winter. (this is me paraphrasing because you can't be bothered to watch the vid i kindly linked for you)"" and think that that particular position is completely reasonable.

Gen. Milley is onside with Ukraine. I am onside with Ukraine. You are onside with Ukraine.

Personally I tend to let experts (like Gen. Milley) lead in their area of expertise. This tendency of people to be mad at him came out of an anonymously sourced NYT article from last week, the man has clarified it in a way that is 100% satisfactory to me, as a supporter of Ukraine since Maidan.

At this point I'm not even sure what we're arguing about? Gen. Milley has made it clear in word and deed that he supports Ukraine. He's not the bad guy you seem to think he is.",1668649477.0,1668649249.0,t3_ywj3vc,t1_iwnwerh,,3,2,0,2,0,0,
