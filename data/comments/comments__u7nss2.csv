It shows a group of teachers in Chernihiv inspecting their school following the fighting that had been taking place there. The Russians had set up camp there and the level of squalor they were living in is... atrocious, honestly. Garbage everywhere, literal human shit on the floor, empty liquor bottles scattered around, etc. They had a message scrawled on the entry to their makeshift field hospital warning their own people not to loot medicine. It frankly left me kind of speechless. Needless to say the teachers were horrified at the mess that was left behind.

I went ahead and typed up the transcript.

> One of my comrades who came back from the frontline for reorganisation asked to briefly and clearly (without going into depths of warfare science) to sum up and express my thoughts that I listed in a discussion with him, revolving around my 'pessimism' towards the success of the 'second stage' of this SMO (Special Military Operation). - He believes someone might find this useful. I think that no one from those making decisions will pay any attention, but I made a promise, so here it is:

> In short, let's evaluate the operational situation:

> 1. From our side, after the 'successful completion of the first stage of the operation' (which ended with a large-scale RETREAT from Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts), a relocation and concentration of the forces in the Donetsk region of the frontline has occurred. Most likely (and according to the official statements of the political command of RF), this is precisely where they are planning to conduct the 'second stage', and complete the objective of totally clearing the territories of L/DPR of the enemy's formations. Obviously, they count on creating 2-3 offensive groupings with enough manpower, which, with concentrated support of all available aviation and the majority of artillery forces, will 'break through' the Ukrainian forces (which are still for some reason not appreciated highly enough), and destroy them in one large battle.

> 2. From the UAF side: the plans of RF AF are very clear to the enemy, and they do not at all consider their defeat inevitable. In fact, the opposite - UAF are planning to defend in their highly fortified positions, relying on old and newly created (RF AF gave them plenty of time for that) positions at assumed directions of the Russian Forces strikes (which are obvious - just look at the map).
Let's ask a question - can the supremacy of Russian AF in aviation and heavy weaponry guarantee a victory over the enemy (for whom the offensive plans are obvious?), who is prepared for defence, possessing a high moral spirit? My answer is - NO, not guaranteed.

> Why?- My answer:

> The 'supremacy' of Russian AF in aviation and artillery is quite relative. Since the enemy has a well-equipped and numerous military Anti-Aircraft capabilities, which severely limits actions of the tactical aviation capable of supporting its own troops on the battlefield. The enemy holds AN ADVANTAGE in terms of field and artillery reconnaissance (UAVs of various classes on nearly squad level). Their artillery has great weaponry and excellent trained personnel. And fighting against numerous Russian armoured vehicles - UAF (in defence) is quite capable of this due to massive amounts of anti-tank weapons among infantry (ATGM).

> In conditions where Russian troops will have to storm one city agglomeration after another, numbers of troops come to the foreground. And in this regard, neither RF AF nor L/DPR AF have a serious advantage, unfortunately.

> Let's imagine that the first line of defence of UAF south of Izyum and near Huliaipole is broken and our forces begin offensive in convergent directions.

> Can they quickly link up in deep Ukrainian rears, creating two encirclement rings (inner and outer)? With a guarantee that the enemy won't break them immediately and won't create their own 'sailients' for the advancing forces? (Germans did this on multiple occasions in 1942 with our forces).

> I doubt it. Why? - Because for that you need A LOT of detachments aimed not only for breaking through but also for firmly establishing in the territories. You also need a large amount of supply detachments. If the enemy had innumerous forces - you could partially ignore defence of communications. Yet UAF (thanks to mobilisation) have enough forces comparable to our own numbers. Moreover, the enemy has the ability to reduce the frontline and transfer freed forces towards endangered directions - RF does not have complete supremacy in the air simply due to a lack of numbers in attack aviation, and tiny numbers of attack UAVs. At the same time, the frontline near Donetsk can be held by the enemy with relatively small numbers thanks to excellent engineering equipment, developed over years, while our genius politicians were 'chewing Minsk snivel:

> With this in mind, I presume that the general lack of forces will not allow the Russian command to conduct a 'deep envelopment in Dnipro region'. They simply don't have enough manpower for this. So the offensive will be carried out in the shortest directions - in the north towards Slovyansk-Kramatorsk (at best, towards Barvenkovo), in the south - on the Uhledar-Kurahovo line. Both mentioned operational lines will inevitably lead our troops to face the large, highly fortified, and well-prepared defensive garrisons in numerous city agglomerations. In fact, the enemy still retains control over roads between them, which they can use to continue supplying their troops.

> So, after a certain time, in this area, the same situation will repeat as in Rubezhnoe-Severodonetsk, Popasnaya, Avdeevka and Maryinka, where united forces are advancing extremely slowly and with huge losses (especially among infantry), or not moving at all (Avdeevka).

> The enemy is more than happy with such a way to conduct combat operations. Why? - Because UAF need 1,5-2 (at best, 3) months to prepare significant reserves - not in the form of constant reinforcements into existing forces (they are already happening, supporting on a very decent level the numbers of troops directly engaged in combat), but in the form of detachments that can be used in other strategic directions, while Russian forces are 'bleeding' storming fortified cities in Donbas.

> In the worst case scenario, we can repeat the situation similar to one that happened for the Wehrmacht during operation 'Citadel'. While Germans were slowly gnawing through the deeply reinforced defence of soviet troops, wasting time and their saved reserves, Soviet command concentrated in the north (around Belgorod and Oryol) a large group of own troops not engaged in the battle. When it started a counter-offensive, Germans 'suddenly found out' that there was not enough power to simultaneously continue operation 'Citadel' and defend from counter-offensive of soviet troops.

> The operation had to be ended and battered troops had to be returned to their original positions. And then, more or less orderly retreat (which did not always happen for Germans) behind Dnipro. With this in mind, I would also remind you that the so-called 'ukraine' is finishing its THIRD STAGE OF THE TOTAL MOBILISATION. 

> They have manpower (200-300 thousand people) and equipment (a huge stream of all kinds of weapons from Europe and USA) to not only support a decent number of their own troops at the frontline, but also create new reserves. And create them in 'numbers' (even 100,000 people is around 50 BTGs, including reinforcements and rear infrastructures - so around 10 full-bodied divisions).

> What about us? We are conducting recruitment into various private military organisations, recruiting contractors in enlistment offices, and... and that's all. L/DPR (in terms of mobilisation) are completely drained, and those who are 'still to be caught', will only replenish existing and future losses. Let's say, thanks to private companies we are able to create 10 (even 20) various squads and BTGs. And then? Losses taken in Donbas (storming more fortresses will result in these being VERY HIGH) will need to be compensated somehow.

> In general, HOW can the Russian command in two-three months 'parry' a concentration of fresh UAF forces, for instance, at the borders of Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts? And if they start an offensive - what will we have to defend them? Police, 'alcoCossacks' (all real Cossacks are already on the frontline), or regional militia? This regional militia has not yet even been created! No one is speaking about this...

> Or did our military 'arranged in advance' with the enemy that they (the enemy) will act strictly within the plans of our Orthodox General Staff? In the first stage of 'SMP' this did not seem to happen at all. With serious losses for the participants. I don't think the second stage will be much different - Ukrainians are definitely not planning to act as 'boys for beating'

> So, drawing a conclusion, I note:

> Without conducting at least a partial mobilisation in RF it is impossible to conduct deep strategic advancing operations in so-called 'ukraine', impossible and extremely dangerous. We need to prepare for a long and difficult war, which will require all human resources, which are now uselessly wasted to have 'another flag over a city council' (Hostomel and Bucha, showed how quickly the flags can be changed).

> And yes, I would really like to be mistaken in my predictions for the operation that has started (the 'second stage'). But the grande with which these hedonists that shat themselves on many occasions, these lying babblers, and mediocrities, are presenting it - is not giving me extra optimism. NO CONCLUSIONS from the failures of the first two months - in a strategic sense - have been made.

If the deal holds, it will be the first agreement reached on creating a safe corridor for civilians to flee Mariupol to other Ukrainian cities since March 5.

The March poll was the first to show a majority of Swedes in favour of joining Nato.

Here's what the head of Russia's central bank said in their parliament.

in an appearance at the lower house of parliament, Elvia Nabiullina, chair of the Russian Central Bank, gave a more far-reaching, negative assessment of Russia's economy. She told lawmakers that although the sanctions’ effect had largely been on the financial markets at first, they “will now begin to increasingly affect the real sectors of the economy.”

For example, she said, “practically every product” manufactured in Russia relies on imported components. Factories, for now, may still have them in stock. But because of new Western export restrictions, Russian companies will be forced to shift their supply chains or start making their own components.

“At the moment, perhaps this problem is not yet so strongly felt, because there are still reserves in the economy, but we see that sanctions are being tightened almost every day,” she said. “But the period during which the economy can live on reserves is finite.”

Nabiullina, an internationally respected central banker who reportedly tried to resign in the days after the war, said about half of the central bank’s $600 billion foreign currency and gold reserves remained frozen because of sanctions.

Yes the actions of previous governments and administrations in many countries have lead to this complex geopolitical, economic and military situation where we cannot simply untie from Russia.

Right now multiple heads of states are 'walking back' words and adapting to the situation. Make no mistake, not all of this is genuine walking back. If the majority of countries continued to saber rattle and increase the stakes, what would Russia do next?

Since before the war began, the western intelligence services have been providing an incredibly strong, accurate picture that prevented Russia from launching false flag attacks to support the invasion. They've provided information to Ukraine while working with other agencies to build the best possible picture of what is going on inside Russia, specifically the Kremlin and military.

There is no reason to assume that the current situation is no different. There is likely reason behind Scholz and Macron staying further back from their Polish and US counter parts. We do not have the full picture, we do not what is being said or coordinated on behalf of the 'allies'.

Scholz and Macron may have their own roles to play in this, as has been agreed upon. Germany is already moving incredibly fast to remove dependency, while France has indicated building a range of new reactors over the next 20 years. This is more significant than you might think due to the combined EU grid. Overall, the shift in power policy that has already been agreed upon is huge, showing that all countries are doing their part.

This goes for Zelensky too. He has his role to play for the successful outcome for Ukraine. He no doubt knows this more than anyone after having to deal with Trump and his administration. Asking for a no fly zone and constantly addressing parliaments has a purpose.

I know it's frustrating to read the constant barrage of war crimes, atrocities and loss of innocent civilian lives, all because of the whims of a mad man. It's frustrating that we do not see our elected leaders acting in the ways we want them to. But please trust that right now, the many thousands of intelligence officials, military personnel, human rights lawyers and public servants are all working to support Ukraine in the defense of its sovereignty.

So while I absolutely encourage criticism of government (even in the good times), have some faith that the system that has helped Ukraine so significantly so far, is still working as intended and the plans are still being executed, even if publicly, the roles may appear as something else.

**TL:DR; A large part of war is the propaganda. While some heads of state are walking back words, don't confuse this with actual action of reducing support. The entirety of the west/allies are working well together to create the best possible opportunity for Ukraine to win and for Russia/Putin to be defeated. Everyone has a role to play.**",1650453948.0,1650453232.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,129,0,129,0,0,

**Russian military building on border - UK defence ministry:**

Away from the siege in Mariupol, this week has seen Russia launch a new military offensive along its 300-mile eastern front with Ukraine.

The UK Ministry of Defence has set out it's latest assessment of the situation on the ground.

It says Russia's military presence there continues to build, while fighting in the Donbas region is intensifying, as Russian forces seek to break through Ukrainian defences,

Russian air activity in northern Ukraine is likely to remain low since its withdrawal from north of Kyiv, an intelligence update says.

""However, there is still a risk of precision strikes against priority targets throughout Ukraine,"" it adds.

""Russian attacks on cities across Ukraine show their intent to try and disrupt the movement of Ukrainian reinforcements and weaponry to the east of the country.""

During his nightly address posted to social media Wednesday night, Zelensky said he and Michel discussed specific ways the EU can help Ukraine, regarding providing aid —particularly defense, finances and sanctions.

""Another great topic of our discussion is our advancement toward integration,” Zelensky said.

“We have already proved that Ukrainian state and civic institutions are effective enough to withstand a war ordeal,” Zelensky added, “We have already been doing for the defense of freedom on the European continent so much that it hasn't been the other nations' lot to do.”

Michel and Zelensky also discussed specific steps to restore Ukraine after the war, and how the EU and Ukraine can work together to diminish threats from Russia regarding food, energy and safety in Europe and the rest of the world.

“To resume export of Ukrainian agrarian products and to disable Russia's blackmailing with energy resources — those are top priorities for everyone on the continent,” Zelensky said.

Zelensky said after Michel and his team visited Borodianka in the Kyiv region, they “made a very correct conclusion: there cannot be peace without justice.”

The Ukrainian president said he also discussed strengthening sanctions with Michel.

“At present European Union is working on the sixth package of sanctions,” Zelensky said, “We discussed this matter with Charles Michel today. We are making sure that it is truly painful for the Russian war machine and the Russian state in general.”

He added that in all negotiations, he has emphasized that sanctions are not needed as an end in itself, but as an “instrument to make Russia seek peace.”",False,1650490517.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

After seizing the town of Kreminna over the weekend and advancing toward the villages of Torske and Zelena Dolyna, Russian forces are regrouping ahead of a renewed push toward the town of Lyman, northeast of one of the main cities in Ukrainian-held Donbas, Slovyansk, the Ukrainian military added.

Ukraine is reinforcing its units in the area while also trying to counterattack southeast of the city of Kharkiv in an effort to disrupt Russian supply lines and cut off the forces that massed for the main thrust of the offensive in the town of Izyum. Ukrainian forces have also destroyed a dam on the Oskol river, leading to flooding in the area and making roads and fields impassable to Russian armor—a tactic that Ukrainian defenders successfully deployed northwest of the capital, Kyiv, in March.

…

In the unfolding battle for Donbas, Ukraine possesses a fraction of the artillery and armor that Russia has deployed to the front line. Moscow also has an overwhelming advantage in aviation, using jet fighters, helicopter gunships and armed drones. It is firing dozens of cruise missiles daily at targets in Donbas and across the country, with Ukraine’s weak air defenses able to shoot down only a handful.

Ukraine’s government has been asking its Western partners for months to supply it with more heavy weapons, particularly long-range artillery, tanks, wide-area air-defense systems and aircraft. The U.S. and some allies are only now beginning to respond to these requests, moving from the earlier policy of mostly providing portable short-range weapons such as Javelin and NLAW antitank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles.

“If we had obtained in the first week of the war what we are receiving today, it would have been much more useful for Ukraine and the cause of freedom in Europe,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his Tuesday night address. “And if we obtain now what some of our partners plan to transfer to Ukraine in coming weeks, it would help save the lives of thousands and thousands of people.”

For those who don't know Igor Girkin is a former FSB agent who was the main man behind the theft of Crimea in 2014 and the head of the Donbas Russian terrorist armies for a while. He has more insider info than anyone speaking publicly on the Russian side and a lot more actual knowledge than politruks like Shoigu that are currently leading the Russian army.

Summary of what he says with emphasis on what I think is surprising.

\-Russia still underestimates the Ukrainian forces

\-Ukraine has good fortifications in the area and their morale is very high. Russia thinks it is inevitable the ukr will be defeated but Ukr don't think so

\-Ukraine has an advantage in anti air and anti tank and Russian airplanes will not be as efficient as predicted even though Russian airplanes outnumber UKR ones.

**- The Russian axis of attack are very predictable and Ukrainians are ready for them with fortified positions (no more surprise element compared to the Northern front)**

\-Russian armies are already suffering big loses for small gains and they can be encircled

\-He predicts Ukraine can actually invade in Russian territory in case they want to because no one is left to defend the actual territory of Russia. The regional militias to defend Russia haven't even been formed yet in Russia.

\-Ukraine has advantage in mobilisation while the troops that Russia brings through private hiring are mostly to supplement the loses they already sustained. **LNR/DPR are drained in terms of mobilisation (they can't get more troops from the local population)!**

\-Russian generals expect Ukraine to behave in a predictable way and submit but so far they haven't and they won't.

\-General criticism about incompetency of Russian generals

According to the information received by the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, “Major General of the Interior of the People's Republic of Belarus” Major Oleksandr Kornet, born on April 29, 1973, was arrested by the Russian FSB and is currently being held in the FSB detention center in Rostov-on-Don.

The arrest of the ""Minister of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China"" provoked a negative reaction from the security forces and the political leadership of the ""republic"", which assessed this as the beginning of changes in the power bloc of the quasi-state. However, the head of LNR Pasichnyk LI is making every effort to release Cornet from custody and reinstate him.

Thus, the ""cleansing"" in the so-called political leadership. The Luhansk People's Republic testifies to Moscow's recognition of its inability to carry out its tasks by the current leaders of the Luhansk People's Republic in the context of the war with Ukraine. Due to personnel changes and intimidation of the leadership of the quasi-republic, Russia is trying to establish effective work to mobilize human resources in the temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk region to quickly compensate for losses in units and units of the 2nd AK of the Russian occupation forces and continue hostilities against Ukraine.""

From CNN's Kylie Atwood, Alex Marquardt, Kaitlan Collins, Jennifer Hansler and Oren Liebermann

The US is preparing another $800 million security assistance package for Ukraine, according to three senior administration officials and two sources familiar with the planning.

Details of the latest package were still being discussed and could change, but earlier Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said the US plans to send more artillery to Ukraine. 

Upon arrival in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Biden was asked by reporters on the tarmac if he plans to send more artillery to Ukraine.

Per the pool, Biden told reporters, “Yes,” before boarding his motorcade.

One senior administration official said the newest package could be approved within the next 36 hours, though another administration official said the timing isn’t locked down and it could be within the coming days. 

The size of the package could also change at the last minute, the second official said.

The latest package comes just a week after the Biden administration authorized another $800 million security package, which included artillery and anti-artillery radars for the first time since the Russian invasion began.

The Biden administration is working to get the security assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible because they believe the war is in a critical stage and the continued US assistance could make a difference when Russia’s more aggressive assault begins in Eastern Ukraine, the third administration officials said. 

The more open terrain in that region favors the use of artillery and long-range systems, which is why the administration has placed a premium on getting those types of systems in quickly as the fighting moves away from Kyiv and into the Donbas region.

The region also borders Russia, allowing the Russian forces to maintain shorter supply lines needed to sustain an assault. Ukraine and Russia, through its own forces and proxies, have fought in the Donbas region for the last eight years, making it familiar territory for both forces.",False,1650427970.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

“Certainly they (Russians) are spreading out a lot,"" he said. ""We’ve established our defenses in a lot of towns. They’re trying to encircle our troops, a lot of nasty business is going on there…but they haven’t had any successes so far. We are doing well to destroy their equipment.”

Haidai added: “We have a very serious situation here. The whole of Luhansk territory is being shelled. There is no safe town… We understand that the Russian government is going to push ahead and going to destroy everything in its path. So what we are doing is trying to evacuate everyone as much as possible.”

The official has been appealing to remaining civilians to leave the eastern region of Ukraine as fighting intensifies. He said out of the 350,000 people that lived in the Ukrainian territory of Luhansk before the war, around 70,000 remain today

Lanchesters Laws are the oldest war-math equations, and describe ancient warfare all the way through much of World War 2 battles very well.

One factor that makes ancient war mathematically similar to artillery war at range is, in ancient wars one solider could kill one enemy at one time. In artillery warfare with little knowledge of your enemies position, you fire from your area blindly into theirs. Larger armies in small areas are easier to hit randomly, and so the size of the army and the size of the area it controls opposed to an enemy with certain size and area exchange with each other in equal measure in proportion to their population and region of control.

This is to say that Lanchesters Equations apply very well to dumb ammunition, as well as confrontational gun battles.

But in the West we have guided ammunition.

Per wiki ""During the First Gulf War guided munitions accounted for only 9% of weapons fired, but accounted for 75% of all successful hits. Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets, they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped.""

Guided Munitions aimed at targets you can see (from outer space, or from the NSA) are better modeled under the Salvo Combat Model. The Salvo Model is usually for Naval Combat, but as Ukraine and Russia appear to be headed towards a war settled by artillery, the Salvo Combat Model applies. The similarities are that the cannon has the role of a ship, and the guided munition counts as a cruise missile.

There really isn't a model for a combat system that can use the Salvo Combat Model with smart munitions and knowledge of enemy positions, combating an army only capable of effectively unaimed fire. Once the Western supplied artillery munitions come to bare it should be devastating for Russia.

The West will also have to keep Ukrainian air defenses well supplied to carry this out.",1650431362.0,1650431185.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

She told lawmakers that although the sanctions’ effect had largely been on the financial markets at first, they “will now begin to increasingly affect the real sectors of the economy.”

For example, she said, “practically every product” manufactured in Russia relies on imported components. Factories, for now, may still have them in stock. But because of new Western export restrictions, Russian companies will be forced to shift their supply chains or start making their own components.

“At the moment, perhaps this problem is not yet so strongly felt, because there are still reserves in the economy, but we see that sanctions are being tightened almost every day,” she said. “But the period during which the economy can live on reserves is finite.”

Nabiullina, an internationally respected central banker who reportedly tried to resign in the days after the war, said about half of the central bank’s $600 billion foreign currency and gold reserves remained frozen because of sanctions. Those reserves that the bank still controlled, she said, were mainly gold and yuan — of little use in trying to stabilize the ruble — forcing the bank to resort to capital controls such as limiting how much foreign currency can be taken out of the country.",False,1650473259.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

Javelins, manpads and stingers are mostly useful for guerrilla warfare. U stay next to a road with them and blast unsuspecting Russian columns. Or use them to defend in an urban setting. Ukraine doesn't want to get involved in a long multi year guerrilla war with the Russian army. They don't want to become a Vietnam or Afghanistan. They want to take their country back and continue life in a prosperous way asap.

Tanks, artillery and airplanes will allow the Ukrainian army to take on the Russian army in head on battles. Cause without air support the Russian army can get cooked very easily. Ukraine can also get back city easier with tanks.

The argument that Ukraine has more anti tank weapons than Russia has tanks is kinda invalid outside of a guerrilla war framework cause in the main Russian offensives the Russian tanks are supported by airplanes and artillery and drones. And Russia has more airplanes and artillery than Ukraine which is why Ukrainians have been yelling from the rooftops about airplanes and artillery since like the beginning of the war.

I find that highly suspicious, and I suspect its a narrative being pushed hard by Russian bots, and that lots of frustrated Ukraine supporters have been drawn in and piled onto the narrative, not realizing what damage they are doing to Ukraine by doing so. The single most succesful Russian foreign policy move the later years has been attacks, openly and clandestine on European and trans-Atlantic unity. The single greatest factor that has aided Ukraine outside its borders has been the unity of the coalition against Russia in response to its attack. That coalition has tons of members that could have done more to help Ukraine earlier, yet Germany is still singled out. 

&nbsp;

I'm going to use my own country as an example; Norway. Did you know that Norway has *extensive* cooperation with Russia? There's been lots of cross-border coop, and still is in some regards. There are Norwegian companies working in Russia that has still not announced stopping to do so. Up until very recently Russians avoided the flight ban by flying to Murmansk, then driving a car over the border for then to proceed on to their holiday destination by flight from inside Norway? Norway has taken in tens of thousands of Russian workers over the last decades, ranging from manual labor to engineers, of which a lot have Russian passports and still work in Norway. Norways prime minister, who incidentally goes under the nickname ""the Duke of Fog"", because he is so politically ""smooth"" that he never can give a clear answer to anything, has deliberatly laid low and kept his anti Russia retoric to an expected minimum and nothing more. Yet Germany is called out, and we are not. I want to repeat what I said in response to yet another post attacking Germany yesterday;

>Its insanely frustrating seeing uninformed people like you take a dump at Germany, when the cause of the problem is Russia. Had you paid attention, you'd have seen how internal German politics has practically undergone a revolution and a full 180 since the invasion. They have promised to cut all oil imports by end of year, all gas imports by 2024, have increased their current defence budget by 5 times what it was, overnight, and has sent more money and more military aid than all but 3-4 other European nations and more financial aid than practically any of them. But good for you, harping on the talking points russian bots are trying to push through to sabotage European unity against Russia by creating division. Effectively aiding Ukraines enemy, I guess? Did it make you feel better? Yeah, the policy of gas lines to Russia was dumb. But we accomplish nothing by beating people up about it now, when they are trying to fix it.

Early in Russia’s expanded offensive in the Donbas, the US assesses there have been no major territorial gains for Russia so far since the start of the new push, according to two senior US officials with direct knowledge of the assessment.

The US has observed some new attacks by Russian forces, which appear to be probing attacks to test Ukrainian defenses, one of the officials said. However, the frontlines remain static with no major territory changing hands as of yet.  

To help prepare Ukrainian forces for the battles to come, a new $800 million weapons package will be focused on artillery, specifically 155mm howitzers and ammunition, according to a senior US official and a congressional source with knowledge of the draft plan.

The current situation is that an unknown number of pro-Ukrainian forces (estimated between 800 and 2500) are holed up in a fortified industrial complex called Azovstal.

The Russians, on the other hand, have committed about 12 tactical battalions to taking the city, and occupy most of the city. We know that when at full strength these tend to have between 800-1000 troops. We also know that Russian units are almost never at full strength, and Russia has sustained significant losses during this battle. I would venture that Russia has between 6000-8000 troops inside the city at this time, but exact numbers are difficult to come by.

Since the start of the battle, Ukrainian forces have performed extremely well due to being, on average, much better equipped than their Russian counterparts. Items like secure radios, optic lenses, thermal vision, and shoulder fired guided weapons are very important in urban warfare, where line of sights are generally reduced and the battle space is unpredictable. It is likely that this equipment advantage has lessened over time due to Ukraine having difficulties resupplying the city’s defenders.

The Russians have relied heavily on their overwhelming artillery and air support advantage, pounding what they assess to be Ukrainian defensive positions. This has damaged or demolished over 80% of the buildings in the city, no doubt killing or displacing hundreds of thousands of civilians. These artillery strikes have not yet been wholly effective in dislodging the Ukrainian forces, however. This is possibly due to Russians being unable to reliably locate Ukrainian forces, or perhaps their over reliance on unencrypted communications has allowed the Ukrainians to stay one step ahead of them.

All we can say is that some combination of factors has enabled a severely outnumbered group of fighters to hold out for weeks against impossible odds. It isn’t possible for us to know in more detail what the situation on the ground is, or how it has developed over the past month and a half. Perhaps in the future more information will trickle out and we will be able to have a clearer view of what happened.

I hope that against all odds, the remaining defenders will be able to hold the city until help arrives or the Russians give up. A recent comment by a US DoD official gives me some amount of hope— he said that the US is doing what it can to prevent Mariupol from falling into Russian hands. Perhaps enough help will come before it is too late, and the brave fighters will live to tell us about the battle themselves.",False,1650427841.0,t3_u7nss2,t3_u7nss2,,0,16,0,16,1,0,

(CNN)

A Russian-backed separatist leader said that the so-called Donetsk People's Republic would support a Russian-occupied district in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region after it purportedly made what he called “an appeal"" to secede from Ukraine and join the breakaway republic.

Separatist leader Denis Pushilin made his comments to Russian state media outlet Russia-24 on Tuesday, saying that the separatist republic would not immediately accept the district into its ""administrative border,"" but instead would resolve that question at a later date. 

Video published by a Russian journalist on Tuesday claimed that the Rozovsky district, which is located just 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Mariupol, held a vote on Tuesday in favor of seceding from Ukraine to join Pushilin's Russia-backed separatist region. 

CNN is not airing the video because it could not verify its authenticity, that it was taken in the Rozovsky district, that the individuals were actually Ukrainian citizens, or that they were not pressured into voting in favor of the measure.

> India abstained on the last UNGA resolution which suspended Russia from the Human Rights Council. Explaining India’s vote, the Indian ambassador strongly condemned civilian killings in Bucha while reiterating India’s unwavering commitment to Human Rights. India’s abstention should not be construed as supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
> 
> Consistent with its advocacy of ending violence, not violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and adhering to the principles of UN Charter, India has abstained on all the UN resolutions on the Ukraine situation so far. The key point of Indian approach is that violence should end and the concerned parties should resolve their differences through dialogue and diplomacy. Naming and shaming one party (i.e Russia) will not help solve the problems.
> 
> Reasons why India cannot criticise Russia
> There are strong reasons why India cannot openly criticise Russia as the Western countries would like it to do. First, Russia has been a friend that has stood with India over the decades on critical issues be it on Kashmir, or during the Bangladesh liberation war in 1971. The former Soviet Union had repeatedly exercised veto at the UNSC on the Kashmir question in the past. The USSR’s political, economic and technical help to India in its early years has been invaluable.
> 
> Second, Indian armed forces are significant users of Russian military equipment and spare parts to this day. The two countries have several joint ongoing military projects, of which Brahmos supersonic cruise missiles, which India is going to export to the Philippines, is one. Although India has diversified the procurement of weapons and arms from the US, France and Israel, the Russian equipment in use cannot be replaced for decades.
> 
> For India, the current conflict is not of its making. It is already affecting the Indian economy adversely as global energy and commodity prices rise. The threat of the Ukraine conflict morphing into a devastating global war in which nuclear weapons might be used can no longer be dismissed. Taking sides among parties will only harden the divisions. Sanctions on Russia are of questionable utility. Prime Minister Modi has said that India stands on the side of peace.

Further, by using ultimatums that give the enemy a choice to surrender by a certain date or be killed, one guarantees that any respected leader of the enemy can keep the fight going. If the leader can keep the troops in line and keep telling them about all the dehumanizing propaganda being fed to the invaders, then that deadline will surely pass… Now the enemy knows they are fighting to the death. Propaganda is brutal. Why else was the WW2 eastern front so bloody and the Japanese so suicidal? They thought they were fighting to the death, even when it wasn’t true.

Why else does Russia keep using ultimatums? They realized that their initial ultimatum was being used against them to further entrench Ukrainian resolve. The initial window passed, now it’s a fight to the death. Such a fight is going to be very costly for the invader now.

So they need to keep offering windows for surrendering. However, think about it, if you were fighting someone and they said surrender now or if you lose later I’ll kill you even if you are unarmed and lost, that will only reinforce your negative views about them. 

On the other hand, by constantly offering surrendering windows, it might have the effect of giving the Ukrainians the impression that Russia is getting weak or losing their resolve. Whether or not that is true, time will tell.

I honestly think Mariupol will still be standing even in May. I don’t think Russia has enough fanatical or well-trained legions to breakthrough a defensive line full of industrial buildings and rubble with no retreat available to 2k Ukrainian veterans of urban combat.

The alternative is to pummel the whole complex from the air until nothing is left standing, but these buildings are massive, and even the ones not built to withstand a nuclear blast would still survive a nuclear blast. The amount of ordinance required is not something Russia can afford to expend anymore.

Mariupol will still be holding on in May, unless they decide to gamble that surrendering offers a better outcome. Somehow, I feel like they won’t take that gamble.",1650442437.0,1650442101.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5fuqua,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

 >On 15 April, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) opened a criminal proceeding against ""Igor Strelkov"". He was described as a Russian recruiter and leader of armed ""saboteurs"" and a chief organizer of the ""terror"" in Ukraine's Sloviansk Raion (including an ambush that killed one and wounded three SBU officers), who had coordinated Russian military takeovers of Ukrainian units in Crimea during the 2014 Crimea crisis in March, after having crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border in Simferopol on 26 February. In Crimea, he was reported to be instrumental in negotiating the defection of the Ukrainian Navy commander Denis Berezovsky.

Extract from the Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war:

I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.

You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my long struggle to win peace has failed. Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that I could have done and that would have been more successful. Up to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland. But Hitler would not have it. **He had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened, and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.** **The proposals were never shown to the Poles, nor to us**, and though they were announced in the German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.",False,1650472737.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5hxxvn,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

So anyway, to answer you question i think it's a combo of the sport making money, and their own fan base not wanting them to do it. 

I think it's super short-sighted personally and every bit of support for sanctions matters - any sport/org/company not cooperating is essentially negating some portion of what those companies with higher morals are doing. We have to all work together being part of the overall sanctions to reduce russian quality of life as a result of the blatant evil being perpetrated in their name.

3). Quantities of state-of-the-art, anti ship missiles, that could threaten the Black Sea Fleet, within several hundred KMs of the Ukrainian coast. 

4). Quantities of Switchblade 600 drones, that can be used to target important, expensive and rare Russian vehicles and command posts.

I think shells are significantly harder to intercept with the tech both sides have right now (or, setting that parameter to 0 on both sides, at least that both sides have comparable accuracy?) 
  
Either way, interesting read. I'm dubbing a new combat model for this exact situation: the Big Fukk  
  
E: now that I think of it, this *does* fit the SCM if you can make an assumption:  
That the accuracy of dumb munitions can be modeled as a decrease in firepower   
  
--------  
  
Link if anyone wants to follow along on this nerdshit   
  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvo_combat_model  
  
Here goes:  
  
Let symbol A represent the number of combat units (warships or other weapon platforms) in the Red force at the beginning of the battle. Each one has offensive firepower α, which is the number of offensive missiles **accurately** fired per salvo at the enemy. Each one also has defensive firepower y, which is the number of incoming enemy missiles intercepted per salvo by its active defenses. Each ship has staying power w, which is the number of enemy missile hits required to put it out of action. Equivalently, one could say that each attacking missile can cause damage equal to a fraction u=1/w of a Red ship.

The Blue force is represented in a similar manner. Blue has B units, each with offensive firepower β, defensive firepower z, and staying power x. Each missile that hits will cause damage v=1/x.

The salvo combat model calculates the number of ships lost on each side using the following pair of equations. Here, ΔA represents the change in the number of Red's ships from one salvo, while ΔB represents the change in the number of Blue ships.

ΔA = -(βB - yA)u, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔA ≤ A  
ΔB = -(αA - zB)v, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔB ≤ B  
  
Now we know that shells aren't likely to be intercepted, so both y and z must be 0.  
This just simplifies to  
  
ΔA = -βBu, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔA ≤ A  
ΔB = -αAv, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔB ≤ B  
  
And given that side A uses smart munitions and side B uses dumb munitions, α > β  
  
The wiki page gives a very easy hand-wavy answer for α / β:  
  
>Despite guided weapons generally being used on more difficult targets, they were still 35 times more likely to destroy their targets per weapon dropped.[2]  
  
So α / β ~= 35.   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision-guided_munition
  
Equation becomes  
  
ΔA = -αBu / 35, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔA ≤ A  
ΔB = -αAv, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔB ≤ B,  
  
Remembering that A is Ukraine and B is Russia  
  
Assuming no direct hit is survivable (unlike a ship's case), we can set u and v both to 1. Finally,  
  
ΔA = -αB / 35, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔA ≤ A  
ΔB = -αA, subject to 0 ≤ -ΔB ≤ B,   
  
We then see that every UA howitzer using smart ammunition exclusively is worth 35 RF howitzers using dumb ammunition exclusively, and in hindsight it's not very surprising to find that 35x factor falling right out onto our laps again",1650435775.0,1650431762.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5g14v8,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Example: Russia built the Mig-25 to be a fast interceptor vs American nuclear bombers. They claimed absurd statistics re speed, range and armament which they couldn't actually afford to meet. US military command panicked and convinced Congress to spend billions countering the purported Russian super jet.

That American project was the F-15, a multirole fighter jet capable of rapidly establishing air superiority and then exploiting it immediately to attack strategically important ground and air targets while purpose built bombers and transport aircraft continued operating in hostile airspace without difficulty. It is still the premier American fighter aircraft used today and has *never* been destroyed in an air to air engagement.

A Russian pilot defected and flew a Mig-25 to Japan where he surrendered it to American forces.

Scholz says they are providing Ukraine with money so that they can buy whatever they need from German arms suppliers. This would effectively offload the responsibility from donating inventory of the German Army to supplying the arms from private industry instead.

What is the downside to this? Ukraine needs weapons in combat-ready condition, and they need them now. With the exception of a few tanks here and there, industry simply cannot supply those tanks now, when they are most needed.

So why does Scholz not want to deliver tanks from Germany's army inventory? He names 3 reasons. Firstly he says that Germany is already struggling to meet its NATO obligations and would be unable to do so altogether if they gave away the bulk of their combat-ready tanks. Reason 2 he gives is that the tanks require months of training both to operate and maintain/repair them, so even if they were delivered tomorrow, they would be useless. The Ukrainian government counters that if they had agreed to provide training from the start, they would be trained by now, and each day they use this argument kind of further invalidates that argument. Reason 3 is that Scholz is worried that this would be seen as an escalation by Russia, and they would retaliate by declaring war on Nato or cutting off energy supply to Europe, effectively causing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic damages and a sharp recession.

What arguments speak for the delivery of heavy weapons? Here, the green party and free democrats, both members of the government coalition say that if Russia loses this war here, he cannot attack any other country off the back of this conflict, and that human rights and peace are things that are worth fighting for and that Ukraine has a right to fight for their own peace, and that it's the only moral thing to give them all the tools needed to do exactly that.

As you can see, it's a hot debate even in the German government, and far from ""Germany only wants to suck Putin's cock and they don't give a shit about children being bombed"", which is what you get to read all day if you are reading this thread.",False,1650455637.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5gv92c,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

There is good reason for the west to announce some stuff, but hide others. Announcing stuff on the news is good on for a national level, it makes politicians look like they're doing something.

That said - you say Norway and Russia are buddy-buddy too. Yeah, but you are, well, small, compared to Germany, population-wise, at least. And you are not leading the EU/Europe, you don't presume to. But Germany does and has presumed to as well, so it is naturally that people expect decisive action from their leading countries. 

Second - maybe there has been more bandwagoning now, but CEE countries have known for literal YEARS that when it comes to Russia's aggression, we cannot really rely on Germany. If it hasn't been a knowledge in certain, then at least it has been a deep fear that Germany will not have our backs. Current indecisiveness is fuelling those fears pretty heavily and CEE countries are very frustrated with Germany because of it. Especially because when WE said that Russia is a problem and Russia is dangerous and Russia isn't  being our friend, then Germany alongside with some other W-European countries told us - and not always in so nice tones either - to shut up, sit in the corner, and pay attention to ""how real diplomacy works"". I think what you're seeing now is some overboiling of emotions and feelings because this war has lasted for nearly two months now and somehow, either due to bad PR or bad communication or just bad-whatever, it is countries like Estonia and Lithuania and Poland and Czechia that are standing against Russia very strongly. 

You cannot imagine how many times I've read here and on SM justification how traumatised Germany is from WWII and Red Army actions and how their history cripples their actions now. 

Do you know what we here are talking about though? We here talk about bomb shelters, about where to go if the Russians come in, about what stuff to take and how to use toilet when you don't have water (with a bucket, plastic bag and sawdust, btw). We talk about what we will have to leave behind and whether we could take a ship across the sea to Sweden, because more than likely the Suwalki gap would be closed for us. And we talk about how we're afraid that Russia will come after us too. 

We help Ukraine with whatever we can because we have NO other choice. We're right here, next to Russia too - far closer to Russia, actually, than Germany is or Norway is (I know you share the border and all, but in reality and knowing your defensive capabilities, I think Norway is pretty safe compared to us - you weren't part of the USSR so you have no ""historical reasons"" as to why Russia would want to attack you).

Everybody or very large chunk of people at least and their dog knows that Germany is pro-business and pro-money and that Germany does not want to rock the boat.

Because A: US is big, bad and strong, and B: because CEE countries have never believed that Germany would come to our aid and protection against Russia if it were necessary.

ed069749f9bc3eb6172a3a2f0149dabd,u7nss2,i5gdcxm,"Ukrainian soldiers could always retreat before they all ended up in the same sea. As for the Russians, it would’ve been a lot more terrifying to be advancing in an urban environment that you know that the defenders are able to use every advantageous angle.

We will likely never know the Russian losses up until now.

However, the Azovstal “plant” is huge, and it is not just one building. These facilities are above ground and below ground. Multiple levels of nothing but steel and concrete.

If the residential areas of the city were hard for the invaders to push through, the industrial area will be doubly harder still.

Now that the Ukrainians have less areas to retreat into, the battles will become more pitched. The remaining fights will not unfold like how the fights have played out anywhere else in the Mariupol, other Ukrainian towns, and countryside… Those fights get determined at a distance. Well, the Mariupol fights up until now were probably still pretty intense in comparison to anything else going on in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the fights to come in the Azovstal “plant” will be determined in real close combat.

If there is anything close to 2k Ukrainian soldiers remaining then they’ll hold out for weeks more still, unless Russia scores some devastating hits from the air. Russian infantry is not going to run suicidally into heavily defended buildings full of Ukrainians that have no where to retreat. If they did the Ukrainians won’t even need rubble to use as barricades and obstacles, but rather bodies.

Also that is why you likely won’t see as much armour being used in Mariupol anymore. The more they blast industrial buildings, the more impassable the defensive lines become for the invaders.

With the eastern Donbas region becoming the focus of the next offensive, and with resources already leaving Mariupol and heading north, I really do think Ukraine holds on even into May. 

Mass casualty events in a small area almost never happens and I don’t think it has happened yet this war. All defeats this far usually end in retreat from the strategic objective or mass surrenders of no more than a hundred or so. The stomach to grind through thousands of defenders in close urban combat just isn’t there for the Russians. They needed far more better trained soldiers, less rubble to work through that they themselves created, less frightening propaganda about Nazis that have discouraged Ukrainians from surrendering, and less frightening daily ultimatums about surrendering by a date or they will be killed which would suggest to the Ukrainians that the Russians are sadists who will kill surrendering soldiers just because they didn’t meet a timeline.",1650440849.0,1650440170.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5fvf1z,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Not an expert, but there probably isn't a single overarching reason. Sometimes it will be panic and bad training, other times they might have assumed they are coming right back for it with an ARV. And in many cases, they probably didn't have radios anyway.

https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/feeding-the-bear-a-closer-look-at-russian-army-logistics/

Certainly wartime consumption of ammunition is astronomical. With the constraints on their industrial capacity from sanctions, Russia’s ability to keep up with expenditure is going to be limited. There are a number of sources about Russian artillery, but I don’t know if anyone has a handle on how many shells per gun they have. I think we can assume that after two months of war, Russia has depleted their ready supply of ammunition and are now relying on their stored stocks which may not be as effective (more duds, etc).

>How complicated are missile systems?

It's a great question and shows you are thinking critically. And like all good questions, the answer is: it depends.

You are correct to assume that different categories of equipment will be handled differently. I'll add that there are also different categories of soldier.

A non-standard rifle with no spare parts probably won't make its way to the front lines. It will be given to someone who needs *a gun* but not necessarily *a good, reliable, gun*. Figure a border guard in a non-threatened area, or a police unit behind the lines. This can scale up too; you wouldn't want to take a German Leopard 1 into a fair fight with the latest T-80 or T-72 upgrade package, but they would be plenty good enough for all sorts of other jobs where any tank will do.

>But how easy is it to fire up a Norwegian Mistral SAM launcher? How do you integrate it into your system to avoid friendly fire? Can it integrate with the Brits' Starstreak? Might it shoot down your shiny new Reaper drone by mistake?

This is where bigger picture planning comes into play. Starstreak, Mistral, Strella, Stinger, etc are all pretty short range, low altitude systems. So generally you'd put them where you aren't flying low altitude missions, but where the enemy is. And it is the fear of these systems that also keeps the Russians from flying low altitude missions. Russia just knowing that there are MANPADS on the ground will limit their air force just as surely as losing a planes.

>It's great that so many people are donating gear, but I worry that some of it is not going to be at all useful without a network to integrate into and skilled operators.

That's why donations of so many of the more complicated things, like long range SAMs that need to integrate with RADAR systems, fighters, etc are all items close to what Ukraine already has. There is also the now challenged assumption that this war will be over soon.

I may have misunderstood your post, if so, sorry. But the way it reads - stop it.

It doesn't work like in the movies or games.

This is real.

And real armies require supply, command, control, comms, intel, tactics and coordination to name a few (there are countless things that make a military work).

Russia has very few of these, and those it does are used ineptly.

You don't win wars with numbers, you win it by a concentration of effects for a purpose. Russia has been really bad at this, except in the 'destroy civilians and civilian buildings' context.

Go look up Rasputitsa.

Look back at how the war functioned in the north for last 3 weeks before they pulled out.

Look up Russian logistics.

Pouring more troops into a smaller area strains logistics further, something Russia has been shit at.

Ukraine is very much in this to win, it's a very time-consuming endeavour but there is no magical point where Putin wins. Both sides lost the moment he invaded, but Ukraine will most likely win the war eventually, grinding Russian troops anytime in the next 6 weeks is another critical military error by Russia if they do it.",1650451213.0,1650448384.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5gm4ey,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

""The Bundeswehr has supplied everything it can spare,"" says government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit. Therefore, he says, other avenues must be explored, such as financing purchases from the arms industry. Hebestreit points to talks with Ukraine and industry about what should and can be supplied. Hebestreit also rejected the accusation that Germany is putting the brakes on arms deliveries to Ukraine. There is no delay in arms deliveries from the German side, the government spokesman said.

> German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock described German deliveries of armored vehicles to Ukraine as possible in principle. This is ""not taboo,"" Baerbock said during a visit to the Latvian capital Riga. In the short term, however, the Bundeswehr would not be in a position to provide further equipment of this kind.

> Baerbock answered questions from the press at a press conference in Riga. Berlin, she said, has chosen not to make public all the weapons it has delivered in support of Ukraine: ""We have delivered anti-tank missiles, Stingers and other things that we never talked about publicly, so those deliveries could be made quickly.""

> Asked whether Germany would send its Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery system, which some experts believe Ukraine needs to counterattack Russian forces in the Donbass region, she said Germany would train Kiev's soldiers in the use and maintenance of more advanced systems that the country could obtain from other allied countries or buy directly.

> Baerbock said, ""If partners supply artillery that we can no longer supply, we will help with training and maintenance.""

> She added that Germany will also help Ukraine militarily in the medium and long term in its defensive struggle against Russia. After all, it's not just about acute needs, he said: ""It's also about the next three months and also the next three years. And here Germany will be able to contribute more.""

From reports that were gathered by various intel organizations from sources within Russia earlier in the war, Putin had demanded victory in Ukraine by May 9th from his generals & ministers, after the initial failure to capture significant targets such as Kharkiv & Kyiv. 

Now as the date of May 9th approaches, people are wondering how the Russian decision-making process will be affected by this ""deadline"". There are indications that the reason Russia launched their offensive in the Donbas so early instead of actually taking the time to regroup and rebuild the forces that they've pulled from other fronts into effective battalions, is because their decision was made based on the approaching ""deadline"" rather than the intelligent thing to do for an offensive, which required patience. This indicates desperation from their side.

As to what will actually happen on May 9th, I'm sure Putin and his cronies will declare some sort of ""victory"" in Ukraine- there are indications that this ""victory"" could be a false referendum they intend to hold in Kherson, so as to claim it as Russian territory. But on the other hand, the costs of this war are becoming more and more apparent in Russia, despite Russia's best efforts to keep information about the true scale of Russian loss suppressed. The sinking of *Moskva* is a big deal in that regard since it's a big enough loss that Russia couldn't deny that loss and is also unable to deny that there were conscripts on that ship that were sent to die in a warzone, despite earlier promises that no conscripts would join the war.  So a failure to announce a significant victory on May 9th could spell a huge fall in public support for the war in Russia. 

This is, of course, all speculation, but it's the reason that so many, including myself, are anxious to see what will happen on May 9th and the weeks surrounding it.",False,1650477196.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5ia82e,,1,6,0,6,1,0,

But whether Russia can maintain control of the territory it conquers, especially if sanctions continue to bite and Ukraine continues to receive new weapons seems very unlikely.

And of course, while I am certain UA will not simply sign over the Donbas, there is a possibility that a freezing of the conflict might be acceptable to Kyiv if Russia withdraws to the pre-war lines of control.

Originally they were so inaccurate there was a need for several to be pointed at a target with the view that multiple strikes would destroy it. The primary targets were missile silos which were small and underground. Long story short nukes today are smaller, ground penetrating to around 100 feet and highly accurate so only one is needed per target. Nuclear capable submarines and mobile ICBM launchers add a layer of complexity but, as far as Russian subs are concerned, their precise position is probably well known to those who are interested and satellites have a good idea of what is on the ground. Hypersonic delivery will change the game but as yet that is still just a concept.

Primary targets would be military and industrial. The concept of mass destruction of civilian targets is probably still top of mind for the Russians but anti missile systems could well render that approach less effective than intended.

As a Georgian, this has always been my goal for Georgia. If we make Georgia a great place to live with prosperity and a high standard of living, those break-away regions would want to naturally ""rejoin"" the rest of the nation. I have seen it happen with the Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus, and the disparity between living standards between Northern Cyprus and Southern Cyprus is not as stark as the difference between the Russian-controlled regions of Georgia and the rest of the country. Georgia joining the EU would accelerate things IMO. 

Not well known outside of the country but Georgia offers a lot of benefits to the people that live in the Russian occupied regions, such as free healthcare in Georgian hospitals as the care in the occupied hospitals is often poor. 

The only hangup is I can see Turkey letting Northern Cyprus rejoin with the South with EU pressure, but I can't see the Russians willingly leaving occupied regions of Georgia if the local populace wants that.",1650485237.0,1650484596.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5iqssf,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

Every destructive measure taken to destroy their banking system is numerous Russians losing their retirement savings. Every dollar we strip out of their energy industry is one less dollar they have for public funding to pay for their medical system, education system and social systems. Every arms contract that is broken weakens their military and ability to advance in the future, and increases the likelihood of more events like the Kursk happening. Every dollar stripped from their tech start ups ensures that their technology gets left behind and their people fail to advance at the same pace as the rest of the world.

If they do, oh well. Every Russian airplane that is banned from entering foreign airspace and parts manufacturer that refuses to send parts to Russia, assures the destruction of their airline industry, causing thousands of more jobs to be lost, and Russians to be, permanently, separated from their families in other parts of the world.

When America invaded Iraq or nato Afghanistan they had drones and they were monitoring the situation on the ground constantly, aerial photography was happening yes but in long term planning not short term.

This drone is useless to the boots on the ground and might as well be shoved off into ditches as dead weight by the Russian servicemen as its probably more counter productive then useful.

It would be okay maybe if you were fighting a third world country with no industrial military logistics like South Africa or Brazil where slower reactions will happen but against a western nation or a modern weapons making hub like Ukraine or a neighbor to turkey like Ukraine you might as well be sending jets into the air with cameras on their bottoms instead, they fly further, they are more likely to come home again, they can Carry better camera equipment, and you can probably gather intelligence for longer and more extensively as a result.

2158703ff3f39a8268473cdddb1b04ae,u7nss2,i5h121x,"TL;DR for some of the  questions in the article:  
**What did the chancellor promise Ukraine?**  
He promised to finance arms supplies provided directly by the german arms industry. Ukraine selected items from a provided list and Germany financed those. Items included anti-tank/air weapons, ammunition (apparently which also can be used in artillery - not very clear on that)

**What are the future plans of the federal government?**  
NATO members which provide soviet weapons to Ukraine are set to receive replacements from Germany. Providing combat ready soviet weapons is of upmost importance since they can be used immediatly.

**Are shipments of more heavy weapons supported?**  
Scholz is hinting at a participation in the shipment of artillery from USA and Netherlands. Both are already commited to sending those.

**Are there any shipments of weapons directly from the arsenal of the german armed forces?**  
Barely any. ""We have to acknowledge that we are hitting some limits here"" says Scholz on the background that they need those weapons themself to protect their own and ally (NATO, EU) countries. Marder, Howitzer and heavy artillery are needed to sustain and train their own forces, says Vice Inspector General Markus Laubenthal. There is also the question of training in the tanks of type Marder, which need to be operated/maintained and training can take multiple weeks.

**Are ukraine armed forces able to operate Leopard- and Marder tanks?**  
The opinions differe here. Germany is referring to the extensive training needed, but Ukraine would rather start the training sooner than later and say that their personal can quickly learn those systems. Still unclear would be the availability of spare parts and maintanence.

**What are the arguments against giving heavy weapons?**  
Once of the most heavily weighted argument is the fact that Germany and NATO could be considered parties of this war, which could lead to nuclear escalation. Scholz used this reasoning multiple times to stress that they only would send weapons, which would not require any German soldies in Ukraine.

**What are the arguments fro giving heavy weapons?**  
There are warnings that if/when Putin wins against Ukraine, he could attack other neighbouring countries, including NATO countries. This means that Ukraine is not only fighting for their own independence, but also for those of other countries.

**What has Germany delivered until now?**  
Germany is no longer discussing their shipments publicly. Even high ranking politicians need to query the Secret Protection Agency and can not talk about their information publicly. We only know what was publicly disclosed at the start of the war: Anti-Air/Anti-Tank weapons, automatic weapons, bullet proof vests/helmets, night vision devices and armored vehicels. The value of shipments until end of march was 186 Million Euro.  


**Who is deciding weapon exports?**  
Not the chancellor alone. Requests for exports are decided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action together with the Ministry of foreign affairs and Ministry of defence. In the end they need to be approved by the federal government. Other armaments are decided by the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control.

One of the ""advantages"" from a NATO perspective to this conflict, is that it's providing a lot of ability to clear out Soviet inventories from a lot of nations, to replace them with NATO compatible systems.

One of the open secrets about the conflict is that NATO nations are running their AWACS 24/7 and feeding the intel to Ukraine just as fast as it can get sanitized and sent over. The reason this is a big advantage is that it means they don't have to keep their SAM radars on (which lets Russia know where they are). They just wait till they know a plane is already in their killzone then turn the system on, 5-10 seconds later a missile's on its way after the lock is established. Shortly after the radar's already folding back up and moving somewhere else to prevent counter-fire.

If those systems were Patriot or other various NATO models, it would have a datalink called ""Link 16"".

Putin: Life will change for the worse:

President Vladimir Putin has asserted that Russia will fail in its military objectives in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine that had it been successful would have, he says, forced people to adhere to  Russian norms.

Speaking at a meeting in the Kremlin aimed at explaining Russia as a land of despair and disfunction, Putin said Moscow had chosen to start a “military operation” in Ukraine because of “the clear threat” to the Kremlin Mafiacracy a prosperous and Western-oriented Ukraine would pose as an example to the Russian public.

“I said it at the very beginning - the purpose of this operation is to destroy any positive alternatives our people might see to the current authoritarian regime we have instituted,” he said.

Addressing a girl who joined the meeting from Sevastopol in Crimea, which Russia forcibly occupied in 2014, he said: “We will act consistently to grind out any hope of liberty, prosperity, and a fulfilling life across any territory we control, including any vassal states whose rulers we can co-opt or threaten - just like it happened to you, in your life, in Sevastopol.”

A cargo of 2,750 tonnes of the substance (equivalent to around 1. 1 kilotons of TNT) had been stored in a warehouse without proper safety measures for the previous six years after having been confiscated by the Lebanese authorities from the abandoned ship MV Rhosus. The explosion was preceded by a fire in the same warehouse, but as of September 2021, the exact cause of the detonation is still under investigation.

Religion - they're mostly Muslim, definitely not the favorite religion of the West and vice versa.

Location - Chechnya is not an easy country to get to for the West, and Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan are the closest regional allies of the West, none of which are closely tied to NATO with the exception of Turkey who is in NATO but under Erdogan relationships have been strained, it's been pretty surprising how much Turkey has shown up already for Ukraine as it's been looking like they were becoming Russian allies. Also Armenia is firmly in Russia's pocket rn as Russia just helped them fight off both Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Population - Ukraine has 40+ million people, Chechnya only 1+ million people, population and technological and manufacturing capacity are hugely important in a war, especially when Russia has 144+ million people and we used to think they had a strong technological and manufacturing base but that's looking suspect now. However Ukraine does have a strong technological and manufacturing base.

I'm sorry to say but the Chechens didn't have a chance against big bully Russia, but it would have definitely helped if we sanctioned the shit out of Russia for what they did in Chechnya, and would have probably prevented the Ukrainian invasion, but the past is the past, we have to learn from it's mistakes but we can't go back to fix them.",1650468993.0,1650466090.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5g7ull,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

I believe that they are attempting a push to encircle the Ukrainians in the donbas but that so far they've gained basically a road junctions worth of ground, maybe 9km of the 90 or so they need too and ground that is not a good sign, at this rate it will be weeks to encircle anything as their attempts stutter cough and die as very rarely after the first day does progress magically get faster. This is not the battle for Iraq, and they are not America's armored fist trying to strike across the deserts at light speed.

Meanwhile on the Ukrainian side of things, Ukrainians are reportedly nearing the outskirts of the city of donbass itself and if they take it then it is very likely the donbas militias will capitulate there and then leaving whatever refuses to flee into luhansk and could do this in the next 3 to 4 days if their planning goes well having come within eyeshot of the welcome to donbas signs.

If that happens, if the donbas militias surrender then russias military might would be functionally cut in half geographically and the northern front will become the only thing of value to Russia anymore worth a damn, the fighting for moltiopel and mariupol will have been for little more then some bombed out ruins, and backwater villages, and the relatively fresh forces to the south guardian Crimea will fall back to Crimea proper as Russia realizes its holding on to rubble and worthless ground. The one saving grace is to Russias occupation of the south would then be that they own the sea of azov that would really be all that would be of tactical value to holding this territory.

The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful conventional artillery systems deployed in the 2010s. **It is capable of a very high rate of fire; in burst mode it can fire three rounds in nine seconds, ten rounds in 56 seconds, and can—depending on barrel heating—fire between 10 and 13 rounds per minute continuously. The PzH 2000 has automatic support for up to 5 rounds of Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact (MRSI). The replenishment of shells is automated.** Two operators can load 60 shells and propelling charges in less than 12 minutes.

 >Skjold-class corvettes (skjold means ""shield"" in Norwegian) are a class of six light, superfast, stealth missile corvettes in service with the Royal Norwegian Navy. The boats were formerly classed as MTBs (motor torpedo boats) but, from 2009, the Royal Norwegian Navy has described them as corvettes (korvett) because their seaworthiness is seen as comparable to corvettes, and because they do not carry torpedoes. They were built at the Umoe Mandal yard. With a maximum speed of 60 knots (110 km/h), the Skjold-class corvettes were the fastest combat ships afloat at the time of their introduction.

Resources.

Manpower

Competence

This will certainly go on longer than many think, believe or hope.

But by very many metrics, Russia is doomed.  They have proven that theirs is a culture of fraud, incompetence and arrogance that prevents them from learning even the most basic of realities.  We see this time and time again where they make the same basic mistakes over and over and over.  They don't learn.  They seem utterly incapable of learning.  It's tragic.

In contrast, Ukraine has been trained by the world's best for years now and are getting more and more of this.  Add to this the very current and active battle experience they're getting and we can see plenty of reasons to be certain of their eventual victory.

But the more profound issue is resources and related competencies there.  Ukraine is being handed all they need and this will continue *infinitely*.  NATO and aligned countries could devote a sum larger than the **entire GDP** of Russia and they wouldn't even break a sweat doing so.  Russia *cannot* afford this war.  They could not afford it before.  They certainly cannot when the West has set in motion the destruction of their economy.

Finally, although the death toll and other sufferings of Ukraine will be severe and lamentable, Russia is again dooming themselves by so eagerly destroying their youth.  This will play out over a longer period of time than even the slow collapse of their society due to the tech and economic sanctions.

Big differences. We're arming Ukraine now. Poland in 1939 got virtually nothing. There's a reason for that.

What we're providing is technologically superior to the Russian equipment. Anything that the rest of Europe could have given Poland in 1939 would have been completely outclassed by the Nazi war machine. They were flying cutting edge aircraft and using state of the art tanks. Even Britain, arguably the most technologically advanced European military opposing Germany, with the newly introduced Spitfire was phasing out Hawker Furies and still flying Gloster Gladiators. 

If we'd sent Poland aid, it would not have been Spits as we barely had enough for ourselves. It would have been the just-retired Furies or the Bristol Bulldogs that had been retired from fighter service in 1937 but were still being maintained as advanced trainers.

Now, the problem for Russia is that one of their stated goals is the destruction of Azov, so letting them go goes against their political goals. Another situation where political objectives are outweighing the strategic ones. So Russia is in a bind. Bummer for them.

- The priority now is to send equipment that can be used immediately, and that is what the allies agree on. When countries send equipment that can be used by Ukraine quickly (like Warsaw Pact equipment), Germany will help them backfill.
Stuff that the German defense industry can deliver quickly has been put on a list, and can be ordered by Ukraine; Germany pays (they approved 1 billion € for that).
- When he was asked if there were ""red lines"" for German weapons deliveries to Ukraine in the context of artillery / heavy weapons, he said they can be delivered in the long run, but it will take some time if they have to be produced first.

I guess you do have some examples besides ""no gas embargo suicide"" or claims by shit sources like visegrad24? 

> they're preventing other countries to donate their German made weapons

Such as? There were some artillery pieces from estonia which were not allowed to be exported *before* the war, there has not been any kind of blockade after the 24th and any request from these countries is swiftly approved unlike what you are claiming here. 

> and they're still paying 100B+€ for Russian gas

Weird, the rest of europe is doing the same. Guess they dont like economical suicide either. Unlike you suddenly discover large gas sources with existing infrastructure to extract it somewhere in europe you won't have a solution for the dependency either. Which, again, also affects the majority of other european countries which arent able to flip some magical switch either.

> All to keep their economy going while Europe burns around them

Guess what - germany just like the rest of the EU is in for the long haul. The economy you are talking about is supporting the rest of europe, is funding weapons, is funding humanitarian aid and will be funding the rebuilding of ukraine. ""The economy"" is also all the stuff you can buy in stores and i'm talking about the very basic necessities.

I think what happened is one or two Migs were in charge of low level air to air combat and they shot down a number of Ka-52s and Mi-8s trying to secure the airport.  One of the first videos of the war that went viral was a Ka-52 getting smoked by a smokeless missile around that area. 

To the defenders on the ground, these Migs probably attacked out of nowhere, destroyed a helicopter and then vanished.  And Hostomel was a desperate battle with the whole country on the line, ground troops probably saw them as ghostly saviors, which they were. 

It probably wasn't technically hard flying, shooting down helicopters from the 60's, but it was incredibly important. And, technically, there were much more than 5 air to air kills, which is where the ace designation comes from.

(Also, an army gives some influence and many still are afraid of a powerful Germany. They have an economy and shouldn‘t have military power too.)

As for Western Germany, during all that time after WWII there was a culture being built that is very anti-militaristic. Hence, nobody rhere wanted to truly invest in an army or arms. There is an Antikriegsbewegung there as a backlash of WWII that is especially strong within the left that just rather rolls over than fight back. 

That was ingrained for quite some time. It‘s not (just) sympathy for Russia that many on the left show when being a tad reluctant in delivering arms, it‘s indeed also the belief that „problems can‘t ever be solved by arms“.

Armchair politicians on Reddit often miss to take into account that cultural differences are real and not something that changes overnight.

Germany is shifting though, just not fast enough, because for Germany it is a huge shift.

1) Is Germany at fault for the energy dependency they have gotten themselves into? Yes, and they deserve to be criticized for it.

2) Is Germany responsible for the sorry state of its military and its resulting lack of serious commitments to NATO partners and now to Ukraine? Yes, but they are not the only ones to blame - Germany arming itself again is exactly the kind of thing that for example the polish government would have criticized Germany for up until literally 2 months ago, and Germany's strong economy is in part a result of them investing into industry rather than a large military in an interdependent world where the kind of war that Russia started would be a fucking terrible idea (an assumption that turned out to be right, unfortunately because Putin was dumb enough to actually do it)

3) is Germany at fault for substituting foreign policy and geostrategy with economic projects such as the ill-fated North Stream 2 pipeline? Yes, and those people who have pushed for the pipeline should resign and be called out.

4) Is Germany a country of pussies that doesn't give a shit about children being bombed and genocide taking place, and all they wanna do is suck Putin's cock and stuff their pockets with blood money? Come the fuck on.

5) should Germany just pull the plug on Russian energy and take economic losses in the ball park of 250 billion dollars just to save face? I don't know, but I think Germany is going to be much more valuable to Ukraine in the long run if they don have to first dig themselves out of their own recession before they can help Ukraine rebuild.

She, of course, meant that if they come, then Europe will have to deal with them, but what was constructed out of it was that Germany and Merkel will accept everybody, as long as they manage to get to Europe. 

Germany accepted 1,5M refugees, because for example in Estonia - even though we grumbled and what-not - even though we accepted our agreed share and gave them free living places, free healthcare, free education and language classes, support people and monthly income the same as any other Estonian would get, most of our refugees left for Germany. Why? Because we weren't Germany and they ""knew"" that in Germany the would get a free house, benefits and everything else + have people from their own society nearby, so they didn't want to stay here. They even asked us why were they being forced to come and stay in Estonia, when they didn't want to and at the same time, their friends or other family members ""won the jackpot"" and got to go to Germany, and they told us that they felt they were being punished, because Germany had invited them.

\- Yes our defense industry send Scholz a list of all available weapons (this includes weapons that needed to be repaired or to be overhauled to be actively being used which could take up to 3-4 months)

\- He doesn't need to share this list, as our Minister of Defense already shared a list including a lot of this weapons with the Ukraine.

\- There are no more weapons left in Germany to give to Ukraine, which is mostly right, if Germany would lease any more weapons it would be actively used equipment from the Bundeswehr which would lead to a state in which the Bundeswehr couldn't do its main job: ""National Defense"" and would also break multiple NATO Threshholds. The depots are empty as most of the old stuff was either sold to other european states or was bought back by the defense industry to rehaul them and sell them afterwards.

\- So point 5 is also right.

\- Point 7 also partly right as German / NATO weapon systems are totally different from old Sovjet equipment that is being used in the Ukraine. And yes while Javlins are also not being Sovjet equipment it is multiple times easier to adjust to it compare to an Marder tank. 2-3 weeks named in point 8 is somewhat right but not totally proven yet Ukraine always states they need it now so 2-3 weeks aren't essentially what you wanna ""lose"" just to master a weapon that you may get 2-3 weeks after that.

\-Point 11: Don't know maybe Scholz simply has another definition of heavy weapons.

\- Point 13/14: Never saw a actual source for that. Yes he can veto / delay items to buy but this isn't something new and was also done in the beginning which can be criticized

\- Point 17: The ambassador in Germany also isn't known to always say the truth so everything should be taken with a bit of caution.

In the end, yes some points are valid but most of them are simply catchy headlines to spread resentment about the Germans. Scholz surely doesn't made a good figure and gets rightly criticized for it, but saying he works for the russians is malicious imputation.

From CEE perspective, here's how I see Germany in the middle of this. I think Germany has a rotten position, a little bit, because for decades post-WWII, it has been told to only engage in world affairs in peace and economy. The whole society has been raised up to believe that everything can be solved via talks and economic cooperation. The German youth until now, I guess, pretty much thought that an army as such is pointless, because there are no longer threats such as WWII happening to us (told to me by several german younger people themselves over the years). 

I also think that Germany is super slow to change and it prefers to basically wait and watch until the last minute to ensure that what it will do isn't wrong. Hence why it has waited so long - Germany is cautious and prefers not to rock the boat, which unfortunately also means that... well, if they thought that Ukraine would fall (which I'm sure many countries did in reality) quickly, they'd rather deal with Russia and the ensuing new puppet government than actually help prop up Ukraine and help it fight. 

With all of that said - you'd be hard to find a person in here who wouldn't say that Germany's main position is money and economics and if that means Ukraine has to be sacrificed, so be it. And this isn't a new opinion, this isn't something that has developed in the last few weeks - people have known this to be ""true"" for years, even decades. People here think that Germany will not put their neck out if they really aren't forced to and since... well, Central and Eastern Europe are seen as kind of a backwater (great for cheap economical labour and producing stuff though), it's kind of totally fine? if we kind of fall into the wrong hands. You can find plenty of people, who are pro-EU, pro-Europe, anti-extremism, who also believe that if Germany would've been put to choose between Eastern Europe and Russia, it would choose Russia. 

And that's part of the issue why you see anti-German sentiment. It isn't that people have developed this now (ofc, reddit is different, since it has people from all over the world), it's that they've always suspected deep inside that we don't matter in the grand scale, that we will just be sold to another bidder if that fits the larger economies and powers, and seeing this happen to Ukraine has brought back lots of bad memories to lots of people and reinforced the internal fears that Germany would do anything not to rock the boat, including collude with Russia. 

Perceptions and opinions matter, even if we don't want them to. Here it has been always known that we have a hard time convincing anybody in Germany or in italy or in France that Russia is a threat. That if we try to do it, then we are belittled and told to shut up, because our thoughts and opinions would endanger business and money flows with Russia. There's a lot resentment underneath, because when CEE countries told Germany (and others) that this is going to be a problem, we were told to essentially shut up, sit in the corner and let the big kids do the talking as we knew shit, in their opinion. And now it turns out that actually, we have been right all along and Germany has been pulled on a string, right into Russia's web of lies and deceit and Germany has cornered itself into a weakened position. Of course, CEE countries are not blameless either - we have bought Russian gas and oil too, but if Germany wants to be the de facto leader of EU/Europe (which it is due to its size and economy), it needs to see things not only from its own perspective, but also from others' perspectives and it repeatedly fails to do that. 

Also - I think Germany's PR and communication is extremely bad. It fiff-faffs here and there and comes off shaky and unsure. Germany needs to message strongly how much it has given money and aid, loudly and clearly and everywhere, with concrete stuff that has already been delivered. Yeah, it isn't the best that they have to show it because of OpSec, but right now it's necessary to show that they have actually done what they have said they have done. It looks bad if it looks like Estonia has given 220+ million euros worth of military stuff and aid (not to mention private donations of cars, ambulances, money, humanitarian aid that does not get counted under the official aid), with our own military budget being some 700-800 millions of euros (so essentially we've given Ukraine 1/3 of our own yearly budget worth of stuff), and Germany says that they've given a bit. I know they said they've approved 1B euros, but that is still 4x as Estonia, whereas Estonia is 1,3 million people and Germany is 80 million.

This is indeed true, though not so easy to solve in a short time.

Nobody that understands how modern-day nuclear arsenals work will say with a straight face that their effects are overstated. If you're educated about nuclear weapons, you will conclude quickly that even a small exchange between the US and Russia using 40-year-old tech is not survivable for either country. 

>But I simply refuse to believe that America would let Russia have this kind of power while being relatively unstable for 31 years.

Your fallacy is thinking that America ever had a choice in accepting this. ICBM tech is fairly simple. It's so old because old technology is very effective at mutually assured destruction. America possesses no technology to guarantee interception of all of Russia's nukes because that technology isn't possible to build.

Your thought process essentially boils down ""I don't want to believe anyone could destroy the US with nukes because that would just suck too much for me to believe."" You can't actually point to any evidence supporting what you're saying. I can easily throw a hundred explainer videos form nuclear experts and military analysts at you. All of this evidence will very quickly make clear to anyone that everyone's fucked in the even to a nuclear exchange. Your theory is that all of these videos are lies and America has secretly possessed technology for 30 years that it's kept under wraps with 100% perfection and not one single person ever leaking any information about this to the public.

That would be a dumb thing for them to do.

US hasn't positioned assets for a major nuclear exchange either.

However - a very prompt response could absolutely be wielded by the West, without much in the way of positioning, and the West does have a pretty massive advantage in terms of the size of a response strike.  If Russia isn't prepared in this way, their ability to counterstrike could be burnt-down by a huge chunk. They'd be able to do a few counterstrikes with their sub fleet, and maybe a couple of ICBMs, but they'd be largely de-fanged if the West deployed a mass-strike in response to a small-scale nuclear attack on Ukraine. 

It would actually be the ""best"" scenario - but it's pretty clear by Russia's posture, that they're not going to go this route, because they've got their pants down at this point.

Now: If Russia makes these preparatory moves - Western allies would also respond to scale up the percentage of weapons on-standby.  But the tone of the entire conversation would shift dramatically. Not just the official discussion - but newsmedia would definitely notice, even if government resources GLOMAR this change in status.

The smaller countries only want Germany to lead if they get paid for it, if there is nothing beneficial to them they will disagree. They are true opportunists. Look UK before Brexit, look Poland, Hungary. They were always the major 'more nationalistic'-thinking roadblocks, Anti-EU parties were rising the last decade, especially because of immigration, which is always unpopular in the population. 

It's a blame game which happens since EU added more members, EU law is unattractive in countries who are less developed than Germany/Scandinavia etc., corruption is higher. 

And you cant send what you don't have, USA has mountains of weapon systems rotting around, perk for spending so much. Germany dedicated to invest more but this will take years, Ukraine doesn't have years. They want stuff yesterday. And just today Baerbock said they are sending weapons in secret, its on Reuters.

\- Yes our defense industry send Scholz a list of all available weapons (this includes weapons that needed to be repaired or to be overhauled to be actively being used which could take up to 3-4 months)  
  
\- He doesn't need to share this list, as our Minister of Defense already shared a list including a lot of this weapons with the Ukraine.  
  
\- There are no more weapons left in Germany to give to Ukraine, which is mostly right, if Germany would lease any more weapons it would be actively used equipment from the Bundeswehr which would lead to a state in which the Bundeswehr couldn't do its main job: ""National Defense"" and would also break multiple NATO Threshholds. The depots are empty as most of the old stuff was either sold to other european states or was bought back by the defense industry to rehaul them and sell them afterwards.  
  
\- So point 5 is also right.  
  
\- Point 7 also partly right as German / NATO weapon systems are totally different from old Sovjet equipment that is being used in the Ukraine. And yes while Javlins are also not being Sovjet equipment it is multiple times easier to adjust to it compare to an Marder tank. 2-3 weeks named in point 8 is somewhat right but not totally proven yet Ukraine always states they need it now so 2-3 weeks aren't essentially what you wanna ""lose"" just to master a weapon that you may get 2-3 weeks after that.  
  
\-Point 11: Don't know maybe Scholz simply has another definition of heavy weapons.  
  
\- Point 13/14: Never saw a actual source for that. Yes he can veto / delay items to buy but this isn't something new and was also done in the beginning which can be criticized  
  
\- Point 17: The ambassador in Germany also isn't known to always say the truth so everything should be taken with a bit of caution.  
  
In the end, yes some points are valid but most of them are simply catchy headlines to spread resentment about the Germans.

There are no ""counter observations"". If you have a rebuttal to some criticism someone makes in the comments, address that criticism directly. If you would like to see what is wrong with those talking points, here, I'll indulge you.

a) In order for this to matter, it has to outweigh the things that Germany helps the Russian forces with. It's good that Germany sent helmets and blankets to Ukraine, I'm sure they are grateful for this help. But Germany is decisively helping Putin finance this war. If Germany stopped buying oil from Russia, it would be an enormous blow to Putin's war effort. European countries pay almost a billion euro per day to Putin for oil and gas and a huge part of this payment comes from Germany.

b) This is a red herring. It is simply just a way of deflecting criticism. Public opinion judges countries' position on this war based on the impact it has on the outcome. The fact that Bulgaria sends less money to Ukraine than Germany is of little consequence. The fact that Hungary opposes sanctions on Russia is consequential and you see how this translates in severe criticism of Hungary. The behavior of the United States in this war is exemplary and is in very stark contrast with how Germany approaches it. Baltic countries and other small countries have done more for Ukraine than the richest country in Europe. And more importantly, their position was unwavering from the beginning.

c) Germany is in a unique position to realistically shorten this war. Yet it chooses to not act towards this goal for economic reasons. The fact that Germany is partially responsible for the predicament Ukraine is in right now, makes this even more infuriating. Given these circumstances, it is impossible to escape the feeling that Germany is calculating its potential economic cost to doing the right thing in a time of need while Russia commits genocide in Ukraine.",False,1650438463.0,t3_u7nss2,t1_i5g9khi,,6,0,0,0,0,0,

 >The Sino-Indian War between China and India occurred in October–November 1962. A disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a defensive Forward Policy from 1960 to hinder Chinese military patrols and logistics, in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959.

It comes back to politics and scale, it's very complex but western governments care about Taiwan as 1. they're worried about China's unfettered access to the pacific - Taiwan presents an important strategic location and 2. Taiwans defeat would diminish US political influence with the rise of China and 3. Because of its manufacturing capability - they produce many of the worlds semiconductors, which we are extremely short of; the factories take billions of dollars to make over many years.

Because western governments care, especially the US, and as such may protect Taiwan against China, it becomes a personal worry to people; they might not be geographically close, but the aggressor, China, possesses nuclear weapons which threaten us all no matter where you're located. And such a war would have global impact. We all have a personal stake.

It's a little like North Korea - they don't have an army that can take anyone down, so why do we care so much and constantly hear news about them compared to other countries? Because they possess some means of inflicting an enormous amount of casualties on us which makes them a personal threat.

Or Iraq - same thing, no real threat, other than us being told they have nuclear weapons, this gave people a reason to rally behind the invasion.

You could call it selfish in a way - we care more about what personally threatens our country or way of life. But again, I don't think it's due to race or colour for the majority, just that a lot of these other issues are too far removed.

I try to be careful about the opinions on Reddit and forums or, as you say, the narrow picture the media sometimes shows. You get a certain group of people that post here and it isn't indicitive of life and people in general. Most people would look at a dead child and feel terrible no matter where they came from.

Millions could be killed, but millions are not MAD. The point of that difference is that acting on the political norms that MAD established doesn't benefit the current situation. If believing MAD still applies means that NATO allows hundreds of thousands of people to suffer and die, and millions more to have their country to be swallowed up, to be raped and pillaged by a fascist regime, then those assumptions about Russia are not benign, but incredibly harmful. Understanding that Russia lacks the capability to force a MAD outcome means that you can bring the full might of the NATO alliance down on their army in Ukraine. It reframes their nuclear capability towards that of China, or Pakistan, and not the USSR. It also forces their leadership to consider that Nukes don't give them a free pass anymore. If going nuclear results in their destruction, but not ours, then going nuclear isn't a ""winning"" outcome, it's just a quick path to total defeat/destruction. Russia has chosen the path of war, and conquest, over that of peace, they have placed themselves in history with the empires of Japan, and the Nazis. There is no going back to before, the sooner we realize we now are engaged in a war that must end in regime change, the less damage that conflict will have. We did not get to this point overnight, it may seem like this started on Feb 24th, but this has been festering for decades. The tolerance of Russia's actions, just like the tolerance of Germany's actions in the 30s has put us on the path to war. Russia needed to be dismantled, like Germany was after WWII, instead, it's as if we won the Cold War and just went home without rooting out any of the systems that spawned it in the first place. In some ways the Cold War never ended, it just went sub-zero. And like any ice age, it has now thawed out and gone hot. A return to brinksmanship is not an acceptable outcome now, for NATO or the global community. A two-headed snake of Russia and China will not be allowed to dominate 2/3 of the globe, not without a lot of blood being spilled. The reason the United States is being so cautious is that, inside the military, this is already understood. For decades now the world has grown used to the idea that freedom and liberty are inherent rights, paid for by the blood of our Fathers and Grandfathers.

629bd6ae64321d299109f4fe26a0bcec,u7nss2,i5i0liv,">Well, Cornell explains that even a full scale nuclear exchange between Russia and America would not lead humanity to extinction. Who understands how nuclear weapons work better, you, or Cornell?

Actually Cornell explains that everyone dies:

>The devastation causes so much smoke that only 30-40 percent of sunlight reaches the Earth’s surface for the subsequent six months.

>A massive drop in temperature follows, with the weather staying below freezing throughout the subsequent Northern Hemisphere summer. In Iowa, for example, the model shows temperatures staying below 0°C for 730 days straight. There is no growing season. This is a true nuclear winter.

>Nor is it just a short blip. Temperatures still drop below freezing in summer for several years thereafter, and global precipitation falls by half by years three and four. It takes over a decade for anything like climatic normality to return to the planet.

>**By this time, most of Earth’s human population will be long dead. The world’s food production would crash by more than 90 percent, causing global famine that would kill billions by starvation. In most countries less than a quarter of the population survives by the end of year two in this scenario.** Global fish stocks are decimated and the ozone layer collapses.

>The models are eerily specific. **In the 4,400 warhead/150 Tg soot nuclear war scenario, averaged over the subsequent five years, China sees a reduction in food calories of 97.2 percent, France by 97.5 percent, Russia by 99.7 percent, the UK by 99.5 percent and the US by 98.9 percent. In all these countries, virtually everyone who survived the initial blasts would subsequently starve.**

Literally their only caveat to these predictions is that there would hopefully be enough people left over on Planet Earth to repopulate it over the course of thousands of years later. They compare it to the anology of the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs:

>Even the 150 Tg soot nuclear war scenario is orders of magnitude less than the amount of smoke and other particulates put into the atmosphere by the asteroid that hit the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, killing the dinosaurs and about two-thirds of species alive at the time.

>This implies that some humans would survive, eventually to repopulate the planet, and that a species-level extinction of Homo sapiens is unlikely even after a full-scale nuclear war. **But the vast majority of the human population would suffer extremely unpleasant deaths** from burns, radiation and starvation, **and human civilization would likely collapse entirely. Survivors would eke out a living on a devastated, barren planet**.

I'm sorry, but if your point is that ""some people will survive in caves for hundreds of years,"" you don't substantively disagree with anything I'm saying. That outcome is the same outcome as both countries being completely destroyed.

>You ""want to believe"" in your breathless hyperbole the same way you're accusing op.

If your own source agrees with me that a nuclear exchange between Russia and US is tantamount to the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, then it boggles the mind how you can call the destruction of nuclear weapons ""breathless hyperbole.""

China has 360 major surface ships, while US Navy only has 297. We're **already** outnumbered.

China also is mass-producing more ships than the US Navy, and will soon outnumber us in not only number-of-ships, but also in tonnage.

Even if the USA ramps up Naval spending, China will outnumber us through 2030. It takes a long time to build new ships.

China also has the largest Airforce in the world. If battles occur over Taiwan, that is China's Airforce + Chinese Missile Force + Chinese Navy 3vs1 the US Navy.

US Airforce is big for sure, but a lot of our bases are in Europe, Japan, Philippines.

I said it is not the same outcome you are claiming would occur. You were also not talking about a full scale exchange above, you were talking about ""even a small exchange,"" and claiming its effects on the planet would be even worse than what Cornell explains for a full scale exchange.

I am disagreeing with two things you said:

>even a small exchange between the US and Russia using 40-year-old tech is not survivable for either country

This is wrong. You skipped this in your reply to me for some reason, but as I pointed out, the Cornell analysis explains that neither country would be outright destroyed in a smaller scale exchange. Your claim here is outright hyperbole. I am not saying the actual outcome would be ""acceptable,"" or ""good"", I am saying you are exaggerating the actual outcome. 

>Even if only 10% of them are operational, we don't have the assets to shoot down even most of those. Every American on the continent would die from radiation poisoning within 2-3 months of the bombs going off, and the dust in the air is likely going to be enough to kill all crops on Earth and leave everyone else dead within a matter of years

This is also wrong. 10% of operational bombs with some shot down by defense assets would not be a full scale exchange, and even a full scale exchange does not leave ""everyone else dead."" As cornell explains, a smaller scale exchange would absolutely not kill every American on the continent from radiation poisoning. Even on the high end of their estimates for a limited scale exchange, casualties would be 10-20% of the country's population. The full scale exchange in the cornell analysis serves as an extreme example of the worst case scenario, and it is still not as bad as your claims for a less than worst case scenario.

Germany & Europe who decided to buy Putin's natural gas is another matter; the US is shipping compressed LNG to Asia from Lousiana and other ports as we speak (the prices were negotiated when natty was low and they could get a price when fracking gas was dirt cheap in the US).

My wife worked for Unocal, then Dynegy (natty gas who went bankrupt with Enron), then for a wind company; new wind and solar energy is cheaper than even natty gas generation now, and this price advantage will continue.  The energy world has rapidly changed the last 15 years, but oil/gas control our politicians; it is what it is.

Oil/gas prices have largely (not completely but almost) gone up because there were 3--that's right, 3!-price/demand collapses in the last 15 years.  Bankers are tired of issueing debt to frackers who default on bonds every price collapse, so now the mid-range producers and large producers are gobbling up the wild-cat drillers (small, mid, and large) who drilled and rather than using cash flow kept levering up and defaulted on their debt, 3x over 15 years, and they still got debt issued, until the COVID demand collapse.  Basically, US Banks got tired of getting defaulted on those bonds and they demand free cash flow now, cash flow that will pay for drilling, not debt to pay for drilling.  Period.  That's why gas and oil were expensive last year after the COVID price/demand collapse; banks aren't going to fund it anymore. Period. Show me free cash flow or you don't get us helping you issue bonds. 

That's it, in a nutshell.  Oxxy and Exxon will start producing more, but they aren't going to lever up like the wildcat frackers. Oil/gas prices are already going down, so the banks might even be in for another price/demand collapse if a recession hits.

They may still try to get air superiority, but won’t be running high risk missions like flying into Kyiv directly.

Being able to deny Russia their air superiority doesn’t mean that Ukraine has air superiority that can stop Russian jets from flying. Also that doesn’t mean Russia won’t do any sorties at all because they would definitely try to change that.
