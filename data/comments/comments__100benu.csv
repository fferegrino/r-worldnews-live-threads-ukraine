Day 311-312 of my updates from Kharkiv.

As expected yesterday Russians tried to ruin the New Year’s Eve for us with everything they had, but they failed as usual, no major damage was inflicted anywhere and our energy infrastructure remained relatively intact. They really did try to throw everything they still had to make us suffer, only firing 20 missiles is just laughable, but they had to do it because they didn’t manage to hurt us enough with their previous missile strike.

They launched a ton of Shaheds this time because they didn’t have nearly enough missiles ready for a big strike, but the vast majority of them were intercepted. Just in Kyiv 45 drones were shot down, I’m pretty sure there was just one confirmed hit on one of Kyiv’s energy infrastructure facilities, other missiles and drones were aimed at civilians. What is the point in hitting residential buildings? Do they still think that it will scare us? It never will, all it does is it reinforces our conviction that Russia must be completely defeated at any cost, there aren’t any people left in Ukraine that will settle for anything less at this point.

They also hit a hotel in Kyiv which they claimed was a “NATO base”. Do they seriously believe in that? A NATO base in a hotel that everyone can see and that is open for customers? Their target choices yesterday were very weird, they did hit a single military target in Khmelnytskyi, but all other missiles and drones hit stuff like houses, hotels, a children hospital in Kherson, some garages in Mykolaiv and so on. 

Their goal this time was probably just to ruin celebrations for us, but they didn’t even manage to do that. Here in Kharkiv there was just one explosion in the evening, which most people missed and we don’t even know what it was, most likely just our air defense. We had no problems with electricity here, and judging by the amount of lit up windows around us it seems like around 90% of people are back in the city and celebrating the New Year. But it doesn’t even really feel like New Year, there’s no snow and it is very warm outside. It seems that even nature is against Russia in this war, their plan to “freeze” Europe completely failed.

**We have heard about a potential winter offensive, but when?**

Currently it still looks like it's muddy and mild around Melitopol (using it as an example as it's in the South). In about a week it looks like another cold snap. If this cold snap continues, it's likely the earliest we will see something is late Jan, early Feb.

But we shall see. For the type of offensive work that Ukraine has been conducting - highly mobile and aggressive, often encirclements, they need the ground to be frozen.

I would still bet on the south rather than larger efforts in the East simply due to the amount of defensive lines and troop concentration we've heard reports of.

One thing I'm unsure of is just how much the ground freezes in the South, as I've heard different accounts from different people. Some say it almost always does but sometimes late in winter, others recount that there is almost always some mud, particularly on dirt roads and fields.

Still, best guess is late Jan at the earliest.

Either way it will be interesting to see what Ukraine does this winter...

Edit: keep in mind this is still subjective analysis but for those wondering, I've been pretty good with timelines and excellent with direction (although my one failure has been expecting a Melitopol offensive since June - it's my Dark Horse...

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg believes that Russia is preparing a new wave of offensive against Ukraine, and also warns to not underestimate the impact of the mobilization carried out in the Russian Federation.

Jens Stoltenberg emphasized: Ukraine has the advantage on the battlefield now, and for a long time. However, Ukraine has not yet felt the full force of the ""partial mobilization"" from the fall.

> ""Ukrainian forces have been advancing for several months, but we also know that Russia has mobilized much more forces (than it used on the battlefield), many of them are currently undergoing training.""

According to the Sec Gen, available data indicates that Russia is ""ready to continue the war and intends to potentially launch a new offensive."" 

Stoltenberg emphasized: Ukraine needs to continue receiving support, and the West and NATO should also be prepared to support for a long time. 

> ""We will be by your side no matter what. We will help you until victory,"" he assured Ukraine.

Stoltenberg is also convinced that the war will end with negotiations with Russia, but that good conditions must be created in order to commence negotiations.

> ""What Ukraine can achieve at this table depends entirely on the strength on the battlefield,"" he said.

I know people joke about the intelligence of those in the Kremlin, but they have to know by now that conventional terror bombings in war in a country as large as Ukraine don't work, and that occupying and taking over the entire country is impossible. The Russian objective is to occupy the country, reeducate Ukrainians into Russians, and kill those who resist. I believe if the Russian military started having battlefield success and Kyiv was in danger, Ukrainian allies would put boots on the ground to prevent the death of millions of innocent civilians. That will never happen because Ukraine will keep getting stronger and will destroy Russian armed forces by itself, but it's hard to believe its allies would just let the whole country be genocided this far into the war. 

The only reason it makes sense to me that Russia continues to target civilians is to maintain domestic control in Russia. Their leadership knows that they will lose the war and likely all be killed in a revolution or end up in a war crimes tribunal. If the Russian public still think that Russia has a chance to get ""something"" out of the war, it may delay the inevitable. So the Kremlin is ordering hundreds of terror attacks against innocent civilians every month, as well as sending tens of thousands of Russian people to their certain death, merely out of self preservation and to avoid admitting a mistake. 

I'd believe the Danish theory that Putin ordered the initial invasion due to madness from a cancer drug or something, since it's one of the only possible ways to explain such a foolish decision, but at this point everyone in the Russian leadership is equally responsible for war crimes against Ukraine, not just Putin.

if we push Russia past caring about the optics from their side, if we make them feel desperate to win because they're being murdered and thoroughly beaten by advanced weaponry then they will respond in kind with drastic measures. so this is the conundrum. this is why the war has to be a slog that makes him unpopular, why Putin has to lose respect slowly within his own elite ranks, why Russia's economy has to look doomed long term.. because a quick win is profoundly more dangerous.

Kazakhstan was the automatic holder of the USSR's seat for a while as the last Republic to declare independence from, or more correctly the dissolution of, the USSR as an entity. They did actually work through an informal, non-voted on transfer of said seat to Russia.

The Russian Federation, as the successor of the Russian SFSR, claimed *most* of the USSR's political and social machinery as part of a continuation plan. It also retained full control of the launch codes of all Soviet nuclear weapons (including ones possessed by Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine), and a number of other things that were transferred over by Kazakhstan or just assumed uncontested. A few weird things did happen where Russia did not retain primary control, like the fact that the Belarusian KGB is the original Soviet KGB and the FSB was a re-foundation of an intelligence service for the same purpose. However, most people agreed that for practical purposes, the continuation state of the USSR was the Russian Federation and all other states were new (or newly re-independent states). It's not hard in most situations to see why, the Baltic States were initially independent and forcibly absorbed by the USSR as part of post-WW2 agreements, Ukraine was basically strongarmed into joining, many of the ""-stans"" were once independent too. The Russian SFSR had been the centre of administration of the entire Soviet Union and always held a slightly elevated position within the nation's constituents.

So, it's kinda a not totally straightforward situation.

Worth noting that Kazakhstan gave the seat of the USSR to Russia willingly. Most of the other former members of the USSR also agreed at the time, at least verbally, that this was a good idea. However, no formal UN motion actually took place to confirm this, unlike with the transfer of the ""China"" seat from Taiwan (formally the Republic of China/RoC) to the current mainland China (the People's Republic of China/PRC), where this was acknowledged and ratified by a UN vote, *General Assembly Resolution 2578*.",False,1672593915.0,t3_100benu,t1_j2io9vh,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

Izyum and Lyman are examples of what can be achieved in days to a couple of weeks.

Furthermore, in the South there are certain vulnerabilities should a decent break through happen to between Melitopol-Mariupol-Berdyansk.

From there, Crimea and the rest of the southern theatre is cut off from supply and it becomes a matter of time.

So yes, there is some massive potential in a Southern breakthrough of some kind.

In the East I would guess it would be smaller scale encirclements, so even in 2-3 weeks there is the potential to liberate quite a few places depending on troop densities and support.

The fact is that more and more Ukrainians are being trained, more equipment delivered. They have not lost so much that Izyum/Lyman type offensives are impossible.

And Russia has poured more equipment and people into Ukraine, but these are no where near the calibre of their veterans or starting equipment. We've begun to see more and more T-62 variants for example, which are 50+ years old in some cases.

They talked about the Russian war colleges, the military-academic publications (that the generals clearly know how to wage war), they just get blindsided and undermined.

For example, it was Patushev-Bortnikov-Putin who planned this—zero military experience.  Shoigu added last minute, he’s honestly a bit of a dunce.  Meanwhile, there’s actual generals who’ve spent their entire lives planning and preparing—who were never consulted.  So, the necessary logistics weren’t there at the time of invasion. 

So an example of how to compensate would be, that despite vast swaths of equipment being unusable or phantomly missing, plan ahead by not believing that x-amount is being sent and instead order essentially all sent except skeleton needs.  Putin was pulling from where don’t need, but those numbers were false.  A General planning would’ve known, would’ve over-prepared, not just directing the central military district and southern military district to send equipment, which is what happened.  Later, pulled from Eastern District, which itself is like 10day train journey, not to mention the days of loading and unloading.  Basically, a General would order to send like...90% ? of all military districts equipment to the Western and Southern military districts, those districts would’ve had teams prepared to inventory, prepare, divide, organize logistics.  (Well, except Moscow Military District and Kaliningrad, which would be only 50%, most likely.)  Then they determine what is kept in reserve.  They keep the stock piles there instead of back at districts, distribute to front.

There’s no reason to have tanks in the Northern Military District, send them all, and don’t believe them when say how many have that are useable.  Then, based on evaluation of inventory, invasion plans can be altered.  For example, not invade on three fronts?   Putin, however, wants to leave all these borders protected due to imaginary threats, doesn’t send everything, doesn’t even send *necessary* equipment at the time of invasion.  (For example, I remember Gen Hertling being in disbelief that Russia came up from Crimea, intended to cross all the way to odesa, which he was saying required crossing three rivers, and they brought absolutely no bridge-building equipment with them.  How that was beyond poor planning, how they clearly didn’t know were invading bc they have entire engineering brigades, but none there.  Later, we learned the pontoon-launching marine units hadn’t even been sent to do that.  And they have entire military branch that knows this! That can do this, so was clearly not planned.) And, Putin believes it when he gets report that a military district has a certain amount, so says sending 100 tanks to western Belarus, but maybe 8 are useable, a General would have said send 500 to western district, the separate logistics team (who has no motive to deceive) evaluates how many can be outfitted/repaired, then tally, if less than 50, then alter plans in xyz-fashion.",1672599273.0,1672595701.0,t3_100benu,t1_j2i1s82,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

We already see UA maintenance struggling to maintain 20-35 PzH2000 - in fact most have to be sent back to the west to be fixed - so how much harder do you think it will be with added IFVs? 

You can go back and look at what the Ukrainians themselves asked for at the start of the war - they always asked for material to equip several brigades in full. 

Marder here is especially problematic because unlike Bradley or others it does not use munitions that are compatible with other IFVs, it is pretty much the only IFV in usage using that particular main gun ammo. 

Which is why I said that it would make more sense to send hundreds of marders instead of 60s that would have to be refurbished by the industry over the coming months anyway. Or continue to send soviet equipment from nations receiving marder (like Greece) instead.

EDIT: I realize it is very comforting and the easy way to fall into old patterns like ""these all would exist immediately and Germany is being bad by holding them back for *insert reason here*"" but it is not as simple as that. Especially people who downvote without having an argument are - I suspect - more like children who want to lash out at uncomfortable truths.

Can also buy in other country, drive it to Russia, and then pay a fee at border—a slightly cheaper option, but slower bc that method requires apply for visa to leave Russia.  These two methods were well-known sources of revenue. 

Despite Russia pretending the occupied regions are “new Russian territories,” they still have a border guard station, have to go thru customs, etc.  

So the Russians stealing cars—like in Mariupol—they’d have to paint Z on them and leave them on base.  They didn’t get to drive to their house.  

And if showed up at guard station, solo and not in an obvious caravan going of mixed military & civilian vehicles, and don’t have title to car, don’t have registration, don’t have insurance, the border guards have been seizing those vehicles.  

But there’s problems not addressed in the article.  One is that Russia has failed to establish the necessary offices and procedures in their new territories—like a registration office for vehicles.  That’s one element.

But the other is that this was actually done begrudged—it means Russia is losing a source of revenue.  But this is done to motivate, bc they’re out of ways to motivate and this is like a bribe.

Third, it was also done begrudgingly bc there’s a known corruption problem, and this war has demonstrated it, *again*, but to civilians.  It was just about 10 years ago MOD was scandalized by discovered corruption, Minister of Defense’s own wife went to prison.

Not really relevant.  

The price is the difference between new M31 missiles and the shitty M26s that need to be destroyed.  They were supposed to have already bren destroyed.  (Law dates to 2008) 

USA keeps huge stockpiles of weapons ""just in case"".  There is no way the US Army will ever allow aid to deplete all inventories to zero.  That would become a political fiasco.  We are talking about whether the M26 sits in the ""just in case"" wearhouse or the M31 sits in those wearhouses.  

The AW model of the M31 has an adjustable spray of tungsten.  It us quite lethal over a large area.  The down side is the cost if tungsten.  

There is definity a risk.  Ukraine loses if Ukrainians decide that the damage done to their country is too excessive.  The moral upper hand is an advantage that Kyiv has over Moscow.

I just looked this up. [From an article on how one of them recently fled house arrest and Russia dressed as a food delivery courier](https://www.dw.com/en/pussy-riot-on-tour-following-band-co-founders-escape-from-russia/a-61749767):

>Solidarity for Ukraine

>On tour, the band will also be demonstrating solidarity for Ukraine.

>This February, the band auctioned NFTs for a picture of Ukraine's blue-yellow flag. In the first 24 hours, the auction brought in $3 million (€2.84 million), which Pussy Riot gave away to the non-profit organization Come Back Alive. The NGO helps equip Ukrainian soldiers with technical devices like night vision glasses and infrared cameras.

>Proceeds from the ongoing concerts will also be sent to Ukraine. ""I have a lot of friends in Ukraine,"" Pussy Riot member Nadezhda Tolokonnikova told Rolling Stone. ""I think Ukrainians are extremely brave, beautiful, fierce and inspirational.""

So they earned $3 million for Ukraine with that, which is quite a bit more than I have. 

Of course this isn't big news and it's bullshit to dismiss this like that. The fact is, lashing out at your supporters in not nice and we should do our part to educate people that they are attacking the wrong targets.
