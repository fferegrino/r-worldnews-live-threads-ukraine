Day 125 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled again during the day, some people got injured, but thankfully I don’t think anyone died. At 11pm, as always, we got our daily dose of missiles from Belgorod, this time it was just 3 that landed in the city, and one that landed somewhere in oblast. After one of the missiles a big fire started, not sure what was hit yet, we will know later.

And yesterday they did indeed hit another school with missiles; as usual there was not a single military target in sight. They hit 2 different schools, 2 days in a row. They are not just fighting against the truth, but against education as well. Also they hit an empty car dealership with one of their missiles, such a valuable military target. 

And just a couple of hours ago the video that shows Kremenchuck’s mall being hit by a missile was released, so now Russia can’t claim that it was just some fire that started randomly, they can’t even say that there was ammo inside, as there were no secondary explosions. It clearly shows that mall being hit by Russian Kh-22 missile, so what will they say now? Will they now completely switch to saying “they deserved it for shelling Donbass” or will they come up with something else?

They always bring up “you shelled Donbass for 8 years” but for some reason the Donbass they are talking about was basically undamaged right up until they started this war. People living on the occupied territory are just now saying that they need to open up the bomb shelters, which for some reason were closed up until now, more than 4 months into full-scale war. 

Many of them are saying that they weren’t shelled even once during all those “8 years.” Wait, but weren’t they being shelled every day for 8 years by those “Ukrainian Nazis” then why are the bomb shelters still sealed off? Where were they hiding all this time? When we started getting shelled our bomb shelters were immediately opened, but theirs didn’t get opened even after the “8 years of shelling”?

They fucking manufactured all this garbage propaganda and Russians happily ate it up. Up until this war started nobody in Russia cared about Donbass, yet right after the war started they all suddenly started caring about it. They also love to say how “14 000 Donbass’ children were killed by Nazis” but 14 000 is the total number of people that died *on both sides combined,* this number includes combatants, civilians make up only a fraction of this number, but for Russians it’s “14 000 dead children of Donbass.”",False,1656468723.0,t3_vmdwcg,t3_vmdwcg,,0,87,0,87,1,0,

He added: “Our task is to hold back the enemy as long as possible and to inflict maximum damage on them … As long as Russia’s army remains in one place, time is on our side. We will receive weapons from the west.”

👉 In the north near Kharkiv the war remains a stalemate.

👉 In the east near Lysychansk there was reported fighting, but there were no real change in the battle lines.  Ukrainian ground lines of communication into Lysychansk remain precarious and there are battles in the city itself.

👉 In the south around Kherson, the US acknowledged recent Ukrainian gains in the area but Ukraine and russia remain mostly silent on this front.   We did get reports that russia has started transferring troops out of the Donbas area into the Zaporizhzhia region to bolster their sagging defenses in the area.

👉 The big news of the day was that russia followed up its recent bombing of an apartment building in Kyiv with a bombing of a packed shopping mall in Kremenchuk. At least 40 people are missing and 59 injured.  russia followed up this war crime by opening fire on a line of civilians waiting at a water tanker in besieged Lysychansk -- killing 8 and wounding 21.  

👉 Social media is beginning to pay attention to the amount of ammo depots Ukraine is destroying with its new MLRS systems.  In tandem with russias amazing amount of shelling (as many as 50,000 a day), and reports russia is now taking ammo out of Belarus it may be that russia is going to have problems supplying its artillery ""soon"".  This remains speculation at this time, but something to put a pin in.

👉 Baykar, the Turkish drone manufacturer, upon learning that Ukrainians had crowd sourced enough funds to pay for 3 new drones, donated 3 drones to the Ukrainian armed forces and asked that the crowd sourced funds be used for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine.  This is the second time Baykar has donated its drones when Ukrainian crowd sourcing attempted to purchase the systems.

Russia ""cannot and must not win"" the war in Ukraine and Western powers will support Kyiv for as long as necessary, French President Emmanuel Macron said today amid talk of some international fatigue with the war effort.

Speaking at the end of the G7 summit, Mr Macron told a news conference it was clear that Moscow now had the sole objective of trying to force Ukraine to surrender.

""I really hope that the end (of the conflict) can be achieved by the end of the year, with a certainty and a desire, which is that Russia cannot and must not win,"" the French leader said.

Mr Macron also repeated that those who had committed war crimes needed to be held accountable.

He added: ""Our support for Ukraine and our sanctions against Russia will continue for as long as is necessary and with the necessary intensity in the coming days and weeks.""

As part of efforts to ramp up pressure on Russia, Mr Macron said he backed the idea of an oil and gas price cap, including a US proposal to cap Russian oil, but said it needed to be studied and broadened to include an ""alliance"" of buyers to define the cap and make it effective.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 28 June 2022
 
- Ukrainian forces continue to consolidate their positions on higher ground in the city of Lyschansak, after falling back from Sieverodonetsk. Ukrainian forces continue to disrupt Russian command and control with successful strikes deep behind Russian lines.



- Over 24-26 June, Russia launched unusually intense waves of strikes across Ukraine using long-range missiles. These weapons highly likely included the Soviet-era AS-4 KITCHEN and more modern AS-23a KODIAK missiles, fired from both Belarussian and Russian airspace.



- These weapons were designed to take on targets of strategic importance, but Russia continues to expend them in large numbers for tactical advantage. Similarly, it fielded the core elements of six different armies yet achieved only tactical success at Sieverodonetsk. The Russian armed forces are increasingly hollowed out. They currently accept a level of degraded combat effectiveness, which is probably unsustainable in the long term.

The US has today banned the import of new Russian gold and  imposed sanctions on over 100 targets.  
  
The US Treasury said in a statement it had imposed sanctions on 70 entities, many of which it said are critical to Russia's defence industrial base, as well as 29 people in an effort to hinder Russia's ability to develop and deploy weapons and technology used in the invasion of Ukraine.  
  
Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement: ""Targeting Russia's defence industry will degrade (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's capabilities and further impede his war against Ukraine, which has already been plagued by poor morale, broken supply chains, and logistical failures.""  
  
Also sanctioned was Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate Rostec and the United Aircraft Corporation, the maker of Russia's MiG and Sukhoi fighter jets.  
  
 The US Treasury said it aimed to ""weaken Russia's ability to continue its aerial assault on Ukraine.""  
  
On Sunday, the UK, US, Canada, and Japan kicked off the G7 summit by banning imports of Russian gold.  
  
The ban will apply to newly mined or refined gold but will not affect previously exported Russian-origin gold.

Ukraine's foreign minister has hit back at Russia's reaction to the shopping centre strike in Kremenchuk, which killed at least 18 people.

""Ordinary Russians cheer on social media. Russian diplomats and officials spread insane conspiracy theories, denying that the strike even happened.

It is important to point out here that Russians are starved of accurate information on the war - or the ""special military operation"" as it is reported there.

Russia has continually claimed to not have targeted civilians during its invasion - a claim argued furiously by the West, which has accused the country of committing war crimes. 

Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, claimed the attack was a ""Ukrainian provocation"".

He said on Twitter: ""Exactly what Kyiv regime needs to keep focus of attention on Ukraine before (the) NATO Summit.""

As we told you in our 6.18 post, at least 18 people have been killed after a Russian missile strike in the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk.

The attack on Monday, which has been condemned as a war crime by world leaders, also left dozens of people wounded.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said more than 1,000 civilians were inside the mall at the time of the strike.

Ukrainian State Emergency Service firefighters have been working to take away debris from the shopping centre, which has been reduced to piles of tangled metal and rubble.

The pictures below show an aerial view of the damage.

**K**H in Ukrainian names is the Cyrillic letter Х, which is like the CH in ""loch"" or slightly less accurately, just a K or H. For example, Kherson/Херсо́н is roughly hare-SOHN. Meanwhile, **C**H in Ukrainian names is the letter Ч, which *is* like a normal English CH. For example, Lysychans'k/Лисича́нськ is lih-sih-CHANSK. For further contrast, H in Ukrainian names is Г, which is straight up just an English H sound in Ukrainian, or a G in Russian, which is also why you'll occasionally (especially from Russian sources) see Луганськ/Luhans'k called Луганск/Lu**g**ansk

Also, the deal with apostrophes and Ukrainian: Ukrainian, being an East Cyrillic language, has pairs of hard and soft consonants. For the most part, this is indicated by have two letters for every vowel sound, depending on if it's after a hard or soft consonant, but it gets weirder when there isn't a following vowel. Generally speaking, you'll see the letter ь used, which *used* to make a sound of its own, but is now just a dummy vowel letter, similar to silent E, to indicate that a consonant's soft. (I'm going to *say* it used to make the same sound as the second syllable in ""roses"" if you speak a dialect where it's pronounced differently than ""Rosa's"") In transliterations, this will normally be represented by an apostrophe if it's included at all, like how Luhans'k is technically ever so slightly more accurate than Luhansk.

However, this gets complicated when you need a hard consonant + the English Y sound. Normally, Y+vowel just uses the soft vowel letters, but that would make the consonant soft, so you need a workaround. In Russian, they use the hard sign, ъ, which is a similar no-longer-a-vowel letter and actually used to be required at the end of any words that ended with a hard consonant. Meanwhile, in Ukrainian, they just add an apostrophe, like in п'ять (five). This causes issues with transliteration for obvious reasons, so the usual workaround, if you're being exact, is to double the apostrophe in the Latin alphabet, like writing п'ять (which also happens to have a soft sign) p''jat'

EDIT: Added note on the letter Г

EDIT:

**tl;dr**- KH is technically the sound in ""loch"", but can be replaced with K or H in English, while CH and H actually *are* English CH and H respectively, although don't be surprised if pro-Russian sources replace that lone H with a G, like in Enerhodar vs Energodar. Additionally, don't be surprised if you see an extra apostrophe in Ukrainian names, either at the end of a word or in the middle of a consonant cluster, like Luhans'k. There's just an added letter there that normally gets ignored in English.

(Also, I really like including it in a lot of names ending in -s'k, since their Russian cognates distinctly lack a soft sign)",1656436964.0,1656430610.0,t3_vmdwcg,t3_vmdwcg,,0,31,0,31,1,0,

None of this has been confirmed by Ukraine sources.  But Ukrainian sources got spanked by the UAF for disclosing earlier retreats before being officially released.   

If true, do remember that Ukraine's tactics in the Donbas has always been to trade land for time and to make the russians bleed for every inch, and here the Donbas is red in rivers of russian blood.

> Throughout yesterday and last night the enemy while covering behind weak rearguards conducted a fast withdrawal from Lysyhansk and its surroundings. In some sections the enemy’s withdrawal was so quick that units of LDPR AF were unable to closely pursue them due to an almost complete lack of combat wheeled and track vehicles. At the moment fierce fights are only taking place in the “neck” of the “bag”, where the enemy is holding positions with an aim to allow as many of their detachments as possible to withdraw. Up to a half of the city is already abandoned, clearing is taking place. The enemy also dumped their positions at Siverskyi Donets north of Lysychansk and our units there have already crossed the river.
 
> Most likely the battle for Lysychansk will end within the next (perhaps slightly longer) day, and the general operation will end this week.
 
> The operation will end when our units chasing the withdrawing forces of UAF will run into the newly organised defence line at Seversk.
 
> In general – the enemy has already suffered, and will inevitably suffer significant losses during the retreat (most of all in vehicles). But it will preserve the bulk of the experienced manpower. In this case from UAF’s side there is an obvious primacy of military expediency over political-propagandist aims. From RF AF side there is a tactical victory. Creating a “cauldron” with a complete destruction of Severodonetsk-Lysychansk group of the enemy was not achieved despite all the efforts and very sensitive (in total over one and half months) losses. As a bonus, Lysychansk will not be razed to the ground during prolonged street fights.
 
> In general, Lysychansk has been finally finished.

Fitting into this claim is the following message by pro-Russian “Yuzhnyi Veter” channel, dated 26 June, which says withdrawal from Lysychansk is expected:

> UAF withdrew from Severodonetsk, the withdrawal from Lysychansk is planned through conducting active defence with gradual abandonment of positions.
 
> Regarding the direction of further offensive operations, only the Wagner PMC’s attack on Bakhmut remains in the active phase, however the whole line of defence there has been dug up with trenches wo or three echelons deep.
 
> At the same time, Ukrainian General Staff has already begun regrouping and is now transferring recently formed detachments both to Donbas and Zaporizhye. These brigades most likely will replace those who suffered the most at the frontline.
 
> The bottom line is that in a month after restoring the combat readiness, UAF will once again have strategic reserves of 5-6 brigades, which together with additional foreign weapon supplies can create conditions for counter-attacking activities. Therefore, the start of these is likely possible in August, roughly when the head of GUR Budanov predicted.

From CNN's Clare Sebastian, David Goldman and Mark Thompson

Russia has defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution more than a century ago.

Following reports Moscow had failed to pay about $100 million in interest on two bonds during a 30-day grace period which expired Sunday, the White House said the default showed the power of Western sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.

""This morning's news around the finding of Russia's default, for the first time in more than a century, situates just how strong the reactions are that the US, along with allies and partners, have taken, as well as how dramatic the impact has been on Russia's economy,"" a senior administration official said on the sidelines of a G7 summit in Germany.

Russia denied it was in default, saying the payments due Sunday had been made, in dollars and euros, on May 27 and the money was stuck with Euroclear, a clearinghouse based in Belgium.

In a statement posted late Monday, Moody's credit ratings agency said the ""missed coupon payment constitutes a default.""

""On 27 June, holders of Russia's sovereign debt had not received coupon payments on two eurobonds worth $100 million by the time the 30-calendar-day grace period expired, which we consider an event of default under our definition,"" it said.

Moody's also predicted Russia would default on more payments in the future, given a decree on June 22 by the Kremlin it would service its foreign debt in rubles, rather than the currencies the bonds were issued in.

The historic default — the first time Russia has defaulted since 1918 — had been widely anticipated after half the country's foreign reserves were frozen and the US Treasury ended a carve-out from sanctions allowing US bondholders to be repaid by Russia

It's unavoidable with Putin's plans and actions, and fearing/appeasing delusional Mr. Peter The Great will not make things better, just like it didn't make things better with Hitler, only worse. Fight a possible bad war now or a guaranteed worse war, possibly in multiple theatres at the same time, later..  choose. Right now we are at our strongest, and there's no guarantee Russia will dare to actively attack NATO troops that are simply entrenched in Ukrainian territory.**

Can someone explain to me why there aren't NATO boots in Ukraine to *protect the peace?* While also formally declaring no intention to actively attack Russian troops or set even one foot into Russian territory. Defense and counter-artillery only.

According to Russia, there is no war. Yet Ukraine is getting ravaged. What stops NATO from engaging in a peacekeeping operation in Ukraine, protecting its current Frontline to prevent Russia from advancing? As long as they only hold their ground and not push forward, what's Russia realistically going to do?

It would be strange for Putin to go nuclear if he's not even formally at war. And since NATO troops are not actively attacking Russian troops, he can't really justify declaring war.

I have a somber feeling that this will end very poorly for Ukraine if we don't directly intervene, possibly facing total annexation and genocide by Russia. Supplying weapons and sanctioning Russia is not enough. And NATO has nukes too, we can make it clear that any nuclear attack on NATO troops or territory would trigger an equal or worse response.

“It clearly shows that mall being hit by Russian Kh-22 missile, so what will they say now? Will they now completely switch to saying “they deserved it for shelling Donbass” or will they come up with something else?”

As you know, I’m sure Russia will come up with something completely ridiculous. *It is so, so annoying.* At this rate, they never are going to take responsibility for anything. I know you (and everyone else here) know all this, but yeah, it’s getting really old.

On the flip side, while there is still a fog of war, I find it good to read in general that supplies continue to come into Ukraine and that some of that machinery is being used very well. I realize so much has been destroyed and that this isn’t all of the sudden going to be easy. That said, there seem to be a lot of reasons to have hope.

For a while, both tanks were developed alongside together, with the T-72 noticeably lagging behind the T-64 for many years even after the T-72 received priority after the T-64's design lead was disposed of. That's why Ukraine's T-64 units are still such capable contenders against Russia's stocks of T-72s.

Former president (then senator) Obama, pushed [bill](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2573557/Flashback-Senator-Obama-pushed-destruction-15-000-TONS-ammunition-400-000-small-arms-1-000-anti-aircraft-missiles-Ukraine.html) to destroy ammunition and weapons in Ukraine. He visited Ukraine personally in 2005 to watch it in action. 

>As a U.S. senator, Barack Obama won $48 million in federal funding to help Ukraine destroy thousands of tons of guns and ammunition – weapons which are now unavailable to the Ukrainian army.

But Obama was not the one who started that endeavor. His efforts were supported by a lot of none profilitation agreements, and disarmament programs, that led to destruction of Ukraine defensive potential, including weapons like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-17_Elbrus), a rocket system that can hit targets up to 300 km away.  But more importantly – it was supported by people in Ukrainian government, who sought recognition and favors from the west, trying to paint itself as a reliable partner, ready to disarm itself for world peace.  Gradually, over the years, Ukraine disarmed itself more and more, complying with western requests, and believing they have “no-one to fight with”.  And right now Ukraine is denied transfer of similar long range missile systems, like MGM-140 ATACMS which could turn the tide of this war in Ukraine’s favor. 

West advised and convinced Ukraine to disarm from the moment of independence. Ukraine first gave up its nuclear weapons, and then majority of strategic aviation, and long range missiles to comply with western programs demands. 
In 2004, Under the newly elected president Yushchenko, which sought closer ties to the west, Ukraine disarmament continued - now in the form of ""optimizing the army"" and selling ""excessive stock"". These sells included number of weapon systems, IFV and even tanks. All needed by Ukraine right now, as it fights Russian invasion in 2022. 

This commitment to disarm itself from Ukraine, was welcomed and supported by the west and US, who (as government sources in Ukraine claim) were ""helping to transfer Ukraine’s army towards NATO standards"". It appeared as a sensible and noble thing to disarm at the time, and Ukraine was not opposed to it. 

In that period of time, from 2004, it was obvious that US was interested in Ukraine joining NATO. Ukraine started a push towards NATO, and tried to ""optimize"" its army and followed many western recommendation (which included destruction of weapons, and more disarmament), to get a chance to join NATO. But [Ukraine was denided](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/09/04/that-time-ukraine-tried-to-join-nato-and-nato-said-no/), because of Putin, and Angela Merkel, who blocked NATO for Ukraine, or even talks about it, at his request. 

So all this time, Ukraine followed all recommendations, disarmed itself, and did what west asked for nothing. NATO was closed to Ukraine. And in 2014, Russia attacked and started a bloody war with annexation of Crimea.

Now, as Ukraine attacked by Russia yet again, it depends on western help more than ever. But west is hesitant and slow in providing Ukraine weapons it needs to win the war. Ukraine is in dire need of fighter planes, and long range missile systems, artillery systems, IFVs in large numbers.  Freedom of Ukrainian people, and existence of Ukrainian state – depends on these deliveries, and on continued western support.",1656457333.0,1656456930.0,t3_vmdwcg,t1_ie40fh4,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

Wait a minute. I am struggling to reconcile this view, granted that short term is pretty vague. RU invaded with just under 200K estimated troops, and Ukraine had a similar number active. I've seen estimates both have had maybe 60K casualties so far.  Probably a bit more for RU probably a bit less for UA.

RU drafted from occupied areas, estimates seem to be 10-20K ish maybe so far, a max of 50-60K potential available if they find and get everyone. So these are conscripts for the meat grinder, not pro soldiers and likely unmotivated at best. People are actively hiding. [Source](https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/04/28/forced-conscription-how-russia-wipes-out-the-male-population-of-occupied-donbas/)

RU theoretically has a ton of people nationwide to draw from, but no general mobilization so far.  Even if they did it, that's months to enable by all accounts, maybe can speed it up some by tossing more untrained people into the meat grinder?

Meanwhile Ukraine has hundreds of thousands of volunteers signing up to fight now, maybe 700K. [Source](https://www.euronews.com/2022/05/21/live-sievierodonetsk-shelling-brutal-and-pointless-zelenskyy-says-as-russia-continues-offe).  Out of a country of 44M. Defending homeland. Seems plausible.

e416229c530635c789aa5ed866a0a3af,vmdwcg,ie4800e,"3 reasons: boiling the frog, training, and force multiplication.

Boiling the frog: by doing it drip by drip and publishing some while hiding others, the real numbers can be shielded.  ""We gave them 4"", then 6 show up in theater, ""We gave them 8"", then 12 show up in theater, etc.  It's slow, preventing a large diplomatic event or a sudden response--will there be only a few ever, or will this grow to dozens?  It prevents escalation (I do not agree with this viewpoint, but it is the rationale).

Training: sending small groups over to see what works and train others, then ramping it up as it goes.  Often estimates of how long it will take to train are overstated--the Ukrainians are not stupid, they learn quite quick and are very motivated, and the amount of training needed to maintain something for peacetime life is much higher than high-attrition warfare--so it's often a learning experience for both sides.  For example, learning to run a T-72 for a new tanker with no experience to professional standards takes at least a year, but for an experienced tanker coming from another vehicle to quickly swap over midwar, that period can be as little as *a few hours*.

Force multiplication: Western artillery and Ukrainian/Western doctrine are wildly different than Russian doctrine, and you can see this in combat videos.  The 5:1 artillery advantage is meaningless when one side is using its artillery as a *saturation* weapon, and the other is using its artillery as *a giant sniper rifle* because it has modern electronic fire control*.*  As an example, even *unguided* rounds from an M777 have a CEP of something like >50m, which is the kill radius; basically, the guided rounds are for very hard/moving targets, the unguided for infantry.  There's quite a bit of footage of even *unguided mortars*, being used to precision-hit tanks at max range.

&#x200B;

As for ramp-up of production, it's happened but it's quiet.  Generally Western manufacturers run pretty steadily but at a low rate.  Personally I always thought this was a bad move, and that being able to bulk-produce cheap guided or unguided shells is important, but, I don't make military policy.",False,1656457196.0,t3_vmdwcg,t1_ie3dxv5,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

M-777 howitzers breaking down after just a few rounds fired? 

Shit, somebody better tell BAE that's built literally thousands of them and the armies that put them to extensive use in Afghanistan & Iraq.

GPS-guided precision munitions being jammed? Can't jam the modern inertial navigation system that acts as backup.

Hell, the USA didn't even give Ukraine GPS-guided Excalibur shells for the M-777, the few provided by Canada aren't in sufficient number to be be used routinely, and most of the M-777 the USA provided were lacking the electronics to even fire guided artillery shells. 


>What sober military men in potential adversary countries across the globe see is that Russia has, with one hand tied behind its back, eviscerated the massive, relatively well-armed and well-trained Ukraine military. The US intimidation factor has been forever compromised.

The US military hasn't formally really lifted a finger yet, I think things like the USS Gerald Ford and fleets of F-35 are pretty damn intimidating, but I'm clearly not a geopolitics expert like this guy. 

Lockheed Martin has built over 800 F-35 thus far, Russia's managed like a handful of production SU-57 and there's no sign of them in this conflict, same goes for the MiG-35 with just a dozen or so produced and no sign of use.

Pretty sure people mostly point out how blatantly Russia lies. Ukraine is better but not like they don't make propaganda claims, exaggerate and other shit. If anything I think it's easier for Ukraine to be truthful because Russia has to justify and cover up their clumsy unjust invasion while Ukraine is just defending itself.

But as an example we have tons of stories of Russia claiming they struck military targets and then we have videos and images of the residential or civilian structures it actually struck. Unless Russia makes the claim like they often do that the bombings were conducted by Ukraine on their own citizens.

Or Bucha that was well documented with tons of evidence and independent journalists getting access and Russia lied through its teeth denying everything and even claiming [british agents had been there and done the atrocities to frame Russia.](https://thehill.com/news/3266182-putin-calls-bucha-reports-fake-blames-uk-agents/)

I could go into more detail about my impression about both sides and frankly there's always fog of war in war even when we have mobile phones.

That's the thing: neither side REALLY knows where the others' red-line is.  I'm sure Western leaders have been very specific. And Putin thinks that he can try and test to see how far he can push.  And NATO seems to be VERY careful not to test and prod.

Meaning: You lend 100.000.000 Euros to germany and germany gives you back 99.000.000 Euros in about 10 years (or whatever the interest rate / timeframe is).

Russia now is a party on the world financial market which has proven unreliable. So who would lend them money? Only shady companies like venture capital companies who are giving money with hughe interest rates. This basically means that lending money on the international markets will be next to impossible for russia for the coming years.

And this again means that they will not be able to buy stuff without paying it immediately. They could start printing rubles en masse, but this would only lead to an increased inflation, since there is more money in the market without there being more physical goods / value for this money. Hence inflation.

If people were claiming one, like USA has 500 but can only supply 50 I might believe it or at least I would be much less confident.  The military is not going to want to move pacific assets over to the Atlantic which accounts for a factor of two or three.  The claim that 8 systems breaks the supply chain suggests an extreme problem.

Now, after 8 years, the absolute majority of people who stayed are those who actively prefer to live without the boundaries of the civil society, the rule of law and/or found themselves a nice cushy position in this new order.

It’d domino into a full scale war with nato and Russia. Which trust me no one wants and it’d definitely be world war 3

Ukraine also isn’t in nato. And the Russian troops wouldn’t exactly sit with their thumbs up their asses with nato shooting at them. Putin would definitely fire back.

Different things have different military values. A tractor factory has more value than a paper mill for example, so it makes more sense to destroy it.

Take someone like Carter for instance, yeah he had lots of baggage in office, but take him out of office and he basically became a non-public entity in comparison despite still being involved in major things.

The Clintons never really left the spotlight on purpose, and instead traded on that spotlight because of the power and money it provided. Even the attacks from the right were looked upon as just reflected attention initially, specially when most of the attacks were unfocused and seen as wholly unrealistic like bizarre real estate murder plots.

In fact, I'd argue that kind of game plan can be seen in the political output of Zelensky when it comes to relations with a few of the countries, and arms supplies. Yeah, sometimes it seems like Zelensky is trying to rile people up... because he is, he knows that's one of the easier ways to get attention refocused back on you, specially when dealing with a ""pseudo-ally"" like a less than cooperative but friendly head of state or opposing political party.

Only thing to watch out for is that spotlight is very bright, and very harsh, and only becomes more so over time as the weight of decisions and words while basking in it build up more and more.

For a leader like Zelensky that doesn't matter much because nothing matters other than saving Ukraine and its people, but it can eventually cause polarization that makes broader governance difficult in the longer term.
