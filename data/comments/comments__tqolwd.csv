Day 33 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet today with periodic fighting in the distance. We did hear at least one plane bombing something a couple of times in the evening. And also we saw what looked like a drone or something else being destroyed in the night sky. It looked like fireworks so we didn’t understand what it was at first.

Sadly I wasn’t quick enough, so I didn't manage to film it, whatever it was it dispersed within seconds, there was a single explosion at first and then around 5-7 more explosions followed right after just like regular fireworks.

Also, the start time of the curfew was moved from the usual 6 pm to 8 pm. I guess this means that it's safer now, the Russians have basically stopped trying to attack Kharkiv in the last week or two, and instead are trying to go south around Izyum, where there is constant fighting.

Russia’s most significant battlefield achievement in south Ukraine has been the capture of Kherson in the first week of March – seen as the first important gain towards a possible offensive against Odesa, the country’s third largest city. 

But in recent days, CNN has reported on Russia’s struggles to hold its front line northwest of the city, as well as Ukrainian successes targeting Russian attack helicopters at nearby Kherson airport. 

Now, Ukrainian officials are reporting potentially significant gains elsewhere in the south, pushing Russian forces back as much as around 31 miles (50 kilometers) in fighting near the city of Kryvyi Rih. 

""The enemy is no longer just stopped in all directions - but has actually been pushed back from the distant approaches to the city,"" Oleksandr Vilkul, the top official in Kryvyi Rih, said late Monday.

Today, several more settlements in the Kherson region have been liberated. The invaders are at a distance from Kryvyi Rih of at least 40 kilometers (25 miles), in some directions as much as 60 kilometers (37 miles).""

Previously, Ukrainian officials said Russian troops were within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the city, which has a population of more than 500,000 and lies between Kherson and Dnipro. 

""The contact line is no longer on the border with the Dnipropetrovsk region, and it is already in the Kherson region. Our military shows real bravery and inflicts serious damage on the enemy,"" Vikul said.  

Most residents had remained in Kryvyi Rih since the start of the war, Vikul added. ""You can see for yourself that the city lives and works,"" he said on a video statement posted on Facebook.

ISW: Ukrainian forces will likely seek to take advantage of ongoing Russian force rotations to retake further territory northwest of Kyiv in the coming days.

> Russian forces have not abandoned their objective to encircle and capture Kyiv, despite Kremlin claims that Russian forces will concentrate on eastern Ukraine.  

> The military situation around Kherson did not materially change.  

> Fighting continued in Popasna and Rubizhne, but Russian forces did not make any substantial progress.  

> Russian forces continued to take territory in Mariupol. The Ukrainian General Staff confirmed that Russian forces advanced but said Ukrainian forces are inflicting heavy casualties on Russian forces.

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.

Sanctions against Russia have been unprecedented in speed, the scale of targets, and international cooperation.

But they are NOT comprehensive. They remain a 7/10 or 8/10 in intensity, not a 10/10.

A few myths that require correcting (🧵):

(1) Not all Russian banks have been cut off from SWIFT. In fact, the EU has cut off just 7 Russian banks from SWIFT. Of the 5 largest Russian banks, just one (VTB) is banned from SWIFT. Sberbank, which is by far Russia's largest bank, retains access to SWIFT.

Largest bank groups as of end-October 2018:  
https://i.imgur.com/GtP07IW.jpg

(2) No, ""self-sanctioning"" has not devastated Russia's oil sales. Russian oil is still finding buyers. To truly curb Russia's oil sales, Europe will need to reduce its own imports, and the US & EU will need to launch a global secondary sanctions campaign.

Tanker traffic in March 2022 is on par with previous years:  
https://i.imgur.com/LMy6Jql.jpg

(3) It is only partially true that the effects of sanctions ""worsen over time."" Yes, sanctions will curtail Russia's economic & technological development. But sanctions-induced financial panic is already abating. Keeping up pressure requires ⬆️ sanctions. 

Russia's domestic banking system is gradually stabilizing. Severe bank runs triggered by the war and sanctions appear to have moderated. The chart [below] shows how much the banking system as a whole deposits (+) or borrows (-) from the @bank_of_russia

In Rosaviatsia, the entire network collapsed, all document flow, mail, files on servers were erased, all documents disappeared. In total, approximately 65 terabytes of data have been erased.

“The entire document flow, emails, files on the servers disappeared, now the search for the register of aircraft and aviation personnel is underway, the system of public services has been removed. Lost all incoming and outgoing letters for 1.5 years,” says the source.

According to him, there are no backups, since the Ministry of Finance did not allocate money for this.

The attack occurred due to poor performance of contractual obligations by InfAvia LLC, which operates the IT infrastructure of the Federal Air Transport Agency.

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.

**Re:  Ukrainian shoot-down of Russian aircraft**

Let me open with:  I believe Ukraine is likely padding their numbers, but the comments of folks saying we haven't seen any pictures of them, I would suggest you consider:

1. Most Russian aircraft are operating from stand-off range, which means most of the shoot downs will occur in Russian territory.. and Russia ain't exactly going to post the picture evidence.  This operating position has been widely documented by the UK MOD and US DOD.
2. We do see some videos of helicopters being shot down.
3. It doesn't matter, as it doesn't change what's going on in reality.
4. The caveat to all this is, Ukraine's numbers on both tanks destroyed and troops killed are within the plausible realm, I'm not sure why they would lie about planes specifically, especially when they want planes themselves.. it would make more sense for the narrative to be 'we are powerless against Russia without planes', which isn't exactly what the numbers show.

So the numbers are likely high, but I doubt it's an order of magnitude error.  We just aren't likely seeing a lot of the shoot downs as they are either in Russia or deep in Russian held territory in the east. (in fact if you read the reports from Ukraine itself it even says the shoot downs are largely over Russian controlled regions).

*Edit:  For clarity I'm suggesting a SMALL (10-15%) error rate for UA aircraft reports as opposed to the 50% to 90% rate that others seem to be onside with.*",1648590714.0,1648588725.0,t3_tqolwd,t3_tqolwd,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

The area consistent with reports of units moving out.  These sort of units would be the ones you'd want being the tip of the spear on leading an offensive, and not ones being bogged down in defensive warfare.  Their gear and armor is thin skinned but fast, ideal for making break throughs.  So I think it makes a lot of sense why they'd be pulled out of a zone that has lost all offensive potential.  That being said, I really doubt they'd be anymore effective in the south where many arm chair generals like myself have been saying they're going.  Could they exploit a break through?  Maybe, but their BMP 4's and BTR's are tin can's that any TDF force can pop open with a simple RPG-7.

My point is, if Russian forces want to take more of the Donbass, they'll have to be prepared to take just as many casualties as they did at the start of the war and it will come at the expense of an already demoralized VDV group.

This war only exacerbates this.  It's also not unreasonable to think there are not a lot of people volunteering and signing on as a contract soldier since the invasion. 

Putin/Shoigu either has to:

* Prevent 'conscripts' (pressed into contract) or contract soldiers from expiring their military service and forcing them to stay on.
* And/or scrape the barrel so to speak, and remove the existing exemptions and by blocking people that haven't served from going abroad.

The US even managed to partially wrangle Iraq as being somehow involved with 9/11, in order to partially justify another invasion and occupation for 15 or so years.

Ukraine has sustained likely 3x civilian deaths at least so far, and a larger amount of soldier deaths. Many more injured, and millions more displaced. This is happening in the West, which, as shitty as it sounds, makes it even more shocking since most of the adjacent powers are nuclear, have the most advanced economies, and have got the newest generation weaponry.

Yet, Russia has the balls to complain about NATO involvement and sanctions, and they are threatening the use of nukes.

Russia is going to be kept in economic ruin and isolation as long as they continue to occupy any lands beyond what was taken in 2014. Eventually, Ukraine will take it all back as the unending supplies from the West persists. 

It’ll be Ukraine’s choice to give up pre-invasion territories that were lost in 2014, but only in exchange for EU and/or NATO membership. That’ll be the price. 

So in the end, Russia’s gamble to takeover Ukraine has upended their own economy, their international standing, and their men, in order to further solidify their hold over Crimea and eastern Donbass, which was never in jeopardy to begin with. Are those territories worth it? They’ll never be able to develop those oil and gas reserves in eastern Ukraine and
Black Sea in time to recoup some of their losses, especially now that the West is shutting the door on Russian energy.

If it was inevitable that Ukraine would join the EU and/or NATO if Russia hadn’t taken over, then it’s even more inevitable now.

It’s laughable that Russia thinks they’ll hold anything gained from this invasion so far. They will not capture any more cities, and they’ll start losing any ones they’ve captured so far during this invasion. Mariupol and Kherson will return to Ukraine sooner rather than later. Mariupol is rubble, why would Russians bleed for it? Kherson is on the north side of the river, totally exposed and without defensive depths.

Give Ukraine enough time to accrue more infantry reserves and weaponry, and they’ll retake eastern Donbass regions. Especially now that the eastern Donbass civilians were rounded up to be used as cannon fodder, I’m sure that won’t backfire…

This article is stricter than article 5 of the NATO agreement. I am not sure why this hasn’t been addressed before (or highlighted in the conversation between the two countries)?

Edit1: I just realized maybe it’s because joining the EU can take years? Not sure about how long it would take to join NATO.

Edit2: put an additional question mark in there because I was wondering and not stating. People get offended easily I guess.

From the NSD, the funds are due to be distributed to investors.

So, this will be a big problem with any agreement. Many other nations (nuclear powers) are going to need to be tied to it.

Now, this is what I think is the best chance for peace right now. I know, people won't like it because it involves Ukraine ceding ground, but just my opinion.

Let Russia have Donbas and Crimea - but not for free, because Russia has illegally taken them and invaded their nation and destroyed it.

These areas contain many ethnic Russians and others that have been subjected to Russian propaganda for years. I think it is pretty unrealistic for Ukraine to be able to control these areas and keep them stable any time soon. It's also incredibly unrealistic for Russia to ever give them up. Yes, Russia, is getting it's butt kicked in many ways, but the average Russian will get pretty pissed if they have to give up Crimea. You'll see Russians rally to support the war effort to keep it. Russia taking Crimea was very popular in Russia at the time.

So again, Russia has to pay for the war damages and illegally stealing Ukraine's land. So, if I'm a Ukrainian negotiator (or Russian negotiator for that matter), I would start throwing out some numbers that make everyone happy (hundreds of billions). Give Ukraine enough to rebuild, Ukraine makes no other concessions other than not to join Nato, which they have already said. Russia gets to keep the sh!thole regions they stole. Even though the ruble is down, they have a lot of gold (supposedly). If Russia doesn't agree, keep pounding the crap out of them.

Sorry for the ramble. Just my take since I do not think it's realistic for Ukraine to manage Crimea or Donbas well after all the damage Russia has done to it. Again, not saying I would give it to him. I would make sure it cost him plenty.",False,1648586575.0,t3_tqolwd,t3_tqolwd,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

*(probability level: fanfic)*

Based upon first rumours from negotiations ... Minor Russian demands fixed (neutrality stuff, allowed to join EU, dropped 'denazification' etc). Major stuff was territories. One rumour said

1. Crimea business: put on hold 15 years
2. Donbas business: put on hold indefinitely

Initially, this sounds strange: Ukraine not likely to give away an inch of territory. But ... let's say this is one result. Then,

1. Fighting stops
2. Sanctions doesn't stop until Crimea/Donbas resolved

Sanctions are hitting hard. Not primarily in money, but in what Russia can import etc. We have now understood that Russia basically can't produce anything complicated without importing Western tech; and for normal people, a very wide range of consumer goods, from iPhones to cars to sugar, disappears.

Given that these first somewhat strange rumours are true, it is possible to set it up so that Ukraine can let Russia slowly strangle itself, and avoid fighting.

Fighting has been neccessary - but definitely costs civilian lives, lives of military personell, military equipment, civilian buildings, infrastructure; huge refugee crisis; problems with the enormous agriculture sector ... etc.

And, while Ukraine has lots of top motivated soldiers, it lacks heavier weapons: tanks, artillery, airplanes, heavy missiles ... stuff that's needed to break through highly fortified defences. 

An option could be to seemingly negotiate a peace where important principles were agreed upon (can join EU; security guaranteed by Germany etc.), and territorial questions postphoned ... and then let Russia slowly strangle themselves until they agree upon territorial issues.

Ukraine and Russia will probably come to a settlement at some point.

Then Ukraine will take that agreement to the West and can basically blackmail them with public opinion (if you don't agree to this, you are killing Ukrainians).

While I have no real problems with security guarantees (although those started ww1), I quite frankly have a potential problem with the West paying for the rebuilding of Ukraine (with EU money) and the lifting of sanctions, at least for as long as Putin stays in power.

Currently the war is unsustainable for Russia. Mounting casualties, fronts stalled or being pushed back. What would change the calculations in this conflict? Chemical weapons or worse a nuclear warhead. 

Understand that not every nuclear weapon is a Tsar Bomba. Russia would not need to level all of Europe or Ukraine. Just one warhead to send a message, at  Kiev to hopefully catch Zelensky off guard, or even Odessa in preparation for a botched naval and amphibious assault. Same for a chemical weapon deployment of a weapon like anthrax or novichok. 

What has been the presumed red lines up to this point? For months , the world watch Russia amass the largest invasion force since WWII. The world stood by, arguing which sanctions to flip like a light switch while military targets were prosecuted. When it became apparent that civilians were being deliberately targeted, no change in official dialogue or stationing of reaction forces could be noted. Why would one bomb change the West’s reticence to launch the world into a global war?

At the end of the day, what I’m saying is that we the western world talk a big talk about “severe retaliation in the event of a nuclear weapon or chemical weapon use” but at the end of the day it’s all talk. No one will escalate the conflict to a global nuclear war. If Russia drops one large bomb on a key city, the world will be angry but no bombers will fly over Moscow and over the known nuclear missile launch sites. The 82nd Airborne will not land in St Petersburg. China, India, Hungary, Brazil, and other Russian friendly nations will not believe that it was Russia who did it but listen to the disinformation campaign that it was the supposed US biological labs housing weapons in Ukraine.

Whenever you encounter something like [a], it's important **not** to convince yourself that they are just a nutcase. When you can't even find a sliver of common ground to understand what your adversary remotely talking about it is **always a mistake** to label them crazy.^[c] 

In fact, from time it is **critical** to ask: 

[Are we the baddies?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JOpPNra4bw).
In **this** case, no. 

But deep beneath that Chinese grade-a bunkum is a tiny nugget of truth. NATO didn't invade anybody, and NATO is not a real threat -- certainly the way Emperor Puputine thinks it is. But NATO has a hand in this. 

This is a pretty brilliant dictator trap play, maybe the most ambitious one in world history. It coincides the insatiable will of Ukraine to choose their own destiny free from the klepto-facist menace next door. And so shall it be, I hope.

But we should not delude ourselves with our own, more nuanced propaganda. This war is **nobody's fault** except Vladimir Putin's. **Period. End Of Story.**  But NATO, the EU - these **free associations of free countries** acting in concert - had a tiny little Trump baby-sized hand in the prologue to this story. To deny this **fact** is indeed *balderdash*.

(1,2) Lifting of recent sanctions

(1,2) Ukraine cannot join NATO

(3,4,5) Keeping the southern coastal landbridge that includes Melitopol, Berdyansk, and Mariupol, but unofficially

(3,4,5) Keeping new territory in eastern Donbass region taken during current conflict

(3,4,5) Water supply restored to Crimea

(6,7,8,9) Official recognition of Crimea

(6,7,8,9) Official recognition of eastern Donbass region based upon borders beyond 2014, based upon current conflict

(6,7,8,9) Official recognition of eastern Donbass region based upon 2014 borders

(9,10) The remains of Ukraine cannot join EU

(9,10) Lifting all sanctions

How far down Russia goes down this list depends where the boundaries are when the deal is inked.

As long as the recent sanctions exist and if Ukraine can still join NATO, or until Putin is overthrown, Russia will likely keep bombing Ukraine and tossing cannon fodder at Ukrainian cities no matter how badly the war effort is going.

So Ukraine will likely give up on NATO, and the West may lift some or all of the recent sanctions depending how much damage Russia is still able to inflict upon Ukraine should the conflict continue.

If Ukraine cannot retake recently conquered territories in the east and south, then they'll only be returned to Ukraine in exchange for restored water to Crimea, and/or official recognition of any or all of the conquered territories since 2014.

If Russia actually gains considerable territory in eastern Ukraine with their new strategy, then I can see Ukraine only gaining back those lands if they renounce EU and persuade the West to lift all the sanctions. To be honest, I doubt the West would agree to these terms. In this scenario, Ukraine will be a 2-state nation, and we enter Cold War 2.0.

Ukraine will regain everything lost during this conflict, and get into NATO, if they fight on, which they might choose to do with enough assurances from the West that they'll continue their support in the war effort, and for assistance to rebuild. If the West has granted them those assurances, then Ukraine might perhaps think it is worthwhile to fight on if it means NATO membership and regaining lost territory.

Unlike the US which could support a blood fruitless campaign in abroad in Vietnam, Russia cannot. If the US couldn't prevail in Vietnam, Russia won't prevail in Ukraine.

The questions then becomes how much human cost is Ukraine willing to stomach in order to achieve NATO membership and regain recently lost territory, and will Russia use a nuke if Putin feels like his reign is threatened if he doesn't gain something materially from this conflict?

For now, Russia will try to convert as many cities into the rubble of Mariupol as they can, while they try to make meaningful gains in the east and south. The gains in the north that they have are strategically meaningless in the long-run... The east matters more, and the south matters the most. Nevertheless, I think they'll lose all recent gains if Ukraine decides to grind it out.",1648591633.0,1648591394.0,t3_tqolwd,t3_tqolwd,,0,-24,0,-24,0,0,

But when you think about it... its eerie how much alike it is to real events.

This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.

Expelling diplomats to me suggests intelligence employees working under official cover in Russian embassies. They were likely known to western intel and, as you note, being watched for counterintel purposes to track down and expose real espionage (industrial spies, informants, etc).

If the officers themselves were exposed, then they'd burn their networks and depart (either on their own, or getting expelled), and all of those spies will go underground until a new case officer makes contact. This may have disrupted a lot of ongoing investigations and made many spies harder to find. In exchange, they get a massive temporary disruption to Russian spy networks.

That can be good or bad. Intelligence can mean theft of valuable secrets, or info on troop or material movement, or opportunities to sabotage. And denying those opportunities to your adversary is useful. However, it can also have peaceful purposes, such as getting clarity on how your adversary is making decisions, which can inform foreign policy to prevent dangerous misunderstandings (such a during an active war).

1. Forces Ukraine to keep many troops in the north. 

2. The ground is just bargaining chips for later.

3. Still gives RU a chance to go for Kyiv later if they somehow manage to turn things around (which seems unlikely but is not totally impossible). 

So what about those troops leaving? We saw today it was VDV units leaving. Well we know they got smashed the hardest and took worst losses. They are going back to rest, and try to refit and replenish as much as they can. This was normal in large wars. 

This was what analysts said starting over the weekend. Today Russia basically admitted that’s what’s happening but lots of people took that to mean they are leaving northern Ukraine. Then they saw VDV troops leaving the north and that confirmed their thoughts. Russia never said it was leaving the area. Russia can claim they are removing troops in good negotiating faith and halted in good faith but it’s apparent they are gurgling to defend, let alone attack and they have to pull toasted units back.

This is not necessarily a good thing; most of these agents aren't sleeper-cell super soldiers. They're intelligence officers and analysts working out of embassies and other legitimate government missions under the guise of their official cover (e.g. ""cultural attaché"", ""Deputy energy minister"", whatever). More likely than not, these individuals were already under surveillance by western counter-intelligence. They use that surveillance to find spies engaged in actual tradecraft (industrial espionage, managing informants, etc). Or to turn them as double agents.

Revealing their identities publicly, as Ukraine did, doesn't out them as criminals subject to arrest for espionage. But it does mean that they can be *certain* they are under surveillance, rather than simply assuming so and taking routine precautions to protect their communications and meetings. That certainty means they can't effectively operate, which means they will burn their networks, letting spies slink back into non-official cover until they can be contacted by a new case officer. 

Their expulsion becomes a mere formality for the host country to express their displeasure and indignation at being spied on (even though everyone does it to everyone else all the time anyway).

EDIT: Here's to clarify:. One if the priorities of the Obama administration was to try to get Europe off of Russian gas reliance by bolstering Ukrainian production, which had just gone through their own turmoil and had elected a leader that, while not explicitly pro-western, was more favourable to deal with than the corrupt goons that preceded him.  To that end, Biden's son (speculation on my part) was tasked with providing legal advice, connections, and influence to try and build up the Burisma as a direct challenge to the Russian stranglehold Gazprom had on eastern Europe at the time.  Putin's response was to shed light on corruption within Burisma, specifically directed at its executive, Mykola Zlochevsky, and try to ensnare the democratic hopeful's son as being somehow involved.  This attempt was aided somewhat by Drumpf but Putin underestimated both Zelensky and US beuracracy and his tool ended up ensnared in a scandal of his own that most likely required Putin to have to pull out all the stops in order to keep his puppet in a position of power.  Its not really surprising to me that this conspiracy with Hunter became such a comical focal point in the election misinformation effort by Putin.  Despite everything, Hunter did somewhat manage to stay clean in the middle of all the crossfire despite all of the pressure and attempts at blackmail and coercion that came into play.  Zelensky's refusal to play into Drumpf's game was a major sign to the US that he could be trusted, and that some of his reforms were actually being effective.  This development was probably what sparked so much of Putin's animosity towards the new government in Ukraine, as they were finally flexing some independence from Moscow and acting less like a puppet state and more like a sovereign nation.",1648561072.0,1648559121.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2k4xrf,,1,-20,0,-20,0,0,

Regime change, especially with a nuclear power, is a dangerous process. It was economic liberalisation that built this crisis of inequality in Russia. Further impoverishing the common folk does nothing to address that. There can't just be regime change, there has to be political change, that redistributes the wealth of oligarchs, that bars the power of military generals and oligarchs from interfering in the political process.

Actually, this sounds pretty good. ""Freezing"" means Ukraine does not have to recognize those republics in exchange for having peace now. Remember, time works in Ukraine's favor, especially if the sanctions will be kept. Putin's regime may be holding on for now but it is not sustainable for much longer in these circumstances.

* War ends.

* Russian troops withdraw.

* Ukraine can start rebuilding with lots of help from international community.

* Ukraine joins EU.

It is true that Russia has and will have huge resupply problems - especially if they cannot get their huge storage of vehicles etc to work (let's hope they cannot), eg if they haven't been maintained or have been used already for spare parts etc. 

That said - IF UKR and RUS reach some kind of a peace treaty then you can be sure that there will be an easing of sanctions and there will be some countries/companies that will rush back to Russia. We shouldn't also discount China, India etc from giving Russia what they need, albeit they cannot cover what Russia has lost to Western sanctions in a few short weeks or months, possibly even years. 

But what lots of people here seem not to know, or disregard, is that the Russian mentality - the average Russian person's mentality - is a whole different deal than that of a German, American, French etc. We here think that they will raise up against Putin for everything he has done. Chances are that no, they actually won't. Partly because of brainwashing, partly because of fear, partly because they will rally around Putin as a dear leader. Russian people are willing to suffer A LOT for their country, especially the Putin voter-base (who most likely are not the ones who have been escaping from Russia), so to think that they aren't willing to suffer if Putin will tell them that they have to suffer because Russia is in a war against the west and everybody has to cinch their belts so they could focus on the war machine and war machine only? Yeah, they will - gladly. Think of all the news they've been told for 8 years about Ukraine. After 1 month of fighting, they will accept that RUS needed to peace with UKR? Never - they'd rather eat bread with sawdust if necessary. 

An alarming example should be the Chechen wars, where the first war ended with a peace (where Russia suffered pretty badly and barely managed to win, which was more like a stalemate in the end AFAIK), and then a few years later, the Russians just obliterated Chechnya. Why oh why should they let Ukraine have a go at it?

Nah. Maybe I'm too cynical just like you, but I live next to Russia, I don't believe a word that comes out of their mouths. They're up to something and chances are that if Ukraine secedes Donbas/Crimea to them (and possibly Mariupol), they won't ever get these areas back.

For the forseeable I think Russia will try and secure what it has, that is the Crimea and the two breakaway republics, and focus on winning the cities and towns near the UA/Russian border possibly targeting Odesa in order to control the Black Sea coast and deny Ukraine access to maritime trade routes. 

They'll get around having their arses kicked in western Ukraine by unilaterally declaring victory on that front and maybe by denying that they were ever really targets in the first place.

The real question becomes “what does Russia do after this event?” 

If Russia reforms and fixes the issues with its military, then they could absolutely be capable of doing this again, even again in Ukraine, and perhaps even in a non-NATO aligned country, and with a little time,
 and rebuilding and reform, they could potentially see some “success”.

All of this hinges on how their invasion of Ukraine goes, how well the rest of the world adheres to sanctions and to keeping them accountable, and whether Russians grow weary enough of receiving their loved ones in bags of various sizes.

My personal feeling is that not only will there be lesser appetite for this when the war is over, but the not-so-insignificant increase in military spending and capabilities in European nations will considerably out compete Russia’s ability to reform and rebuild its own military, and would make the prospect of more Russian imperialism an utterly dire one.",False,1648549759.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2jotyz,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

I don't think they can though, leaving Kyiv unprotected would be extremely dangerous.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, you are correct, UKR's forces would have a lot more freedom of movement and as they would also have the support of the local population they can advance faster than Russian troops

&#x200B;

The point is: It seems like the battle for Kyiv is won, the battle for eastern and southern   
Ukraine is sadly far from over. Then again, Ukraine has shown such fighting spirit that I am at least willing to hope that they really can win this war, which I would have never guessed when Russia started the invasion. The best hope is still that someone in Russia decides to end this shitshow by putting a bullet in Putin's head and then retreating claiming, that this was all Putin's idea and how happy everyone is that this maniac is dead. (I don't believe that would happen, but it would be the fastest and easiest way out)

The most important point is: As Ukraine's government has pointed out, Russia can't be allowed to get a single inch of Ukraine's territory.

While on the defensive in the north, they can threaten Kiev and keep large numbers of Ukrainian forces tied down there.

b) Many aircraft depend on parts no longer mass produced since fall of the USSR so maintenance is sketchy.

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Physical gas flows through the Yamal-Europe pipeline at Germany's Mallnow point fell to zero on Tuesday afternoon, data from operator Gascade showed, while Russian gas deliveries to Europe on the other two key pipeline routes were broadly steady.

Eastbound flows into Poland from Germany along the Yamal-Europe pipeline at the Mallnow border point last stood at 1,451,155 kWh/h by 1300 local time (1100 GMT) but since then it has fallen to zero, data from operator Gascade showed.

The usually westbound pipeline reversed on March 15 as nominations to ship gas into Germany fell to zero, while Polish customers bought gas from Germany. read more

Gascade did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Russia said it would work out practical arrangements by Thursday for foreign companies to pay for its gas in roubles, raising the probability of supply disruptions as Western nations have so far rejected Moscow's demand for a currency switch.[nL5N2VW2RA

However, flows to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline across the Baltic Sea last stood at 73,389,870 kilowatt hours per hour (kWh/h), little changed from the previous 24 hours.

Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has booked some westbound gas transit capacity via the Yamal-Europe pipeline for Tuesday night and for Wednesday, Interfax news agency reported, citing auction results.

The actual flows are not guaranteed because Gazprom does not always use booked capacity.

 >The Kurganets-25 (Russian: Курганец-25) is a tracked, 25-ton modular infantry fighting vehicle and armored personnel carrier being developed for the Russian Army. The Kurganets-25 will evolve into various models, gradually replacing BMP, BMD, MT-LB and other types of tracked Soviet armored platforms. The Kurganets-25 will have modular armor that can be upgraded for specific threats. The Kurganets-25 IFV and APC variants were first seen in public (initially with the turret and main armament shrouded) during rehearsals for the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade.

- The Russian government's position on nearly every aspect of this conflict is largely known to us at this point, as is NATO's, as are many constituent members of NATO's.    
- A week ago UA's government put a gag order on many specific kinds of video and text related to social media where sensitive information could be revealed, which they probably should have done earlier.  People don't usually know what they're posting is sensitive until it's too late.  
- Fog of war.  
- With Russia's redistribution of forces, the majority of the fronts in UA are 'fluid' right now, with towns being occupied only nominally in that the other force isn't currently present.  It doesn't necessarily imply the town is liberated, because UA could just be moving through it without leaving behind defense.  And then there other areas which really had no business being reported at all.  Example:  Russia can claim (correctly) it holds Izyum, because it holds a majority of it, but it doesn't hold the important southern section below the river.  So reporting 'Russia holds Izyum' is wrong, and reporting 'Ukraine holds Izyum' is wrong.  Reporting 'Izyum contested' is also wrong, because that situation is currently defensive on both sides.

See, fact of the matter is the worse this is going for Russia the less western nations see a direct intervention as necessary. As things are going, Ukraine won't lose.

The red line was always NATO. Maybe WMD use. It was never ""invade Ukraine"" because if it was Ukraine wouldn't have bothered trying to join NATO in the first place. That's the point.

Now, things that should be done? Give Ukraine planes. Give Ukraine tanks. Give them whatever equipment they damn well ask for.

But, an intervention at this point? Risk-reward isn't there.

Status-quo likely best case: Ukraine wins with western equipment support, gets its pre-feb borders and probably gets security guarantees from the countries they say have promised as much in the deal. They get to join the EU, and they have tons of money dumped in for rebuilding from the west as well as commericial investment since the security guarantees now open them up as a safe place for doing business. Russia is humiliated, but they can spin some things internally as ""success"" with propaganda.

Lots more people die on the way to that result, unfortunately.

Status-quo likeliest worst-case: Russia takes Donbas, forces a treaty, Ukraine gets everything in the previous scenario, but the lost territory is lost for good.

Absolute worst-case: Putin is so humiliated he uses a nuke on Ukraine. Not likely since the risk-reward for doing so is too high, he'd completely alienate and humiliate his own country *at minimum* if not outright cause NATO to respond militarily. All sanctions remain in place and then some at minimum.

Nato intervention best case:  Putin doesn't respond to getting absolutely slaughtered by NATO forces with nukes, Ukraine regains all lost territory including Crimea and Donbas, and a lot less Ukrainians die.

NATO intervention worst case: The Russian playbook of [escalate to deescalate](https://globalsecurityreview.com/nuclear-de-escalation-russias-deterrence-strategy/) gets brought into play, nukes start getting used, things escalate to strategic nukes, end of civilization as well as Ukraine.

Belarus is forced by Putin to send in troops, the same troops go over to the Ukrainian side and turn right around back to Belarus and depose Lukashenko.

An internal coup of higher military officers arrests Putin and puts Russia under martial law. They offer to withdraw all russian forces from all of Ukraine against promises that all sanctions are removed. The west refuses, and a vast popular uprising in Russia against the new rulers leads to an eventual democratic election after a brief civil war against parts of the armed forces hardliners. The russian armed forces are mostly left broken, and now the sanctions *are* removed.

The realistic scenario; Russia has to agree to popular vote in both Donbas and Crimea, against a Ukrainian ""neutrality"", where Ukraines security is in fact secured by hard article 5 style guarantees from Germany, Turkey, France, The UK and the US.

Edit: To clarify, Russia has far more capability in the east and south than they do everywhere else in Ukraine, so while Russia’s ability to invade any further is extremely minimal, their ability to hold territory near their border and the sea is generally very good, and without Ukraine receiving more jets, tanks, AA, EW equipment, and long range artillery, it might be much more difficult taking back Donbas and the south in general than one might think from Russia’s recent performance.",1648551022.0,1648550723.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2jq004,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

&#x200B;

From the perspective of Ukraine, there are a few hard lines imo.

\- Ukraine must be sovereign

\- Ukraine, through some means, must have security guarantees that Russian will not or cannot cross the border again

\- Ukraine cannot be completely economically crippled, either through the damages of war or the inability to develop their own industry in the future

&#x200B;

There are also a couple things that, while not a strict hard line, will be very difficult for Ukraine to convince the public to accept due to the understandable massive increase in nationalism. Mainly, it will be very difficult to accept the loss of land.

&#x200B;

On the topics related to security and sovereignty, I think what this article says, if it is true, is an acceptable position for Ukraine: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/03/28/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-russia-willing-to-let-ukraine-join-eu-if-it-stays-out-of-nato-report-says/?sh=152a0b6c7235](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joewalsh/2022/03/28/russia-ukraine-peace-talks-russia-willing-to-let-ukraine-join-eu-if-it-stays-out-of-nato-report-says/?sh=152a0b6c7235) It gives Russia the domestic sell of ""no nato in Ukraine"" while letting Ukraine get security guarantees and a future EU accession. Assuming some of those guarantees exist as part of signing the peace treaty already, specifically from the US, this seems an acceptable position.

On topics of land, this is the hardest topic. It has two issues - the land itself, and economic aspects related to it. Crimea and Donbas both contain major oil and gas reserves that Ukraine wanted to develop before 2014 when Russia fucked that up. It will be very difficult for Ukraine to sell any loss of land at all, especially anything before the pre-February lines. It will also be virtually impossible to accept any kind of joint administration of Crimea/Donbas, as that gives Russia the ability to leak influence into Ukraine through that. It's easy to say ""They can't concede any land period"" and while that is a reasonable position from the western geopolitical position that wants to see Russia thoroughly punished for this to prevent it happening again, that may not be a functional position from Ukraine's perspective. Honestly, I don't know what deal can be made here that Ukraine and Russia can both tolerate.",False,1648559787.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2k4v2z,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

That is, someone who's actually legally obligated to assist them militarily in the event of another invasion. Not sure Russia will be a great deal happier with that?

- Demilitarization - Probably the single most unacceptable idea IMO, even more so than territorial concessions. Ukraine is not going to accept making themselves *more* vulnerable to a future invasion or more reliant on foreign assistance after the trauma and damage of this one. And there's no point in ending a war with ""peace"" just to make yourself far more vulnerable for when they invade again in a few years.

- Elections - Can't see a point there. Russian/pro-Russian candidates will obviously lose even harder now in a fair election, and I'm sure Ukraine would insist on EU/credible monitors and assistance, so why would Moscow want that?

- Territory - I don't think anything beyond the 2/23 line of contact is up for negotiation. I *could* see it as plausible that they cede Crimea or are willing to leave it as de facto Russian-owned. That's not me saying they *should*, just that it's the most plausible.

Neither side wants that, I'm sure.

If they for some reason *must* make concessions, I've had a couple of thoughts.

They *could* allow the currently occupied areas of Donbas and annexed Crimea a status as autonomous regions, given that they are to be fully returned to Ukraine, without further meddling in politics or military support from Russia. In practical terms they'll pay their taxes to Ukraine, have Ukrainian passports etc., and Ukraine will be responsible for border control/defence, but beyond that they can mostly govern themselves *if they so wish*. A referendum, observed and approved by international observers, would of course be the first crucial step towards such a deal.

As far as Ukraine as a whole goes, I think this whole war (with the military ineptitude of the Russians) has shown us that they don't necessarily need to be a NATO member to be secure. They'd be more than secure enough by entering an alliance with a select few of their neighboring countries, such as (and most notably) Poland and Turkey. That is, of course, a bit of a double edged sword, what with those countries both having authoritarian governments that could easily flip back towards a more Russia-friendly stance. It would have to be a slightly broader alliance, and not just those two countries.

Everyone knows Ukraine doesn't have nuclear weapons, if one goes off in Ukraine it is clearly one side using them. Good luck lying about that. 

Chemical weapons I can see unfortunately. They keep pretending Ukraine has them for a reason, they'll use it and then claim it was the Ukrainians. It'll be a bad lie but for people desperate for a reason to not hate their government a bad lie is just as good as a believable one. And at this point all of this, *all of it*, is about Putin's domestic political survival. The only realistic goal I can see them achieving now is essentially a status quo that already existed. They have Donbass and Crimea. Okay, they also had it for the past 8 years. So what did they gain? Nothing. Probably also why Ukraine is even willing to negotiate the status of those territories, because it's been almost a decade and they are de facto Russia at this point anyway. 

That said if they used a chemical weapon in Kyiv the reaction would be worse for them then any potential military gain. Using that shit on a city like Kyiv is basically committing a genocide in full view of the entire world and its media. I honestly think that's when NATO sends in ""peacekeepers"".

A ship sinking after following random small speedboats right up on the shore and getting hit by MLRS (which are not know for pinpoint accuracy) was never believed by anyone who has an education in warfare and it went against common sense. 

The planes were shot down in what would have been the largest and bloodiest combat jump since WW2. But we saw no photos or videos of RU troops in SE Kyiv where this took place. No parachutes. No downed planes. Keep in mind this was super far behind enemy lines and even the RU knew they had little chance to get there fast at that point. And keep in mind massive slow low flying planes would be fairly easy targets for modern AA. It was pure fantasy. 

The choppers did happen but it wasn’t close to 30. I think they counted in the mid teens either hit or closer to 10. I can’t never now. Big win for Ukraine. 

What happens is that first the information environment is dominated by Ukraine. Everyone is rooting for them. So someone posts that large Russian planes full of 50–100 men got shot down. Everyone RTs it because it’s good for Ukraine. People want Ukraine to win, they don’t want the truth. So rumors get spread by people who have no real interest in finding if it’s true first and who have no education or real interest in military history/art of warfare. Then it snowballs.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Best estimates I've seen is that the Russians had about 17-1800 tanks committed to the Ukraine invasion and have now committed around 2K total with their reinforcements. They MIGHT have an additional 2K they can call upon over the next 3-6 months and maybe another 2K that are salvageable in the long-term.  Some estimates have around 6-8K of their tank fleet is just rusting hulks that need a ton of work to be useful.

Ukraine meanwhile has about 6-800 of their own that are in working condition from what I've read.  Ukraine has the same issues as Russia.  Many of their old tanks are just shit-tier T-72s with a bit of reactive armour stapled on. 

Both services lack experienced tank and repair crews.  That is likely the bigger challenge.  Even if Russia manages to bring in their old tanks, they need to fix them, train crews, and get them to the front lines in a reasonable time.

As a result, they rarely train in large formations, and are rarely used in large formations, so the Russians aren't able to mass force against Ukrainian aircraft or anti-air systems.

2) Russia has a limited number of planes capable of using precision guided munitions, a limited number of pilots capable of using them, and limited supplies of them. As a result, it's harder for them to target Ukrainian anti-air systems.

3) Because of the lack of precision guided munitions, and the awful weather this time of year in Ukraine, Russian pilots were having to fly closer to the ground to see/hit targets, making them vulnerable to Stingers and other lower-altitude anti-air systems.

Reinforcing push from Crimea would mean supporting their most successful axis so far. However they depend on one rail head in the south which has been shown to be very vulnerable to Ukrainean interdiction. Piling troops there would make the supply situation worse. Mariopol is ruined as a rail and road junction so supply from the east would be problematic. Pushing north from this are would make for crazy exposed supply lines. At best they can try to hold east of Kherson until Ukraineans muster up enough mass to dislodge them. Keeping a Russian force in supply on the western bank of the Dniepr would be highly unlikely. 

The Russians don't have the ships, the troops or the know how to perform an opposed landing anywhere in the south, so Odessa is out. Transnistria does not have an airport and no direct land line to Russia so reinforcing there is out of the question unless Moldova decides for some strange reason to allow a Russian air bridge through Chisinau. 

Most likely the best supply situation would be in the Donbas, if they reduce the axis of operations to only pushing their area of control further west. That also means they need to just push against the JFO using mass alone  and give up any hope to encircle them as they can't sustain a push towards the million people strong road and rail junction of Dnipro.

An unsupported naval landing against a well-prepared and well-armed enemy, which then has you going *directly* into urban warfare if you do make it to shore, is utterly suicidal. So landing *in* Odesa seems absurd.

The geography around Odesa makes it difficult to successfully do some kind of ""land outside the city and then move in"" tactic, either - look at the way the rivers/waterways are lined up. There's numerous narrow chokepoints. 

I'd also be shocked if Ukraine doesn't have missiles and artillery pre-sighted in on the mouth of the Dniester and beaches near Odesa.

47cebd9d28d1be1cdb0ad6df31b5842d,tqolwd,i2itz9x,"First off it is impossible to know what the Russian public truly believes. They know better than to speak out against Putin. They also know not to go listening or talking to people from the West [(see the Russian foreign agent law)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_foreign_agent_law). Also, the older demographic does tend to believe what they are told by the Kremlin controlled TV. You'll also have people who are naturally pro-Putin who want a return to the Soviet era when they where better off materially speaking. 

> How does one call out to their inner humanity?

You cannot. Not in the way people seem to believe would end the war. The idea of the public rising up against Putin is *highly* unlikely to happen for many reasons, such as those listed above for starters. I get why people hope for an uprising or revolution, but we shouldn't pin our hopes on it. It speaks volumes when the only end people see to this war is for a revolution.  

The problem isn't speaking to their humanity. The problem is you have no way of combatting the propaganda. They're also unlikely to trust the people in the West over their own people. There's a whole history of mistrust between Russia and America. Just look at the Cold War. The West also mistrusted the Russians. They where painted as bad guys and henchmen in films and TV shows. The Russians will think we don't understand them and their culture, and to be honest they're probably right. To learn more about Putin and make some sense of this whole mess I had to watch interviews and articles with experts on Russia and Putin. I'm still definitely no expert and never will be, but this was the only way I could get inside Putin's head and see what makes him tick. That and learning about other dictators.  

You have to remember that to the Russian public they believe they're fighting actual Nazis again and are liberating people just like themselves. It's World War 2 all over again for them but on a small scale. The Russian people will suffer many great hardships in that battle. They must think the West and America are evil for siding with Nazis.  

After saying all that I'd like to point out that no, I'm not pro-Putin.  
Feel free to go through my comment history and you'll see I recommend people watch interviews with Julia Ioffe, Garry Kasparov, James Clapper and a CIA agent whose name escapes me. All of those interviews are available on Youtube. The interviews with Julia Ioffe and James Clapper are part of The Putin Files (2017) and Julia gave another interview for Putin's Road to War (2022), both of which are by PBS Frontline.  

My whole point is to show what the Russians are thinking and why it would be next to impossible to get through to them. They're in a war! You're going to find it hard to get a population to change their view of reality during a war just like that.  

I am reminded of a German who gave an interview about his time as a sailor on a U-boat during WW2. He believed, like most other people, what the Nazis told them. Namely, that Germany was defending itself after Britain started the unprovoked war by attacking Germany. It was only after the war ended that he learnt the truth. It was a hell of a shock to him.  

Getting through to the soldiers will be difficult. I know some have given themselves up, but what would happen if the Russian army captured them? Troops tend to be taught to follow orders no matter what and to follow the chain of command. They're taught that their lives depend upon each other obeying orders. They're risking a lot to give themselves up.  

It is a complex situation. We cannot depend on getting though to the Russian public and for them to revolt against Putin. Those who are protesting are risking a lot as it is. The police are brutal. Yet as Julia Ioffe said, the number of people who are protesting is tiny compared to the size of the population. Plus, you're much more likely to get protests in two of the main cities which have a higher number of people who already dislike Putin.  

May I suggest watching some good documentaries on Russia, Putin and various dictators in history. Those I mentioned by PBS Frontline are excellent, as are other interviews with Julia Ioffe. All are available on Youtube. Reading up on propaganda and also human behaviour may be interesting too.

This is going to wreck havoc on their military projects.

2) Ukraine will come out of this more united and more importantly, with the knowledge they can win a conventional war against Russia. Expect to see massive investments into military equipment, military training, and generally a more well equipped, experienced, and capable force, especially if NATO is off the table.

f0007b5d68acbaa5968e8aa554c98f7f,tqolwd,i2lkzn5,"It might be a bit of clever thinking from Ukraine in a few ways. Reintegrating Crimea was always going to be hard given the facts on the ground.

1. Russia has fully committed to, legally, bringing it into the Russian federation.  Doing so was incredibly popular with Russian people. They will fight hard to retain it and endure a lot of sanctions, deaths, and costs to keep it within Russia.  Even beyond Putin, no Russian politician after him will agree to willingly give it up without facing a huge blowback politically. 

2. Even if Ukraine invades the area and defeats the Russian army. They still have to convince it's residents (80% of whom are apparently ethnically/linguistically Russian) that they are better off in a war torn Ukraine. After that ordeal, you'll still have Russian revanchist politicians in the future to deal with.  It will always be a point of contention, like Alsace-Lorraine.

3. Ukraine also has a challenges.  They can't give up the area either. The Ukrainians will be furious.  No Ukrainian politician will be able to agree to recognize it as part of Russia. Then, even if you get it back by force, you now have an area within you country with a ton of people who might not want to be part of your country anymore. Completely unworkable.

So, Ukraine can't retake it and they can't give it up. Same goes for Russia, even if they wanted sanctions gone, no politician will be willing to give it up either. Here's where the 15 year agreement comes in.  In 15 years, things could be totally different:

1. Russia might be completely toast economically, demographically, politically.  What comes after Putin? Will it be stable? 
2. Ukraine might be part of the EU and have a booming economy by then.  
3. By that point there is also a 80% chance Putin is dead/gone along with the vast majority of his supporters who want to keep Crimea.  His base of support is dying out. 
4. All the losses from the war will be fully felt/known.
5. At that point, Crimeans might be willing to return to Ukraine for economic, social, cultural reasons. Russia might not WANT to return Crimea, but it will become harder and harder to keep it if the Crimeans want to go back to Ukraine. At that point, if Russia hasn't already fallen apart, they will be under intense pressure to hold a legitimate referendum as per whatever accords are signed. 
6. Ukraine also wins because they get to avoid the costly military struggle to re-take it, the ensuing damage, and the political cost of giving it up.  Some politician in 15 years in Ukraine might have to agree with Crimea staying in Russia if they want to stay, but by then, the average Ukrainian might not be worried about losing a piece of land that doesn't want to be part of Ukraine anyway and has be gone for 20+ years.",False,1648579596.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2ldpoh,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

If their nuclear subs are mostly intercepted, the number goes down. 

There are people who are willing to bet the number is even lower, due to the costs of maintenance— the US spends $60B maintaining their nukes, whereas the entire military budget for Russia (before skimming) was $65B. If half made it to where it was actually allotted, that would leave them with a similar budget to Italy, but at 15 times the personnel.

Standing at 1,640 metres (5,381 ft) it is the highest mountain in the Southern Ural section, and is featured within the South Ural Nature Reserve. Yamantau is notable as the subject of claims by the United States that a secret extensive bunker complex of the Russian government or Russian Armed Forces is contained within the mountain, similar to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

I'm fine with folks having differing opinions, but I can't get my head around how those differing opinions are always 'nukes'.  The first three weeks as Putin escalated rhetoric, okay... but now that Russia is backing down I don't see those same people breathing a sigh of relief.  Their fears should be eased and they should be say 'this is a good thing' but it's crickets.

It's a GOOD thing people are thinking about it again because it might apply pressure to resume disarmament efforts and redouble efforts to prevent proliferation which have really flagged in the last 3 decades.  

With that said, Russia and the US aren't nuking each other outside an invasion or first strike by the other side.  As I said everyone knows the math on that.  Use nukes both sides get destroyed.  If you aren't facing complete destruction, then launching nukes just ensures a worse outcome (aka complete destruction).

Precisely BECAUSE the US has been a bit more aggressive with their talk, the talk of nukes from Russia has quieted down, they are now referring folks to their doctrine and taking that threat off the table.

They will have to completely rebuild large parts of their country while also doing a shitton of reforms and fundamentally change a few things about how they do things. That will take a lot of time on their end.

And on the EU end there are a lot of things that need to change as well before they realistically should even consider adding new members. Poland and Hungary are threatening the stability with their ""Putinisation"" of their governments and the EU basically has no real recourse against it because they can always be blackmailed by those governments because you most of the time need an unanimous vote to really change or do things. Before Ukraine can join, odds are high the EU needs to do some reforms as well and change a few things or otherwise it will even get harder for it to function properly. That (if it happens at all) will take a ton of time as well.

So no.

Allowing Ukraine to seek EU membership is not a compromise or solution to anything. Putin knows that very well. Thats why he is probably not ruling it out.

Transnistria does have access to the Black Sea via the Dniester river though, and Russia has enough landing ships in the Black Sea area to move several BTGs per trip, at least if the two more lightly damaged ones are serviceable, so it's not entirely unfeasible. It was just a thought however.

Since they are trying hard to attack the JFO area from the northeastern direction via Kharkiv, notably fighting around Izyum, reinforcements on that front makes sense so as to threaten the JFO forces from behind, so imo that's where the bulk of redeployed ground combat units will go. Ukrainian units in Donbas keep being pushed back, if slowly, so I'm not sure a reinforcement of the Donbas side of the advance is needed for Russia. 

As for munitions, all experts agree that they have no lack of ""dumb bombs"" for their air force even if their supposed stocks of PGMs are about halved, nor do they in any way lack artillery shells, so yes they'd certainly have the capability to ""crater"" a sizable area in the Donbas.

 >The Russian Airborne Forces (Russian: Воздушно-десантные войска России, ВДВ, romanized: Vozdushno-desantnye voyska Rossii, VDV) was a  military branch of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. It was formed in 1992 from units of the Soviet Airborne Forces that came under Russian control following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Troops of the Russian Airborne Forces had traditionally worn a sky blue beret and blue-striped telnyashka undershirt and were called desant (Russian: Десант) from the French Descente. The Russian Airborne Forces were well known for their mobility, utilizing a range of specialist airborne warfare vehicles, and were fully mechanized.
 
**[BMD-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMD-2)** 
 
 >The BMD-2 is a Soviet airborne infantry fighting vehicle, introduced in 1985. It is a variant of BMD-1 with a new turret and some changes done to the hull. BMD stands for Boyevaya Mashina Desanta (Боевая Машина Десанта, which literally translates to ""Airborne Combat Vehicle""). It was developed as a replacement for the BMD-1 but it failed to replace it completely because of the downfall of the Soviet economy in the 1980s.
 
**[Infantry fighting vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_fighting_vehicle)** 
 
 >An infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), also known as a mechanized infantry combat vehicle (MICV), is a type of armoured fighting vehicle used to carry infantry into battle and provide  direct-fire support. The 1990 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe defines an infantry fighting vehicle as ""an armoured combat vehicle which is designed and equipped primarily to transport a combat infantry squad, and which is armed with an integral or organic cannon of at least 20 millimeters calibre and sometimes an antitank missile launcher"". IFVs often serve both as the principal weapons system and as the mode of transport for a mechanized infantry unit.

Russia has one of the largest armies in the world. It just has possibly the worst military leadership and discipline I've ever seen from an actual government. They spent years discreetly selling shit under the table and their soldiers apparently did the same thing.

So they invaded a country armed and trained by the west, during their infamous mud season, with an army that was so riddled with corruption, intelligence leaks, and just general not give a shittery that when push came to shove all they had going for them was their undeniable ability to bomb the shit out of pretty much anything they want.

Indeed, I would believe they're aware that the guy is at the very least highly combative against dissent, and whether or not they think it's justified is irrelevant for this purpose -- they simply will not comment on it or provide a 'friendlier' neutral response even if they believe otherwise.

> The idea of the public rising up against Putin is highly unlikely to happen for many reasons, such as those listed above for starters. I get why people hope for an uprising or revolution, but we shouldn't pin our hopes on it. It speaks volumes when the only end people see to this war is for a revolution.

Likewise, I don't really believe this is achievable. It's wishful thinking at best, and there have been many times were the strange has indeed become reality, but in terms of being practical, this would hardly happen, because we're not even sure if they actually believe they're the aggressors here. Why start a revolution against the West if they're presumed to be the aggressors here, after all?

> The problem isn't speaking to their humanity. The problem is you have no way of combatting the propaganda.

Think it's a bit of both. There are people who understand that there are significant losses of people and wish for it to stop, but even then, suppose you galvanize them to act, there would still be enough propaganda for the remaining people to go against them. And of course, I did say that the West's sanctions, while justified in the greater scheme of things, could be used to further encourage this rift.

> My whole point is to show what the Russians are thinking and why it would be next to impossible to get through to them. They're in a war! You're going to find it hard to get a population to change their view of reality during a war just like that.

Skipping ahead, yes, it's definitely hard to justify to yourself you're the aggressors when if you're involved in it yourself -- sending your kin to fight in a battle, you would be invested in actually winning so you can see your family alive at the end. So many ways for the human psyche to twist that into defending yourself against all aggressors.

 >The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias that assumes that ""people get what they deserve"" – that actions will have morally fair and fitting consequences for the actor. For example, the assumptions that noble actions will eventually be rewarded and evil actions will eventually be punished fall under this hypothesis. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of— either a universal force that restores moral balance or a universal connection between the nature of actions and their results.

I'm saying i thought their numbers purposely included severe damage and not only destroyed.(I could be wrong but that was what I was assuming) I was mostly thinking of the kherson airport situation. Ukraine said they destroyed 10 damaged 20. Everyone called bullshit. 4 days later they hit the airport again and this time there was satellite evidence. Showed something like 15 confirmed hits.. 6 of them were known to be from the previous attack.

I can sadly easily imagine that what happened was that some otherwise useless newbie conscript was brought over and put in charge of moving some munitions around because the experienced handlers were either busy elsewhere or have been slowly siphoned off to help with needs closer to the front. A bit of a slip or some idiotic fooling around and down goes an opened crate...

This is especially likely as one of the things confusing the hell out of logistics people is why Russia has seemingly rolled back their logistical knowledge by over 100 years. There was a publicized study by the US Army in like 1930 that compared the difference between unloading a train car where the cargo had been stored in piles of those two-man-lift container boxes with a handle on either side vs using any form of palletized storage and a forklift (fun fact, the Forklift was invented in 1917). Using a full crew of people in round-the-clock fashion, it took about 3 days to unload the train car. The forklift did it in 3 hours. So the thing driving everyone nuts is ""Where's Russia's crane-trucks and forklifts?"". About 15% of the US military's trucks have integrated cranes so they can offload pallets even if there's no forklifts around (and yes, there are all-terrain military/ruggedized forklifts).

So Russia turns gas/oil/coal/grain/fertilizer supply off on Friday. Germany will have 2-3 months of reserves, then will suddenly have to pay 6x the amount on the spot market than they used to pay. As a consequence, all their mechanical production (cars, machinery etc.) doubles in price. Lack of fertilizer and gas ramps up food and transportation inflation, leading to 2x prices within a year, breaking a social contract in Germany, leading to chaotic riots. To withstand worsened macro-economical parameters, German companies will start  collecting reserves from Eastern EU, shutting down factories and collecting food supplies (this one is already happening), leading to a big recession in that part of the EU. The buffer will only last for ~1 year though and after that Germany plunges into a massive recession itself, taking EU with it.

 >Denazification (German: Entnazifizierung) was an Allied initiative to rid German and Austrian society, culture, press, economy, judiciary, and politics of the Nazi ideology following the Second World War. It was carried out by removing those who had been Nazi Party or SS members from positions of power and influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with Nazism. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the war and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945.

If they think that Putin's victory is inevitable and the West and Ukraine cannot stop him, then why throw their lives and their families lives away? They've lived under his rules for decades where he's got away with everything, so why should now be any different. The West hasn't stopped him in the past, in fact governments and businesses worked with him and treated him as one of their own. Julia interviewed a Russian who said the sanctions don't bother Putin, they're seen as part of the price in dealing with the West. Putin thinks that if they're going to get sanctions anyway, why bother trying to play by the rules?  

They're also taught that the West, particularly America and democracy, are just as corrupt as Russia. So why bother changing when the alternative is just as bad if not worse? The Kremlin have their own corrupt so-called version of democracy called [Sovereign democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_democracy).  

The Kremlin has pro-Putin groups for youths. They even pay pro-Putin counter protesters to show up whenever there's an anti-Putin protest. Julia spoke to one pro-Putin counter protestor and he believed that the anti-Putin protestors where being paid for by America. If he was being paid, then surely they where too. The Russian public know corruption runs so deeply they believe it is everywhere. In fact Russia has been called a mafia state.

You know the situation is dire when for years people who have been reporting on and calling out Putin's actions say the only good news is that Putin is mortal and will die of old age some day. That's the most likely scenario for replacing Putin.  

Russia will fall again when Putin dies. He's make the government incapable of working without him. When he does die, most likely of old age, Putin v.2.0 will take his place. The system which made, and was further shaped by, Putin will still exist. A lot of Russian people, particularly those who remember the fall of the Soviet Union, do not want that to happen again. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer and probably go hungry again.  

I do wonder though, what if a Putin v.2.0, or at least someone as strong as him, doesn't fill the power vacuum? What is the worst case scenario we see in other dictatorships when the tyrant dies? Infighting in such a system as people struggle for power isn't going to be pretty. Would there be terrorism and fighting as the poor go hungry? If that weren't bad enough, it could spill over into neighbouring countries.  

I freely admit that the last idea of what may happen if a Putin v.2.0 doesn't take control isn't something I've seen experts on Russia mention. They all think there will be a continuation of the current system. Julia says it is also possible that the war would continue even if Putin dies as they went through a few leaders before the end of the Russian war in Afghanistan.  

One thing which bothers me is what if Putin just waits? Over time I can see politicians and businesses wanting to drop sanctions or work around them. The lure of power, money and resources is strong. Politicians often loose sight of the bigger picture as they're often too busy fighting amongst themselves. Maybe a sympathetic leader would push for closer ties to Russia again. Businesses may start lobbying politicians so they can get access to Russian resources. I'm sure Putin would also pull a few strings if he could. I wonder if he may fabricate, or at least enhance, problems in other countries so the people and politicians take their eyes off the big picture.",False,1648557797.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2iym9u,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

The Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) deduced from security camera footage that it is led by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); this view is shared by the United States. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike also previously suggested that it may be associated with either the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) or SVR.

The US can't supply fighter jets or advanced equipment simply because there is no one to run it which is why the US has been pushing for Poland and others to supply jets that it can backfill with f35s.  There exists an innate incompatibility between the majority of US armaments and Ukrainian skillsets.  
Here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-on-u-s-security-assistance-for-ukraine/ This is the disclosed assistance. I assure you much more has been provided.

The new $800 million assistance package includes:

800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;
2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems;
100 Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems;
100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns, and 400 shotguns;
Over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds;
25,000 sets of body armor; and
25,000 helmets.
In addition to the weapons listed above, previous United States assistance committed to Ukraine includes:

Over 600 Stinger anti-aircraft systems;
Approximately 2,600 Javelin anti-armor systems;
Five Mi-17 helicopters;
Three patrol boats;
Four counter-artillery and counter-unmanned aerial system tracking radars;
Four counter-mortar radar systems;
200 grenade launchers and ammunition;
200 shotguns and 200 machine guns;
Nearly 40 million rounds of small arms ammunition and over 1 million grenade, mortar, and artillery rounds;
70 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) and other vehicles;
Secure communications, electronic warfare detection systems, body armor, helmets, and other tactical gear;
Military medical equipment to support treatment and combat evacuation;
Explosive ordnance disposal and demining equipment; and
Satellite imagery and analysis capability.
In addition to the U.S.-produced short-range air defense systems the Ukrainians have been using to great effect, the United States has also identified and is helping the Ukrainians acquire additional, longer-range systems on which Ukraine’s forces are already trained, as well as additional munitions for those systems.

There are people with the justified fear that direct NATO intervention in Ukraine, through things like a no fly zone (which would necessarily entail attacking Russian assets within Russia and Belarus) could easily lead to nuclear war.

That's not what Peskov is talking about even IF we were to take him at his word. He's specifically talking about using nukes in the context of the Ukraine and Russia conflict, not a Russia/NATO conflict. 

There is no contradiction in thinking that direct conflict between NATO and Russia, within Russia's borders, would lead to nuclear war and the idea that they won't nuke Ukraine without NATO conflict.

It's funny how you're dancing around that point and failing to mention that the actual nuclear conflict most people are talking about is entirely different than the one being proposed by Peskov. 

What it seems like you're doing here with this comment is incredibly dishonest and you should really clarify your position if I'm reading it wrong.

Yes there is justified fear of Russia using nukes in a direct conflict with NATO. That's the vast vast vast majority of the comments I have seen about Russia using nukes.",False,1648529426.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2iy4j3,,5,-2,0,-2,0,0,

Agreed - though a nationalistic war of conquest is not a realistic scenario being considered here (assuming the parent comment here was just being facetious). Kaliningrad is 95% ethnic Russian/Belarussian/Ukrainian - it's been generations since anyone in Poland or Germany cared about its possession as a point of national integrity.

What is conceivable is that Poland, as they proposed for Ukraine, would ask for NATO's blessing and logistical support to enforce a 'peacekeeping' mission in Kaliningrad to contain Russia's Baltic Sea fleet and neutralize any short-range nuclear-capable missile deployments, which from Kaliningrad could hit a target almost anywhere in Poland (Iskander-M have about a 500km range).

If Russia began to unilaterally and conspicuously deploy those weapons (arms control agreements having failed to deter them), and the Russian media talking heads bloviating about pushing onward from Ukraine to the Baltics, Moldova, and Warsaw heated up?  Poland would for sure raise it to NATO and the UN Security council, prepared to go it alone if need be. NATO would get roped into that conflict anyway, so I doubt they'd distance themselves from it.

&#x200B;

>In essence it would make NATO a gigantic threat to all neighbour countries.

Welcome to the Russian view of the world. To them, NATO *is* a gigantic threat. Their position is that NATO countries have sparked revolutions and supported anti-Russian puppet states on a slow-moving eastward march towards their heartland for the last 30 years. Repositioning armies, missile defenses, and nuclear-capable weapons closer and closer year by year. It's the entire reason for this conflict in Ukraine.

&#x200B;

>No other NATO operations come even close to such a scenario.

Should we talk about Yugoslavia? An offensive (that is, unprovoked by an attack) campaign of NATO airstrikes against territory in the Russian sphere of influence  is the reason there is an independent Kosovo looking to join the alliance. Which isn't to say that the conflict wasn't justified on humanitarian grounds. It was.

But from the 30,000 foot view, it sure does look like NATO, with some of its states more gung-ho and active than others, opted-in to bombing a Russian ally and accelerating its split into ethnic enclaves, and then over the course of the next 20 years absorbed most of its constituent parts into the alliance. Russia doesn't recognize an ""Independent"" Kosovo any more than NATO recognizes an independent Donetsk and Luhansk - to them it's annexation by another name (voluntary accession, democratic legitimacy, and national self-determination notwithstanding). 

It's conceivable that the same could happen in Kaliningrad. It would be colossally provocative, dangerous, and likely lead to a declaration of war by Russia. But it's conceivable.",False,1648576969.0,t3_tqolwd,t1_i2l0q6n,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
