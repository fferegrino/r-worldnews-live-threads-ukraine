Day 235 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there were some missile launches from Belgorod, but they didn‚Äôt make it to Kharkiv this time. They were fired at a weird time, at 11am, which is very early for missile strikes. At least 2 missiles were intercepted, and there were no explosions in Kharkiv or anywhere in oblast, so there were most likely just those 2 missiles and nothing else.

What was funny is that Russians in their telegram channels were angry that no missiles got through our defenses this time. They were asking ‚Äúthe missile launches happened, so why are there no posts about explosions in Kharkiv?!‚Äù Yeah, I wonder why. Well, they actually got some missiles back pretty soon after.

About 20 minutes later missiles started flying in the direction of Belgorod. Russians asked for explosions, so they got them. There were a couple of hits on their AA defenses in the Belgorod‚Äôs airport, and also some other places were hit, but I‚Äôm not sure which ones. Apparently we used HARMs to destroy their air defenses. They can‚Äôt even say that we were targeting civilians this time, because their military was filming the explosions as they were happening, with their camo tents visible in the background, and also some soldiers were walking by. They were even nice enough to show us the exact location of their base.",False,1665967698.0,t3_y572cv,t3_y572cv,,0,162,0,162,1,0,

A disturbing article about the tactics being used by press gangs in Russian cities to find men to fight in Ukraine.

Two details stand out: 

* These press gangs are active in Moscow and St. Petersburg, cities that were mostly spared draft activity until now. How desperate is the army if they're willing to create unrest in the capitol now?

* Medical professionals who signed contracts to provide medical care to troops are being assigned to fill holes in high-priority units regardless of specialty. For example, a doctor who was sent to join a tank crew.

 >Among grain crops, wheat, oats, barley and millet are traditionally cultivated in the region.  Grain production is focused on growing winter crops, which are characterized by higher yields.  Up to 80% of arable land is used for them.

 >Far beyond the borders of the Kherson region, Kherson watermelons and tomatoes are known as a sign of quality - this is a kind of visiting card of our region.

> This year, about 1.5 million tons of early grain crops were harvested in the Kherson region.  Harvesting of late grains and vegetables continues.

The thickness you need depends on the size and velocity of the incoming round.  Shrapnel from grenades and artillery become non-lethal if you are far enough from the explosion.  Leather would keep you from getting cut by sharp long range shrapnel.  Some US soldiers in Iraq came back with sand wounds because IEDs would blast concrete into their face.  It is hard for surgeons to pick out every grain of sand.  

Two steel plates offer very nearly the same armor protection as one that is twice as thick.  You could stack 5 or 10 and duck tape.  There is a point where armor is simply too heavy.  There is a spectrum from too heavy to be useful and so flimsy that it is useless.  There is no clear point where that line occurs.  

Good armor will have multiple layers.  Some outer parts help to shatter high velocity rounds. Some fabrics are designed to stretch and spread energy.  

Steel plates that are easy to remove could be a very cheap armor solution if troops are not moving much.  Really good armor cuts casualties by something like 25% (more with helmets and jackets).

Conscription has hit the Separatist enclaves so hard that the leading demographic in males in the last vote they had was around 70 years old....
2. Separatist militias have taken their plights to social media, and are becoming increasingly resistant to fighting for land outside of what they consider to be their own confederated States.  Especially after the UA is retaking land that their own men fought and died for in costly direct attacks ordered by the Russian military.
3. The Separatists have no formal training, their officer class has been decimated in the fighting, and their political leaders are hightailing it out of Ukraine to avoid prosecution WHEN the Separatist enclaves are finally liberated.

We also need to be fussing less about maintenance. In this kind of intense conflict, 3-5 year maintenance is not a worry. You don't need to know about deep engine maintenance cycles for the F-16 or how to perform the annual service on Abrams tracks, because the kit won't last that long.

I'm not saying that because it will be destroyed (of course, some will), but because combat use is *unbelievably* hard on wear and tear. Look at WW2 fighter aircraft, after a few months they were structurally, to use the technical term, completely knackered. At that point, you strip the instruments and avionics, the engine if you think it's salvageable (probably isn't to be honest), and send them back to the manufacturer, and basically scrap the rest. For trucks, 1 mile of combat driving can put on the wear of 50 miles of regular driving. If your truck is usually good for 500k miles, a pretty reasonable estimate for a commercial vehicle, that's now reduced to just 10k. That's... a few weeks of use, perhaps.

That's what I don't get, we're holding back all this stuff going ""oh but they need to be able to maintain it after the war"" - even if we give them F-16s now, the ones they have postwar likely won't be the original ones. They'll be wrecked from combat use. They're already hitting that problem now flying Soviet stuff that's designed to be more rugged than how we typically build it.

Neither Ukrainian nor Russian have a word for 'the'.  They don't.  There are no articles at all.  'Potato' and 'a potato' and 'the potato' are all just '–∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–ø–ª—è/–∫–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—à–∫–∞' (potato).  Russia may have spent a century looking down on Ukraine, but they didn't make English speakers adopt an article there.  English speakers did that.  If English-speaking Ukrainians perceive offense with the article, by all means let's not use it with Ukraine, but it makes no sense to start using it with countries we consider enemies, because they had nothing to do with *our* older usage of it, and it was *never* done to be disrespectful.  

It's just idiomatic translation.  There are also plenty such examples still in use in English which have not become pejorative.  'The Philippines' for example, does not make *any* native English speaker think of 'King Philip II's Islands', which is the reason the article is there, just as very few English speakers were ever aware what 'Ukraine' meant as a common noun in Russian or Ukrainian.  In linguistics we call this sort of thing 'frozen expressions', and it has no inherent sociological connotation where its meaning is no longer transparent.  The sociopolitics of the form are artificial rather than inherent.  See also reference to 'the Gambia' or 'the Sudan' as regions rather than countries.  Spanish has *many* more examples of this, and increases that to every geographic term in certain attributive contexts.  Different languages are different!

The effect of strikes (aircraft or missiles) is often significantly different from the apparent destruction.  Soldiers who are not in danger can operate freely.

Maybe they sand bag or trench their work spaces.  I don't know what they are doing, but any changes distract and undermine doing their job in a faster or more efficient manner.  

Averaging one truck per M31 is affordable in a war of attrition.  In practice the missile supply is limited for now.

 >A graphite bomb is intended to be a non-lethal weapon used to disable an electrical grid. The bomb works by spreading a dense cloud of extremely fine, chemically treated carbon filaments over air-insulated high voltage installations like transformers and power lines, causing short-circuits and subsequent disruption of the electricity supply in an area, a region or even an entire small country. The weapon is sometimes referred to as blackout bomb or as soft bomb because its direct effects are largely confined to the targeted electrical power facility, with minimal risk of immediate collateral damage.

As you say, nuclear weapons are the *only* reason Russia is still standing. Without them, there would be nothing deterring a *lot* of people for going after Russia after they showed the true state of their armed forces. In fact, the Russian nuclear arsenal is very possibly the *only* reason Putin chose to invade at all, knowing it would give him the cover that nobody would retaliate immediately.

However you look at it, this war has been a watershed moment for how a nuclear nation is able to behave as the aggressor. Perhaps in fifty years we will look back on this and wish we had been less soft on Russia in the build-up from the original annexation of Crimea, and less soft on how we handled events following Feb 24th.

I don't really see why the same could not happen here - Ukraine acquires weaponry from the West and purchases with it service agreements. Plenty of non-military vehicle fleets already operate like this. They provide the operators and routine / daily maintenance but anything major is the responsibility of the manufacturer or at least lessor. It's called dry hire. Aviation, maritime, and trucking all make big use of this model. I'm saying do the same, but for weaponry. Ukraine gets this stuff, gets the training to do the essential maintenance and repair (which would take at most the same time as training the crews to use it), and then does exactly what you've just described with the PzH 2000s, anything beyond their remit, there's a return and repair/replace programme for.

Mostly people who are against direct support for Ukraine (but not against Ukraine by any means) are saying that Israel should maintain *some* sort of minimal/""polite"" relationship with russia because of the situation in Syria (i.e russia allowing Israel to attack Iranian targets there every once in a while; if Israel takes a firm stance against russia, russia might let loose Iranian terrorism straight from the Syria/Israel border), and because of the situation of the Jewish community in russia (which already had some escalation from russia's side earlier in the war). So basically calling for local leaders to think of Israeli interests first, and stay out of affairs that Israel isn't forced into.  
(Although, note that Israel publicly does not acknowledge russia's recent sham annexation of Ukrainian territory.)

So it's not that people aren't supportive of Ukraine - they're just afraid of local, immediate consequence of going publicly against russia.   
For that reason alone, I think it's too divisive of a subject to use as election propaganda for current decision makers. 

As for the opposition - Netanyahu himself bragged in one of the previous election rounds (we've had several the last few years so I honestly can't remember which one) that he's BFFs with both Trump and putin, which is obviously a horrible look for him right now (apart from him being under lengthy criminal investigation), so I imagine he might try to avoid the subject altogether and focus on internal affairs - he's mainly focused on painting the current centrist/leftist coalition and ""dangerous""... he's been working hard for years in painting Israeli leftist politics as ""dangerous"" and ""traitorous"", and rightists as ""strong"" and ""righteous"". He's got a very strong, cult-like following (""Bibism""). It's a mess.

In short the internal political situation is incredibly murky and complicated as is. Politicians are so preoccupied with internal affairs that I'm frankly surprised our PM commented on the Iranian ballistic missiles report at all.

Russia wants the US to be weak because that would greatly serve its interests in its own sphere of influence (mostly genocide and kleptomania). Look how effortlessly the US supplied weapons and training to Ukraine even in the midst of significant political turmoil and a pandemic.

The military preeminence of the US depends on a relatively stable, meritocratic structure of the military itself as well as the bureaucracies surrounding it. It also depends on our commitment to internal peaceful transfer of power, which keeps our armed forces external and cohesive. Finally it depends on the ability to attract educated people to innovate for the military. Compared to many other countries, especially Russia, the levels of competence in these aspects is significantly better in the US. 

However, our Republican ""patriots"", led by Trump as they are, are hell bent on destroying the foundations of our competence. They reject democracy, meritocracy, innovation, and all the elements of stability.

An unstable undemocratic US, especially if the military is seriously divided, would make it as weak as Russia is now. And that's exactly what Russia wants. So far Putin's efforts to simply give money to insane people in the US have paid off handsomely.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsen\_Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsen_Pavlov)

>The assassination of Arsen Pavlov was part of a range of high-profile deaths within the ranks of Ukraine's separatists, starting with the assassination of Alexander Bednov, the leader of the Batman Battalion and Aleksey Mozgovoy, the leader of the Prizrak Brigade in May 2015. The death of Arsen Pavlov came within a month of the death of Yevgeny Zhilin, the founder of Oplot Battalion, which would later form into the Oplot Brigade.\[35\]\[36\]  
>  
>Ukrainian officials have stated that Arsen Pavlov was assassinated by Russia's special forces as part of a drive to purge early separatist leaders that took part in the original insurgency of 2014, who may be charismatic but are often unpredictable. Moreover, most of the separatist leaders assassinated headed their own units, which would often engage in infighting over territory or control of the black market, suspecting that the assassinations are part of a drive to form a more uniform chain of command. Another theory behind the assassination has been that there is a drive to get rid of the first generation of rebels who were implicated in war crimes, therefore giving the separatist forces a more acceptable public face. Indeed, Amnesty International has called for an investigation into Arsen Pavlov executing 15 unarmed Ukrainian prisoners. Moreover, Arsen Pavlov's alleged war crimes have been one of the sticking points of the implementations of the Minsk II agreement, with Ukrainian authorities stating that he would not be granted amnesty.\[37\]\[38\] Furthermore, Arsen Pavlov was not a Ukrainian citizen, being born and raised in Russia, and serving in the Russian military during the Chechen conflict. Thus, his involvement as the leader of a Ukrainian separatist movement was pointed to as an example of Russian interference in the conflict.\[39\]",False,1665928537.0,t3_y572cv,t1_isjgrkx,,5,3,0,3,0,0,
