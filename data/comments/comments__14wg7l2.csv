fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,14wg7l2,jrlevnf,"Day 498-503 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last few days continued to be mostly quiet. There were no missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv, but some Shaheds were spotted in our region multiple times since my previous post, though thankfully they were all intercepted. Missile strikes now happen much less frequently in general. I think the last one was about a week ago when they hit Pervomaiskyi, and even then, they only used 1 missile, which is basically nothing when comparing it to the previous year’s rate of 8-20 missiles per day every single day.

Even though a lot of people here expected more out of the NATO summit, I’d say it went about as good as realistically possible. I was just far too overhyped, in large part by us, so I can understand why many people ended up disappointed. Yeah, we didn’t get invited to NATO outright, but it wasn’t a realistic expectation to have in the first place. And then waiving MAP is also great, less bureaucratic hoops to jump through to join the alliance means less time for Russia to try and start another war after this one eventually ends. Honestly the announcement of new weapon packages is the most exciting part of this summit for me, and it looks like we will hear more about them tomorrow. 

What I still find weird is how there’s so much backlash about providing us cluster munitions, they will be used on our own territory and we will be the ones to clean them up afterwards, so I just don’t get why so many countries are concerned about it. They act as if we don’t use them, then there would be nothing else to clean up, but compared to the number of mines and other UXO that are already littering our country, the cluster munitions provided by the USA will barely be noticeable. Some people also seem to think that we are fighting this war to have a moral high ground, when for us it literally a war for survival, and we will use every tool to gain advantage. It’s like when Russians were crying about us being cowards and not having honor when we started bombing them from drones. Well, I would much rather be a coward than dead, but apparently Russians would choose death instead.",False,1689114058.0,t3_14wg7l2,t3_14wg7l2,,0,164,0,164,0,0,

>NATO’s prime task is to protect its current members — 31, and soon to be 32 once Sweden formally joins.

The three regional plans “explain what countries have to do given the geography of those regions to deter and defend, in all domains — space, cyber, land, maritime, air,” said Adm. Rob Bauer, chair of NATO’s Military Committee.

>They are designed to defend against both a military opponent, such as Russia, and against terrorism, a continuing preoccupation of many allies, including Turkey.
>
>“The plans are really the blueprint for the modernization of NATO’s collective defense system,” General Cavoli said in Vilnius on Tuesday, after years of the alliance focusing on conflicts away from Europe, such as in Afghanistan, while hoping for better relations with Russia.
>
>The plans, he said, “give us the ability to have a force structure requirement so that nations can direct their investments in a fashion that serves the alliance as well as their national needs.”
>
>The plans also aspire to have NATO forces on standby, so that as many as 300,000 troops drawn from member countries could deploy within 30 days if needed, with some available within three days and others within 10.

""NATO will make a strong and united decision on security guarantees for Ukraine during the alliance’s summit this week and reaffirm that Kyiv will eventually become a member, the grouping’s secretary general told NBC News on Tuesday.

Jens Stoltenberg also addressed the United States’ announcement that it would send cluster munitions to Ukraine, a decision that has made many of Washington’s allies uneasy.

“This war has now become actually for many months a war of attrition and a war of attrition is a backlog of logistics,” he said. “Slowly our production is now increasing, ramping up… but the problem is that since we didn’t have big enough stocks in the beginning and since production capacity was not big enough when this war started, it takes some time before we have all the production capacity in place.”

Asked whether the counteroffensive is getting bogged down, and whether he’s concerned it could become a frozen conflict, he said Ukrainians are gaining ground but they are meeting fierce resistance, with the Russians digging in.""",False,1689075849.0,t3_14wg7l2,t3_14wg7l2,,0,38,0,38,0,0,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=mx4wL-cipws

I really like military history channels take on the war. They see it as a multi year military conflict rather than being focused on the current month, like a lot of us do.

Here he explains why the Ukraine war has NOT turned into a war of attrition unlike what some are saying or advocating for and explain Ukraine's counteroffensive strategy with drawings and hand holding you like if you were 5.

Ukraine is doing almost the exact same thing the US did in Iraq. There the US, with the Saddam Line, did 100k sorties during a month and with them degraded Iraq's defenses and logistics to the point they were severily deteriorated, only then did they started the ground offensive.

Because Ukraine doesnt have the US airforce, it would take much longer to do so. Because Ukraine knows such a degradation would take them months or years and they cant wait that long, they have started the degradation campaign while at the same time also pushing and doing the ground campaign. This is why they are going slow, because Ukraine doesnt have the US airforce they are employing other, slower, methods to do the degradation campaign using artillery, drones, missiles, etc. to degrade Russian logistics and defenses while they push. Doing exactly the same thing that the US would do (minus combining the ground and degradation campaign) and using NATO doctrine.

The many kilometers advance people are expecting are meant to occur after the defensesive lines have been breached, not before. Expecting Ukraine to move fast into the defensive lines without degrading them is expecting them to do something not even the US or the allies at Normandy could do.

He says that going by the rate of Russian degradation he expects to see the massive breakthroughs and fast advances to happen during 2024. And that Russia is not doing whst the Ukranians are doing because they lack the capacity to hit the Ukranian rear, so they resort to nuclear threats and power plant strikes.",False,1689107227.0,t3_14wg7l2,t3_14wg7l2,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

> The June 4-7 battles in the southern direction showed the Armed Forces of Ukraine that, due to the terrain and the high density of settlements, it is impossible to use large groups of armored vehicles. They will be damaged or destroyed. 

> As such, there will no breakthroughs by tanks and infantry [in armored carriers] in the southern direction. Equipment will be destroyed or immobilized by manual means of destruction and then finished off by Russian artillery or helicopters from a distance. 

> Therefore, UA quickly adjusted and use a different tactic in the southern direction. An artillery battery or HIMARS, or heavy mortars are assigned to a squad or platoon of infantry (depending on the task). Then, proceeding very *slowly* and carefully, so as not to get spotted by RF, the infantry advances to the RF stronghold that they must take. Specifically, the UA infantry proceed *on foot*. If everything goes smoothly, the group reaches their target undetected, then the UA group commander assesses the strength of the enemy there. If there is an RF tank or an infantry fighting vehicle hidden at the stronghold, and/or if they can uncover where the RF mortars and guns are located, those [guns, tanks] are hit by artillery, and then, a [close combat] attack follows.

> Sometimes the artillery attack causes the Russians to retreat on their own, abandoning the damaged or even intact vehicles. 

> Sometimes the artillery attack is not successful, and the attack ensues using grenades, flamethrower systems and small arms.

> The Ukrainians then inspect the captured stronghold, deploy defenses, wait for the [new Ukrainian] unit that will occupy it and move on.

> If the strongpoint is part of a defense network of *several* RF defensive positions, then Ukraine has to take them one by one, clear them [of Russians], clear them of mines, wait for [new Ukrainian unit] who will sit at these positions, and only then, move forward.

> Considering that the distances between strongholds can be up to 10 km apart, these advances *by foot* by Ukrainian infantry over rough terrain—with constant pauses of lying on the ground and ducking in bushes and waiting behind trees while a Russian drone flies by— takes 5-8 hours.^1


> Losses in such battles are constant [on UA side]. For a civilian observer, they may seem small: 1-3 killed per day in battles, 8-11 wounded.  However, such losses actually amount to *a third* of the personnel of the platoon, and so after such losses, they can only return to their original positions, or to the nearest stronghold captured. 

> If the group is particularly unlucky, like if it has an insufficiently-trained commander or the Russians in that sector have an intelligent UAV-operator and well-placed observers, then the UA group will be destroyed or dispersed even before approach towards the stronghold to launch an attack. Actually, it’s exactly this type of footage—from the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive—that z-channels regularly publish, passing it off as a mass exodus of UA attackers. In fact, this is a rare occurrence from one of the unfortunate or unlucky groups.

> Unlike the RF Armed Forces where many strongholds [bunker-like trenches] not even close to at the front line may not be supplied with water, ammunition, food or medics for several days,^2 the Armed Forces of Ukraine are trying to ensure the steady supply of units and the evacuation of the wounded. This is also not conducive to rapid progress [of the counteroffensive].

The counteroffensive is proceeding slowly. Many HIMARS and Storm Shadow strikes in the previous few weeks which have wrecked Russian rear areas as well as frontline artillery positions. The fighting is still very slow and tough due to the extensive belts of mines the Russians have laid and a general lack of vehicles and air superiority.

Biden has decided to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions (for artillery). This has been met with a lot of criticism, an emotional reaction to the sometimes banned weapon. But it seems much more harmful to civilians to deprive Ukraine of the necessary armaments to win the war than it does to potentially leave more explosives strewn around Russian positions and trench lines, when there are already thousands of mines there and probably unexploded ordnance too.

Prigozhin has met with Putin. It seems like Putin wants to wrest control of Wagner slowly. This makes sense because the group has a pretty substantial combat power which he will need if he wants to win the war, which he does. So there is a careful balance to be had here by Putin, ie. no great purge. What exactly will be the fate of Prigozhin and Wagner in general is still really unclear. I think I feel more confident though in now saying that Lukashenko may have some bold ambitions. It is clear for the Wagnerites in Belarus that he wants to bring them as close to his regime as possible, something which Putin is currently in no position to stop. The feudalisation of the Russian military-imperial apparatus will continue in this fashion as time goes on, and there are probably more groups which have yet to form to contribute to the general chaos. Girkin, for his part, was complaining (of course) about being banned from speaking in a bookstore in St. Petersburg. I hope it wasn't the one I went to. ISW claims he has a feud ongoing with the FSB.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-11-23/index.html

""The White House sought to make clear that US President Joe Biden’s controversial decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine was a “temporary” measure, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan telling reporters that it will be a matter of “months” as Ukraine bridges a munitions gap.

“The unitary rounds that we've been providing and that we've been getting other allies and partners to provide to Ukraine, those stockpiles are running low,” Sullivan said.

He continued, “We were not prepared to leave Ukraine defenseless, period. So for us, when it came down to the choice, our choice was, despite the difficulty, despite the challenges, despite the risks of civilian harm associated with cluster munitions, the risk to civilian harm of leaving Ukraine without the ammo it needed was, from our perspective, greater,"" Sullivan said.

Biden told CNN's Fareed Zaharia Friday that he took the ""difficult decision"" to provide Ukraine with cluster munitions because ""the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition"" needed to sustain its counteroffensive against Russia.

Sullivan added that the US views the provision of cluster munitions as “temporary” until more unitary rounds can be produced.

“We view that as temporary because many months ago, we began the intensive process of ramping up our unitary round production. Once it hits a level where unitary round production can satisfy Ukraine's needs, then there will be no need to continue giving cluster munitions,” he said, declining to provide a timeline due to questions of usage rates and the defense industrial base hitting its production marks.

Pressed again on timing, he said, “It's months, but the question is, how many?”

Why are cluster munitions controversial?: Cluster munitions are canisters that carry tens to hundreds of smaller bomblets. The canisters break open at a prescribed height, depending upon the area of the intended target, and the bomblets inside are dispersed over that area.

Because bomblets fall over a wide area, they can endanger non-combatants.

Over 100 countries, including the UK, France and Germany, have outlawed the munitions under the Convention on Cluster Munitions, but the US and Ukraine are not signatories to the ban.""",False,1689077001.0,t3_14wg7l2,t3_14wg7l2,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

[honestly, it reads like *How to be an Army: 101*]

> The each of fortifications are equipped by the unit occupying it and responsible for defending that position. The *quality* of the fortification directly depends on the commander of that specific fortification—whether his men have necessary tools and experience. General Mikhail Teplinsky—who was charged with organizing the defense in the south—did a lot of work with teaching the officers, constantly explaining to them that the lives of their soldiers directly depend on the quality of, strength of, and depth of the trench-fortifications. Those who comprehended, expertly dug, like a band of moles. Those officers who didn’t comprehend [linking their lives with strength of fortifications], either die during the artillery attacks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; or during mortar attacks; or during the [close combat] assaults at their poorly-equipped positions; or they retreat at the first threat (real or imaginary threat). By the way, according to Russian officers, Chechen units are among those who disdain “earthworks” [digging the bunker-like trenches], which has already led to the loss of several of their strongholds, and elsewhere, the withdrawal of neighboring units.

> The second task that Teplinsky was partially able to solve was to explain to the unit commanders the importance of interacting with the ""neighbors,"" ie, neighboring units occupying neighboring strongholds. Again, not everyone listened to/obeyed Teplinsky, but those who did, now demonstrate an efficiency thus-far unprecedented in this war by RF Armed Forces. Commanders establish contact with neighboring units, agree on firing sectors, agree on mutual cover, and notify of movements so as not to fall under friendly fire.

_____

In describing the fortified Russian trenches, they say:

> . . . deep enough to hold a full posture (ie, the depths greater than men’s height) [so at least 6ft, likely 8ft], reinforced with boards, logs, bags of earth or sand and then with even-deeper bunker-like dugouts, where the RF infantry can hide from shelling and survive. There are several cloistered, and dug in such a way that if the defensive line is broken—depending on the terrain—they can cover from the trench [network] from three or four sides. At some of the bunker-trenches, there are long-term firing points made of concrete; but for the most part, the building material is wood and soil.

> These fortifications are located either in a forest belt, or in a village, or on a hill.

> They have several heavy machine guns, anti-tank weapons, *Shmel* flamethrowers, grenades, and small arms.

""Ukraine still has requirements to meet before it can possibly join NATO, according to White House National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby.

He pushed back against comments from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky Tuesday criticizing NATO leaders over discussions on a path to NATO membership.

“We believe that NATO is in Ukraine's future. I mean, that's something that the alliance agreed way back in 2008,” Kirby told CNN. “Now there’s some reforms — good governance, rule of law, political reforms — that Ukraine needs to work on, and we understand it's hard to work on some of those reforms when you are at war. Of course, they are at war right now. So, NATO membership in the immediate future isn't likely because that would put NATO at war with Russia.”

Still, Kirby acknowledged frustration from Zelensky, who tweeted a scathing criticism of discussions over a potential path to NATO membership at this week’s summit in Lithuania on Tuesday, writing “Uncertainty is weakness.”

“Yes, there are frustrations, there are desires to end this war quickly, all of that we understand, Kirby said. “Of course, we share many of those concerns.”""",False,1689085434.0,t3_14wg7l2,t3_14wg7l2,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

But Ukraine also deserves respect. Now, on the way to Vilnius, we received signals that certain wording is being discussed without Ukraine.

And I would like to emphasize that this wording is about the invitation to become NATO member, not about Ukraine's membership.

It’s unprecedented and absurd when time frame is not set neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine's membership. While at the same time vague wording about ""conditions"" is added even for inviting Ukraine.

It seems there is no readiness neither to invite Ukraine to NATO nor to make it a member of the Alliance.

This means that a window of opportunity is being left to bargain Ukraine's membership in NATO in negotiations with Russia. And for Russia, this means motivation to continue its terror.

Uncertainty is weakness. And I will openly discuss this at the summit.""

>
>THE EDITORIAL BOARD
>
>With a large-scale war still ravaging the heart of Europe, leaders of Nato’s 31 member states meeting in Vilnius for their annual summit have one overriding task: to maintain and project unity. Kyiv has been seeking reassurances that Nato members remain committed to supplying it with the means to repel Russia’s aggression — and for guarantees that its future lies within the north Atlantic alliance. In Moscow, meanwhile, proceedings are surely being scrutinised by Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin for any hint of division or softening. The message as the summit goes into its second day is distinctly mixed.
>
>Breaking the impasse over admitting Sweden as a member is a clear positive. Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan extracted concessions for lifting his year-long opposition, including US approval of a $20bn deal for Ankara to buy F-16 fighters. But Swedish accession — coming after Finland joined in April — will bolster Nato’s military capacity, and its ability to defend the entire Baltic region against a revanchist Russia. It is also proof to the Kremlin of how counter-productive its war, supposedly aimed at deterring Nato expansion, has turned out to be.
>
>On Ukraine, however, wording agreed on Tuesday fell well short of giving Kyiv the clear path and timeline to membership that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sought. The alliance did remove the need for Ukraine to pass through a bureaucratic accession process, and made membership dependent on a future political agreement. But by stating only that Nato would extend an invitation to Kyiv to join “once allies agree and conditions are met”, it exposed tensions between a cautious US and Germany, and many central and east European members — plus the UK and France — that have pressed for an expedited process.
>
>President Joe Biden is right to note that bringing Ukraine into the alliance while it is at war with Russia is unrealistic, as it would draw Nato itself into the conflict. Yet it would have been preferable to extend an invitation now that would have put Kyiv on a path to joining soon after the current conflict has ended. Zelensky called Tuesday’s verbal fudge a motivation for Russia “to continue its terror”.
>
>This makes it paramount that allies provide Ukraine with robust and credible security assurances for as long as it is not a Nato member. That means continuing to provide sufficient military and financial support after the conflict ends to deter new Russian aggression and enable Ukraine to rebuild its economy. US officials have cited the “Israel model”, referring to the overt military support Washington provides to the Jewish state without a guarantee that it would use military force to defend it.
>
>…
>
>US caution over Kyiv’s Nato membership hints, too, at the limits of America’s readiness to continue to underwrite Europe’s security, nearly 75 years after the alliance’s foundation. Russia’s aggression underlines the need for Europe’s democracies to sharply raise levels of defence spending that are still far short of those in the US — and to take far greater responsibility for defending their own continent, including Ukraine.

>
>It’s a fast track with a slow start. NATO leaders meeting in Vilnius today released their summit communiqué, in which they said that Ukraine no longer needs to complete a membership action plan to join the Alliance—but that an invitation would only be extended “when allies agree and conditions are met.” In the meantime, the allies pledged to work closely with Kyiv through a newly established NATO-Ukraine Council. With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s biggest request—a timeline for membership—unfulfilled, have allies truly bolstered Ukraine’s security as it battles against Russia’s full-scale invasion? What else did the Alliance agree to regarding Russia and Ukraine? Our experts, who are all at the center of the action in Vilnius, decode the communiqué.
>
>Roadmap or roadblock?
>
>John tells us that the communiqué’s conditional language and lack of timeline amounts to “not much movement beyond the 2008 Bucharest NATO Summit language noting that Ukraine would eventually be a member.”
>
>That’s remarkable given that the 2008 language, which also encompassed prospective Georgian membership, “has been derided for years for placing both Georgia and Ukraine in the worst strategic position possible,” Rachel observes, with multiple Russian invasions of both countries occurring in the intervening years. “The problem with vague language like this is that it kicks the can down the road.”
>
>“Inside the geeky NATO universe, the upgrading of the NATO-Ukraine Commission to Council status and the removal of formal membership action plan requirements for Ukraine are significant developments,” Chris adds. “But neither packs a political punch or will be viewed as real progress on the membership question.”
>
>There was also no mention in the communiqué of security guarantees for Ukraine “that were broadly promised in the run-up to the summit,” Chris notes. “The combination of these things makes for an underwhelming package for Ukraine, though some small hope remains for better outcomes at tomorrow’s inaugural NATO-Ukraine Council meeting.”

ba7112447ab9666116afcc4a13e60576,14wg7l2,jrl6n3q,"I think the problem is that Ukraine doesn't actually want NATO membership, they want a security guarantee that they won't be left to fend for themselves once the war is over. No half assed Budapest paper for Putin to wipe his butt with, certainly no ""peace"" treaty that involves giving in to Russian demands. NATO membership provides all that, and Ukraine doesn't trust that they won't get it otherwise.

And that is exactly the problem.

All the major military nations in NATO have been allied since the treaty was made in 1951. Except Turkey joined in 1952, and Germany in 1955 (the day after the Occupation ended). Between then and this year, almost every country that's joined is small, and didn't alter the alliance significantly. Like letting in Macedonia or even Spain (40 years ago) was not a major change. Even Sweden and Finland joining is no big deal, as they've been partnered with NATO since before the fall of the Soviet Union. At this point it was almost a formality, they were already close allies. Ukraine just doesn't have that kind of relationship.

On the flip side though, it is incredibly important to the US in particular that Russia lose this war as badly as possible. And that Ukraine does as well as possible after the war ends. Because it drives home to China, and even countries like India and Brazil, that supporting authoritarian violence is a losing proposition. The motivation to help rebuild Ukraine is enormous, for ideological reasons on top of the economic ones. America absolutely loves being the ""good guys"", and abandoning Ukraine would be the total opposite of that. So I wouldn't be remotely surprised to see the US, maybe jointly with Poland, offer concrete guarantees of security as a prelude to full NATO membership. Honestly they don't want to be seen as turning Ukraine into some sort of vassal though, and you know they get accused of that all the time.

In the meantime, Abrams are already on their way, and we're working on the F-16s. I believe Ukraine is the first country in the world to receive these retrofits, the US hadn't previously shrunk their Abrams stockpiles for anyone.

Not really, but perhaps hopeful for some creative alternative.

Everyone should be thinking about the scenarios through which this conflict ends, because as with any war, the way this one closes could set the stage for the next.  If this war closes with Ukraine as a buffer zone between NATO and Russia, it will be very unstable with high potential for a sense of betrayal. An easy scenario to imagine is Russia booted to 1991 borders, but continuing the slow game, sending missiles/drones every other week simply to keep the perpetual message that Ukrainians can fight for NATO but are not actually in. Hid

 Entry is absolutely possible during the ongoing conflict. The issue isn't NATO policies that redditors harp on about (which have been 100% flexible throughout NATOs history).

See, they can’t be unified before primaries, they have to distinguish themselves so as to say they’re a better option than the other Republican contenders.

But after Republican nominees are selected, the RNC will issue talking points of their platform.  And it will be all sorts of criticisms, many of which are antithetical towards other criticisms.  For example, there will be a criticism that ammunition production was not increased, whereas elsewhere in their platform they will criticize DOD contract and the “government overreach” into “private industry” include the defense industry.  

But the RNC is holding off, in part because that’s what they do until after convention, in part because the positions of the candidates are so diverse and try to align winning candidates to overall agenda.

Having said that, I'm leaning towards no. If we talk about regions, the only places that are really ripe for this is with Chechnya and maybe Dagestan. It's possible that other regions might develop their own warlords given enough time, but that would probably require an extended period of complete instability and lack of power from Moscow (like years). So that largely depends on Moscow's ability to project authority across the country without Putin, and I don't think it will be much of a problem for them. 

If we talk about factions, we should keep in mind that the FSB *is* the government, and even if Putin dies, the FSB's top guys are still in the top positions of power and influence. I can imagine in the event of Putin's death, whether natural or intentional, the top siloviki have contingencies in place, in which they scramble to lock down power. My guess is that they'll let the characterless Mishustin step up as acting President according to the order of succession, while the siloviki work behind the scenes to ensure the media, national guard, and military stays under their control, and start prepping the nation for their new chosen leader. I doubt the national guard will be hard for them to secure - the low level brutes are brainless zombies who are loyal to Putin first and foremost, but if he's dead, then they'll be loyal to the glorious greatness of mother Russia, and they'll do what their told. The FSB only has to promise the new leaders of the National Guard the they'll continue living a life of luxury, and the deal is done. 

Probably the military will be harder for the FSB to control, since it is already battered and losing morale, and Shoigu is already seen as a bullshit bureaucrat by Russian soldiers who doesn't know the difference between lock, stock, and barrel. It might not be enough to simply stick a new guy in charge. Still, I'm not sure that the Russian military is capable of mutiny on a grand scale, at least grand enough to threaten the FSB. 

Some might be tempted to suggest that Gazprom or Rosneft with their new PMCs could become warlords, and it's not impossible, but keeping in mind that these companies are really nothing without the corporate infrastructure that exists in Moscow.

The communique dials them right back to 2008 status, and 2008 status was ""we are going to pretend you might be able to join, but it is never going to happen.""

I'm not sure how fast you expect to be able to scale production, but there are limits to how fast you can realistically train people to do complex tasks, expand production while maintaining acceptable quality, acquire machine tools/build out new tooling, etc. I don't see how they could necessarily do much more than that.

They do not appear to be short on people capable of digging trenches or doing other unskilled labor.

Beyond this....they're a poor country even before the war and Western aid while huge is still not sufficient to even fully offset the costs of the war. Places like the US + UK were some of the richest places in the world at the time and could thus put a somewhat larger share of towards the war while still maintaining the basics than you can expect a poorer country to be able to without having things fall apart at home.

Perpetua: russia has put a lot of forces in this area (Kreminna up past Svatove).  Their stated goal is to recapture Lyman.  This is similar to their previous stated goal of capturing Bakhmut.  The northern area up near Novasolevska is part of that area that could launch at any moment - I guess you could say it already launched.  They've taken ground W of Kreminna, moving W/SW from Debrova and moving W into Torske.  This is going to be a major offensive, probably.

Exit: is there any reason this area is tactically or strategically important?

Perpetua: They want Ukraine to withdraw from Siversk, back to Ukraine's main defensive line.  That's kind of their long term goal.  It seems kind of impossible from my perspective for this to happen.  I very much could see them moving up to the Zherebets  river.  I could see them taking Torske, Yampil, even Lyman.  But I don't think they get much further than that. Torkse is in a bad spot because the Zherebets river is a legitimate obstacle.  Ukraine crossing this river and controlling Torske was prety important to keep going towards Kreminna.  But if they lose the town again, which is at least a coin flip, will make it harder.  Holding this land is important because taking it back will not be easy.

Perpetua: The way russia withdrew from Lyman was a disaster and let Ukraine take this area.  If russia takes it back it will be difficult to retake it again.

Constantine: I think this will be an even bigger bloodbath for russia than Bakhmut.

Perpetua: This wouldn't be good for Ukraine, but it's not  a huge success for russia.  If they take a ton of casualties, especially a lot of tanks, it could be crippling and their last offensive.  An all-out attack like in Bakhmut could backfire.

Constantine: I don't believe russia can do it.

While WW1 is famous for its supposed static trenches in which soldiers would senselessly throw away their lives in human wave attacks and like any good myth, there is some truth to it because this was true for part of the war.

However, near the end of the war this was changing and for both sides.

New techniques and approaches where developed, like stormtroopers and tanks to break through trench lines near the end of the war, both of which turned to be highly successful.

Take for example the 1918 Spring offensive, where Germany tried to ""one-shot"" the allies before America could enter the war proper:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_spring_offensive

While strategically a failure, operationally Germany made huge territorial gains, deploying the new stormtrooper units.

Allies then and later successfully deployed some very successful early tanks against German lines.

In front line, the civilians are removed.  And in “immediate rear.”

It used to just be the Russians who did this.  Now Ukraine does, too.

The Russians used to do this because wanted full access to all available resources (food, shelter).  But they’d let folks slip thru cracks.  Specifically, farmers and civil engineers (like that worked for utilities).  Or collaborators (ie, local police). But they got suspicious that even those people were giving away RF positions so now it’s *none*—and the animals end up being the biggest issue.

If this spreads further south, yes issue.

But realize, civilians have curfews, but a random farmer doesn’t have to sit in a trench with no water delivery.

There's also the escalation thing.  Russia *will not* believe a foreign fighting force will magically stop at the border.  Boots on the ground will mean boots marching towards Moscow, that's what they'll think.  It could well drive them to desperate and stupid measures, so there is that to consider also.

Air power alone (i.e. no boots) might work, but you have to eliminate air defenses, and many of those lie within Russia, which means striking within Russia and that's a lot less palatable.  Otherwise, your air power is constantly under threat.

So, despite what *i'd like to see* unfortunately there's too many unpalatable aspects to it... right now.  Maybe if Russia was truly dumb fucks and blew up a nuclear power plant.  Maybe they got that message on the quiet.  I suspect maybe they did, but only time will tell.

> NATO standardization is the development and implementation of concepts, doctrines and procedures to achieve and maintain the required levels of compatibility, interchangeability or commonality needed to achieve interoperability.

> Standardization affects the operational, procedural, materiel and administrative fields. Examples include a common doctrine for planning a campaign, standard procedures for transferring supplies between ships at sea and interoperable materiel such as fuel connections at airfields. It permits NATO member countries to work together, as well as with NATO partner countries, preventing duplication and promoting better use of economic resources.

The big news though is that NATO is willing to do a one-step process similar to what Sweden and Finland got, instead of the traditional two-step process they were initially offering. In addition, keeping Ukraine out of NATO no longer a bargaining chip in anyone’s eyes. This is a big step of shifting the terms that Russia can hope to get out of a peace deal. 

The point of the longer process is to make countries that plan to join declare how they are going to reshape their military to match NATO standards, since a lot of the countries that joined in the 1990s had to completely change their militaries to match NATO standards. Most are still in the process in some ways, which is why Ukraine was able to get so many old soviet planes revamped with NATO software from its allies.

If NATO had just yeeted all its inventory over on day 1, Russia might have decided it would lose and just take its toys and go home.  Although that would have been best for Ukrainian citizens, it would not be best for the strategy of destroying as much of Russia's extensive inventory as possible.

Russia could at any point just declare ""mission accomplished"" and go home.  At least the could have early on in the war.  Now they're all in it seems, but there was a point where they could have just declared the SMO ""complete"" and pulled out.

This way they've ensured Russia is bled white before the conflict ends.

A little bit conspiratorial, but I think this makes slightly more sense than the ""fear of escalation"" explanation that has been used up until now.  Leaders will only speak in half-truths publicly, because it's war.  You can't take it at face value.

There just isn't really a strong appetite to spend that amount, reduce reserves, and risk escalation among most of the West.

Article 5 wasn't triggered, and there wasn't authorization for military action from the UN Security Council.

In other words, if NATO rolled into Ukraine right now and started bombing the shit out of Russians, it would be no different than what they did in Serbia.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia

""Yugoslavia's refusal to sign the Rambouillet Accords was initially offered as justification for NATO's use of force. NATO countries attempted to gain authorisation from the UN Security Council for military action, but were opposed by China and Russia, who indicated that they would veto such a measure. As a result, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a humanitarian intervention. The UN Charter prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack – neither of which were present in this case.

The bombing was NATO's second major combat operation, following the 1995 bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was the first time that NATO had used military force without the expressed endorsement of the UN Security Council and thus, international legal approval, which triggered debates over the legitimacy of the intervention.""",False,1689111150.0,t3_14wg7l2,t1_jrl0h5w,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The issue with the range is, that these missiles are airborn, you need ab aircraft to launch it and you need to launch it quite a distance from the frontline to avoid losing the aircraft itself. This reduces the effective range a lot.

Much better are the ground launched cruise missles, because the enemy is not able to detect the launcher like a plane and therefor you can get the launcher much closer to the frontline , increasing its effective range.

Edit:  modern RU anti-aircraft defense system can easily detect and counter targets within a range of 290km (detection up to 600km, missile range up to 400km (?)).

There exists Republicans who can give credit where credit is due.  Including to Biden.  Some do this because they strive to have personal integrity and they’re being honest (for example Rep Michael McCaul, Sen Romney), but others because they believe it’s personally advantageous to align with Biden on a handful of issues due to who their constituents are (Gov Sununu, Rep Mace).  *Many* have retired in the last 5 years [sigh], bc the US was so influenced by Fox propaganda that there could no longer be diversity of thought while still maintaining general respect.

Ten years ago, when Graham was palling around with McCain, and he was still in the Air Force as a lawyer, he was a fair-minded, reasonable person.

Russia has plenty of men, but are russian soldiers happy to die? For now yes lol, but more corpses can add a little extra pressure to them. Ukrainians have nowhere to run, that is their land and many soldiers have family in the occupied territories, but russians have the option to return home whenever they want. 

Basically, all Ukraine needs is time. Time to kill more russians, to demote their military. But the problem is that, in the process, Ukraine is vulnerable: to an internal political crisis (many men are also dying and people might feel that there is no hope for the EU/NATO and become demoralized), to an external political crisis, especially in USA

Now if we explore what Ukraine actually wanted... Ukraine desired to receive a strong commitment and path to membership upon the conclusion of the war. In order for the alliance to make such a strong commitment and theoretical timeline, they would, by virtue, have to also agree to DEFINE what the end of the war actually looked like to the alliance. Otherwise it would be absolutely untenable to attempt to try and form any level of consensus amongst alliance members. Because it is still up in the air as to whether Russia may retain Ukrainian territory, retain Crimea or make it independent, stall the conflict, etc. Now the issue here is A. They would be giving up bargaining power in the future negotiations by so plainly stating their long term desires, and B. They would very much be giving Russia a clear framework to prevent Ukraine from joining the alliance long term and in turn significantly amplify Russia's own bargaining power whenever the conflict comes to a resolution. Among other issues.

&#x200B;

Strategic ambiguity has always been at the forefront of US policy. It helps them retain leverage. Once you commit yourself to something that is it, you lose leverage, and in a conflict who's precise ending is still entirely up in the air and almost wholly dependent on Ukraine as opposed to US decision making, they shouldn't and won't make that commitment at this point. That leverage is not something that should be freely given away now, it's something that could be pivotal to driving a better outcome from Russia. Further, it's impossible to make a long term commitment when the details aren't even close to settled. There is nothing wrong with being optimistic about the outcome, but to make such far reaching policy solely assuming the best case scenario would be absolutely nonsensical.

&#x200B;

There are more complexities around the issue than just that, but that is the clearest way I can convey why it was ridiculous that anyone ever thought the alliance would settle on anything involving a firm timeline to membership at this point. People were and are still letting their emotions run ahead of them. World leaders have far too much responsibility resting on their shoulders to let their decision making run away on emotional pleas like that.",1689140860.0,1689140417.0,t3_14wg7l2,t1_jrkxoha,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
