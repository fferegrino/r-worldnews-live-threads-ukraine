https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-27-23/index.html

""Ukrainian forces in southern Ukraine can be seen for the first time at one of Russia's long-stretching ""dragon's teeth"" defensive lines in a new video circulating on Russian social media. 

CNN has geolocated the video to an area just east of the small villages of Nove and Kharkove in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia oblast. 

The video was taken from a Russian military position and shows a Ukrainian military vehicle moving in a field, heading toward a ditch in front of a large row of ""dragon's teeth"" — concrete and rebar pyramids that can serve as barriers against tanks. The apparent driver of the vehicle appears and begins running back toward a tree line.

For months, satellite images have shown that the Russians have installed the ""dragon's teeth"" lines across the territory they control in Ukraine. The ""teeth"" are laid out in three-deep rows that stretch for hundreds of miles; on either side of the concrete lines, Russian forces have also dug massive anti-tank trenches.

When the vehicle hits the trench, a big puff of dirt and smoke is seen. A second later, the front end of the vehicle appears to be stuck, with its front end sitting on top of the trench. 

It's unclear what exactly is happening in the video. Pro-Ukrainian channels claim it's their forces testing the ability for a vehicle to make it over the trench and the ""dragon teeth,"" while pro-Russian channels claim it's a casualty of one of their military strikes. 

What is clear, however, is the Ukrainian counteroffensive in southern part of the country has made notable gains in the last several days.

While the ability of the Ukrainians to push Russian forces back behind their ""dragon teeth"" line is a clear indicator, the counteroffensive has been successful so far. 

The defensive line also poses a significant obstacle that the counteroffensive will need to find ways to overcome in the days, weeks, and months to come.""",False,1690497316.0,t3_15arain,t3_15arain,,0,75,0,75,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-27-23/index.html

""Heavy rocket strikes slammed the critical logistics hub of Tokmak in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine on Thursday, according to a regional leader installed by Moscow.

Ukraine's military carried out the ""massive"" attack using multiple rocket launchers, according to Vladimir Rogov, a senior Russian-appointed official in the Zaporizhzhia region. 

Three rockets exploded and a fourth fell near a railway station but did not explode, Rogov said on Telegram. One person was wounded, he added.

What's happening in the region: Tokmak is a Russian logistics headquarters located south of Zaporizhzhia city, with a rail line to the Russian-annexed peninsula of Crimea. It is about 20 to 25 kilometers (15 miles) from Ukrainian frontline positions.

It has come under regular fire from Ukrainian rocket and missile systems, including multiple rocket launchers, but is currently beyond the range of most artillery systems.

Ukraine appears to be ramping up its counteroffensive in the area, deploying extra troops to the southern front, according to Russian and US officials. Rogov admitted this week that Kyiv's forces have been able “to wedge in” three sections of Russia’s first line of defense in the Zaporizhzhia region.""",False,1690477892.0,t3_15arain,t3_15arain,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

>
>The five men spoke to each other softly, in English, as the sun crept up over the water. The marshy banks were deserted except for swarms of persistent, biting mosquitoes. The soldiers moved inland towards a handful of abandoned holiday homes, taking up positions on the top floor of a sprawling mansion, which was once used to entertain local oligarchs, and locking the door behind them. It would be home to one half of the reconnaissance team Vidmak, or Witcher, for the next five days until they were relieved by another squad. Or so they thought.
>
>The ten-strong team, comprising veterans of British, American and Australian forces and idealists who fought Isis in Syria, are now regulars in the Ukrainian armed forces. During more than eight weeks of intense fighting, they have helped Ukraine to drive the Russians from the Dnipro delta islands and set up a bridgehead on the occupied side of the river, opening up a new avenue of attack for the summer counteroffensive. Speaking to The Times, they revealed details of the operation, now in its final “mopping up” phase, for the first time.
>
>Suicide drones and US-supplied fast boats with heavy weapons have given Ukrainian special forces an edge here, particularly after floods caused by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam swept away enemy positions, killing Russian troops who were not informed about the plan to blow it up.
>
>“Over the past few months the army has taken a lot of the islands and we’ve secured a really solid foundation across the Dnipro,” said Harry Rowe, 36, a British veteran of fighting Isis in Syria under the pseudonym Macer Gifford. “We’ve killed a lot more of them than they have of us and taken out their artillery.”
>
>British intelligence last week noted an “increase in fighting around the lower reaches of the Dnipro River” as well as “intense combat” on contested islands and the small Ukrainian bridgehead near the ruined Antonivskyi Bridge.
>
>The Witcher team were more bullish. “At this moment it looks like the Russians have given up on the islands we’re operating on and are locked down on the Oleshky side,” said Damien Rodriguez, 42, the team’s American commander. “I think next we’ll go for one of the towns around this area to get a full foothold.

""Ukraine's military is waging attritional battles south of Bakhmut with the ultimate aim of cutting Russian supply routes into the devastated eastern city, which Moscow's forces captured in the spring, according to officials.

Ukraine is ""gradually advancing"" south of Bakhmut and fighting persists in Klishchiivka, Kurdiumivka and Andriivka — three villages south of the city, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said.

""The fighting is quite fierce,"" Maliar said. ""The enemy is firing intensively.”

The Ukraine military also said Ukrainian units repelled a Russian counter-attack south of Bakhmut.

Serhii Cherevatyi, the spokesperson for the Eastern Grouping of the Ukrainian military, said there had been 11 combat engagements in the area over the past day.

Along the border of the Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, the Russians were continuing efforts to push Ukrainian units back, Maliar said.

“In the Kupyansk sector, the enemy is attacking, trying to drive us from our dominant heights,"" she said. ""Today, our defenders repelled several attacks without losing positions,” she said.

However, Cherevatyi noted that the number of enemy assaults around Lyman was lower than average. Compared to a recent peak of 10 to 15, he said there were three enemy attacks in areas within the Serebryansky forest and Bilohorivka.""",False,1690497146.0,t3_15arain,t3_15arain,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-27-23/index.html

""Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed that Ukrainian forces have suffered heavy losses during an intensified effort to break through Russian defenses in southern Ukraine.

Putin was speaking on the margins of the Russia-Africa summit in St Petersburg.

He said that in the last few days “we confirm that hostilities have intensified and in a significant way,” and that the main clashes took place in the Zaporizhzhia region.

His comments come as US officials tell CNN that Ukraine appears to be ramping up its counteroffensive and has committed additional resources in this area in recent days.

Putin said that “without any exaggeration, I can say that our soldiers and officers have demonstrated the best examples of mass heroism. The enemy used a large number of armored vehicles - this is 50 units. Of these, 39 units, including 26 tanks and 13 armored vehicles, were destroyed….The enemy was not successful in any of the areas of clashes. All counteroffensive attempts were stopped, and the enemy was driven back with heavy losses.”

Putin added: “Today they tried to pick up abandoned wrecked equipment, the wounded and the bodies of the dead, which they left yesterday on the battlefield…The enemy has very heavy losses of personnel — over 200 people. Unfortunately, we did not do without losses, but the difference is colossal, at times - more than ten times less than our enemy. “

Some key context: There has been little independent evidence of the state of the front lines in the south, but Russian military bloggers and official Ukrainian accounts suggest that Ukrainian forces have cut a path through at least one of the many minefields laid by the Russians and made modest territorial gains in the area of Robotyne, south of the town of Orikhiv.""",False,1690477798.0,t3_15arain,t3_15arain,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

This has a real interesting consequence for the Robotyne /Tokmak axis of attack. A couple months ago, I was looking at [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rRKs40IEbGRsV0Fhky25l5OkPJ_vUvQ&ll) of Russian and Belarusian Fortifications, which takes forever to load but is really good. I noticed that Russia had heavily fortified Bilmak/Kamianka. Note that this is the same town but for some reason has 2 different names. So I wondered why this random town was so heavily fortified. 

You see, if the the line south of Staromaiors'ke is penetrated, then the way to Bilmak/Kamianka lies open.  

It's easier to see on [this zoomed in map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rRKs40IEbGRsV0Fhky25l5OkPJ_vUvQ&ll=47.478854896179264%2C37.03493955058498&z=10) of Russian and Belarusian Fortifications, but Deepstate Map also shows [it here](https://deepstatemap.live/en&quot;#11/47.5355/36.7898) if you turn on the Russian fortifications filter. Both show heavy fortifications around Bilmak/Kamianka and also Staromaiors'ke to the north. 

The Map of Russian and Belarusian Fortifications and Deepstate shows the main railway for Russian logistics runs south Bilmak/Kamianka through Komysh-Zorya into Tokmak. Everyone is talking about the way to Mariupol being open once this line fails, I'm skeptical. My armchair general's dumbass wonders if the goal is instead to take Bilmak/Kamianka and thus cut the rail line south as a supporting effort to Tokmak, IE, to help choke off Tokmak from railway support. If the goal was to retake Crimea, then this would make more sense then a drive to Mariupol.

We may not know for years exactly what the motive for leaving the deal was (if it is any of these reasons or none of them), but I'm confident that it is a geopolitical blunder for Russia. 

Prior to this, the Black Sea Fleet could stay in the relative safety of Sevastopol. Now it has to be put at risk to blockade Ukraine. We could end up having a Moskva 2.0 that they wouldn't have had to risk if they'd extended the deal. Moreover, if the Russians play it cautiously to avoid a second Moskva level event, it could lead to ships flaunting the blockade demonstrating Russia's Navy's geopolitical weakness to project power in its own back yard.

Another interesting sidenote is that despite the Dems being more supportive of aid to Ukraine there was a correlation with older people being more supportive as well as white voters being more supportive than black voters.

- Ukraine has seen the most success around Bakhmut due to Russians not having dug in, not enjoying fire superiority, and unfavorable geography.

- Territorial progress can be a lagging indicator of the balance of attrition.

- Ukraine has switched to an attritional approach. Anecdotally, Ukraine's qualitative advantage in artillery fire does appear to be producing a favorable balance of attrition.

- But Russia has greater force availability overall and can retreat to prepared defensive lines.

- On the Orikhiv axis, we've seen the 10th Corps, meant to be a second echelon force, being increasingly committed, taking over from the 9th Corps. 9th Corps was unsuccessful or only partially successful in reaching the main Russian defensive belt.

- Offensive has not failed, but has not gone according to plan. ""To say that it's behind schedule or anticipated timelines is to put it very mildly and politely.""

- A significant percentage of Ukrainian forces has been committed to this fight in piecemeal form.

- ""I don't think Ukrainian reserves have been thrown into this fight. I think there's at least three forces, the first echelon, the second echelon, and the reserve force."" The second echelon is doing the job that the first echelon was supposed to complete.

- DPICMs will allow Ukraine to prosecute the offensive without culminating well into the fall.

- It's hard to have a breakthrough because minefields slow down soldiers, make it difficult to use vehicles.

- Russia is regenerating minefields and digging more trenches.

- It's unclear whether Russia has the reserves to maintain a defence in depth.

- ""I don't think they [Russia] are flush with reserves and certainly not with operationally ready reserves.""

- While offensive hasn't failed, ""pretty clear that the new brigades have not been successful"".

- Veteran brigades has consistently outperformed new brigades despite lacking the new equipment. ""Most of them perform poorly and some of them very poorly"".

- Ukraine could have instead chosen to pull veteran brigades off the line and equipped them for the offensive instead or generated battalions within those brigades.

- Ukraine does not have the capacity to coordinate brigades at the level of brigade combat teams. At best, a brigade in action consists of two or three companies advancing with artillery support.

- Best thing western supporters can do is not to make Ukraine fight like a western force, but in the way they best know how.

- ""We haven't seen all the new brigades employed up until maybe about this morning, but it does look like the remainder of the newer units available to 10th Corps have been used in some way, shape, or form"".

- ""Some 9th Corps brigades were pulled off the line for weak performance.""

- Western equipment is much more survivable. Also has good nighttime capabilities, but Ukrainians were unable to make the most of it because of lack of training.

- Ukraine has an advantage in tube, but not MLRS, artillery.

- Russian military has been conserving and rationing ammunition, which Kofman observed at the front.

- Russia is constrained by ammunition, not artillery pieces, despite the destruction of the latter.

- Russian counterbattery relies on Lancet drones, FPV drones, and attack helicopters.

- Russian military is on the worse end of the attrition curve, but their lines are not thin or lacking for reserves.

- The shock effect of western equipment was squandered in the initial assault.

- The course of the offensive will become clearer in the coming days as the 10th Corps is fed into the fight.

- ""Based on the last seven weeks, I'm more pessimistic than I was at the outset."" However, Ukraine has adapted, and ""if the West can resource this strategy, it can create real problems for the Russian forces. I just don't know if they can achieve their objectives in the offensive pursuing it this way. I think they will definitely make gains, I think they will be able to get through some Russian lines, I don't know if they'll be able to get to their strategic objectives"".

- Ukrainian units in the field want man-portable forms of mine-clearing like APOBS.

- Western aid was based on the idea of enabling combined-arms mechanized assaults. Since that failed, so it should reorient to the needs of dismounted infantry.

- Ukraine needs ISR, drones, pick-up trucks, replacement parts, 3D-printing machines, night vision, and most of all, ammunition.

- F-16s are a long-term program, will not be relevant this year, and something of a red herring. Given that Ukraine has trouble performing land operations at scale, it cannot be assumed that they can easily integrate and coordinate the additional complexity of air power at the level of the USAF.

- In the coming days, monitor the Orikhiv axis for progress and see if 10th Corps can perform to judge where the offensive is going.

- Ukraine deployed some of the weaker units to defend the Svatove/Kremmina line. Russia took advantage of that vulnerability and achieved a minor breakthrough there. Ukraine will likely deploy reserves to stem the advance.",False,1690477928.0,t3_15arain,t1_jtookhm,,1,41,0,41,0,0,

They had been consolidating those gains for a couple of weeks, but now it sounds like things are back on.  Russian fortifications are thinner here than on the western flank along the river.  There is really just one trench line, and it starts about 7km south of Staromaiors'ke, around Staromlynivka.

A breakthrough of just another 20km or so would put nearly the entire ""land bridge"" (including Mariupol) under potential Ukrainian fire control.  
  
An advance of more than 20km could potentially collapse both the Avdiivka and Tokmak fronts to some degree, and force Russians to quickly redeploy to significantly less favorable defensive positions, or give up significant ground.  This would also put the southern rail line in range of 155mm artillery.  
  
An advance of 50km would put Ukraine in direct control of the only railway currently supplying the Russian southern defenses and effectively cut off some 200k Russian soldiers.

It certainly wasn't the case that the Soviet Union kindheartedly gifted the Polish their lands, but Poland actually could have been treated a lot worse post-ww2. They at least had the decency to compensate Poland for the land they robbed from them (after invading them, simultaneously with the Nazis). Also, worth mentioning that parts of those lands the Soviet Union took after the deal with the Nazis, were originally not Polish homelands. Lviv and Vilnius (which now is the Lithuanian capital) were Polish pre-WW2.

The history of Eastern Europe is pretty complicated in terms of how national identities evolved, but ironically, I think that territorial changes post-ww2 actually were overall stabilizing and in the long term were pretty much the best possible outcome and came to a satisfying conclusion for everyone involved (apparently except Russia) after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which gladly didn't lead to a Yugoslavia like situation.

•	A significant percentage of Ukrainian forces has been committed to this fight in piecemeal form.

•	Veteran brigades has consistently outperformed new brigades despite lacking the new equipment. ""Most of them perform poorly and some of them very poorly"".

•	Ukraine does not have the capacity to coordinate brigades at the level of brigade combat teams. At best, a brigade in action consists of two or three companies advancing with artillery support.

•	Western equipment is much more survivable. Also has good nighttime capabilities, but Ukrainians were unable to make the most of it because of lack of training.

•	The shock effect of western equipment was squandered in the initial assault.

This leads me to believe three things:

1. There seems to be a divide in the long term strategic thinking of Ukrainian civilian leadership, senior military staff and western military partners.  Somebody making the decisions on how the war is to be fought wants the focus of the counter offensive to not just be regaining territory, but to make it so Russia doesn't have the capability of invading again for a long, long time.
2. There is a deep divide in strategic approach, even within the NATO countries, on how wars are fought.  The kind of slow moving, pains taking gains that minimizes your force's casualties is what I would expect from the European NATO members' land forces who trained these guys.
3. Veteran brigades are doing better because they understand Ukrainian military doctrine better than new  recruits.  It takes decades for a military to change gears, and Ukraine's doctrine, due to lack of money and weapons, was probably to train in smalls units with native artillery support  (like BTGs) so their commanders never got to practice on a large scale.

it’s the reserves bit and talk of a full mechanised push that has me suspicious/dubious as I’ve only seen this coming out of the NYT article and I am deeply suspicious of their reporting motivations.

Wagner's mutiny changed everything, and now Putin has to worry about his grip on power in ways he didn't before. If this is compounded with battlefield failures for Russia, this war is going to escalate in ways that take us all out of our comfort zones. This is no reason for Ukraine to be deterred, but the cost of freedom can be very high. 

Btw this comment has very little to do with ZNPP and nothing to do with other types of nuclear escalation. Russian is just going to test the waters in any area in which they feel plausible deniability is possible, or where there is too much ambiguity in the potential NATO response to a particular action. For example, I'm aware of three instances where Ukraine has reported the use of chemical weapons by Russia. Two of these were PS gas or something similar to tear gas. The most recent incident was allegedly lewisite, or basically a step up the escalation ladder from tear gas.

The maps show ~three lines of steady fortifications in most of the frontline.  In the NE Tokmak area the first one runs south of Robotyne, and NW of Verbove.  There could be fighting in between Robotyne and Verbove, but I don't think we've seen confirmation of this yet.

For /u/ScreenshotDump and others wondering about how we find this stuff, most of the maps show lines of defenses. Often they slow things down a bit so you have to click somewhere to turn them on.  These are usually built as map (gis) objects via OSINT from mostly satellite images, and probably all come from the same 1-2 people making those lists.  These often don't distinguish between ""forward fortifications"" and ""the main lines"" though, but when you read someone knowledgeable like Kaufman talking about them you can find it on a map and that really helps in memory.

* [ISW map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=9f04944a2fe84edab9da31750c2b15eb) just has it in there by default, and is very fast.  They typically lag in updates though (requiring lots of confirmation).  [Here's](https://arcg.is/1K0vK4) a closeup of the area.

* [Andrew Perpetua's map](https://map.ukrdailyupdate.com/) is the one I've been looking at most of late.

The first line is meant to be 'elastic', or delay rather than try and make a full stop before falling back. The 2nd and 3rd lines (where the 1st line falls back to) is much more heavily defended and not meant to break.

That's how defense in depth is supposed to work in theory. In theory the front line slows down the enemy and then they can manage an orderly retreat without breaking to the second line and if absolutely necessary then the third line. Each successive line is supposed to get harder and the entire purpose is to avoid a rapid breakdown and encirclement.

Whether things actually work out that way is another question. For instance if the defender overcommits to defending the frontline it can end badly. Similarly an organized retreat is also not necessarily easy to pull off and if it can't be done well then the stronger lines farther back might be less defended.

I think it's a mistake to assume that the second line will automatically be easier than the first but it's also a mistake to assume that the first line is the easiest and everything afterwards will be more difficult.

The use of Dragons teeth isn’t so much an issue, they can provide a tactical(and strategic advantage if you use them correctly. They prevent enemy armor from rushing your positions. Enemy will have to clear an area of defenders using mostly infantry in order to get their heavy engineering equipment safely in position without getting destroyed. If your using defense in depth, that also gives you time to strategically withdraw and fall back, as the enemy will have to spend time removing them… if you have artillery and decent recon, you can’t also concentrate fire on the area they start to clear.

Russia is just fucking stupid about it. They built long lines of dragon teeth all of the place without actually having any forces there to defend them in a meaningful way. Instead of forcing Ukraine to attack an area of their choice, they’re encouraging Ukraine to just find an undefended area, and cross there. If you look Ukraine made their push right at the gap between two of the lines and apparently didn’t bother to mine the fields around the area either. And Ukranian soldiers are literally standing in a field watching some dumb fuck Russian soldier record them driving a BTR into a ditch, so clearly they have no armor or artillery support in place.

Damn dude, are you a Karen or what?!

You are literally the racist lady screaming about how it's actually discrimination against *them* because their intolerance isn't celebrated while they they are acting like such a hateful POS. 

>Like i said, i am not out there shooting people based on what they look or think, RUSSIANS ARE.

ALL Russians are ""out there shooting people""? Or are only a few of the more than 144 million people who had no choice where or when they were born?

Are any of the Russians ""out there shooting people"" forcibly placed in those circumstances even under pain of death or intimidation of their families?

So again, sorry it's lost on your black/white brain, when you paint whole groups negatively based on circumstances outside that groups control and try to claim,

""well they *ALL* do it"" ... 

That's discrimination! And guess what?! That does make you wrong!",False,1690494094.0,t3_15arain,t1_jtpwbr0,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
