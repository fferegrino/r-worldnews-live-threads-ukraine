Since May, the Russian regular army and the private military company ""Wagner"" have lost between 20,000 - 30,000 soldiers killed and wounded in their attempts to capture #Bakhmut, said Ian Stubbs, senior military adviser to the British delegation to the OSCE.

""These are huge human losses with a total advance of about 25 kilometers,"" he said at the Security Forum in Vienna, noting that thus ""for every kilometer covered there are more than 800 Russian soldiers killed or wounded, most of whom are Wagner mercenaries.""

According to Stubbs, the owner of the PMC, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is becoming increasingly difficult to replenish its ranks for the ""meat grinder"" in eastern Ukraine.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 March 2023.  


* Over the last week, Russian attempts to assault the Donetsk Oblast town of Vuhledar have almost certainly slowed. This follows repeated, extremely costly failed attacks over the previous three months.  

* One factor in Russia’s heavy losses in this sector has been Ukraine’s successful adoption of Remote Anti-Armour Mine systems (RAAM). RAAM is a specialist artillery shell which scatters anti-armour mines up to 17km away from the firing unit.  

* In some instances, Ukraine has launched the mines over and behind advancing Russian units, causing disarray when Russian vehicles attempt to withdraw.  

* Russia’s only notable recent tactical success has been in the Bakhmut sector, which is dominated by Wagner Group mercenary forces, currently engaged in a public feud with the Russian Ministry of Defence.  

* There is a realistic possibility that Russia’s MoD has been insistent in its drive for success in Vuhledar, partially because it wants its own success to compete with Wagner’s achievements.

He was first sent to Kharkiv, where they put concrete slabs over a dam (maybe to appear that was useable crossing) but they mined them and were able to ambush the Russians. 

In May, his unit was transferred to Donetsk.  They’re assignment one day was to “clear” a strip of woods.  But they met an ambush.  To get away, they had to cross a field, where of course there’s little cover.

They’re helping wounded out, and he’s shot in his right hand by a sniper. Finger blown off, but still in glove.  They pause.  He’s then shot in left forearm, shattering the bone.  The guys tied tourniquets, to try to stop the bleeding. 

Guys try to escape, but theyre exposed in the field; they try to crawl, even the injure try to crawl to safety.  Some made it.  He didn’t.  His wounds meant he couldn’t crawl.  He also couldn't stand—the bloodloss made him faint.  He used his last bit of energy to spread out a mosquito net, bc even in the immense pain, the mosquitoes were annoying.  The Russians shot other wounded men, Fin says.

He would lie there for three days.  Bleeding out, dehydrating, and developing gangrene, then sepsis. 
His brothers petitioned for a posthumous hero’s medal to be awarded.  

After two nights lying in the field, licking stagnant water from ground and eating blades of grass, he became delusional.  He swore he was being rescued.  He swore his brothers were right there saying they’re rescuing him.  But then they’d disappeared.  He’d see drinks... Then he had delusion of Russians coming—no, these are real Russians, scoot away from puddle to hide in grass better!—must’ve not hid well bc they call out to him, ask him who he was with, he looks, see Ukrainian uniforms—it’s Airbourne Assault troops!  He could hardly believe they walked out there openly; they rescue him (frontline likely moved).

He was at deaths door.  Every doctor he saw was stunned he survived—organs had already shut down, severe blood loss, renal failure.
The sepsis from infected wounds was quite severe.  The gangrene ended up taking his entire arm, all the way up to his shoulder.

When interviewed, guess what he’s looking forward to? Getting back out there!  He knows missing a limb means he’s “not fit for service,” but he’s sure he can do managerial tasks of his division, or office work for the guardsmen, or help with training.  He’s eager to master his new prosthetic—courtesy of Poland—so he can go help his brothers, once again.

He says he was quite embarrassed when he received notice that he was to be given Ukraine’s highest medal, because he “hadn’t done anything!”  He learned his brothers—believing he was dead—submitted petition.  They amended, and Zelensky still awarded him the highest honor.

I’ve noted some discussion about the veracity of Ukraine’s claims of killing a little over 6k Russian soldiers in the last week.

I personally see the Ukrainian claims believable because it is consistent with what’s happening on the battlefield.

When an army is taking a high number of casualties it’s internal communication becomes severely disrupted. Dead people can’t communicate, and the new people sent to fill the gap have to start again. This translates to slow changes in tactics and communication.

Russia has never had much of a NCO component and so has always been very slow to adjust its tactics to events that happen in the battlefield.

However, this has become extreme recently. The Advances in Vulnedar, Advikia, and Bakmut seem to be planned days to week ahead and seem to keep grinding on even when they are met with disastrous losses.

This is consistent with a military that is losing 6k personnel a week.

About the only “argument” I’ve seen against Ukraine’s published Russian KIAs is a general belief that all countries lie about the opposition’s losses.

There is an exception to this rule, it’s when they don’t need to lie.

I contend that Ukraine doesn’t need to lie about Russia’s losses, they are huge. Simply publishing the truth in this situation is far more useful for Ukraines interests.",False,1679001585.0,t3_11sjlcy,t3_11sjlcy,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

That's not quite correct. Between the initial invasion force, later reinforcements, Wagner and mobilized, Russia had like what? 750k soldiers in total in this war. Ukraine claims 160k KILLED. Usually, causalities (killed + heavily wounded/maimed) to killed ratio is like 3-4. That would mean more than half of all russian soldiers already out of the conflict. There is no way the russia army would be able to keep its cohesion under such losses. I think what we see from the battlefield (The russian army is NOT yet collapsing and has at least enough manpower to cover the frontline) is that the Ukrainian numbers for killed russians is close to Russias total causalities.

This was subsequently picked up by many twitter accounts as most poor information is.

Just recently Julia Ioffe wrote about DeSantis and his stance on Ukraine. For an outsider such as myself it was enlightening.  

It is believed there are a number of reasons why Republicans or conservatives would not want to support Ukraine.  

I'll start off with a quote about DeSantis from Julia's paywalled article:  
>Some of it, however, is just good, old-fashioned politics. Before he was against it, DeSantis was very much for sending aid to Ukraine. In 2014 and 2015, when Putin first invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea, then-Congressman DeSantis had a lot to say about a different Democratic president, Barack Obama. That time, though, he wasn’t mad that Obama was sending blank checks to some faraway country, getting the U.S. bogged down in a war of escalation that was not a vital national security interest. No, he was mad at just the opposite, that Obama wasn’t doing enough. “We in the Congress have been urging the president, I’ve been, to provide arms to Ukraine,” DeSantis said at the time. “They want to fight their good fight. They’re not asking us to fight it for them. And the president has steadfastly refused. And I think that that’s a mistake.”  

>He went on: “I think that when someone like Putin sees Obama being indecisive, I think that whets his appetite to create more trouble in the area. And I think if we were to arm the Ukrainians, I think that would send a strong signal to him that he shouldn’t be going any further.”  

Julia also mentioned that it's far easier for the Republicans and conservatives to hate China than Russia. They may see jobs being moved to China, blame them for the COVID pandemic (Trump worked at blaming China too) and they may hate China due to communism.  

They may not dislike Russia so much as they share similar goals. Putin is seen as, and I utterly loath using this phrase, anti-woke. Putin is seen by many as a strong white male who is anti-gay.

With a couple of exceptions, these are likely to be real. Ammunition supply is not ubiquitous, so there are front line troops running out. Trench warfare is also about as unpleasant as can be - your nationality doesn't stop you practically drowning in mud whilst being freezing. Whilst some commanders are doing great at integrating NATO practices, such as allowing NCOs to request artillery on targets, others are distinctly in the Soviet I-know-better camp which can cause friction - especially if you're used to good command, suddenly having a crap commander stands out and makes it more likely that you complain than if it was just crap the whole time.

There are a couple of exceptions where Russia has fabricated videos, mostly with respect to war crimes.

This makes sense, and not in the way your probably thinking.

There have been a couple of videos in the last week about how the US Army has [Training and Doctrine Command](https://www.tradoc.army.mil/) ([TRADOC](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GEQQScAfvH0), link goes to short video about what it does), with NATO nations probably having something similar.  All US soldiers get trained the same way to fight the same way, with the same things emphasize, like OPSEC.

If the videos are correct, Russia doesn't have this.  Training and education can vary from location to location, with none of them coordinating their lessons, or lessons learned form the battlefield.  This is why we've seen the same type of attacks on Vuhledar over and over using the same tactics.

Not thinking of your Army as a whole but more of a collection of parts (regiments) is a very 19th century, or at least pre-WW I, military mindset. They may have weapon technology from the 20th and 21st centuries, but not thinking how ""my"" individual actions can put my whole unit at risk, and how modern communications tech like cell phones with instant messaging just amplifies the threat, shows that the individual soldiers' mindsets are stuck there too.

There is no way to tell. Moreover, there are like 10-20 videos a day, and you might see similar number of hits. How can you confir

Btw. General Staff numbers do not indicate if they count deaths or deaths plus wounded. If general ratio is like 1 dead to 3 wounded, then if they count only dead, that would mean 130k dead + 400k wounded, that would mean about 530k casualties, which would be entire initial Russian invading force of 200k + entire 300k mobilized + 30k Wagner all gone. I doubt that.

If they count both killed and wounded in their number, than it would mean only 30k total dead, which I would say is much less than reality.

For me, neither makes any sense. 

Western intelligence agencies estimate about 200k dead + wounded, which would be about 50k killed and 150k wounded. Which is consistent with Mediazona+Belingcat investigations inside Russia: they estimate about 30k dead Russian regulars (of that almost 15k already confirmed by name) + 30k dead Wagner and DPR+LPR, so about 60k total dead (and with that of course another 180k wounded).",False,1678963148.0,t3_11sjlcy,t1_jcevwey,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Russia's administration cares more about control/dominance over its domain than better livelihood for its citizens; that makes trade a zero-sum game-of-dominance for them rather than an everyone-benefits deal, and if other countries don't pay attention, they will let Russia vie for influence/control over them rather than gaining influence over Russia.
