Russia was heavily depending on false flags and propaganda to justify pushing into Ukraine without massive international consequences. The global backlash today was astounding - the Ruble basically collapsed; Russian oligarchs have lost about $50B USD and counting; every major Russian media outlet has been taken down by independent hackers; Russia is having its assets and accounts seized and being kicked out of marketplaces globally. Internally, they have massive protests in over 50 cities.

In Ukraine, their first day of invasion went markedly worse than expected. They failed to take Hostomel airport in an embarrassing loss, damaging their ability to get troops deep into Ukraine. An entire Russian platoon surrendered when they learned their mission was an invasion of Ukraine.

I'm sure Putin has basically infinite resources and doesn't care about blood spilt, but from a logistical perspective, today seems to have proven that he's not going to take Ukraine in a day or even a week, and Russia's economy and society simply can't endure a pointless protracted war.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water.

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Польський уряд запустив спеціальний сайт, щоб допомогти вам: ua.gov.pl

Будь ласка, поділіться цією інформацією, якщо ви знаєте когось, хто зараз шукає допомоги.

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.",False,1645747008.0,t3_t0p57k,t3_t0p57k,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Best case scenario but least likely: the Russian people continue to protest and once the oligarchs start having their pockets hit by the sanctions between them and the people a coup is staged and Putin is deposed.

Worst case scenario and the path we seem to be on currently is Ukraine puts up a fight but is overwhelmed by Russian forces. Putin, on a mad craze to rebuild the Soviet Empire, marches on Maldova, Georgia and eventually NATO allied Estonia, Latvia, & Poland which triggers are response from NATO and starts another world war.

A safer and hopefully more likely option: Ukraine continues to put up a fight and the sanctions plus an unplanned for Ukrainian resolve lengthens this war longer than Putin had planned and due to economic ruin from sanctions & a longer war combined with the threat of oligarchs with bleeding pockets, he's forced to settle for just the DNR & LNR",False,1645749358.0,t3_t0p57k,t3_t0p57k,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Sanctions are a good move. Holding out on further sanctions gives us bargaining power if the situation continues to escalate. Unfortunately it will take time for the effects to be felt, but hopefully it will cause further division between Russian citizens and the oligarchy. 

Lots of people want an immediate solution but putting boots on the ground escalates things dramatically at the expense of everyone, especially those on the front line. It seems like we are still gathering intelligence and communicating with other world leaders, and I think that is a good and diplomatic move. 

The reporters asked some silly questions, how can you expect Biden to predict the future about how China will react, if Putin will move past Ukraine, what exactly he meant by a vague threat, or how the stock market will handle it? 

I'm not a huge Biden fan, but people who are on his case for smirking at the ridiculousness of the reporters need to chill. There are more important things to be upset about.

I think that Putin didn't see the stock market collapse and the ruble devaluation coming.  I think he thought that the invasion would make him popular and misplayed his hand.  I also think he thought the world was more divided than it actually is.  And now I think he has to keep going because to pull back now would mean his ultimate downfall .  Lastly i think he's going absolutely insane about the intel leaks that seem to be predicting everything he is going to do.  Down to the hour of when things will happen.  I believe that it's driving him mad!

That being said, it’s with a heavy heart that, given Putin’s actions and statements, you may need to be very careful. If he chooses to go the route of full fascist dictator, your posts on social media may leave you vulnerable to reprisal by his government and its enforcement arm - or even fellow citizens who buy the propaganda.

Please, consider doing the following:

Scrub your Reddit account of personally identifying information. This includes your name, if any post celebrates or references your birthday, pictures of you, your family, or pets, and anything else that may be traced back to you.

Always connect to Reddit from behind a VPN.

Consider deleting critical posts from Russian-language social media.

If you were educated in the West, it’s likely you’ll be considered naturally suspicious… especially if things do not go Putin’s way. Consider leaving sooner rather than later. Applying for asylum in a European country may be wise for you.

Stay safe. You are all victims as much as Ukraine is.

Those who possess sol Invictus are truly impossible to completely conquer because they will fight to the last man. The people of Ukraine currently have that indomitable spirit within them. They have an indomitable spirit because they are fighting for what is good and in their hearts they know it's true. This spirit is a force multiplier that trumps anything because it lives in the heart of the people and cannot be extinguished until the last man is killed. The Russian troops are not dumb.

Salut mes baguettes, voilà un petit template de mail que j'ai écrit, si jamais vous voulez contacter votre député ! 

Merci à u/RozellaTriggs pour l'initiative

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Cher Monsieur/Chère Madame,

Je me permets de vous écrire en tant qu'habitant de (ville), et citoyen de la (chiffre) circonscription de (département)

L'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Russie est une infraction inadmissible au droit international, et la France et l'Europe se doivent de répondre avec force. Il en va de la sécurité de notre continent et de la crédibilité de la France et de l'Union pour les décennies à venir.

Je crois que la France a un vrai rôle de leader à jouer, en proposant de nouvelles sanctions, car elles sont aujourd'hui bien trop timorées.

C'est pourquoi, je vous demande de porter au nom de nos concitoyens et devant le Sénat la proposition suivante :

\- Ordonner la saisie des bien et l'immobilisation des actifs se trouvant en France, des oligarques russes soutenant le régime. Il est insoutenable de constater que deux jours après l'entrée en guerre, Roman Abramovich se prélassait entre son immense villa et son yacht à Antibes.

Au-delà, je compte sur vous pour défendre au plus haut niveau de l'Etat l'idée que la France soutienne sans réserves au niveau européen un bannissement de la Russie du système bancaire SWIFT, et l'élargissement des sanctions à la Biélorussie qui est complice de crimes de guerre.

Merci pour votre lecture,

Je compte sur vous.

The US has had nuclear defense systems in place since the Gulf War and have tested them successfully (these systems even have the ability to shoot down satellites). Although these defense systems can stop a few nuclear weapons, Russia (allegedly) has thousands of nuclear missiles and these defense systems, in all likelihood, won't be able to stop a full scale attack.

Instead of stopping nuclear weapons directly or retaliating with their own nuclear weapons, I think the US has measures in place to stop most, if not all, telecommunications in Russia. The US has publicly said they have weapons in space (although it's unknown to what extent) and the approach they could take would be to destroy satellites or use other methods such as EMPs to damage the telecommunication systems that these nuclear weapons (i.e. ICBMs) rely on. Without technologies such as GPS, Russian nuclear weapons will have a very tough time getting anywhere they want to go.

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl

Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!

EDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:

Очистите свой аккаунт на Reddit от личной идентифицирующей информации. Это включает ваше имя, если в каком-либо сообщении отмечается или упоминается ваш день рождения, фотографии вас, вашей семьи или домашних животных, а также все остальное, что может быть отслежено до вас.

Рассмотрите возможность удаления критических сообщений из русскоязычных социальных сетей.

>> A report from Janes, the defense intelligence firm, found that Russian forces crossing the border near Kharkiv “appear to have become bogged down in heavy fighting.” Images from social media, the Janes report said, indicate that “some armored columns have been ambushed.”
>> 
>> The longer and better the Ukrainian forces fight, the more time Ukraine has to prepare insurgent operations and the more pain they can inflict on Moscow’s forces, Mr. Kagan said.
>> 
>> “We really have to consider the possibility that Putin expected the Ukrainians to fold and did not expect them to fight,” Mr. Kagan said, noting that the initial missile barrage on Ukraine had been limited to about 100 strikes.
>> 
>> Mr. Putin has done little to prepare the Russian public for a long fight, and the longer the Ukrainians hold on, the more they might be able to undermine the Russian president’s standing.

Also apparently Russia has been defeated at Hostomel airport. They were reportedly supposed to land airborne forces there, but without air superiority and Ukraine crawling with western supplied shoulder mounted AA missiles, how was that supposed to work?

Also videos of wrecked tank columns. Without sufficient air cover, again any ukrainian with a shoulder fired missile will ruin their day.

I'm even diving deep into right leaning and sympathetic sources as much as I reasonably can.

Covid conspiracies abound still, though Russia's involvement in the anti-vax movement before covid even started begin to unravel the mysteries there.

There's some discussion about putting this all on the failure of the Minsk protocol, I believe Venezuela was championing that and I'm sure that rolls into some of the fascist platform Putin is building. Then there's the obvious bold faced lies accusing Zelensky of heading a totalitarian Nazist regime.

nothing, they will circle around trying to sanction his inner circle, something they are expecting already, but they wont touch Putin himself, as far as I know the world is trying to avoid hurting the Russian people aswell, its like they are targeting Oligarch, but Russian people themselves needs to bleed ($ wise) so they wake up and protest this war.

so expect nothing, Putin will take Ukraine in a matter of days, China might feel compelled to do the same or wait until Putin takes another country and take Taiwan by surprise.

He won’t let Ukraine be a lengthy war though. He’s used the term “denazification” which means he’s more than willing to kill civilians. It’s a grim reality, but that’s why the wars why Iraq and Afghanistan were so elongated and unsuccessful, because the West is under far more global scrutiny and obviously doesn’t want to harm civilians if it can be avoided.

I’m not sure whether he’ll stop at Ukraine. He probably will though, until it all dies down, and a few years pass and he tries to take back more of the old USSR. Then we’ll go through all of this again.

We pray for your supernatural protection over all Ukrainians involved.

We pray they would have the courage to surrender and they would be blessed and protected for doing so. 
We pray for your swift vengeance on those who would perpetrate evil on the innocent. 
We pray that every single fighting man or woman would be filled with an indomitable courage to strike hard and fast at the enemy.
We pray their defense would be impenetrable. 
We pray their offense would be lethal.
We pray that your goodness and faithfulness would intervene and the entire world would be united in defense of the innocent. 
We pray for the Soldiers of Ukraine to be alert, that your word in Isaiah 40:31 would go before them. Your word says those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.
We pray that you would dispatch your ministering and warring angels alongside them. That they would fight with a precise lethality that shatters the resolve of the enemy.

Evening Recap, February 24, 2022:

The first full day of fighting has ended since our last recap. Ukrainian government sources announced that they have retaken the critical Hostomel air field near Kyiv from Russian forces that had been sent to secure it, as well as the Antonov air field in that vicinity. These were military objectives that Russia sought to take in order to facilitate the landing of air transports in their assault on the capital city. Ukrainian forces also began a counteroffensive in the South towards Kherson, an important city for Russia as it holds the canal that Russia sought to unblock to deliver water supplies to the Crimean peninsula. Ukrainian sources claim to have killed 350 Russian troops, though they claim to have sustained 137 deaths and 300 injured as well. Ukraine believes Russia has deployed 60 battalion tactical groups in the country at the moment, of 120 that Russia had amassed on its borders.

Still, US analysts believe that Kyiv is close to being encircled. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a statement to the nation, announced that saboteurs had already infiltrated the capital city as Russian and Belarusian forces advanced from the North, though he intended to stay in the city with his family. US intelligence has warned that Russian bombers will make a raid for Kyiv at 3AM local time (a little under an hour from now) as part of their ""decapitation"" strategy to take the city. While Ukrainian counteroffensives have taken place, Russian forces have also advanced extensively from Crimea over 100 km into the Ukrainian mainland. Shelling has also been heard in the port city of Mariupol in the Donbas, a critical port for Ukraine, and Russian forces continue to advance in an attempt to take the Southeastern city of Odessa on the Black Sea coast.

Albania and the United States intend to press the issue of a UN resolution to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though Russia is currently chair of the UN Security Council and also wields a veto on that body. President Biden is also dealing with the legality of potentially continuing to support Ukraine with lethal aid absent authorization from Congress. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that lawmakers in Washington wish to provide an additional $600 million in weapons to help Ukraine, and Republican Senators including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are pressing on President Biden to enact harsher sanctions.

""Flushing"" If you commit all your resources to a fight and get stuck in a bad situation because you don't really know where the other side is or what they're planning, that's game over for you.

Ukraine has the home turf. Russia needs to figure out what they're doing and where.

Right now (and hopefully it stays this way) it's not total war. Russia isn't just trying to defeat an entire country it just wants to take it over. If you didn't really mind destroying entire civilian population center, that's when a military and can basically just commit far more resources and blow up basically anything in front of them.

Long edit:
Let's just make a list shall we?  America lost in the following foreign wars:

Russian civil war

Korea

Vietnam

Nicaragua

Laos

Cuba

Somalia

Iraq

Afghanistan

Somalia again

Yemen

I'm counting these ongoing ones because we've been there for 20 years and it flies in the face of anything you have to say about Russia.  None of the countries listed are heavy hitters.  When America sent troops to fight the Bolsheviks, they were fighting a peasant army in a country that wasn't yet industrialized.  

Anybody with such a hard on for the US military that they have delusions that Russia would fold is absolutely crazy.   Russia is nearly undefeatable.  Whatever victory could be had militarily would be dwarfed by the costs in lives and economics.  

Idk if you're aware of the history, but Russia has a much better record in war than the US.  America has a losing record in war, especially since WW2.  For all of the money spent, it's really just went to the heads of Americans.  You don't think Russia has powerful weapons?  You don't think they can fight harder than any of the countries listed above?  Don't kid yourselves.  

Of all the countries on earth, Russia is the closest to being totally self sufficient. That's why sanctions don't work.  The sanctions we placed on Russia this week will do more damage to Europe and America than to Russia.  Actually, they might *help* Russia in the long run.  Not to mention china.  Russia is selling their Ural crude at a discount and guess who is the only people buying it.  Yeah, China.  While the rest of the world is paying higher prices for oil, China is getting a steep discount.  Europeans and Americans will pay higher prices for their energy and Russia will make more while china enjoys an advantage in prices.

Fallacies - appeals to emotion, gish gallops, and ad hominem are big indicators that someone is being disingenuous

Suspicious comment history - saying something pro-Ukraine but visiting pro-Russia subreddits regularly is disingenuous

Concern trolling - raising innocuous sounding but incredibly disingenuous questions, like ""why isn't Biden doing anything, doesn't he care?""

Spamming - most critically, these users will cross-comment their gish gallops across multiple subreddits and threads, verbatim. They'll delete comments that have received too much heat only to repost them slightly rephrased a few hours later.

Sympathetic but weirdly centrist language - facially, these posts *seem* sympathetic but ultimately come short of actually calling a spade a spade. It's because they don't want the discussion or the argument, they just want you to have read a sentiment and internalize it and repeat that the sentiment exists.

And for anyone who doubts how pervasive it is, it's actually pretty crazy. I encourage you to go ahead and engage these people in good faith, then check on these threads in a week or a month. To a man, every single person you'll have argued with is deleted. Karma only, no comment trails.

These are the big boys that hypothetically could take out ICBMs. Testing has been spotty and from what I was reading earlier today success if far from 100%. Also, Russia has more nukes than we can realistically counter. The projects had difficulty getting funded in the 90s and 2000s, and were never all that successful. Improvements have largely come in the form of smaller batteries for slower missiles. 

Additionally, we have anti-missile systems in Poland (and I believe Turkey), that's a big part of why Russia is so upset with Nato expanding. These systems, again, are far from full proof. And smaller systems (designed for smaller missiles, not so much ICBMs) in Hawaii and on ships in the navy.

The real defense is that (and again, I was reading this earlier today on light google searches and wikipedia) is that Russia would want to take out our ICBMs first, most are in hardened locations away from big population centers, deep under ground. So, publicly at least, Russia's said it would launch 2 missiles at each of our missile launch sites. That would account for a little over half of their arsenal. The remainder would likely target other specific military bases including our allies nuclear capabilities, and they'd want to hold some in reserve from additional threats. 

But, that's not all. Both the US and Russia have mobile launch capabilities. Bombs that can be delivered by planes and bombs that can be launched from submarines. Can we scramble jets to take out their bombers fast enough? Maybe. Can we find their subs before they launch? Much less likely. 

Additionally, the hypersonic stuff can take much different routes, bloombergs editorial board wrote about this last year arguing it was a waste to fund more missile defense systems when the Chinese Hypersonic glider could come up from the south pole and avoid virtually all our defenses. (hypothetically) 

MAD -Mutually Assured Destruction - is the real deterrent against use. They launch, we launch. They defend, we defend. Who is left standing? Anyone? Tough to guess.

But, I'm also skeptical of Nukes coming into play so long as we stop at driving Russians back into their existing boarders. We march on Moscow, then maybe they feel their backs are to the wall enough that they do something stupid.

In the past, if John in the US wanted to send George in the UK $100, he would go to his bank in New York, the bank would remove the money from his account, then they'd send a fax to George's bank in London asking them to please credit his account for $100. Requests were written by hand, took a long time, and were prone to error.

SWIFT is standardized way of rapidly and efficiently communicating these requests. Without access to it, businesses would start having trouble paying their suppliers on time, or collecting payments from customers, or sending money to family overseas, etc. It immediately removes 50 years worth of productivity gains in commercial banking from the excluded country.

Germany is opposed to it because Russia is their largest trade partner (after China), so SWIFT exclusion would hit their businesses very hard too, more so than sanctions which tend to be focused on certain organizations.

""An official familiar with current assessments said Russian shelling hit a radioactive waste repository at Chernobyl, and an increase in radiation levels was reported.

An official familiar with current assessments said Russian **shelling hit a radioactive waste repository** at Chernobyl, and an increase in radiation levels was reported. The increase could not be immediately corroborated.

Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashenko warned that **any attack on the waste repository could send radioactive dust** over “the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and countries of the EU.”

Grossi said it is “of vital importance that **the safe and secure operations of the nuclear facilities in that zone should not be affected or disrupted in any way**.″ ""

Click on the circle saying 65,500 to see the increase, as well as the same in surrounding areas including Pripyat. This isn't kicked-up dust.

""The NRC limits the handling and use of radioactive materials such that no member of the public will receive a radiation dose of 2 millirems in any one hour from external radiation sources in an unrestricted area""

2 millirems is 2.281 milliRoentgen.
1 milliRoentgen per hour (mR/h) is approximately 10,000 nanoSieverts per hour (nSv/h).

65,500 nSv/h is 6.55 mR/h. Över 3x the safe radiation dose limit, so hazardous to anyone in the area, but without fallout, the issue is obviously contained. More disturbing is that there are multiple other readings in the Chernobyl and Pripyat areas which are spiking, suggesting the contaminated area is spreading, as the waste is not being contained. This aligns with the assessment mentioned in the AP article: ""Ukrainian Interior Ministry adviser Anton Herashenko warned that **any attack on the waste repository could send radioactive dust** over “the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and countries of the EU.”""",False,1645750053.0,t3_t0p57k,t1_hybgub6,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Iraq's organized resistance was a pushover by 2003. Ukraine has far more modern air defenses, and a lot more sophisticated anti-armor weaponry.  

You can see the Russian aircraft having to fly low and pop a lot of countermeasures while dodging surface to air fire. US aircraft moved over Iraq with a fair amount of impunity. Iraqi anti-armor was far more limited to ambush strikes against the least-armored vehicles, rather than the images of destroyed tanks we're seeing from Ukraine.

So not really the same.  The US advance was steady and well-supported, against an enemy that had very little capability to do anything other than hunker down and try to defend the cities.

Based on the information that is publicly available, we can likely infer that the first day did not go as well as Russian forces hoped. However, they still managed to destroy a good amount of anti-air defense, radars and strike at buildings/bases/materiel from the air. 

So now it seems that when they are fighting on the ground, the Ukrainian forces can hold their own and are more motivated. But the Russian forces will have air superiority, which ultimately wins out. So long term it still seems likely that the Russian forces will achieve their goals.

Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR (Soviet Socialist Republic) until it gained independence following the USSR's collapse.

Yes, there are many hypocritical governments... The West buying and importing oil or gas, selling arms to Saudi Arabia, lying about WMDs in Iraq. It's all awful. 

However, responding directly to something positive (like a proper sanction for a country committing a war crime) with 'whataboutism' never helps. For example, our PM just announced that Russia should not be a part of SWIFT. 

A Russian bot would swoop in and say 'BUT BORIS' PARTY HAS SOLD WEAPONS TO CORRUPT MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES'. While that may be true, it doesn't mean that Russia shouldn't be sanctioned heavily. 

There's a lot that can be learned from the Ukraine crisis. The West have helped create this whole issue by relying on commodities from Russia and being complacent. Hopefully we can be more independent in the future and create a better system.

Afternoon Recap, February 24, 2022:

The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues in this initial phase. Ukrainian forces have lost ground in the South north of Crimea, where Russia has seized a critical canal that Ukraine had been blocking which supplied water to Crimea. Overnight, the Ukrainian military had also confirmed the losses of various villages in the Donbas region to pro-Russian separatists and Russian forces. In the North, Russian and Belarusian forces have pushed Ukrainian troops out of the Chernobyl containment zone, with President Zelensky stating that Russian attacks may have damaged some containment facilities at the site.

A critical fight is ensuing over Hostomel airport near Kyiv. Russian forces had previously seized the airport and Ukrainian troops have struggled to retake it. Should this location be seized by Russia, there is concern that Russian troops could use the airfield to bring in troops for an invasion of Kyiv. Ukraine has also reported downing several Russian jets and helicopters across the country as the fighting continues on all fronts. US defense officials, while noting that Ukraine has put up a strong fight, nevertheless believe that the capital will fall in the coming days.

In response to Russia's invasion, a summit of G7 leaders was held this morning and President Biden made further remarks in a press conference laying out an array of economic sanctions against Russian banks and American exports to Russia of certain technology. Biden also noted that cutting Russia off from SWIFT remains on the table, as well as personal sanctions on President Putin. President Biden also laid out additional measures that the US would take to shore up NATO's Eastern European flank, continuing to shift American troops from Italy and Germany to Eastern European nations in an effort to reassure those nations of the American commitment to NATO and also activating the NATO Response Force.

Nations across Eastern Europe are now also opening up their borders to take in Ukrainian refugees, with refugee camps set up in Moldova and Poland. These countries have previously affirmed commitments to accept millions of refugees fleeing the fighting. Ukrainians enjoy visa-free entry to the European Union.",False,1645751432.0,t3_t0p57k,t1_hybjzjp,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The first full day of fighting has ended since our last recap. Ukrainian government sources announced that they have retaken the critical Hostomel air field near Kyiv from Russian forces that had been sent to secure it, as well as the Antonov air field in that vicinity. These were military objectives that Russia sought to take in order to facilitate the landing of air transports in their assault on the capital city. Ukrainian forces also began a counteroffensive in the South towards Kherson, an important city for Russia as it holds the canal that Russia sought to unblock to deliver water supplies to the Crimean peninsula. Ukrainian sources claim to have killed 350 Russian troops, though they claim to have sustained 137 deaths and 300 injured as well. Ukraine believes Russia has deployed 60 battalion tactical groups in the country at the moment, of 120 that Russia had amassed on its borders.

Still, US analysts believe that Kyiv is close to being encircled. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a statement to the nation, announced that saboteurs had already infiltrated the capital city as Russian and Belarusian forces advanced from the North, though he intended to stay in the city with his family. US intelligence has warned that Russian bombers will make a raid for Kyiv at 3AM local time (a little under an hour from now) as part of their ""decapitation"" strategy to take the city. While Ukrainian counteroffensives have taken place, Russian forces have also advanced extensively from Crimea over 100 km into the Ukrainian mainland. Shelling has also been heard in the port city of Mariupol in the Donbas, a critical port for Ukraine, and Russian forces continue to advance in an attempt to take the Southeastern city of Odessa on the Black Sea coast.

Albania and the United States intend to press the issue of a UN resolution to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though Russia is currently chair of the UN Security Council and also wields a veto on that body. President Biden is also dealing with the legality of potentially continuing to support Ukraine with lethal aid absent authorization from Congress. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that lawmakers in Washington wish to provide an additional $600 million in weapons to help Ukraine, and Republican Senators including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are pressing on President Biden to enact harsher sanctions.",False,1645751420.0,t3_t0p57k,t1_hybjzjp,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

 Please consider doing the following:
 Clear your Reddit account of personally identifiable information.  This includes your name if any message mentions or mentions your birthday, photos of you, your family or pets, and anything else that can be traced back to you.
 Always connect to Reddit with a VPN.
 Consider removing critical posts from Russian-language social networks.
 If you've been educated in the West, chances are you'll be considered suspicious... especially if things don't go the way Putin wants.  Consider leaving sooner rather than later.  Perhaps you should apply for asylum in one of the European countries.

Evening Recap, February 24, 2022:

The first full day of fighting has ended since our last recap. Ukrainian government sources announced that they have retaken the critical Hostomel air field near Kyiv from Russian forces that had been sent to secure it, as well as the Antonov air field in that vicinity. These were military objectives that Russia sought to take in order to facilitate the landing of air transports in their assault on the capital city. Ukrainian forces also began a counteroffensive in the South towards Kherson, an important city for Russia as it holds the canal that Russia sought to unblock to deliver water supplies to the Crimean peninsula. Ukrainian sources claim to have killed 350 Russian troops, though they claim to have sustained 137 deaths and 300 injured as well. Ukraine believes Russia has deployed 60 battalion tactical groups in the country at the moment, of 120 that Russia had amassed on its borders.

Still, US analysts believe that Kyiv is close to being encircled. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a statement to the nation, announced that saboteurs had already infiltrated the capital city as Russian and Belarusian forces advanced from the North, though he intended to stay in the city with his family. US intelligence has warned that Russian bombers will make a raid for Kyiv at 3AM local time (a little under an hour from now) as part of their ""decapitation"" strategy to take the city. While Ukrainian counteroffensives have taken place, Russian forces have also advanced extensively from Crimea over 100 km into the Ukrainian mainland. Shelling has also been heard in the port city of Mariupol in the Donbas, a critical port for Ukraine, and Russian forces continue to advance in an attempt to take the Southeastern city of Odessa on the Black Sea coast.

Albania and the United States intend to press the issue of a UN resolution to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, though Russia is currently chair of the UN Security Council and also wields a veto on that body. President Biden is also dealing with the legality of potentially continuing to support Ukraine with lethal aid absent authorization from Congress. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that lawmakers in Washington wish to provide an additional $600 million in weapons to help Ukraine, and Republican Senators including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are pressing on President Biden to enact harsher sanctions.",False,1645751465.0,t3_t0p57k,t1_hybk73f,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

This isnt a smart move for anyone. Russia is getting sanctioned badly and her people clearly have a distaste for these actions. Trump has praised Putin for many things during his presidency for whatever reason. If anything this is par for the course.

Trump didnt decry any behaviour, and if anything this just cements his status as a well known idiot for seeing this as a ""peacekeeping"" operation. No missed context or anything. ""Winning"" and ""getting his way"" are not GOOD things to claim when its innocents are dying in their homes, and his actions are internationally reviled. 

Say whatever you want about Trump, but he clearly wanted to appease Putin as he tended to do.

Is my understanding of radiatión Levels correct? Right now in Chernóbil some stations report 65000 nSv/h Which Is 0.065mSv/h

""Above about 100 mSv, the probability of cancer (rather than the severity of illness) increases with dose. The estimated risk of fatal cancer is 5 of every 100 persons exposed to a dose of 1000 mSv (ie. if the normal incidence of fatal cancer were 25%, this dose would increase it to 30%).""
