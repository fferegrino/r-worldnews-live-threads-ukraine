Day 278 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, but we had a couple of air raid alerts which were uneventful for Kharkiv, but other towns/cities were hit. Kupiansk was hit a couple of times today, most likely with S-300 missiles both times. Then Dnipro was also hit with missiles in the evening, apparently they hit some company’s manufacturing facilities and there were no reported casualties.

Blackouts in Kharkiv still continue, but not everywhere. Some parts of the city literally never have blackouts, while others are without electricity almost the entire day. My apartment building had blackouts lasting 5-8 hours every day during the last 4 days. But then we look outside of our window and all the buildings on the other side of the street never have any blackouts, they are always lit up, which just sucks. Blackouts should be evenly divided between everyone, and not like it is now with some people never having electricity, while others never have any blackouts.

Pretty much everyone right now is predicting a new massive missile strike on our infrastructure tomorrow. Apparently there are 20 Tu-95s on standby right now, while during the previous missile strikes it was more like 10-11, so it is expected that this one might be much bigger than the previous ones. 

If it does happen then I’m not sure when I’ll be able to write next, we probably won’t have electricity for days or maybe even weeks, because the damage to our energy infrastructure worsens with each new missile strike. The biggest problem with having no electricity will be not being able to make food or boil water as we only have an electric stove, and the last gas tank we had for our portable gas stove has run out, so this will be horrible if we do indeed lose electricity for a long period of time.

Wanna know something funny about Uzbekistan?


In 1944 the Soviets wanted to ethnically cleanse Crimea (because of course they wanted to).


Their destination? Uzbekistan! 



Here are some fun numbers: 



- Crimea is 4000 km away from Uzbekistan (about 2.5k miles). 


- The journey is 72 hrs if you go by **cattle train**... Which is how 200k women, children and elderly were deported to Uzbekistan.



- The cleansing took three days. Think about that. (18-20 May 1944). 



- 97% of Crimean Tatars were deported from Crimea. 



- 8000 people died during transport. 



- At least 80k households were abandoned.

The administration of Russian-occupied Enerhodar has accused Ukraine of “actively spreading fakes” about a possible Russian withdrawal from the area.

Writing on Telegram, the occupying administration said “this information does not correspond to reality” and that Zaporizhzhia NPP “remains under Russian control.""

On Sunday, Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s nuclear energy provider, said the company had received information that Russian forces may be preparing to leave the facility.

Kotin emphasized that ""it is still too early to say that the Russian military is leaving the plant,’ but that they are ""preparing.""

However the Russian-backed administration said that Rosenegeatom, a Russian state-run firm, has announced plans to “create a back-up power supply source for Zaporizhzhia NPP."" 

A source at Rosenegeatom is quoted as saying that the company took into account ""the great importance of the power supply reserve for the nuclear safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, especially in winter.""

The International Atomic Energy Agency has not released any information supporting Kotin’s statement and CNN has reached out to the UN nuclear watchdog for comment.

Two things to keep in mind:

Russians know their phone conversations and public speech can be monitored by the FSB.  So their ""truth"" in public and their ""truth"" in private can be two different things (as is with most people, a concept we westerners, who live in free and open societies, find difficult to understand).  

And propaganda is highly effective if backed by even a smidge of truth.  For example, the mid-90s Balkans uprisings (or the Yugoslav Civil War).  From a **Russian perspective**, their close friend and ally, the Serbians, were the dominant political force in the federation of Yugoslavia.  As the dominant force, they had every right to do what they did to protect their ethnic brothers in other portions of the federation, just like the western backed country of Israel does with the Jews in the occupied Palestinian territories.  Then, NATO, a ""defensive"" alliance invaded a non-NATO Serbia (Kosovo, while disputed, is still a province of Serbia) to protect Muslim Albanian terrorists in 1999.

&#x200B;

Right now there is a small grain of doubt amongst the Russian population that what they're being told, that the United States through their puppet  NATO are only actively supporting Ukraine to humiliate Russia, is false.  If Ukraine were to be given ""the good stuff"" in the NATO arsenal this grain would be removed, any peace to be had after this war is over will be impossible.  Why?  Because if the Russian army lost to a fully armed NATO, all they will do is slink back to Mordor and rearm themselves and try this again with a non-NATO backed country (like Kazakhstan).

End users are distributed throughout the globe.  

A particular bank or financial institution is not, especially if they operate primarily in one country.  They are likely in 2 or 3 physical datacenters within that particular country, or 3-6 virtual datacenters (cloud).  If you are a financial institution, locating your systems/data outside of the country you operate in exposes you to jurisdictions that your own country does not control - so you don't do it unless you have no other recourse.

Even moderately big regional banks will only have a handful of either physical or virtual datacenters - and the virtual datacenters (what you're referring to as the cloud) - are in physical datacenters operated by your cloud provider, and the location of those datacenters is not a secret.

There are 18 AWS datacenters in North America, around about the same number of Microsoft Azure datacenters, most organizations will only use two groups of 3 at most, and it would be trivial from an infosec perspective to figure out which specific ones for a given organization.

In France, there are 3 AWS datacenters all near Paris, and only 4 or 5 Azure datacenters, split between Paris and Marseille.

And on top of that - there are service providers that provide key network interconnects for network services and cloud providers - you figure out where and hit those, you can probably take down DOZENS of fincancial companies all at once, irrespective of their physical or vitrtual datacenters.

Ukraine isn't anywhere near as big as the USA nor do their financial really operate regionally/globally.

Now all of that being said - I do recollect hearing that Microsoft was helping to ""decentralize"" their infrastructure (can't recall if it was federal or financial) - but yes I sure hope they've spent the past 9 months shifting their platforms into virtual datacenters in Europe.

Another problem for Russia would be morale for Russia if they lose, that'd shatter the popularity for a war amongst its populace. Because nobody wants to fight a losing war.

Nothing. Even if Russia is driven out, they have people and vehicles. They've got and are making and buying more missiles and drones. Even if Ukraine retakes all their territory, Russia can keep sending missiles and drones to target cities and infrastructure.

Ukraine can't stop this without going into Russia and physically destroying those factories. It can't stop Russia buying Iranian drones. 

This is why people keep saying the war has to end in negotiations. Even if Ukraine wins in Ukraine, it can't force an end to the war without outright conquering Russia, which isn't happening for a number of reasons. Russia can pull back in the Russia, restore more tanks, make more shells, train more troops and launch an attack again. And bomb Ukraine whenever it feels like it. It can keep fighting this war for years. The question is, is it willing to keep fighting for years?

Russia has to be willing to end this for it to end. The same is true of Ukraine. Both sides have to find an agreement that they will accept. Right now, there isn't one and so the fighting continues. And the fighting will continue until the results on the battlefield change what the sides are willing to accept. That is how this war will end. And it's the reason WWII was so long and destructive. There was never a point where the two sides would accept a compromise, and so it was fought to the bitter, bloody, unconditional surrender end.

So, what might the final peace look like? No one really knows. 

And after that peace, whatever it is, what stops Russia from trying again? Nothing, unless Ukraine joins an alliance. Russia is extremely unlikely to attack a member of NATO. It is only slightly more likely to attack a member of the EU. How likely is Russia to attack a Ukraine that isn't part of an alliance, no one knows.

At this point it's not a question of *if* Ukraine can push them out, it's only a matter of *when*. Ukraine has the home-field advantage, the weaponry advantage, the logistical advantage, the training advantage, and the technological advantage... the only thing the Russians have is numbers, and that's not helping them much, given the Mobik's incompetence and propensity for drunkenness if given the opportunity (never mind the fact that many/most of their soldiers aren't equipped for the fight or if they are they've got WW1 era weapons and ""armor"").

Ukrainians should leave crates of vodka in any position they abandon, or if possible air-drop/smuggle them in to any position they intend to attack. Come back in 8 hours when the fuckers are piss drunk and just kill them all while they're passed out or hung over (can you imagine trying to shoot a gun while nursing a hangover? OOOF).

In the even that the officers take it all for themselves or confiscate it to keep the mobiks from getting drunk, then they've got a bunch of alcoholic troops in withdrawal who would do anything for a nip, and then you've created in-fighting within the enemy's ranks. It's still a win.

They just can’t allow Ukraine make its own decisions and Ukraine can not decide where it wants to go and do what it wants. They try to justify it with “Ukraine has unique geopolitical position”.

I'll believe that. The younger generation in the most developed areas, that had the most exposure to independants media (western or otherwise) know the truth of the situaion, but most other Russians get the mushroom tretment.

No. Russia could easily have demanded that Ukraine remains out of Nato, it had more than enough soft power to do that. They would have kept Crimea and could even made the case for semi independant separatist republics. Putin needed a big and easy win and Ukraine seemed like a big fat target. Wrong decisions on wrong info. Still totally their fault, don't go sharing blame.

Yes, let's punish ex-soviet block republics forever by restricting their right to align with whoever they choose.

Sometimes it’s all unclear.  

For example, the big story over the weekend in WSJ of the largest Kherson hospital’s operations during occupation.  One collaborator-doctor stopped collaborating several weeks prior to withdrawal, he stayed. Then, he tried to go back to hospital and folks were like, “yo, get out you collaborator.”   He’s still there in Kherson rt bank, he told WSJ that the SBU has not come a-knocking, yet.  His case is murky bc he initially collaborated, then defied.  It’s possible that he was a plant—Russians had installed him as second in command at the hospital.  Others must’ve stuck around, too, Bc I keep seeing arrests announced.

It's because casually that is indeed the the perception one could get. For example, it's quite facile to come to the conclusion that because Western arms companies benefit by selling their wares, that they would be behind the scenes prolonging the conflict. Or that a methodically worn-down Russia will end up more depleted than one that simply lost and had to withdraw, so the Western powers are guiding the conflict towards a prolonged attrition rather than a speedy end. 

The memetic cling of conspiracy theories is that they should contain a kernel of truth, and enough vagueness about their other details that they can get morphed and overstated enough to fit the given pattern. Both those factors apply here. 

Yes, the Western arms companies, and some not-so-Western, are getting the chance to test and sell their wares with this big shooting war that has emerged. That fact is undeniable. 

The fog of war covers the rest — the messy details that might disprove any hypothesis that the West is pulling shady shit. 

The thing is, the war has been incredibly disruptive to the world economy. Sitting governments never, ever like that when their country is affected, the the effect is global. So that makes them unlikely to want it to continue for selfish reasons — basic human decency could also come into play, and I believe it does, but it's not important to the argument. Likewise the arms manufacturers are already looking forward to a huge boon as happens whenever the global balance shifts. And the shift has happened already — they don't need to *do* anything to make it happen to reap the rewards.  So again they can at this point push the humanitarian angle and focus on developing goodwill instead — this reasoning again does not require human decency, although again that is also an option. Self-interest from both the governments and the arms companies belie the conspiracy theory: like all such theories questioning the assumptions and thinking them through reveals the huge holes in their core logic. They are dependent on people who can't or won't apply apply critical thinking to propagate them. Motivated thinking is a hell of a drug. 

Russia is the only agency that can stop the war. Full stop. There is no quick fix that does not involve Russia stopping. Russia is to blame here for every fucking thing.

Not infinite, but they still have a lot and they can and are getting more. Hence the drones and likely missiles from Iran. It can and is building new and refurbishing old tanks. It can and is redesigning weapon system to work from home made and importable parts. Will they be as good, no. That doesn't stop them from using them. A state like Russia has tremendously deep reserves of money and resources that it can keep throwing into this war if it wants to. It can keep building 80s style T-72s and artillery for years. Industrial states are incredibly tough and hard to physically exhaust.

Remember that Russia did poorly during the first years of both WW1 and WW2. It suffered from poor logistics, lack of equipment, and high casualties. The Russian Empire's population during WW1 was 165 million. The Russian Federation's population is 143 million as of 2020. Russia could keep fighting this war for years. 

The question is, will it? In both WWI and WWII Russia was being invaded. Enemy troops were on their land and in the case of WWII, Russia were facing an genocidal enemy that wanted them annihilated. 

That isn't the case today. Despite the government and media's relentless campaign to equate this to WWII with an existential threat from the gay negro super-soldiers of NATO and the Jewish Nazis of Ukraine, russians aren't buying into this war. It's not their war, and they'd prefer it stay that way. Even the Russian government knows that if they were to just give up, nobody is coming to Moscow to get them. They can afford to lose this war. Can Putin afford to lose this war, maybe, maybe not, but the Russian state certainly can. So how long is that state willing to keep this thing going? They could do it for years, sure, but why? 

I too hope they soon decide it isn't worth it anymore. And think several more solid Ukrainian victories would help them make that decision, but they don't have to. Which is why I think the west needs to stop faffing about, treat this like a war that could potentially continue for years, and start training and equipping Ukraine with the thousands of tanks and artillery and hundreds of jets it would need to properly fight said war. If there is never a need for it and peace breaks out before Christmas, great, but it might not. And Ukraine today would be a lot better off if we started training them on Abrams 9 months ago.

>Senior officers from a brigade of the Special Forces warned in an open letter to Lukashenko, who is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, against sending troops to fight in Ukraine, arguing that such a decision is ""pure suicide,"" the Express reported.

Only Newsweek and the Express reported on this ""letter"".  The letter was outed as a fake, after which Newsweek edited their original article and added this line:

>Newsweek has not been able to independently verify the letter

But of course the entire article was based on a fake letter, originally reported on by a tabloid, and Newsweek never corrected that, they just added in a line to cover their asses.  And according to ""Media Bias Fact Check"":

 >The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts unguided bombs, or ""dumb bombs"", into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM-equipped bombs are guided by an integrated inertial guidance system coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, giving them a published range of up to 15 nautical miles (28 km). JDAM-equipped bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds (230 to 910 kg). The JDAM's guidance system was jointly developed by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, hence the ""joint"" in JDAM.

They (NATO leadership) needs to consider under what circumstances Ukraine would accept defeat.  Russia had no chance of defeating Ukraine in spring of 2022.  They may have had the possibility of overrunning Ukraine.  Russian tanks could have reached the Polish borders.  Russia would have eventually lost all of Ukraine for the same reason Russia lost Afghanistan and USA lost Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq.  At no point in two decades did any army in Iraq or Afghanistan take the field and defeat a US brigade. 

The ""certain eventual victory"" has enough cost that it is very understandable that Ukraine does not like that route.  We could have seen Bucha but on a vast scale.  

If we throw a tank division into Ukraine it is a gamble.  It *might* create a breakthrough like Ukraine achieved in September.  However, it also gives Russia something to encircle and destroy.  M1 tanks can run out of gas the same way Russia's T72s ran out of gas.  It certainly is not the most likely outcome.  But it is a *possible* and even *plausible* outcome.  

Even if the decision was made in favor of ""tanks"" there is a question of when they should arrive to have maximum impact.  I am not military trained.  But from historical precedent the shock is most brutal when it arrives and the opponent is over extended.  NATO did send and is sending large numbers of tanks and armored vehicles of Soviet design.

USA is sending M1s to Poland.  From here in Pennsylvania Oblast Poland is almost the entire way to Ukraine.  All aspects of transporting to and supplying M1 tanks in Ukraine require the logistics of sending and supplying M1 tanks to Poland.  Ukraine is just a little bit further.  

If they were going to trickle the US armor in it might as well trickle into the Belarus border area and free up Ukraine's Soviet vehicles from that area.  The armored division can train for the hammer blow right where they are in the north around Kiev.  When it is time to go they get relieved by the new western tanks and relocate East.  Maybe they could even use the same tank transport vehicles to drop the M1 and pick up the T72 (I have never loaded a tank, no CDL, feel free to critique if you know anything, T72s are much lighter than M1).  

The risk for Ukraine using a T72/T80 blitz is much lower even if T72s are much more dangerous for crews.  If the blitz fails the public perception in Ukraine (and Russia) would be that the new NATO tanks still had not been used yet.",False,1669657693.0,t3_z6m6jl,t1_iy3ruq1,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Ukraine **never had the choice** to stay neutral. It had the choice to become a Russian satellite state with endless corruption and always folding to Russian demands, or to take the conflict. Edit: Yanukovich illustrated this nicely. Extremely corrupt. Tried to place his party (party of regions) in a position to control the country via tie-ins to local businesses at all levels. Promised East Ukraine closer ties with Russia and West Ukraine closer ties with the EU. In 2013 he came clean, siding with Russia and turned his back against the EU. Hence the Euromaidan.

There was never an option for Ukraine to become a prosperous, ""neutral"" democracy. That scenario was in some way *worse* for the imperialists in Kremlin - because such a state would defy the narrative that anti-Russian sentiment in Ukraine is simply American brainwashing and become fuel to the opposition back home.

This danger of location via phone was first learned in 2014-2015 in eastern Ukraine, when CIA contract guys figured out why Russian snipers were successful—and the policy started then. The Ukrainian military has had a no phone policy since.  Even the ATO and territorial defense.

I’ve translated many articles over the last 10months—also, they don’t want men to have phones if they were to get captured—it could be used against them (draw out others, psychological torture on family, gather data).  

In Mariupol, when an array of people got surrounded (Ilych, Azovmash, Azovstal)—since there was such a large mix—civilians, medical, police, volunteers, border guards, marines, families—there did end up being people w phones.  They actually downloaded lots of movies and passed them around to everyone to watch, rewatch to lift spirits or distract from injuries.  But couldn’t use otherwise, except at certain times, pre-approved (must’ve jammed R’s ability intercept?), it was like once a month call.

Folks who’ve escaped, like one account of a commander that was ordered to take about a dozen men from Azovstal (or Azovmash, maybe), 100 miles to UA held territory, *on foot*—had to do it with no phones, a paper map.  Seems like he studied maps on iPad while at Mariupol.  Walked only at night.  Well, the commander had a phone, but had to keep it off, then when got to rendezvous point, turned on and called in. (He was awarded medal.)

Recon guys are a different story.

A commander of a recon team, he and several of his guys did have their military phones when got concussed, captured, at beginning of war.  But via Russian incompetence, and apparently Russian friendly fire, escaped when their own captors were concussed.  The Russians seized the recon guys phones, except the commander, Bc they were so distracted with torturing him, forgot to thoroughly check, and/or he kept it in an armsleeve pocket, behind his patch, and they forgot to check.  [Like here, 3rd photo](https://www-rbc-ua.translate.goog/rus/news/vitaliy-klichko-maemo-buti-gotovi-shcho-vidklyuchennya-1669591669.html?_x_tr_sl=uk&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)  Seems like they had to run 10miles—some barefoot, others half-dressed, back to UA-held territory—in March in Chernihiv. He kept it off until back to where had air cover.  

Another story is about a commander, who led territorial defense in Kherson, but when his units ran out of ammunition, he was ordered to have his units bury their weapons and documents, put on civilian clothes, keep phone off and each get selves to Mykolaiv.  The commander stayed behind.  Dressed like a drunk hobo.  Doused himself in liquor. Rubbed trash on himself.  Fake-staggered all over the city, laid in ditches, sometimes for over a day.  So that he could observe enemy locations, hobble off somewhere, phone it in, then stagger off somewhere else.  Apparently, he was responsible for calling in those Chornobaivka reports—he’d lay there, and was astounded they kept going back, so he’d call it in again.  But also, they have not-normal cell phones.  They have military-issued phones with encryption.  But I think he said at some point, his was at a location he couldn’t access, so he started using Snapchat?  (It’s in my history, where I translated and posted.) Bc he’d move around city, stay different places.  He’s in Kharkiv with it seems like 2/3 of that unit now.  [some were killed, some captured, and sadly, some switched sides, he said.] He wants to go back to Kherson, go dig up those weapons, lol.",1669672994.0,1669660517.0,t3_z6m6jl,t1_iy3hnvh,,4,6,0,6,0,0,

Tanks, even advanced battle tanks, can be surrounded, logistically starved and destroyed.  But what about aircraft?  Yes they can be shot down, but the logistics chain is far removed from the front line.  Consider, if you would, a nation with 5th gen fighters flying combat air patrols and/or close air support for Ukrainian military, performing SEAD/DEAD missions ahead of time... the chance of shootdown would be non-zero, sure - but definitely far *less*.  Aircraft seem less prone to this than ground based things (tanks, boots on the ground, etc).

Something like that would turn the tide, yet the logistics could be entirely from Western Ukraine - or even outside Ukraine.

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,z6m6jl,iy5adxy,"I am not Air Force trained.  

We are biased because of the 1991 experience with Arabia.  In the Early '80s the Saudis and gulf states started drilling ""Desert Shield"".  They bought some aircraft but then built air bases and facilities for three times as many planes and support personnel.  When USA/coalition moved in they just slightly expanded what was already there.  

A book I read (written in 90s) contrasted the Soviet Air Force and Air Defense Force with NATO standard operating procedure.  He had a photo of Air Force personnel, including officers, walking the runway arms linked sweeping for foreign objects.  We have immaculate runways.  The engineering is taken from bridge decks but with higher rigidity.  The author then had a photo of a Soviet jet (maybe mig 29) on a decaying concrete runway with grass growing through the cracks and spare rusty equipment laying in the field.  Some Soviet jets had flaps on the air intakes and gill slits on top so that they could avoid sucking in trash.  

The upper panels on some Soviet of jets were still riveted.  The Soviet engineers were expecting damage and abuse.  F16s have a single engine and a big vacuum air sucking scoop.  Soviet jets were steel.  F16s frames are aluminum.  US jets are light weight and nimble like the tights that Russian ice skaters wear.  High speed, low wing loading for high g-force turns, excellent thrust to weight ratio, and beautiful too.  

It is not just Russian concern.  The US Navy refused the F16.  The F18 was claimed to be more rugged and reliable.  We recently saw the same fight with the F35.  A plane capable of landing on a carrier deck has to be able to be handled roughly.  The Navy requirements are offensive to the Air Force because they do not need the stronger frame and the Air Force believes (probably right too) that lighter is better.  An Air Force pilot can eject but Navy pilots who eject are lost in the Pacific and a destroyer has to go find them.    

Building hangars and airstrips probably takes about as long as training pilots.  Ukraine might need to fortify and mine them so they cannot become entry points for Russian airborne.  They need hangars and bunkers and mechanics.  

>...Consider, if you would, a nation with 5th gen fighters flying combat air patrols and/or close air support for Ukrainian military, performing SEAD/DEAD missions ahead of time... the chance of shootdown would be non-zero, sure - but definitely far less...

I am not sure why Reddit users always say F16 rather than F35.  Or even F15. 

A10s can handle the worst airfields.  For hunting down propellor driven drones some older slower planes like a P51 might be excellent.  

I think people might say F16 because of the cost of newer jets.  The US Air Force will not care about cost.  They do care about reputation.  They hate the idea of US jets getting a lower kill ratio anywhere on the globe.  They dont want anyone driving them until they decay and then ejecting either.  It effects their reputation of invincibility.  Ukrainians wanting the sexy jets probably just reinforces the idea that Air Force reputation matters.",False,1669670324.0,t3_z6m6jl,t1_iy4p5iu,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
