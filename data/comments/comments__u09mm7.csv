Day 46 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was not quiet at all today. Even right now explosions are almost constant. Shelling was pretty bad the whole day, and it sounded not that far away too. That might have been because of the Russian convoy that was destroyed today, that was moving in the direction of Derhachi, from the reports Russian casualties are in the hundreds (up to 2000) with a lot of their vehicles destroyed. And just around 2 hours ago we heard something weird, something we didn’t hear before during this war. 

We heard: 1) the sound of artillery firing 2) the sound of the shell flying through the air, it was in the air for around 27 seconds, and was audible the whole time 3) then we heard the explosion itself. The firing position and the target were close enough that the sound of artillery firing and the sound of a shell landing were equally loud. Also there were quite a lot of shots being fired one after another. I did record the sound of it, so I will post it tomorrow most likely. 

What is even weirder is that at the same time there were reports of explosions around downtown, explosions that most likely were caused by those same shells that we heard being fired somewhere close by, so we don’t actually know whose artillery that was, and who was the target. 

Also the amount of people here dropped considerably in the past couple of days, there are barely any apartment windows lit up in the evening. They might have left after those reports of a possible attack on Kharkiv, there are still quite a lot of people in the streets during the day, but from what we can see there are definitely less people than before.

TL;DR:

1. Because Ukraine has Kharkiv, column forced to follow single-file on a secondary, narrow road from Belgorod to Izyum; slower, longer road leaving plenty of time for breakdowns or UKR attacks.

2. Second video of Russian troops staging in Donetsk also shows TWO civilian Ladas with painted Zs as their logistics vehicles. ISW assessment about Russia taking months to build up a large, combat-capable force of mechanized units quite probable.

3. Conclusion:

> * Long-story short. Those talking a few days ago about the Russians building up a large army and seizing the Donbas have to realize this is very unlikely in the short term (and long-term as well). We are just as likely the disorganized Russian preparations that occurred around Kyiv.

> * The Ukrainians have excellent intelligence, the Russians have major logistical problems and will struggle to build up forces.

In addition to looting computers and equipment, the Russian troops “unauthorizedly entered a repository of ionizing radiation sources” and “stole and damaged 133 sources with a total activity of about 7 million becquerels,” the nuclear company said, noting that “this is comparable to 700 kg of radioactive waste with the presence of beta and gamma radiation.” Citing the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management, the company said it was believed the Russian soldiers took the “deadly” items “as souvenirs.” But if they were hoping to bring these souvenirs back home to impress their friends, they’re in for a surprise, as “carrying such a souvenir with you for two weeks will inevitably lead to radiation burns, radiation sickness and irreversible processes in the body,” according to Energoatom.",False,1649582500.0,t3_u09mm7,t3_u09mm7,,0,98,0,98,0,0,

>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-05-23-mn-2269-story.html

>The Soviet army in Afghanistan suffered from widespread drug abuse, internal conflict and desertions by soldiers fed up with primitive health care and hygiene, a RAND Corp. study released today said.

>The report, based on interviews with 35 Soviet war veterans as well as talks with Afghan resistance leaders and an extensive survey of Soviet military literature, was prepared by the Santa Monica-based think tank’s Army-sponsored Arroyo Center.

>The report, “Inside the Soviet Army in Afghanistan,” is billed as the first systematic examination of Soviet armed forces in post-World War II combat incorporating substantial firsthand information.

>Author Alexander Alexiev and his RAND colleagues interviewed Soviet defectors and prisoners of war from a variety of military specialties, ranks and ethnic backgrounds who served in Afghanistan at various times between 1980 and 1987.

>The study found:

>--**Drug use was so widespread, with more than 50% of Soviet personnel said to be regular users**, that it will likely have a negative effect on Soviet society long after the troop withdrawal is completed.

>--Disease, often caused by extremely poor hygiene, may have claimed more casualties than the bullets of the U.S.-supported moujahedeen Muslim resistance fighters, while inadequate living conditions and isolation also sapped health and morale.

>**Slayings, Desertions Common**

>--Fragging (murder between servicemen) and desertions appeared “fairly common (with) scattered evidence of open and even organized insubordination.” **The victims of the fragging were typically other servicemen rather than officers**.

>--Soviet **officers instigated reprisals and brutality against the civilian population in violation of international conventions even as they punished troops engaged in “free-lance” looting and atrocities**.

>--Ethnic conflicts in the ranks, particularly between Soviet Muslims and the Slavic majority, were a continuing problem.

>The study also found that the estimated 115,000 troops were psychologically ill-prepared for service in Afghanistan.

>Before being shipped to Afghanistan, **troops were often told that they had been invited by the Afghan people and would be fighting foreign mercenaries. Once there, they were instructed to regard every Afghan, including women and children, as a potential enemy.**

>The study said desertion totals were unavailable, but more than 100 Soviet servicemen are known to have successfully defected to the moujahedeen.

“We are coming to an end of another week,"" Zelensky said in his speech, which he has given regularly during Russia’s attack on the country. ""Our fight for freedom, for the state. Another week that Ukraine stayed alive, despite all the efforts of Russia to destroy us. We are fighting. We are defending. We are repelling the attacks.""

Zelensky said the nation is doing all it can to win the war and accused Russian leadership of ""lying"" in efforts to shift the blame away from them.

“When cowardice grows, everything turns into catastrophe,"" he continued. ""When people don’t have the courage to recognize their mistakes and apologize, to conform to reality, and to see that they are turning into monsters.""

The Ukrainian president said Russia has lost touch with reality, acting as aggressors yet blaming Ukraine for the actions committed by Russian troops, including the killings in Bucha, the missile strike on the train station in Kramatorsk, and ""every destroyed city and burnt village."" 

“They have destroyed the lives of millions. They started a full-scale war and act as if we are to blame for this,” Zelensky continued. 

He added Russia, fearing defeat, will launch more full-scale combat actions in Ukraine’s east. 

“But we are ready,” the president said, promising Ukraine will ensure it has enough weapons and demand stronger sanctions against Russia so that justice will be served.

Moments prior to his address, Zelensky said he honored ""18 defenders of Ukraine"" -- including members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Special Communications Service and police officers -- for their heroism. He also thanked the journalists sharing the truth of what is unfolding in the country.

Ukraine, Russia gear up for war’s biggest battles. 

Ukraine and Russia poured reinforcements into eastern Ukraine this weekend, preparing for what is likely to become the war’s biggest battles as refugees continued to flee the looming Russian assault.

Russia’s main objective now is to seize the parts of the eastern Donbas region not yet controlled by Moscow. Unlike the first phase of the six-week-old conflict, that shift is forcing Ukraine into fighting conventional battles involving tanks, artillery and aircraft on flat, often barren terrain that allows Russia to leverage its superiority in military equipment.

Fresh Russian tank and artillery units, as well as forces withdrawn from areas around Kyiv, began arriving in recent days to staging grounds for the offensive north of the Ukrainian city of Izyum, according to footage shown on Russian military television. Ukraine, too, started moving toward Donbas combat units from areas of northern Ukraine that it recovered after Russian troops retreated.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for urgent assistance ahead of this new round of the conflict, warning that Moscow hasn’t given up on its aspirations to subjugate Ukraine. “Russia can still afford to live in illusions, gathering new armor and new troops on our soil. And that means that we need even more sanctions, and even more weapons for our state,"" he said in a late Saturday video address.

Authorities over the weekend urged all civilians in Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions—which comprise Donbas—and two districts of the Kharkiv region to use all available means to leave immediately. They organized additional trains and buses.

Many Russian battalion tactical groups that withdrew from northern Ukraine were battered so badly that they won’t be able to redeploy to the Donbas front anytime soon, Ukrainian and Western officials said. “We’ve seen indications on some units that are, literally, for all intents and purposes, eradicated,"" a senior Pentagon official said. Russia, he said, is trying to mobilize some 60,000 reservists to fill the gap in manpower.

The tactical situation is more advantageous for Russia on the Donbas front. Russian supply lines are shorter, and the more concentrated area of operations allows Russia to more effectively use air support, Ukrainian and Western military officials said.

This different type of warfare, with large formations facing each other instead of small-unit strikes, is a major reason why Kyiv says it urgently needs heavy weapons, such as artillery, tanks and antiaircraft batteries that most Western allies have been reluctant to supply so far.

“The battle for Donbas will remind you of the Second World War, with its large operations and maneuvers, the involvement of thousands of tanks, armored vehicles, planes and artillery. And this will not be a local operation, based on what we see in Russia’s preparations,"" Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after meeting North Atlantic Treaty Organization ministers this past week. “Either you help us now—and I’m speaking days, not weeks—or your help will come too late and many people will die.""",False,1649645053.0,t3_u09mm7,t3_u09mm7,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

@belzhd_live  


The State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus have thrown all their available forces and resources to capture at least one group of ""railroad guerrillas"". At stake were, and perhaps still are, the positions and shoulder straps of individual high-ranking ""personalities"" in the government.

At the moment, the regime does not trust anyone: neither the employees of the OVDT, nor the paramilitary guards (VOKhR) of the Belarusian Railway. Access to information relating to the investigation of sabotage on the railway, has a very limited circle of people. 

Information on the passage of military echelons to employees who are associated with the movement of trains, whether it is a station duty officer (DSP) or a train dispatcher (DNTs), is brought 10-15 minutes before the passage. The illegitimate government is paranoid - the regime sees a saboteur in every employee of the BelZhD. It comes to the point that those who work with the organization of the HSE movement are constantly being monitored by the KGB.

Bobruisk and Osipovichi districts were literally taken under round-the-clock monitoring. Some of the measures used to capture the ""railroad guerrillas"" were unprecedented:

- full monitoring and analytics of network traffic in these areas (as an example: analysis of search queries);

- operational work was carried out in relation to those who already fell into the field of view of the ""siloviki"" due to protest activity;

- processing video images of all available surveillance cameras in order to find even the slightest ""hook"";

- installation of camera traps in some places and areas;

- at night, in the forests and on rural roads bordering the railway tracks (hidden and open), employees of law enforcement agencies were on duty;

- from the air, the territory along the railway and the areas bordering it was patrolled by UAVs and thermal imaging was carried out.

These measures are still being used on the railway section from Minsk to Baranovichi, and especially in the Stolbtsovsky and Derzhinsky districts (Minsk region).

From CNN Staff

Yurii Sobolevskyi, deputy head of the Kherson Regional Council, said locals held a ""peaceful rally"" Sunday in the Russian-occupied city of Kherson that was dispersed by Russian forces. 

""Today in Kherson a peaceful rally took place in front of the Yubileiny concert hall to commemorate the victims of Russian aggression,"" he said on Facebook. ""As expected, the occupiers dispersed it.""

He added that locals were participating in rallies at ""great risk,"" saying locals faced intimidation and the threat of disappearance. 

CNN was not immediately able to verify the rally or its turnout. Ukrainians opposed to Russian occupation have held a series of rallies in cities in southern Ukraine. 

The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Sunday said Russians in the town of Nova Kakhovka in Kherson region had used local printing houses to prepare brochures, booklets and posters in preparation for an apparent referendum on the establishment of a so-called ""Kherson People's Republic."" 

Separatists in eastern Ukraine held referendums in 2014 on the formation of ""people's republics,"" in voting that was dismissed by Ukraine and Western countries as a sham.

Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson regional council, said Russian sympathizers holding Russian tricolor flags had tried to organize a rally in the city of Nova Kakhovka, posting a photo on Facebook that he said showed a very small turnout compared with a pro-Ukrainian rally.  

""This is all you need to know about the probability of a Kherson People's Republic in the Kherson region,"" he said. ""This will not happen, because this is Ukraine!""",False,1649598485.0,t3_u09mm7,t3_u09mm7,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

From CNN’s Scott McLean and Amy Cassidy 

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has thanked the “iron people” of Ukraine’s railway workforce, in a video which emerged Sunday of him riding a train out to Kyiv from Poland.

The video emerged two days after a devastating missile strike at Kramatorsk railway station killed 52 civilians and injured dozens, sparking an international outcry. 

“I’m traveling on a fantastic Ukrainian Railways train through to Kyiv from Poland,” Johnson said in the video obtained by CNN from state-run Ukrainian Railways. The UK prime minister paid a previously unannounced visit to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Saturday. 

Johnson acknowledged the nickname given to the railway men and women of Ukraine, the “iron people,” which “reflects the spirit that you're showing the spirit of Ukraine in standing up to the appalling aggression that we’re seeing,” he said in the video. 

“I'm so sorry about the loss of some of your colleagues and comrades at Kramatorsk. And we in the UK stand in sympathy and in solidarity with you,” he continued. 

In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Ukrainian Railways said it had evacuated 3.5 million people since Russia’s invasion began, primarily children, women and groups of people with disabilities.

“And that’s what we’re expecting,” Psaki said to Dana Perino in an interview on Fox News Sunday. 

CNN reported on Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed a new general to direct the war in Ukraine as his military shifts plans after a failure to take Kyiv, according to a US official and a European official.

The officials told CNN that Army General Alexander Dvornikov, the commander of Russia’s Southern Military District, has been named as theater commander of Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, following a series of battlefield setbacks and an apparent lack of coordination among groups of Russian forces operating in Ukraine.   

Psaki called Dvornikov responsible for the “atrocities we saw in Syria and said that for Ukraine, the US continues with officials to work to make sure they have the weaponry and assistance they need to be successful on the battlefield.

“Just this week, our national security adviser, our secretary and our chairman of the Joint Chiefs had a two-hour call with their counterparts to go through item by item exactly what the Ukrainians were requesting, what they wanted, if we can't meet what they need. We're working with our allies and partners as we did with the S-300,” Psaki said, referencing that Slovakia transferred to Ukraine this week and the US intends to place an American Patriot missile system in Slovakia in return. 

Psaki also said the administration found the admission from the Kremlin that their forces had suffered great losses, “interesting,” for a country that is slow to admit defeat. 

“It was significant,” she said, calling it a reflection of “the courage of the Ukrainian leaders.”",False,1649619898.0,t3_u09mm7,t3_u09mm7,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

> RIA Novosti is pushing the conspiracy that Boris Johnson visited Kyiv to plan ""provocations"" in Odesa and Kharkiv

RIA Novosti is one of the mainstream state outlets in Russia, for the record. So yes, they are pushing this propaganda angle. And likely telegraphing a false flag attack with which to blame on the West eventually. The government of Kursk also placed the southern region on high terrorist alert on midnight of April 11.   

At this point we’ve seen that even irrefutable proof via satellite imagery of Russian massacres in settlements like Bucha literally does nothing to sway anyone who wasn’t already swayed over to “Russia bad”, so it won’t matter if we can prove we had nothing to do with said attack.

Conspiracy theories are abound, but it doesn’t necessarily matter if it really was to contain the spiraling coronavirus crisis or if they’re only using it as an excuse in an attempt to do something else. All that matters is that China is on fire and Xi has demonstrated he is willing to drop barrels of gasoline on the fire, instead of trying to do the conventionally sane thing and extinguishing it, with the purported claim of protecting China’s self-interests. 

What does that have to do with the Russian invasion, you say? Well, the predominant narrative in Western circles is that China is smart and not willing to self-sabotage their own economy, to help Russia bypass sanctions through backchannel means or providing arms to Russia for their war. **But what’s the predominant narrative over in China?** That the US is attempting to destabilize all of Europe by funding the terrorist government in Ukraine that Russia is valiantly fighting against, and that if things don’t change soon, they’ll become emboldened enough to meddle in Chinese affairs in the Indo-Pacific region as well.

622f0fc60753364612f0101674745e2f,u09mm7,i4721xg,"From the BBC, Ukraine: Three ways this war could escalate and drag Nato in


There are a number of potential scenarios which will doubtless be occupying minds in Western defence ministries.

Here are just three of them:

1. A Nato-supplied anti-ship missile fired by Ukrainian forces in Odesa hits and sinks a Russian warship offshore in the Black Sea with the loss of nearly 100 sailors and dozens of marines. A death toll of this magnitude in a single strike would be unprecedented and Putin would be under pressure to respond in some form.

2. A Russian strategic missile strike targets a supply convoy of military hardware crossing from a Nato country, like Poland or Slovakia, into Ukraine. If casualties were sustained on Nato's side of the border that could potentially trigger Article 5 of Nato's constitution, bringing the entire alliance to the defence of the country attacked.

3. Amidst fierce fighting in the Donbas an explosion occurs at an industrial facility resulting in the release of toxic chemical gases. While this has already occurred, there were no deaths reported. But were it to result in the sort of mass casualties seen in Syria's use of poison gas at Ghouta and if it were found to have been deliberately caused by Russian forces, then Nato would be obliged to respond.

It is perfectly possible that none of these scenarios will materialise.

But while Western nations have displayed a rare degree of unity in the strength of their reaction to Russia's invasion, there are suggestions that they are being merely reactive and not thinking through what the endgame should be.

""The bigger strategic question,"" says one of Britain's most experienced military officers who asks not to be named, ""is whether our government is engaged in crisis management or actual strategy."" That would require thinking this through to the finish, he adds.

""What we are trying to achieve here is to give Ukraine every bit of help we can, short of World War Three. The problem is, Putin is a better poker player than we are.""

Tobias Ellwood MP agrees.

""Russia does this [the threat of escalation] very effectively. And we are spooked. We have lost the ability to control the escalatory ladder.""

We do not get to be paralysed with fear because we need to act now before this paralysing fear could become reality for the rest of the continent.

Its a common sentiment of isolationists. Some countries base their entire foreign policy of not caring about anything outside their borders.

Nothing will change an isolationist's mind until it directly effects the country by posing a threat, because in game theory there is no reason to care until that point.

If Russia wins in Ukraine, they are still too weak for NATO or US to pose a threat.

If Russia loses, the US is only marginally more powerful over an already weakened enemy.

It’s not like Russia has ramped up the “we’re the best in the world” hype in the last years, it’s always been like this. Most of nationalist Russians believe that Russia is the best country in terms of literature, science, maths, physics, arts, etc. and that the Soviet Union had its faults, but was ultimately a very good thing. 

Pro-Russia Russians believe that russia is a great land with large history and that the countries surrounding it have all been Russian, were Russia brought culture and civilisation. No joke - Russians claim that *they* brought literacy to us (which is kind of wrong, because it started during Swedish time period, so while the school network may have enlargened during czarist period in 19th century, it was the swedes that started general education IIRC) and that post-WWII they built factories and towns/cities. The latter is true only because they bombed everything to bits where they could. The place I was born looked absolutely beautiful pre-WWII and compared to now (post-WWII), the current version looks quite ugly if you remembered the “before”. 

But that’s how their national standing is. *They* brought culture, *they* built stuff, *they* invented stuff. No recognition that they also destroyed stuff so that they could build stuff or that plenty of the scientists and discoverers were actually ethnical minorities/or actually German/Prussian nobility. 

And they’re European because Russian history says so. Remember Peter the Great and his window to Europe (St Petersburg). Russia was pretty Asian in terms of society and the czar’s court and court dress until Peter the Great. He established a different kind of Russia, much more European looking Russia, with European court dress and European style buildings in St Petersburg. Russian history is big on teaching their people that they are core-Europeans in a unique way. What we consider ‘European’ in terms of liberal values and morals and human rights is not something they see as European - that just gay-paradise-fantasy in their minds.

Also, for many Russian minorities who live in Germany - plenty of them went there in the 90s when Germany allowed those with ethnic German background to return to Germany. It would make sense that these people left Russia behind during the bad era (90s), after a fairly negative decade filled with lack of goods and constantly dying chairmen of the communist party (80s), and Germany back then must’ve been a heaven on earth (plus it would’ve been very very difficult to emigrate legally). They left behind the economically bad Russia, but kept the emotional love for Russia. Since then, in their mind, Russia has restored its historical greatness and they can be ‘proud’ over their home country, even though they’ve lived away for decades and probably won’t return to live there permanently. 

I’d say that it’s somewhat similar to Turkish minority in Germany, but I’m not fully sure the comparison would be apt. Either way, I haven’t met any other group of people who are so patriotic over their birth country, whilst also planning to never return to live there again.",False,1649612525.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i46olpf,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Then one of the family members of the crew was sedated when she questioned the work of the authorities, on live TV, as she was grabbed, held and then some woman injected something into her neck to sedate her so she’d stop speaking the truth to the faces of the committee (which was that nobody gave a F about those crewmen from the military or from the government).

Chornobyl was a massive F up by the local NPP people, so naturally they hushed it up in the beginning. Despite Pripyat being just some 3km away I think, the families of the NPP employees and the firemen were not evacuated, we’re not told to close windows and were not told not allow their kids outside. In fact, USSR government first publicly recognised that there had been something (which they said was a small technical problem, which had been solved by that time) when reports started to come in from Europe - Sweden specifically IIRC -that they had readings of high nuclear matter in air yet none of the plants in Europe had issues, hence speculation about a nuclear disaster in USSR started to circle around. 

This is a country that has an inability to admit when they make a mistake and then inability to accept that a mistake was made and fix said mistake. Rather, they prefer to lie and hide the truth.

When the TV series ‘Chernobyl’ was made, it received pretty high praise (it has its faults, but you cannot deny that the accuracy in portraying USSR lifestyle at the time was pretty darn high - the flats and furnishings and offices looked exactly as they were here if you look at the pictures from that time), except Russia declared that it was a travesty and promised to make their own depiction, in which the Chornobyl disaster didn’t happen because of a disastrous leading,  but because the Americans sabotaged it. 

That’s the level of Russian state being able to admit that it F up some nearly 40 years ago. 

My bet would be that they just don’t say anything at all. Saying something would indicate that it wasn’t a small thing (because why the F would you talk about some random NPP in Ukraine) and they’d never say that there was a big thing, so nothing gets said at all, I suspect.",False,1649613845.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i465pjn,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Rob Lee gave his thoughts on the article on twitter:

A good article by Yaroslav. Narrowing its focus on the Donbas with fewer large cities will play into the Russian military's strengths, but Ukraine can also afford to retreat to hold more defensible areas. The main objective for Ukraine is to not allow its forces to be encircled.

Ukraine doesn't have to let Russia dictate the direction of the fight. It can attack Russian forces in Kherson, northern Kharkiv, and even conduct attacks along the northeastern Ukrainian border with Russia to stretch Russian forces. 2/

I think Russia will likely achieve some tactical, possibly operational, successes and extend its control over the Donbas, but as long as Ukraine doesn't allow Russia to cut off a substantial share of its forces, I doubt Russia can achieve significant strategic gains. 3/

I also suspect Ukraine has held back much of its TB2 and aviation for this scenario, and it can obviously reinforce positions more quickly from Kyiv and other regions. The question is whether Russia extending control over more of SE Ukraine is sufficient for Moscow's war aims. 4/

Of course, Russia runs the risk of attriting even more of its ground forces to achieve questionable strategic goals, and these forces can't be easily replaced by conscripts. There is also no guarantee that Russia will be able to attain a workable long-term solution in SE Ukraine.",False,1649645284.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i48v4pj,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Immigration is just one part of the story. But Macron is also planning to increase retirement age from 62 to 65, something a lot of French do not like. From my viewpoint as a Dutchie it seem a bit silly, here our retirement age is already approaching 67. Makes the French seem a little like crybabies, but I am not here to judge. Each country is different I suppose and have different problems and a different balance all together. In any case I assume the reason for wanting to raise retirement age is because the French state is not able to deal with the immense costs of its welfare.

Never does. Because the effect of 200-3000 people is significantly outweighed by the actions of several-several tens of millions.

Thats like back when DC started its big push to make the city as biker friendly as possible (for those americans) 

It didn't work, they butchered the streets, a bunch of public programs, and even installed thousands of paid shitcan bikes for people to use across the city. (Legit these bikes are just like $10 of aluminum and a seat because they *knew* they were gonna be a target for theft) 

All of those programs failed spectacularly because theres only maybe a few hundred people willing to go hard on the environmental shit compared to the tens to hundreds of thousands who don't give a shit.

Right now the plan for weaning off russian gas (that i've really seen) is to make a bunch of public statements, and pray it appeases the average citizen long enough for them to quietly find a way to get russian gas coming back into the country. Because no matter what way you spin it Europe isn't looking forward to getting fucked by the saudi's/OPEC for fuel. And the US/Canada seems to be all willing to be europes resource bitch for a while, but i doubt they can do it forever. 

All europe is doing for now in regards to gas and alternatives is basically trying to prolong the inevitable energy riots that will come from russia turning off the tap.

So, they end up suffering, but would never oppose their Leader, because the leader stands up against ""enemies"", and even if it means they live in poverty, at least Russia won't lose it's greatness.

She was very devout and emotional; she believed in fortunetelling, charms, dreams and omens of every conceivable kind; she believed in the prophecies of crazy people, in house spirits, in wood spirits, in unlucky meetings, in the evil eye, in popular remedies; she ate specially prepared salt on Holy Thursday and believed that the end of the world was close at hand; she believed that if on Easter Sunday the candles did not go out at Vespers, then there would be a good crop of buckwheat, and that a mushroom will not grow after a human eye has seen it; she believed that the devil likes to be where there is water, and that every Jew has a blood-stained spot on his breast; she was afraid of mice, of snakes, of frogs, of sparrows, of leeches, of thunder, of cold water, of draughts, of horses, of goats, of red-haired people and of black cats; she regarded crickets and dogs as unclean animals; she never ate veal, pigeons, crayfish, cheese, asparagus, Jerusalem artichokes, hares, or watermelons because a cut watermelon suggested the head of John the Baptist; she could not speak of oysters without a shudder; she enjoyed eating--but strictly observed fasts; she slept ten hours out of the twenty-four--and never went to bed at all if Vassily Ivanovich had so much as a headache; she had never read a single book except Alexis or the Cottage in the Forest; she wrote one or at most two letters in a year, but she was an expert housewife, knew all about preserving and jam making, though she touched nothing with her own hands and was usually reluctant to move from her place. Arina Vlasyevna was very kindhearted and in her own way far from stupid. She knew that the world is divided into masters whose duty it is to command, and simple people whose duty it is to serve--and so she felt no disgust for servile behavior or bowing to the ground; but she treated affectionately and gently those in subjection to her, never let a single beggar go away empty-handed, and never spoke ill of anyone, though she was fond of gossip. In her youth she had been very pretty, had played the clavichord and spoken a little French; but in the course of many years of wandering with her husband, whom she had married against her will, she had grown stout and forgotten both music and French. Her son she loved and feared unutterably; she had handed over the management of her little estate to Vassily Ivanovich--and she no longer took any part in it; she would groan, wave her handkerchief and raise her eyebrows higher and higher in horror directly her old husband began to discuss impending land reforms and his own plans. She was apprehensive, always expecting some great calamity, and would weep at once whenever she remembered anything sad . . . Nowadays such women have almost ceased to exist.

Russians are supposedly trying to redeploy those units to the eastern front, but most analysts are doubtful that those units are in any shape to be operationally useful.

Russians are still shelling Kharkiv, but haven't made any advance. Farther south on the eastern front, Russians captured the town of Izyum south of Kharkiv and tried to break out to encircle the Ukrainian eastern defensive line, but that advance seems to have stalled out after a few days due to exhaustion/heavy losses.

Most of the rest of the eastern front is basically a stalemate, with the Russian units taking significant losses and not really gaining much ground.

Russians are still besieging Mariupol, and are making (very) gradual progress, but are paying in blood for every inch, and the Ukrainian defenders are still holding out. Russians had hoped to take Mariupol quickly and move the forces there north to attack the Ukrainian eastern defensive line, but the units are probably in rough condition after a month of street-to-street fighting.

Russians still hold Kherson in the south, but they've been pushed back from any realistic chance of threatening Mykolaiv/Odessa, and the Ukrainians are (slowly) pushing back Russian forces back towards Kherson.

“Ukraine and Russia poured reinforcements into eastern Ukraine this weekend, preparing for what is likely to become the war’s biggest battles as refugees continued to flee the looming Russian assault.

Russia’s main objective now is to seize the parts of the eastern Donbas region not yet controlled by Moscow. Unlike the first phase of the six-week-old conflict, that shift is forcing Ukraine into fighting conventional battles involving tanks, artillery and aircraft on flat, often barren terrain that allows Russia to leverage its superiority in military equipment.”

The obvious ones off the top of my head:

- paediatric defibrillator pads (physically smaller, sometimes also enforce an energy limitation depending on the device to prevent excessively large shocks)
- paediatric bag-valve-mask setups (to avoid inadvertent overinflation during ventilation, which can kill an otherwise viable patient)
- paediatric airways (probably oropharyngeal, but maybe advanced airways as well)
- paediatric intravenous or intraosseus kits

And so on. Almost anything done by a medical provider needs to be specifically sized for the child to be done properly.

A “CPR kit” is just shorthand, really. To attend a cardiac arrest in my workplace, I’d take every kit in the vehicle and dump them strategically around the patient. For a child, that’d be seven kits (which is dumb, but they’re being whittled down soon); for an adult, it’d be six.

One of the reasons Afghanistan was so damn hard to invade for the USA, was that the USA had to build bridges all over the damn place to just get places. There were so many hills, valleys, cliffs... it is said that the US Army's #1 weapon in Afghanistan was concrete.

-----

If you want troops at location X, you need to bring food and other supplies to X. Flying supplies in requires an airport (already requiring a bare minimum amount of concrete / asphalt to sustainably land, unload, load, and takeoff airplanes).

A cheaper option is to build a physical bridge to X, and just truck your supplies in. Army engineering is extremely important.

It is said that the US Army is basically a glorified FedEx / UPS operation, where they are working on delivering bullets to the enemy. Bridges, railroads, airplanes, etc. etc. These all require significant investments in concrete. After all, a truck is cheaper than an airplane, but those trucks require bridges.

Acoustic Kitty is a CIA project launched by the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology, which in the 1960s intended to use cats to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies. In an hour-long procedure a veterinary surgeon implanted a microphone in the cat's ear canal, a small radio transmitter at the base of its skull and a thin wire into its fur.\[1\]  
  
This would allow the cat to innocuously record and transmit sound from its surroundings. Due to problems with distraction, the cat's sense of hunger had to be addressed in another operation.\[2\] Victor Marchetti, a former CIA officer, said Project Acoustic Kitty cost about $20 million.\[3\]  
  
The first Acoustic Kitty mission was to eavesdrop on two men in a park outside the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C. The cat was released nearby, but was hit and allegedly killed by a taxi almost immediately.\[4\] However, this was disputed in 2013 by Robert Wallace, a former Director of the CIA's Office of Technical Service, who said that the project was abandoned due to the difficulty of training the cat to behave as required, and ""the equipment was taken out of the cat; the cat was re-sewn for a second time, and lived a long and happy life afterwards"".\[5\] Subsequent tests also failed.\[2\] Shortly thereafter the project was considered a failure and declared to be a total loss.\[6\] However, other accounts report more success for the project.\[7\]  
  
The project was cancelled in 1967.\[2\] A closing memorandum said that the CIA researchers believed that they could train cats to move short distances, but that ""the environmental and security factors in using this technique in a real foreign situation force us to conclude that for our (intelligence) purposes, it would not be practical.""\[8\] The project was disclosed in 2001, when some CIA documents were declassified.\[9\]",False,1649572462.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i44ul8d,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

They never left NATO.

They left the command structure. But France was still a part of NATO. They just refused to be apart of the command structure.

Basically they didn't want there troops being ordered by any other country(Cough the US) nor did they want any foreign troops stationed on french soil. They also didn't want any nuclear weapons(other than there own) on french soil.

Things like drones, short and long range guided missiles and laser guided artillery mean that both sides have access to firepower that can easily obliterate a tank or a platoon or a helicopter if they fix its position. Massed tanks charging into javelin and nlaw ambushes don't do much better than WW1 massed infantry charging into barbed wire and machine guns, and close air support needs to be extremely precise to avoid getting smoked by stingers. And infantry are in huge trouble if they don't know how to avoid drawing the attention of drones, conceal themselves from air or artillery

The result of that is combined arms tactics and experienced, technically adept soldiers are absolutely critical. Against well armed, technologically advanced opponents, weight of numbers simply doesn't cut it anymore, the gap in capability between a conscript with a rifle and experienced infantry who know how to use handheld AT and AA systems, conduct recon with drones, use NVGs effectively, fix positions of enemy heavy weapons and call in fire support, avoid compromising their coms or becoming an easy target for artillery or a missile, etc etc, is huge.

Point is, highly trained soldiers are like gold.

Without strong reference points, viewed everything as normal, and for a time, it kind of was. Considers Medvedev to have been a relatively decent reformer by comparison to Putin, and pegs the beginning of their downturn naturally ~2012.

Sees many things differently in retrospect. Recalls a much lower level of anti-western sentiment as a kid - not taught to hate anyone, but see that this is now being done. Compares the behaviors of the different generations in reaction to the propaganda - particularly older folks who had experienced it under Soviet rule (the newer propaganda basically corroborating decades-old propaganda. Was into the Navalny opposition movement. 

**""... literally every single year I'm just like okay, come on, it cannot get any worse than this, but it fucking does..""**

Internet wasn't really regulated in a big way until the mid-2010s. Talks about his latent tendency to self-censor on controversial topics, highlighting the effectiveness of their indoctrination. Feels he is still somehow scared to speak his mind.

Considers people his age ~20 to have grown up in a different Russia, and now get to experience a generational trauma, not unlike traumas imposed upon generations under Soviet rule.

Highlights signs of hope for international unity out as far as 2018 (using FIFA event as an example). Sees these hopes of openness to have vanished at this point.

Notes that the people who buy into the propaganda/rhetoric just don't understand the tragedy of it all. 

Admits a pessimistic outlook, but doesn't seem to have given up.

Energy storage is only relevant if noon in June has 100% of grid energy coming from solar.  It is also not like having too much electricity mid day harms anyone.  Excess can be drained to ground without any adverse effects.  

Energy storage is valuable for a complete energy system.  When the surpluses emerge solutions will appear quickly.  A multitude of industries will shift to using power while it is cheaper.  Aluminum and silicon industries have a particularly easy time making this transition.  Aluminum plants frequently forces their employees to work night shift in summertime to avoid higher cost of electricity because of AC.  Silicon can be even more flexible because a major part of the energy demand is hydrogen gas.  Electrolysis hardware is extremely cheap and easy to scale up.  Aluminum and silicon are what we use to make PV solar panels.  Since we are transitioning they become a much large fraction of our industry.  

Pumped hydro is fully ""good enough"".  Existing systems get 70 to 80% of energy return on a full cycle.  Some hydro-electric plants can be effective storage without any added hardware.  Just don't use them during daylight.  Places with excess water (great lakes) just need to add generators so that they can increase output at night.  No need for new dams.

There are also 4 autonomous okrugs and one autonomous oblast. Since gaining power Putin has restricted the powers of these parts effectively rendering them nominally autonomous.

Sanctions will also affect Moscow's ability to maintain control over the Federation's various parts. Since Putin gaining power in 2000 we see Russia using its ""hybrid war"" policy trying to reassert its power over previous Soviet Union republics. Their excursion into Ukraine has shown the world (including its constituent parts) how incompetent their military is in reality. Just as the sanctions and economic effects of the sanctions imposed on the previous Soviet Union saw it fall apart in 1991 there is every reason to expect a similar future for the Russian Federation. This is why Ukraine must prevail and regain its lost territory and Russia's military must be degraded as much as possible.

There was no such thought at the start of the invasion. The closest eventuality to that that we can see right now is if the invasion goes so bad that it leaves Putin feeling  vulnerable, and he decides that chances are favorable enough of the west being unwilling to retaliate by nuking Russia for his nuking of Ukraine. So he can unilaterally use nukes as a final way to cow resistance, the same way the invasion was supposed to. Not necessarily feeling vulnerable specifically to invasion by NATO, but just in general, because there are a lot of things that he could see as threats to his medium-term viability. And a decimated Russian economy and global standing doesn't seem to be one of them, since he's done a pretty good job of convincing enough Russians that it was worth it/not his fault.

It's important to remember that at this point it doesn't matter to Putin what the west thinks of him. He's already about as low as he can go, since the worst we can do with sanctions isn't qualitatively much worse for HIM than where he's at now. It's only about what effect his decisions will have in Russia. He may well decide that a hot war with NATO is necessary, since he has used wars in the past to unite Russians in support, and a fight against evil NATO could be better for that than against brotherly Ukraine.

He's just trying to keep control and support of the Russians, so whatever he does, he just has to be able to lie about it well enough that his repression of opposition can handle the reaction. It seems pretty unclear right now whether him risking the retaliatory nuking of Russian citizens by using nukes first would risk putting them over the edge.

What I was talking about above however in the AFRF is the confusion of the political narrative and reality. An example ""we will be greeted with flowers as liberators"".

We were very well aware that Iraq did not have WMDs, that’s why evidence was fabricated.

There have been no shortage of failures the last 20 years, but intelligence is not one of them. Shit, we even knew al Qaeda was planning to fly planes into our buildings, we just didn’t do anything to stop it.

This is illogical. The notion that France didn’t believe Russia would invade because Ukraine would do well makes absolutely zero sense. The second part is predicated upon the first part not happening, so it’s completely contradictory.

 >The lead ship – Baden-Württemberg – was initially delivered with several problems. These included a persistent 1. 3° list to starboard and the fact that the ship was dramatically overweight which would limit its performance, increase its cost of operation, and most importantly, adversely affect the German Navy's ability to add future upgrades to the somewhat sparsely outfitted vessel. Furthermore, there were also problems with the frigate's operations room from where the highly automated ship will be controlled.

Fact is that there will be soldiers eagerly participating in the brutality, there will be soldiers being pressured or ordered into participating, and some who are not participating at all. It will vary depending on the circumstance, the regiment they are part of, the situation on the ground and their commanding officers. 

And I do feel bad for them because they were ordered into Ukraine. Because they are by and large young men with little education and no proper guidance, who are lied to, put into extreme circumstances and lack the intellectual tools to properly deal with that. They are told to dominate, that the Ukrainians are subhumans and they are frustrated because their comrades are dying, they are scared and underfed, and they are acting out in the worst way possible.

But just as I feel sorry for a mistreated dog that bites people, I can also feel sorry for a Russian soldier that has been twisted so bad they end up raping and killing. Life often isn't one thing or the other. I can be angry and disgusted at their behaviour, and feel sorry for them at the same time. Doesn't mean they should walk free, it just means they too are victims in a way, and if we want to keep our own humanity - it's good to remember that.",False,1649596128.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i45pgfq,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

It's sort of like the Ukrainian strike on that fuel depot in Russia. Even if the option was open for weeks, you don't tell anyone that until you use it.

Using it at the right time amplifies it's effect. Part of the weapon's effect is reach or precision that they don't know you have.

Ukraine also has the benefit of internal supply lines for redeployment, and of militia/reservist units that can hold areas around Kiyv etc to allow other units to be redeployed. Expect them to be getting almost constant satellite coverage and SIGINT from the West, so they'll know where the next strike is likely to come.

Really it's a race at this point. Ukraine needs to raise new units, reinforce depleted ones and deploy then to the easy. Russia needs to withdraw it's mauled units, reconstitute them, then redeploy them. The rate of Western heavy arms deliveries will be an important factor here.

In terms of predictions - Russia will attack again in the East with renewed vigour. Ukraine shouldn't try and likely won't be about ""hold the line"", but hopefully will trade space for time to deplete the new forces. 

The salient between Donetsk and Izyum is a concern, though whether the Russian forces have the ability to close that off (100km of territory) in the teeth of Ukrainian defenses is another matter. Whether Ukraine tries to extricate itself from that area or holds it to try and tie up Russian forces will be an important strategic decision for them, given the politics of the area and Russia's stated aims I'd lean towards the latter.

A lot depends on how much attrition has impacted the respective materiel of both sides. Russia didn't exactly hold back it's best forces first time, which have been rather roughly handled, however Ukraine has also taken significant losses. In both cases, reserves and replacements will likely be inferior to original personnel and equipment.

Nationalism isn't always a bad thing. We are currently seeing nationalism from both sides in this conflict. But in Ukraine's case nationalism is a survival tool; a reaction to an enemy that is trying to deny their right to exist as a state. Being proud of and having a strong sense of belonging to your county is the only way to survive this.

In Russia's case, their nationalism is their justification for invading another country.

First, as you stated, Russia's doctrine is to reserve nuclear arms for an existential threat.  At the beginning of the war, from the Russian point of view, it was unclear what NATO's response was going to be.  That was evident in the heightened rhetoric that Putin used at the beginning of the conflict, threatening ""consequences beyond imagination"" or whatever if NATO intervened.  That rhetoric has been absent the last few weeks, suggesting that Putin has observed NATO's response and does not consider it necessary to keep sabre-rattling.

Second, Russia's goals in the conflict have proven to be elastic.  The fact that they were willing to accept defeat in the siege of Kyiv (not *admit* defeat, mind you, but accept) shows that they are not all-in for this invasion.  They fell back and regrouped in the Donbas, and their propaganda has now shifted to messaging consistent with a protracted occupation there, rather than a blitz across the whole of Ukraine.  The fact that they are willing to change these objectives after-the-fact means that they don't consider this invasion an existential necessity.

Third, according to polling, support for Putin at home as actually *increased* for the duration of the war.  We can argue about the reliability, but as far as Putin can see, he's in no danger of losing the support of the Russian people.

There is however a big difference between what is known and what is communicated to allies. And there was the issue, there was no trust due to multiple  previous lies to further the US agenda. Why would anyone believe other wise here?

It is not contradictory, the French intel assessed that an invasion of Ukraine would be pyrrhic, and extremely costly for Russia. They also assessed that Putin had multiples options that would be better to topple Ukraine government. Hence there would be no practical reason to escalate further than intimidation at the border. Which was a reasonable risk assessment, especially considering what we know now that the invasion came as a surprise for a lot of Russian official and seems to have been directly ordered by Putin.

The US overestimate the Russian army, and though that Kyiv would fall rapidly, The French assessed that the Russian army would not take Kyiv (Their Embassy never left) without massive loss and would be bogged down in a long war. It is two different situations. If anything the French had a more correct take on what the war would be, their error was to think that Putin would be rational, while the US had better agent closer to Putin.

Usually the rule of thumb is 3-4 wounded per death, but that may not apply here, but I think it is fairly conservative to assume at minimum 30-40k Russian soldiers are dead or wounded/incapacitated. If so, that is a severe blow to many BTG groups, so the estimates that 30-40 battle groups are so degraded as to be unusuable (for at least a few weeks and in many cases almost completely, is I suspect correct. 

This is a rump estimate, and as trustworthy as any rump estimate.  Donbas will probably be a slugfest but I wouldn't assume Russia is going to have it easy there.

I'm not sure how mobile Ukraine can be, but the ability to fight in small groups at night will remain, even if more dangerous in terms of retreating after a strike.

Climate isn’t easy to fix and honestly until we change as around the world nothing will change, btw look up the stuff China was making again that kills the ozone.

I am for immigration but we need to be smart about it because we can’t just open up the borders and let people come in, not because it’s bad, but because we need rules and laws and honestly our states and counties can’t take an influx of millions ppl with open borders.

You’re drinking the koolaid that the media puts out there. Believe it or not this country is just as connected and strong as ever, don’t let the media and the republicans and democrats tell you otherwise. We need to find the common ground in each person and keep pushing forward.

Do you know what happens when you start breaking the rules of war, ESPECIALLY when that involves harming prisoners of war?

It not only drives your enemy to greater atrocities, but it also makes them less likely to surrender. Why bother surrendering to be tortured and killed just to avoid being killed? Better to fight to the last bullet, take as much of the surrounding countryside and populace with you. After all, there's absolutely no reason not to and every reason to do so now.

And this completely leaves out the fact that quite a few countries have political elements that WANT to stop supplying Ukraine, but they don't have anything they can use to get their way because this war is the most clearcut example of a good vs evil war we've had in nearly a century.

 >A suitcase nuclear device (also suitcase nuke, suitcase bomb, backpack nuke, snuke, mini-nuke, and pocket nuke) is a tactical nuclear weapon that is portable enough that it could use a suitcase as its delivery method. Both the United States and the Soviet Union developed nuclear weapons small enough to be portable in specially-designed backpacks during the 1950s and 1960s. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union have ever made public the existence or development of weapons small enough to fit into a normal-sized suitcase or briefcase. The W48 however, does fit the criteria of small, easily disguised, and portable.

>That rhetoric has been absent the last few weeks, suggesting that Putin has observed NATO's response and does not consider it necessary to keep sabre-rattling.

Right, but I think launching nukes because NATO intervened in Ukraine

(which, according to the doctrine according to me, he would only do if NATO entered Russia or had at least been heavily engaged with Russian forces, and leaves out lesser actions that could still be called NATO intervention, like deciding to put troops in western Ukraine or something, that at this point he can see aren't happening. Basically I'm just observing that the phrasing of the initial saber-rattling was outside of doctrine, and we probably didn't have to worry)

is a separate reason from launching nukes because the Russian state was otherwise going to collapse. Though when I say ""state"", I mean his government, and I don't know whether ""state"" in the doctrine means just the government or more the people in the country as a whole.

>Third, according to polling, support for Putin at home as actually increased for the duration of the war. We can argue about the reliability, but as far as Putin can see, he's in no danger of losing the support of the Russian people.

Yes he has gained support, but it's because they want to **support the war** effort. So that could potentially mean even more anger towards him if the war goes badly, especially since I think it's still understood as being more or less his war. I don't know how badly the war can end and Putin still have support. And I don't know how bad an end **he** thinks he can handle.  


So again my thought is that he obviously won't use his nukes if it means MAD, but also that there's a situation in which he decides both that the chances of getting nuked in retaliation for him nuking Ukraine are low enough, that some tactical nukes will convince the Ukrainians to accept some Russian conditions that he can present to his people, and otherwise he's done. The more I type about this situation the less I think it could happen, tbh

I thought I had a remark on your second point, but I forgot, so I guess it's good :PI might say it still leaves room for the possibility that they're not willing to leave completely empty-handed, but also show that they're willing to fall back on pure propaganda in absence of actual results, which we've seen them do a lot of, so that's comforting ig",1649635676.0,1649634108.0,t3_u09mm7,t1_i47ppu9,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

The ROI of solar-panel roofing is at best 10-15 years. The more energy-efficient and cost-effective they get, the more proliferation you'll see as the sooner that return occurs. If you're talking residential adoption, then I imagine everyone would start putting panels up on every square-inch of their property if the return was <5 years. Likewise would such large-scale adoption occur. That only happens through R&D and improving the efficiency and reducing manufacturing costs—no differently than the CPU from the 80s to now.

Combine that was transmission and normalizing the grid in areas of low-sun/high-energy demands (e.g., New England / Mid-west with overcast skies and high energy demands at night to warm homes) via more effective and sustainable energy storage (Where lithium and lead dependencies foster similar issues as does fossil fuels themselves).

Summary:

- We don't have energy surplus because the efficiency of renewables (chiefly solar) and its subsequent ROI is just not that attractive yet.

- Once we have such improvements in cost-effectiveness/efficiency, widespread adoption will occur and surplus handling would occur then. 

- Such R&D into energy-storage has major demands now; chiefly in electric cars and public transportation.

Those videos were posted by civilians of a ship on fire *in port*. There are lots of civilians in ports. There are very few civilians in the sea, and the Russian military is famously unlikely to post videos of themselves being killed.

AShMs are unlikely to be fired at anything on the user's side of the horizon. You even said that. So that limits the likelihood that a civilian would capture a video of a burning ship that had been hit by an AShM.
