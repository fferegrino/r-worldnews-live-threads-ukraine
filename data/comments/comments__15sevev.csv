- Its extremely effective against drones at all velocities (Lancets are also included)

- The system has 3 sensors, including termal camera and a radar.

- Its not a moving truck. Its a rotating system with sensors, then you have the people operating it from complete disconnected place. It can be nearby house or nearby truck.

- The operators will have couple of monitors where they can see the drones and track them. 

- They will engage them and the system will shoot bullets AND 44mm air burst ammunition.

- Much cheaper than using AA for this.

- This will significantly improve UKR anti-drone capabilility. I dont know how many systems that will be delivered.

His condition rapidly deteriorated. Local doctors were unable to make a diagnosis and transported the patient under escort to the Ryazan regional hospital. There he was unexpectedly diagnosed with leukemia and in the evening was transferred to intensive care, where he died. It is strange that such a serious illness was not detected earlier, and the patient died so suddenly. In addition, during hospitalization, all of Lopyrev's indicators were normal: he underwent an ECG and CT scan.

For a little over a year the ruble has been losing value against the dollar (as well as other currencies like the Indian Rupee or Chinese Yuan) however no one seemed to pay much attention to this until suddenly it hit 100 rubles to the dollar at which point it became front page news. Russia responded by immediately hiking interest rates by 350 base points (so now at 12%) and the ruble is now at 94.50 per USD.

The ruble value is certainly worth watching but it should be remembered that it is not necessarily a good indicator of the Russian economy for better or worse and it's not a freely traded currency. Russia can also make hard choices to further increase the value of the ruble like burning more foreign cash reserves and raising rates. These have their own downsides which is why it's unwise to look solely at the ruble's value. If the ruble continues to gain value against the dollar it's not a sign ""sanctions aren't working"" and similarly if the ruble loses value it's not a sign that ""hyperinflation is coming in the next few months and the Russian government will collapse.""

There is a high line of hills that Russia is currently sitting on up to a height of about 350 meters above sealevel, not massive but a very defendable natural feature .At one end of the front you have Robotyne that sits as a defensive blocker to the ridge extending out from these hills.  

&#x200B;

Once Ukraine fully control Robotyne and probably Novoprokivka (expect to see this in around two weeks at current rates) behind it which is right on the southern edge of the ridge they will  have the top of the hills giving them clear lines of sight to Tokmak which brings anything moving on the planes below into real danger from the accurate artillery Ukraine can range up to 10kms behind this ridge and still hit targets around Tokmak. From the top there they can just about see all the way to Melitpol.

&#x200B;

At the other end of this ridge to the east you have the area being fought around Urozhaine.  They are currently working their way up the valley settelment by settlement.  This area is less defended by trenches than further West and possibly less minefields but it is far more defensible from natural features.  I suspect this push is less to get to Mariupol which is the other side of the hills and still a very long way away but more to get to the North side of these hills in a controlling position and cut off Polohy which has been a forward control point for Russia since they stole it in March 2022.

The crest of these hills is between Novopoltavka and Komysh Zorya about 12kms south east of Polohy.  Polohy is supplied by two train routes, one that goes East -  West to Tokmak and another South - North, they both cross at Novopoltavka just off the highest level of the hills.  

I suspect the initial Urozhaine push is heading towards the East/West train tracks between Komysh Zorya and Rozivka,  if they cut this Polohy will be very hard to hold especially with pressure from the Verbove direction to the West where the Robotyne salient is developing.  Once Polohy has become untenable,  the rail crossing and the heights will be the next target.

If they control these heights they have fire control all the way down to the sea and have cut off all East to West supply with fire control over South to North so Vesylivka, Enerhodar, Tokmak etc become untenable.",False,1692192426.0,t3_15sevev,t1_jwf4kkh,,2,21,0,21,0,0,

For instance 5,000,000 dollars worth of 155mm shells is probably a lot more useful than one five million dollar tank but NATO doesn’t have infinite reserves of shells and has already given Ukraine a good portion of the existing stockpile. If NATO decides NOT to give the tank it doesn’t mean that previously non existent shells suddenly become available it just means Ukraine won’t have that tank.

For sure, and they can be a legitimate threat. Is it significant enough to render the carrier helpless in a conflict? No. That’s what the rest of the Carrier Strike Group is for. Just as there have been advances in anti-ship ballistic missiles, there have been advances in ballistic missile detection and interception. Aegis is nuts. 

And it’s not just me believe if this, if the concept of the aircraft carrier was dead, China wouldn’t be fitting out their 3rd carrier with 4 more planned in the future. 

It’s not that simple to chalk it up to more numbers + simpler = better. We’ve seen superior technology tear through more numerous and less advanced technology before too, like in Desert Storm.  Or even in Ukraine, where GMLRS like HIMARS were in short number but still proved utterly catastrophic for the Russian offensive when they were introduced, killing off the momentum they had gained while taking Sevierodonetsk. 

The problem with simple solutions is that a nation with sufficient means can nullify their advantage. Take drones for example. Ukraine is having a rough time facing cheap drones like the Lancet and swarms of shaheds. But a lot of the reason behind that is that Ukraine sadly does not have a robust EW grid for CUAS. The Russians on the other hand, surprisingly enough, have a pretty solid EW grid. Ukraine loses an absurd amount of drones every month (20k iirc, it’s wild) to jamming and such.

And this made savings in rubles more profitable. The people began to buy less currency, the demand for it fell and its ""price"" decreased.

When I asked him about how effective it was, he said that at 2000 yards, your first hit could be as much as +/-200 yards in range and +/- 60 yards in windage.  But what he said was if your followup rounds hit in generally the same spot, you could rather quickly adjust fire and start hitting within 50 yards range and 25 yards windage.  Which is fine when you're dropping HE rounds on infantry (the kill radius is like 40 yards), but not that great when you're trying to hit a vehicle column or a building.

And there are a TON of variables involved.  Wind, humidity, air temp, barrel temp, hell even manufacturing quality of the rounds and lifting charges.

But, as you say, they do have uses.  Being able to tactically deploy 3-6 small artillery pieces with a range of up to 2 miles that can rapid fire a combined 60-120 rounds in a minute can absolutely be a game changer in terms of small-unit engagements.

>To qualify as a blockade, Russia’s operation must have been declared with specificity as to the starting time, geographical limits, and period for neutral vessel exit (San Remo Manual, paras 93-94; Newport Manual, § 7.4.2). The San Remo Manual commentary notes that this would ordinarily include a Notice to Mariners and communication to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) (pp. 172, 177). The London Declaration concerning the Laws of Naval Warfare (1909) specifies direct notification to neutral states and local authorities (article 11). It is at least questionable that the Russian Ministry of Defense message on Telegram specifying that “all vessels sailing in the waters of the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports will be regarded as potential carriers of military cargo” after 00.00 Moscow time on Jul. 20, 2023 was addressed or specified in the ways necessary to satisfy these criteria. No declaration of blockade appears to have been circulated via the IMO. Additionally, to qualify as a legal blockade under the law of naval warfare, the encirclement must be enforced effectively and impartially on ships of all nations (San Remo Manual, paras 95, 100; Newport Manual, §§ 7.4.3, 7.4.4). If it does not satisfy those requirements, Russia’s operation would not gain the broader law-of-blockade permissions regarding the capture or targeting of neutral merchant vessels carrying Ukrainian exports.

You actually have to do so through the IMO, which Russia didn't do as far as I'm aware. Since Russia did not do so it means that they don't have a legal blockade and thus the ships from different countries aren't allowed to be legally seized.

There is also the question on the purpose of the blockade. If it's for economic warfare it'd be legal. If it's to starve other countries and force them to lift sanctions on Russia then it'd be an illegal blockade.",False,1692216146.0,t3_15sevev,t1_jwh0cfr,,7,3,0,3,0,0,
