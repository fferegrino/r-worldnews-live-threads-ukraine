Time to put it straight. I am Ukrainian. I was on my first revolution, when I was 5 years old, sitting on my father's shoulders and screaming ""Yushchenko!"". My second revolution happened as I've turned 14, I still remember showing middle fingers to police from my classroom's window. Then the war happened. For 8 years each day me and my were receiving news about Ukrainian casualties, each day we would pray that no Ukrainian soldiers would be hurt. At that point I have a lot of friends in the military, reserves, territorial defence. And there is not much compassion left.  
  
Too many Ukrainian civilians killed, wounded and displaced. Too many sleepless nights. The only thing I want now, is to see free Ukraine without any danger from the Russia and Putin hanging by his neck. Russians can always desert and surrender. But when they shoot at my people - you can't expect any empathy. They have a choice. Our only choice - to defend our country

*American tank mechanic here. Some advice.

Tanks are bad at urban combat. They need infantry support. Without boots on ground they’re just big targets with poor visibility. Rifles should aim for the periscopes, but most importantly the sight unit on top of the turret.

Take down street signs. Don’t let the enemy know where they are. Move signs to the wrong streets. Tanks are super heavy, so try to direct them to streets that can’t hold their weight. They can’t move if they break through to the sewer.*

“All of this is now happening within the city limits,” reports CNN’s Clarissa Ward, but it doesn’t appear to have reached the centre.

There are no signs of residential areas being targeted yet, she says, “but we’re hearing a lot of explosions from many different directions.”

Interfax Ukraine news agency reports Russian forces have tried to attack an electricity-generating station, while the Ukrainian military says it has repelled an attack on a Kyiv army base, according to Reuters.

The Ukrainian government also says it stopped a Russian advancement down Peremohy Avenue - which runs past the Beresteiska metro station, where heavy fighting has also been reported. The Guardian has not independently verified the reports.

The assault appears to line up with Zelensky’s warning that tonight could see Russia’s attempt to storm the city. Three million people call Kyiv home.

Earlier Zelensky posted a video from the streets in Kyiv. “Tonight, they will launch an assault. All of us must understand what awaits us. We must withstand this night,” he said. “The fate of Ukraine is being decided right now.”",False,1645842863.0,t3_t1lgcc,t3_t1lgcc,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

It leads me to believe that Russia thought they could establish a far enough breach into enemy territory that logistics would flow easily and with little harassment. Or alternatively that they could nut it out in a day. Obviously they didn't plan for what would happen if that didn't work out.

They should've had logistics warehouses near the border, heavy supply & repair depots in the rear echelon, smaller supply contingents (company-sized elements) behind the front line, and integral support for every company and/or battalion. It honestly astounds me how disorganized their logistics are, no modern military should be this underprepared logistically when they're fighting so close to home.

Russia has yet to publish official numbers on the number of casualties inflicted upon their forces, and their propaganda about what victories they've had seem to be heavily fabricated. Why aren't we seeing much of their supposed air superiority if they've really disabled Ukraine's AA capabilities as they've claimed? Why are they shutting down cameras in retreat if they're trying to show the world that they're winning the war?  
Apart from Belarus, none of Russia's other closest allies are showing strong support for the invasion. The writing is on the wall, and the world seems to believe that Putin's defeat is inevitable in the grand scheme of things. It's only been a few days since the start of the war, and Putin's been humiliated in a way he's never been before as Russia's leader.

> Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov (Russian: Станисла́в Евгра́фович Петро́в; 7 September 1939 – 19 May 2017) was a lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defence Forces who played a key role in the 1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident. On 26 September 1983, three weeks after the Soviet military had shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, Petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the Oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the United States, followed by up to five more. Petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm, and his decision to disobey orders, against Soviet military protocol, is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the United States and its NATO allies that could have resulted in a large-scale nuclear war which could have wiped out half of the population of the countries involved. An investigation later confirmed that the Soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned. Because of his decision not to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike amid this incident, Petrov is often credited as having ""saved the world"".",False,1645845178.0,t3_t1lgcc,t1_hygv2gh,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

As for 1)  Putin hasn't acted as a rational actor, however usage of tactical nuclear weapons in conventional warfare supposedly is an (untested) component in Russian doctrine.   Since nothing about this invasion has been rational, there's honestly no telling how far he would go.   The longer it goes on, the more extreme measures he might take to get things back under control.   Hopefully the US using the two nuclear weapons at the end of World War II to force a surrender on Japan isn't going to be an inspiration to him.

And 2)  This is a question that has no answer.   There is no modern legal precedent for it.

>	The Finns' policy was to allow the Russian tanks to penetrate their defences, even inducing them to do so by 'canalising' them through gaps and concentrating their small arms fire on the infantry following them. The tanks that penetrated were taken on by gun fire in the open and by small parties of men armed with explosive charges and petrol bombs in the forests and villages... The essence of the policy was the separation of the AFVs from the infantry, as once on their own the tank has many blind spots and once brought to a stop can be disposed of at leisure.

This can be seen in their movements, with constant pushing towards high value targets.

The problem they have now is they have forces in the capital whilst finding it difficult to get in reinforcements by air due to the heavier than expected Ukrainian resistance at key airfields and landing sites, and because of the speed of their movements their supply chain isn't robust enough to cope with Ukrainian ambushes along the roads.

It's now just past 4AM in Kyiv, and the Battle of Kyiv is now intensifying. Russian forces are attacking from an airfield in the South, and have entered the city from the West while also fighting in the Northern suburbs. Social media videos show heavy fighting, including around the Kyiv Zoo as Russian troops continue to press into the city center. There is also heavy fighting over the CHP-6 power plant, the largest in the country, near Kyiv. There is also heavy fighting in Kharkiv again tonight, a city not far from the Russian border and the Russian city of Belgorod where a large number of forces were believed to have amassed.  
  
Earlier, Ukrainian media reported that Russian saboteurs had entered the city to mark targets and urged civilians to try and destroy those targets. They claim to have rounded up over 100 saboteurs. The Ukrainian government also claims to have shot down at least two Russian transports so far tonight, each capable of holding as many as 100 paratroopers. They also claim to have held the city of Kherson in the South after a Ukrainian air strike forced Russian troops off, a key city that Russia is seeking to take to provide water supplies to Crimea and also to pave the way for taking the city of Odesa in the South.  
  
Amidst all this, there are reports that the US and French have offered to escort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy out of Kyiv to a safer city in the West to continue to coordinate the war, but he has refused these offers and remains in the city. The Biden administration continues to consider ways to provide more lethal aid to Ukraine, but it is likely that the outcome of the battle tonight will be pivotal in terms of how the rest of this war plays out.",False,1645844450.0,t3_t1lgcc,t1_hygudg1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

-A lotttttt of amazing lines said by UA against the Russians.

-Russian kicked out of Council of Europe
-China’s banks have stopped dealing with certain Russians but seemingly that’s the most we’ll see from them

Making out like these are the actions of an unstable individual leader if a nation gone rogue is disingenuous in the extreme. Read some history and listen to some actual foreign policy experts (rather than the numerous shills).

NATO has been expanding its influence in the region for literally decades, in defiance of an agreement between Bush 1 and Gorbachev (which resulted in the re-united Germany joining NATO in return for NATO agreeing not to expand its influence Eastward).

Military and political expansionism is a zero sum game - the expansion of US / NATO influence in the Eastern bloc comes at the cost of diminished Russian influence. This isn’t a problem if you view Russia as the “baddies”, but they have been cast in that role and then forced to act it out by the actions of the West.

This isn’t a kids’ cartoon; it can’t be understood in terms as simple as goodies and baddies.

None of that diminishes the horror that the Ukrainians are being subjected to, or who is responsible for subjecting them to it. However it does help to explain how the situation came about, which may be helpful to understand how it might be resolved (or at least how to prevent it from happening again in future).

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

Chechens care about two things, Chechnya and what their war lord says. Kadyrov pulls most weightin Chechnya whether you want to admit it or not, so the bulk of experienced chechen forces are under him and loyal to him. They want the opportunity to go in to battle with a chechen flag, their extremist. It's why Russia jad such a hard time with them and why they take good care of them now

>It's not a religious war.

I said that, in my comment. But there are troops of differing religions who are highly religious clashing. Ukranians will be going in to war after parying and kissing crosses, these chechens are literal Islamic extremist so will be waging every battle for the ""glory"" of Chechnya and Allah in their minds.

Russia is effectively betting everything on this fight. The ""why"" no longer REALLY matters because there's no just backing off of this and going ""Well that was a fun couple days, right guys?"", but the ""why"" is ostensibly so that Russia doesn't share a border with a NATO nation.

So lets say things start going seriously bad for the Russian military, as in, they could PROBABLY take Kyiv and the surrounding major cities but it's going to take months and many hundreds of tanks (I think the official count is 60+ lost), etc.

Putin could decide to drop a nuke on Kyiv to try and force a surrender through the remaining government or through demoralizing the Ukrainian troops (note: I kinda get the sense that this would have the opposite effect).

Furthermore, in the most insane style, he could decide ""A radioactive cratered hellscape is a FINE buffer zone."" and just blast apart the countryside. At that point if Ukraine wanted to join NATO, likely NATO nations would get ""sucked dry"" of resources with aid to help Ukraine rebuild (honestly I don't think it would have that huge of an effect economically/industrially on NATO nations, but would of course set back Ukraine for decades or even centuries).

The powerful (as in *rich*) nations of the world did not want to facilitate a system where by ""99%"" of the countries could decide ""to have them for dinner"".

The real issue here is that these super-national organizations are delicate when there simply is no binding higher authority.  This also applies at the national level.  The first attempt at a United States government failed for a similar reason.  Things wouldn't or couldn't work if the national government was too weak compared to the state governments.  And then, one could argue, even this second attempt (US Constitution) was sorely tested via the US Civil War.  You can see a similar pattern in the tug-and-pull in the EU.

To create a powerful block, the individual states need to cede power to some degree.  Well, when you consider this at the world level we have some rather serious power, wealth and population imbalances across the nations.

Maybe some day the rest of the nations will create a different thing and force the big five to do things a different way.  For this to happen, however, we'd need two things:

* The big five would need the rest of the world more than the reverse.
* The big countries beyond the top five would need to be willing to forego the same perks as they write the new rules.
