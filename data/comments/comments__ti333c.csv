Day 24 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

It was quiet for the most part today where I am, the loudest shelling happened just around 5 am. But at the same time 3 hours ago there was shelling in Saltivka district and something caught on fire so the whole sky was bright orange, that district has been under constant shelling almost every day, so much of it is already destroyed and it’s basically the biggest residential district of our city.

I continue reading comments from Russians and speaking to Russian people and it honestly makes my blood boil, they are completely delusional, they actually think that when this ends everything will return to normal and we will make peace with each other, what the hell are they smoking?

This will never be forgotten by anyone here, they have made for themselves a mortal enemy for at least the next 100 years right at their border but they still continue to think that everything is fine and that people here just can’t wait to be liberated from “Nazis” and be reunited with their “Russian brothers”. 

Russian mentality is a plague that shouldn’t exist; from childhood people there are taught that you should only live with other Slavs like a herd, they say that nobody needs you anywhere else and your place is only in Russia. 

What makes the least sense to me is that a lot of them say that “if you go to EU/USA you have to work there” the hell? Are you saying that you don’t have to work here and you still get paid? They try their best to discourage you from even as much as thinking about leaving your “motherland”, their mentality is isolationist from the start and they think that every other previous USSR nation is the same as them, well then, they are in for a rude awakening after this ends, or maybe not, but then they will become the next North Korea.

When this ends I will be definitely going around Kharkiv and documenting all of the destruction that they have caused, probably as a YouTube series, so that nobody will have any more illusions about who is the real Nazi here. I can literally see a hole from shelling in an apartment building (thankfully there are no people living in it) not that far away from me from my window and after this they are still asking us why we hate Russians now?

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, March 19

Frederick W. Kagan, George Barros, and Kateryna Stepanenko

March 19, 3 pm ET

Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war. That campaign aimed to conduct airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and other major Ukrainian cities to force a change of government in Ukraine. That campaign has culminated. Russian forces continue to make limited advances in some parts of the theater but are very unlikely to be able to seize their objectives in this way. The doctrinally sound Russian response to this situation would be to end this campaign, accept a possibly lengthy operational pause, develop the plan for a new campaign, build up resources for that new campaign, and launch it when the resources and other conditions are ready. The Russian military has not yet adopted this approach. It is instead continuing to feed small collections of reinforcements into an ongoing effort to keep the current campaign alive. We assess that that effort will fail.

The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

Russian forces in the south appear to be focusing on a drive toward Kryvyi Rih, presumably to isolate and then take Zaporizhiya and Dnipro from the west but are unlikely to secure any of those cities in the coming weeks if at all. Kryvyi Rih is a city of more than 600,000 and heavily fortified according to the head of its military administration. Zaporizhiya and Dnipro are also large. The Russian military has been struggling to take Mariupol, smaller than any of them, since the start of the war with more combat power than it is currently pushing toward Kryvyi Rih. The Russian advance on that axis is thus likely to bog down as all other Russian advances on major cities have done.

The Russian military continues to commit small groups of reinforcements to localized fighting rather than concentrating them to launch new large-scale operations. Russia continues to commit units drawn from its naval infantry from all fleets, likely because those units are relatively more combat-ready than rank-and-file Russian regiments and brigades. The naval infantry belonging to the Black Sea Fleet is likely the largest single pool of ready reserve forces the Russian military has not yet committed. Much of that naval infantry has likely been embarked on amphibious landing ships off the Odesa coast since early in the war, presumably ready to land near Odesa as soon as Russian forces from Crimea secured a reliable ground line of communication (GLOC) from Crimea to Odesa. The likelihood that Russian forces from Crimea will establish such a GLOC in the near future is becoming remote, however, and the Russian military has apparently begun using elements of the Black Sea Fleet naval infantry to reinforce efforts to take Mariupol.

The culmination of the initial Russian campaign is creating conditions of stalemate throughout most of Ukraine. Russian forces are digging in around the periphery of Kyiv and elsewhere, attempting to consolidate political control over areas they currently occupy, resupplying and attempting to reinforce units in static positions, and generally beginning to set conditions to hold in approximately their current forward positions for an indefinite time. Maxar imagery of Russian forces digging trenches and revetments in Kyiv Oblast over the past several days supports this assessment.[1] Comments by Duma members about forcing Ukraine to surrender by exhaustion in May could reflect a revised Russian approach to ending this conflict on terms favorable to Moscow.

Stalemate will likely be very violent and bloody, especially if it protracts. Stalemate is not armistice or ceasefire. It is a condition in war in which each side conducts offensive operations that do not fundamentally alter the situation. Those operations can be very damaging and cause enormous casualties. The World War I battles of the Somme, Verdun, and Passchendaele were all fought in conditions of stalemate and did not break the stalemate. If the war in Ukraine settles into a stalemate condition Russian forces will continue to bomb and bombard Ukrainian cities, devastating them and killing civilians, even as Ukrainian forces impose losses on Russian attackers and conduct counter-attacks of their own. The Russians could hope to break Ukrainians’ will to continue fighting under such circumstances by demonstrating Kyiv’s inability to expel Russian forces or stop their attacks even if the Russians are demonstrably unable to take Ukraine’s cities. Ukraine’s defeat of the initial Russian campaign may therefore set conditions for a devastating protraction of the conflict and a dangerous new period testing the resolve of Ukraine and the West. Continued and expanded Western support to Ukraine will be vital to seeing Ukraine through that new period.

Key Takeaways:

We now assess that the initial Russian campaign to seize Ukraine’s capital and major cities and force regime change has failed;
Russian forces continue efforts to restore momentum to this culminated campaign, but those efforts will likely also fail;
Russian troops will continue trying to advance to within effective artillery range of the center of Kyiv, but prospects for their success are unclear;
The war will likely descend into a phase of bloody stalemate that could last for weeks or months;
Russia will expand efforts to bombard Ukrainian civilians in order to break Ukrainians’ will to continue fighting (at which the Russians will likely fail);
The most dangerous current Russian advance is from Kherson north toward Kryvyi Rih in an effort to isolate Zaporizhiya and Dnipro from the west. Russian forces are unlikely to be able to surround or take Kryvyi Rih in the coming days, and may not be able to do so at all without massing much larger forces for the effort than they now have available on that axis;

> 
> By Peter Landers and Alastair Gale
> 
> March 19, 2022 9:00 am ET
> 
> Today’s headlines echo many wars in the Russian and Soviet past. History records tales of undersupplied Russian conscript soldiers, high inflation and industrial breakdowns during wartime, and tyrants surrounded by flatterers.
> 
> **The Russo-Japanese War (1904-05)**
> 
> The war between Russia and Japan, fought over hegemony in Northeast Asia, showed the risks of overconfidence by Moscow when facing a smaller rival.
> 
> Unlike the Ukraine war, this one wasn’t started by Russia. Tokyo seized the initiative with a surprise attack on the Russian navy at Port Arthur in Russia’s Far East. Czar Nicholas II decided to fight back with full force, figuring that Japan, barely a half-century after emerging from feudal isolation, was no match for a European army.
> 
> He underestimated his opponent. Around one-quarter of 340,000 Russian troops were killed in a battle near what is now the Chinese city of Shenyang as Japan committed almost its entire army to the fight. In the decisive blow, Japan sank or captured most of the 45 ships in Russia’s Baltic Fleet after it sailed around the globe.
> 
> **World War I (1914-18)**
> 
> Nicholas II was still in power when the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, set off the pan-European crisis that resulted in World War I. Though it is remembered by many for trench warfare on the Western Front, “as much as anything, World War I turned on the fate of Ukraine,” writes historian Dominic Lieven in “The End of Tsarist Russia.”
> 
> As the czar led the Russian military into the fight against Germany on the Eastern Front, the initial patriotic fervor quickly soured. It became clear that the Russian military was ill-prepared, with particular shortcomings in motorized vehicles and communications equipment, according to Peter Gatrell of the University of Manchester. When the war dragged on, Russian industry was too feeble to fully resupply the military and inflation surged.
> 
> In the revolution year of 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in March and Bolsheviks led by Vladimir Lenin seized power in November. In March 1918, Russia gave up vast territories in a peace treaty with Germany signed at Brest-Litovsk in what is now Belarus, near where Russia-Ukraine peace talks have taken place recently.
> 
> **Soviet War in Afghanistan (1979-89)**
> 
> The plan for Afghanistan resembled the one that Mr. Putin’s generals appear to have crafted for Ukraine—quickly seize power in the capital, oust the leader and replace him with one loyal to Moscow. The Afghan plan worked, at least at first, as Soviet forces assassinated the president in December 1979 and brought in a Moscow favorite.
> 
> What the Soviets hadn’t planned for was the lengthy and bloody occupation that followed. Benjamin Denison, a nonresident fellow at the think tank Defense Priorities who is writing a book about occupations, said intervening powers often assume incorrectly that everything will be fine once they get rid of a leader they don’t like.
> 
> Soviet forces’ humiliating retreat and the cost in lives fed rising discontent at home. Bungled occupations tend to “lead to much more questioning of the basis of the rule, especially among authoritarian regimes,” said Mr. Denison. “You do get domestic unrest: ‘Why is this taking so long? We were told this was going to be a quick mission.’ ”
> 
> In 1991, Communist rule in Russia ended, and the Soviet Union was dissolved. One result of the de facto revolution: Ukraine became an independent nation. Today it fights to preserve that independence.

Is there not the possibility that this is all to make a “deal” involving Crimea and Donbas more palatable in negotiations? 

If everyone is convinced that Russia has a grand conquest plan, yet only ends up with a few territories in eastern Ukraine and a ceasefire is called, that would certainly feel like a win.

I feel like that slip-up in Putin’s meeting prior to the invasion, where the top Russian spy accidentally said “accept Donbas into the Russian federation” (instead of “recognise their independence”), was quite telling. I’m tempted to believe that annexing the Donbas, and perhaps the coastline of the Black Sea, has been the plan all along.

Assuming the damn things actually work as advertised (a big assumption), they're potentially game-changers as *anti-ship* missiles. As in, anti-carrier.

Carriers are one of the main pillars of American force projection. Everybody in these threads should know the background by now; twice as much carrier space as the whole world put together, etc etc. Carriers are a big part of how the US can be the backbone of NATO in Europe while simultaneously projecting power in the Pacific, all while maintaining the safety of North America. A legitimate threat to carriers with no reliable countermeasures would have massive, far-reaching geopolitical consequences. These things could be to carriers what the Javelin etc are to tanks. And it's no hyperbole to say that has huge implications for the entire post-1945 balance of power.

Using one in a place they know for a fact the West is already watching closely implies Russia wants to brag about them for whatever reason, which is significant. Revealing those capabilities gives the US quantitative targets to plan next-generation anti-missile missiles around. In other words, this is what you need to detect a launch, your counter-missile needs to be this fast, and fired this soon after detection, and needs to carry this much explosive, etc. 

And of course there's still the possibility that Russia hasn't actually developed something that can track a mobile target or defeat already existing anti-missile defenses, and they just fired off a fancy cruise missile.

> **Musk sent terminals for the satellite Internet service after a Ukrainian official tweeted at him**

> Elon Musk recently challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a one-handed fistfight for the future of Ukraine. But the entrepreneur’s real defense of the besieged country is his effort to keep Ukrainians online with shipments of Starlink satellite Internet service.

> Starlink is a unit of Musk’s space company, SpaceX. The service uses terminals that resemble TV dishes equipped with antennas and are usually mounted on roofs to access the Internet via satellite in rural or disconnected areas.

> When war broke out in Ukraine, the country faced threats of Russian cyberattacks and shelling that had the potential to take down the Internet, making it necessary to develop a backup plan. So the country’s minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted a direct plea to Musk urging him to send help. Musk replied just hours later: “Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route.”

> Ukraine has already received thousands of antennas from Musk’s companies and European allies, which has proved “very effective,” Fedorov said in an interview with The Washington Post Friday.

> “The quality of the link is excellent,” Fedorov said through a translator, using a Starlink connection from an undisclosed location. “We are using thousands, in the area of thousands, of terminals with new shipments arriving every other day.”

> The use of Starlink as a stopgap measure for citizens and the government to stay connected during an invasion is a major test of the relatively new technology, experts say, and could have widespread implications for the future of war. Internet has become an essential tool for communication, staying informed and even powering weapons.

> It’s also a test for Musk. The world’s richest man, valued at $232 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaire‘s Index, makes a habit of turning to Twitter for brash promises and proclamations in the midst of world crises. Already this week, the Tesla CEO has challenged Putin to a fight and followed up by pledging he would use just one hand if Putin was scared.

 2) ""... --- Russian surface-to-air missile capabilities can reach anywhere in Ukraine, according to military analysts. Russia is believed to fly some 200 sorties per day while Ukraine flies five to 10.""

3) In the first week of the war, it is not clear how many Russian strikes hit their targets, but Piotr Lukasiewicz, an analyst at Polityka Insight, a Warsaw-based research institute, said that they did serious damage to Ukraine’s command and control centers.""

4) “They disabled an important headquarters and communications center in the beginning with precision strikes,” he said.

5) ""Just as the Russians are plagued by logistical and resupply issues, the Ukrainians are struggling to replace the stationary systems that the Russians have destroyed or disabled.""

6) “Gradually Ukrainians are losing their radars or warning systems,” Mr. Lukasiewicz said.

7) We have to consider the possibility that the Russians have been holding back the bulk of its air force until Ukrainian air defenses have been sufficiently degraded. Russia appears to be relying on long range missiles to hit key air defense facilities.

8) Disabling a sophisticated air defense network doesn't happen overnight. It can take weeks to accomplish. If true, this is evidence that the Russians were prepared for a lengthy campaign.

9) The sortie ratio of 200 to 5/10 a day in favor of Russia shows that the Russians have a distinct advantage in the air. And this part of the reason Zelensky is pleading for a no-fly zone.

10) One last note: @nytimes said the Russians are ""dominant"" in the air but then says they don't have Air Superiority. This might be splitting hairs, but that is somewhat contradictory. NATO defines Air Superiority as follows:

11) ""That degree of dominance in the air battle of one force over another which permits the conduct of operations by the former and its related land, sea and air forces at a given time and place without prohibitive interference by the opposing force.""

12) To be clear, I am not saying the Russians have Air Superiority (it sounds like they are on the cusp), but @nytimes is using terminology that implies it does.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/syrians-join-russian-ranks-in-ukraine-as-putin-calls-in-assads-debt

Syrians have shown a readiness to sign up at least 14 recruitment centres across the country, in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir Azzour, Homs and Hama, as well as Raqqa, which less than five years ago was at the centre of the war against Islamic State.

“They have been arriving in the dozens to the regime base in Raqqa,” said a Kurdish fighter with the Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria. “We can see them turn up. The Russians have also asked [Kurdish groups] to join them, but I don’t know of anyone who has done so yet.”

In western Syria, some of the regime’s most prestigious units claim to have signed up thousands from their ranks. The Fifth Division, which was trained by Moscow, the 4th Division, which is loyal to Assad’s brother, Maher, and the Tiger Forces, which played prominent roles in the war, are all central to the recruitment push, which will seriously stretch their already depleted ranks and potentially turn Assad’s ragtag army into the largest mercenary force in Ukraine.

Comparatively safe in his palace thanks to Russian backing, and in the debt of Putin if he wants to remain there, Assad appears to have given Moscow carte blanche to airlift his army, and his commanders free rein to enlist them. The vulnerable state that leaves his forces at home seems secondary to returning a favour that the Syrian leader has no other way to honour.

Ukrainian officials say the mercenary force will fly from the Khmeimim base on daily military transport flights. Militia groups that had fought alongside them are also joining the recruitment drive, with Palestinians, National Defence Front troops, the Ba’ath party and even some members of Shia militia groups that fought in Syria under Iran’s auspices joining in.",False,1647738754.0,t3_ti333c,t3_ti333c,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Sunday, March 20, 2022 
By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --China and Russia’s trade relationship has become more complicated since the war started more than three weeks ago, raising questions about the future flow of energy, metals and crops between the two powerhouses.
Before the war in Ukraine, Russia’s importance to China as a supplier of raw materials was only growing. That was solidified in the “no-limits” friendship announced between the two nations ahead of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, which was celebrated with the signing of new deals to furnish China with Russian oil, gas and wheat.

Immediately after the invasion, Chinese officials said they disagreed with unilateral sanctions and would continue normal trade relations with Russia. But since then banks have paused financing purchases and traders are grappling with logistics, while more recently China’s foreign minister said Beijing doesn’t want to be affected by sanctions.

Here’s a look at where commodities trading with Russia stands and how it might play out.


 

Energy

The biggest trade opportunities may be in energy. The growth in its economy means China has an ever-expanding need for coal and gas to heat homes and power factories. The nation is coal-rich but still prone to shortages, and relatively gas-poor, making imports crucial for keeping up with demand. 

Russia is now the second-largest shipper of coal to China after Indonesia, while its gas exports have grown considerably since the Power of Siberia pipeline began flowing in 2019. Crude shipments have also ticked higher in recent years -- including pipeline oil, Russia was the No. 2 supplier to China in 2021, behind only Saudi Arabia. 

Russian coal has helped fill the gap caused by China’s ban on Australian shipments since late 2020, and more recent disruptions to cargoes from Mongolia and Indonesia. Moreover, the U.S. and Australia supply China with a little over half of its imports of liquefied natural gas, which move by ship, and that’s a dependency which Beijing has been trying to break.

But following the invasion, Chinese buyers, and the lenders that finance their purchases, have largely shunned Russian shipments of coal and LNG as well as crude. That hesitancy may be temporary given the unknown end-point of international action against Moscow. But it could also reflect companies’ deeper concerns about becoming ensnared in sanctions that could affect global banking arrangements, as well as the government’s fears over getting shut out of far more important markets for Chinese goods.

“For any Chinese firm with substantial operations abroad, continued access to the U.S. financial system is more valuable than any deals it can do with Russia, though some small firms may be willing to run the risk,” Capital Economics said in a note last week.

Yellen Says China Moves Not Diluting Russia Sanctions Sting

Logistics are also an issue. Several Chinese coal importers and Russian miners met this month to discuss boosting volumes, but cited several obstacles, including whether China's yuan-based cross-border payment system will be usable, as well as issues with transportation capacity and coal quality, according to the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association.

For sure, China is committed to the long-term success of Russia’s biggest energy projects. Another gas pipeline is under discussion, and Wood Mackenzie Ltd. estimates China’s oil and gas investments in its neighbor at $24 billion, including stakes in the Yamal and Arctic LNG projects in Russia. 

There’s no way that China would follow international companies and exit its Russian energy assets, said Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based senior energy analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “China has this huge growth opportunity for Russia.”

Under those circumstances, it’d be odd for China to cut back on Russian LNG purchases over the longer term. But the outlook for coal is entirely different. Russian sales are almost a rounding error compared to the 4 billion tons of fuel that’s mined domestically, and Beijing’s plan to raise the capacity of its coal industry by 300 million tons would suggest it’s seeking to enhance its energy security by doing away with imports entirely. 

For crude, the calculation also revolves around freight rates, and the high premiums attached to Russian shipments because of the war. There are a lot of nations supplying China with oil, and even when prices are sky-high, that allows buyers to be a bit more picky.

Russian Oil Sales Going Underground as Cheap Crude Tempts Buyers

Grains

Rising transportation costs are also the likely impediment to Moscow expanding its grain sales. Russia sells wheat to more than 100 countries, but China has been one of the few big markets it’s struggled to crack. Until recently, shipments were limited because most Russian wheat was banned due to fungus concerns.

In February, China gave the green light to import wheat from all over Russia as part of the raft of deals sealed during Vladimir Putin’s visit to Beijing. The move was expected to challenge sales from the likes of France, Australia, Canada and the U.S.

But even though the restrictions have been lifted, China is likely to continue importing from its usual sources, said Darin Friedrichs, co-founder and market research director of Sitonia Consulting in Shanghai.

“I don’t think it’s feasible to import huge amounts from new sources like Russia. They will have to pay more,” he said.

Metals

For some metals, China’s dependency on Russia has only weakened in recent years. Indonesia has emerged as its main supplier of nickel. And even though Russia’s share of refined copper imports has risen, the expansion of China’s smelting industry means that the import of ore directly from miners in places such as South America has become more important.

In any case, China is already buying most of Russia’s refined copper exports, according to a note from UBS AG this week, which suggests the upside is limited.

For palladium, which is chiefly used to cut car pollution, Russia’s exports to China have increased in recent years, and could theoretically rise further. A potential obstacle, according to UBS, is that companies listed in Europe produce most of the catalytic converters sold in China, and they may not want Russian supply.",False,1647744503.0,t3_ti333c,t3_ti333c,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

The Ukrainian government supports a NFZ, are they just really stupid? Yes, obviously there's a risk of it spiralling into a huge war, and the supporters of it know that, but they think the risk is worth taking to avoid the consequences of doing nothing, reasoning that Russia may well back down knowing they're facing overwhelming odds against a NATO air force. Are they right? In my opinion no, not yet, it's still way too risky and not worth it (maybe if something big changes like Russia starts using WMDs I might change my mind), but they're not just idiots.

I mean everything we do is taking risks. Russia said sanctions are an act of war and threatened to bomb convoys supporting Ukraine, so there's a small risk that could lead to war but we did it anyway. We obviously need to balance the very real risk of over-escalation but we can't just be like ""lol might lead to WW3 which would mean we all die so we should just not do it"" and allow Putin to escalate forever unhindered. By that logic Putin could say ""I'm gonna bomb NATO territory and if you try to stop me I'll nuke you"", then should NATO just accept, to avoid nuclear war? What if he demanded the US pay Russia $10 trillion or he'll nuke the world. Like you clearly have to call bluffs at some point. We're not at that point yet but point is, people who want to call his bluff aren't just misunderstanding what NFZ means.",False,1647738198.0,t3_ti333c,t3_ti333c,,0,2,0,2,0,0,

-They were at Kherson, as part of a meeting with other leadership coordinating operations along the South Ukraine and Black Sea coast, and were killed in that strike we already knew about. Or it could have been any similar leadership meeting on shore that was targeted. This is my top assumption.

-They were aboard that one ship that got hit by unguided rockets and was damaged, and were killed/injured and we're only learning about it now as Russia internally confirms it. This seems very unlikely to me.

-They were aboard a ship that struck a mine/was attacked and we have yet to hear about the actual incident. Also seems unlikely to me.

-Friendly fire? I recall rumors of near mutiny aboard the fleet bound for Odessa, which had been speculated as a reason they failed to land there. Personally I think they have been keeping the ships near to threaten Odessa in theory while siphoning their landing force into the battle around Kherson/Mariupol, which maybe links back to my first guess.

""Nowhere are we as dependent as with gas

No Russian raw material is as important for Germany as natural gas!

In the past ten years, gas imports in Germany have increased by 17 percent to 1,600 terawatt hours.

► Gas is the number one heating medium. 31 percent of imports are burned by private households.

► Industry needs natural gas, e.g. B. for their chemical plants, consumes 36 percent of gas imports.

► Ten percent of our electricity comes from gas power plants.

Dependence on Russia? Solid! Around 55 percent of our imported gas comes from there.

""We can only partially replace the import of Russian natural gas as of today,"" warns Kerstin Andreae, General Manager of the Federal Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW).

An Uber driver who lived in both Ukraine and Russia told me that in Russia only the elites can do what they want and others have to follow the rules. In Ukraine people do whatever they want and he preferred it that way. I know everyone is supporting and loving Ukrainians right now,  but no other country did it’s citizens hate it’s country more. Russians love their country more than ukrainans did based on my experiences.  So many ukranians wanted to leave. It will change now hopefully and they will unite.

Russia lacks optics, proper radios, and even proper guns for their Donbass units. Those items are probably even more basic than night vision equipment. That's not to say Russia isn't doing anything at night, they certainly like to launch their bombers for high altitude missile strikes and operate drones at night for artillery spotting. 

Russia' military budget isn't THAT inflated.  In some ways, it is actually very low for what they're trying to do. Keep in mind:

1. They have a huge army (that needs to be armed, fed, clothed, paid, trained, etc..)
2. They have a lot of bases that require infrastructure/maintenance. 
3. They have a lot of equipment that needs maintenance
4. They have a huge number of nuclear weapons (that are expensive to maintain. I heard someone that the USA spends more on maintaining their nuclear arsenal (smaller than Russia's) than Russia's entire military budget)
5. They have a big, expensive, submarine fleet.
6. They have a large air force.
7. They spend a lot of indigenous designs (planes, missiles, tanks, submarines, etc..)  that cost a lot to develop, which explains why Russia designs them but never seems to but many other than prototypes. 

Whole books have been written on how ridiculous Russia's defense economy is. It just doesn't make sense. It has been argued for a while by military watchers that despite all the investment, Russia' military was unsustainable unless it was funded even higher than it was. Effectively, Russia's military was ""deindustrilaizing"". Basically, rusting away in a field, going out-of-date, because it was too large, given then size of their economy, the lack of dual use technologies, etc..

A city official, Pyotr Andryuschenko, said on Saturday that Russian forces had taken “between 4,000 and 4,500 Mariupol residents forcibly across the border to Taganrog,” a city in southwestern Russia.

> 
> “I support it, practically everyone I know, my friends, all are for it,” said Yegor Gusyev, 35, who manages a vehicle parts business in the Moscow region. “I don’t know anyone who went to a protest against it.”

> “Of course it is sad – I don’t want people to die,” he said. “But there wasn’t any other choice [besides the invasion]… mistakes happen. But I also know the other side is using propaganda against us too. It is all propaganda.”
> 
> While the Russian rouble has already sunk to record lows, experts have argued it will take months before ordinary Russians feel the full force of the sanctions. “But the mood could be totally different in two, three months if the economy does actually crumple as some economists have predicted. Then Russians might start asking questions to Putin,” the sociologist said.

>Decomposition begins several minutes after death with a process called autolysis, or self-digestion. Soon after the heart stops beating, cells become deprived of oxygen, and their acidity increases as the toxic by-products of chemical reactions begin to accumulate inside them. Enzymes start to digest cell membranes and then leak out as the cells break down. This usually begins in the liver, which is rich in enzymes, and in the brain, which has high water content. Eventually, though, all other tissues and organs begin to break down in this way. Damaged blood cells begin to spill out of broken vessels and, aided by gravity, settle in the capillaries and small veins, discolouring the skin",False,1647720619.0,t3_ti333c,t1_i1bio0t,,1,36,0,36,1,0,

a994b5c0bbf89f7931139b78d9ad3f0b,ti333c,i1d50mm,"It's important to distinguish a few different things:

**(i) The Russian government's ability to pay its international creditors.**

**(ii) The Russian government's ability to provide goods and services to its citizens.**

**(iii) Short-term disruptions to the Russian economy**   
(finding replacement buyers/sellers, sourcing spare parts, shifting away from sanctioned products, price shocks due to depreciated currency, etc.).

**(iv) The long-term health of the Russian economy**   
(ability to attract and retain investment, human capital, new businesses, innovation, etc.).

There's a good chance Russia will default on at least some of its debt obligations this year due to not having enough money on hand. But it's important to realise that won't mean that they have to abandon the war in Ukraine, or that the World Bank will come to repossess their nukes. Thanks to oil and gas, they'll still have a steady influx of foreign currency to buy imports (though in limited quantities), and will still be able to pay soldiers' bills and build roads and hospitals using tax revenue and (if necessary) expanded money supply. A default will make their life harder through e.g. knock-on inflationary effects but it won't kill the economy overnight.

Likewise, although short-term disruptions to the Russian economy make for cool news stories (empty supermarket shelves) and are a giant pain in the ass for many Russian businesses (one that some will probably not survive), they too will not stop the war any time soon. Russia still has enough trade partners to import most of what it needs, and it produces enough valuable exports to pay for them. Certain goods like the very best semiconductors or aviation parts may prove a more serious challenge. Russia can still import all the consumer electronics it needs from China, and will probably figure out a way to keep its domestic planes flying, but this will certainly not help their economy.

The real thing that will fuck Russia in the long-run though is (iv), the absolute collapse in investor confidence and inability to attract human capital long-term. Few foreign investors are going to want to start new businesses in Russia any time soon or invest in Russian production, and Russia is going to be locked out of the best international financial systems for years or decades to come. The combination of Western sanctions, reputational risk, and the Russian government's own willingness to ride roughshod over norms of capital ownership create a terrible long-term climate. The same is true of human capital; if you're a smart young tech worker from India or the Philippines, why would you choose to take a job in Russia any time soon? The pay will inevitably suck thanks to the low value of the ruble, few non-Russian businesses will be operating there, and the government has done a good job of looking hostile and scary.For that matter, if you're a smart young Russian with marketable international skills, you'd probably be looking to get out of the country as soon as possible.

This may not seem a huge deal, but the ability to attract foreign investment is absolutely critical in the long-run for driving innovation, financing new infrastructure, creating a culture of entrepreneurship and growth, etc.. Russia is *horrendously fucked* in these regards, especially since it now needs to pivot away from oil and gas more quickly than it had planned, but don't expect this to collapse Putin's regime in a few months or even years.

Instead, we've basically just given Russia *economic diabetes*. As time goes by, it will get sicker and sicker and issues that would be minor health problems will loom larger than they should and compound each other, possibly killing it outright down the road. The sooner it can be put on an appropriate drug regime and implement radical lifestyle change, the better the chance it will be able to go back to living a normal life. It is to be hoped that the smart people in Russia realise that the sooner Putin goes, the sooner they can go back to eating ice-cream (metaphorically) and start reversing the massive damage that was just inflicted. However, given that a lot of the smart people just left the country, this may be a forlorn hope.",False,1647748088.0,t3_ti333c,t1_i1czfdv,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The country is on track to hit 203,000 b/d for the whole month based on current shipment schedules, according to Kpler, a commodities data and analytics firm.

> Air dominance—a far more difficult task—is achieved when opposing forces are incapable of effective interference with US operations within a given area using air and missile threats.

Yet they also criticize the US for being a great power atop the world spreading its influence outside its borders. They ignore Russia's history of aggression against all its other neighbors. More than anything else, they don't explain why it helps the world to give a hostile regional power room to grow into a global power. When it is too weak to threaten anyone outside its weaker neighbors, why should the rest of the world be stepping out of the way for it?

If the argument about balancing great powers is sound, it should work throughout history, not just the Cold War. What do they say about the Mongol expansion? Or the British Empire? Or Napoleon? Or World War 1 and 2? How do they treat Putin's personal megalomania differently than the collective rationality of the USSR inner circle or Stalin's shrewd self-preservation? North Korea is a nuclear power now, so does the world just let North Korea expand where it wants too?

It also assumes states are primarily security seeking in a zero sum context. It’s hard to make an argument that Ukraine or NATO truly threatened Russia’s security pre- war and indeed, Russia was actually doing really well dividing the west. It’s much more likely that ideologically Putin was intent on this conquest to rekindle empire and then their intel failure can be explained by bureaucratic theory. That ideological factors can’t be explained well by realism but fit well with constructivism. The West’s response blends all three paradigms-liberalism and our existing institutions helped us galvanize our response, constructivism jolted us to act on shared democratic values and realism is creating the bounds of our response— sending defensive weapons vs offensive weapons is an attempt (misguided) to calm non-existing Russian security concerns, the aggressiveness of the Baltics shows how much closer the threat is for them.",False,1647729953.0,t3_ti333c,t1_i1c1etd,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

I've been studying Russian on my own for the past two years, met a bunch of folks online and a bunch even in my area. Also lived in China for a bit, which was an eye-opener for what people who live in authoritarian countries are like.

What most people don't get is that bad governments and societal fears are symbiotic but not the same. Folks like Putin come to power because there is a lot of legitimate pain in Russia that is a spillover from literally centuries of terrible leadership. Bad people feed off of the frustration and desire for change. People shut their eyes and let themselves be deceived because their present lives are so frustrating that even a little hope is better than nothing.

So yeah, people are complicit, but they're also victims. And they have this big shared group experience that is dangerous and destructive. And they're also individuals who just want to get by and have an okay life.

Most modern conflicts take place in some kind of foreign relations post-modern ennui zone where order has already broken down and all the values and political objectives are muddled and fuzzy. The Houthis are/were a rebel group that seized power by force. Syria and Libya were messes of rebels with delegitimized governments. Even in Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a general sense that Saddam/the Taliban were not really legitimate, democratic governments and therefore nobody really cared.

A lot of this is western bias sure. You see then in a lot of African conflicts that have an even messier web of cultural, religious, and linguistic factors that westerners do not know about enough to care.

But it still is very rare for a modern, sovereign, democratic state to be invaded carte blanche by a neighbor. The modern principle is that the era of empires is over, and sovereign democratic states are free to pursue their own destinies without interference. It's a principle that a lot of people thought had ended the horrors of conventional industrialized warfare until a few weeks ago. Putin is, very brutally, challenging this principle. Ukraine was not a country that had fallen into disrepair or autocracy.

If NATO gets involved, either through an NFZ or ""peacekeeping mission"", it's about even odds. Russia just has to attack Estonia or Poland as ""punishment"" for NATO's involvement/declaration of war and then Article 5 means the US would be allowed to launch a retaliatory full nuclear strike. Putin could decide not to, I guess, but then NATO has no reason not to aggress harder against him. Even if somehow Putin doesn't attack a NATO country or Article 5 is not invoked, it still becomes a bloody mess and likely spills into Poland/Slovakia, displacing and killing even more civilians.

This war is awful, and I hope Ukraine can hold Russia at bay--but I do not think American citizens, or European citizens should be afraid of Russia right now. They have their hands full anyway.

Russia isn't going to nuke us, and China isn't going to send troops to Ukraine. Anyone telling you any different is fucking with your emotions in an effort to warp your geopolitical perspective to a nationalist one.",False,1647742628.0,t3_ti333c,t1_i1cssn9,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

They would have on the first day, when it was even more important to take out command and control and when they were even more certain they had surprise, and would also be able to recover the remains after their short invasion succeeds, because that's what they expected.

This is an act of desperation, trying to show that their decrepit army still has something up it's sleeve but it's actually indicative of their weakness. They just gave NATO and Ukraine a great chance to study this technology, including the impact site, and they didn't achieve any progress toward a strategic objective by blowing up one ammo dump.

They don't have enough of these to threaten the NATO, they don't even have enough (or the targeting/intel) to hit important targets in Ukraine.

The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations.

He goes on to say that he's experienced antisemitism by Russian neighbours and teachers, but not by the Azov Battalion.

Another Ukrainian Jew claimed there were Jews serving with the Azov Battalion:

That the US is sending aid is not surprising given the size and budget of our Military and defense industry.  Many other countries from Ireland to Germany to England and Denmark are sending aid as well, but the bulk of ammo and weapons is going to originate from the US.

Currently counter offensives are focused on Kherson and North/Northeast of Kyiv. Ukraine is struggling to hold their flank near Donetsk while Russia is redeploying forces to the area. 

If Ukraine can push back to Kherson they'll threaten the entire Russian line from Kherson to Mariupol, that is the best bet at opening up relief to the city. Russia is grinding up their offensive capabilities in order to try and take Mariupol and won't be able to capitalize on it strategically due to the cost of holding the area.  

There's not evidence it's been taken, just that it remains threatened and cut off.

Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

I am posting this because this is the first video I have seen that demonstrates the javelin arching up to then strike the tank from above.  Sorry if this is uneanted.  There is a camera in the launch tube and it is guided by infrared (heat seeking).  Also note how it arches up to strike the tank from top down which is where the tank is at its weakest.  There is no need for them to stand around and in fact it is designed for soldiers to shoot and run.  Their work is done once it is on its way.  The NLAW is lighter and instead of arcing up it apparently shoots another charge down as it passes over the tank.  It is lighter than the Javelin and apparently easier to use.

Putin is fighting over contested territory - he doesn't own it, his crazy claim to it is  part of what he is attempting to dispute in the war. In what 1890s la-la land does Putin fantasize that he can do this and get away with it? He's nuts.

Ethnic groups from the old czars' 1800s Russian empire were forcibly removed and sent to Siberia too. That's where the ""Russification"" forced assimilation idea originates.

US officials confirm Russia has used hypersonic missiles against Ukraine
From CNN's Natasha Bertrand, Jim Sciutto and Barbara Starr

US officials confirmed to CNN that Russia launched hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. The US was able to track the launches in real time, the sources said.

The launches were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities, multiple sources told CNN.

Russia's Ministry of Defence said Saturday that it had launched hypersonic Kinzhal missiles against a military ammunitions warehouse in western Ukraine on Friday, destroying the structure in the Ukrainian village of Delyatin. CNN is unable to independently verify this claim. 

Traveling at Mach 5 speed or faster, hypersonic weapons are difficult to detect, posing a challenge to missile defense systems. Hypersonic missiles can travel at a far lower trajectory than high-arcing ballistic missiles, which can be easily detectable. Hypersonics can also maneuver and evade missile defense systems.

The Pentagon has made developing hypersonic weapons one of its top priorities, particularly as China and Russia are working to develop their own versions.

From the Institute for the Study of War, Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, March 19 : ,, The ultimate fall of Mariupol is increasingly unlikely to free up enough Russian combat power to change the outcome of the initial campaign dramatically. Russian forces concentrated considerable combat power around Mariupol drawn from the 8th Combined Arms Army to the east and from the group of Russian forces in Crimea to the west. Had the Russians taken Mariupol quickly or with relatively few losses they would likely have been able to move enough combat power west toward Zaporizhiya and Dnipro to threaten those cities. The protracted siege of Mariupol is seriously weakening Russian forces on that axis, however. The confirmed death of the commander of the Russian 150th Motorized Rifle Division likely indicates the scale of the damage Ukrainian defenders are inflicting on those formations. The block-by-block fighting in Mariupol itself is costing the Russian military time, initiative, and combat power. If and when Mariupol ultimately falls the Russian forces now besieging it may not be strong enough to change the course of the campaign dramatically by attacking to the west.

Yes you are right but that wasn't the point.

The point was that if other (Europe specific) NATO countries increase their defence spending and militaries, can it free up some US forces to pivot to other places.

The simple hypothetical is yes in the long term. This doesn't mean it will happen or that US would leave Europe entirely, it just means that if European countries shoulder more of the burden in European, it COULD mean US not needing as many troops in Europe.

Short and medium term, US will have an increased presence, we know that. But long term, once this war has been sorted/etc it is ***possible*** for fewer US troops being needed in Europe.

It will free up troops but doesn't mean the US will reallocate them.

I’m of the opinion that when a totalitarian regime is being let to cross a certain line, the common folk cannot do much afterwards.

Russians had their chance to riot in 2014 when Putin illegally annexed Crimea, instead 89% of them were supporting his criminal actions. Russians had again the chance to riot on February 24, when all young people had access to outside news still, they choose not to.

Now they still can do something until Putin (whose speech becomes more and more aggressive towards “traitors”), until he’s getting the army to the streets to make virtually impossible any attempt at protesting.

In the past, in Stalins regime, tens of millions of Russians were being sent to die in gulag. History is repeating itself, yet everyone seems blind to it.

> Griner’s decision to play basketball in a country that suppresses personal freedoms is a matter of simple economics. Many WNBA stars work in other countries during the WNBA’s off-season because doing so is more lucrative than playing in the U.S. Griner is reportedly earning more than $1 million to play for her Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg.

It is damning that teams in oppressive countries such as Russia and China—another opportune marketplace for women’s basketball players—place a higher value on players such as Griner than the teams in her own country do. Sports Illustrated recently reported that the WNBA fined the New York Liberty $500,000—the highest fine that women’s professional basketball had ever imposed—for chartering flights for its players in violation of the league’s collective-bargaining agreement. The concern was that by taking chartered flights, Liberty players would be better rested and therefore have an unfair advantage over other teams.

These comparisons are not equivalents and NATO is a mutual defense treaty.

It is not a defined foreign policy alignment.

The reason that many EU and western nations back the US much of the time isn't because of defense pacts, it's because of shared values.

Iraq and Afghanistan are perfect examples. Very few nations joined for the Iraq endeavour as it was murky intel. Many did for Afghanistan because it was clearly supporting international islamic terrorism. But there are many others that also do so, certain Pakistani regions, Saudi Arabia, etc.

UK, Canada, Australia and somewhat NZ, definitely expect very close geopolitical stances from them. But Aus and NZ in particular are largely dependent on China for export economics... While this is probably true for Canada, US and UK, ANZ also have close partnerships in Asia Pacific, and these also change their geopolitical priorities.

And many EU countries rely on exports and imports to China for growth. This will have more of an impact than any US leverage due to troops.

Russia is not China, Ukraine is not Taiwan and geopolitics is a complicated thing.

And as we've seen, these powers do not wish to clash directly, fearing escalation to mutal destruction.

And irrespective of US troop concentrations in Asia, any CCP aggression so far has increased cooperation between SEA nations in the region (they've been getting aggressive with diplomacy, threats on trade and trying to expand influence). Even despite this there are fairly strong defence ties between nations such as Singapore, Malaysia and Australia.

Indonesia has been a better partner in recent decades too, and Philippines has been off/on flirting with the US for years.

Summary - many EU countries would probably support the defence of an Asian country if asked, if CCP tried something similar to attack an Asian country.

Taiwan is complicated, expect US assistance and maybe even Japanese, with an outside chance of South Korea as well.
