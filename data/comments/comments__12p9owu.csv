Speaking at a news conference with his Brazilian counterpart Mauro Vieira today, Mr Lavrov said Moscow had ""an interest"" in the conflict ending as soon as possible.

He also thanked Brazil for its ""understanding of the genesis of the situation in Ukraine"".

Russia has often repeated that any end to the conflict must acknowledge new political ""realities"" - including recognition of the four areas of Ukraine it annexed in a move deemed illegal by Kyiv the West.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,12p9owu,jglr5nd,"Parking fine for Russian plane stranded at Canadian airport nears ¬£200,000.

A Russian cargo plane that was left stranded at a Canada airport after the country closed its airspace to Russian-owned aircrafts has now amassed a parking fee of more that $330,000 (¬£198,915), the Wall Street Journal reports.

The 226ft Antonov An-124 cargo plane landed at Toronto Pearson Airport on 27 February last year - three days after Russian's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

However, Canada closed its airspace to Russian-owned planes before it could take off again and it now remains parked on the tarmac.

As it continues to amass an eye-watering parking fine, airport officials have said they want the aircraft to leave.

But aviation lawyer Bill Clark told the American newspaper that his law firm had been hired by an airline broker to help keep the plane on the ground amid fears it could be used by Russia in their fight with Ukraine.

He said: ""We're just sitting here, watching this plane rust away.""

In February last year, Canada, along with many other Western nations, prohibited the operation of Russian-owned, chartered or operated aircraft in Canadian airspace, including in the airspace above Canada's territorial waters. 

The country's transport minister Omar Alghabra said at the time: ""All of Canada is united in its outrage of President Putin's aggression against Ukraine. 

""In response, we have closed Canadian airspace to Russian owned or operated aircraft.""

It's a complete mess but what seems to have happened is that they were all forced to go to Ukraine by the orders of god-knows-who. They're not getting promised payments and those with injuries are returned to combat. They don't know where they are, which units they belong to, who are their officers, and what their next steps are.

> On the situation on the front:

> There are still two main hot spots.

> In Bakhmut - fierce street fighting continues. The enemy is very slowly being pushed out of the western part of the city. ""Wagner"" is being actively reinforced by regular army units and mobiks - the assault troops can no longer manage without them, the losses they have suffered are having an impact.

> Near Avdiivka, things are much worse. As a result of the ""meat assaults"" in recent days, the personnel of several assault companies has been ""knocked out"" (with no success whatsoever). And they weren't the worst, let's put it that way. The problems are the same as last year: the attacks are conducted without sufficient artillery preparation (and even that too inaccurate + very few shells), with almost no armored vehicles (and sometimes without any), the aviation is about as active and successful as in the Battle of Borodino in 1812.

> My forecast remains the same - Avdiivka will not be encircled (a breakthrough at Vodyanyi is necessary to encircle the city from the south) before the AFU counteroffensive. And, yes, - I am probably ""discrediting"", but for such ""meat assaults"" that have been going on following the same pattern for a year now, I would have shot the entire command staff from the army and down to the regiment level inclusive. For there is ""no cure"" for it, and the fact that this outrage has been going on for more than a year does not allow softening the punishment even to the ""penal batallion""...

From what I‚Äôve read, here‚Äôs who are not tortured‚Äî(1) military guys who were severely injured‚Äîbc they went directly to hospital and never got out.  No opportunities. This was the case for a lot of Azovstal guys, they were taken into custody on gurneys, in front of cameras.^1  Then stayed in hospital, immobile, until POW trade.   (2)  soldiers or civilians who went into custody and are visibly ‚Äòelderly‚Äô.^2  All the ones who are 60+ have said they were spared the beatings and electrical torture. (3) *Some* who are higher reputation‚Äîand the Russians know it‚Äîsay they were spared. For example, from Azovstal, two physicians, a professor and a priest-chaplain were taken captive who all say they were spared while others were not.^2  Elsewhere, some civilians arrested and later released, like village mayors have said they weren‚Äôt tortured; (4) Some civilian women who were kidnapped/detained/arrested in Kherson region have said they were not tortured.

Note: when they give their accounts, they‚Äôre calling physical beatings, electrocution, water torture, etc as ‚Äútorture.‚Äù  They‚Äôre not calling psychological torture, food deprivation, forced singing of Russian songs, rights deprivation, surgery without pain meds as torture.   They *all* suffered those things.  

____

^1 ^(not all injuries were treated equally though.  But almost all say were not given pain medicine. And the level of care was primitive and the nurses were more harsh than the doctors. Elsewhere, early in the war, guys captured were taken to Rostov and even the injured were tortured, but it was a different kind.  They make the POWs stand the entire day, like 30 guys in a small room, and a camera on them.  No leaning on wall, or removed and beaten. Sorta strange torture.  Two guys captured who had broken/shot legs‚Äîthis applied to them, too!  The other soldiers ‚Äòprotected them,‚Äô they maneuvered so these guys could lean on the others and not be seen by the cameras.)

^2 ^(Actually, these accounts differ somewhat.  For example, when the hundreds left Azovstal, they were split up and taken different places.  They then encountered different levels of treatment.  One physician and the priest say they were blindfolding en masse, made to walk down a hallway, like 40 prisoners, where the prison staff punched everyone as they walked by [walk the gauntlet], and that one of the 60+ guys got punched in the stomach, his rib cracked, punctured his lungs.  That then the guards got in trouble for ‚Äòhurting a pensioner‚Äô‚Äîhe had to be taken out to hospital.

Edit finishing comment.

This has not succeeded to raise enough new soldiers, hence the first mobilization, hence a law to allow conscripts to be deployed in ukraine (conscripts can only fight on russian soil, so russia anexed land they dont control to skip over that) and now there are fears of a second mobilization.

What has been accomplished is 1 million russians leaving the county to avoid the draft.

Leaking the counteroffensive as starting on the 30th could be to force Russia from allocating resources in Ukraine that would be otherwise used in the 9th may parades.

It could be a PR stunt to force them out of hiding and use real time intel to check for weaknesses. Once Russian forces are allocated on the field, it will be harder to move them around due to communication problems.

Having a lot of forces allocated before the 9th of may would be likely visible on the red square. Russia is trying to push a narrative that they're winning and that everything is going according to plan. But if it's true, it would be hard to explain where are the few thousands soldiers parading on the red square. Where are the modern tanks. Except the 3 T-14. I mean if Putin doesn't even show up on the parades that would be hilarious. 

That said if Ukraine succeeded in landing a UAV during the parade.. That would be very ""concerning"". If somehow anti-air get activated during the parade and shot their own plane... that would be terrible.

So yes, Lula is better than Bolsonaro in pretty much everything.

When it comes to foreign policy, he's marginally worse than Bolsonaro in certain aspects. Bolsonaro's foreign policy was only pro US when Trump was in office, after he left office he started to flirt with Putin - he did so just before Putin invaded Ukraine in fact. And had Bolsonaro won a second term he would have likely taken his political guidance from Trump and his political advisor Steve Bannon.

Lula's foreign policy is driven by a genuine distrust of US foreign policy - some of it is deserved, a lot of it is simply stupid though -. Like it or not when it comes to the issue of Ukraine, he'll position Brazil as a passive ally of Russia - Brazil will criticize Russia in ways that make absolutely no difference, meaningless UN general assembly votes for instance, but when it comes to actual policies, Brazil will adopt a passive partnership with Russia, more or less advocating for some of the narratives being pushed by Russia and their ally China, but with careful consideration to avoid potential blowbacks from the US.",1681746551.0,1681744583.0,t3_12p9owu,t1_jgm3ij9,,3,11,0,11,0,0,
