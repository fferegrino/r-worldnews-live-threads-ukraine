Day 41 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Almost the whole night was pretty loud. Apparently some jets flew not that far away from our city, air raid alerts were constant, we saw AA defenses shooting at something, there were constant flashes in the sky, but we didn’t see what they were shooting at.

The sound of explosions in the morning was also almost constant, most likely it came from Derhachi, since today they said that due to constant shelling, Derhachi was left without electricity and its citizens are advised to leave for a safer place.

Most of the day it was quiet, and only recently it became noisy. From our observations active combat along with shelling usually starts around 8-9 pm and continues until 1-4 am. For example, just now it was reported that our AA defenses are shooting at something again, even though there’s no active air raid alert in Kharkiv right now.

When I teach genocide I start by saying that this definition has huge problems because it doesn't give us clear thresholds (what ""in part"" does even mean?) and because it is almost impossible to prove intent.

Second, more evidence that Bucha is not an exception. Each massacre might be local initiative, together they are a campaign.

>**Volyn Oblast** - 60% of Belarusian military officers and troops are against joining the war and have said that they will immediately join Ukraine's side if they're forced to march and they think the risk of joining is very low.

>**Chernihiv and Sumy Oblasts** - Russian troops got BTFO mostly by Territorial Defence and began their retreat before it was even announced. Some artillery remains but they're getting eliminated by Spetsnaz.

>**Kharkiv** (Oblast) - Heavy fighting and artillery. Russians desperately need it, but they have no chance of taking the city. They're trying to attack from the south-west of Izium, but there's a pause cause Russians pretty much threw everything they had at taking Izium.

>**Lugansk Oblast** - Ukraine is holding 25% of the territory. Lots of heroic fighting - Ukrainians are even staging counter-attacks.

>**Donetsk Oblast/Mariupol** - Russians are trying to surround it from the south, but are encountering difficulties. Street fights happening in Mariupol, but Russian advanced has stopped too. Apparently Arestovych has family fighting there and he's very intimate with what's going on there.

>**Southern Ukraine (Kherson, Zaporizhzhia)** - Ukrainians are active in Zaporizhzhia and are preventing troops from getting moved to Mariupol. Kherson - Russians are on the defensive. Ukrainians are slowly moving in, but are encountering difficulties to due all the canals in the area. Russians are seriously considering abandoning Kherson city itself.

>**Odesa Oblast** - He doesn't believe Russia will try to take it and that Russian troop movements in Transnistria are there to keep Ukrainians from moving their troops away from Odesa. I think he's implying that if it wasn't for European countries Ukraine would've invaded Transnistria to deal with it.

That's more or less it for the actual territories. On top of that, he believes that the west will supply heavy weaponry due to Bucha and that massacres like Bucha are happening all over the country.

**Future of the war:**

Russia has no more strength to continue the war. Russia has 10 land armies, 8 of them were deployed to Ukraine at the start of the war, now it's all 10. The 5th army (5th Combined Arms Army?) is moving all the way from the Russian Far East. After this they have nothing else.

Russia is trying to summon 60000 reservists, but he doesn't think anything will come out of it because Russia doesn't have enough equipment.

Putin's main goal atm is to capture Mariupol and surround JFO, but he doesn't think they can take it until Victory Day. If that fails, Putin will start a purge against generals to shift the blame.

He doesn't believe that Russia will use tactical nukes. The rest is boring stuff about negotations.",False,1649185919.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,103,0,103,0,0,

April 5, 2022

The 64th Motorized Rifle Brigade of the 35th All-Russian Army, whose servicemen massacred and tortured civilians in Bucha, will be returned to Ukraine. The Russian command will not rotate the personnel in this unit and will throw it back to the front.

As of April 4, the brigade had been withdrawn from Ukraine to Belarus and was near the town of Mozyr. By April 6, the personnel will be transported by rail to Belgorod, Russia. After only a two-day vacation, they plan to return to Ukraine in one of the ""hottest"" places (approximately - Kharkiv direction). As a rule, Russian units leaving the combat zone receive much more time for recovery and rest.

Such a schedule indicates that ""special tasks"" are expected for the 64th Brigade. The first of them: intimidation of inhabitants of settlements of Ukraine. Those who committed the crimes of genocide in Bucha may repeat this again in other cities.

Another goal of the rapid return of the 64th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid ""disposal"" of unnecessary witnesses. That is, redeployment to a section of the front where they will have no chance of surviving to make it impossible to testify in future courts.

The personnel of the unit, aware of the resonance of the events in Bucha and the responsibility for the crimes committed, massively opposes the return to Ukraine. However, the Russian command ignores these sentiments and threatens the tribunal if it refuses to continue fighting. Release reports are not accepted.

Currently, Ukrainian and international investigators are documenting numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the Russian military. And no criminal occupier will escape proper punishment.""

We met Mykola. He and his wife spent a month living in the cellar of his apartment building. When the Russians arrived, they killed all the men below 50. He’s 53. He told us this shaking with the trauma of it. They gave him 20 minutes to bury his friends.

Three graves sit just opposite his apartment block. Each marked with a wooden plank and a religious icon attached. He wanted to give them whatever dignity he could. ‘But it’s too shallow,’ he says, almost apologetically. ‘I just wanted to protect them from the dogs.’

Two of them were shot in front of him. Another had a grenade thrown at him. His body parts sat on the ground for days, until at last he was allowed to gather them, put them in a bag, and bury them. One of these graves is smaller than the others.

Russians asked for documentation when they got there. Anything in your papers that made them think you were a threat, and you were dead. He said they made the men strip off, looking for tattoos. Perhaps military tattoos.

We went to the mass grave satellite images have seen near the church. We saw bags of bodies dumped on top of other victims who were either wrapped in sheets or nothing at all. Brave locals went out to collect the dead from the street during the occupation. We were told there could be as many as 90 people in these graves.

**Summary of the 5/4/22 Meeting - not my opinion - not my opinion - every mistake is mine.**

**Zelensky**

Yesterday I returned from our city of Bucha, liberated recently. There was not a single crime the Russians did not commit. They shot entire families, adults & children, and they tried to kill the bodies, civilians.

I am calling on the memories of everyone killed: some died in the streets, other in the wells, others tortured, others crashed by tanks - for their pleasure.

They cut their throats, tongues pulled out. Women were raped.

This is not different from other terrorists, and here this is done by a member of the UN. They inflammed a War and led a War as to kill and displace as many civilians as possible. massgraves - you have seen them. You have seen their propaganda, their corruption.

**They are creating a global food crisis**

**Where is the security that the UN security council needs to guarantee? I see a Council but no guarantee.**

Now the World can see what they did in Bucha, but the World has yet to see what they have done in other parts of my country.

I would like to remind you of the Charter I - what is the purpose of the UN? The purpose is to maintain peace, and that has been violated. We see the war crimes - Russian troops are destroying Russian cities, blocking refugees, shooting them, creating famine and blowing up shelters. They are creating situations, in which as many civilians as possible are killed.

This is only one situation which you are seeing, and the full world will see the other crimes. You know, I know perfectly well what the Russian Ambassador will say. The same what they said once they shot down the Malaysian Airline over Donbass -

They will blame everyone to justify their own actions, but it is 2022 now. We have satellite images, we will conduct transparent investigations. Journalists and the International Criminal Court and everyone will have full access.

To punish those responsible. To show every other war criminal in this world that they will be punished.

Russia came because they are colonizers and want our wealth, and our citizens. They are looting openly, they are kidnapping our citizens to their country.

**The UN can simply be closed if nothing is done. If you think that the time for international law is not gone, then you must act immediately. The aggressor must be brought to heels immediately; same with Yemen, Syria. These crises should have been stopped long time ago.** The world would have changed for sure, and then there might not have been war in my country. But the world watched and did not want to see what was happening, how Russia was also preparing to attack other countries.

Anyone who has given criminal orders will be brought before the Tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg Tribunal. **I would like to remind the Russian Ambassador that Ribbbentrop and Eichman also did not escape punishment.**

I would like to suggest a global conference to discuss - we must do everything in our power to pass to the next generation an effective UN. There can't be no more exceptions because of  economic or geographic privileges. Ukraine is ready to provide the infrastructure, such as an office. I would like to remind you that we evacuated more than 1000 people of Afghanistan - it was a difficult time and we came to their help. We did not look as to who needed their help. We saved them everyone. If everyone in the world was confident that help would come if needed, it would be a safer world. We have the moral duty to propose this.

# You have two different options:

# - Remove Russia (since they are the Aggressor).

# - Please show how we can change the UN, e.g. resolve yourself & work for Peace.

# Or just admit that you can nothing to do except conversation.

# Please watch this short video -  of how one country violates rights if it goes unpunished.

Thank you very much.

The history of WWII is also a war on memories, which differ on the perspective and country.

Stalin a modern-day hero in Russia, because Putin considers him a hero.

Eastern European history is extremely complex. Nation building in Eastern Europe does sometimes include controversial figures that for one nation are heroes, but for the neighbouring nation are enemies that killed their people. State borders have changed repeatedly so you have people of the same ethnicity/cultural connections living across state lines, mixed in and interspersed.

The user was asking what is it like in most parts of ukraine. 

Everytings pretty normal except 

1)  big cities have curfews

2) Restricted alcohol sales (depends on the city)

3) There are air raids and bombings every night depending on where you are, and people sleeping underground. (ETA: not everyone sleeps underground either. Even in kyiv many people just stayed in their homes. Takes balls imho.) Nearly everywhere someone has heard or seen some part of the war. Whether its their family being shipped off, or they saw or heard a missile or plane fly over their head. Or heard the air raid sirens. Or made sand bags.

4) People are volunteering in all kinds of things and training in territorial defense funds, taking up delivery of medicines (Ukraine is short on a lot of them, please consider donating to legitimate orgs for delivery of things like insulin, hemostatic bandages, tourniquets etc), logistics support in general (delivering and inventory of supplies for the war effort etc)

5) Obviously there is no tourism anymore

6) There are checkpoints in many places now

7) Men are either at the front or fighting for the right to be at the front or if they're too old, taking part of territorial defense somehow (people are very motivated.) 

Other than that work is work and play is play. During the day things are surprisingly normal. This is what I hear from my colleagues in Ukraine, in various parts. I won't say where and who they are for security reasons.

ETA: some other things I might add. 

- OFC people are getting emotional about it but Ukrainians are pretty tough and tend not to show feelings on the surface. There's been a lot of sharing of emotional/patriotic/ass-kicking ukrainian music with me of late. 

- Suddenly everyone I know is discussing weapons in a way that makes my american 2nd-amendment-loving ass proud. I've seen some ""collections"" of late. People are gathering them to be prepared for everything. TBH I've learned a lot of my Ukrainian friends had always loved shooting they just never talked about it.

> Archpriest Piotr Pavlenko had just finished saying prayers over the body of one of Hostomel’s fallen and returned to his church when the townspeople burst in to tell him his friend Yriy was dead.

> Yriy Pzylyko, the mayor, had been delivering food and medicines to civilians stranded by fighting when their humanitarian convoy came under fire from Russian snipers hidden in a multi-storey building.
> 
> When Pavlenko went to face down the soldiers to retrieve Pzylyko’s body, they took in his vestments and cross with something close to shame. “Don’t touch the body or it will explode and you’ll blow up with it,” a soldier shouted. Pavlenko shrank back.

Russia’s ambassador to Denmark was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Copenhagen, where the government relayed its ""strong condemnation of Russia's brutality against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha"" and ""emphasized that deliberate attacks against civilians are a war crime,"" it said. They have been given 14 days to leave the country.

The Russian Embassy in Denmark responded by saying ""no evidence"" was offered to the ambassador to prove the diplomats were spies.

""All employees of Russian foreign institutions in Denmark strictly follow the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in their activities,"" the Russian Embassy said in a statement. 

""This step of the Danish side has no grounds and is aimed at further destruction of relations between our countries. It is not going to remain unanswered.""

Denmark’s move follows the expulsion of Russian intelligence officers from several other European countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands in response to the war in Ukraine. 

However, Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said in parliament that Denmark does not want to break diplomatic relations with Moscow and clarified that the expulsion does not include the Russian ambassador or the rest of the embassy staff in Copenhagen. 

""It is only a matter of expelling intelligence officers,"" he said in response to dramatic changes in the European security picture in recent weeks. 

With this decision, we are sending a clear signal to Moscow that we will not accept Russian intelligence officers spying on Danish soil. They pose a risk to our national security that we cannot ignore.""",False,1649158273.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

The Act, which Russia signed, specifically contemplated a mechanism to add new NATO members where Russia was given consultative but not veto power over. In exchange, NATO promised not to permanently station troops or nukes in new NATO states, which it has upheld, and is part of why the US deliberately has a light footprint on Russia's borders. 

Furthermore, the Act was signed in May of 1997. President Clinton had called for former Warsaw Pact members to be admitted to NATO in 1996. Russia had to have known this was the plan when they signed this Act, but did so anyways, in part because there _were_ security assurances in the Act that ensured that the security of the Russian state wasn't going to be threatened. Subsequently, after new states were admitted to NATO months after the Act was signed, Russia joined the NATO-Russia council in 2002, which holds annual meetings that they've regularly attended. It is hard to imagine that the Russians would have done any of this if they wished to reserve protest against NATO expansion until the present day.

Finally, this war has shown, perhaps for some in frustrating detail, that the security of the Russian state is guaranteed by virtue of their nuclear capabilities. If this were Serbia invading its neighbors again like the Yugoslav wars and allegedly committing war crimes on par with what we saw in Bucha, it is hard to imagine NATO not taking aggressive action, especially after seeing how much the invading army has been struggling over the past few weeks. Instead, Russia has the largest arsenal of nukes in the world, and regardless of whether you think half or more of them will fail, it only takes one mushroom cloud over a major Western city for the costs to be unacceptably high for intervention. The war's long term consequences beyond Eastern Europe will likely be a heavy blow to non-proliferation, because it's crystal clear from this conflict that joining the nuclear club is _the_ most surefire way to ensure the survival of a government or regime.",False,1649177208.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

The US Treasury Department on Tuesday sanctioned what it called Russia’s “most prominent” dark web market, a place where cybercriminals sold hacking tools and where millions of dollars in ransomware payments changed hands. 

The sanctions coincided with a move by German police to shut down the computer servers of Hydra, as the dark web market is known, and seize $25 million in cryptocurrency.  

Since emerging in 2015, the Hydra dark web market — an internet-based network accessible through specialized software — has been a haven for illicit commerce, according to researchers and US officials. Over $5 billion in bitcoin transactions have taken place on Hydra, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency. 

That includes about $8 million in ransom payments made to hackers that have deployed three prominent strains of ransomware in attacks on US companies.  

“The global threat of cybercrime and ransomware that originates in Russia, and the ability of criminal leaders to operate there with impunity, is deeply concerning to the United States,” Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement. 

After a spate of ransomware attacks on US critical infrastructure last year, the Biden administration has looked to choke off sources of funding for cybercriminal gangs. The Treasury Department in September sanctioned Suex, a cryptocurrency exchange that US officials accused of doing business with hackers behind eight types of ransomware.",False,1649186721.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

> The move is designed to force Russia into choosing among three unappealing options -- draining dollar reserves held in its own country, spending new revenue, or going into default, said a spokesperson for the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control who discussed details of the decision on condition of anonymity.
> 
> The change comes as a payment on the country’s sovereign debt was due Monday and is intended to further ratchet up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine. It follows accusations over the weekend that Russian troops massacred civilians in Bucha and other Ukrainian towns.

> 
> The humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union, the video says, was the result of efforts by the United States to destroy its legitimacy. With swelling music and sunny scenes of present-day Moscow, the documentary praises Mr. Putin for restoring Stalin’s standing as a great wartime leader and for renewing patriotic pride in Russia’s past.
> 
> To the world, China casts itself as a principled onlooker of the war in Ukraine, not picking sides, simply seeking peace. At home, though, the Chinese Communist Party is pushing a campaign that paints Russia as a long-suffering victim rather than an aggressor and defends China’s strong ties with Moscow as vital.
> 
> Chinese universities have organized classes to give students a “correct understanding” of the war, often highlighting Russia’s grievances with the West. Party newspapers have run series of commentaries blaming the United States for the conflict.
> 
> Around the country, the Communist Party has organized sessions for officials to watch and discuss the history documentary. The 101 minute-long video, which was completed last year, does not mention the war in Ukraine but argues that Russia is right to worry about neighbors that broke away from the Soviet Union. It describes Mr. Putin as cleansing Russia of the political toxins that killed the Soviet Union.
> 
> “The most powerful weapon possessed by the West is, aside from nuclear weapons, the methods they use in ideological struggle,” says the documentary’s stern-voiced narrator, citing a Russian scholar. The documentary was marked for internal viewing — that is, for audiences chosen by party officials and not for general public release — but the video and script have recently surfaced online in China.

**Under-secretary General**

\- outlines situation in Ukraine

\- horrifying images emerged from Bucha, including images from massgraves. We also heard from rapes, and mass executions.

\- negotiations have continued at the same time.

\- There has been a reported decrese of groups from Kyiv - such a move should not be tactical. We urge Russia to withdraw completely.

\- All nuclear sites in Ukraine must be fully secured and military actions need to be avoided.

\-We have received credible allegations that Russia has used cluster ammunition at least 24 times in Civilian areas. This would amount to war crimes. Similar allegations re. Ukraine are also investigated.

\- We are concerned about the situation of the vulnerable, attack on hospitals & arrest of civilians. We call for the immediate release of everyone who has been detained, including reporters, mayors ...

\- We have heard allegations of sexual violence, including gang rape and rape in front of children - we are verifying all allegations.

\- We are concerned about the videos of poisoner abuse on both sides and remind both sides to stick to the humanitarian convention.

\-We are heartened by neighbouring countries & other Ukrainians who are hosting refugees. More than 10 mil displaced and we are very concerned about reports of human trafficking.

\- If the war continues, Ukraine would lose 18 years of economic progress.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,twkwe0,i3hwc1o,"Putin: Russian fuel and seeds supplies need to be regulated

Certain supplies, including fuel and seeds, should be regulated by the government, President Vladimir Putin warned Russia in a televised address. But he blamed it on global shortages of food and not on western sanctions against Russia. 

“It is clear that this year, against the backdrop of a global food shortage, we will have to be more prudent in our food supplies abroad, namely, to monitor carefully the parameters of such exports to countries that are clearly hostile towards us,” Putin said in a televised address at the agricultural industry meeting.

Putin said the manure market is already regulated by the government, and it is necessary to control the supply of fuels, seeds and pedigree stock to the country.

“In conditions of external restrictions, a most important issue is the availability of modern equipment and repair parts,” he added.

Western sanctions against Russia were laid because of “mistakes in the economic, energy, and food policies” of developed countries, which led to higher prices and lack of food supplies, Putin claimed.

“Against the background of minimal food supplies in the world, new sanctions are being imposed, the work of enterprises and logistics of fertilizer supplies from Russia and Belarus are being blocked, and our own fertilizer production in the West is falling due to high natural gas prices, which is also, in fact, the result of the activities of our partners in the West,” he said.

“In these current conditions, a shortage of fertilizers on the global market is inevitable,” he said, adding, “Not all countries will be able to buy the necessary amount of fertilizers for the current season, which means that crop yields will also decrease.”

Despite all of these negative factors, Putin claimed Russia has “food self-sufficiency.”

“For the main food groups, our domestic market is fully provided with its own food, its own production, and for some goods, such as sunflower oil, grain, the capacities of domestic enterprises cover the demand in excess and very good export potential for Russia has emerged,” he said",False,1649170300.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

*Efforts by Russian forces advancing from Izyum to capture Slovyansk will likely prove to be the next pivotal battle of the war in Ukraine. Russian forces likely intend to cut off Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine and will need to take Slovyansk as their minimum step to do so. If Russian forces take Slovyansk, they will then have the option to advance directly east to link up with Russian forces fighting in Rubizhne—a shorter drive that will not isolate many Ukrainian forces—or advance toward Horlivka and Donetsk to attempt a wider encirclement of Ukrainian forces. Both options could enable at least limited Russian breakthroughs in Luhansk Oblast. If Russian forces are unable to take Slovyansk at all, Russian frontal assaults in Donbas are unlikely to independently breakthrough Ukrainian defenses and Russia’s campaign to capture the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts will likely fail.*

Putin's dream of being a corrupt dictator surrounded by qualified people is unrealistic. The leadership of the Russian army is just as corrupt as Putin and United Russia because in a corrupt society everyone thinks: ""If the other guy got to a a high position through political manoeuvres and bribes why can't I!"" instead of  ""the person who does a good job needs to get promoted so I must do a good job to get promoted!"".

The Russian campaign looks like a campaign designed by people who are not qualified for their jobs and this is exactly why it isn't. Most of the Russian so called generals got their jobs through political connections and expected to spend their entire life until retirement doing nothing but collecting medals for doing military drills in Russia. They never imagined they would actually be in an actual war against a slightly prepared foe.

Which is ultimately why the Chinese army is a lot more corrupt and inefficient than people believe it to be.

The road between Kyiv and the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has reopened, the Chernihiv regional military governor said Tuesday. 

""Yesterday we resumed the route [between Chernihiv and Kyiv], thanks to the Operational Command North, to the military. There is a direct connection between Kyiv and Chernihiv now. We will open a few more routes, as the traffic is very high,"" said Viacheslav Chaus, head of the Chernihiv regional administration, in remarks on national television.

Russia's military announced a pullback from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions following a meeting last week between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Istanbul.

""Chernihiv and especially the villages around Chernihiv need humanitarian aid,"" Chaus said. ""People are free to leave. We have not set restrictions on entry yet, but I have asked residents of the region and Chernihiv itself not to hurry to come back, because Chernihiv is limited in resources — electrical cables are damaged, there is no water supply. There is no need to come back home now. Let us put things in order in the city, in the cities nearby, and then it will be time to come back.""

The discovery of murdered civilians in areas retaken by the Ukrainian military from the Russians has sparked outcry, particularly after evidence came to light of a massacre in the Kyiv suburb in Bucha. Chaus warned that evidence of possible war crimes would surface in the Chernihiv region.

""A lot of settlements were destroyed in our region. Mostly these are settlements near the city of Chernihiv, where the enemy lived in our houses, and our people were in basements, they were tortured and killed,"" he said. ""These are in the settlements of Nizhyn and Pryluky districts, the situation there is also critical."" 

Chaus added, ""many innocent children were killed. [There were] moral, psychological traumas … The day before yesterday, I was in Yahidne, a village 10 to 15 kilometers (six to nine miles) from Chernihiv. People sat in basements there, they were rarely let out. The children wrote the words of the anthem of Ukraine on the walls at night there … It's awful.""",False,1649171781.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

*The Ukrainian War - one of the UN member states, in violation of the UN's charter, is invading Ukraine. Never forget the images of the civilians killed in Bucha. We are calling for an independent investigation. Allegations of sexual assault is also emerging. Also, X million people have fled - the massive mass immigration since WWII. This has also led to an increase of energy, food etc - since Ukraine & Russia are the main suppliers of these. This is having a serious impact on the economy of developing countries.*

*That's why the guns must be silent*

*I have asked the emergency coordinator to travel to Russia.* 

*It's my serious duty to call your attention on the damage being done to the global economy and the damage that will be done to developing countries which are vulnerable to increasing food prices. Wheat prizes increased by 21%, ....*

*We have seen several countries move from developping into crisis.* 

*We are urging every country to keep their markets open and give food to those countries in hunger. This is not the time for protectionism. Not the time for strategic stockpiling. The only solution on-going is the deployment of green energy.*

*Financial country must go into emergency mode, ensuring liquidity.*

*- Russian Ambassador thanks everyone, including Zelensky & the Guy who travelled to Russia to broker a peace treaty.*

*- Every peace agreement we have reached is not implemented by Ukraine. I won't bore you with figure. But for example, we have managed to evacuate over XX? people to Russia. We are not talking about coercion or kidnapping, but as shown by many video's, accessible on Social Media, this was out of their free will.* ***\[doesn't show evidence\]***

*- to Zelensky, we place on your conscience the unfunded allegations against the Russian military. Vlodimyr, we remembered when in 2019 you were elected president. You pledged peace, including in the Donbass. We were on the verge of the correction of history. However, now you called them a ""subspecies"", same as your predecessor who said that the citizens there ""should rot in their basements"". You declared war against Russian language.*

*- Today, artillery rounds are exploding all over Ukraine, and they are exploding because there was no other way of bringing peace to the Donbass, because you didn't follow the Minsk Agreement.*

*- There are Nazi collaborators running the show in Ukraine - responsible for the killing of innocent poles, jews (?).. You pretend not to know them, but they are there. How do we know this? Well, they have tattoos (?). They exchange greetings and are open on this on social media. They are killing civilians, use them as shields.*

*- We heard lies about the Russian military. We have 100-1000 testimonies of people who are willing to provide testimony about the cruelty of Ukrainians. A grandmother told her that she wasn't allowed to leave the basement. .... People were kicked out of their houses and the houses were used to fire mortar rounds. One woman says that she was tortured and raped by Ukrainians when they found out that she was Russian origin. An Ukrainian tank drove around & fired at civilians.*

*And people were tortured & killed, with Swastikas burned into their chests.... despite all common sense, you try to lay the blame at our door - that's unconceivable .*

\- *N****ow it turns out that we shouldn't have withdrawn from Bucha. You have seen the photos, but have you noted the inconsistencies? The bodies were not there when we withdrew.*** *Those people on the ground have white armbands (civilians)* \- couldn't catch this

*-* ***The other states don't give a hoot about Ukraine, but they will prolong the weapons to Ukraine. How have we sank to such cruelty?***

***We came to Ukraine to bring peace to the blood-soaked lands of Donbass - not a truce, but a long-lasting peace. For that we need to remove the Nazi tumor. We are not shooting civilians, that's why we are not advancing as fast as expected. We are not like the Americans in the US.

I’m of two minds. If this is still the piecemeal every general for himself win by May 9th effort it has been so far, Hertling is probably right. It’s likely everyone has different ideas on how to win the war and we see multiple offenses with no real support happening. Brutality and war crimes vary to the taste of local commanders.

If the rumors of Putin finally nominating a theater commander is accurate, it’s likely Kofman is right. That’s the smart plan. Try to crack open the Ukrainian defenses with artillery and bombs, and send semi regular attacks forward to try and take advantage.

The Srebrenica genocide saw over 8000 indigenous European Slavic Muslims(Bosniaks) murdered by the Bosnian Serb army, Serb army, Serbian paramilitary, Greek and Russian volunteers. More than 8000 civilian men and boys were brutally and systematically executed during the course of 3 days. That is an achievement in and of itself. In places like Prijedor, Vlasenica, Visegrad, Foca, Bijeljina and so forth, genocide also took place by any parameters.

The infamous white Z symbol that Russian forces use on their vehicles are a textbook play from the Bosnian Serbs who painted every Serb-owned house in certain colors, to mark that those properties would be spared from destruction or to be owned by incoming Serb families in the future.

Systematic killings and rape of civilians were the norm for Bosnian Serb soldiers and paramilitary during the Bosnian war. The images we saw from Bucha a few days ago could easily have been taken in Bijeljina in 1992 after Arkan's paramilitary indiscriminately killed non-Serb civilians on the streets of that town, bordering Serbia to its north. Of course the war would get many times uglier throughout its course, culminating in the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. I hope history does not repeat itself in Ukraine. It seems headed in that direction, considering the footage we got from Bucha. However Bosnia was under a weapons embargo during the war, Ukraine is not. Equipment can flow in via bordering NATO nations. Bosniaks had the displeasure of being one of the few ethnically European population groups that happen to be muslim, which realistically impacted the level of neglect seen from the rest of Europe at the time. Also, today we have social media, instant uploads, camera phones, and most of the world knows what Putin and Russia are capable of. We will not see the scale of systematic civilian killings, rape camps, torture camps to the level of Bosnia, but what we are seeing are indiscriminate shellings targeting civilians in a less direct, but as lethal manner. Bucha definitely brings chills down my spine because those pictures could easily have been taken in early 92 and the first killing sprees by Bosnian Serb soldiers.",1649202626.0,1649202476.0,t3_twkwe0,t3_twkwe0,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

1. The Crimea axis of attack is closed for good. Russia is never taking Kherson back. Out of the three main axis of attacks: Kyiv, Crimea and Donbas only Donbas remains active. 
2. Ukraine now is free to make preparations to take back Crimea by military forces since Kherson sits directly on top of Crimea. Depending on what capabilities they posses Ukraine can now probably strike ships in Crimean harbours. 
3. Ukraine is now free to move to Mariupol from the south and then move further into the Donetsk Oblast also from the South. Basically Ukraine can launch a two front attack on Donbas instead of exclusively through the East.

What does this say about Russian military 

1. It is now focused exclusively on just holding on to Crimea+ Donetsk and Lugansk.1. Russia has given up on any region besides the ones in which a Russian population resides. This would explain the recent articles in Russian media targeting Ukrainians as an ethicity.

I did some napkin logic a few times and came to the following most likely outcome:

1. Ukraine mops up the NE, then

2. Any attempt on Mariupol or Kherson would most likely be precedeed by a push South towards Melitopol.

This is based on the basic main supply routes from a map read. Access to Mariupol from the North is possible but very close to separatist region, so likely would be under strain and unreliable as an avenue. The alternative option is via Melitopol/Berdiansk, which is a long and costly endeavour.

The siege at Mariupol isn't likely to be relieved any time soon and to get to it or to make a move on Kherson will take time if Melitopol needs to be captured first. Even then, the priority may be to liberate Kherson first to free up forces from the West.

Otherwise it is entirely legal for them to hire actors and write entity fabricated scripts, as well as it is legal for companies or organizations to pay them to fabricate stories for them so they can profit off of the results.

Most of us have forgotten that it's all literally scripted, and for a long time news reporters have merely been pretty faces reading script from a teleprompter.

After a month of being randomly mushified by Bayraktar strikes though something clearly snapped and Russian officers just started ordering retaliatory violence against the civilian population. 

Part of this is that a lot of local Ukrainian forces are acting as guerillas behind the lines. This isn't being reported enough, I think. I read an article on BBC just now where one guy casually mentioned texting information about Russian troop positions to a relative in the army. The Russians know this kind of thing is happening, result being they are barging into homes randomly and demanding to look at phones. 

Over time this makes everybody hate each other more, but things have definitely been escalating as this drags on. 

It doesn't help that everywhere the media goes in Kyiv Oblast now they keep finding piles and piles of empty liquor bottles wherever the Russians are. It sounds like a stereotype but these kids all being drunk morons is a recurring theme I keep noticing. I think anybody who's ever been to a bar knows alcohol just kind turns people into pure id. Somebody says something to you, you immediately respond with ""fuck off"" and/or punch. But now you have a gun. And your friends are dead.  And you've been living in a bombed out shithole, unwashed, with 30 other guys, shitting in a bucket. 

Another thing here, the Russian leadership obviously has no control whatsoever over its troops. If it tells them to go somewhere they'll go, but troops getting wasted, raping women, looting, randomly killing people, that's the sign there's no discipline or accountability happening here. There's a reason soldiers live under a far more strict legal regime all over the world, because war brings out the worst in people and if it isn't repressed then it grows out of control. Doesn't seem like that's happening here.

One, well placed allied tank ambushing an enemy convoy can kill an entire convoy of tanks. 40+ anti-tank shells are inside of each tank, you repeatedly can shoot and kill many, many enemies with that platform.

-------

Tanks aren't a ""video game tank"". You don't sit there and take fire and hope your armor holds up. The main purpose of the modern day tank is the 120mm gun shooting 50lbs of explosives every 6 seconds. 5 well placed shots over 30 seconds can kill 5 enemy tanks.

As a lot of combat manuals state: the ultimate anti-tank weapon is a tank of your own.

Much like how soldiers can hide behind trees and lie prone behind cover, tanks too can lie inside of a defilade in ""hull down"" position (hull behind the hill in front of you, but your turret ""just above"" the hill). Enemy shells at your hull will be deflected by the mound-of-dirt in front of you (maybe not enough to prevent the shot entirely, but enough to slow down the enemy rounds so that your armor can ignore the remnants of the enemy's momentum)

Russian in Kherson are holding the city by controlling two villages and the airport. The airport has cost them dearly.

Kherson airport was shelled by UA 12+ times. In one instance Russians lost some 50 tanks/ifv/trucks.., second time they lost a metric ton of fuel, supply trucks.. third time a bunch of soldiers, fourth time they lost a whole helicopter fleet some 40 helicopters stationed there were destroyed, multiple air defences destroyed etc..

Russia ain’t taking Odessa. It’s unlikely they will get to keep Kherson we will now see redeployment’s for next 2 weeks. Then we will see how Ukraine decides to take Kherson by force or by diplomacy.

* The canal is in Nova Kakhovka, which is upstream from Kherson and on the Eastern bank of the Dnieper. Russia certainly has no reason to give that city up, but it's not that close to Kherson.

* Odesa is probably much later in the war if Russia is still targeting it. They seem to acknowledge that they've bitten off more than they can chew at this point and want to focus on the East for now. If they've managed to take the Donbas and Kharkiv, I think that's when they'd consider moving back to retake Kherson and possibly launch a successful attack on Mykolaiv to pave the way to take Odesa.

Right now, Ukraine remains very much on the defensive against Russian air power. They are making good use of their preexisting stock of fighter jets, but are running low on parts & replacements. Their stingers and MANPADS have definitely kept Russian air power from dealing decisive blows, but every long-distance attack has the potential to kill Ukrainian forces. Russia retains a vast arsenal of air power that can attack out of range from a greater distance than the stingers can reach. There is no cure all panacea for fighting an underdog defensive war. However, there are weapons that better balance the playing field.

Edit: Washington Post has pointed out (1) Ukraine is asking for Soviet weapons systems it has experience with, (2) the *real reason* for rejection by USA was fear of escalation with Russia, not disdain for Ukrainian inexperience, and (3) I personally think after Bucha that we need to escalate.

I did care about Syria and Iraq and Yemen, but truth be told and as horrible as that truth is, due to history (yes, colonialism too) and military interventions and religious clashes both between different religions AND between the different factions of the same religion (the sunni and shia), plenty of Middle-East and MENA is just a mess. The West gets told that it screwed up and should clean it up, so if there are genuine attempts, we're again interfering; but if we don't interfere, that's bad too. And there isn't even a clear injured party always present. What makes Ukraine easier to support for the wider public in the West is that we know there is clear aggressor and the state that is being attacked. But in many of world's conflicts, the distinction isn't there, or the conflict is entirely internal. People call us out about the Rohingya, the muslim minority in China etc. but realistically the world cannot invade Myanmar or China to stop them. 

The harsh reality is that had Hitler not started WWII, but contained his actions to within Germany, chances are that European powers would not have gotten involved at all. This is a harsh truth, but probably truth nonetheless. 

International law exists because countries uphold it and follow it, in general terms. But there is no world police that can decide that a country should be attacked because it has gone against its own citizens or against people within its borders and most countries in the world do not get involved in another country's business. 

The other harsh truth is that Russia is a nuclear power state and has the potential to blow the world up several times over, whereas the same is not true for many of the countries where conflicts take place.

They don't have the manpower to occupy it, but they have it thoroughly defended.  It literally can't be taken by Ukraine, and probably not even if NATO showed up and made a go of it.  They are completely entrenched, have been repelling Ukrainian test skirmishes, and all they need to do is sit there and meet their resupply.  

People have this impression that Kherson was under siege or something but that's not the case.  It's been perfectly out of reach for Ukraine.  So if this is true that they're going to leave it, it must be because they want the 4 btgs and 1 division they have there doing something else.  

Frankly I think this might end up being erroneous information on Ukraine's part.  I don't know what objective is more important to Russia than Kherson.  They want water for Crimea; they need Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts.  And they'll free up about 10,000 troops once Mariupol falls so are they losing that badly in the southern front that they need to give up Kherson's encirclement?

Yes, people won't starve. Majority of our population have lived in USSR and are seriously stocking up now. Moreover, Russia has the means to support itself food wise.

But, businesses are slowly starting to close. More people are losing their jobs and that can only lead to population devastation. People hate oligarchs wholeheartedly already, i can imagine that they'll finally start to hate Putin as well.

Sadly, that will take time. So far even my dad's friends who are from Ukraine and have parents living in Ukraine believe that Putin started invasion for a reason. The usual narrative that the rest of the world needs our gas and oil and so on. That better to starve than be under the control of US like in the end of 90's....well, to my mind it still doesn't justify the war and horrendous war crimes that are happening in Ukraine at the moment.

America has done things under the table before in terms of not following our own laws when secretly sending weapons.

This is usually done with verbal agreements from key Congressional committee members and the heads of each party. When secrecy and time is at stake, the government will get verbal agreements first and then take care of the legal issues later via Congressional authorization.

But the issue of sending weapons from US military inventory or giving away from equipment, it has to be authorized by Congress or executed via some program that was previously approved by Congress.

Defeat of Nazism is central to Russian nationalism because that's when USSR did a big important thing in world history by sacrificing its own people, which gives Russia now carte blanc to basically step up whenever Nazism makes an appearance (in their mind). WWII is a glory moment for Russians in their history, because despite the huge loss of lives (civilian and otherwise), they think that THEY saved Europe, single-handedly (mind you, the opinions immediately post-war actually do support some of that), when in reality the Soviets had the people whilst the US provided them with lots of stuff they needed (lend-lease). US stuff was very important in getting USSR to that winning point, but if you listen to Russia or Russians, they single-handedly decided the victory in Europe. 

What did actually play a part in USSR collapse was the loss of life in Afghanistan and the arms race and the inability of Soviet economy to keep up with its lies. 

Putin's propaganda is fairly simple. 

Russia fought Nazis and won, saving Europe -> Russia now claims there is Nazism in Ukraine and of course, as the saviour of Europe, it has the holy mission to rid nazism in Ukraine too. Nazis wanted to kill Russians and destroy Russia -> the claimed ""nazis"" in Ukraine want to destroy Russia and kill Russians. 

Ukraine has gotten more self-assured over the last 10 years, Ukrainian identity and language and culture have only gotten stronger since the collapse of the USSR and Ukrainians feel more self-assured that they're not ""little russians"" (a derogatory phrase Russia uses about UKR), but actually a nation on their own. Russia sees this -> Ukraine is a threat to Russia, because they are trying to kill Russian language and culture within Ukraine, and Russia is the protector of ALL Russians worldwide and protector of Russian culture. 

So Putin tells his people that there is Nazism in UKR. People, of course due to the intense glorification of  Red Army winning in WWII, rally to that because Nazism is bad and they've been told that Russia is the sole country that has the historic mission to defeat Nazism. Everybody knows how bad Nazis were, so of course they are being told and they believe that they are saving UKR (or at least they did in the beginning - by now it might be like mass hysteria, not sure if they truly believe it anymore). 

As for Putin - he believes that UKR is a central part of the development of Russian identity and history due to Kievan Rus. Giving UKR up is like foregoing part of the national myth, like giving up the central part of what makes russian a russian in his eyes. 

There's a lot more stuff - you need to google some of the articles that have come out since then, especially the accidentally published victory article that was supposed to go live after Russia's quick victory, which went into details as to WHY Russia believes what its doing.

Ask yourself under what scenario would Russia *use* nuclear weapons?  They have to know that if they use them, they face total annihilation, and given the state and upkeep of their armed forces, the scales might tip against them more than they know.

It stands to reason -- yes, reason, we do still function on that kinda -- that the scenario in which they use nuclear weapons is when they *face* total annihilation themselves as a nation.  An existential threat.  Anything less is pre-emptively signing your own death certificate.

So, now consider: which gets us closer to that: continued and stronger sanctions, or pushing the Russian military out of Ukraine with an explicit promise *not* to cross the border into Russia or to carry the fight onwards into Russia?

If the sanctions are solid (not porous) and persist long enough, they will become an existential threat to Russia all by themselves.

But... and i'm going to shoot down my own thought process here... I think the elephant in the room is that Russia *has no reason to believe us when we say we'll be satisfied with throwing them out of Ukraine*.  They've always believed - and not necessarily wrongly - that we'd love a shot at completely deconstructing them.  So if we go in, saying we'll keep it within Ukraine, they have absolutely no reason to believe we'll stick to that, and as soon as we're done wiping the floor with them in Ukraine it'll be the perfect time to cross the border and ""bring all the bad guys to justice"".

So, while i'm personally [a recent convert to the idea of intervention in Ukraine](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/tvso4l/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i3curnx/), and think we could or should go in with a promise not to go *beyond* Ukraine's borders, what I have started to realize of late is that the Russian mindset gives them absolutely no reason to believe a single thing we say, just like we believe nothing they say.  So as soon as we attack, their thought process follows, we're not just going to push them out of Ukraine, but we're going to push their shit in.  And that's an existential threat too.

I don't see a good way to end this.  Sanctions are slow, but as they squeeze tighter they will come to represent an existential threat all by themselves.  Military action might work but will probably not be believed to be limited in scope, and therefore will be viewed as an existential threat no matter what we say.  Either or, when Putin is pushed in a corner and presented with the real possibility of a) losing his grip on power b) being handed over to international justice, who knows what the fuck he will do.

The hope, I guess, is that sanctions force a retreat so that we drop sanctions and Putin dies of old age or cancer or whatever.  In order to relax sanctions, Russia hands over some mid or even upper level guys responsible for Bucha etc (god knows what else is going to be revealed).

I'm filled with anger, rage in fact at what is being done to Ukranians.  I want all these bastards brought to real justice, not the quick and easy kind but the slow and well-earned kind.  Unfortunately, given the mindset of the leadership of the invaders, I think just about any attempt to help Ukraine will be seen as a way to leverage ""help"" into a full-blown teardown of Russia, which will be viewed as an existential threat, and that'll be that.  So here we are, in the shittiest of shitty positions.

Perhaps i'm dumb for not realizing Russia believes what we say about as much as we believe what they say.",1649164796.0,1649163214.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3he7y8,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

You have poor, uneducated boys from the provinces spoon fed propaganda their whole lives. Alcoholism and corruption are social norms. Putin pushes the image of a ""macho man"" as something to strive for. Therefore they learn that the strong, selfish, and sneaky survive. Think of how bad rape culture still is in the ""civilized West"" and realize that it's way worse in Russia to the point where domestic violence was decriminalized. However, at this point these kids are still mostly harmless, barring shouting matches on online games and standard teenage hooliganism.

Suddenly they hit conscription age. Now, if you're in school, or if your parents have enough money to bribe a doctor to write a note saying you're unfit for duty, you don't have to go. So the kids who end up in uniform in the first place are the bottom of the barrel. Even those who go to officer school are no better. Even if one of them as a secret Einstein, he never had a chance because he probably went to a poorly funded school and had all original cognitive abilities beat out of him by now.

And once they get there it's literally prison, with all the associated torture. You're not paid enough so you learn to bully, loot, and steal. You don't have enough bullets or guns for training so you learn how to march in formation, drink, gamble, and beat each other up.

These boys at the bottom of society eventually get used to it. First they were hazed (read: raped and tortured), and witnessed their friends get hazed. Then the new batch of rookies come in and they get to pay it forward. Then they see helpless Ukrainian civilians, who their officers and supreme leader have told them were Nazis, and lacking the critical thinking to question otherwise, simply do what they've done before. You're frustrated, cold, hungry, and bogged down in waist-deep mud, fighting a war that your officers first said was a training exercise, then promised you would be over in a few days while the locals welcomed you as heroes and liberators. Your Russian daddy beat your Russian mommy the same way. Why are these sub-mini-little-Russians complaining?

If you claim that UKR and RUS are two different countries, with different languages and cultures, then that makes you a Nazi, because in Putin's mind there is just one Russia (which Ukraine is a part of). If you refuse to kotow to Moscow and instead want to align yourself with the west, then that makes you a Nazi because in their view you're putting their state under a threat. If you refuse to see history from Russia's point of view (for example Holodomor or annexation of Baltic states, or post-WWII Eastern European history), then that makes you a nazi.

The price of Mariupol will likely be breaking for Russia much worse than Vukovar was for JNA. Kherson was also quite expansive for Russia to hold they lost a massive helicopter fleet (~40 helicopters), armoured column and quite sizeable logistics column on 3 separate shellings and they kept using the airfield.

Russians also never really took Kherson they never had the forces to take or secure it. They took two villages and the airfield to sort of control the city but now UA is approaching the city and airfield. They advanced fast to some 25km to the city but now the terrain is more broken and advance is slower.

However UA is also cutting Russians at the south by artillery and drone bombing as well as hitting their logistics between Kherson and Mariupol.

It’s why Mariupol front has also stalled Russians have not made any serious gains in last 7 days with some 25-30% of city still under UA control which is draining Russians.

If you stop shipping today, it won't affect consumers for a month or two, as the supply chain takes a while to get to the consumer level. Right now things are being bought and delivered from stock. As those empty out, some of it won't be replenished. If it concerns non-consumer items, that will have a cascading effect on the economy.

* Never with this kind of intended brutality, and never with the intention of destroying anything (apart from maybe ISIS, al-Quaida and Taliban).
* In all wars, bad stuff happen. Because some people are, well, bad.  It's100 % sure that Western indiviual soldiers have done bad stuff; some of it is punished, some isn't. US (CIA and others; support by president Bush) has used the torture method 'waterboarding'. It would be surprising if no Western soldier had punched some POW or stolen something pretty.
* In all ""our"" wars there have also been civilian deaths and the destruction of civilian targets. When we go to war we just call it ""collateral damage"".

There were isolated incidents, sure. And there was a systematic effort to prevent offenders from being properly prosecuted and punished.  But there's a very clear culture, and regulations, in place to try to curtail this stuff, and it was a few isolated incidents, nowhere near as wide scale as what Russians are doing.

In the case of what the Russians are doing, it is widescale, and systematic. Their high-level leadership put together lists of individuals in Ukraine they were interested in.

The way this stuff works is:  if you want to sell you place a sell order at a certain price.  This price is almost always a tiny bit below the official exchange rate.  You do this so your order to sell is executed quickly... (waiting for a transaction has an opportunity cost).  Now if someone else wants to sell they will often undercut your bid a little bit to sell their stuff first.  

If everyone is selling and no one is buying the asking prices goes down down down.

The inverse is true when buying (normally) and the more people who wants to buy will drive the price up.  

What Russia is doing is circumventing all of that due to low volume and placing standing buy orders at a price of x (wherever they want it to be).  When someone goes to sell they see that x is higher than the current price and rather than placing a sell order they sell into the open buy order. 

The price is based in whatever the last trade executed at.  So that's how you can move the price of any traded commodity if you have the financial capital to do it.  (Sorey this proved a lot harder to type out and try to explain on a phone than I expected).

A mistake I am seeing a lot is that several people seem to think that geopolitical decisions are made thinking about what is morally right or wrong, that couldn’t be farthest from the truth. They are generally made considering what course of action grants the greatest benefit to one’s own country while risking as little as possible. Sending weapons to Ukraine helps the West because this war is greatly weakening Russia and it is a relatively risk free course of action on the other hand a direct military intervention doesn’t have any benefit for western countries and carries a risk of nuclear escalation. Also one needs to keep in mind that governments must do what is best for their citizens, sending them to war is not exactly the best for the citizens. One might ask then why would the rest of NATO intervene if Putin for example attacked the Baltics? That kind of intervention wouldn’t be too much of a risk too? The answer is that if NATO lets Putin take the Baltics then it is showing extreme weakness, they are literally telling Putin that he can do whatever he wants, all the Eastern and Central European members of NATO would be up in arms in five seconds because they know they would be next. As for the second question Putin has the power to annihilate all life in Ukraine he could simply drop several nuclear weapons all throughout the country but that would bring NATO in because the fallout would spread to several neighbouring members and they could as a consequence invoke article 5, Putin knows that if NATO intervenes there are only two possible outcomes, he loses the conventional war and then his more aggressive cronies are going to pounce on his weakness and kill him, or he is forced to start a nuclear war, NATO responds in kind and he dies in nuclear fire. Putin is a guy who sits several metres away from his own advisers for fear of getting COVID so he is probably not too eager to die. As a consequence it is unlikely(not impossible but unlikely) that he is going to use any weapon in Ukraine that might bring NATO in. As we have seen the conventional Russian army is not really competent so as of now the possibility that Putin might wipe out Ukraine or kill everyone in it is extremely low",1649150415.0,1649150039.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3gu4pq,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

No. Before this, I didn't see Putin as the villain that the US made him out to be. He seemed like a frequent scapegoat, and I believed that NATO did say they would not take any former bloc countries during the early 90's. It looked to me like he was going to be the next leader to be called a ""dictator"" and forcibly removed. I have since very much reversed my positions on all of these things, with a tonne of reading about Russia. Almost feel stupid for believing what I did, but I was coming from a good place. I didn't like the idea of constantly pissing on a nuclear armed former world power, what was it going to achieve? I didn't know the whole story. I just want war to be a think of the past. *edit* My view on the US has changed for the better. I couldn't stand Biden (or trump fwiw) but he is handling this brilliantly. The fact that Russia's every move was leaked globally before the invasion is quite hilarious in hindsight. 

> 
> Did you support western military intervention at the beginning? Why or why not?

Yes. Quietly. No boots on the ground, but giving Ukraine our old junk, which to them would be a huge help. I didn't want top ammo to fall to the soviets. Didn't think it would drag this long.
> 
> Do you support western military intervention now? Why or why not?

I absolutely do and as anti war as I am, I would consider enlisting (Canada). This can't be a quiet retreat to how things were. The leadership of Russia needs to be destroyed, either economically or through NATO means. Notice I didn't say Russia needs to be wiped out. Reform is possible. Germany after WW2 as an example. This is Putin's ""legacy"", and the worse it goes the more unstable he will become. I am as horrified and disgusted at the footage but none of this would have happened without Putin. These soldiers aren't old enough to buy cigarettes, they are children themselves, and have been sold a lie, and given a green light to do unspeakable things by leadership. Awful.
>

One of three ways. A quiet retreat, creating a new Kashmir type environment, with an east and west Ukraine, or a bankrupt Russia going home, declaring some kind of ""victory"" and Ukraine fortifying its country and rebuilding. Third way, a prolonged conflict that eventually drags others in.

He doesn't care about anything other than his own power. He didn't seem to think the US knowing his plan mattered. He didn't even seem to care that several pieces of the puzzle had not fallen into place. He was gonna do this no matter the cost.

2. Yes. Putin can't threaten the world and get away with it. A man who insists on massive tables because of germophobia and paranoia will grumble and bluster but he's not nuking over this. West would stamp it out before he'd got a foothold.

3. Yes. We should have done so already. We could have stopped Bucha and Mariupol and a lot more. Russian forces are digging in, it's harder to pull up weeds than sweep away dust. We should still act but it's going to be a harder job than if we'd gone for it day one. At the very least we should be neutralising Russian air defences and pushing Russian forces back to the border. The only counterclaim here is that the economic sanctions will break Russia and stop it doing this again. My argument? Why not both. Drive Russia out and keep the sanctions anyway. Bleed them dry, keep them there until their government falls or their nuclear weapons are unserviceable and then cut the head off the monster and build prosperity in its place.

4. Worse than it needed to. Ukraine can win but the cost is going to be high. West will hesitate. If nobody helps Russia, then although there will be bloodshed for another six months or more, the end result will be a spectre over Europe vanquished. Ukraine will rebuild, EU must help it. A new, democratic Russia must be created. Personally, I think that means regime change, war crime trials, Balkanization, and demilitarisation including denuclearisation, exactly the same process that Nazi Germany went through in 1945. We have the ability to achieve that through military plus economic action. 

I see it getting messier if China wades in. I actually argue that's a reason to intervene now. China ultimately wants power projection and wealth. A war with the West denies them both, permanently.

Russia had Ukraine surrounded in strategic positions, they started putting battle identifiers on their tanks - which you only do in actual war. Russians were showing troop movements to the Ukraine border. I also trust U.S. intelligence for the most part.
2. No. I figured Russia was more formidable than they now appear to be, and thought Ukraine would fall within a week. What was the point? From an American perspective, it was a European matter even though we're part of NATO. But Americans shouldn't be sent to die for Ukraine. This is largely a beef between Russia and Ukraine, and only if Putin gets aggressive with the rest of Europe would I be in favor of intervention. 
3. See above. Also, Russia has shown that its military is incapable of defeating Ukraine, so it's in no position to go after any other country at this point. This will likely stay a local conflict between Russia and Ukraine, so it would just be an unnecessary escalation if the west intervened. 
4. I imagine either a long, drawn-out war where neither side makes much progress, or a peace deal will be reached at some point. Whether Russia will get more territory, I don't know.

They may have needed to finish up some sort of production run in order to properly mothball the machinery, or maybe they removed some stuff - control mechanisms, for example - that make it difficult or impossible for Russia to easily restart production.

First, the Russian minorities here (and I presume Latvia as well) watch mostly Russian TV channels from Russia. It makes sense, because the programming is something we can never counter here, because we just don't have the money, but Russian TV has lots of non-news TV shows, TV dramas, movies etc. So they're used to watching these channels for entertainment, but also for news, which means they've been getting a stable dose of Russian propaganda, always. 

Now, there are Russian channels both in Estonia and Latvia, but nothing compared to Russian channels. We banned them now, but you can still access them if you know where to look and nearby border areas people just catch the signals with ordinary antennas. 

So many amongst the minority are completely pro-Putin because they've been watching the Russian channels and believe that what Russia is doing is OK and think \*we\* are the ones being nuts. 

There are splits, though. Younger generations that speak local languages, Russian AND English tend to be either pro-Ukraine or at least not pro-Putin (at the same time, plenty of those younger people supported annexation of Crimea for example). So it can be a generational split - older pro-Putin, younger pro-Ukraine - or a language split - russian-only is pro-putin, other languages too means they're more likely to be pro-Ukraine. Splits within families, communities, schools are already there, because although it is a ""Russian"" community, it actually means anybody who speaks Russian as a first language, which could actually mean the person is Ukrainian, Belarussian, Kazakh etc. so there can also be a split between the ethnicities within the community - Russian speaking Ukrainians pro-Ukraine, others pro-Putin etc.",False,1649153142.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3gyn1o,,2,33,0,33,0,0,

> One of the classic propositions in international economics is known as the “impossible trinity.” The idea is that there are three things a country might want from its currency. It might want stability in the currency’s value in terms of other currencies — for example, a stable value of the ruble in dollars or euros — to create greater certainty for businesses. It might want free movement of funds across its borders, again to facilitate business. And it might want to retain freedom of monetary action — the ability to cut interest rates to fight recessions or raise them to fight inflation.

> The impossible trinity says that you can’t have it all, that you have to choose two out of three. You can, like Britain, have open capital markets and independent monetary policy, but that means allowing the value of the pound to fluctuate. You can, like countries that have adopted the euro, have free movement of capital and currency stability, but only by giving up monetary independence. Or you can, like China, have a stable currency and your own monetary policy, but only by maintaining capital controls. (Those controls, by the way, are one main reason the renminbi isn’t going to rival the dollar as a global currency for the foreseeable future.)

> So what’s puzzling about Russia? Normally a country can choose two out of three legs of the trinity; Russia has decided to take only one. It has imposed severe capital controls, but it has also sacrificed monetary independence, drastically raising interest rates in the face of a looming recession.

> ...

> If Russia’s economy deteriorates as badly as most expect in the near future, it seems all too likely that the nation’s muzzled media will simply deny that anything bad is happening. One thing they couldn’t deny, however, would be a drastically depreciated ruble.

Russia can bitch and moan all they want but they're still fighting a Ukraine pilot, or a pilot who is not active US military.   Lets say we send an F16 into the battle, then things are bad because now its the US vs Russia.

We haven't sent an F16, not because it would be considered a direct attack but because a F16 requires months to train the pilot and the ground crews and the weapons are all different and we have to modify the planes so they don't have secret NATO equipment in them.  In short, an F16 isn't just a F16, its an entire very complicated and very expensive ecosystem.

But migs... that's another story.  I expect that the polish and baltic migs are having their secret NATO stuffed removed right now and that as Ukraine goes on the offensive you'll see stories of tanks and aircraft being supplied...

Their whole world collapses and, for a while, all the other nations that were part of their old empire were suffering and starving just the same as they were. Then, one day, their neighbors turn up with something shiny and new - *democratic freedom*. Just across a border they see the wonderful things the West has provided to their neighbor: Ideals of free speech and religion and information, ideals of economic mobility, ideals of incorrupt governance. They see the people who suffered alongside them with nicer homes and nicer, newer things. But instead of being *happy* for their neighbors, they instead become spiteful: ""Why *do they deserve it?*"" They are shown what great things are possible if they were to change their ways - but they *don't want to change*, they just want the things; Upon seeing the broader truth, they are not enlightened but rather enraged, furious that their neighbors would have the gall to tarnish the illusion that their nations are equal.

It's incredibly depressing, because it implies there's a foundational, cultural problem larger than any war can resolve; this selfish, self-loathing bitterness will last in Russia for a generation if not longer.

Switchblades perform a different role to conventional drones, and actually are better understood as being more like those other weapons you mention than a drone operated by someone in a control room somewhere- Like Javelins or Stingers, they are man portable technology for infantry, which make them way more effective and give them the capacity to sort out problems without needing to wait for fire support or expose themselves.

The 300 is basically a cheat code for any infantry squad in a firefight. If they get pinned down under fire, they launch the drone, use it to find the people or vehicle shooting at them out to 10km and dive bomb them with enough explosive force to kill all the occupants of a light vehicle, or a gun crew or snipers, or an emplaced position or whatever. Just launch the drone, fly around till you find the thing shooting at you and kill it.

The 600 does the same thing but with a range out to 40km, and an explosive charge equivalent to a Javelin, in other words bye bye tank, apc or tracked gun. So if russian armored self propelled howitzer start shelling a ukrainian position or town from 20km away, and they have a 600 handy, no matter what they do next that howitzer's crew has about 8 minutes left to live, being the time it takes for a 600 to be launched, fly to the target and incinerate it.

The majority of Circassians were targeted, though a minority who accepted Russification remained. It has been reported that during the events, the Russian-Cossack forces used various methods, such as tearing the bellies of pregnant women.

Article 13 simply states:

>…prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.

The phrase “public curiosity” has been interpreted as referring to any photographs of POWs of any kind, ever, but this is almost certainly not what was intended by the clause, and it’s arguable whether it is a clause that harms more than it helps in regards to using it to suppress the dissemination of media.

The actual intentionality of the clause is likely referring to displays of POWs which robs them of basic dignity or shows them being mistreated, which is in line with the rest of the verbiage. Showing POWs under circumstances which inform as a public accounting and which do not show the prisoners being mistreated would probably be upheld in any challenge as legal. The article doesn’t even mention media of any kind, and is likely referring to actual displays of soldiers in persona.

Lots of people over the decades have used this clause as a means of trying punish nations for crimes that they otherwise have little power to eke out, such as with the Abu Grhaib images, but the repeated assertions over the decades that *all* images are in violation of article 13 simply does not stand up to scrutiny. 

It’s also arguable whether it is appropriate for the Geneva Convention to act in any way that suppresses public discourse, or is designed to suppress such discourse, but that’s a question for another time.

Calling on the United States Government to uphold the founding democratic principles of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establish a Center for Democratic Resilience within the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is the world’s preeminent political and military alliance committed to democracy and the collective defense of its members;

Whereas the preamble of NATO’s founding North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington, DC, on April 4, 1949, declares the alliance is “founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law”;

Whereas democracies across the alliance face external threats from authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China and internal threats from proponents of illiberalism;

Whereas there is a broad agreement within the alliance of the need to strengthen the democracies of NATO members, partners, and aspirant countries;

Whereas, in April 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed an independent Reflection Group tasked with supporting a forward-looking reflection process meant to strengthen the political dimension of the alliance;

Whereas the Reflection Group’s report, “NATO 2030: United for a New Era”, included analyses and recommendations for the alliance to address “ ‘democratic recession,’ the global erosion of democratic norms, and the rise of authoritarianism”, including—

(1) “A shared democratic identity is what distinguishes the Alliance from the principal threats and challenges it faces.”;

(2) “NATO should reassert its core identity as an Alliance rooted in the principles of democracy.”;

(3) “Any commitment to strengthening NATO’s political cohesion therefore has to be orientated toward those shared values and ideals, grounded in democracy, rule of law and individual liberty.”; and

(4) recommending the establishment of a Center of Excellence for Democratic Resilience in order to strengthen NATO democracies against external threats;

Whereas the Brussels Summit Communiqué issued by the Heads of State and Government participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on June 14, 2021, stated—

(1) “NATO is the strongest and most successful Alliance in history. It guarantees the security of our territory and our one billion citizens, our freedom, and the values we share, including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.”;

(2) “State and non-state actors challenge the rules-based international order and seek to undermine democracy across the globe.”; and

(3) “We reaffirm the Alliance’s shared democratic principles as well as our commitment to the spirit and the letter of the North Atlantic Treaty.”;

Whereas in Brussels the Allies also committed to updating NATO’s Strategic Concept;

Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has reiterated that one of the primary purposes of updating the Strategic Concept must be a recommitment to the founding values of the alliance;

Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly supports a new Strategic Concept that reaffirms that the support and strengthening of democratic institutions is foundational to the collective security of Allies; and

Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has endorsed and advanced a proposal to establish a NATO Center for Democratic Resilience within NATO headquarters for the purposes of monitoring and identifying challenges to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law and facilitating democracy and governance assistance to member, partner, and aspirant states, when requested: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) reaffirms its unequivocal support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as an alliance founded on democratic principles;

(2) calls on the President to use the voice and vote of the United States to adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that is clear about its support for shared democratic values and committed to enhancing NATO’s capacity to strengthen democratic institutions within NATO member, partner, and aspirant countries; and

But I believe one of the largest issues of not wanting to send troops in is for ground troops to go in en masse air superiority is a must for Western/Nato governments - we value the lives of the soldier more than Russia does or ever has done. 

In order to gain air superiority in Eastern Ukraine incursions would have to go across the border to destroy AA positions and airfields.  

You can't put NATO boots on the ground (apart from special forces) without going across the border so you're in a an immediate catch 22. 

This is probably one of the biggest stalling points on giving jets to the war.  If a US jet gets shot down in Russia even with a Ukrainian pilot on board it is whole new level.

It is not that NATO intervening in Ukraine directly will instantly cause nuclear apocalypse, but rather that NATO intervening directly could lead to a scenario where a series of seemingly reasonable choices or unintended miscalculations leads to a nuclear exchange. 

For example, NATO intervenes in Ukraine. To begin with they seek to establish air superiority. This requires SEAD (suppression of enemy air defense) operations targeting Russian AA sites. A great deal of the S-400 sites are in Russia itself.  NATO targets these in a limited strike but ends up killing some civilians by mistake. Russia responds by attacking trains inside of Poland they believe are loaded with weapons meant for Ukraine. Some of the trains are carrying civilians. NATO then responds by trying to eliminate Russian SRBM mobile platforms inside Russia, like Iskander-M launchers. Russia views this as an attempt to weaken the Russian nuclear deterrent and responds by torpedoing a US Ohio class guided missile sub. 

Holy shit, now the Pentagon is going bananas because they fear the nuclear triad is at risk. They put all nuclear forces on the highest alert level and scramble nuclear bombers.

I kinda disagree based on the following:

- Ukraine, fully mobilised, outnumber the Russian invasion force by a decent margin. This can change if Russia mobilises of course, but as it stands there are no concrete signs of this.

- Russia is funding their own war. A big chunk of the Ukrainian war efforts will continue to be funded by the West.

- Javelins, stingers and drones, which are being supplied to Ukraine en-masse, are fantastic for both defensive attrition and guerilla warfare.

- Length of supply lines

- Occupying territory means occupying hostile civilians. They might not fight, but you can bet they'll supply information.

-Morale. Don't think I need to expand on this. Ukrainians won't ever have to ask themselves ""why are we even here?""

In Ukraine the territory was better known as Stepovyna (Steppeland) or Nyz (Lower land). It was formed as a new imperial province of Russia (Novorossiya Governorate) in 1764 from military frontier regions along with parts of the southern Hetmanate in preparation for war with the Ottomans.

In fact the sugar in particular is a terrible metric since its domestically produced.  The sanctions though will hit and hit in very different ways.

For now it is a waiting game, for warehoused stocks of foreign produced goods evaporate, thus impacting dependent production. This is a process and it will effect specific goods, generally not so much as day to day life but core things to run a society. Computers for example, servers internet backbones will eventually need parts sourced outside Russia. Precise machined parts that effect engines and machinery that disable factories, farming equipment, enterprises, munitions production,   . This is more fundamental than just running out of tea. It will definitely take longer but it is indeed a long game. 

Public perception is important but given false pretenses that the sanctions have hit and they're clear will be to later redirect blame or prop it up before its true impact.

 >The Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989) was a conflict wherein insurgent groups known collectively as the Mujahideen, as well as smaller Marxist–Leninist–Maoist groups, fought a nine-year guerrilla war against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) and the Soviet Army throughout the 1980s, mostly in the Afghan countryside. The Mujahideen were variously backed primarily by the United States, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, and the United Kingdom; the conflict was a Cold War-era proxy war. Between 562,000 and 2,000,000 Afghans were killed and millions more fled the country as refugees, mostly to Pakistan and Iran. Between 6.

> A decision reached by consensus is an agreement reached by common consent.

> **Consensus decision-making is a fundamental principle which has been accepted as the sole basis for decision-making in NATO since the creation of the Alliance in 1949**.

> Consensus decision-making means that there is no voting at NATO. **Consultations take place until a decision that is acceptable to all is reached**.

41173a5ffe4b7dcd410272e4c8f95afc,twkwe0,i3iod4q,"> Your only solution is to run.

Only if you're actually faster than the tank. A T-72 travels at 75km/hr. A decent sprinter can run maybe 20km/hr (flat ground, carrying nothing). If you're carrying a 25lb weapon + 30lbs of body armor, you're going to be sprinting at 12km/hr at best (Think you can run 1km in 5 minutes while carrying 55lbs of stuff?)

Tanks almost universally have night-vision and thermal-vision systems. Not only is it basically impossible to outrun, you also can't really hide from it. (The tank has a very narrow range of vision, but its got very good vision under that narrow range. Tanks are easy to ambush, but they can track you down and chase you down very effectively).

-------

That's why its important for soldiers to have a Humvee nearby (or an IFV or other vehicle). Hop into the vehicle and GTFO, its really the only way you can outrun a tank in practice.

----

The 120mm gun on a tank also ignores almost all forms of cover. Tree trunks? They splinter and turn the wood into shrapnel, killing everyone behind them.

Concrete walls? Same thing. Concrete only gets turned into shrapnel, and blow up much like a shotgun pellet, and all humans behind the wall die from the tank shot.

Hide behind a hill? Maybe good for one shot. But entire hills are erased by a singular 120mm gunshot, and the 2nd shot will be clear to hit the targets behind.

A withdrawal is what we've seen.  They didn't plan for it, and believed they could take Kyiv.  The resistance was far greater than expected, and they suffered far greater losses than anticipated.  Military and strategic goals were not realised.  However, forces withdrew under order, in order mostly and along planned routes and schedules.

Liberals, socialists, taxes, LGBTQ issues, are the Boogeyman.

Putin has been grooming the GOP elite for years.

And most of it is accomplished via Christianity and their one there God, greed.

There is very little substance to GOP policy. It basically amounts to being anti anything from Dems, or slightly right of center.

How much actual, significant federal legislation has the GOP passed?

I'm sure it exists but it's few and far between.

Between the laughable ""No Child Left Behind"" of W to the criminal Trump Tax Cuts for the rich (his only signature piece of legislation), anything else of significance pass?

They mostly utilize obstruction as they do not care what the optics of a ""do nothing"" congress means. They know that hurts Dems much more than GOP.
The resulting ineffectiveness only pushes more austerity measures. They starve everything that isn't military or big business subsidies. Then it's, ""See? It doesn't work."" More cuts.

The only thing they consistently push for is tax cuts, smaller government, and privatization.

Russia is like a cocaine fueled orgy to the GOP.

All the powerful American right can see is that they'll soon be a billionaire if we can expand our oligarchic system here.

Our nation is the richest in the world.
By a lot.
Yet the GOP is ever claiming we have nothing in the coffers.

No, we refuse to put anything in the coffers and then pretend we're broke. It's fucking bullshit. And it's unsustainable.

The Dems are complicit in this in that they beg for crumbs instead of vice versa.

It is not the economy of red states that give us our vast wealth. They run deficits. It is the hated, in their eyes, liberal coastal elites. California alone is the world's fifth largest economy. Ran a fucking surplus recently! GOP desperately wants that wealth under a Russian style system.

875d7f9988b305b2ad2e8214642256af,twkwe0,i3grp1r,"Okay, anecdotal stuff, but here are some things I've heard people say about Soviets and Russians.

For example, people here say that your average Russian will care about their home - their homes will be very nice places if they can make it so, but they will absolutely not care about the shared public property outside of that home. 

During Soviet time, for example, thievery from work was very common. The state was what it was - towards the end there was a lack of plenty - and people said ""well, the state is owned by the people, so this stuff is also owned by the people, which is me, so the state won't miss if I take XYZ"". As such, it was quite common to see that if someone worked in construction or something, they'd slowly also build up their own summer dacha from stuff they could get from work, for example. 

Or another joke told here about Soviet times. There were sometimes delays in payment and Soviet system was all about the 5-year plan (not conceivable) and doing said 5-year plan in 4-years instead (even less conceivable, so lots of cooked books). So at one point, people even joked ""we pretend to work, so they can pretend paying for said work"". 

The point is - life in USSR was difficult plenty of times and probably even more so in Russia. USSR was, in theory, all about caring for the common man, but in reality, if one could make oneself better on behalf of someone else, you'd do it in a heartbeat. Little bits of power were everything. For example, going to a hospital in USSR times was a nightmare - literally everybody, even the cleaning lady, were above the patient and everybody accepted that. A shop seller could've been more important than a secretary, because if you got along with the seller well, you could get rare goods under the counter for something in return, when those rare goods would rarely or never hit the actual counter. 

The Soviet system was all about equality in theory and there was some - most people were similarly dressed, with similar housing, furniture, schools and kindergartens, even the books at the home were the same. Life was pretty crap for everyone, for sure, in hindsight. But in reality, the Soviet system was always hierarchical. If you worked in a good soviet kolkhoz or sovhoz, chances were that your K or S had a summer residence somewhere, where you could go and get a ticket for your family. The better K or S, the better residence, some even in Ukraine next to the Black Sea. If your kid did really well, they could've been chosen for Artek, which was a coveted children's camp nearby the Black Sea. The Estonian SSR leadership had a summer residence nearby the Baltic Sea for example - again, only accessible to those in leadership positions, not to everybody else. 

Putin, for example, would've been in the ranks of those who had access to special providence. Chances are that he had access to foods and items the average Soviet person did not have access to (here they called these ""currency shops"", because you could buy stuff there you couldn't get anywhere else, but only for foreign currency, which was forbidden to be owned by an average soviet), probably had a nicer/newer apartment than your average Soviet, also probably had a car - for which here the average person first needed a car buying licence (and you waited for that licence some several years) and then you needed to wait until your car was being manufactured (again, some few years possibly). 

So the Soviet person had avenues to better their station and better their station they did when it was possible. I wouldn't be surprised if the same attitude has carried over to modern day Russia, if I'm honest.",False,1649146650.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3glzpe,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Mainly because I don't believe you need a no-fly-zone in the way one might think.  We could deploy advanced anti-air defenses to or even near Ukraine, in Poland, run by US/NATO folks, and their AA over the border wouldn't be a consideration.  It's effectively a no-fly zone if everything they try to put up there dies.  Of course, that would just invite a strike on Poland...

You can take military action without necessarily having to cross over the border to deal with AA - you be careful where you deploy your air because of their defenses, and focus on making it unsafe for them instead.

The south, close to Turkey, you can operate more freely.  Clear the Black Sea and the Azov Sea of all Russian warships.  You obliterate everything military on Crimea, specifically all airfields, fuel and ammunition supplies.  Smash that fancy bridge too.  Suddenly all logistics and support from the south evaporates, their hold on Kherson and Mariupol is drastically weakened and their only remaining supply lines are from the east through Luhansk and are stretched to breaking.

Hell, you could probably most of that from a great distance.  Taking the Crimea arm out of the picture will turn this shit around fast.  Then it'll be Ukraine (backed by the west) staring at the Russian toehold in Donetsk and Luhansk.

But, as I said above, Russia has no reason to believe anything the west does will be limited in scope.  That's the *real* problem.

Well, that last part isn't happening.  Edit: actually, that can't be right at all, if you think about it.  Hmm.

They're also not getting parts sourced from western suppliers which is... well, lotsa stuff.  They used to make a lot of stuff in-house... back in the Soviet Union.  Today not so much.  Yay globalization.

The problem is if we stop buying their oil, the logistics to transport it all to China doesn't exist.

 >Cockburn ( KOH-burn) is a town and locality in the east of the Australian state of South Australia at the border with New South Wales near Broken Hill. Huge ore deposits were discovered in Silverton, which in 1884 prompted the government of South Australia to offer to the Government of New South Wales the building of a narrow gauge railway line from the limit of its jurisdiction at the border to Silverton, since horse-drawn drays over rough tracks could not meet the transport task for the journey to Port Pirie. This offer was rejected by the New South Wales government.

How about we enforce fossil plants to handle their waste, and increase their security standards and we will see how cheap that production would be.

As it is now, fossils can get away with dumping all their waste straight into the atmosphere, and kill millions of people every year from air pollution. Not even counting the mess that is the excavation phase here.

>nuclear waste is still an unsolved question.

Pretty sure thats wrong, its been disposable for a long time. And thats not even counting new reactors that will run on spent fuel.


> uranium mining is dirty 

And are solar panels, windturbines and even hydroelectric environmental friendly? Last time I checked renewables systems are by far more resource intensive compared to nuclear, especally in terms of ""rare earth metals"" (that aren't rare, but are extremly damaging to the environment when extracted)

And no matter how you twist it, nuclear reactions are millions time more energy efficient than any other form of energy, and thus it will always mean less intrusion and excavations on the environment.


>and if that wasnt bad enough russia almost blew up the largest nuclear powerplant in europe

And they are also threatening with nuclear war (fusion bombs), and are holding Europe as a hostage in financing their criminal war, and plans to destabilize the world for their ""new world order"".


>but yeah, lets keep doing that instead of wind and solar. big brain energy.

They aren't that efficient yet, and the amount of energy obtainable per m^2 will always be finite with renewables (it is for nuclear too, but in an entirely different category obviously).

As it is today, all wind parks and solar farms are heavily supplemented by natural gas (which is our problem btw), due to inherent unreliability of all renewable system (hydro being the best obv).",1649198843.0,1649198560.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3juzk8,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

There are a lot of ways Russia could militarily annoy Japan.

The only way Russia gets anything to Australia is by using air assets from their carrier. Their one carrier. The one that's broken. Way too far for land-based aircraft other than unescorted Bears the Aussies would have no trouble downing. Surface vessels with no air cover wouldn't make it within range without being sunk. No obvious friendly landmass from which to launch SRBMs or cruise missiles.

**Combined-arms** is elementary military tactics. Military forces do better when they have multiple complementary tools at their disposal. It greatly improves a force's adaptability. In countless videos we've see Ukrainians fight not just with Javelin strikes, but also riflemen, tanks, and armored personnel carriers. In fact, one of the major reasons we see Russians are doing so poorly seems to be their failure to link armor and infantry. 

More Ukrainian fighter jets would greatly enhance Ukrainian air defenses, both by baiting ambushes and by keeping already skittish Russian bombers at an even greater distance. 

""We"" aka Western leaders, should better listen to Ukrainians when they tell us what they need to keep fighting: Soviet model jets & SAM AA systems they have experience with.

Surprises people but as a static MG, nothing at all wrong with a water cooled Maxim. Very reliable if you have water for it. Controllable, medium rate of fire, generally runs well, capable of insane quantities of sustained fire. It's not really obsolete. It's more that seeing one in use is rare because water cooled machine guns are not common in modern armies.

The only reason it really became unpopular is its sheer size and subsequent lack of portability, modern military doctrine values easily packed down FOBs and temporary locations. If you want to defend something that doesn't move, like a dock or a railyard, where you might shoot a lot in a short space of time, it's still a fabulous gun.

As you say, they're very good for heavy use, unlike an air cooled gun so long as you've got ammunition you can keep the trigger held down basically all day, the only reason to stop firing is wearing the rifling out of the barrel.",False,1649199658.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3jwgo2,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

The thinking also was that if they brought Russia into the west by buying their oil etc that they would have too much to lose if they started throwing their weight around. A bet that clearly didn't work out as planned. Putin rather than be worried about having the gas and oil pipes turned off took the attitude that the west needed him too much so would turn a blind eye to his geo-political ambitions. That bet also isn't working out as intended. 

Germany faces a real problem - shut off Russian oil/gas, starve Putin but tank their economy - and with it western Europe's, or hope that the invasion ends quickly and that someone deposes Putin also quickly and things can go back to normal, whatever that is.

Every so often, I’ll see someone in here asking when the Ukrainians are going to “hit back.” They’ve been getting their hits in aplenty. It’s just not always obvious until it is. I don’t know if you follow mma, but this has reminded me very much of BJ Penn fighting Diego Sanchez back in the day.

 >The Phrygian cap () or liberty cap is a soft conical cap with the apex bent over, associated in antiquity with several peoples in Eastern Europe and Anatolia, including the Persians, Medes, Scythians, Balkans, Dacia, Thrace and Phrygia, where the name originated. The oldest depiction of the Phygian cap is from Persepolis in Iran. Although Phrygian caps did not originally function as liberty caps, they came to signify freedom and the pursuit of liberty first in the American Revolution and then in the French Revolution.

Yeah, being able to regulate production is what makes it the ""best"" option. Which is a factor that does not apply to most renewable systems.

No sun = 0 production, low/too high win = 0 production.

> so its much better than even a 100% stable plant which btw neither nuclear

Actually, nuclear generally has the highest capacity factor of any form of energy production , while renewables are usually in the lower range. Lets say a windturbine has capacity factor of 40%, which means that throughout its entire lifespan, it will only produce energy 40% of the time.


>you could also just build off shore wind which is pretty reliable

Sure, and now go calculate how many wind turbines you need to cover Germany's power grid (or only to replace coal/gas and adjusted for electric heating and cooking). It would be thousands of them, and keep in mind they are massive constructions that take up massive areas between them to maintain good air flow.



>if you really want to avoid storage for whatever weird reason

Thats not an option, really. Unless natural gas is used, or other supplementary systems. Which brings us back to the initial problem.

Russia will not use a nuke in a conflict that is ""solely restricted"" to Ukraine vs Russia, no matter how many weapons and supplies we send to Ukraine short of nuclear weapons themselves.

Like the chances of Russia using a tactical nuke in Ukraine in that scenario is pretty much the same as it was before the war happened.

Russia still loses in this scenario where they're completely economically isolated, and Ukraine gets a shit ton of military aid, but we avoid meaningfully increasing the risks of a nuclear conflict, now (""Uh oh, NATO's here..."") or later, because get this...

...Even if nothing bad happens, you've made conventional war between nuclear armed powers ""more acceptable."" Like, unequivocal, not-hidden, not pretending conventional war.

""Well, THAT one didn't turn into a nuclear war...so maybe this one won't either.""

Now, here are some situations where I would believe we need to directly militarily intervene:

1. Russia uses a tactical nuke on Ukraine without NATO doing any direct involvement. At that point, it doesn't matter because the genie is out of the bottle. And NATO needs to put a lid on that shit real fast.
2. Russia fully mobilizes, and there is undeniable evidence that they will be able to win and occupy the country, and subject it to its vision (which as we've seen, would be ""very not good"").

These are my red lines.

But until that happens, I don't believe we should be doing a No-Fly-Zone, or directly intervening.

For some reason though, this is the ""dove"" position in some people's heads.

In addition, Russia losing ""just"" to Ukraine, would completely invalidate Russia's military.

Russia believes that they're super strong, losing to Ukrainians utilizing Western equipment would really show that Russia is a pathetic country that's barely relevant outside of nukes. No excuses anymore.

It will be much easier for Russia to come to terms with that--as funny for us and humiliating for them--than if we directly intervened and, consequently, prevent Russia from trying this shit again 20 years later.",1649140747.0,1649140039.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3ghj0x,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Ehhhhh... their armed forces are about ~200,000, with only 35,000 reserve *all in*. They *used* to be quite militaristic. Now, less so. 

Turkey on the other hand, has ~350,000 regular and ~380,000 reserves -  a much more substantive force. 

Turkey's air force is larger and, like France, is equipped with excellent 4th gen aircraft.

The next most important army in Europe, and maybe the EU's largest, *would* be Greece, with a regular force about the size of France's, over 200,000 reserve personnel and a conscription-trained population behind them.

>Got questions about why I think it is genocide. Until this morning I resisted applying the term. War crimes? Sure. Heinous rhetoric? You bet. What changed is the combination of more and more evidence, from different places, and even more importantly, explicit official rhetoric.

>The official legal definition of genocide is “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such”. When I teach genocide I start by saying that this definition has huge problems because it doesn’t give us clear thresholds (what “in part” does even mean?) and because it is almost impossible to prove intent. People who carry out genocide are usually not idiots, if there are orders at all they would be given orally.

>But, several things are important to realize. First, something that doesn’t start as genocide might evolve into one when conditions change. Russian invasion, in my view, did not start with clear genocidal intent, but evolved into one. Regime change and colonial subjugation are by themselves not enough to constitute genocide. Second, more evidence that Bucha is not an exception. Each massacre might be local initiative, together they are a campaign. And most importantly, the RIA Novosti (a state outlet) piece is one of the most explicit statements of intent to destroy a national group as such that I’ve ever seen.

If you're looking for insight into why he's doing what he's doing, I refer you to read this: [https://agdugintranslate.gitbook.io/foundations-of-geopolitics/](https://agdugintranslate.gitbook.io/foundations-of-geopolitics/)

It's a book published in 1997, written by one of Putin's head advisors when he was still in the KGB. The book itself is based on a report of the same name, with the central idea of ""ignoring the minutia of 'how' (e.g. sending troops to here, or paying politicians so and so), how would one position Russia to become the dominant power on the planet?""

What we are seeing now in Ukraine (and what we've *been* seeing in many other places) are a result of Putin's drive towards making the goals outlined in this book a reality. If you're under the impression that Russia is currently losing the war, you might be standing a little too close to the elephant: They may be losing battles in Ukraine, and may even lose the fight for Ukraine entirely (this time), but they're still winning the war abroad: In 2016, they helped change votes in states such as Georgia and Alabama - and in doing so, got Trump ""elected"" (see [https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report\_Volume2.pdf](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf) for more information on that). In 2021, on Jan 6th, the man they helped ""elect"" tried to stage a coup to overthrow the government - the government, mind you, of the strongest, most militarily capable country on this Earth.

The french troops are well trained, have good modern equipments on the three main military branch and more importantly can maintain supply lines overseas when they project. On top of that it is not a green army as they have been fighting for nearly two decades with high sucess rate.

Risk assessment had been made when the Turkish crisis of 2020 was at the paroxysm with potential conflict between France and Turkey. Nuke non wisthanding the main conclusion was that while it would be impossible to invade Turkey, the turk would have been boxed in their territories despite the larger airforce. The Turk are still a land army at core (The new drones are an effort to improve on that)

In case of a Finnish invasion they are able to deploy rapidly there, supply lines is less of an issue in allied territory.

They don't want one but they'll do one if it comes to that. Same as the US. 

>And they will not create a situation like that if the west send peacekeeping forces to Ukraine.

That is not a reasonable assumption at all in response to NATO using force against their military. They would have to respond or what stops the ""peacekeeping force"" from ejecting them from Ukraine including Crimea or even invading Russia? Admit you want to get into a shooting war with Russia and ""just a smol bean peacekeeping force uwu"" isn't going to change the response.

>We can't let this maniac hold us hostage forever. We need to put our foot down before it is too late.

We can and that's basically what the Cold War was. The only reason we didn't end society was that people on both sides realized that you can't have your way all the time and you have to accept that some things are just outside your control. You can't ""put your foot down"", because the other side can match your force. That's why the US couldn't depose the communist governments of Eastern Europe and let them remain in place until they fell apart by themselves.

>When west showed Soviets that we didn't want to put up with their bullshit they backed down.

And all increasing shipment of arms to Ukraine is what’s needed to end the war. These are the only shipment of Armor to reach Ukraine yet, they are therefor what’s needed to end the war. Sure they maybe superseded by other stuff or more stuff MAYBE but let’s live in reality shall we.

You’re a walking contradiction, these aren’t enough….. yet they are the only armour provided  

Are you waiting for the Schrodinger’s delivery of Iron dome, F22 and Nukes before you will say something is the equipment helping to end the war


Well maintained T72’s that Ukraine will be able to retrofit with the ample spare parts they have recovered will be totally adequate for providing the protection they need to cover artillery units or infantry units so they can be more aggressive then they currently are.

The only think you have right is your morphing in to they need for more of this",False,1649182497.0,t3_twkwe0,t1_i3ioqc6,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

Ukraine needs more than old tanks to win this war. How much do you think a couple old vehicles will do to russians who actually have the chance to dig in, resupply and fortify. It will jist be the inverse of what ukraine is doing to russia bur without as many bodies to throw at the enemy.

If the russias dig in the east and resuply it will be very difficult for ukraine to push through, even with a handful of additional vehicles. We've seen these same vehicles be slaughtered defensively by the ukrainians. They wont do much better against dug in reussians.
