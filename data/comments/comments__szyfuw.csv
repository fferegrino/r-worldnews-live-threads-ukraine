Pentagon is tracking reported incursion of troops from Belarus into Ukraine, source says
From CNN's Katie Bo Lillis
The US Department of Defense is tracking the reported incursion of troops from Belarus into Ukraine, a US defense official said Thursday.  

It was not clear if the troops were only Russian or also Belarusian, the source said.

Some context: Through a livestream video, CNN witnessed troops atop a column of military vehicles entering Ukraine from a border crossing with Belarus at about 6:48 a.m. local time Thursday.

The livestream video was taken at the Senkivka, Ukraine, crossing with Veselovka, Belarus.

In recent weeks, Russia has amassed a significant number of troops, vehicles and tanks in Belarus near the border with Ukraine. During that time, the two countries have held joint military exercises across the countries, and near the Belarus-Ukrainian border.

Early Thursday, the Ukrainian state border service said the country was attacked through multiple borders, including Belarus.",False,1645682888.0,t3_szyfuw,t3_szyfuw,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

I wrote the following [five days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/warinukraine/comments/svpjcz/comment/hxhlhfb/) regarding airborne troop movements:

“45th and 31st probably already in Belarus.

7th undoubtedly in Crimea already. 83rd and 11th also likely deployed somewhere along the border too.”

7th was just [observed](https://mobile.twitter.com/RALee85/status/1496663646172291073) in Crimea:

“VDV BMD-2, BTR-D, and Tigr vehicles reportedly in Crimea. Presumably, from the VDV's 7th Mountain Air Assault Division.”

Earlier tonight we [saw](https://mobile.twitter.com/MotolkoHelp/status/1496601519793348614) an IL-76 fly from Ulyanovsk to Belarus:

“Il-76 military transport aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces (RF-78657) flew from Ulyanovsk and landed in Gomel.
In particular, the 31st Separate Guards Air Assault Brigade is stationed in Ulyanovsk.”

Likely bringing in personnel.

VDV= Russian airborne forces, the shock troops.

This follows the 106th and 76th airborne divisions observed with equipment rigged for paradrops and 9 IL-76s leaving Taganrog airfield yesterday. 

So far then we’ve seen elements of 3 airborne divisions + the 31st airborne brigade. No way the 45th and 98th aren’t involved, or the 83rd and 11th brigades from out east. Not sure where those latter two would be, possibly Belarus but they could also be used to reinforce the Crimea buildup as the south only has the 7th division, while the west has 3 divisions + the 45th VDV spetsnaz brigade.",False,1645668241.0,t3_szyfuw,t3_szyfuw,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Get inside the nearest building to avoid radiation. Brick or concrete are best.

Remove contaminated clothing and wipe off or wash unprotected skin if you were outside after the fallout arrived. Hand sanitizer does not protect against fall out. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, if possible. Do not use disinfectant wipes on your skin.

Go to the basement or middle of the building. Stay away from the outer walls and roof. 

Prepare NOW

Identify shelter locations. Identify the best shelter location near where you spend a lot of time, such as home, work, and school. The best locations are underground and in the middle of larger buildings.

Outdoor areas, vehicles, mobile homes do NOT provide adequate shelter. Look for basements or the center of large multistory buildings.

Bright FLASH can cause temporary blindness for less than a minute.

BLAST WAVE can cause death, injury, and damage to structures several miles out from the blast.

RADIATION can damage cells of the body. Large exposures can cause radiation sickness.

FIRE AND HEAT can cause death, burn injuries, and damage to structures several miles out.

Well, what is the answer to this, the results of the Second World War, as well as the sacrifices made by our people on the altars of victory over Nazism, but this does not contradict the high values ​​\\u200b\\u200bof a person, based on the realities that have settled down today for all post-war decades, also does not cancel the right of Nations to self-determination enshrined in article one Gustov Remind me that during the creation of the USSR after the Second World War, no one ever asked people who lived in certain territories that are part of modern Ukraine about how they themselves want to arrange their lives at the heart of our policy Freedom Freedom of choice for everyone to independently determine their future and future of their children and we believe that they can use this right in the right of choice All the peoples living on the territory of today's Ukraine, everyone who wants it in this regard, I appeal to the citizens of Ukraine in 2014, Russia was obliged to protect the inhabitants of Crimea and Sevastopol from those whom you call the noses of the Crimeans Sevastopol made and Russia removes their choice to be with their historical homeland And they supported, I repeat, they simply could not do otherwise today's events are connected with the desire of a man for the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, they are connected with the protection of the Russians themselves, those who took Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and it of the people to repeat our actions This is self-defense against the threats posed to us and from an even greater misfortune than what is happening today, no matter how hard it is to understand this well and call for interaction in order to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and move forward together, does not allow anyone to interfere in our you are our relations, but to build them on your own so that it creates the necessary conditions for overcoming all problems and, despite the presence of the state border, strengthens the pineapple from the inside as a single whole I am a tree. not for that you fought the Nazis defending our common homeland so that today’s non-Nazis seized power in Ukraine you swore allegiance to the Ukrainian people they are anti-people bags that rob Ukraine and mock this all peoples do not fulfill its criminal I urge you to immediately lay down your arms and go home I will explain to all military personnel who fulfill this requirement will be able to freely leave the war zone and return to their families once again persistently emphasizes all responsibility for possible bloodshed entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine Now a few very important words for those who may be tempted to intervene in the current event Whoever tries to prevent the regulations from creating more threats for our country for our people should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history We are ready for any development with all the necessary decisions in this regard have been made, I hope that I will hear.

Then when I was coming of age yet again into high school 2008 happened. I saw a lot of friends and family lose their houses, jobs, cars, literally go homeless. I had one friend and his family. He said ""We're moving to Florida!"" like he was happy and he didn't seem to know his dad was moving his family down there not because he found a new job, but because it's warm.. And if you're homeless you at least need to not be in -20* in winter. 

Then everything that's happened since. My whole life has been bullshit. I don't know any good times. My parents talk about how crazy shit is now and how much better it use to be. I'm like great, I'm glad you lived in a utopia while I'm growing up in a fucking apocalypse here. 

When I first got my license, gas was $4.20 a gallon. It's almost the same right now. My parents, accounted for inflation, paid like 80c a gallon when they first got their licenses. Their first cars accounted for inflation costed like $500. And they were NOT beaters. I'm talking 8 year old cars with 40k miles. My dad's first car he bought at 15 with his PAPER route. It was a 70 chevy nova. My first car was a 20 year old chevy that had no heat, everything busted to shit, rusting, and I bought it for $1,500 and thought that was a fucking steal.

Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were destroyed near Mykolaivka as a result of a failed counterattack.

   
Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers were defeated at Nikolayevka.

Ukrainian units attempted to storm the settlement of Nikolaevka, not far from Luhansk, sending significant forces and armored vehicles into the region. It is known that the Ukrainian troops managed to successfully break through the defense line and almost approach the settlement of Nikolaevka, however, the units of the Lugansk People's Republic activated the Grad MLRS (sources report 80 attacks - ed.), after which Ukrainian large-caliber artillery units of the forces of the Luhansk People's Republic began to work, which made it possible not only to thwart the attack, but also to destroy the enemy forces, which turned out to be surrounded.

At the moment, there is information that the losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the assault on Nikolaevka may amount to several hundred servicemen, not to mention the loss of military equipment. Data on losses have not yet received any official information, however, according to some unofficial information, up to 250 Ukrainian servicemen participated in the attack, which were subsequently covered by artillery strikes, surrounded and completely destroyed.

The reason for the offensive in this direction is the attempt of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to seize control of the Seversky Donets River, which would allow the Ukrainian Armed Forces to initiate a large-scale advance into the territory of the LPR to encircle the forces of the Republic of Donbass and take control of the border with Russia.

Ukraine is just the first indicator that our citizens are checked out mentally and Biden knows it would be political suicide to declare a massive war effort. However he is damned either way.

To ask you to elaborate on your original point, why would you think that Trump's dwindling support makes pro-Ukraine demonstrations unlikely in the US? What did you mean by that?",False,1645671427.0,t3_szyfuw,t1_hy6sun7,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Except you didn't reword my comment, you said I claimed or implied that you shouldn't express your thoughts on this subject at all. I didn't. (that's called putting words in someone's mouth.) I said the particular thought you expressed was a waste of time for everyone.

>The situation in Ukraine right now will have larger consequences later.

Yes, but you were trying to explain how the next US presidential election is relevant to the present situation, remember? Not the reverse. You can definitely bring this up during the next presidential election - that makes sense. On the other hand, bringing up the next election because it's relevant to this matter right now does not.

>I'm saying good luck because a very important (unfortunately) person is directly contradicting the general consensus.

And my question again would be, has it seemed to you that Trump's opposition to various causes has diminished public demonstrations in support of those causes? If anything he has the opposite effect.

Your premise also assumes that republicans who have been swayed by Trump's russia love would have been organizing or participating pro-Ukraine protests if not for his influence, which I also don't buy.

See how discussion works when you don't immediately declare it impossible based on initial agreement? I just think ""oh, but the qultists disagree"" is such a lazy comment that adds nothing to the discussion and could literally be copy-pasted into the comments of any story about anything. And by constantly worrying about their random ideological convulsions you actually increase their power (at least in the minds of those who hear you).

Again, the truth is that people organizing pro-Ukraine demos shouldn't care what qultists think. If you were one of those organizers, how would their opposition change your plans? I know I wouldn't waste time worrying about it.",False,1645672870.0,t3_szyfuw,t1_hy6u9dj,,5,2,0,2,0,0,
