Day 50 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Russia is throwing a tantrum right now after their shiny toy was destroyed, they are launching their missiles at targets all over Ukraine and especially on Kyiv, but it‚Äôs actually pretty quiet here in Kharkiv. This is so fucking funny, holy shit, Russians are just fuming, they are so mad, yeah how dare we attack them?!

This is exactly what we need right now, Russian pride needs to be completely destroyed. There are so many Russians saying ‚Äúkill all Khohols (slur word for Ukrainians)‚Äù and ‚Äúnuke Kyiv‚Äù it‚Äôs just insane. I have no idea why they hate us so much, but that will be their undoing.

Also the sheer symbolism is just great, you know what date it is today? Today it‚Äôs the 110 years anniversary of Titanic‚Äôs sinking. It‚Äôs the perfect date for a ship literally called ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù, their pride, to sink. Their lead propagandists are losing their mind over it. They are even saying that they need to declare war on Ukraine, oh the horror, what will we do now? It's not like there's been a war going on here for 50 days, right?

Interesting reply in the thread:

>	I wouldn't understate the importance of tactics. The weather was reportedly stormy at the time. The Neptune is a sea-skimming cruise missile, so its radar profile was likely hard to distinguish from the wavetops. Using the storm to disguise the missiles would be pretty smart.

>	Exploiting the enemy's weakness too: reportedly the radar on the Moscow can/could only see 180 degrees. Reportedly, the Ukrainians distracted the Moscow with a drone and hit the ship on the blind side.

How did it happen? Rob Lee says the Ukrainians distracted it with a TB2 Bayraktar drone, and while the Moskva was trying to shoot down the drone, it was hit with two anti-ship Neptune missiles. These Neptune missiles are not aid from other countries - they were developed by Ukraine and only just deployed last month.

What happened to the Moskva? Russia says it caught on fire and some ammunition went off, but all crew were evacuated. My question is how many hundreds of feet were they evacuated into the air? The Moskva is a missile cruiser. It is completely packed with explosives. If you look at a picture, you will see giant tubes on the outside of the ship. These are 16 x P-500 Bazalt ASMs, each 10,000 pounds and designed to take out a ship. That is 160,000 pounds of munitions exposed on the deck of the ship. It also has 64 x S-300 SAM missiles, each designed to take out a plane. It doesn't take many of those going off before they all go off. Multiple sources from Russia have reported it has now sank.

What does it mean for the war? There is a strong probability the admiral of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is dead. This Moskva won't be able to bombard Mariupol or Odesa. Other Russian ships will be much more cautious in bombarding Ukrainian cities now. Because the Moskva was a mobile SAM air defense platform, Ukrainians will be safer flying sorties in this area. The sinking of the flagship with a crew of 500 will be difficult for Putin to hide or put a positive spin on. Moskva - the Russian spelling of Moscow - was literally blown up by the Ukrainians *who do not even have a navy of their own.* Expect Russian retaliation on those least able to defend themselves.

So, basically there is nothing the Russian Navy can replace it with, not only because Turkey is blocking the straits, but also because the Russian Navy doesn't have the capability to replace it with a new ship. They can't rebuild the Slava-class ships because all of them were built in Ukraine!

US President Joe Biden's administration¬†is expanding its intelligence sharing with Ukraine to allow more information on Russian activities in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to be shared, as the US believes that Russia is¬†shifting its strategy¬†to concentrate on the south and the east, according to US officials and another source familiar with the matter.

New guidelines, put in place over the past several weeks, have loosened rules for intelligence sharing, specifically in regions that were under Russian control prior to the 2022 invasion.¬†

‚ÄúWith the shift in Russia‚Äôs military efforts in southern and eastern Ukraine, we modified our guidelines to provide operators added clarity to enable intelligence sharing with Ukraine to defend themselves in what is sure to be a dynamic battle space,‚Äù a US intelligence official told CNN.¬†

Meanwhile a crazed Russian dictator and his incompetently evil army swing dementedly between horrendous war crimes a la Nazi Germany and pure black comedy as they fuck up every single aspect of their invasion through sheer hubris, idiocy and corruption. They get themselves sanctioned back into the stone age, go to Chernobyl and dig up the goddamn Red Forest for basically no reason, get told to fuck off by sassy grandmothers who intermittently down drones with jars of pickled food, drive tanks into rivers and upsidedown off trucks, lug in their victory parade uniforms instead of ammunition or food, send equipment to be blown up in exactly the same spot fifteen times in a row, get multiple generals shot in the face or run over by their own tanks while screaming at underlings and other endless insanity. They even lose their main flagship to a country with no fucking navy because they get distracted by a drone flying past and are apparently incapable of concentrating on two things at once, akin to a dog with three brain cells leaping at squirrels.

**What we know so far about about the damaged Russian ship**

Russia's defence ministry said that an explosion aboard Moskva, the flagship of the country's Black Sea Fleet, has ""seriously damaged"" the vessel.  
  
The ministry's statement said: ""The cruiser Moskva's ammunition has detonated as a result of a fire on the warship.  
  
""The vessel is seriously damaged. The entire crew have been evacuated. The cause of the blaze is being investigated.""  
  
It did not specify the cause of the fire, saying it was under investigation.  
  
Ukraine said the 186m-long vessel was struck by their Neptune missiles.  
  
Ukrainian presidential aide Oleksiy Arestovych said Russian rescuers were unable to reach the vessel, which could have had as many as 510 crew members on board.  
  
""It has been confirmed that the missile cruiser Moskva today went exactly where it was sent by our border guards on Snake Island!"" Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko wrote in his Telegram post.  
  
Earlier in the war, Ukrainians stationed on Snake Island in the Black Sea defied an order from the ship to surrender, telling the Moskva to ""go to hell"".  
  
What is known about the flagship?  
  
The Moskva missile cruiser was constructed in the early 1980s in what was then the USSR.  
  
It was the lead ship of the Soviet navy's Project 1164 Atlant class. It was initially called Slava, but later renamed Moskva (Moscow).  
  
The warship's main armaments are P-1000 Vulkan anti-ship missiles.  
  
The cruiser - which became the flagship of the Black Sea Fleet in 2000 - played a key role during Russia's military campaign in Syria, which began in 2015.",False,1649913406.0,t3_u38mps,t3_u38mps,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

**Warship attack has symbolic and military value, says professor:**

  
Prof Michael Petersen, director of the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the US Naval War College, has been speaking to Radio 4's Today programme about the news that Russian vessel the Moskva has been seriously damaged.  
  
He says it's still too early to know exactly what happened but ""it really does increasingly look like the Ukrainians have managed to pull off a not-insignificant victory at sea"".  
  
""I think it's one that has symbolic and military value as well,"" he explains.  
  
""This is the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, and it's getting a bit long in the tooth but it is the symbol of Russian naval power in the Black Sea.""  
  
He says that the Ukrainians lost most of their navy to the Russians in the initial invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014, so ""this is important symbolically because after all of that, they are still able to strike at Russian military power in ways that will really hurt back in Moscow"".  
  
He adds it may have ""important military value as well"" as the ""Russian navy may feel obligated to operate further off-shore now than they were previously"".  
  
""That may affect its ability to provide direct fire support to troops ashore and it might hinder their ability to provide air defence in coastal regions... I do think it will make the Russian navy think twice.""",False,1649919670.0,t3_u38mps,t3_u38mps,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Found the apex source, it's a guy named [Leonid Nevzlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Nevzlin). Not a verified account, but likely his account. Nobody was making fake Twitter accounts in 2009 in preparation for a war in 2022. 

https://twitter.com/Nevzlin/status/1514494028368302080

> Update from my sources in Moscow: 1. Shoigu is out of the game, he may become disabled if he survives. He suddenly had a massive heart attack, he is in intensive care, connected to the devices. Rumor has it that the heart attack could not have occurred from natural causes.

Note, this is a rumor from a rumor.  Not confirmed even slightly. 

What's more credible is that Nevzlin says that [Arkady Dvorkovich's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Dvorkovich) wife has fled to Dubai, where Nevzlin is presumably a primary source for that. He also says Dvorkovich is under house arrest. I suspect the wife is the person who passed on this information to Nevzlin, but she's probably not a super reliable source. 

Should be noted that Dvorkovich is the highest ranking Russian who's condemned the war, as far as I know.

From CNN's Olga Voitovych in Lviv

A Ukraine special-operations unit destroyed a bridge as a Russian convoy crossed it while it headed toward¬†Izium in southeastern Kharkiv region, the Command of the Special Operations Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine claimed in a statement Thursday.

Ukrainian officials have reported heavy fighting in the vicinity of Izium in recent days, saying that Russian forces are trying to reach the eastern¬†Donbas region from the direction of the town.

The statement claimed that the Ukrainian unit destroyed the bridge with an explosive charge as a convoy of a¬†Tiger armored vehicle and several trucks crossed it.

CNN could not independently verify the claim. Ukrainian forces destroyed a key bridge in the Kyiv region to slow the advance of Russian forces in the opening days of the war.

Some background:¬†On Wednesday,¬†a CNN team witnessed intense shelling¬†of the residential district of Saltivka, in northeastern Kharkiv, with a local official saying they believed Russia was stepping up attacks¬†amid a new phase of military operations in the region.

Ukrainian officials have warned for days that they expect a major offensive push by Russian forces in the neighboring eastern Donbas region, as Russia repositions troops and equipment following a failed push to take Kyiv, the capital.",False,1649932160.0,t3_u38mps,t3_u38mps,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

If the Ukrainian Army can retake Kherson, and then push to the isthmus linking Crimea to the mainland, that will put Sebastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet contained therein, within range of, potentially, multiple Ukrainian heavy weapons systems, including Tochka-U, Vilkha (Alder tree) 300mm GMLRS, and any remaining Neptune missiles. This would compel the Russians to withdraw the remaining ships to Novorossiysk, functionally removing them from combat operations, or risking their destruction.

The withdrawal of Russian surface combatants from Sebastopol would remove significant combat power, and prove catastrophic for Russian morale in the South.

Title: The Ukraine war is the final act of a long Soviet collapse  
He concludes as follows, after a long historic analysis of Russia's geopolitial policy over the last 3 decades.  
""The start of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is a clear exception to the trend towards a more rational, risk-averse and pragmatic approach to the post-Soviet space. It seems that in the eyes of the Kremlin leadership, a western-oriented Ukraine working closely with NATO posed a serious challenge not only to Russia's security interests but even to Russia's very existence. Any rational cost-benefit analysis would suggest that Moscow has much to lose but not much to gain by attempting to transform Ukraine by military means. It would be premature to examine the outcome of this move by the Kremlin in Ukraine. But one can speculate  
The paradoxical outcome of Russian foreign policy over the past 30 years is that the country has managed to become a very active global power without being a legitimate regional leader. Moreover, Russian globalism in recent years can be seen as a kind of political recompense for the many mistakes Moscow has made in its attempts to build constructive and stable relations with many of its closest neighbors. Nevertheless, the task of developing such relations will sooner or later reappear at the top of Moscow's list of foreign policy priorities. True, this will be much more difficult now than it was in 1991. Still, if this critical issue is not addressed, any success of Russian foreign policy in any other area will inevitably be devalued.""",False,1649909516.0,t3_u38mps,t3_u38mps,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

The document accused NATO of trying to pressure Ukraine to ‚Äúabandon‚Äù sputtering and so far unsuccessful negotiations with Russia, ‚Äúin order to continue the bloodshed.‚Äù Washington, it said, was pressuring other countries to stop any military and technical cooperation with Russia, and was pressuring those with Soviet-era weapons to transfer them to Ukraine.

Once Ukraine gets Kherson taken back, the canal which supplies most of Crimea's fresh water is not going to be turned on. Crimea has been drying up since 2014, when Ukraine turned off the tap, and Crimea will return to arid steppe - which it was before the canal was built in 1950. 

Crimea has been drying up for years. It's a serious problem. (You can  google ""Crimea drying up"")  Putin was aware of this and visited Crimea a few years back. Getting the canal running again was likely one of the goals of the invasion. Once it was obvious Kiev and all of Ukraine wasn't going to be captured, getting the canal open probably became closer to a primary objective.

If Ukraine blows up the Crimean Bridge, which connects Crimea to Russia eastwards, life in Crimea is going to be miserable. There's already very limited water. With the bridge it was extremely expensive to truck in water. If Russia has to ferry in water, it's going to be even worse. Other supplies will be constrained too. Keeping Crimea viable will get expensive.

Once the war in mainland Ukraine ends, sanctions will likely still exist on Russia. Russia's economy will stumble. Crimea will become a burden for a strained economy.

Lifting the sanctions on Russia will probably be dependent on Russia returning Crimea to Ukraine. Crimea will turn to shit. Russia's economy will turn to shit. Russia won't be able to tap the resources of the contested region. At some point, Russia will have to ask if it's really worth it.

Payment for Russian gas in roubles by European Union buyers as demanded by President Vladimir Putin would break the EU's sanctions regime against Moscow, an internal European Commission note said.

Putin has warned Europe it risks having gas supplies cut unless it pays in the Russian currency as he seeks retaliation over Western sanctions for Moscow's invasion of¬†Ukraine.

In March, Moscow proposed that energy buyers open accounts at Gazprombank, where payments in euros or dollars would be converted to roubles.

The European Commission's note, making clear it is technical, preliminary, and based on an unofficial translation of the Russian Presidential Decree of March 31, said the law added several new layers of obligations on EU gas buyers, taking the effective completion of the purchase out of their hands.

Mr. Biden on Wednesday announced $800 million in additional security assistance for Ukraine, including artillery, armored personnel carriers, and Humvees, bringing total military aid committed to Ukraine since he took office to more than $3 billion. The new package includes heavier weaponry than the U.S. previously had provided and‚Äîfor the first time‚ÄîAmerican-made artillery pieces.

¬´Humans with machine guns keep my peace

Humans with machine guns want something good.

So that I can work and feed my family

So that the children can laugh in the yard

Humans with machine guns were given them by someone

To prevent terror and crime

From another humans with machine guns if anything happens.

And the ""right-wingers"" are out for blood

Teenagers are at raves

And they're so on drugs 

They're all going to school the day after tomorrow

They'll all be looking for a job in a year's time

But none of that may ever happen

Depends on how you spend your Saturday

Some of the survivors will get their daddy off their backs

And some will have to go to the recruiting office with their things.

In the barracks - chill out, on the parade ground - party

Dance till you drop, dust under your boots

Many adequate Russians began to attempt to ""decolonize themselves,"" and first and foremost this began to manifest itself in language.

One of the most noticeable things: how often people began to correct each other when pronouncing certain words or things related to Ukraine or Belarus. We literally correct pronunciation in the Ukrainian manner, according to the norms of the Ukrainian language. Everywhere, interest in the Ukrainian language and culture has increased, and everyone has gone deeper into researching ""uncomfortable"" facts from our history. And there are, of course, quite a lot of them and they are terrible (as probably any empire that conquered colonies and oppressed the local population).

Surely you've noticed that there's a bot on reddit that corrects the spelling of the city of Kyiv? There are a lot of such things in the Russian language. I have a friend who is a Belarusian who has lived in Moscow for several years now, and I suddenly realized that all this time I was regularly correcting him politely when he made some grammatical mistakes. Now I am terribly embarrassed. 

The main difficulty in this situation is that Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian are very close, although not identical. Personally, I understand about 80% of Ukrainian speech and text, and about 90% of the Belarusian. People often use the same words and constructions that are used in literary Russian, adding to them the wording of their native language, as if mixing Russian and their national language - in the end, you get confused and begin to correct him, and he feels that his national language is ugly or provincial. 

I still don't understand how to get out of it: I persuade dude to speak in his native language, but he refuses, because he says that Russian is closer to him and he understands it better. His mother is a Belarusian who hates Belarusian and didn't teach him to speak it at home (although she herself taught it at school in the USSR), his father is about the same.

Following the Russian attack on Georgia in 2008, America‚Äôs president, Barack Obama, rushed to ‚Äúreset‚Äù relations and focus on nation-building at home. When Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons in 2013, Mr Obama backed off. After annexing Crimea in 2014, Russia got a slap on the wrist.

China and Russia argue that this lack of self-belief is a sign of Western decadence. If so, it spread under Donald Trump, who held America‚Äôs allies in contempt and was wholly transactional. Democracy in America sank further into outrage and conspiracy. The European Union often seemed hopelessly self-absorbed. Brexit, whether you were for or against it, was a fiasco.

Poorer countries also see America and its allies as self-serving, because they demand solidarity when it suits them and turn their backs when it does not. While Russia and China released covid-19 vaccines abroad, the West hoarded huge stocks. Countries that grew rich by burning oil and coal have urged a global effort to limit climate change, but failed to keep their (limited) promises to help finance poorer countries‚Äô plans to abandon fossil fuels and adapt to a warmer world.

And poorer countries see the West as hypocritical. Europe talks about universal rights, but its laudable welcome for millions of refugees from the war in Ukraine has been undercut by its rejection of refugees from the war in Syria. America and its closest allies invaded Iraq in 2003 without un backing. In Western eyes, and The Economist‚Äôs, Saddam Hussein was a murderous dictator who had used nerve gas on his own people and attacked his neighbours. He could not be more different from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine‚Äôs elected president. Yet the rulers of other countries worry that if the West is free to act as judge, jury and executioner, they will get summary justice.

This is a poisonous cocktail of legitimate grievances and exaggeration, all laced with a lingering resentment of colonialism. The pity is that emerging countries are making a grave error. As sovereign powers, they too have a stake in the war. All the West‚Äôs faults do not outweigh the fact that, in the system Mr Putin is offering, their people would suffer terribly.

The reason is that the world Mr Putin desires would be far more decadent, self-serving and amoral than the one that exists today. Ukraine shows how. His extravagant lies about Nazis in Kyiv and his denial that Russia is even fighting a war are decadent. His brazen claim that nato provoked the war, posing an intolerable threat to Russia by expanding into central and eastern Europe is self-serving. Those countries were not swallowed up: they chose to join nato for their own protection after decades of Soviet tyranny. And witness the drowning of all morality in his armies‚Äô unconscionable use of torture, rape and mass murder as the routine tools of war.

What is more, Mr Putin‚Äôs belief in the dominance of great powers will not be limited to the battlefield. For he is right that, ultimately, the successful use of force underpins the structure of geopolitics. If Russia is allowed to prevail in Ukraine, bullying, lying and manipulation will further permeate trade, treaties and international law‚Äîthe whole panoply of arrangements that are so easily taken for granted, but which keep the world turning.

so Russia's deployed nukes have 1550 warheads, and in total they have ~6000, right. and their yearly spending on it is around 8 billion dollars. people have pointed out that this is, weirdly, around the same as the UK spends for a fraction of that.

1. anyone have a good idea how? how does this in any way check out? idk much about what goes into maintenance so there may be a proper reason for it, but it's just really hard to wrap my mind around the disparity in numbers here. especially since Russia does (allegedly) try to modernise and add to their capability. they prob wouldn't need US numbers, but it just feels like so little. (and that's not even considering potential embezzlement.) this isn't supposed to be a ""haha what if their nukes don't work"" and more so a ""how on earth are they this cost-effective, how many corners can you cut, is everyone else just doing way too much?""

2. if, for some weird reason, China suddenly went back on their policy and declared war on everyone ‚Ä¶ would 350 warheads actually count as first strike effective when faced with the combined ~2k deployed nukes from NATO? I realise one is one too many, and MAD may still be a thing, but that just sounds like it'd be an overall loss that's simply not worth it ‚Ä¶? there's a lot of big cities and military facilities to target, after all. (yes this is a thinly veiled way to ask if it would be viable if Russia has way less, and no I do not want to find out, I just have a lot of thoughts going back and forth and keep thinking back to an offhand comment some journalist made once about first strike capability)

sorry for the long potentially off-topic post and questions I doubt anyone has a real answer to, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this since I've never rly thought about these things before so it just has me going kinda ??? and maybe someone here has looked into these sorts of things more than I have. ~~and feel free to downvote this or whatever tbh I still don't rly get how reddit works I'm not even sure how I ended up on this sub~~",False,1649933622.0,t3_u38mps,t3_u38mps,,0,-5,0,-5,0,0,

This wasn't a naval conflict a la Midway or even the Falklands.

The Moskva wasn't even launching missiles at land targets.

They were mostly using it for antiaircraft protection for ships in the Black Sea, and to periodically pretend to storm Odessa.

https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2022/04/russias-most-powerful-warship-in-the-black-sea-is-operating-in-a-pattern/

""From March 2 Russian warships began conducting intimidation missions close to Odesa. And they were possibly involved in a number of attacks on merchant ships, effectively creating a blockade. We have not seen any evidence that Moskva took an active part. Instead she remained further offshore.

An older warship, Moskva is not armed with land attack cruise missiles. The Kalibr missile, analogous to the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Tomahawk, came later. So unlike other ship types she has not played a direct role in the period barrage of cruise missiles launched against Ukraine.""

""As the war progressed the Russian Navy began conducting large-scale amphibious demonstrations. This involved sailing around six landing ships towards Odesa as if to conduct an assault. But then diverting at the last moment. These exercises tie up Ukrainian forces and act as a deception.

Moskva has been observed in both of the main documented examples of this. First on March 15 and then on March 30. There may be other unseen occasions. Here Moskva was surrounded by other warships or again, providing area protection from a position further out. It is intuitive that Moskva has played a command role in these operations.""

... if I had to guess from what little I know, it probably has something to do with Russia's own historical/cultural insecurities. They keep emphasizing (accurately or not) that ""Ukraine"" originally meant ""borderland."" Well, in many ways, Russia historically was *Europe's* borderland, always struggling to catch up, always trying to prove themselves. Even though this hasn't been the case for decades, I think this internalized sense of inferiority subconsciously influences a lot of what they do, resulting in the inflated, desperate sense of cultural superiority they seem to be clinging to.

To put it another way, they seem to me to be projecting a lot of their own perceived flaws onto you/Ukrainians in general. Everything they don't like about themselves, they throw onto you. I guess at some point, they decided that Ukrainians were the ones they could always safely feel superior to, no matter what. The idea that you might've changed, or worse yet, might even have *surpassed* them in some ways? That utterly *enrages* them. Since without that, all those insecurities come back to rest where they originated - on them.

Like if you want to take the Baltics for comparison, the population of Ukraine is larger than Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania‚Ä¶ combined. 

The miscalculation was that Ukraine was not perceived to have a capable modern military, and that their governance had become corrupted enough by Russian operations to collapse in the event of a war. That was generally true in 2014, and I think in hindsight Putin probably has large regrets that he didn‚Äôt take more decisive action then.

Since then Ukraine was significantly hardened as a target with modern anti-armor and other weapons, combat experience, unification of its people against Russia, etc. and it has turned out that the FSB‚Äôs buy offs of Ukrainian leaders was significantly overstated.

This isn't to diminish Ukraine's remarkable military accomplishments or make excuses for Russia's piss poor and heinous behavior, or to suggest what Ukraine is doing is morally wrong, but Zelenskyy himself along with many others within his government have backgrounds in entertainment, and they're very skilled in crafting effective narratives for domestic, Russian, and Western consumption.  

All kinds of outright bizarre, stranger than fiction events take place in every war, but the Ukrainians in charge know exactly how to frame and amplify those events, especially through social media, in ways that bolster their reputation while demoralizing the enemy. Meanwhile, Russia's leadership had largely bought into their own pre-war propaganda of a weak and divided Ukraine, and were caught completely flat footed when their own narratives were bluntly refuted time and again by both reality and opposing messages coming out of the country. Even now they don't really have a better plan besides repeatedly doubling down on their old messages, which only makes them look more foolish.  

There is a very good reason why you've probably heard about the sunflower seed babushka or the defiance at Snake Island, events which have become legend through endless repetition, and why Ukraine would do things like let their prisoners of wall call home, and even set up a hotline for Russians to find out what happened to their sons and husbands. It clearly paints Ukrainians as heroic defenders fighting against an enemy that is at once evil and incompetent. The Russian military is both those things, don't get me wrong, but you're certainly hearing about it way more than any other army fighting around the world right now that's just as evil or incompetent.

Russia in 1990 believed in democracy and the West, then got a very bad decade. Putin got lucky that he came to power in 2000 as [oil prices started rising](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart), so there was a big increase in Russia's revenue and well-being, which let him convince everyone that his rule works better than Western-inspired rule.

At the same time, many countries near Russia were joining NATO, because they'd been part of the Russian Empire / USSR / Warsaw Pact and didn't want a repeat. So ""NATO eastward expansion"" became another rallying point of anti-Westernism.

As to sanctions, Russians know that sanctions against them are led by the West, so this becomes another rallying point.",1649975352.0,1649972988.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4r2da0,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Armor, artillery, and a lot of APC's and IFV's (the last two now feature tons of even older models than the ones they've been using so far). They are planning a **big** offensive in Donbas. Against the most ATGM saturated battlefield that has ever existed. For anyone who's into military history, this literally looks like the battle of Kursk 2.0 ramping up preparations. The problem for the germans at Kursk was that there was no way to hide preparations. When they finally crossed the starting line, it was an immense tank army, featuring lots of the most modern and best tanks that existed. Heavily armored beasts. But they were attacking. And the defenders knew they were coming and had prepared a defence in depth, where the major player for the russians was layered antitank gun emplacements that channeled the attack into line after line of killing zones. The Ukrainians are going to be playing the role of the defenders at Kursk. They already have deep defence lines that are much better prepared than the ones in Kursk. They have prepared them for 8 years. The role of the anti-tank guns will be played by ground troops in small units with Javelins, NLAWS, LAWs, Stugna-P's, Panzerfaust 4's and a variety of other ATGM's. In the thousands. Not to mention overhead drones and now even loitering munitions that will surely be looking for command and communication vehicles.The Russians are heading in with their prone-to-cook-off MBT's and lots and lots of APC's, IFV's and other troop carriers. And they will try to use mass artillery. The problem for Russia is that their particular style of artillery was made to counter large armounts of enemy armor and armored vehicles, and large infantry formations. And Ukraine doesnt fight like that. Small units, spread out and stinging you wherever you are vulnerable. You cant deal with that with saturation artillery, nor mass armor breakthroughs. You would need to screen the advance with infantry. Lots of infantry. And if there's one thing we learned over the last 6 weeks, its that Russia doesnt know how to do that. They abandoned the idea of foot soldiers working with their armor. Ukraine has access to **better** field overview and intel than Russia has. They know *exactly* whats coming, and they'll know *when* it is coming.

b7e7f05dadc6e5b4034e45cc72754535,u38mps,i4q86jd,">Why does China care so much? It's Russia, not China, that is being sanctioned.

A few reasons.

The first is that sanctions aren't just a boycott by one party against another. It's legal restrictions on doing business with sanctioned entities that come with legal penalties. A hypothetical; 20 years ago, a US heavy equipment manufacturer like John Deere decides they want to buy into the hype of offshoring for cheap labor costs for some kind of replacement part for big tractors. Cautious of their intellectual property being stolen, and due to the complexity of the part, they can't just order these cogs from a catalogue, nor are they willing to send the detailed specs over to some factory that will start producing more than they ordered to sell gray market parts on their own, undercutting the business. They decide they should invest in their own factory.

Per Chinese regulations, they need a local business partner in China for a joint venture to own 50%. So they find a partner to build, setup, and operate the facility, staff it locally, and start producing the part. They ship it to tractor customers all over the world. Fortunately for the Chinese partner, it turns out that this cog for tractors actually has dual use for military equipment, and they start doing a brisk supplemental business exporting it to a Russian defense contractor that maintains armored infantry vehicles.

Then sanctions roll in, and of course, that Russian defense contractor is a sanctioned entity. American and European companies are prohibited from doing business with them. Because of John Deere's ownership stake in the factory, that includes them. They won't permit that export. So the Chinese partner has to make a decision - separate from the joint venture to continue supplying to the Russian defense contractor, or stop. Plus, if they continue to do business with the Russians clandestinely, then the next time they go on vacation to Europe or the US or Australia, they might find themselves in handcuffs.

There are no good options for this one factory owner. They risk incur either a large flight of capital/knowhow, or they have to shut down production lines and fire workers. The town that depends on this factory gets thrown into recession, with idle and angry workers roaming the streets wondering why they haven't gotten all the social support from the CCP they've been promised all their lives. 

Now multiply that by thousands of factories, and China has a real economic and social problem to contend with.

&#x200B;

The second is that it's in China's interests to be indignant about harsh sanctions being applied as a tool to stop or punish a country from seeking to bolster their national security interests. Like all countries, China has strategic needs and the sovereign right to pursue them. For example, they have border conflicts with India. They have maritime conflicts in the South China Sea. They have strategic concerns about North Korean stability on their northeastern border. They have a governance dispute with Taiwan. Etc.

What they worry about is that their biggest trading partners (US, Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia) might unilaterally decide that those strategic needs are invalid, and punish China with sanctions or embargo for ever acting to secure them. Imagine a scenario where an election (or even coup) in Taiwan installs a pseudo-fascist, militaristic leader who is vehemently anti-China, and starts using state security services or special forces to sabotage Chinese naval or merchant ships, or cyberattacks, or worse. China might decide that they have no choice but to remove that government, diplomacy having failed to stop their greatest fears from being realized (a heavily armed, hostile island within missile striking distance of their coastal population centers). If they act, as they feel is their right, they don't want to be economically obliterated for it.

They may not agree with Russia's decision to invade Ukraine, but what they see is a sovereign nation asserting a national security concern and acting on it, and wish to support the legitimacy of *that* right.

&#x200B;

The last reason (though I'm sure there are others) is that China is generally not psyched about the broader economic fallout. Russia's economy is going to contract 10% this year. Western countries are teetering towards recession. All of that is bad news for the export of Chinese goods, the lifeblood of their economy. Or foreign capital inflows into Chinese investments (if the stock market crashes, where would people put their money for safety? US bonds, not speculative Chinese investments). They've already got a real estate sector facing a liquidity crisis, and this will NOT help. So they'd like to see this resolved sooner rather than later, to contain the bad news.",False,1649958659.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4pwmgc,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

It's a pretty common thing to do. It's more necessary for Russia and Ukraine to use distinctive markings because unlike the US and its usual adversaries, both sides are using many of the same vehicles, leading to a much higher chance of incorrect ID. That video of the soldiers being blown up by the tank next to them, that's a good example of the consequences.

Also, camo does not make your vehicles invisible. You can hear and feel a tank even if you can't see it, they stick out from the air, and they're quite large.

No, camouflage paint isn't about invisibility, it's about breaking up the outline so you can't see what you're looking at as easily. Look at naval Dazzle Pattern Camouflage. You're not hiding a ship but it makes it harder to judge distance and direction of travel. That's the aim.

Tsarist Russia was considered a world power with a world-class Navy. Japan in contrast, just finished upgrading from Sword-wielding Samurai and were playing with guns for the first time on a mass scale (no joke. See the Meiji Revolution). The Samurai system was still fresh in Japanese minds (and indeed: many prominent Japanese politicians were former Samurai).

The world was expecting to see Japan roll over against the world power. Turns out Japan really did learn how to use guns, modern military tactics, and had all sorts of old British Ships (Japan saw Britain as ""another historically important island"", and felt like British equipment would go well with what they needed to do).

Long story short, Russia gets their asses handed to them. Japan + British relations improved, but Japan kinda let Russo-Japanese war get to their heads (Japan would take the ""lessons"" of 1904 well into the 1930s and 1940s. Japan saw itself as a world-power after they defeated Russia)

In a theoretical, purist sense... absolutely yes.  Both Japan and Germany had many similar characteristics in their culture leading up to and during WW2: extreme nationalism; racism or superiority complex; messianic complex; delusions of grandeur and a focus on conquest.  Both Japan and Germany are wildly different today.

I imagine it would be similarly possible to reform Russian culture...

... in theory.

In practice, unfortunately no.  Best we can do is cut them off from the entire world and let them fester in their own mess.  Just like with Japan and Germany, this sort of reform would require absolute and unconditional surrender of Russia.  It would require *massive* reeducation and major restructuring of almost every aspect and every level of their society along with tons of economic assistance and development.  And it would very likely require twice the time of similar reforms in Germany and Japan.  Russia under a foreign control for *several* decades.

Furthermore, it might be better to hasten the disintegration of Russia into many countries rather than trying to fight to keep it all together.  Part of their entire problem and shtick is this centuries old focus on empire.",False,1649987148.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4s1vmw,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

1. Maintenance

Given what this war has reached us about the state of RUS heavy equipment, and how much of the defence budget has likely been pocketed by generals and oligarchs, it's not too far fetched that their nuclear arsenal simply isn't maintained to any meaningfull extent.

2. China's nuclear strategy

Chinas nuclear doctrine isn't the same af the US or Russia, their doctrine is instead to make any invasion of China too costly for the aggressor, and that doesn't require thousands of nukes.

So, the possible scenarios are: 

* It was sunk.
* It took on enough water to capsize and is now ""floating"" upside down, and will sink soon unless heroic efforts are taken to salvage it.
* The sinking was stopped by bulkheads but its interior was gutted by fire, and it will need to be rebuilt in drydock (though it is more likely to be scuttled).

These are the logical conclusions, because a captain does not order to abandon ship unless they believe that the crew cannot recover control of the ship.

A vessel hit by an anti-ship missile can be recovered... For example, the USS Stark was hit by an Exocet missile in 1987 (a missile slightly smaller than a Neptune).  It did not sink though because the captain acted quickly to flood the side of the ship that was not damaged by the missile strike, the sea was calm, and there were two other ships nearby who provided aid.  The Moskva had everything working against it in those respects, because it was alone in stormy seas; therefore it can safely be assumed that the Moskva sunk, or it is soon going to be scuttled.

What we know for sure about his day job right now is that he:

1. Acts as primary point of contact on the international stage, coordinating the effort to acquire weapons from friendly nations. This is no small feat. Both mass diplomacy and personal contact diplomacy with dozens of countries, coordinating with diplomats and media strategists and above all keeping abreast of what the army actually requires is a full time job in and of itself. While we see the daily calls and communications with western leaders, we don't see the daily briefings and reports from the military that tell him what he needs to be pressing for.

2. Coordinating Ukraine's resources. Armies run of their stomach, and this war has destroyed Ukraine's economy. That means very difficult decisions need to be made about how to finance the army, the civil state and make sure everyone has enough to eat. Who gets paid what? Does anyone get a pay cut? A pay deferral? What loans does Ukraine agree to? What services get axed? What revenue streams are waived and what are pursued? How do you persuade people to keep doing more for less? For example, he made the decision to stop collecting most business taxes during the war, so that businesses hit hard by the disruptions of the conflict could continue to keep vital private sector services running and civilian supply chains and administration intact. 

3. Coordinating civilian administrative changes in support of the war. This includes things that might seem obvious to us but actually require someone to do them: the embargo on Russia and Belarus; central bank and currency policy; tariffs and trade; confiscations of Russian property; and even the grim task of keeping track of military and civilian casualties and informing families and keeping track of economic losses. All of this has to be done by a civilian government and, as a democracy, this requires supervision by an elected head of government. That's him. 

4. Communicating with the civilian population and military to provide assurance and coordination for the sake of maintaining morale and commitment to the fight. This is no small task, and he's been doing it well.

So as you can imagine, Zelenskyy has a lot on his plate at the moment. A close following of the news will give examples of his involvement in all of the above.

You cannot easily replace a warship lost in a time of war if you're Russia in this case. The cost of the Moskva is the cost of a new Lider-class destroyer ship since that's what Russia was planning on replacing the Slava-class with.

The Lider- class doesn't even have a keel laid down yet, and was rumored to have been suspended by the Russian Navy due to COVID and cost over runs (with the public facing estimated cost of 100 million Roubles).

So, basically there is nothing the Russian Navy can replace it with, not only because Turkey is blocking the straits, but also because the Russian Navy doesn't have the capability to replace it with a new ship. They can't rebuild the Slava-class ships because all of them were built in Ukraine!

Panzers have a reputation in myth, but in reality they were unreliable and the most effective panzers were not king tigers or panthers but Panzer 3 and 4s. Germany had an obsession with tank destroyers and heavy tanks which were dead end concepts like the cruiser tank and whippet tanks.

Light tanks became IFVs, medium tanks turned into MBTs. Heavy tanks were a dead end but they got focus because it was ""cool"" and more ""super weapon"" worthy to the fuhrer.

German designers would even opt for ""marketable"" ideas to the military because it got them cushy high paying jobs even if those resources were necessary for equipment that worked. The V2 being a major example.

This myth further perpetuated after the war when German scientists would make up wacky shit like UFOs, super weapons, and other sort of conspiracy trash in order to be recruited by the west. The Horton brothers being a major example with their ""stealth bomber"" being a total urban myth perpetuated by the History channel.

German scientists were often peddling the same lies to the US for the same reason they did to Germany.

First, no one can ever be 100% sure of anything, ever. Modern news consumption is all about trusting the right sources and ignoring or discounting the untrustworthy sources. For example, I tend to trust independent journalists reporting on the war in Ukraine and distrust anything the Russian government says because Russia has a demonstrated history of lying. 

It's necessary to carefully choose which news sources you trust because you can't personally, physically verify the vast majority of the claims on a news website on any given day, even in peace time. That said, when you are trying to figure out whether a claim by a trusted source is true, Occam's Razor is an excellent starter heuristic: ""entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity."" In news consumption, that generally means that the simplest explanation that fits all of the known facts of a story is often the correct one.

Now, apply that principle to what we know about the Moskva--the ship was damaged near the Ukrainian coast and some of its ordinance exploded, causing further damage. The two explanations that best fit the facts are either (1) Ukraine, a country that is at war with Russia, fired anti-ship missiles that it is known to possess, and these missiles damaged the Moskva; or (2) Russia somehow damaged its own ship either through incompetence, negligence, or otherwise. Both of these explanations fit the facts as we currently know them. 

By contrast, the U.S. isn't at war with Russia, and has been extremely unwilling to send its forces to fight in the conflict. Adding the U.S. to any explanation of what happened to the Moskva unnecessarily multiplies the potential entities involved--a violation of Occam's Razor. As such, any accusation that the U.S. caused the damage should be subject to a higher burden of proof. And if such accusations come from an untrustworthy source who doesn't present any evidence, then the accusations can generally be dismissed out of hand.",False,1649956174.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4oegqj,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

That's why the slightest questioning or mocking of the authority is punished so viciously - if the powers that be are omnipotent enough to be able to crack down on someone for just making a joke or asking a question, then what will they do to anyone who actually resists?

Autocrats treat any attacks on their myths and their images as equivalent to physical attacks on themselves because, in a twisted way, they are just as dangerous.

A Western politician who is seen as weak or ineffective is either no-confidence-voted-out or allowed to lame-duck the remainder of his term, after which they live peacefully in retirement, occasionally popping up to receive campaign cash or make an appearance on a talk show.

Then when they get on TV, and say crazy ass shit, the loonies come out of the woodwork to donate. (or they get straw-donations, which is illegal, but apparently, nobody ever gets charged with this crime). The donations go to pay off the loan.  Any donations in excess of the cost of the campaign go directly into the pocket of the candidate as ""interest"" (and that's calculated after-the-fact). 

This is legal.

And so: political donors can literally put money into the pocket of the candidate who will become an elected official.  Not to fund the campaign, but as what's effectively a bribe. 

Best of all, the donors get to deduct the amount donated from their taxable income, so basically, it reduces the amount of tax they pay - so essentially taxpayers are paying the candidates (whether they agree with the ideology or not), but the donors get the benefit.

>On 20 February 2000, Sobchak died suddenly in the town of Svetlogorsk of the Kaliningrad Oblast. The initial suspected cause of death was a heart attack, but the findings of two medical experts were contradictory.[16][17] A criminal investigation of Sobchak's death as a possible ""premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances"" was opened only on 6 May 2000, more than two months later. After three months, the investigation was closed without a finding.[14][18] The Democratic Union party led by Valeria Novodvorskaya made an official statement that not only Sobchak, but also two of his aides had heart attacks simultaneously, which indicated poisoning.[19] Two other men were present with Sobchak during his death, but their names were not publicly disclosed.[17][20][21]

>According to an independent investigation by Arkady Vaksberg, both bodyguards of Sobchak were treated for symptoms of poisoning after Sobchak's death, indicating at a probable contract killing by poisoning.[14][22] Sobchak's widow Lyudmila had her own autopsy done on her husband's body, but never made the results public; she told the BBC that she keeps the findings in a secure location outside Russia.",False,1649985602.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4rsdev,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

A largenumber of ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars ‚Äî some put the total at140,000 ‚Äî have left the peninsula since 2014. Crimean Tatars complain ofintimidation and oppression as one reason for moving.

So a referendum along the lines of what you suggest (in an annexed territory controlled by Russia) would largely just reward Russian bad behavior in the annexation.

Just food for thought; there is no good solution here. One could move Crimea back to Ukrainian control, move back in the Tartars and others dispossessed by Russia, move out the Russian military occupation force, and THEN have a referendum.

You seem to have a flawed view of what democracy is and is not (or representative democracy, in the case of Ukraine).  A representative democracy is not run by referenda, although it may make use of referenda in legally defined scenarios.  Democracies that utilize referenda have rules that govern how a referendum is carried out, such as what types of decisions can be made by referendum, processes for calling a referendum, etc.  

If Crimea remains Ukrainian, the Crimeans who identify as russian will have a choice to make: either stay where they are and live as they have for as long as Crimea has been legally recognized as Ukrainian, or they can leave.

* its the flagship of the black sea fleet

it would be like the US military sinking the Yamato in 1942. hugely symbolic and motivating, even if the target wasn't quite the military threat envisioned.

 >The Winter War, also known as the First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. The war began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

Very anecdotal, but I saw this interview:

>French far-leftist Jean-Luc M√©lenchon on Sunday fell just short of advancing to the presidential run-off, leaving far-right flagbearer Marine Le Pen to challenge Emmanuel Macron again for France's top job. But among 18- to 25-year-olds it was M√©lenchon, 70, who won the night with 29 percent of their vote. What his supporters do next will be critical on April 24. FRANCE 24 met with students north of Paris who voted for M√©lenchon. None were keen to help re-elect Macron, even against the far right.

>""Macron or Le Pen, we're screwed in any case. For my first election, I'd hoped for better,"" mused Esteban, one hand in his pocket, the other resting against a V√©lib bike-share stand outside Paris 8-Saint-Denis University, north of the French capital. Voting in Sunday's first round, the 18-year-old cast his vote for M√©lenchon. ""It was the vote closest to my convictions. I'm not going to lie to you: It makes me lose hope in a better world, or at least one with more social progress,"" he lamented after his candidate's narrow defeat.

After the Soviet Union disbanded in the early 1990s, the ship passed on to Ukrainian control and assumed the name Ukraina. In 2010 the Ukrainian parliament stripped the ship of its name.

I am unfortunately not very hopeful. They always seem to keep the worst parts of the previous era when they go through a period of upheaval, with corruption and cronyism being the constant. 

The imperial era ended and a lot of potential lay in the years following the downing of the tyrant regime. Lenin however kept the structures of the Okrana and repression but slapped a red sticker on it in the guise of war communism. This led into Stalins accelleration of the trends and a worseing of the situation. Krutzhev tried to slowly reform but was deposed by party conservatives. 

When the USSR collapsed the system had undergone a rough period of change that sent everyone through the ringer. What is notable though is that the new system established in the Russian federation never really had any potential of success because of the people inhabiting that system. 

Through the Soviet era, corruption and cronyism, a factor also in the Romanov era, was made so much worse. Corruption on all levels and the rule of the apparatchiks and the party nomenklatura hardwired the people in the system to always work through political maneuvering and self enrichment, and it rewarded players skilled in such games. 

This is the system that spawned the mafia state and Putin's neo-fascist state.

That is the text in twitter.  I do not have the translation of the Russian. 

The circumstances are atrocious.  However, things to do when your country invades another include reading the fact that civilians are suffering into the congressional record.  Attempt to allocate funding to start repairing as much damage as you can.  That includes providing teachers for education while children are away from school in Ukraine.  These are resistance moves.  

Without more information there is no reason to believe this particular representative is committing a war crime.  War crimes have obviously been committed.  Providing language tutors certainly does not compensate for crimes committed.  Denying Ukrainian children access to education would be adding to the many other crimes Russia has already committed. 

Framing it as ""they have to learn Russian"" might be a really slick move.  Nationalists war mongers (the ones committing genocide) do not have a good way to counter that.  

You can do a peace protest with a sign that says ""think of the children"".  In Moscow that gets you locked up.  This lady made the parliament actually think about Ukrainian children.",False,1649955465.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4oxiv9,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Native children were put into facilities separated from their family.  They were punished for speaking native language.  They were not allowed to practice native religion or rituals.

ESL classes are conducted in English but on recess the kids can speak whatever they want to.

Edit:  ""Deportation"" is not genocide if you return them as soon as the war ends.  During disasters evacuation is the right thing to do.  Clearly Russia is at fault for creating the disaster.  We will see if they make efforts to return children to family.  There has not been enough time for us to know what they are doing.

I follow the Moskva

Down to the ocean floor

Listening to the wind of change

&nbsp;

An April spring-day's night

Soldiers passing by

Listening to the wind of change

&nbsp;

The world is closing in

Did you ever think

That we could be so close, like brothers

&nbsp;

The future's in the air

I can feel it everywhere

Blowing with the wind of change

&nbsp;


Take it to the bottom of the ocean

On a glory night

Where the debris of the Moskva drifts away

In the wind of change

&nbsp;

Walking down the street

Distant memories

Are dredged up by these assholes' war

&nbsp;

I follow the Moskva 

Down to the ocean floor

Listening to the wind of change

Take it to the bottom of the ocean

On a glory night

So the children of tomorrow can dare to dream

With you and me

&nbsp;

Take it to the bottom of the ocean

On a glory night

So the children of tomorrow can dream away

In the wind of change

&nbsp;

The wind of change blows straight 

Into the face of time

Like a storm wind that will ring 

The freedom bell for peace of mind

Let our bayraktars sing

What my guitar wants to say

Yeah, but not because of catastrophic losses. Because of the whole Russian Civil War / Takeover of Lenin thing going on. Also, Trotsky was an idiot.

--------

If we're going by the old playbook, what's happening now is the Russo-Japanese War of the 1904-time period. Russia is getting their ass kicked by an underestimated opponent, but Russia also holds all the cards. (IE: Russia can stop this war whenever it wants to, its just stubborness that's preventing them from doing so. Japan in 1904 had no ability to attack Russia, and Ukraine in 2022 has no desire to attack Russia proper)

The collapse of the Russian-front in WW1 was due to the weakened state of the Tsar, the Russian Civil War, and finally because Germans began to march into Russian territory. There's no such aggression happening right now in Russia, so I find it highly unlikely that any such collapse would happen. Putin will eventually be forced to withdraw his troops, the world will laugh at Russia's sorry state, but... that's it. No actual long-term damage inside of Russia proper (not like what the Germans were inflicting in 1917 or 1918).",1649961473.0,1649961250.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4qdnko,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Have you watched stranger things or halt and catch fire?  It gives you something of a feel for it.  Latchkey kids were a real thing.  I was lucky enough that my mom was home in the afternoons, but kids back then had unprecedented amounts of time and freedom.  You were expected to keep your wits about you and sometimes you needed to.  When I was a kid I rode my bike to the rec center about a mile away and had a creepy guy following me around until I ditched him and got somewhere with other people.  School bullying was really different.  It was more violent (kids would literally get dragged off by their arms and legs behind the school and beat up), but I can't remember hearing about any school shootings and there was no social media.  It didn't follow you home.  If felt a lot simpler.  It was really special when we got a VCR and replaced our giant ancient microwave.  Our appliances were ~~lime~~ avocado green.  So was the matching communal telephone.

We did drills at school where we ducked under desks in case of nuclear attacks (hah!), but it felt sort of like a relic from previous eras and the kids didn't really take it seriously.  Everyone was mostly freaking out about drugs, sex, and HIV.  I never really remember being worried about nuclear attacks.  Then in 1989 the Berlin wall fell and in 1991 the USSR fell.  Nuclear war was long forgotten and the middle east became a much bigger topic with unprecedented footage of the (gulf) war on broadcast TV.

The 90s were like a renaissance.  Computers were a new frontier with limitless possibilities.  There was an amazing plethora of new music.  The economy was running like a freight train.

But that's not ""being in somebodies pocket.""

As the foreign minister he shared and shaped the relationship Germany wanted to have with Russia, which was in general supported by the German population. Of course he will meet other heads of state or representatives.

You wouldn't claim that Steinmeier is in the pockets of the USA because he had meeting with Obama, would you?

Here's a completely different thought: His work was the reason why Ukraine is able to defend itself today.

Sounds outrageous right? But, if Russia had attacked earlier, the Ukrainian army might not have had the time to rebuild itself after Russia attacked first. That he tried to get a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine (and was thanked for by Zelenskyy btw.) gave Ukraine the time needed as it removed one of the justifications of Russia to continue a war. Meanwhile the weak sanctions (but highly targeted) prevented Russia from producing modern weapons, preventing their side from preparing.

But in 2014, this invasion would have succeed.

In that way, Appeasement as a policy might not prevent wars, but it might delay them enough for you to prepare yourself.

The problem is, we won't know either way as we don't have a parallel world available to us where we see the alternatives play out.",1649938958.0,1649938487.0,t3_u38mps,t1_i4ou7ku,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

And Netherlands, Belgium, some of the nordic countries, the balkans, Chekoslovakia, all the countries that were in the soviet union.

Also interesting that Nazi Germany pretty much did the same manouver when they attacked Poland as Russia tried and failed to do against Ukraine.

>They couldn't take on Britain, they lost the battle of Britain.

Nope, huge strategic blunder. But at the same time Britain wouldn't be able to beat germany either.

>They were decimated against Russia, with the worst losses being the eastern front to the point their line collapsed all the way to Berlin.

Yeah, but imagine Soviets without lend lease, and even then their K/D ratio of the soviets were appaling.

>In what world is this ""beating every military?"" They only won against 2 tiny nations and Poland then lost to everyone else.

Again, it was more than 2 countries so I don't know where you are getting that number from.


>They fought the entire world since 1942, not 1939, and were defeated in 1945. 2.5 years of mobilization and losing more and more land.

They were at war with everyone since 1941, and also had to use troops in occupied territories.



But obviously you claim that because of their total strategic failures that their army wasn't effective. Its like saying if Finland lost to Soviet Union + USA + UK that their army wasn't effective because their politicians got them into an unwinnable war.

Wow, posting an incredibly misleading opinion piece and pretending it proves your argument.  Nice.

It's pretty clear you're acting in bad faith by trying to use this statistic.  Before the war, Iraq was under sanctions which prevented anyone from doing business with them.  Hence, no foreign  companies.  If the US wanted access to Iraq's oil, it would have pushed to lift sanctions.  Invasion was not necessary to get access to Iraq's oil, just lifting sanctions.

Second, contracts to foreign companies to develop oil fields IS NOT GIVING THE US IRAQ's OIL.  

Third, [Most contracts have gone to non-US companies](http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1948787,00.html).  Notice your BS opinion article says that Iraq's oil industry is now ""utterly dominated by foreign firms"" - NOT us firms.  The fact that foreign firms are developing Iraqs oil is just common sense, and is not a sign of some conspiracy to steal Iraq's oil.  

Fourth, the Iraqi government is not a US-puppet.  It booted the US military out of Iraq.

>The US invasion Led to a milloin iraqis killed most not In the army.

No, it didn't.  I just pointed out this is bullshit yet you just immediately repeat this debunked talking point.
