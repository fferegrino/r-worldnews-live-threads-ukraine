**Russians have destroyed a Chernobyl lab**


Russian troops occupying the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have ""looted and destroyed"" a laboratory at the site, Ukrainian officials claim.

The State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management said the Russians had damaged their Central Analytical Labratory, which processed a lot of radioactive waste.

The state agency said in a Facebook post that the laboratory had **”highly active samples and samples of radionuclides, which today are in the hands of the enemy"".**

The lab, which cost about **six million euros to set up,** had also contained **”valuable analytical equipment"" that were not available elsewhere in Europe,** the agency said.

Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, is not a working power station but still requires constant management.

The Russians captured it in the first few days of the war last month, and had kept workers there for weeks before some were released.

The former nuclear site remains a great concern, and earlier this week Ukraine's parliament reported that forest fires had erupted in the vicinity of the plant, which were picked up in satellite images.",False,1648009508.0,t3_tklhyv,t3_tklhyv,,0,129,0,129,0,0,

""Russian oligarchs are suffering from sanctions and want to stop Putin
March 23, 2022

Russian oligarch Peter Aven and Kazakh billionaire Alexander Mashkevich met in Moscow. During the meeting, Aven noted that Russian oligarchs are extremely irritated by Putin's policies. Sanctions imposed on Russia and specific businessmen over the war in Ukraine have hit the fortunes of Russian billionaires hard.

It was also said that representatives of Russian big business are currently looking for ways to influence the dictator or his inner circle from the power bloc. But this is complicated by the fact that Putin is in strict isolation and does not allow anyone to himself. First of all, the oligarchs, whom he considers ""unreliable."" However, big Russian business is ready for the most radical steps. Some oligarchs are even discussing paying for Putin's physical removal.

Peter Aven: Russian politician and businessman. President of Alfa-Bank Joint-Stock Commercial Bank. According to Forbes, in 2021 he ranked 30th in the list of 200 richest businessmen in Russia, with a personal fortune of $ 5.3 billion.

Alexander Mashkevich: Kazakh billionaire, a native of Kyrgyzstan, a Canadian citizen, lives in Tel Aviv. According to Forbes, in 2016 his fortune was $ 1.5 billion.""

Many argued that Europe can't stop buying Russian oil and gas and thus will continue funding Russian war machine. Well, it seems problem solved itself. Today Putin declared he'll sell Russian gas to unfriendly countries only for rubles

That makes position of those advocating for continuing this import much weaker. Just yesterday if you wanted to continue buying Russian gas you could simply keep status quo, which is easy procedure-wise. But now you'll have to abandon it and make active effort to keep import

Just yesterday those advocating for keeping the gas import from Russia had a high ground in a short term perspective. They could sabotage the efforts of those wanting to stop it while Russia keeps fighting. But now it's the opposite

Now opponents of gas import from Russia absolutely can sabotage the efforts of those who strive to continue it. You simply need to sabotage their every attempt to switch to rubles to pay for Russian gas until Russia loses. Under the EU vetocracy that's certainly a high ground

There is however a problem here. Russian gas continues flowing via Ukraine and Ukraine gets transit fees that help fund its war efforts. Absurd as it may sound, that's reality. Thus new sources of funding must be secured to compensate this loss, so that Ukraine can keep resisting

Russia Today chief Simonyan commented:  
""Next step - barter payments with airplanes, high speed trains, whatever we need""   
Sounds dumb. But it reflects the weak point of Russian economy: machinery. Russia desperately needs imported machinery and will soon be crumbling without it

Stoltenberg accused China of providing political support and of “spreading blatant lies and disinformation” and said Beijing’s role in the invasion would be addressed at the summit.

He said that China has questioned the right of independent nations to choose their own path, adding that the alliance is concerned that China could provide “material support for the Russian invasion.”

Don't get me wrong we do still have gas because that heat pump system only works to around -5 Deg C before its efficiency drops off and gas has to kick on.  Is it because its just easier to buy a gas heating unit as AC isn't really needed in most of northern Europe?

They’ve been posting screenshots with translations from Chinese internet, sharing news stories and comments. The account is illuminating, especially as an expat living in China. 

I made the mistake of responding to their tweets, first with a mechanical translation- but then to someone who claimed they were cherry-picking comments to make China look bad. My response was more or less ‘I’m in favor of what they’re doing, as it shows the good and bad’.

Didn’t realize that person was actually a Chinese troll, and that I’d forgotten a link to my work portfolio on Twitter. The troll responded with ‘u work at (Chinese name of my school)?’

I don’t expect anything will happen, but I blocked Twitter and deleted the post. The whole thing really freaked me out- it feels like a pretty clear threat. 

Anyway, that account is out doing troll things- posting copied images listing US ‘interventions’ that pretend Yugoslavia or Libya were unilateral actions, or constantly ‘whatabouting’ for everything. Syria in particular irks me, due to the overwhelming amount of war crimes committed by Russia and the Syrian gov being portrayed as US bombing.

Putin insists Russian gas is paid for in roubles

Russian President Vladimir Putin says Moscow will begin insisting that payments for Russian gas from ""unfriendly countries"" are made in roubles.  
  
He's given the Russian central bank a week to find a way of switching these payments away from other currencies.  
  
He says the change will only affect payments and that gas will continue to be supplied in line with existing contracts. It's not clear what the impact of this decision will be.

Nestle pulls KitKat out of Russia

Swiss food giant Nestle is pulling its popular brands, like KitKat and Nesquik, out of Russia.  
  
The firm stopped investment in the country earlier this month and now it will only sell essential foods - infant food and medical and hospital nutrition.  
  
It follows fierce criticism of the firm by Ukrainian politicians. On Saturday, President Zelenskiy criticised Nestle for still conducting business in Russia in a streamed speech to protesters.  
  
A growing number of international brands, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have halted business in Russia, due to the invasion of Ukraine.  
  
A minority of others continue to produce non-essential goods in the country, while companies such as M&S and Burger King say complex franchise agreements make it impossible to close their shops in Russia.

>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could lead to famine in Africa and the Middle East if Europe does not urgently increase funding to the U.N. World Food Program, its executive director, David Beasley, has warned.

>Beasley told Politico that the World Food Program (WFP) is “billions short” on funding due to inflation caused by the pandemic, as well as the impact of climate change and conflict. He warned European leaders, who are meeting to discuss the global food crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine, that “failure to provide a few extra billion dollars” this year would mean “famine, destabilization and mass migration” for the world.

>“If you think we’ve got hell on Earth now, you just get ready,” Beasley said, adding that the situation is likely to worsen later this year, spurring migration. “If we neglect northern Africa, northern Africa’s coming to Europe. If we neglect the Middle East, [the] Middle East is coming to Europe.”

For those who are nervous about whatever Russia just announced, here is a timeline of things that were going to immediately defeat Ukraine: 

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. 

Day twenty-two: three guys from the Tennessee national guard were found in Ukraine, dead or maybe actually alive and still fighting, we're not sure. Is NATO going to be pulled in and start WWIII because of foreign volunteers? Better stop allowing them! 

Day twenty-three: Russia is sending their generals to the frontlines. Putin just spoke to a loud group. Russia is revitalized and starting *right now* will take the war seriously. 

Day twenty-four: Russia says it used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for first time. Russia actively mobilizes male population 

Day twenty-five: Russia sanctions President Biden's father and Hillary Clinton, shows Tucker and Cawthorn on state TV, and talks about biolabs. Marjorie Trailer Greene rants unintelligibly. Q has been activated. The American right suddenly remembers Russia is the victim. The dumbest person you know wants you to do your own research but not via academic studies, journalism, or history. 

Day twenty-six: Russia sends a mean letter threatening Poland if they follow through on sanctions. 

Day twenty-seven: They didn't get the response they wanted last time, so Russia clears its throat and announces a little bit more loudly that they're launching hypersonic missiles in the west. 

Day twenty-eight: “Smoke can be seen coming from the Russian Embassy in the Polish Capital City of Warsaw, there are claims that Russian Diplomats are burning documents, the same thing was done at the Russian Embassy in the Ukrainian Capital City of Kyiv right before the Invasion of February 24th.”

> Ladies and gentlemen senators!
> 
> Ladies and gentlemen deputies!
> 
> Chosen of Paris!
> 
> French people!
> 
> Thank you for the honor of speaking to you today.
> 
> I am sure that you are well aware of what is happening in Ukraine. You know why this happens. And you know who is to blame. Even those who bury their heads in the sand know. And his hands are still trying to find money from Russia.
> 
> So today I turn to you. To the honest, to the brave, to the rational and freedom-loving. I ask questions: how to stop the war? how to return peace to our state? Because most of the puzzles that make up the answer are in your hands.
> 
> On March 9, Russian bombs were dropped on a children's hospital and a maternity hospital in our city of Mariupol. It was a peaceful city in the south of Ukraine. Absolutely peaceful - until Russian troops approached him and laid siege to him, as in the Middle Ages. Until they began to starve people, thirst, kill with fire.
> 
> There were people in the maternity hospital where the Russians dropped bombs on him. There were women who were preparing to give birth. Most of them were saved. Some were seriously injured. One woman had to have her foot amputated, which was completely shattered. 
> 
> And another woman ... She had a broken pelvis. Her child died before birth. They tried to save the woman. Fought for her life! But she begged the doctors for her death. She begged to leave her, not to help her. Because she didn't know what to live for. They fought. She died. In Ukraine. In Europe. In 2022. When hundreds of millions of people did not even think that it could be so, that the world could be so ruined.
> 
> I ask you now to observe a moment of silence in memory of thousands of Ukrainian men and women, all those who were killed as a result of Russia's invasion of the territory of our peaceful Ukraine.
> 
> After weeks of Russian invasion, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities hit by the occupiers resemble the ruins of Verdun. As in the photos of the First World War, which, I'm sure, each and every one of you saw. The Russian military does not distinguish between which targets to hit. They destroy everything: residential neighborhoods, hospitals, schools, universities. Warehouses with food and medicine are being burned. They burn everything. 
> 
> They do not take into account concepts such as ""war crimes"" and ""binding conventions"". They brought terror to Ukraine, state terror. Each and every one of you is aware of this. All information is available. All the facts are there.
> 
> About women who are raped by the Russian military in the temporarily occupied areas. About refugees they just shoot on the roads. About the journalists they kill, knowing for sure that they are journalists. About old people who survived the Holocaust and are now forced to flee bomb shelters from Russian attacks on peaceful cities.
> 
> For 80 years, Europe has not seen what is happening in Ukraine. Because of Russia's actions. When there are people so desperate that they beg for death! Like this woman.
> 
> In 2019, when I became President, there was already a format for negotiations with Russia. It was the Normandy format. The format of the negotiations that were to end the war in Donbass. Unfortunately, the war in eastern Ukraine, which has been going on for 8 years.
> 
> Four countries took part in the Normandy format - Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France. Four, but through them the whole world, all positions, the whole world was represented. Someone supported. Someone was trying to delay the process. Someone wanted to ruin everything. But it seemed important that the world was always present at that Normandy table, the table of peace.
> 
> And when the negotiations paid off, when we managed to free people from captivity, when we were able to agree on some decisions in December 2019, it was like a breath of fresh air. Like a glimmer of hope. Hopes that talks with Russia can help. That the Russian leadership can be convinced in words. That Moscow chooses peace.
> 
> But it came on February 24. A day that canceled all those efforts. All of us. He crossed out the old meaning of the word ""dialogue"". He crossed out the European experience of relations with Russia. He crossed decades of European history. 
> 
> All this was bombed by Russian troops. Defeated by Russian artillery. Burned after Russian missile strikes.
> 
> The truth was not found in the offices. So now we have to look for her and fight on the battlefield.
> 
> So what now? What do we have left? Our values. Unity. And the determination to defend our freedom. Shared freedom! One for Paris and Kyiv. For Berlin and Warsaw. For Madrid and Rome. For Brussels and Bratislava.
> 
> Sips of fresh air will definitely not help. It makes sense to act together. To press together. To encourage Russia to seek peace.
> 
> Ladies and Gentlemen!
> 
> French people!
> 
> On February 24, the Ukrainian people united. Today we have no right or left. We do not look at who is in power and who is in opposition. The usual policy ended on the day of Russia's invasion and will resume only when there is peace. 
> 
> And rightly so - to fight for life. To protect our state.
> 
> We are grateful to you, we are grateful that France is helping. We are grateful for the efforts of President Macron. Who showed real leadership. We are constantly communicating with him, it is true, we are coordinating some of our steps.
> 
> Ukrainians see that France values ​​freedom as much as it has always been. And you protect her. You remember what it is. Freedom, equality, brotherhood. Each of these words is full of power for you! I feel it. Ukrainians feel it.
> 
> That is why we expect from you, we expect from France, from your leadership, that you will be able to make Russia seek peace. To end this war against freedom. Against equality. Against brotherhood. Against everything that made Europe united. And full of free diverse life.
> 
> We expect from France, from your leadership, that Ukraine's territorial integrity will be restored. And together we can do it.
> 
> If there are those who are in doubt, your people are already sure. Like other peoples of Europe.
> 
> And that during France's presidency in the European Union a long-ripened historical decision will be made - on Ukraine's full membership in Europe and the EU. A historic decision in historical time. As has always been the case in the history of the French people.
> 
> Ladies and Gentlemen!
> 
> French people!
> 
> Tomorrow will be a month when Ukrainians are fighting for their own lives, for their own freedom. How heroically our army opposes the overwhelming forces of Russia.
> 
> We need more help! We need more support!
> 
> In order for freedom not to lose, it must be well-armed. Tanks and anti-tank weapons, aviation and air defense. We need all this! You can help us. I know. You can!
> 
> In order for freedom not to lose, the world must support it with sanctions against the aggressor. Every week - a new sanctions package. Each!
> 
> French companies must leave the Russian market. Renault, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and others. They must cease to be sponsors for Russia's military machine, sponsors of the killing of children and women, sponsors of rape, robbery, and looting by the Russian army.
> 
> All companies must remember once and for all that values ​​are worth more than profits. Also profit on blood. And you and I must already be thinking about the future. About how we will live after this war.
> 
> Guarantees are needed. Strong guarantees. Guarantees that security will be unshakable, that there will be no war, and that war in general will be impossible.
> 
> We create such a system of guarantees. New security system. In which France, I believe, will play a leading role. So that no one will ever have to beg for death again! That people live their lives. Full life. And to say goodbye to people not under bombs, not in war, but when your time comes.
> 
> Only in peace. Only in dignity. Because you have to live so that you are respected. To be remembered. And to say goodbye to you as the whole world saw, as France said goodbye to the great Belmondo.
> 
> **Thank you, France!**
> 
> **Glory to Ukraine!**

I do agree that my condemnation is not fair and was too wide. So I stand corrected, fuck all Russians who are not protesting. 

I would like to tell you why I condemn them. 

I was a student in a socialistic Czechoslovak republic. Kid during the USSR times and I lived in an oppressive society not different from that of Russia today. We had to study Marxism, I had to learn Russian. We were not allowed to have opinions, to read books from the west or listen to a western music. We were not allowed to travel. Most of us never were to the west, we didn't know about all freedoms people there had. We had no internet. Just a radio we listened to in secret. 

And then it happened... 

On 17.11.1989 several students started to protests against gouvernement in capitol. At the Hight of the protests there were just 10.000 protesters. Government decided to stop the protest and police used violence. They used water canons, they unleashed police dogs on us. They used armored trucks.  Some estimates say that over 500 people were wounded. 

A rumor started to spread that one of the students was killed. 

On several next days protests were every day. People were extremely angry on government for hurting the students. Our parents went to streets even tho some of them were ok with government but they cared for their children. Protests growing with each day and suppressed by the police.

On 23.11.1989 several workers went to strike. Chairman of the Central Committee addressed the workers. ""The party's central committee believes it can rely on the workers, ""he said from the balcony to hundreds of assembled workers. He continued with ""In no country, neither developing nor socialist nor capitalist, is it possible on children's whim to determine when the president should leave or when he should come and who should be the president!"" A disapproving whistle followed, and after a few seconds workers started chanting: ""**We are not children! We are not children**!""

This was a breaking point. That day over 300.000 people went to the streets protesting for constitutional change and singing national anthem. 

Next day almost entire nation went on strike. By the 28th 800.000 people went to the streets of capitol alone (nation had 10.3 milion people). 

By the end, leader of the communist party and the president both resigned. And I had a privilege to see that and be there. 

In my eyes, me and every one in my country earned our freedom. We took it. If my kid went to protest today and got beaten, I'd go there and take his place, no matter my political opinion. 

Whenever I hear a Russian say, I do not care about politics. In my eyes, he is no different from those who actively support the regime.

*""There may be a way to further expand the scope of sanctions,"" he told reporters. In addition, Izumi, the representative of the Constitutional Democratic Party, said, ""We should do our best to stop the barbarism and aggression from Russia.""*

&#x200B;

*On the other hand, Muneo Suzuki, a member of the House of Councilors of the Nippon Ishin no Kai, who has a thick pipe with Russia* (I believe this means connections with Russia)*, requested that the Japanese government send a strong message to the international community, ""Stop shooting, talk.""*

&#x200B;

The Nippon Ishin no Kai party made some controversy statements prior to Zelensky's address such as Tōru Hashimoto, ex Osaka govonor suggesting to an Ukraninan analyst on TV that Ukraine should surrender rather than fight the Russians, similar to what Japan did by surrendering to prevent fighting on inland Japan. This caused considerable heated debate.

The first deliveries of the $800 million in new military aid that US President Joe Biden is sending to Ukraine have started to arrive in country, an administration official tells CNN.

Biden announced the new package last week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered an impassioned plea to Congress for more help. 

The US will continue to move the rest of the $800 million into Ukraine as quickly as possible, the official said, given it includes 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems and 100 armed drones, among other assistance. Both are seen as critical to Ukraine's defense.

Economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Europe and their allies have shaken the Russian economy and caused the value of the ruble to plunge.

On Wednesday President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came up with a way to get his opponents to help prop up his currency, by demanding that “unfriendly countries” use rubles to buy the Russian oil and gas that is still flowing.

“I have made a decision to implement in the shortest possible time a set of measures to switch payments for … our natural gas supplied to the so-called unfriendly countries to Russian rubles,” Mr. Putin said on Wednesday.

This should be fun because NATO and EU were predicted to add sanctions after meeting that included holding all payments for Russian Petro products in an escrow type account until after Russia leaves Ukraine.

If you multiply that by 4 to get the approximate length of time that the United States fought in World War 2 (a war that saw millions of Americans fighting in multiple theaters against several countries with far larger armies than Ukraine), then Russia would lose 734,000 soldiers fighting Ukraine in the same time that the United States lost 291,557 soldiers fighting the Axis powers.

f3f30a1da6abef7786e556ea7cea53ab,tklhyv,i1tke8v,"I recently wrote a comment here about republicans agreeing with Putin because Russia is a Christian ethnostate who take in few refugees, dislikes LGBT rights, and embraces traditional gender roles. Not because of money or extortion. I also wrote that it didn’t start 2016 or with Trump. Not everyone were convinced. When the sub thread had over 8,5K comments, mine was in top 50 when sorting for controversial (link below). Therefore, here’s Putinology 101, part 2.

Some more examples.

David Duke. Former leader of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). It’s been reported that he repeatedly insisted that KKK was ”pro-white"" and ""pro-Christian”. In 1970, after having enrolled at LSU, he formed a white student group called the White Youth Alliance that was affiliated with the National Socialist White People's Party (a nazi party). *1 In 1979, Duke formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). *2 In 1989, Duke was voted in by a majority to serve as a republican in the Louisiana House. In 1990, Duke ran as a republican and got over 40% of the votes in a Senate election. As recent as 2016, Duke ran as a republican and got almost 60K votes in another Senate election. *1

It’s been reported that Duke had an organization called European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO). In 2004, EURO organized an international meeting in New Orleans, where Duke is said to have asked people to sign a ""New Orleans Protocol”, a set of principles ""pledging adherents to a pan-European outlook”. *3 The protocol is said to ”recognize national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples”. *1 It’s been reported that Duke, in the same year, called Russia “key to white survival”. *4 In 2006, it was reported that Duke had ”spent much time in recent years in Russia and Ukraine” and that his book, Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening on the Jewish Question, had ”become popular in anti- Semitic circles there”. *5

Rod Dreher. Senior editor and blogger at The American Conservative. *6 In 2013, he wrote an article called ”Putin The Paleo?”. *7 Paleoconservatism is described as ”a political philosophy and variety of conservatism in the United States stressing American nationalism, Christian ethics, regionalism, and traditionalist conservatism”. *8 In the article, Dreher discusses Pat Buchanan saying that Putin was having a “paleoconservative moment” and ”may be seeing the future with more clarity than Americans still caught up in a Cold War paradigm” (Pat Buchanan is a former assistant and special consul to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan). Dreher writes that Putin is ”onto something”. *7

Sure, corruption and bribes exist. It’s, however, reasonable to think that there’s a large number of republicans out there who agree with Putin because of ideological reasons, and that that number vastly exceeds the number who are doing it because of money or extortion.

Wednesday, March 23, 2022 03:14 PM 
By Bloomberg News

Russia says ready to keep supply, doesn’t want euros, dollars
European gas prices surged more than 30% after the news
(Bloomberg) --Russia plans to demand ruble payments for natural gas purchases from “unfriendly” nations, deepening its standoff with the west and potentially aggravating Europe’s worse energy crunch since the 1970s.
President Vladimir Putin ordered the central bank to develop a mechanism to make ruble payments for natural gas within a week at a meeting with his government. While Russia named the U.S., the U.K. and members of the European Union as unfriendly nations, it said it will continue to supply gas in line with requests.

The order may mean some terms of Russia’s contracts with European customers, which are mostly in euros -- will need to be renegotiated. Any supply disruptions as a result of changing rules would worsen Europe’s energy crisis, with the news sending benchmark gas prices rallying more than 30%.

“I have taken a decision to switch to ruble payments for our natural gas supplies to the so-called hostile states,” Putin said on Wednesday.

Russia needs to stop using “the compromised currencies” in natural-gas transactions in retaliation to the U.S. and European sanctions, he said, according to a transcript published on the Kremlin website. “It’s pretty clear that it makes no sense for us to supply our goods to the European Union, to the U.S. and receive payments in dollars, euros, other currencies,” he said.

The comments from the Kremlin come as Russia has faced unprecedented sanctions from the western countries and its allies, which shut-off its economy from the rest of the world, restricting the nation’s ability to export and import goods, and even access much of its foreign reserves. 

Benchmark European gas prices rose to 113.74 euros a megawatt-hour, the highest in two weeks. The ruble strengthened over 8% versus the dollar, but soon narrowed the advance. The Russian currency traded 4.3% firmer at 99.25 per U.S. Dollar as of 5:30 p.m. In Moscow, its strongest level in three weeks.",False,1648050878.0,t3_tklhyv,t3_tklhyv,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

> For this reason and the harm that sanctions impose (on those who are sanctioned) Biden should tell the world that the U.S. will lift its sanctions against ordinary Russians when Russia and Ukraine strike a deal to end the war. Why hasn’t he done that? In part, I suspect for the same reasons Americans found it so hard to question the wisdom of invading Afghanistan in 2001. Because given the current outrage, it’s hard for Biden to do anything that makes him look soft on Putin 

> Imposing sanctions is less bad than going to war or doing nothing at all. But the way many Americans talk about sanctions exaggerates their effectiveness and ignores their cost. And over the last few decades this has contributed to a sanctions addiction that has harmed both the U.S. and the world. So it’s crucial that that Biden explain when sanctions end. And it’s crucial that Americans support that decision even if doing so gets them labeled soft-on-Putin. The lesson of Afghanistan is that outrage is not a strategy. It’s one Americans need to remember now. 

I know we’re all outraged at Putin for starting this unnecessary war, but let’s not repeat the mistakes of the early 2000s and the war on terror. We can not let our anger blind us to reality. It’s a recipe for disaster.

NATO countries have territories that are disputed, Cyprus, Kurdistan, East/West Germany, Irish Isle, Gibraltar, Spain/Morroco.

However they don’t step in with areas not in the North Atlantic like the Falkland Islands.   So does that mean Pacific territories are also not covered like Guam, Hawaii, French Polynesia.

The switchblades are a drone with ~15 minutes of flight time, with *reasonable* AI and targetting. This means, if you fly it up and mark a target, it will keep track of the target (even if it moves)  and you don't have to do anything more. If your connection interrupts or if you have to pack up and leave, the drone will simply do the attack. Only further involvement is to cancel the attack (and per user accounts: the usability is such that a child could control it. Minimal training is required)

For the actual weapon: they are equipped with an equivalent of a 40mm grenade. Those are the ones that are fired from conventional grenade launchers.  
The trick though is: as far as I can tell, the switchblades have a directional explosion radius. (Please correct me if I am wrong on this, I wanna learn) Instead of exploding in a 360°, the explosion goes out in a cone.   
Directional explosions are *much, much, MUCH* more destructive.  Instead of the energy being wasted in empty spaces, all of the energy goes in one direction, basically obliterating everything in the way.  
Explosives of similar sizes might have trouble punching through armored plates, directional explosive will punch a hole in the plate and a concrete barrier behind it. 

Oh and they are so small that conventional radars will not pick them up reliably and by the time you hear them it's too late. 

Isn't drone warfare fun?

> 
> BNP, which had already said it would halt new financing deals, said on Tuesday it would stop processing other types of transactions. French peer Crédit Agricole, which similarly only has investment banking activities in Russia, later said it would also halt all commercial activity there.
> 
> The lenders said they were now informing Russian clients.
> 
> Their decision highlights the contrasting approaches of banks to the crisis, with some grappling with how to continue to run their local Russian operations and others leaving.

> 
> BNP, the eurozone’s biggest bank, declined to comment on what would happen to its roughly 500 staff in Russia. Crédit Agricole has 170 staff in the country.

Because in Finland, the cities tend to have centralized heating, and that is heated by the power plants. then distributed across the state.

They could’ve easily bombed it the way US bombed Baghdad in Iraq (they very much have the capabilities for that), but I’m not sure how they’d explain that to Russian populace. Even if they wanted to occupy, destroyed Kiev isn’t going to bring Ukrainians to their side.

2) The convoy and Russians around Kiev are probably just a ruse for now. Again, going with the demilitarization goal, Russians have been encircling Ukrainian forces in the east of the country. Were it not for Russians in front of Kiev threatening an attack, more Ukrainian soldiers could’ve been sent east.

We want people to have the rights that we enjoy, but some of us don’t want them to do the hard work of getting those things. 

The fact remains that in order for people to govern themselves and control their own lives, they have to take that responsibility for themselves, and in the case of living under oppressive regimes, that means taking it.

Ukraine is doing exactly that, and they are doing it while being blown up, shot, burned, and watching their homes be leveled to the ground.

And as disgusting it is to say, I suspect quite few countries would rather sacrifice Ukraine - either partly, the currently Russian-held areas, or completely - than continue keeping up the sanctions and actually support Ukraine. This isn’t something I can prove, this is just the feeling I get when I follow news that come from some countries, such as Germany (after proclaiming the biggest foreign policy changes in 70 years, has now become much more like “regular” Germany again that is much more awkward and seemingly less compassionate), France (whose companies continue doing business in Russia and I think Macron even endorsed a carmaker to continue operating their plant in Russia), Hungary. 

This same sentiment, btw, was also echoed in one Estonian article published a few days ago, where it was alluded that the Ukraine’s foreign minister supposedly had said to an Estonian governmental official that they’ve been getting some push towards “achieving a peace and saving civilian lives” from big players, because they don’t want to continue see suffering and that even in a current position, a peace is better then killed civilians. 

I suspect that this is a fundamental difference between big European countries, whose last big war was WWII and whose threat-level has been very small (and who have not seen Russia as a threat at all) and between those countries, who have been threatened by Russia for a long time and for whom injustices done by WWII ended sometime in early 1990s or late 1980s - the big countries see loss of life and want peace no matter what, whereas smaller countries with experience of Russian terror and control see Ukraine trying to fight no matter the cost, because the cost is literally the loss of statehood and independence, because this is exactly what Russia has been doing to us or trying to do ever since WWII ended.",False,1648036233.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1s011u,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

""Consider a timely paper on Russian army by Bismarck Analysis. It's good & informative. It's correct on its land-based and artillery-centric character. It's also correct that Minister of Defence Serdyukov greatly increased army's efficiency in 2007-2012. But it's still misleading

Yes, Minister Serdyukov indeed reformed the army. He increased its efficiency, fought with corrupt and crony armament producers improving the army supplies. As a result he became extremely unpopular, made tons of powerful enemies and was ousted in 2012 losing his power and status

His successor Shoygu knew better than that. Now who's Shoygu? Shoygu is the \*only\* single Russian minister who uninterruptedly worked in government since 1991, since the very beginning of Russian Federation. He worked for all presidents, all prime ministers avoided all purges

What does it mean? It means he's a cunning political entrepreneur, great in court politics, publicity, image. You survive every single administration by maxing your political survival. And to max it you need to minimise animosity. So you never object to powerful interest groups

Serdyukov fought with interest groups and was destroyed. Shoygu was smarter than that. He launched a PR campaign presenting himself as the ""saviour"" from the Serdyukov's legacy. Whatever his predecessor did, was  dismantled. Media cheered, people cheered, interest groups cheered

That's a very, very typical problem. Efficiency-maxing requires ruthlessness in dealing with established elites and interest groups. Meanwhile court-politics-maxing requires pondering to them and not making enemies. Serdyukov was maxing efficiency, Shoygu - court politics

There was another issue. Shoygu is ethnic Tuvan. In such a country as Russia minority member can hardly become the supreme leader. People don't perceive him as ethnic Russian (see his palace) which means he's not dangerous for the leader and you can safely delegate him the army""

This is good for collective global security against nuclear war... bad for countries that don't see the point of a large nuclear arsenal unless it can be used for blackmail to bully countries outside of collective defense treaties. Thus the rush to steal parts of Ukraine before joining EU or NATO.

This included things like cutting public salaries and subsidies and the sale of state-owned enterprises to the private sector to raise money. Organized crime groups and wealthy well-connected individuals were thus able to strike bargains with exhausted public officials getting paid very little - bribes in exchange for rigging the bidding and sale of state owned enterprises.

A small bribe meant someone could buy a copper mine or steel mill or railroad yard or auto plant for pennies on the dollar. The people who owned now owned these assets used them as their personal piggy banks - skimming from the profits, paying themselves lavish salaries, or taking out large loans using them as collateral to buy even more. 

Eventually foreign investment money and trade liberalization allowed this group to accumulate even more capital, and soon you get a cohort of extremely wealthy individuals.

When Putin came to power, part of his appeal was taking on the Oligarchs, and he did.

Let's say you have a fictitious currency, call it ""rubbles"".  Which is worth dirt.  If you produce oil, you can claim that your oil is only exchangeable for e.g. 1000 rubbles per barrel of oil.   Because oil is now convertible to and from rubbles, and it is a stable and relatively fungible commodity (in which there is a futures market), you have just pegged rubbles to the price of oil.   Assuming someone will buy your oil.

But this is also bad.  Firstly, you lose control of the value of your currency.  You can't manipulate supply and demand of rubbles as you can via central bank mechanisms (buying and selling in large amounts) you can only manipulate supply and demand of oil... which is much harder to do.

secondary problem is that Russian people have been basically brainwashed to think that Russia is a great power that others, including their neighbours, have to be afraid of and that the west is out there to get Russia and humiliate Russia. It is very hard to undo this kind of mental training, especially as those who are from the Soviet times have endured decades of it. The people themselves may not agree to a democratic switch (because of 90s) and may revolt and put another strong-armed leader in place. 

Third aspect is that democracy-building takes time and based on my own observations, even 30 years after the fall of the iron curtain, former socialist and soviet countries are still building that democracy and still trying to convince some parts of their population that democracy is the way to go. Mainly because people expected democracy to come quickly and shower us with its holy glow and everything would be magically okay, whereas in reality, you have to keep working on it, keep explaining it (especially to people who have not experienced economic successes and for whom globalisation has been negative, and who look back at USSR times and think that this was okay too) etc. I presume it’s the same in Russia - if you promise them democracy, they also need to be explained that democracy takes time and that changes may be slow, very slow even. Basically what I’m trying to say is that it would be naive to think that Russia will switch over to democracy overnight but that it would be a slow slog, all the while you’d have to keep fighting against those people, who want the power themselves or those, who tend to claim that if they don’t see changes immediately then democracy has failed.",False,1648033612.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1rvxlc,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

1) According to a Finnish intelligence professor (an excellent 1 hour YouTube vid someone shared before)- most Russians have 2 types of conversations - externally, where they would parrot whatever Kremlin dictates, and internally, their kitchens, where actual opinions are discussed.  Any opinion polls or surveys or medias are the external type.  So, take a huge chunk of salt when any polls results are published. They don't portray actual truths.

2) We have a saying in our country that basically translate to an empty tin brings the loudest noise.  The emptier it is, the loudest it will be. Hence, whatever happening in Russia, i suspect we are only hearing the emptiest of them all.  

3) The Russians that are against this do exist, but my uneducated guess is they are currently working to get their voice heard, not to the world, but within their own communities.

“Gazprom would need to ask buyers to agree to change the payment terms in contracts,” said Trevor Sikorski, head of natural gas, coal and carbon at Energy Aspects Ltd. “It reopens the contracts, and buyers could ask for shorter-terms for instance.”

Some 58% of Gazprom’s gross gas sales abroad were in euros as of the third quarter of last year, according to the producer’s most recent bond prospectus. Another 39% were in U.S. dollars. The press office of gas giant Gazprom PJSC declined to comment on whether its long-term supply agreements allow a switch to ruble payments.

Russia announced earlier this month a list of 48 states deemed hostile. They included the U.S., Japan, all European Union members, Switzerland and Norway. As a result, the bulk of Russian gas exports now go to “unfriendly” nations.

“At the same time, I want to emphasize that Russia will definitely continue to supply natural gas in line with the volumes and prices and pricing mechanisms set forth in the existing contracts,” Putin said.

In the first 15 days of March, Gazprom exported an average of 500 million cubic meters per day to countries outside the former Soviet Union, including those in the EU, China and Turkey. Of the total, flows toward Europe averaged 384 million cubic meters per day, the producer’s data showed.",False,1648050978.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1t4uwp,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The US shock and awed them, invaded, occupied, left in tatters and Civil War. Like I said, there was more at play than WMDs, but that was the reason broadcasted to the world. 

The US also does what it wants. It's not just Russia.

That said, the Russian invasion feels like light vs dark. The way they are attacking civilians with indiscriminate heavy weapons is pure evil. I'm with you, its very hard to sit back and watch. It's not fair.

The question that most Americans have asked themselves is can they live with Ukraine falling and the answer is yes. The only red line is an attack on NATO. 

Even if Russia uses tactical nuke, the only public NATO concern is whether fallout lands on NATO countries. The NATO outrage is limited to acts that do not directly engage Russia or provide anything past the level of weapons given so far. 

It's not that NATO or the west is afraid of Russia. A NATO vs Russia war will not go well, for anyone, but especially Russia. That said, the consequences are massive and unpredictable for the entire world, especially those countries with alot to lose. 

So it's not fear of Russia, its a fear that the entire world as we know it will be irrevocably changed in the image of nuclear conflict. It's responsible in that aspect to stay out as much as possible.

- Germany has implemented sanctions in accordance with the sanctions packages of its allies and partially its own (Nordstream 2 cancelled)
- Germany has delivered weapons, first aid support and a fairly big chunk of financial support
- Germany is currently taking in a fairly large amount of refugees from Ukraine. It was over 200k a few days ago so probably around 250k now.
- Germany is pledging to move away from Russian oil and gas and is currently procuring alternatives, such as from Qatar.
- Germany is beefing up its military to contribute more to European security and NATO. 100 billion Euros are added as a special fund this year while for additional years a minimum of 2% of GDP must be spent. This was added to the constitution.

Foreign policy and energy dependance was (at least in parts, of course there are economic reasons) driven by the idea to include Russia into the European community to alleviate tensions and solve problems in an economic way. This failed unfortunately, but can't be reversed within a month. There are already agreements in place (see Qatar LNG deal a few days ago) to solve this.

In regards to the rearmament, I don't think a lot of non-Germans really understand how monumental this development is. After the disarmament after WWII and the educational and reconsciliatory (is this a word?) efforts, German population frowns upon any military involvement in foreign conflicts. Any political steps towards this direction were punished by German voters for years.

The German armed forces had very little budget to maintain their forces after 1991, so what you are seeing now in regards to weapon deliveries towards Ukraine might very well be a major part of our stock (what was it? 2000 Panzerfaust 3, 500 Stingers?).

&#x200B;

But right now? I agree, it looks rather weak and hesitant from the outside... but there's a lot in motion since the beginning of the war.

https://bpr.berkeley.edu/2019/12/16/gangs-and-gulags-how-vladimir-putin-utilizes-organized-crime-to-power-his-mafia-state/

Putin himself was a liaison between the USSR and criminals, situated through a major smuggling vein as well. This gives him a unique experience I dont think many other leaders have. Not many were negotiators to criminals. I can't even think of a situation where a major western power had talks with organized crime. Maybe Italy did this, but even then I am really reaching for someone that did this.

Its obvious Putin is in deep or else Cartels would not have requested weapons from him.

https://www.newsweek.com/mexican-drug-cartels-asked-russia-arms-dealers-help-shooting-down-us-1234167

This story was buried, even by Trump. This is no coincidence, because Trump is in with the Russians and stopping cartels would hurt Russia. This is why Trump lowered standards for the border patrol which in 2010 the FBI said was in danger of corruption and in one case, a border patrol agent was killed by crooked officers.

Whats more interesting is the TIMING of violence. Russia has been trying to buy the Mexican energy sector, which is historically kept locked down for national security reasons.

The election of AMLO is major because he too is implicated a Russian patsy. Mexico historically was very active in condemning conflict and being mediators, sometimes being the only one to do so, a tradition started by President Lazaro Cardenas and upheld to this day.

But under AMLO, this tradition was broken in the Ukraine conflict. He has also opened up energy sectors to Oligarchs at the same timeframe as heightened Cartel activity.

https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/russia-mexico-delegation-energy-sector.html

To make matters worse, Russian outlets were posting thinly veiled threats that only Russia could save Mexico from Cartels.

So its obvious Mexico is being compromised by Russia, but how much remains to be seen. CISEN is very secretive and one of the most secretive intelligence agencies on earth, not even the Mexican president could order them to say anything and they tried hard, so we wont get a definitive answer. If Russia penetrated Mexico, CISEN wouldn't say a word.

I’m putting neutral in speech marks, because in reality, all major foreign policy decisions had to be run by the Soviet Union before and the term finlandisation comes from that time period, which essentially means carrying out your state’s independence in extremely controlled environment, where you’re both de jure and de facto independent, but at the same time, your foreign policy decisions are severely influenced by another country’s positions and feelings on the matter. For 50 years, Finland lived like this and for many, until very recently that is, that was somewhat of a source of reasoning that Finland “understood” Russia because they had to learn how to handle them for 50 years. 

In reality, of course, whilst Finland kept their independence and learned to navigate the difficult relationship with Russia, later it made them blind to Russian actions and Russia’s true face. Finland has always prepared for another war with Russia - their whole military setup and doctrine is basically how to protect themselves from Russia, but when Estonia has been concerned about Russia in recent past, they basically told us that we were traumatised post-Soviets who should basically learn to live in the new world and learn from the Finns. Based on what’s been reported here, Russian attack on Ukraine has caused some pretty painful questions to be asked in Finland, because the idea that Finland understands Russia has been shattered (they didn’t believe Russia would attack, whereas according to an article published today, Estonia started preparing for a potential war already back in November). 

Because of Finland’s relationship with Russia, they also haven’t joined NATO. At first because they thought NATO no longer served a purpose post-CW, later because they didn’t want to escalate Russian tender feelings on the matter and they had been neutral for 50 years after all (with a kick-ass army). 

Now that Russia has actually attacked a LARGE country in Europe, Finland has some different thoughts. Normally it’s been the Finnish governments that have been more open about talking joining NATO and public as been opposed; now it’s vice versa - public is in favour, politicians are ambivalent. 

Also: Finland and Sweden both looked at what the other is doing. Sweden eventually said joining right now isn’t in their cards because it would destabilise things further. Finland hasn’t said it like that yet. Usually it’s been said that both countries move in tandem when it comes to NATO - if Finland joins, Sweden is expected to join too.

And lastly, you may have missed it but there is a war going on, and one side with a storied history of spreading lies and polluting discourse in other nations runs RT, and allowing it do so is simply allowing it to operate as a state-operated propaganda machine with the sole purpose of supporting its war efforts against the nation it invaded.

The thing, the mistake has already been made. Putin is just dealing with the consequences of it now. They were never supposed to become embroiled in an all out war. Every other problem Russia has stems from that.

So in that sense, he already has been ""stupid enough"". The only question that remains, is whether he can hold on to power. So far it appears that he can and that he will. But on the other hand, these kinds of things take time.

""We should be highly sceptical of claims that the pronouncements of economists about real world economic problems stand above any ideological influence. This might in turn allow for a more sober assessment of what economics can and can’t deliver.""

""Economics and ideology intertwine. This serves as a reminder that the use of economic propositions for diagnosis and policy prescription can be affected by a historically conditioned vision of how things are and “the way in which we wish to see them” (to borrow Schumpeter’s terminology).""

Many here in my country just do not believe that Germany would help us - EU and NATO or not. They believe that Germany would perhaps say something, but actual military help and sending forces or something - that would be like pulling teeth with pieces of strings. Same with France - many here were shocked when back in 2008, Sarkozy claimed that the agreement reached between him and Putin was somehow good for Georgia. The only body it was good for was of course Russia and seeing France serve it as a big peace victory was just seen here as a case either “they just don’t know and don’t understand” or “they don’t care as long as they don’t have to get involved and as long as they don’t suffer”. 

For example, the idea of an EU army has several issues, which is why people here AFAIK are not a fan of the idea. Who would lead it? Germany? We’d be defenceless then, many think, and would France ever agree to be lead by Germans? Would this EU army see Russia as a threat when things calm down and countries want to do business with Russia again?

Unlike the submarine-launched nuclear missiles both Russia and the United States maintain as a part of their nuclear triads, the Status-6 (sometimes called “Poseidon” or by its NATO designation of “Kanyon”) is actually a submersible drone. Once deployed by a Russian Navy submarine, the drone can travel autonomously toward its target, covering more than 5,400 miles at depths as low as 3,300 feet. Once it finds its target, the Status-6 simply parks and waits for the command 

Onboard this submersible drone is an absolutely massive warhead–with some claims saying it carries the same nuclear yield as the RS-28, and others claiming twice that. According to some Russian officials, the Status-6 can be equipped with a 100 megaton weapon… which is two times more powerful than the largest nuclear weapon ever even tested.

A detonation of that magnitude would not only destroy and irradiate a massive area, its positioning under water would result in a radioactive tsunami that would reach far further inland than the blast itself. In no uncertain terms, the Status-6 is intended to serve as a doomsday weapon.

 Reddit has this twisted and completely innacurate view of Russian and Soviet Red Army thinking there are gonna be millions of Ivans rushing forward, when Russia only has a pretty small percent of USSR's population and technology moved past the point where you can learn how to drive T34 in 2 days and fly IL-2 in 10.",False,1648044735.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1sifd2,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

My guess is by then even harsher sanctions will have been added, US drones have routed a few trenches, even more commanders killed, no one (not Syrians, not Belarusians) will be coming to aid Russians and they will simply retreat out of fear. 

Then the situation in the Kremlin will reach a breaking point and Putin will be dealt with. And then the order to withdraw will come. 

What happens to Donbas, Luhansk and Crimea I’m not sure. Seems like it would be difficult for Ukraine to take back even when Russia withdraws. Might be a topic of negotiation after Russians order withdrawal of troops.",False,1648042420.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1sip8e,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Also, if what you said is true, why mention Russian tourists then?

Why should Turkey close it's airspace? What has closing the air space actually accomplished, other than being symbolic? Don't mention the grounded aircraft, because if you do, I'll immediately know that you have no clue what you're talking about.

As a NATO member, Greece literally on live television showed every single drone manufacturing plant that Turkey set up in Ukraine, while the Russians were invading.

The Turks aren't playing both sides, this is a simplistic outlook on the situation.

This hard on for going after turkey while ignoring other nation's actions (or lack there of) is quite telling.

Turkey has been the most active member of NATO in the last decade when it comes to fighting Russia in various battlefields. In Syria, they basically guaranteed Russia would never achieve victory. In Libya, the Turks made sure Russian (and French) backed wannabe dictator Khalifah Haftar never gets into power and the UN backed government remains the main power in the country. In Azerbaijan, Turkey pushed Russian influence in the Caucasus out significantly, and basically made a corridor for any possible future NATO operation in the region.",1648044051.0,1648043661.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1sl98p,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Iraq had been in multiple recent wars and on paper it’s forces were large and formidable. We know now that technological superiority and air superiority are massive game changers for modern conflict.
Also - I’m aware of the more modern training methods us allies use. I’ve actually been in a mock village and used the (FISWES? Sommat like that) laser based hit system personally. But that is now and after our countries have been fairly consistently involved in large conflicts across the globe since the 90s.

>Although betavoltaics use a radioactive material as a power source, the beta particles used are low energy and easily stopped by a few millimetres of shielding. With proper device construction (that is, proper shielding and containment), a betavoltaic device would not emit dangerous radiation. Leakage of the enclosed material would engender health risks, just as leakage of the materials in other types of batteries (such as lithium, cadmium and lead) leads to significant health and environmental concerns.\[14\] Safety can be further increased by transforming the radioisotope used into a chemically inert and mechanically stable form, which reduces the risk of dispersal or bioaccumulation in case of leakage.

You can have a battery that lasts several years that's no more dangerous than a lithium battery. Problem is output of these batteries aren't great, so they're better used for stuff like remote web cams that you want to leave out for years.",False,1648013078.0,t3_tklhyv,t1_i1rdecb,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

As it stands right now - Russians are supporting this war. It makes no difference if they are brainwashed, afraid, proud, tired, supportive or simply stupid.

UK MoD: Russia 'likely reorganising before resuming large-scale offensive operations'

Hello, it is Martin Belam in London taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. In the last few minutes the UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its latest daily “Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine”.

They claim:

The battlefield across northern Ukraine remains largely static with Russian forces likely conducting a period of reorganisation before resuming large-scale offensive operations’

Would the east recognise that Mediterranean is a security issue for Spain, Italy, Greece? And would the Mediterranean countries recognise that Russia is a huge issue in the east? Regardless of WHY newer EU states were reluctant to accept migrants during the refugee crisis (it wasn’t ALL about racism, although sadly that did play a role too), the fact is also that for many people, the refugee crisis appeared suddenly and unexpectedly even though it had been a problem for the Mediterranean EU members for years by that time, just not in that amount.

You're forgetting that Crimea is 2/3rds ethnically Russian and only 1/6th ethnically Ukrainian.

There was a reason why the annexation went so well for Russia. Clearly the people of Crimea weren't resistant to the idea of joining Russia, at least in 2014. It was literally a region that was gifted to Ukraine under the USSR. 

>Donbas, however, has been infiltrated by (Russian) separatists... and those two nations - DPR and LPR - have declared independence some time ago. They can have it. They won't be part of Russia and form a nice buffer zone between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine can take this loss and it resolves hostilities in that area going forward. Recalling Putin's pre-war meeting, this was the main reason for initiating the invasion.

The issue is that the ""Russian separatists,"" were always known to be actual members of the Russian military. They called them ""little green men,"" or whatever, because they materialized basically out of nowhere. Russia didn't just provide material support to ""separatists,"" they provided man power and basically astro-turfed the entire thing.

Russia obviously plans on taking it. They just haven't had time to stage a referendum like they did in Crimea. Their recognition of that region as independent right before launching the invasion demonstrated that they were laying territorial claims to the region.

The rule is all members have to vote unanimously to accept a new member. Members are unlikely to accept a new member with active border disputes or occupying forces, because it could immediately draw NATO into an active military conflict. Applying nations receive an action plan, which instructs them to resolve border disputes (North Macedonia for example).
Second, none of the examples you provided were or are territorial or border disputes. Alaska, Hawaii, Guam didn't have disputes. France had colonies at the time of NATO formation and joining, but it was seen as an internal issue and France never received NATO support when those colonies sought independence. Ireland troubles were a domestic issue, and while there is historical context, it didn't become an issue until after NATO was formed. There's not a real process to remove NATO members.
Third, NATO was formed as a defensive pact primarily for defending European nations from Soviet encroachment or aggression. Remote disputes (Falklands or Vietnam) weren't a concern to the principle of the pact. Current days are different, as NATO is primarily used as a ""democracy and westernizing"" tool for promoting those ideas to nations once under autocratic regimes, basically integrating them into Europe. They get action plans to reduce corruption, have free elections and break away from Russian influence.

The NATO article I linked to classifies this particular exercise as 'strategic.'  
Military theory holds that there are different levels of war. A very common breakdown is Strategic/Operational/Tactical. When I say very common, I'm talking Clausewitz, widely regarded as the father of modern military study.  
Loosely speaking, the Strategic level is concerned with how a military is used in pursuit of national interests and the end result of a war. Operational, the middle level, deals with how large forces are used in a geographic region in support of the larger goals of the war. And Tactical deals with more proximate goals, on a shorter timeline, and at a lower level of fighting.  
In WWII, Roosevelt was responsible for the Strategic level of war, leaders like Eisenhower or Halsey were Operational, and company commanders or destroyer skippers were tactical. Just a rough example to help.  
If NATO is calling VOSTOK a 'strategic' exercise, they certainly feel it was designed to provide Putin with 'meaningful content.' Whether or not that happened, you or I cannot know.    
I have seen major NATO exercises firsthand. Certainly not at the strategic level, and perhaps not even at the operational level. But I can tell you the grunts I saw who took part in 'fire phobia' training were probably not going to accurately tell you why it was important for them to have molotovs thrown at their feet. That doesn't mean the training was 'meaningless.' It could just mean that they (or the person you spoke about) were simply at the tactical level, and anything above them was transparent.  
Finally, you should remember, NATO and Russia share observers for each others' major exercises.

Well, contracts are upheld by threat of punishment for breaking them. If the threat isn't there, the contract is less than meaningful. Russia doesn't need to be afraid to break contracts, since the world has all but broken every single one they've had with them already. All sides are breaking contracts, promises, and guarantees left and right.

Russia has all the power to amend any contract it pleases. It has the power to completely rewrite it.  You can't take them to court. You can't attack them. You can't punish them without punishing yourself in an even worse way. When they amend a contract, it's up to the other side to either agree or disagree with the new terms. Russia knows that too many countries depend on their gas and their oil for something like a broken contract to stop trade. 

So contracts mean nothing right now. Literally nothing. They can't be enforced. If they can't be enforced, they're no better than a gentleman's agreement. *After* the war is over, they will mean something once more...unless Russia falls. 

Estimates say that it would take an absolute minimum of a decade to safely move away from Russian gas and oil. That's too long to mean anything right now.
