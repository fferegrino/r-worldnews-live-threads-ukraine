Day 357-358 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The days have been getting less and less quiet recently. We had 2 missile strikes in the last 2 days, one strike per day, and the one from yesterday was at a weird time as well. It happened around 3am, which is not something new, but the last time they did a missile strike during the night was months ago, around the time when Russians were just outside of Kharkiv and we were still being shelled daily.

That missile strike was also weirdly small, they only launched 32 missiles, half of which was intercepted and the other half made it to their targets. Apparently, majority of those missiles were Kalibrs launched from ships in the Black Sea, but there were a couple of other plane-launched missiles as well. I’m pretty sure 2 of them were aimed at Kharkiv oblast, we heard the explosions from the city, but I don’t think we know what was hit, other than it being infrastructure.

There was another missile strike today and, as everyone can already guess, it happened at 11pm, their usual time. There were about 7 S-300 missiles, at least one of them malfunctioned and landed in Belgorod oblast, but other missiles did make it here and some of the explosions were very loud, our windows were shaking yet again. Not sure what they targeted specifically, but it wasn’t energy infrastructure as we had no problems with electricity following the strikes.",False,1676596888.0,t3_113hg14,t3_113hg14,,0,104,0,104,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 February 2023

* The Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) continue to deploy similar number of aircraft in support of the Ukraine operation as they have for many months. Russian sortie rates have increased over the last week, following several weeks of quieter activity. Air activity is now roughly in line with the average daily rate seen since summer 2022.
* Overall, Russian air power continues to significantly underperform in the war, constrained by a continued high threat from Ukrainian air defences and dispersed basing due to the threat of strikes against Russian airfields. Russian combat jets operate almost exclusively over Russian-held territory, preventing them from carrying out their key strike role effectively.
* Across Russia, the VKS likely maintains a largely intact fleet of approximately 1,500 crewed military aircraft, despite losing over 130 since the start of the invasion. However, it is unlikely that the VKS is currently preparing for a dramatically expanded air campaign as under the current battlefield circumstances it would likely suffer unsustainable aircraft losses.

The volume has been growing exponentially. It's been like drinking out of a firehose for a few days. The demographics in the obituaries are also different. For the first time I'm seeing an absolute flood of ethnic Russians from Russian majority regions. 

This is Putin's worst nightmare, and something he's been desperately avoiding all year. They burned through all the voiceless, and now have to throw their base into the meat grinder, the more educated base with access to the internet. These are all over Russian social media.

Let’s be clear. 

Russians aren’t “poorly trained, poorly led, poorly equipped.”  

They are untrained, not led, badly equipped. 

And they can’t change any of that. But they will keep throwing bodies into the morass.

The war in Ukraine has been accompanied by a ferocious battle of disinformation, waged in particular by pro-Russian agitators seeking to distort and shift the blame for many atrocities on the ground.

Here are some of the main narratives, false or misleading, that have been fact-checked over the past year by AFP's digital verification teams.

Russian authorities themselves have propagated the idea that some of the worst atrocities -- such as the massacre of civilians in Bucha not far from Kyiv in April 2022 -- were staged.

In this case, two clips of poor-quality video footage were used to imply that people were only pretending to be dead, which AFP was able to debunk thanks to its teams on the ground.

Many other videos have been spread widely on social media with similar allegations that some horrific crimes were staged.

But the accompanying footage turned out to be completely unrelated, such as a rap video, a sci-fi film or a Russian TV series.

Many of the accusations point the finger at the world's major media organisations. Countless screenshots have been shared on this theme, for example, claiming to show that CNN used old footage completely unrelated to the war in its coverage.

Other internet users have taken aim at television channels, accusing them of broadcasting images of people bandaged and bloodied, but only pretending to be wounded. In fact, they were very real victims of Russian attacks.

A flood of false claims online parrot Moscow's narrative that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is the head of a gang of ""Nazis"" or ""drug users"".

Thus, social media posts have been shared worldwide saying that a man covered in Nazi tattoos was a chief of police in Kyiv or that Zelensky had been photographed in a football shirt imprinted with a swastika.

The drug accusations have circulated alongside manipulated video footage of questionable quality, claiming to prove Zelensky's cocaine addiction.

Ukrainian refugees have also been targeted, particularly in neighbouring countries such as Poland and Slovakia.

Manipulated or misleading photos or videos have proliferated online purporting to show refugees as neo-Nazis, criminals or the source of trails of garbage on public transport.

Other misleading messages, shared in different European nations, claim that Ukrainian refugees are paid more in social benefits than pensioners or veterans in the host countries.

Another recurrent theme is the alleged betrayal of Ukraine by its neighbour and ally, Poland.

Thus, weather maps are manipulated to suggest that Poland wants to annex part of Ukrainian territory, or documents are falsified to show that Warsaw is planning to establish a protectorate in western Ukraine.

Other social media posts suggest that support for Kyiv is not as watertight as the West would like to believe.

There are photoshopped images of anti-refugee posters in Prague or Warsaw; manipulated photos of anti-Zelensky street art in major cities around the world; or fake front pages of the French satirical weekly, Charlie Hebdo, mocking Zelensky.

Disinformation has also focused on energy issues against the backdrop of Western sanctions against Russia, and skyrocketing oil and electricity prices.

In addition to countless incorrect claims about prices or supplies, posts say the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell wants to ban homes from being heated above 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit).

A massive campaign came to light in Europe in which leading news sites -- mainly in Germany but also other European countries -- were being imitated to pump out pro-Moscow messages.

The website of Germany's top tabloid, Bild, for example, appeared to feature an article about a boy killed in a cycling accident in Berlin after streetlights were turned off at night, as Europe's top economy faced an energy crunch.

But the news site and the article were fake.

I already know why I support Ukraine, it's not a position I need to remind myself of or defend.

But I truly cannot understand the Russian side of this.

Their singular route to a victory that isn't pyrrhic was the three day capitulation.  

Shortly after it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they had an easy off-ramp from the conflict by claiming they had finished 'denazifying' Ukraine and leaving.

At all points after that, there is nothing that can approach a win for them.

Any land they take by force is absolutely destroyed, and requires hundreds of billions of dollars of reconstruction before it can serve any commercially useful purpose for Russia.  In capitulation they gain instant control of commercially useful territory.

Any resources they take control of in this war that require development, already exist in the motherland.  Russia and Canada are two of the countries that stand to gain immensely from climate change.  Russia will gain additional useful resources and arable land in the coming decades.   They have millions of acres and trillions of dollars of undeveloped resources of their own.

Now tack on the direct expense of the conflict on Russia's part, the destruction of military capability, the cost of asset seizure and sanctions.

It literally does not compute.  I can not rationalize this conflict from the Russian side beyond the first month at all.  And that is why it's so scary to me.  You can say ""Russia's not insane they won't end the world over this""  But when the entire thing makes no sense, maybe they would.  Doesn't change what's right for us to do, but it's scary.

I can look at the actions of the CCP, Iran, or North Korea, and I can understand a rational path forward that they believe in, even if I disagree with it.

Russia and Russians are a good example of this.

In the 90’s and 00’s Russia was given a giant olive branch by Europe. In particular, France and Germany. They were given favourable trade conditions and there was also an aspiration the EU would be dominated by the three countries of France, Germany and Russia.

What did Russia do? They took the trade deals, and used their position to set up aggressive barriers against foreign intervention by French and German people. They then identified individual French and German politicians and executives they could influence through bribes or blackmail and used those assets to influence Europe’s police’s to favour Russia even more.

Russia interpreted the actions by France and Germany as an attempt to erode their power base and culture. They assumed France and Germany were trying to capture Russia as their own. So Russia replied in kind.

Russia basically saw the olive branch by France and Germany as a trade and espionage war.

Why? Because that’s what the Russians would have done. They assumed that these overtures were the EU trying to enslave them. From the Russian perspective it was the only logical explanation of France and Germany’s overtures. There is no room for concepts such as cooperation or mutual respect on Russian thinking.

Russia reveals itself by its actions. They don’t understand NATO expansion because if they were in NATO they would be using the pact to expand and control their neighbours. They don’t understand the EU because they would use it as a way to enslave their neighbours.

They don’t understand what the west is doing supplying arms to Ukraine. If it was Russia in this position, they would be using their military “support” as a means for taking Ukraine for themselves.

Russia is a nasty piece of work, even down to the individuals in it. They are a society that sees the world as either the rapist or the rape victim. The winner, and the person deserving empathy is the rapist. There is no value placed in human dignity, empathy or what we call respect.

Instead of respect being a fundamental human right, in Russia, respect is what you get when you are the biggest bully. “Respect” in Russia is what you and I call “fear”.

I hope that makes sense.",1676578706.0,1676571254.0,t3_113hg14,t1_j8sloa2,,1,41,0,41,0,0,

If you're feeling confused, it might mean your premises or scale of thinking is wrong. In this case, maybe you're taking something abstract, like ""Russia,"" and trying to fit it with human-like behavior and rationality, with an assumed purpose that this state works toward -- maybe total wealth or something. With those premises, the war doesn't make rational sense. 

But when we avoid those abstract ideas, things are clearer. Lets say you're a Russian capitalist or upcoming oligarch -- and this war could be great. If Russia wins, you can invest in a destroyed Ukraine to try to make buckets of money.

And of course, many other things far, far worse. What triggers it? Often, literally nothing, just boredom. She just likes hurting people to cheer herself up when she's in a foul mood. I've seen her do it to anyone she sees as beneath herself: call center staff, bank staff, shop assistants, etc. 

Why? Why would you bring someone into the world then try your hardest to destroy them? Why? 

Why lash out at a call center worker or a supermarket assistant to feel 'powerful' because you can hurt someone and get away with it? What's the point??? 

IMHO key to understanding Russia & the leadership of Russia and this war, lies in reading books about Narcissistic Personality Disorder and in particular the mindset of the Paranoid Narcissist and the Malignant Narcissist subtypes. 

It's also worth reading about sadism. Some people take genuine pleasure from hurting others the way that you or I would enjoy a delicious cake or a walk in the forest. Indeed they may also enjoy those other things too; they're not cartoonish villains, they have usually figured out that their secret little joy must be kept hidden or plausibly excused. 

> It literally does not compute. I can not rationalize this conflict 

indeed, that's how it goes

Many humans seek to cause harm for the sake of demonstrating their capacity to cause harm and for 'fun'. 

You cannot reason with such people. You cannot shame them. Unfortunately, all you can do is learn to defend yourself and try to build social and physical and emotional barriers to keep them as far away from you as possible. 

Unfortunately from experience I can tell you that calling out the narcissist or sadist  for their behaviour will not stop them, they will usually escalate, because how DARE something like YOU tell someone like THEM anything! etc

Russian society is essentially this personality type and outlook, at huge scale. 

> I can look at the actions of the CCP, Iran, or North Korea, and I can understand a rational path forward that they believe in, even if I disagree with it.

* Every time the West gave more, Putin escalated, which made the aid look less valuable in comparison.  That would have happened no matter when the West agreed to deliver more weapons, so they always would have looked like they were behind.
* Obviously the West was trying to balance risk of nuclear war with the deliveries.  That is a reasonable position.  They were also trying to make sure that logistics could keep up with what was being sent. Also reasonable. 
* Yes, Western decision making can be slow and bureaucratic, but they have moved faster and more decisively in this situation than I think anyone would have ever predicted a couple years ago.

The narrative that this is all being deliberately designed to prolong the war is, I think, clearly wrong.  It is an escalating conflict and is difficult to get far ahead of Russia until Russia literally runs out of people and weaponry to throw at this problem.  And the West is very interested in ending the war to get economies going at full force again.

There was a lot of unrealistic optimism following Kharkiv and Kherson. Unless NATO gets involved directly, most of winter, spring, and fall are not the seasons for curb stomping in a ground war. 

To be realistic, curb stomping probably isn't going to happen. Ukraine has a long way to go, through heavily fortified territory, that has now been occupied by Russia for many years. We don't the extent to which Russification has occurred in these territories. In Kharkiv, Ukrainian soldiers are met by welcoming happy citizens. This might not be case as Ukraine moves further into Donbass, or especially Crimea.

NATO urban warfare doctrine is to basically bypass cities. We will see if Ukraine employs this same strategy as their next offensive begins. Going into Donetsk and Luhansk cities, as well as many others could prove very challenging. The challenge for Ukraine in bypassing cities, is they will technically be depriving their own citizens of basic needs once Russian supply lines have been cut off.

If UA can hold as they have been they have not lost much in terms of ground and the strategic or operational situation hasn’t changed since RU started pushing. RU would have to do a lot more to shift momentum in their direction let alone force a situation where UA might feel like negotiating a peace on RU terms. That said, it’s not entirely clear how much UA would have to do to force RU to renegotiate and how capable they are of achieving some of the offensive aims suggested like retaking crimea. UA is waiting on more weapons to move and there’s likely a transition time in terms of weather and conditions between winter and spring that is not favorable to offense (I.e. mud).

Russia has not declared war. Under Russian law, conscripts are not supposed to be deployed outside of Russia, or sent into active combat without war being declared. By annexing regions of Ukraine, Putin can create a loophole in this law, but it doesn't appear so far that Russia has sent many conscripts to Ukraine. Declaring war would also give Putin more powers having to do with weapons production, but I'm not exactly sure what this entails. Declaring war would bring all sorts of problems for Putin, so it's unlikely this would happen without popular support for it inside Russia, or a very desperate Putin.

**Info**: What I'm talking about now assumes that Russia was completely defeated and occupied in another war.  It is currently very unrealistic that this will happen to Russia in this war. To do that, Ukraine would have to march on Moscow and conquer it and most of Russia, which is unrealistic and potentially suicidal.  A victory for Ukraine in this war, with the recapture of all the territories it owned before 2014, is unlikely to trigger this.  For that, the Putin regime would have to be completely replaced and they are not even guaranteed to lose power if they suffer total defeat in Ukraine.

However, I think the deindustrialization of Russia is rather unrealistic and not desirable, especially when they are completely defeated, Putin and his regime stand trial and Russia becomes a real democracy. (Currently I hope that they will lose huge amount of industry and they will most likely become something like Iran or North Korea in the next few years/decades)

But especially after they are completely defeated, we shouldn't pursue it anymore.

There was once a similar plan for Germany after WWII, the [Morgenthau Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan#).  

In addition to things, which were also done after Germanys defeat, like denazification or demilitarization, it also envisaged the dismantling of all factories in Germany, especially in industrial centers, put these deindustrialised areas under the UN control and prohibit Germany to reindustrialize itself again.  

This plan, however, was dropped, because it would have condemned the German people to be poor no matter what and potentially make Germany unable to feed its own people. It probably would have led to the starvation of a third of the German population. You need factories that produce fertilizer or machines for agriculture and forestry. In addition, too little fertile land was available to support the entire population.

It would probably also have led to massive resentments in the German population and lead to new tensions that would have massively outweighed the short-term security benefits.

I also doubt that Russia will only have defense forces, after it was defeated. I mean, look what happened to Germany.  

After igniting a world war that turned all of Europe into ruins and carried out an industrial genocide, it rearmed 10 years later and became one of NATO's strongest armies alongside the US during the Cold War  (It's different today, but it was the case back then).  

While I can imagine that Russia would no longer have nuclear weapons, it will probably have to rearm after a while because the former victorious powers (that defeated Russia) need all the support they get to fight a new enemy, who may even have been a brief ally, who helped to defeat Russia in the first place.  Who knows?  

Certainly, after Russia's total defeat, there may be eternal peace, but if history has shown us one thing, it's unlikely to come to that.  

After Napoleon, after the Great War, after World War 2 and after the Cold War, people always thought that there will now eternal peace and there will never be another war.

Do they? Didn't they vote for Yanukovych?   


>constitution doesn’t get changed on a whim by 1 man,

I little bit of an ironic statement considering the constitution of Ukraine gets changed everytime a new president gets elected and the reverted back whenever another president gets elected.   


>businessmen don’t fall out windows

Tell me you don't know about the history of Ukraine without telling me you know the history of Ukraine. There is a long list of assinanations of Ukranian politicians and prominent business men.    


>get to learn speak native language

Didn't they only add Russia as minority language in 2012 and take that away in 2018.   


>no puppet government like Chechnya,

  
The puppet government in Chechnya was who the west was supporting in the 90's. Are you saying we should support a new puppet govenment just because we don't like this one?  


> Russian troops (we see how they behave) won’t be stationed on territory

So was Ukraine not independent before this invasion? Because there was still Russian troops stationed there prior to the war in Crimea.   


>get to teach facts in school instead of propaganda,

You mean replacing Russian propaganda with Ukranian propaganda. I mean they treat Bandera as a hero... how you can sit there and tell me there isn't propaganda in Ukraine? It's pretty much propaganda just saying that. 

&#x200B;

>have proper journalism

Really in Ukraine? Was this ever a thing?  


>allowed to wear Ukrainian symbology flags et

  
I mean I'm pretty sure under even the most extreme puppet regime they wouldn't limit most Ukranian symbology. I think maybe the fascist stuff could possibly go.   


>can teach national songs in school

Is this really a positive? Creating nationalistic kids?  


>Most countries gdp has at least tripled since joining the eu (Poland and Romania)

I'm not sure if that is true. GDP per capita of Romania in 2007 when they joined the EU was $8360, now it's $14858. That's an increase of less than double. That's not much different to somewhere like Serbia, which is not the EU which have increased their GDP per capita from $5848 to $9230. It should be noted that Ukraine isn't anywhere near Poland, Romania or even Serbia in terms of their gdp per capita prior to the war, so I don't think we can even talk EU accession.   


Poland's gdp per capita has tripled, but that they joined in 2004. Prior to joining the EU and after the collapse of communism their gpd per capita actually increased 9 times!!!!! So on that trend it actually decreased in growth after joining the EU.

Completely shutting down all production in Germany? Do you have a source?

Because all the articles I found just said they were scaling back operations, none said they were totally leaving. BASF did shut down all operations in Russia. Not sure if you're confused or what. Plus BASF is scaling up production in China at a time when countries are looking to move production back to their own shores. It remains to be seen if large investments in China will seem wise depending on how world geo politics go, relations between the west and China only seem to be getting worse and they have their own economic problems as well.

And BSAF aside even with the latest energy issues Germany will still be an economic powerhouse in Europe, I think you're being a little over dramatic. Remember the price of natural gas is less now than when the invasion started. Obviously a slow down in the world economy would hurt them but then that hurts everyone else as well.

I bet that even if the country had enough food that they'd still impose rationing as a means to make the people compliant and subservient towards their ruling family. Controlling access to a person or animals food and controlling their hunger has a major psychological impact on the animal or person in question.  

The people get together in small groups and have to confess to wrong thoughts and actions. They have to rip each other apart and rat each other out for wrong thoughts and actions.
