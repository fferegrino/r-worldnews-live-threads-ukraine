Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 7 September 2022


- Over the last 24 hours, heavy fighting has taken place on three fronts: in the north, near Kharkiv; in the east in the Donbas; and in the south in Kherson Oblast. Russia's planned main effort is probably an advance on Bakhmut in the Donbas, but commanders face a dilemma of whether to deploy operational reserves to support this offensive, or to defend against continued Ukrainian advances in the south.

- Multiple concurrent threats spread across 500km will test Russia's ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces.

- Earlier in the war, Russia's failure to do this was one of the underlying reasons for the military's poor performance.",False,1662541402.0,t3_x7v2g0,t3_x7v2g0,,0,60,0,60,0,0,

This feels planned somehow.  We will Opsec Kherson, drag them in, keep it dark and then absolutely light them up on the Kharkiv front and show the world and the Russian troops what is happening almost on the Russian border.

Day 196 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled once, and it happened much later than usual, after the missile strike. They shelled us at 1am, and it was pretty loud here. They used cluster munitions because we heard a ton of small explosions after each medium explosion. And because we actually heard those small explosions, then it could mean that they were happening somewhere close to us, otherwise they are too quiet to hear from afar.

Actually from what I’m seeing right now they are firing missiles and shelling us at 1 hour intervals. They did a missile strike at 12am, three missiles were fired, two of them landed in Kharkiv and they were very loud. Then a substation in Belgorod exploded and cut off electricity in most of the city for the night, it actually might have been the last missile that didn't manage to get to Kharkiv, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Then they shelled us at 1am, and right now at 2am they fired their missiles at us again. I’m guessing they are really mad right now about their front collapsing, so of course they would take revenge on civilians.

It’s hilarious reading Russians’ cries about losing town after town on Kharkiv front. Just yesterday there was “no panic in Balakleya” and now they already lost it, if their propagandists are to be believed that is, which we probably should believe them, they never exaggerate their losses, only their victories. If they are actually talking about losing, then it’s serious, and they are probably downplaying it too. So I guess we should prepare for an entire night of missile strikes and shelling, it already happened 3 times so far.

> The situation at the front (as of yesterday evening):

> On the Kharkiv front yesterday, the enemy launched a long-prepared (judging by the movement of reserves) offensive, striking the main blow near the town of Balakleya. The outer perimeter of the city's defense was held by mobilized battalions of the LDNR (with very few heavy weapons), which, as expected, failed to deter the enemy at the front lines. Unfortunately, the second echelon units of the ""Rosgvardia"" also failed to hold (partly, as Vladlen Tatarsky bitterly hinted, due to their incompetence in using the weaponry at their disposal). As of last night, the enemy had managed to take the Balakleya garrison into an operational encirclement, capturing Volokhov Yar and Verbovka settlements.

> My sources, apart from the unfortunate lack of training of the Russian guards, also noted the extreme caution of the Russian aviation, which preferred to fire at the enemy from the maximum possible distance, which had a noticeable effect on the efficiency of the strikes. 

> Sources noted the remarkable boldness of the enemy's attacks - ""off the armour and wheels,"" seizing positions at high speed, rushing into them directly using armour and other equipment, as a result of which the artillery lost the opportunity to strike at the enemy when they approached our positions.

> I have no information that two units of the Russian SOBR were allegedly surrounded near Volokhov Yar. 

> Fierce fighting continued in the Kherson direction. Yesterday, the enemy again attempted (unsuccessfully) to advance near the village of Terny Podi. Fighting continued at the enemy bridgehead on the Ingulets river. The enemy launched another series of rocket attacks (with HIMARS rockets) against the crossings, headquarters and positions of the Russian troops. In Baratovka, the enemy attempted (unsuccessfully) to hit the headquarters of the 205th OMVBr.

""We are sure that 80 percent of the population will come to the referendum,"" Moscow-appointed deputy head of administration of Kherson region Kirill Stremoussov said, according to state news agency Tass. Stremoussov is no longer in Kherson, but in Russia - according to Ukrainian sources, other officials have also fled the embattled region. **The new date of Nov. 4 is symbolic; Russia then celebrates ""National Unity Day.""**

>Only on Monday, the occupiers announced a pause in preparations for the vote for security reasons. The Ukrainian army is currently fighting a counteroffensive to retake the territory. Previously, a date in the first half of September was considered a desired date. Thus, in the summer, the occupiers had expressed their intention to hold the vote in parallel with the regional elections in Russia on the second weekend of September.

The longer Russians desperately try to hold east bank of Kherson the worse it gets for them really overall. If they had any sense they'd retreat and they have enough troops from there to reinforce other fronts to stop the bleeding. Use the river in Kherson as defensive barrier with all bridges destroyed.

Just like we knew Severodonetsk and Lysychansk were gonna fall as soon as Popasna was captured months earlier as Russians got close to only supply route to that area the same is true in Kherson now. It doesn't really matter if it happens in a month, 2 months or 6 months eventually the difficulty of supplying east bank of Kherson is going to force them to fall back. The question really is what is there to gain for them delaying the inevitable, sure they can inflict some heavy casualties on Ukrainian offenses but if Ukrainian start being more careful and don't attack as fast as at the start (which seems already be the case) that benefit is also gone. Probably as usual in Russian military the only real gain is avoiding bad PR.

Kharkiv meanwhile is a real disaster unless they can move big reserves there really quickly. This is an area they could've easily defended if they had proper garrisons. If Ukraine can gain foothold in Shevchenkove and surrounding areas that is enough to constantly start barraging the Izyum supply line, eventually causing the collapse of that in similar way that is happening in Kherson now and what happened to Ukraine in Luhansk.",False,1662568624.0,t3_x7v2g0,t3_x7v2g0,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

They are far more likely to view TV propaganda with disdain and are more conscious of its manipulative nature.

So the Kremlin moved online and targeted social media and grass routes ""Style"" propaganda (read  AstroTurf). The concept is simple, young people want ""the truth"" and don't want to view ""propaganda"" so instead of an official RU channel, young people go to NEWSSLAVARUSSIAWARFUCKUKRAINE or some other similarly named telegram channel and read about the war there. They take slightly more objective view and even occasionally show a Russian failure or too, maybe a dead soldier or a town that Ukraine liberated. Doing so gives the impression that it's genuine on the ground information about the war, when in reality its still a highly tailored view of the war designed directly from the government.

Take for example popular Russian youtuber/video producer ""war gonzo"" who has been on the ground in Ukraine for months covering the war from the Russian perspective. His videos appear to an outsider with little experience of war as real upfront footage, some of his videos even showcase real fighting, explosions and death. Though importantly those clips are all from drones that were recorded by someone else... he just re-uploads them. All his clips are interviews or B-roll footage of soldiers ""fighting"" or ""clearing a town"". They are staged productions, and that's not even just a theory. In one video he forgot to edit out him giving acting cues to a DPR soldier who was operating an anti-aircraft gun in the background. This is just one of many many examples of Russia's new social media campaign, designed at keeping people inside the system thinking they're getting ""the  real scoop""  and not looking else where, particularly foreign sources, for outside information.

The Institute for the Study of War reports that Ukraine's counterattack in Kharkiv on Sept. 6 was likely an opportunistic effort enabled by the redeployment of Russian forces away from the area to reinforce their positions against the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kherson Oblast.

Obituary data on Russian soldiers suggests Russia deployed elements of the 147th Artillery Regiment of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division of the 1st Guards Tank Army to Kherson Oblast no earlier than late August.

This is the first time ISW has observed elements of Russia’s elite 1st Guards Tank Army operating in southern Ukraine.

The key takeaway is that thanks to the Russian long-range capabilities the ordinary Russians don't really feel the reality of the war, and in order to significantly reduce the public support for the war it has to be brought closer to them.

 In rare public comments Ukraine's military chief warned on Wednesday of the threat of Russia using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which would create the risk of a ""limited"" nuclear conflict with other powers.

The war in Ukraine that began with Russia's invasion on Feb. 24 was likely to rage on into next year, General Valeriy Zaluzhnyi said in an article co-authored by lawmaker Mykhailo Zabrodskyi and published by state news agency Ukrinform.

The article contained by far the Ukrainian commander-in-chief's most detailed assessment of the war to date, and gave starkly contrasting messages to those given by top Ukrainian officials. read more

""There is a direct threat of the use, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons by the Russian Armed forces,"" Zaluzhnyi said.

""It is also impossible to completely rule out the possibility of the direct involvement of the world's leading countries in a 'limited' nuclear conflict, in which the prospect of World War Three is already directly visible,"" the article said.

Moscow has in the past denied speculation of potential nuclear or chemical weapons use.

**TURNING TIDE**

Ukraine will need to match the strike range of Moscow's weapons in order to turn the tide of the war, Zaluzhnyi and Zabrodskyi wrote.

""The only path to a cardinal change in the strategic situation is undoubtedly a series of several consecutive, or ideally simultaneous, counterstrikes by Ukraine's armed forces during the 2023 campaign,"" they said.

The United States has supplied the Kyiv government with sophisticated long-range weapons on the condition Ukraine would not use them to hit targets inside Russia, according to U.S. officials.

The article contained Ukraine's first acknowledgement that it was responsible for what the authors said were rocket strikes on Russian air bases in annexed Crimea, including one that damaged the Saky military base last month.

Until now, Ukraine refused to publicly acknowledge its involvement, with a senior official speaking on condition of anonymity citing fears of Russian retaliation.

""We are talking about a series of successful rocket strikes against the enemy's Crimean air bases, first of all, the Saky airfield,"" the article said, using language that did not clarify whether that meant unguided rockets or missiles.

The Saky strike took 10 Russian warplanes ""out of action"" on Aug. 9, the article said.

Ukraine is not publicly known to have weapon systems in service with a sufficient range to hit Saky, which lies at least 200 kilometres from the front lines.

**NO PEACE THIS YEAR**

The article's tone contrasted with often optimistic statements by senior Ukrainian officials.

""The length of the war is already measured in months, and there is every reason to believe that this time period will extend beyond 2022,"" it said.

Zaluzhnyi and Zabrodskyi conceded that Ukraine was positioned ""extremely unfavourably"" on two eastern frontlines, around the towns of Bakhmut and Izyum.

Foreign-supplied weapons will make up the backbone of Ukraine's defence next year, they said.

""In 2023, the material base of Ukraine's resistance must remain significant volumes of military aid from our partner nations,"" the article said.

Maksim Katz is a russian opposition blogger, one of the best in terms of quality and analysis. His videos are in russian but have English subtitles (not auto-generated). Also very high quality.

He often talks about future of Russia without putin, a lot of analysis on russian authoritarian regime and how it will fail. And often gives some accurate predictions on the war.

From the day 1 he said that russia’s war is doomed.

Here is one of the recent interesting videos (Is putin running out of shells?), but you can browse his channel and find more, including about what Kherson will mean for the war

This leads to a lot of curve-smoothing, i.e. 45 KIA for 10 days in a row then 110 KIA for the next 25 days, but it seems to be reliable at predicting what the next US/NATO estimate will be - namely that, however accurate they are, they will be around the 30k mark.",1662592722.0,1662592143.0,t3_x7v2g0,t3_x7v2g0,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

Ukraine still crushes Kherson, just a little slower. Why Ukraine is able to do this is because they simply have more soldiers. A similar situation developed in winter ‘42-43 on the Eastern Front.  Russians actually launched two offensives: one around Moscow and one around Stalingrad. Why we don’t hear about the Moscow one was because it was a failure since the Germans deployed their reserves there. But they didn’t have any left for Stalingrad, hence the German defeat there. Almost 80 years later, we have an eerily similar situation, but now the Russians are finding themselves in the German’s position: overextended and facing manpower and supply shortages as a determined and numerically superior enemy is using lend-leased weapons to decisively push them back.",False,1662590404.0,t3_x7v2g0,t1_inibejr,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

Russia responded by doubling down and pouring even MORE soldiers and materials into the trap that literally everyone could see.

So Ukraine said ""Huh...ok then uh...carry on I guess."". And then once Russia's military finally seemed to realize their idiocy (the day the command in Kherson quietly pulled out), Ukraine dropped the hammer.

Well there's always the possibilities of;

1) Idiots or undertrained personnel who don't know how to use the equipment

2) Drunk or incompetent leadership

3) Some process failure somewhere along the path of picking useful targets, getting approval to strike, and passing along coordinates. Or else the process takes long enough that targets are no longer there by the time the strike arrives.

4) Some Ukr intelligence operation to deliberately breaking that process

5) Absence of good targets at the front for missiles (why waste an expensive missile on an artillery piece that will be moved by the time the missile arrives?)

6) Deliberate choice to prioritize civilian or dual-use targets over troop positions or deterring movements

7) Bureaucratic issues incentivizing striking *something*. E.g. a local commander gets a shipment of munitions every week, and if he doesn't use them up, the higher-ups will start asking questions. The leaves him the choice to a) try and hit (but miss) front line targets, b) dump unused weapons somewhere and hope they aren't found, c) fire them off to a random location, or d) hit *something* in the city he's fighting to take

8) They actually are finding and trying to hit priority targets in the city, including equipment, logistics sites, etc

1. Europe just plain freezes to death; 
2. Europe stops supporting Ukraine and perhaps even pressures it to surrender, thus allowing an aggressively expansionistic country to gain more territory right next to it and confirming to it that it can use the ""we'll cut the gas supply"" threat whenever it wants something against Europe's interests; 
3. Europe intervenes directly militarily against said expansionistic country - which, after all, is currently struggling badly against *one* country of comparatively limited means - and forces it to re-establish its gas supply/pay reparations? 

To be clear, I don't support 3. at all at this time: it would be a horrible mess, far more painful and harmful for everyone involved than the gas supply crisis itself.

Or at least empower the voices that want to force a peace deal sooner rather than later - while there's still a window to hold gains.

And 4) Ukraine has been using American air launched anti radiation missiles to degrade and destroy Russias air defenses, Russia doesn’t seem to have this same capability and so control of the airspace is slowly turning in Ukraines favor. Amassing a concentration of air defenses behind the offenses and the degraded nature of Russias own means there isn’t much they can do in that area.

It is a concern that highlights a certain distrust in Berlin of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And that, too, is a reason why the defense industry in Germany has not been authorized to deliver battle tanks.

I think the German support has been a bit waffling on heavy weapons but I'd say the main factors in their reluctance is a mix of the escalatory effects but also that the German army is poorly equipped even if their MIC handles a lot of exports so there's doubts they could provide all the tanks / parts.

So there's no way Germany would be the first to send Leopards imo. Maybe some other country sends older versions but I feel like we are more likely to see Abrams before any Leopards directly from Germany.

This new success at offensive operations might encourage more tanks in general though.

The usual bs coming out of news outlets on the war in Ukraine will involve:

1. Stagnant/slow war.

2. Ukrainian ground lost (how much Russia controls)

3. Equipment or Russian military advantages (e.g artillery numbers)

4. Russian gas/energy cutoff to EU/EU winter.

So let me briefly debunk or explain each point and why I'm personally positive about Ukraine's chances with a little bit of a wrap up.

1. Stagnant/slow war. Actually, it isn't, and where it is it's actually Ukraine doing really well and Russia doing poorly. The war has gone on for 6 months, stagnation brings to mind a frozen conflict. This is not a frozen conflict, the last few months has been Ukraine shaping Russian forces for their counteroffensive. In essence it's the pendulum swinging to Ukraine's favour.

Ukraine doesn't have a large manoeuvre force and crippling advantage over it's opponent. So it's counteroffensive will be slow and methodical.

It's defence was Defence-in-depth and then attritional withdrawal (I forget the technical term for second one but it's basically the same ethos); let your enemy advance and overextend and then take out the logistics and supplies, then once the battle lines have become more fixed, bleed the enemy until you need to withdraw and do so. The whole ethos is to bleed Russia dry for every inch of ground. To those who don't understand war and strategy, this looks like a stagnant conflict. It isn't, it's just attritional and a great move when you are at an equipment disadvantage but on the defensive.

2. Ukrainian ground lost. See 1. and also Russia has gained so little since April. Most of the ground they hold they seized early on in their attack. I think it's something like 1-2% gains in 4 months. So effectively Ukraine is holding off a 'superior' enemy while mobilising and training her 700k+ soldiers and giving western supplies time to arrive. All this while Russia is unable to effectively mobilise or replace losses. Very good trade.

3. Equipment disparity. It's not the number, it's how you use it. Even with the older Soviet stuff, Ukraine hit enemies and key targets, Russia hits hospitals, refuges and civilian targets.

The quality for Ukraine is on the rise and culminated with HIMARS which small in number but high in accuracy and proceeded to gut Russian ammo stockpiles and other command/logistics hubs.

This was shaping for the offensive as well as giving Ukrainian defenders some respite.

4. Russian energy cut-offs. This is such a stupid line of reporting. It will hurt many EU countries this winter but the EU is a modern and rich part of the world. They will coordinate and get through. And beyond this winter things will get better, with Russia being pointless as early as winter 23/24 or at latest 24/25. It's a one-time play that is an own-goal for Russia.


And as for things currently. The Ukrainian offensive has begun, it will be slow and people will die.

But the fact that there have been advances across the theatre is a very good sign.

Aside from an unlikely imminent Russian collapse (but I hope for one), it will take months for Ukraine to reclaim her territory but it is likely to happen.

Ukraine has consistently demonstrated better troop quality, better command quality, better tactics and smarter theatre-level decision making while not wasting her troops lives.

At some point, Russia is completely screwed, but the simple fact that they are on the defensive and haven't been able to mount effective offensive operations for months, and arguably significant ones since April is a very good sign for Ukraine.

Kherson will take a while to take but without effective supplies, it's a matter of time before Ukraine wins it back.


So, my last thought - try and ignore the noise, hyperbole and unqualified analysis of most media outlets. I would advise looking at ISW, and analysis from Gen Hertling and Mick Ryan.

M101 is similar to soviet 122mm in range and usage, so it would make sense for infantry support applications, especially if a constant supply of ammunition can be provided. Maybe it's part of switching from soviet to western artillery for lower calliber guns, who knows?

The fact that it was designed during ww2 doesn't make much difference if it was properly stored. At the end of the day, a cannon is a big metal pipe on wheels.

China, Turkey and India) to face responsibility for the effects of their trade and hold them accountable for the cost to Ukraine.

It seems people in America do not understand the root causes of their infrastructure problems. Infrustructure is not being maintained because cities and states, in many cases are bankrupt. A lot of this has to do with the American way of life, the suburban family home. 

You need to spend a significant amount of money on maintaining the infrastructure for such large amounts of land while the population on those pieces of land is quite small. So there are two solutions, significantly raise the taxes for people living in suburban housing (to compensate the amount of money it costs to support their required infrastructure) or start moving people out of suburbia into townhouses/apartments.

Then you go after comms and surveillance infrastructure.  You reduce the enemy's ability to eat and shoot, then their ability to speak, see and hear, and then when they are tired and blind, you attack where they are weak.  
  
You attack like water - intentionally avoiding heavily defended areas, knowing that if you can maintain initiative and control battlefield conditions, that you will force these once-fortified troops to meet you on terms they cannot control, or risk being encircled.  As you do this, you build off each maneuver - you are more concerned at this point about maintaining initiative than holding ground.  Where you find success, you press harder, and where you meet resistance, you pull back.  Before long the enemy is in disarray, and that's when you throw your reserves at the weakest points, hoping for a real breakthrough.

As I said to another commenter - it's not just finding new suppliers. It's the price. LNG shipped from the US and north africa, and gas pipelines from Azerbaijan and Norway can help make up some of the volume shortfalls. But not at the same cost. Not yet. It's why wholesale electricity costs are up by up to 10x this summer compared to two years ago for some of the more exposed member states.

The official name of Europe's plan to be off Russian energy imports by the end of the year is called ""[Save Gas for a Safe Winter](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_4608)"" plan. That name alone should prevent anyone from brushing this off as some kind of already solved problem or non-issue. It's a short term plan to *cope* with gas supply cuts, not to replace them.

The plan is;

1 - use coal/nuclear/wind/whatever they can get their hands on during summer so they can stockpile gas for winter. And climate change be damned, ""Where possible, priority should be given to switching to renewables or cleaner, less carbon-intensive or polluting options. However, switching to coal, oil or nuclear may be necessary as a temporary measure"". While some member countries have succeeded in filling up their gas stores, others have been struggling with reductions in hydropower due the drought, lower than expected wind generation, higher usage due to heatwaves, and ill-timed maintenance on nuclear plants.

2 - immediately slash gas demand by 15% until Spring. Last year the EU Parliament had settled on a 30% demand reduction by 2030, which was going to be dependent on a large package of mid- to long-term energy efficiency measures and incentives. They are now communicating that hitting this goal in the next year will depend on ""Achieving immediate energy savings through voluntary choices"" that range from individual to industrial. They are also make recommendations to member states such as ""\[m\]andate a targeted lowering of heating and cooling in buildings operated by public authorities"". They've warned of possible [rolling blackouts](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20220907-europe-prepares-for-energy-crisis-as-russia-reins-in-natural-gas-supply).

Even then, they're saying that this isn't a silver bullet. This is there to buy time to negotiate new joint supply agreements, build or expand shipping terminals and transport capacity, and get partners to ramp up deliveries. Some, but not all, of that will be in place by March, when they expect the gas reserves will be used up and need to be replaced by the new deliveries.

In the meantime, national governments have been bailing out electrical utilities that have been forced to pay high grid prices, and subsidizing consumers with aid. Just three days ago Germany alone announced 65B euros in such aid - the third and largest such measure since Scholz took office, now up to 95B.

They can't do this indefinitely. My original point was that the longer this goes on, the more people will compare their energy bills and other rising costs with the breaks they get from their government, and they'll wonder if all of it is worth it. During the Blitz and after Pearl Harbor, Brits and Americans listened to FDR and Churchill to find the resolve and strength of purpose to accept rationing and high prices as a patriotic duty. Will Europeans today feel the same way when Sholz and von der Leyen and Macron make the same case, especially considering that it's not *them* getting bombed? Many will. But over time many won't. Which is Putin's goal when he tries to turn up the heat - to hasten it enough on the margins to make a difference and put pressure on their elected officials. Heck, the west thought sanctions would stir up enough discontent among the oligarchs and the Russian people to dissuade Putin from invading. Is Putin's strategy any more/less misguided?

&#x200B;

>By next year, once the moral issue of being dependent on Russian exports has evaporated the pressure is going to switch to countries (esp. China, Turkey and India) to face responsibility for the effects of their trade and hold them accountable for the cost to Ukraine. Russian oil and gas is not going to appear so cheap if it comes with proportional demands, tariffs and seizures.

Let's hope so.

India never really seems to give a shit and aligns with whoever suits them at any given time, since there' seldom any consequences. Historically, the more western powers imitate the British Empire and try to coerce India into supporting their geopolitical goals, the more closely they align with Russia. And vice versa. If the west really wanted to influence them, dollar for dollar they'd get better compliance from lavishing aid on Pakistan than on sanctioning IndianOil executives.

As for China, well relations are already at quite a low point, particularly with the US. Their master long-term plan was already to build up low-cost land-based shipping routes through Asia as a bulwark against the possibility of being embargoed or blockaded by American allies at ocean shipping chokepoints in east Asia. If the west followed through on threats of consequences for dealings with Russia, it would likely accelerate those plans, rather than push them to disengage. And frankly, the only reasons they haven't made a move on Taiwan yet is because 1) they're still no match for the US navy, so long as they stay out of range, and 2) Chinese gov stability depends on managing the relationship with the west - to keep the flow of investment dollars coming in and exports going out to keep a billion people satisfactorily employed, and not rioting and setting fire to their local CCP secretariat. But if they think they can change the economic and strategic calculus, well this war might get a lot bigger before it gets smaller.

The issue isn't whether Europe can source alternative suppliers. It's about the price. It doesn't do anyone any good to pretend that Europe isn't in the midst of an energy crisis right now, and who ultimately pays for it until it's resolved. I'm not saying that Europeans won't take those costs in stride, just like their grandparents did the last time Europe went to war. The question is how much and how long.

This isn't some crazy fringe defeatist idea. In 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea, 40% of Germans said they should just legally recognize it, and 46% disagreed that Germany should respond with sanctions even if it caused economic pain at home, despite a large majority blaming Russia for the conflict. At the time, half of Germany wasn't willing to take economic pain to stand up for Ukraine.

Secondarily, I don't think anyone knows at this point how much of the RuAF exists only on paper. Maybe even they are not aware of their actual strength, or the lack of. This is made worse by HIMARS, which have very much wreaked havoc on their supply lines indeed; the russian forces were compensating for their shortcomings by massive artillery bombardments, something which they can hardly do once the forward ammunition depots go up in flames... so the shortcomings are no longer hidden by endless stream of shells over the front.

Realistically, you can give them all the weapons you can think of, but this is a learning progress and there are going to be a lot of casualties, especially since Russian casualties have gone through the roof at the same time.

This offensive is going to be rough, and it is going to be costly in every way, and there is only so much you can do to avoid that.

However, they are still very much on the move, on two different fronts, and have potentially scuppered the Russian Donbass Offensive by forcing a major campaign outside of Kherson, which has also left the Russians trying to defend Izium with a mixture of special forces and riot cops.

Aircraft Carrier x1	1.470 billion

Carrier Air Wing x1	1.140 billion

Arleigh Burke Class Destroyer x2	0.36 billion

Attack Submarine	0.19 billion

Ticonderoga Class Cruiser (Pg. 55) x2	0.42 billion

I'm going to go on a leg and say the entire strike group will cost more (upfront and annually), but I was still impressed by the cost of just one ABCT. Thinking about the 3 ABCTs in both 1AD and 1CD, that's just short of 20 billion per year.

A carrier strike group (CSG) is a type of carrier battle group of the United States Navy. It is an operational formation composed of roughly 7,500 personnel, usually an aircraft carrier, at least one cruiser, a destroyer squadron of at least two destroyers or frigates, and a carrier air wing of 65 to 70 aircraft.

Let's say, hypothetically, Russia largely loses the war in the East.  Their invasion force threatens to rout, and they they go pure defense (maybe a healthy distance back on the Russian side of the border).  Despite that, they continue to maintain that Crimea is **Russian** territory, and refuse to negotiate.

They have a big chunk of territory to defend.  It's not economically independent, and their *only* overland route is a 20 mile bridge.  Realistically, they'll be fairly dependent on boats for resupply, both of military equipment and civilian goods.  They might even have to truck in water.

This is a *bad* situtuation for Russia, even if the Ukranian military doesn't attack.  They have a pile of sanctions *and* the cost of trying to keep Crimea running dragging down their economy.  They might eventually be able to outlast the world's patience with sanctioning them and hang on to Crimea, but it'll be hard without the ability to intimidate Ukraine into dropping the issue.  

The Ukranian military isn't going to just idly sit by though.  Russia would have at least a 250 mile front to defend, with Ukranians doing their best to pick off a few Russian soldiers here and there.  They'd likely have a long range firepower advantage unless Russia can really step up their missile production (unlikely with sanctions).  Even if they can pack enough defense forces to make that stretch unassailable, the *defenders themselves* are a target.  Ukraine can probably blow up ~100 Russian soldiers a day with long range weapons.  Drones, rocket artillery, maybe even guided artillery if Russia doesn't have the force projection keep them back.

Can Russia politically withstand 100 soldiers lost a day for a year?  Can they convince Russians to live in Crimea, knowing that there's a hostile military just *waiting* to break through?  Will Ukraine start showing up with even *nastier* stuff on loan from the US?

 What every indication? What military history do I need to be aware of? When was the last time Americans had to fight a ground war with a peer to peer enemy? Am I supposed to take war games at their face value? Poles did a war game before the invasion started where they estimated their army would collapse against a Russian onslaught within a month. How likely does that result seem now?

 BECAUSE USA's ground fight ability IS obscured by their Air Power - we don't know that they're the be all end all authority on teaching Ukrainians how to fight on the ground.

But I'd posit that as while he might have been persuaded once or twice, but as the war dragged on, Hitler became increasingly overtaken by his megalomania/paranoia - basically he was convinced that he knew better than his trained staff.

In general Hitler was pretty convinced that if he gave orders, his underlings would follow those without a second thought. At the same time, his order to never yield  was interpreted with a *lot* of leevay at first - eg Feldmarschall Kluge intrepeted his orders as ""*do not yield ground unless it means that troops are wiped out*"". Which is quite a bit different than **never** yielding ground. 

Anyhow, as the war turned out for the worse, Hitler grew increasingly convinced that he was better at wartime tactics/strategies than his generals.

The point is precisely getting a visual image of *averages* and the general trend from start to finish.

Why?

and they are used all the time. You assume it won't rain when you leave the house without a umbrella. Is that wrong to to? Are we wrong to listen about climate change and whatnot because certain thing didn't happen yet and are only ""assumptions""?

Far more accurate then extrapolating from data points from before circumstance changes. Its is not comparable.

Averages are useless when the situation has changed and you don't have a data point for that.

Well thats a blatantly misunderstanding of my argument. Estimates based off intellgience are far more reliable and trustworthy then guess extrapolated from those same numbers. It isn't about getting it down to the exact dead Ivan.

Actually their numbers right now are based off of nothing because of the change in intensity and the lack of data point.

Averages are the most useful when situation changes. If changes are sustained, that is shown by an averge increase. Otherwise it can just be a hiccup.
 
Plainy put, if in some particular day 1000 russian soldiers are KIA, the overall effect on the war could be negligible.
If 200 more (than the curret average) are KIA daily, for more than 5 days (e.g.) precisely that average increase is the one that will make an impact. 

It also contradicts this:
>It isn't about getting it down to the exact dead Ivan. 

How is the changed situation important if pinpoint accuracy is not? 
The Ukrainian counteroffensive started in earnest a week ago. Before that we had 6 months of war with varying numbers of KIA. How is a week going to change the average over 6 months? Is there going to be such an increase in KIA that it will raise the average for the last 6 months above the current point? 
Why do you assume that?

>Actually their numbers right now are based off of nothing because of the change in intensity and the lack of data point. 

You either refuse to understand that this is outside the scope of the graph or you simply don't understand averages. The current increase in KIA is irrelevant. It's been going on for too little time. And it can't be sustained ad infinitum. What matters is not one week or two of increased KIA, but a sustained (high) average.

23541285f4b695d2b9ebe65e1f610748,x7v2g0,injjoc5,"Sigh... against my better judgement I'll engage one last time.

Counterpoints -

1) The rate of attrition during the initial stages of the war were higher than they are now. The deadliest days for Russia (according to Ukraine) were ~1000 deaths during the initial first few days. Since then we've had several weeks of operational pauses by both sides, where the number of deaths for Russia has dropped as low as ~50. Just because the rate of attrition has increased over the last week doesn't make the line of best fit an inaccurate predictor.

2) By my cursory look online, there's been at least 5 KIA updates by the US DoD since the war started (March, April, May, July, August), not 3.

3) All statistical models suffer from low confidence levels until a certain threshold of data points is reached. If you want a 90%+ confidence level with a prediction interval (range) of say +-500 KIA you need X data points, if you want >95% confidence level you need X+Y data points, and if you want 99% confidence level you need X+Y+Z data points. 

Why does this matter? Because just because your model has a lower number of data points doesn't mean your METHODOLOGY is invalid. All it means is that your prediction interval for your desired confidence level is going to be larger than might be desirable until you get more data points (s-value or R-squared).",False,1662606923.0,t3_x7v2g0,t1_inj8vaf,,3,0,0,0,0,0,

Yes but you need a data point from the period of the changing situation. You cannot extrapolate from previous numbers because they are no longer accurate to this situation.

> How is the changed situation important if pinpoint accuracy is not? The Ukrainian counteroffensive started in earnest a week ago. Before that we had 6 months of war with varying numbers of KIA. How is a week going to change the average over 6 months? Is there going to be such an increase in KIA that it will raise the average for the last 6 months above the current point? Why do you assume that

Again another micharacterisation of the argument. I'm saying from the counter offensive period the rolling averages are no longer accurate. We cannot make assumptions based off numbers before that. The average losses over the 6 month period can change significantly depending on the new data. 

> You either refuse to understand that this is outside the scope of the graph or you simply don't understand averages. The current increase in KIA is irrelevant. It's been going on for too little time. And it can't be sustained ad infinitum. What matters is not one week or two of increased KIA, but a sustained (high) average.

I think you don't understand. You cannot make assumptions over a period with no data. Thats what OP has done from the counter offensive. We do not know how long the intensified fighting and increase in KIA will last. You assume for the sake of your argument it will only last 2 weeks.. Im saying until we get a data point from this period any assumptions on KIA extrapolated from previous data is not useful.

> Up to now you haven't provided any substantiation for why OP's tool is ""useless"" and should be dismissed, just that ""its useless"" based on that fact you don't like assumptions.

Except I have. I have shown that their numbers for this period are based off of nothing. That anything they've plotted for this past two weeks isn't worth anything. You've only said it's useful because you like looking at graphs lmao. Which is not even the argument.
