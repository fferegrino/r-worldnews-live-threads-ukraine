Their best chance of winning this was February last year when Ukraine was at its weakest and least prepared. Russia are now trapped in a war against an implacably hostile and resolved enemy, there is really no way forward for them and their only real way out is the total humiliation of withdrawal and loss of all the territory they stole since 2014.

But the worst bit is every month the balance of force tips a little bit further against them they pointlessly expend more lives and money and the potential humiliation and domestic backlash gets more severe when they finally do pull out. They lose more trained troops, they expend more of the soviet reserve of equipment and Ukraine gets a bit stronger, gets a bit more advanced weaponry and brings more NATO equipment online. They are increasingly pitting uncomprehending terrified mobiks against some of the most advanced death dealing technology the western military industrial has to offer, and soldiers who started out as highly motivated volunteers willing to fight and die for their country but have now also been trained and equipped to NATO standard. 

And given the volume of support and the extent to which it is spread out across different countries and political persuasions there is not really any realistic prospect its going to stop.

Translation:

The ""Fabergé Line,"" built all winter, with its trenches, ramparts, and trenches with concreted pillboxes, turns out to be completely useless in this situation. The enemy (all of a sudden!) is not a fool and forces ours, still capable of fighting back, to take up defensive battles in places without such fortifications. Where it is advantageous to him, and where ours can not retreat.  

The most acute problems at the moment are the shortage of artillery APCs, full-fledged army UAVs with competent calculations, and the shortage of a working army EMP capable of effectively combating the entire spectrum of enemy UAVs. Soon they will be joined by an extreme shortage of experienced and motivated infantry.

Many people these days, looking at all this, began to wonder, ""What is this? Stupidity or betrayal?"" Not only is the question very belated, but it is not correct.

Stupidity and incompetence are the perfect primary ground for treason and infiltrated agents. The February Revolution of 1917 will not lie.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 May 2023.  


* On 03 May 2023, several uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) struck Russia’s Seshcha Airbase, 150km north of the Ukrainian border. One An-124 heavy transport aircraft of Russia’s Military Transport Aviation (VTA) was likely damaged.  

* Seshcha is a hub for the VTA in western Russia and has played a major role in enabling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia also uses the site to launch Iranian-produced one-way-attack UAVs towards Kyiv.  

* The VTA is a well-resourced element of the Russian Air Force, essential for transport across the vast country. Russian leaders will be concerned that Russia’s air defences continue to be compromised, holding at risk key strategic assets such as VTA bases.

We battle not only against Lukashenka’s tyranny but also Russia’s occupation of #Belarus. Like the brave Ukrainians, we are fighting for our freedom.

The fight between tyranny and democracy, between the past and the future, unites us. Ukrainians and Belarusians have made a clear choice for freedom.

There is no question; we must win. If we lose, darkness will once again fall across Europe. 

Our interest in joining the Council of Europe is about securing a future where every Belarusian can live freely, speak openly & participate actively in the political life of our nation.

It's not merely about international recognition. It's about transforming our society & establishing a true democracy, where the rule of law prevails & human rights are respected.

I envision a Belarus where the principles upheld by the Council of Europe are not distant ideals but everyday realities.

Why is it suspicious?  

Well first off, even the homeless were staunchly anti-Russia. They were observed taking the lead with the Molotov cocktails...after all, they collect bottles for exchange.  They might’ve been drunks, but they still didn’t want to be invaded...

Second, there haven’t been any homeless there in 6+ months.  The Russians took them by force many months ago and forced them to dig trenches.  

They think it’s FSB, doing an awful job of trying to be incognito.

It’s reported that they pretend to hate the Russians, say Slava Ukraini, etc, looking for UA-sympathizers.  Then when find, return with authorities to point out the suspected “waiters.” (Waiting on Ukraine.)  Hardly anyone has fallen for the stupid scheme.

Translated text in tweet:

>1/3
>On the tragedy that happened the day before. Let me remind you that 4 vehicles were lost in 2 minutes. 11 people [dead]. I can say that it has not gotten any clearer. Ministry of Defence is silent.

>There are two main versions.

>The first version is the usual operation of the Laos* air defense [Laos = Russia, Laos is used to avoid discreditation punishment] in the panic mode of ""kill everyone - God will sort into friends and foes in the other world.""

>Due to the fact that a year later, the system of state recognition, or as it is also called the ""Friend or Foe"" system, more doesn't work than does, and nothing has been done about it so far, I do not exclude that its creators, manufacturers and controllers are already without exception all Heroes of Ukraine at least in the rank of colonel with great numbers in the [bank] accounts.

>It's good that there is no war, otherwise they would all have to be shot, but now, everything is fine. All according to plan. Eliminate shortcomings, distribute state awards.

>2/3
A worse explanation is that in Laos, in principle, nothing works properly, and an occasionally working system of state recognition is a given that everyone has come to terms with.

>The second version is that it was the enemy's air defense. There are rumors in its favor, but no facts have been provided yet. The range and height of the strikes of one of the targets eliminates almost all the air defense systems that the enemy and NATO have, except for the Patriot and S-300, taking into account the assumption that the battery operated from the line of contact.

>A AIM-120 is a possibility, but not really.

>The definite reason and the culprit will be clear when they find the remnants of warhead missiles. These will make everything clear. But there is a nuance. If the Laos air defense shot them down, then it will be necessary to transfer someone to another higher position, or even fire them, so that the striking elements may never be found, or more ""suitable"" ones will be found. Roughly the same thing must be done if the Laos air defense is innocent.

>To miss an air defense system battery at the contact line, you have to try very hard.

>3/3
>Our options are shitty in both cases:

>If it was the enemy, then the Laos Air Force lost the ability to work safely with JDAMS up of to 500kg and with Kh-29 missiles, lost the ability to work with pitch-up strikes and ATGMs. And having learned about the effectiveness of such batteries, the West will soon provide plenty of them to the enemy.

>If this is not the enemy, then it's even worse. It is impossible today to fight using aviation, serious UAVs and air defense systems, without a reliable Friend or Foe system, not in kamikaze mode.

>Alas, I'm talking about Laos, of course we don't have this.

Lukashenko has just fallen ill. I'm not sure what with, and part of me is sceptical it is actually a coup attempt. It would have been very convenient. Apparently he was in Moscow for the 9th of May parade. Did he fall ill then or before? And with what? Everything when it comes to dictator health unless documents are leaked is pure speculation. The main thing I have trouble convincing myself of is the need Putin would have to annex Belarus. It is already basically annexed. There is nothing left to gain, no more juice left to squeeze out of this orange so to speak. They have already stripped the army bare of assets. The only other resource is men, but there are plenty of those in Russia already. And I can't imagine that conscripting Belarussians to use as cannon fodder would go down very well there.

Translation:

The ""Fabergé Line,"" built all winter, with its trenches, ramparts, and trenches with concreted pillboxes, turns out to be completely useless in this situation. The enemy (all of a sudden!) is not a fool and forces ours, still capable of fighting back, to take up defensive battles in places without such fortifications. Where it is advantageous to him, and where ours can not retreat.  

The most acute problems at the moment are the shortage of artillery APCs, full-fledged army UAVs with competent calculations, and the shortage of a working army EMP capable of effectively combating the entire spectrum of enemy UAVs. Soon they will be joined by an extreme shortage of experienced and motivated infantry.

Many people these days, looking at all this, began to wonder, ""What is this? Stupidity or betrayal?"" Not only is the question very belated, but it is not correct.

Stupidity and incompetence are the perfect primary ground for treason and infiltrated agents. The February Revolution of 1917 will not lie.

[Source: CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/05/politics/russia-jamming-himars-rockets-ukraine/index.html)

The HIMARS rocket launchers, which the US began supplying Ukraine last summer, radically changed the situation on the front. They are used to destroy supply bases in the russian rear, played a key role in the success of the autumn counteroffensive.

But in recent months, the effectiveness of the use of HIMARS missiles has decreased, five representatives of the United States, UK, and Ukraine told CNN. russian troops use REP to knock down GPS targeting systems.

russian state media reported in December that their air defence forces had received new software that allows them to shoot down HIMARS missiles, citing a unit commander in Zaporizhzhia.

Although a missile can hit a target (including one that has significant inertia) even with a muted GPS signal, HIMARS have recently begun to miss increasingly often, a Ukrainian source told CNN, information from drone operators on the front lines.

One of them called the disruptions, as a result of russian interference, ""significant"" - he had not observed such a thing until November. According to another operator, the effectiveness of HIMARS has decreased significantly.

Anyway, Ukrainian military experts, with the help of American counterparts, are looking for ways to bypass russian obstacles, ""it's a constant cat-and-mouse game,"" the Pentagon representative said. Such methods include redesigning the software of the guidance system and the missile itself.

In addition, the U.S. is helping Ukrainian forces locate and destroy russian EPP assets. Such activity has a ""high priority,"" according to one of the leaked Pentagon documents. In total, the US supplied Ukraine with 18 HIMARS systems and promised another 20.

This is especially true given the leaked pentagon info on Ukrainian AD (most other cities/areas in Ukraine are reliant on old s-300s AD with low ammunition stocks remaining which would be easier to target).....

Hence when it was about the war with Ukraine they didn't want to join it, leaving Luka unable to join the war with Ukraine. By killing Luka Russia would destroy its strongest piece in Belarus, thus causing issues for themselves.

It's also unlikely that Luka would disagree to Belarus being annexed by Russia. Even if he was against it, without him Russia wouldn't be able to annex Belarus either. This is because of the threat of a public revolt, especially with the possibility of Belarusian military also joining into that revolt. Russia doesn't have the soldiers available to control Belarus under such circumstances.

Ukraine signaled its intent to join but NATO has very strict requirements about the political makeup and integrity prospective members, among other things. Ukraine's attempt to join was denied because the country was rife with corruption. As much as Zelenksy had done, there was still massive corruption within Ukraine's political system that wasn't being addressed. Remember when Yuriy Lutsenko, Prosecutor General of Ukraine, conspired with Rudy Giuliani to have the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed because her anti-corruption activities were causing him problems?

I think Zelensky was on the fence about being more aggressive with the anti-corruption push. I think the whole arm-twisting by Trump was a wake-up call (i.e., Ukraine would never be more than another Belarus to the US unless they became more like the other European nations; western liberal democracies.) Once Biden took over Zelensky started taking action and, fearing its waning influence, Russia promptly invaded.

Ukraine isn't done with its anti-corruption push, so they wouldn't be a shoe-in even if the war ended today. I do think they're well on the way and both Zelensky and the Ukrainian people realize that it's better to be in Europe's sphere of influence than Russia's. It might take several years, once the war has ended, but NATO accession is surely going to be the end goal of the West.

But, there's no need to wait until Ukraine is in NATO before selling them jets and bombers and all sorts of other goodies. I expect we'll see an end to the conflict following by Ukraine being heavily armed with Western weapons, a continuing anti-corruption push, accession into the EU, NATO application, eventual NATO accession.",False,1684142524.0,t3_13hwzuq,t1_jk7ll8h,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

Because encirclements are complex military maneuvers that require coordination and fast moving vehicles. Russia likes to say that they’re the second most powerful military in the world but the reality is far different and many or Russia’s best troops who might of been capable of conducting encirclements were already lost earlier in the war. Russia didn’t encircle Bakhmut because they couldn’t. 

As far as “suicide waves” those aren’t really a thing in modern war. In order for an infantry assault to work they need air support or artillery support. If you don’t have that support then the defender will rip you to shreds with artillery and mortars and then when the survivors get within a couple hundred meters the assault rifles and machine guns will clean up what’s left. Maintaining order and getting people to keep advancing when everyone around them is easier said than done.

Even assuming a scenario where a year from now the Republican party is in and the frontlines haven't shifted (lets pretend the offensive never happens), Putin can't just say ""we win now"" and leave it at that.

Ukraine isn't going to just stop fighting, its existential to them. The US may cut its support, but the EU and UK is still heavily, HEAVILY in favour of backing them. Ukraine won't be having major offensives without the US, but they can definitely make it a devastating war of attrition for Russia with just the EU and UK.

Just look at Bakhmut as is, Russia's offensive capacity is already gone. They're throwing countless bodies at the problem for the slightest gains. There is zero chance of them having a large scale offensive that takes any key cities they can use as a victory claim any time in the near future.

So this raises the question, if its a slow war of attrition, how long will this go on for? One year? Two? Five? Ten? How will the Russian economy fare over this time? What about that massive deficit while the EU pivots away? What about the labour shortage from the mass exodus of males and countless war dead? What if another mass protest kicks off in Belarus or, god forbid, an annexation sparks a second front in the war? What if four years run by and a pro-Ukraine US government gets back in?

>Britain promised to supply “hundreds of attack drones” capable of operating at a range of 200km, although this description did not match any known UK capability, and the Ministry of Defence refused to give any extra details as to what was on offer.

>Speculation centred on whether the drones are a 3D-printed suicide drone made by the UK defence company QinetiQ. A press release from the company referring to them was removed from its website in February after it was picked up and reported on by a specialist publication.  

And from the more in [depth article](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/clandestine-u-k-program-developed-3d-printed-suicide-drone-for-ukraine):  
>At the same time, while the United Kingdom is known to have transferred a considerable number of drones to Ukraine — at least 2,000, including loitering munitions — as part of its aid effort to that country, there have been few details as to the particular types supplied. It is possible that at least some of the drones supplied already are of types or configurations that were specifically designed for Ukraine.

>Some of the drones provided to Kyiv by the United Kingdom so far include “unmanned surveillance systems” of unknown type, cargo-carrying logistics drones, autonomous mine-hunting vehicles, as well as 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones, the latter as part of a deal in collaboration with the Norwegian Ministry of Defense.",False,1684205265.0,t3_13hwzuq,t1_jkbgyd5,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Losing a German army group to the Soviets, including substantial allied forces, at Stalingrad used up the last of Germany's offensive strength.  After that they no longer had the extra men and equipment necessary for large scale offensive action while also defending the territory they already held.  


Kursk in '43 proved that the German's couldn't pull together enough forces to turn the tide of the war, and it was simply a fighting retreat from that battle till the end.  


It's actually pretty rare for the turning point battle of a war to happen over an immediate strategic objective.

Also there is the very good chance that they might have captured Stalin in the process of taking Moscow.  Stalin resisted leaving Moscow when it was under threat, and if he was captured or killed, it would have fractured the Soviet government.  Thanks to Stalin's purges and very heavy handed authoritarian style, there really were no 'middle managers' in the USSR at the top level with any personal authority.  It would have been chaos and division between those left, all while the German army bore down on them.  


But yeah, there are many scenarios where simply taking Moscow in 1941 would not have brought victory to the Germans.  My appraisal is that if the Germans had taken Moscow, it would have required them to have done several other things that would have knocked the USSR out of the war or at least removed it as a peer level threat.

bec638c4487c0b7266d923968719f978,13hwzuq,jkbpdfd,"Ever hear about Operation Paul Bunyan?

It was prompted by an axe murder of two soldiers over a small tree on the border of North and South Korea. 

The goal of the operation was to cut down the tree. You really have to read what they brought to the party:

>	Operation Paul Bunyan was carried out on August 21 at 07:00, three days after the killings. A convoy of 23 American and South Korean vehicles (""Task Force Vierra,"" named after Lieutenant Colonel Victor S. Vierra, commander of the United States Army Support Group) drove into the JSA without any warning to the North Koreans, who had one observation post staffed at that hour. In the vehicles were two eight-man teams of military engineers (from the 2nd Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division) equipped with chain saws to cut down the tree.

>The teams were accompanied by two 30-man security platoons from the Joint Security Force, who were armed with pistols and axe handles. The 1st Platoon secured the northern entrance to the JSA via the Bridge of No Return, while the 2nd Platoon secured the southern edge of the area.

>Concurrently, a team from B Company, commanded by Captain Walter Seifried, had activated the detonation systems for the charges on Freedom Bridge and had the 165mm main gun of the M728 combat engineer vehicle aimed mid-span to ensure that the bridge would fall if the order was given for its destruction. Also, B Company, supporting E Company (bridge), were building M4T6 rafts on the Imjin River if the situation required emergency evacuation by that route.

>In addition, a 64-man task force of the ROK Army 1st Special Forces Brigade accompanied them, armed with clubs and trained in taekwondo, supposedly without firearms. However, once they parked their trucks near the Bridge of No Return, they started throwing out the sandbags that lined the truck bottoms and handing out M16 rifles and M79 grenade launchers that had been concealed below them.[4] Several of the commandos also had M18 Claymore mines strapped to their chests with the firing mechanism in their hands, and were shouting at the North Koreans to cross the bridge.[13][14]

>A US infantry company in 20 utility helicopters and seven Cobra attack helicopters circled behind them. Behind these helicopters, B-52 Stratofortresses came from Guam escorted by US F-4 Phantom IIs from Kunsan Air Base and South Korean F-5 and F-86 fighters were visible flying across the sky at high altitude. F-4Es from Osan AB and Taegu Air Base, South Korea, F-111 bombers of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, were stationed, and F-4C and F-4D Phantoms from the 18th TFW Kadena Air Base and Clark Air Base were also deployed. The aircraft carrier USS Midway task force had also been moved to a station just offshore.[6]

>Near the edges of the DMZ, many more heavily-armed US and South Korean infantry, artillery including the Second Battalion, 71st Air Defense Regiment armed with Improved Hawk missiles, and armor were waiting to back up the special operations team. Bases near the DMZ were prepared for demolition in the case of a military response. The defense condition (DEFCON) was elevated on order of General Stilwell, as was later recounted in Colonel De LaTeur's research paper. In addition, 12,000 additional troops were ordered to Korea, including 1,800 Marines from Okinawa.[6] During the operation, nuclear-capable strategic bombers circled over the JSA.

This will adapt the programme used by UK pilots to provide Ukrainians with piloting skills they can apply a different kind of aircraft. This training goes hand in hand with UK efforts to work with other countries on providing F16 jets

Maybe they could do it, Russia has large internal army, but moving that to the frontlines could put Putins security in serious jeopardy. But the Belarus army in arms is not nonexistant and IF they have will to fight back, the country is quite large to be occupied effortlessly. You can run into the center but your logistics will be completely vulnearable, meaning that it can last only week or two until annihilation. They have not been willing to fight besides Russian army and i bet the willingness has not been exactly rising as of lately.

Russia has destroyed their land army and all that is left is in Ukraine completely bogged down + the conscripts reserves there. I take the odds of 13000 soldiers winning against 50 000 conscripts who are in attacking any day. Their equipment levels are pretty much the same now and Russia has no ability to conduct combined arms with air either so it would be purely scattered mechanized with crappy conscript light infantry.

Being a colonial power is not right or fair, so comparing the UK to other colonial powers is a choice between who was worse. It's not an opportunity to be a poster boy of fairness and righteousness.

The UK government refuses to apologize for it's role in slavery. This is from just a couple of weeks ago:

> What is considered fair and right changes over time, but judging behaviour based on what was seen as right _at the time_ shows the UK in a good light.

Oh boy. Here's a mix tape of British colonial atrocities. In no way we're these things considered fair or right at the time, and I have no idea how you could be so cruel as to say that these paint the UK in a good light:

- Kenya: 1.5 million people put in concentration camps in the 1950s, where they were subject to torture and rape. This is AFTER Hitler's concentration camps. But it was seen as right and fair at the time, according to you. 

""[T]he horror of some of the so-called Screening Camps now present a state of affairs so deplorable that they should be investigated without delay, so that the ever increasing allegations of inhumanity and disregard of the rights of the African citizen are dealt with and so that the Government will have no reason to be ashamed of the acts which are done in its own name by its own servants.""

—Letter from Police Commissioner Arthur Young to Governor Evelyn Baring, 22 November 1954

""There is something peculiarly chilling about the way colonial officials behaved, most notoriously but not only in Kenya, within a decade of the liberation of the [Nazi] concentration camps and the return of thousands of emaciated British prisoners of war from the Pacific. One courageous judge in Nairobi explicitly drew the parallel: Kenya's Belsen, he called one camp."" - The Guardian

My father was alive at this time; it's not some far off event lost to history. You're telling me concentration camps in the 50s with torture and rape, and to which their were no represcussions, is fair and right? It paints the UK in a good light? 

You had the concentration camps for Boers too, where 1/6th of the Boer population was rounded up and put in camps (mostly women and children), and about 25% of them died. 

Then of course you have the Amritsar massacre, where peaceful protestors in India were blocked into walled gardens are fired upon until the soldiers ran out of ammunition, killing and injuring over a thousand people. That was fair at the time though, right?

Then you have the Irish and Indian famines. A quarter of the Irish population died, and a quarter emigrated. The British government did nothing, while charities, even including native Americans, contributed food and money to try help, because THEY knew what was right and fair. The Bengal famine, where food was taken from India while famine swept the country, killed between 12 and 29 million Indians. Churchill said about the famine, in 1943 mind you, when everyone was appalled at what Hitler was doing, “I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion. The famine was their own fault for breeding like rabbits.” 

But again, somehow, you are able to look upon events like these, and write to me with a straight face about how this was fair and right at the time, and how it shows the UK in a good light. It's disgusting really, and I'd ask you to question why, if it was so right and fair and good, is the colonial era glossed over so heavily in your schools? The answer: they don't want you to know about all the fucked up shit your country did, so they just sweep it all under the carpet.",False,1684145003.0,t3_13hwzuq,t1_jk7vbwh,,5,-6,0,-6,0,0,

> EU funds are not meant to act as a influencing power of Brussel or anybody else.

I'm not sure where you got that idea. The EU's primary leverage is the size and power of its collective economy, and one of the biggest perks of being a member is being able to directly benefit from that massive economic base. That is in and of itself a form of influence, albeit one that the EU generally prefers to frame in a positive light (""do X for us and we'll pay you"") rather than a negative one (""do X for us or the payments stop"").

Depends entirely on the scale of the disagreement and how long it lasts. Rough patches in a relationship are normal and tolerable, but if my married life has been miserable for a while and seems likely to remain miserable for the foreseeable future, I'm getting a divorce so I can go find a worthwhile partner that brings some positivity to my life.

The other big question that has to be answered about Ukraine taking Crimea though is will the Crimean population see Ukraine as liberators or occupiers?  Crimea was always the most pro-Russian part of Ukraine.  Russia's forced deportations of ethnic tartars and other native Crimeans and resettlement of ethnic Russians over the decades, has given Russia that advantage.  Ukraine might have to forcibly deport hundreds of thousands of people in order to de-Russify Crimea.  How is that going to be seen by the west?  It's easy to say we'll all be fine with it, but you're talking about families that have been there for decades in many cases, and the forced removal of people never looks good.",1684197727.0,1684197267.0,t3_13hwzuq,t1_jkb0wes,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

None of them have record saying funds will be stop if we decide we don't like your behaviour towards funding Ukraine or your voting history. Unless I missed something than feel free to highlight my ignorance.

>Do they say that funds cannot be stopped in case of political disagreements, or are you asserting that laws which do not state that funds cannot be withheld somehow prevent the EU from legally withholding funds?

They do not say that funds can be stopped in case of Hungarian country voting as they wish, no. EU can always find a reason , even unlawful one to stop funds, but that's exactly what I'm saying, unlawful, wrong and nothing else than buying votes and punishing those that vote ""the wrong way""

>>That is all correct, but again, nobody ever said that after joining EU you have to vote the way we want you or finds will stop.

>I'm not sure what you expected, frankly. If you join a union then fail to remain a member in good standing, then you lose the benefits of being part of the union. That's just how the world works. 

No, it isn't it how world works between partners and you almost got it with wife and husband metaphor.

>>Yes, you are correct. Maybe divorce is needed. Maybe separation or other actions, but you don't cut funds because of the reasons we talk about.

>That's the EU's decision to make as a collective. 

Oh yes.

>>I think EU needs serious talk with Hungary that can lead to serious consequences, but i disagree it should be done as said earlier, buy removing funds because Hungary is not submissive or otherwise disobedient.

>What other consequences do you propose? Like I said earlier, the EU's primary leverage is economic. Making payments and withholding payments is how they get shit done when purely diplomatic means fail to get results.

EU is attractive because of the economic strength you described, but again, it has nothing to do with buying votes or punishing those who vote the wrong way 

>>I'm comparing witholding funds to other forceful methods Russia used. 

>What methods would those be? 

Throwing out of window for a start. Works very well to stop opposition and create one thought. Yes, again, that was hyperbole but I already said why I used it.
