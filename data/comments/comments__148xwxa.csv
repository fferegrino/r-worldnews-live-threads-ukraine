>
>*At a bar in a once-occupied Ukrainian village, dehumanizing messages on the walls were a stark reminder that the Kremlin wants to stamp out Ukraine and its culture.*
>
>In the four and a half months that Russian forces had occupied a village in eastern Ukraine, the troops had used the local bar as a small outpost, gutting it in the process.
>
>In the bar’s back room was a twisted blueprint of the minds of some of the rank-and-file who make up the backbone of the Russian military. The soldiers had turned every wall into a handwritten message board of phrases, rhymes and expletives.
>
>“It doesn’t count as a war crime if you had fun,” one line said, a smiley face drawn beneath. And in a rhyme on the same wall: “With a happy smile I will burn foreign villages.”
>
>Much of the writing in the bar in Velyka Komyshuvakha struck a decidedly different tone. The barely legible scrawls focused on dehumanizing Ukrainians, a grim staple of warfare, and reinforced that the Kremlin wants to stamp out Ukraine and its culture as part of its invasion.
>
>“Behind us the house is burning — well let it burn — one more-one less,” one phrase on the wall said.
>
>“It was awful,” said Svitlana Mazurenko, one of the 70 or so current residents of Velyka Komyshuvakha, which once had around 500 people before many fled. She had read the writings in September, days after the Russians retreated, and confronted the text again last month as she helped clean up the bar, known among locals simply as The Bar.
>
>Little is known about the soldiers that manned the bar, which they renamed Bar 100 in black spray paint, possibly for the Russian code for ammunition. A skull and crossbones and the phrase “MAKE WAR NOT PEACE” in English were also painted on the exterior.
>
>The writings on the interior suggested that these troops were not demoralized Russian soldiers under the impression they were there to “liberate” its people, a term commonly used in the war’s early days. These troops, at least the ones who wrote on the wall, seemed to be there to conquer.
>
>“We need the world, preferably all of it,” one wall entry said. “Victory or death!” said another.
>
>One soldier wrote, “God will help and we will help Ukrops meet him,” using an insult (literally, “dill” in Russian) to describe Ukrainians. “Mow the Ukrop,” read another line.
>
>This type of language is frequently seen in propaganda and, in more recent wars, on social media. Rarely is evidence of it found so clearly as a battlefield artifact.
>
>Ms. Mazurenko said the Russians had lived in most houses nearby and stolen from them, ravaging them in the process. But they couldn’t steal from hers: It was destroyed by artillery before the Russians entered the village.

Respect for our soldiers, respect for the relatives of our soldiers, respect for the wives and husbands of all those who stood up for the defense of the state - this is unconditional. Gratitude to these people is unquestionable. Ukraine knows how to be grateful, and it is worth showing it - every day.

Thank you to everyone who fights and works for our victory. I especially thank everyone who, in the battles in the East and South of our country, is opening up a strategic space for Ukraine, a space for movement towards victory. Thank you to everyone who is now both on the offensive and in the defense, who is storming the positions of the occupiers and who is repelling their assaults. Thank you to all of you, warriors, for your bravery, for your resilience and for every meter of the result!

Glory to our heroes!

These attacks, which began in February 2023, targeted government agencies and IT service providers in Ukraine. We can also now attribute to Cadet Blizzard the destructive WhisperGate wiper attacks against Ukraine detected by Microsoft in January 2022 prior to Russia’s invasion.
>
>Cadet Blizzard typically breaches its targets by using stolen credentials to gain access to internet servers that sit on the perimeters of an organization’s network. Once inside, it seeks to maintain access by using broadly available tools called web shells, which can be bought as off-the-shelf kits and customized. It then uses “living off the land” techniques – that is, it commonly uses legitimate commands, not malware, to move laterally across its targets’ networks while gaining access to more information or disrupting networks if it chooses. The use of “living off the land” techniques help it hide in legitimate network traffic, making its activities harder to detect.
>
>Cadet Blizzard is active seven days a week and has conducted its operations during its primary targets’ off-business hours when its activity is less likely to be detected. In addition to Ukraine, it also focuses on NATO member states involved in providing military aid to Ukraine.

The last couple of days haven’t been quiet, as the missile and drone strikes have continued to happen pretty much every day.

They only launch a couple of Shaheds per attack in our region, but when they attack a city like Kyiv, they send 10+ drones at a time.

There were a few attacks directed at Kharkiv and our suburbs recently, they used both drone and missiles to attack us. The last one happened just yesterday during the night, they sent a couple of Shaheds and sadly not all of them were intercepted, at least one of them hit a warehouse. There were videos from inside of it after the attack and there was nothing military related inside, so Russians were targeting civilians yet again, but thankfully there were no casualties. They also hit Tsyrkyni with missiles a couple of days ago, we were able to see the smoke from the city, and the explosions were pretty loud too. As usual they targeted residential buildings, but I don’t think there were any casualties.

While thankfully there were no casualties from attacks aimed at our city, the attacks they launched at Kryvyi Rih and Odesa are just enraging. They hit a 5-floor residential building in Kryvyi Rih and killed at least 12 civilians, with many more being injured. Then they attacked Odesa the next day and targeted a food warehouse (where they killed 3 people), a business center, some restaurants and many other civilian targets.

Over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed what had become apparent in the preceding days: the Ukrainian offensive against Russia had commenced. The nascent campaign is being conducted across a broad front, with Ukraine’s armed forces attacking the Russians in the south and the east of the country. So far, according to the Ukrainian government, seven villages and 90 square kilometres of territory have been liberated.

The Ukrainians must execute a campaign that recaptures large parts of its territory. It also needs to result in the destruction of a large proportion of Russian forces in Ukraine so they cannot conduct offensive operations in the near future. Finally, the Ukrainians will want to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin that this is a war he cannot win.

The initial phase of this offensive will also be designed to prod the Russians to act. In their early attacks, the Ukrainian armed forces will be wanting to prompt the Russians to unveil units and headquarters that the Ukrainians haven’t found in their pre-offensive activities, or to force the Russians to move their reserve forces and allow them to be targeted. Russian headquarters and logistics will be important targets as these provide the unified command, and supporting wherewithal, for the Russian defences in the south and the east of Ukraine.

As has been the case for the war so far, there is a profusion of information about these activities provided by an array of sources. As the Ukrainian offensive proceeds, I would propose several principles for those who wish to observe this war from afar.

First, understand that in military operations first reports are almost always wrong. In combat, people experience tunnel vision and often misunderstand what they are experiencing. Most participants in warfare have a limited view of what is actually occurring. For this reason, initial reports are always listened to but treated with caution until additional verification is available. There have been many initial reports about success or failure in this offensive. We should remain wary of these in the short term and not rush to judgment about the overall success or otherwise of the Ukrainian offensives.

Second, it is impossible to assess the progress of a war, or even a single battle, from a picture or video. While amazing technologies bring us a deluge of images from the war, they are poor tools for assessing the operational or strategic situation at any given time. A single photo on social media is like viewing the war through a very narrow straw. One photo over the weekend, showing multiple Ukrainian armoured vehicles damaged and stationary, was used as evidence for a multitude of different assessments. It was just a snapshot of a single Ukrainian company at a single place and time. When observing the war at a distance, time is required to assemble many different data sets from varying sources to ascertain the direction of the conflict.

Third, avoid the fallacy of certainty. Despite the enhanced transparency of the modern battlefield provided by a meshed network of military and civilian sensors, human will cannot be viewed remotely or through social media. When events are viewed in real-time, it does not mean we understand the reason they are being conducted or the level of resistance or courage that either side possesses. The fog and friction of war, explored by Carl von Clausewitz in On War, is every bit as relevant today as it was two centuries ago when Clausewitz wrote his book. There are no certainties in war; beware of those who predict definitive outcomes.

Finally, strategic patience is essential. These kinds of operations often unfold slowly at first, and then, as they generate tempo, can evolve very rapidly. We must be patient over the coming weeks. In saving their nation, the Ukrainians are attempting the most difficult form of military operation possible. They are not working to the comfortable timelines of the Western media or commentators.

There have been many comparisons between the Ukrainian offensive and Allied offensives in the Second World War. In August and September 1944, British General Bernard Montgomery proposed to Supreme Commander Dwight Eisenhower that they eschew the agreed plan for a “broad front” assault on Germany and instead adopt a single, narrow thrust into northern Germany. It would be led by Montgomery and employ almost all the available Allied combat divisions.

Eisenhower did not approve of this plan, primarily for logistical reasons. But adopting this narrow front approach would also have meant the Allies had limited ability to exploit opportunities elsewhere. Eisenhower’s decision proved correct; the Allies were able to exploit opportunities across the front and they won the war. The Ukrainians will be hoping their current broad-front strategy for their offensives also delivers them victory. But only time will tell.

They slowly try to corrode Russia's ability to resupply and reinforce their positions until something breaks.

It's not the most exciting way to wage war but it's the best way to handle things while minimizing loses.  Don't expect another Kharkiv.  Things might be slow for a few weeks but then, suddenly, lots of things will change because Russia will lose the ability to adequately defend its positions.

>Congressional Support for Aiding Ukraine Frays Amid Spending Battle

>A strong and longstanding bipartisan consensus in Congress around providing huge sums to aid Ukraine’s war effort is beginning to fray as a pivotal counteroffensive against Russia is underway, and as Republicans bent on slashing federal spending gain traction in their efforts to limit or block future military assistance for Kyiv.

>Right-wing House Republicans have long opposed U.S. support for Ukraine, but until recently they lacked the numbers to thwart any aid packages, which have sailed through Congress with the support of a critical mass of G.O.P. hawks — including the party’s top leaders — and Democrats. The bill that passed this month suspending the debt ceiling set spending limits that strengthened their hand, and increased the political pressure on Speaker Kevin McCarthy to keep a tight lid on federal expenditures.

>It also intensified the skepticism to new aid for Ukraine among some progressive Democrats, who were angry that the fiscal agreement capped spending on domestic programs, such as education, housing and food assistance, while it allowed military funding to continue to grow. They are now hinting that any future assistance to Kyiv must be accompanied by more nonmilitary spending, a nonstarter with Republicans.

The rest of the article indicates that the balance still remains in Ukraine's favor, but that growing opposition especially in the House is going to make things more difficult. It will make upcoming elections all the more critical for any voter that wants Ukraine to keep being supported.",False,1686776142.0,t3_148xwxa,t3_148xwxa,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

In the end the Entente broke the line and pushed the Germans back not with a fast moving war of motion like in previous wars but rather by analyzing the weaknesses and then moving up slowly, consolidating gains and then moving up slowly again. This was part of the 100 days offensive which ultimately ended Germany’s hope of having a negotiated stalemate to end the war.

In many ways modern defensive lines are still built using the basic defense in depth structure that the Hindenburg line used. They are designed to stop rapid breakthroughs but the fact that more resources are held farther back also creates a vulnerability to slow moving incremental progress. I don’t know what the right strategy for Ukraine is but for those of us watching from afar I think it’s important to remember that sometimes the best move looks very different than what we might imagine and just because we might hope for a rapid collapse of Russia doesn’t mean that’s necessarily the best option to pursue militarily (although it still might be).",False,1686783077.0,t3_148xwxa,t3_148xwxa,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

The video was shared Tuesday via Orchest Wagnera, its unofficial Telegram channel. Prigozhin’s press service confirmed Tuesday he visited Ulyanovsk together with Viktor Bout, the former Soviet military officer and convicted arms dealer released in a prisoner swap with US basketball star Brittney Griner.

Prigozhin previously said Wagner fighters would be replaced by regular Russian forces in the Bakhmut area and relocated away from the front lines.

e56acdd1cfcd683be52c30bcd03e08f5,148xwxa,jo2uzch,"Regarding the nightly missile/drone attacks, and if they will continue. It's important to not underestimate their symbolic achievement, particularly when we ask ""what happens after the war?"". Russia is clearly about to lose much of the territory taken in 2013, perhaps even Crimea over the summer. But that may not signal the end to this conflict. The drone and glide munitions, for example, are very cheap. Russia, supply issues or not, can absolutely sustain the ""nightly"" attacks on Kyiv or other civilian centres indefinitely. 

NATO AA can mostly cope and that's great. What each attack successfully delivers, however, is the message that Russia is able to play by different rules and that Ukraine is not actually protected by this crime by Article 5. Tit-for-tat prevents escalation of most conflicts. Ukraine is perfectly capable of return strikes and making each attack as expensive for Russia as it is for them. But right now, Russia is protected from this basic reality of war, and that will remain the message.   

As with any war, decisions made in how it ends will set the stage for the next era. If this ends with Ukraine as some sort of buffer, not quite in NATO, not quite protected, it will lead to a very unstable position while Russia re-arms and rebuilds its psyche or nationalism. It must end with Ukraine fully in the free world, completely protected by NATO, completely in the EU, completely supported and accepted.

So it is just as important to bring these air attacks to a close as it is to regain territory this summer. The way to do that is begin making very that NATO supports Ukraine's right to strike back, and to start a very public and supportive discussion about the necessary arms to accomplish that. Stop saying things like ""we're assured F16s won't be used to strike Russian soil"" and start saying ""these will give Ukraine the ability to close this conflict"".",False,1686728389.0,t3_148xwxa,t3_148xwxa,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

The whole premise of KH-47M2 is that it flies to 50-70km and stays there at 4km/s. Then the second stage turns towards the target starting the maneuver about 50-70km out, to get to the target at very high angle - over 70 degrees. Which means Patriot radar detected it when it should still be in cruise mode. I know that second stage has it's own motor and control surfaces (very similar to R-77 and Falcon-9), but I don't know when the second stage motor engages - during the cruise phase? Or terminal phase to help fight the air resistance (that would actually slow it down even further) ? 

One more thing - I would love to find what was the altitude of Kh-47M2 at the moment of detection. If Russians are lying regarding the speed, maybe they are lying about altitude? I think yesterday I was reading they intercepted that Kinzhal at around 100km. That again - doesn't make sense as it would mean that Kh-47M2 was still at 50+km - which is outside of any Patriot envelope and it's definitely outside of the envelope of PAC-3 (range). That would make even more sense (detection at + 150km most probably 200, launch of PAC-2 accelerating to Mach 4, meeting the target in the middle as target was traveling at 3.5Ma - only altitude doesn't fit here. It would work if Kinzhal wasn't doing s steep dive, but shallow dive, which would be the stupidest thing ever to do with a warhead traveling at that speed).

Basically every level of the military hierarchy lies a little bit, and by the time those lies accumulate to the top, the reporting has little relation with reality on the ground.

A platoon is ordered to take a trench, but they get soundly repulsed with huge losses for themselves and no losses for the enemy. They cannot report this though because they would be incompetent and disciplined, so they report they at least managed to take out as many enemy soldiers in their valiant attempt. The next officer up has to report that but feels only killing as many enemy troops as he lost still looks bad and those losses were pretty severe, so he doubles the enemy losses, halves his own, and tosses on a couple tanks to make himself look better. The next officer up gets that but realizes he was ordered to advance the front line, and the balance of losses still isn't great, so he juices the numbers again and adds that they advanced 200m.

This goes on and on until you get reports at the top where Ukraine is losing 300 tanks, 50 HIMARS, 80,000 soldiers while Russia has only lost 6000 men and a handful of tanks while advancing across the front line.

What is ‘reflective survey targets’?

As to spies/saboteurs/traitors: 

I recall reading from feature stories of the legwork the TRO would learn that was done prior to invasion.  Seems like set up beacons on water towers, installed cameras, some radio transmissions devices, etc.  IIRC, one was witnessed north of Kyiv, was done by military-looking men, which was assumed at that moment by the witnesses was Ukrainian military, but later, by the TRO commander recounting it, that it was Russians masquerading as Ukrainians.  

I supposed it could actually be treacherous Ukrainians...

I believe what I’m referencing is in these two features:

I want to also mention that whenever I’ve read the features on Ukrainians (Commanders, hero’s, etc), they have already been authorized to disclose, and it’s almost always the case that they specifically mention that the Russians encountered were eventually killed, like in a later confrontation.  They don’t say that here, but it does lead me to wonder whether the Russian saboteurs’ identities were later known by command and known to have been killed.

When it’s the case that it’s treasonous Ukrainians, they almost all fled prior to Russia retreating from Kyiv.  Because it became clear that the traitors were successfully being hunted down—arrested by SBU—but if discovered by fellow countrymen, were getting killed.  Those stories don’t make it to the international press, but the domestic press almost daily prints stories of people charged as aiding the enemy, (even now! this late in the game, there’s still traitors!), but rarely up in Kyiv region these days—those cases are almost always in absentia.",1686771091.0,1686770707.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo4xn3n,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

The way I see it, there was a point on 24 February last year, when it would have been clear to every ukrainian that an invasion really was happening. 

Given that the expert opinion was russia would crush them in days and given Russia's history of  brutality to its opponents, the sensible, self interested choice for any ukrainian soldier or civil servant at that point would have been to burn their uniform and melt into the population or stuff a suitcase full of whatever they could carry and skip the country with their families.

Sure they might be ordered to stay but as we saw in afghanistan,  that means nothing if people don't believe in what they've been ordered to defend.

In that first 24-48 hours every ukrainian in a uniform and really every ukrainian citizen had to make a very private, personal decision - did they genuinely, in their heart of hearts believe the idea of a free ukraine was worth fighting for, did they trust their fellow citizens to stay and fight with them, and were they willing to stake their lives and the lives of their loved ones on that belief.

The reason Ukraine is still on the map is because on 24 February he overwhelming majority of ukrainians  chose to believe in each other and the future of their nation.  And at the end of the day all the russian propaganda and bullshit about ukraine being a made up country or a historical mistake can't change the fact that when faced with that critical choice they stayed, they fought and they're still there defending their home under their free flag.

Ukraine isn't choosing independence so much as is it is being forced into outright aligning itself with one pole rather than another. It hasn't been allowed to fence sit and the aggression of the increasingly extreme Russian state has caused it to swing in the other direction.

Also, although the Russians are unwilling to commit to total war, due to the political consequences, they are far more invested in this war than the British were. The British had to deal with a near, significant power, especially at sea, and thus committed no significant part of their naval power to the American colonies.

The only time I have heard anything of them since the Moskva sinking/Snake Island liberation was one was shot down in a friendly-fire incident over Kyiv a few months ago. So they are still using it; but again not on the front lines as I haven't heard any of them shot down on the front recently. Early in the war, they were clearly effective, today this might not be the case, this is likely because Russian air defense (AD) or Electronic Warfare (EW) tactics have changed from the beginning of the war. Ukraine is having a difficult time asserting air dominance in general close to the front lines, once Ukraine gets F-16s and can knock out AD with HARMS and Russia's Mig-31 with Aim-120/Meteors, we might see a return of Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2s on the front line. 

In the Armenia-Azerbaijan war, Azerbaijan used the drones for what felt like 2 months straight unopposed, and Armenia had an AD envelope in theatre that I would say is about 70% similar to Russia's AD network in Ukraine. Armenia had 9k/IGLA Manpads, Buk M1, Tor and of course, S300, Armenia also has SU-30s and Mig-29s that could have handled them as well. These systems are older and not Russia's latest and greatest, but in a number of Turkish-Russian proxy conflicts, the TB2s have taken out the more modern stuff for example the Pantsir system in Libya.

The problem is, these drones were designed for militaries like the United States, Israel, and Turkey; and conflicts they have been in for the past 5-15 years. They were designed to fight insurgents who don't have effective air defenses, even if their rivals have AD those three have the SEAD and AD capabilities that could handle that threat, leaving the bombing and lighter work for the drones. Ukraine at the moment cannot risk what little Air Force assets they have on trying to take out Russia's AD network. These drones fly very far up and are slow and are meant to have high endurance as they support the troops down below in low-intensity conflict, they should be relatively easy targets to take down for a competent military with an effective AD network. I imagine going forward they will be designed to be stealthier, and drones that are not stealthy will be designed to operate low to the ground, to use ground cover to hide from enemy radar, and fire standoff munitions.",1686726537.0,1686726207.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo2p95u,,1,22,0,22,0,0,

1. keep reserves ready to defend Tokmak from the north and let Ukraine push south from Velyka Novosilka then turn westward at Kamianka, bypassing the entire defensive line all the way to Tokmak

OR

2) Reinforce the troops at Velyka Novosilka and leave the the fortifications on the lline north of Tokmak undermanned.

Wherever the reserves don't go is where you'll see the Russian lines break and then you'll see the additional brigades with their western equipment route them further.

The myth of the poor and oppressed masses rising up and toppling despots is largely just that; a myth. Governments of all types in all parts of the world usually get changed by a large professional class revolt or by groups of powerful individual leaders of factions. Now, the question is; how much could Putin recruit from these ""danger classes"" before he unbalances his position too much? Obviously, we would all like to think the regime will fall on day 1 the draft is announced, but sadly most indicators point to very strong support for the war amongst the middle class and the upper class has been largely defanged in Russia.

2) It is almost impossible for a large nation like Russia to ever completely run out of weapons, but its not like you can just tell 500 000 people to report to the battlefield and the weapons fairy gives them equipment out of thin air. As a sign of how bad things are, even at the start of the war, the real, freshly arrived Russian army would stop its attacks at night, because the professional, lifelong, prepared soldiers didn't have night vision googles. You can literally buy this shit at Amazon, and the Russian professional soldiers would stop fighting the war for 50% of the time because the sun went away for the day. In the 21st century.

Way too early in the invasion, pictures where taken of firearms with rust on them, tanks built during the Stalin administration where seen on the front, and recruits where asked to bring their own sleeping bags and first aid kits.

The famous saying goes: ""Russia has a large and modern military. But the large part is not very modern and the modern part is not very large.""

Russia has been scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to quality even at day 1 of the invasion. The problem is that the bottom of the barrel is pretty wide; it might still have a pretty large deal of low quality weapons, and most of them do still kill when you point them at a face and pull the trigger. The good news is, normal militaries' change their 1950 weapons for newer stuff for very good reasons, and recruited civilians with low quality weapons are only suited for low complexity, low manoeuvre defensive works manning. And even for that, they suck, especially against NATO manoeuvre heavy tactics, and especially when they aren't defending their own hometown and families but some foreign piece of land.",1686771106.0,1686769856.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo4jqc7,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

The first line of defense, which is what the Ukrainians are breaching right now, is less of an actual fortification, and more of a delaying tripwire.   The ideal Russian response would be to use that initial contact to determine where the Ukrainians intend to attack so they can place their reserves in the correct parts of the 2nd line and set up artillery in positions to provide volume fire in response.  They'll have a 3rd line to serve as a fallback point if portions of the 2nd line fail.

With the fairly conservative assault plans the Ukrainians are using to reduce attrition of units and equipment,  we're possibly going to see the tempo of the direct assaults slow a bit in the coming weeks once the Ukrainians are occupying advantageous terrain points along the front.   The Ukrainians will continue to keep the Russians engaged with probes and skirmishes, just to keep the Russians from settling and reconstituting.  The slowdown will also give Ukraine the chance to assess and plan new lines of attack, rotate their frontline units for fresh reserves, and move their support elements (logistics, artillery, air defense units) closer to the front.   Then there's likely to be an intense round of bombardments and deep standoff missile strikes to eliminate as much artillery and logistical support as possible before attacking that second line of defenses.   Once they make breakthroughs, the fresh modernized brigades might finally be committed to the fight.

There are plenty of examples where an attack was performed recklessly and at great risk but succeeded, but there are just as many examples of those reckless attacks failing. Ukraine is definitely playing it carefully.

In this offensive, there are many factors involved in the slow evolution of the attack, but they can be boiled down to 4 points:

\* keep your forces as fresh as possible

\* keep your forces well supplied

\* keep the enemy engaged and sustain continual shaping operations

\* keep your forces safe

The first point relies on regularly rotating troops in and out of the direct action. Equipment breaks, units need replenishing, and the attack can only be sustained for so long until the soldiers cannot continue to be effective. You can push your units to fight to the edge of breaking, but that will lead to mistakes and breakdowns. (See: Russian offensives).

Second point - to keep yourself in supply, you have to be in reach of your logistical setup. If you push too far ahead, and fail to keep your lines of supply nearby, you put yourself at risk of running out of ammunition and fuel at inopportune times, leading to defeats and breakdowns. Slowing your advance allows your slower logistical chain units to keep up, since a truck delivering supplies has to travel twice as far as your offensive units push. Go too far ahead, and.... well, See: Russian offensives.

Third point - You need to ensure that you keep opposing forces engaged so that they can't settle to rest and reconstitute. You'll even perform fallbacks to see if you can draw your opposition into bad positions. You want to continue a cycle of continually attritting your opponent into trying to push back, especially when they're eagerly pushing themselves into tor guns and artillery, and putting their supplies and support units into the line of fire. When you can do this while taking the safer path of being on the defense than exposing yourself to attack, all the better.  That's opposed to continually trying to run forward endlessly, and committing to nothing but direct assaults - See: Russian Offensive

Finally, the last point. You don't want to push too deeply, too quickly, and too randomly. Do not overextend and expose yourself to heavy artillery fire and flanking maneuvers. If you find a flaw with your tactics or approach, correct them before proceeding. And keeping your troops safe means they can continue to contribute and fight successfully. You can't push, push and push; see: - well, you know where I'm going now.

Break your enemies, but don't break yourself.",1686787611.0,1686787301.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo5u0qa,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

If Russia's military can do what they should be able to do with what they have, then you will be correct.
Don't underestimate the political aspects of war. Incursions into Belgorod and sabotage all over Russia will become a real problem for Russia. Potentially losing Bakhmut, and all the infighting among different Russian forces will be a problem.

Ukraine also has a major advantage in drones and intelligence overall. 

Russia's logistics are becoming very degraded in certain parts of Ukraine. We don't yet know if Ukraine can manage the logistics to sustain a major offensive with so much different equipment.

Just like the Russians, Ukraine now has their forces distributed across a very wide front.  This opposes the NATO practice of a high volume, combined arms advance across a very narrow 2-4km stretch of the front in order to break through as fast as possible.

My interpretation of what is happening is that Ukraine is currently probing to find weak defensive positions, while also pinning reserves across the front and ideally depleting their ammunition stores and infantry/vehicles.  After this phase, when Russia is sufficiently tired and ammo hungry - I would expect a very focused attack in a specific area.

They may also be buying time to wait for air support - which is currently lacking.

One of the huge pluses for Ukraine in this were the local territorial guys that holed up for two days within the airport grounds and managed to call through on mobiles and direct the firestrikes.  This was unplanned but one of those moments that turn the tide of history. 

 It's one of those Hollywood moments -

""Uh, sir, we've got a guy that's phoned through on the main switchboard saying he's inside Hostomel"" 

Dramatic pause, look of confusion and relief crosses Zaluzhny's face....

""What? Who the hell is he? Is he legit?""

Boom,

""He says, West 50 meters,  South 20 meters sir, try that. ""

Russian Helicopter goes Boom. 

Two days of forward observed artillery correction ensues. 

As to the negating the point of taking the airport, this was meant to be the forward logistics point for the assault on Kyiv from the North, Without anywhere to land supplies in quantity the Convoy ran out of fuel and the soldiers on the ground had to turn to looting for food, fuel and water before trying to cross to Irpin. They were expecting to get to a nicely set up forward hub at the airport and instead they found their VDV colleagues hiding in the woods, with Bayraktars flying overhead taking out air defense and artillery.

You can almost paint a historical mural of Soviets expelling Nazi's followed by Z troops storming Azovstal. But it doesn't necessarily give me hope that there is a real end in sight. I don't see a practical way to offer Putin the ""golden bridge to retreat"" that he's signalling readiness to accept.

As with WW2, the decisions made in how the war ends will shape the next era. I think it is critical that this ends with Ukraine in a stable position, welcomed into the west, which is what they have fought for. If they end up as some ""buffer zone"", not really in NATO, not really protected by article 5,  tied up in the West's rules for how to defend itself while Russia lobs occasional missiles/drones over the border, it could end up in a perpetually unstable position. 

One thing that has governed the character of this conflict is guessing Putin's ""red line"", and as a strategy, he has clearly used tacit threats of nuclear escalation. In a way, Bush, Obama, and Trump trained him to do this as they shied away from addressing aggression. At the start of this conflict, NATO troops/advisors were rushed out... and I've always wondered if the conflict would even have taken place if that hadn't happened. Then, would it be satellite support? HIMARS? Mig29s? Sinking the Moscow? Destroying the Kerch bridge? Abrams/Leopards? F16s? Attacks over the border?

Each time NATO second guesses, it forgets this is about his ego. As Russia loses town after town this summer, I do believe we still start to see real impulsive desperation sink in. Take the dam disaster as an example of what is to come. Putin doesn't give a crap what happens to his troops, their families or the economy. He may well attempt tactical nuclear strikes, or raise the threat again because it is getting to the point that it is his only card left.

bbef3ef31c11db0067b14978965297d4,148xwxa,jo4hadb,"This explanation could go for a bit. 

Logistically speaking, supplies and ammunition would have to be spread across all those units. With the challenges in 'last mile' supply delivery due to attritional and maintenance-induced shortages of vehicles capable of delivering needed material quickly to the front, as well as relying on the large railroad junctions from Russian territory, the Russians are now in a bit of a quandary. 

The Russians are forced to distribute their supplies across the entire front, but also had to centralize those supplies enough to allow their limited transportation pool to reach units in a timely manner. They've had to bring those logistical points closer to the front to ensure they can reach everywhere - which means they're in the line of fire from HIMARS strikes on a regular basis. They can't spread out the supplies since that means you have to have more vehicles to ferry those supplies out. The Russians were using the ports in captured territory to relieve the pressure on the rail networks, but now that Berdyansk is being frequently visited by Storm Shadow strikes, that approach is an issue. There's additional challenges when you have supplies in locations A, B and C, when you really needed to have those supplies in D and E. You'll have to find a way to shift supplies, using that same limited transport pool and overburdened rail network. 

Artillery (which is by far the most potent Russian weapon so far) faces a similar issue with spacing and coverage. Russian army doctrine is based on fire-by-volume, rather than precision fire as NATO prefers. To cover a wider front, they have to centralize their artillery at high points of terrain to (a) cover as much as possible, and (b) stay near points of supply to ensure they can maintain an adequate rate of fire. That centralization comes at greater risk, as they're easier to spot and hit, especially with reconnaissance by drones being widespread. Hitting enough of those central points will compromise the defensive tactics for whole parts of the line, which can then be exploited.

So, to the point you were making - NATO doctrine would predicate their attack on concentrated force along a narrow front, as you noted. However, the doctrine relies heavily on having air and land dominance, and relies on the heavy application of aerial strikes and interdiction to cause ruptures in depth amongst the defensive lines to allow the concentrated land force to overrun the opposition.  The Ukrainians don't have that aerial strike capability, so it would be costly to apply the narrow front assault, as the Russians have so aptly demonstrated.  The Ukrainians do have numbers of troops on their side, however, so the approach Ukraine is taking works for the situation they find themselves in - especially with keeping attrition low as possible. 

TL;DR - I see that stretch of Ukrainian front lines as an intentional effort to force the Russians to stretch their defensive units more thinly, but more importantly, concentrate their logistical and artillery units in a way to cover that wider frontage with greater risks.   The NATO doctrine relies on air-land dominance the Ukrainians don't have right now, so this is a decent lower risk compromise.",False,1686762651.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo48glu,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

MIRVs aren't ""smallish"" warheads. Each one is huge, and we launch a ton of them at the same time to really make sure that city we're aiming at is dead.

An MIRV is a cluster of giant nukes, **AND** a lot of them (8 to 15 at a time). Its both huge AND multiple.",False,1686755464.0,t3_148xwxa,t1_jo3zht2,,7,-1,0,-1,0,0,
