The longer this goes on, the less effective this tactic is. I think Russia will be subject to Guerilla warfare in key locations. This should hopefully slow down the assault, as it is hard to advance when you are getting shot at from random directions. 

I don't think they want to obliterate Kyiv entirely, as the idea is to install a puppet government and own the area. Every piece of infrastructure destroyed is a price he has to calculate paying down the line when the piper asks to be paid. This means that just blowing up Kyiv to get rid of guerilla defenders is mostly off the table to at least some degree.

My guess? Putin either overplayed his hand, vastly overestimating both his own forces, his own tactics, while underestimating the worldwide response, or he's still got aces up his sleeve. I'm more inclined towards the latter unless the rumours surrounding his health are as true as they say.

I've linked to their English language Youtube channel, with voiceover translation... [here is their Ukranian channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/kreosan/featured), with 4.6 million subscribers!

So.... thirdly.... I pray for my brothers and sisters in Ukraine. They are the coolest people and also the mother fucking hardest!

I like to think that the potentially millions in the KREOSAN collective are coming up with deadly plans to fuck up the Russians. They know the tunnels under Kyiv better than authorities. They know how to make explosives. 

And they are as hard as fuck!

Long Live Ukraine!

> If Russia's banks were banned from SWIFT, they would find it much harder to access financial markets around the world.

> As a result, it would be much harder - although not impossible - for Russian businesses and individuals with bank accounts in the country to import and export goods, and borrow and invest abroad.

> Some 300 Russian banks and financial institutions use SWIFT for interbank transfers.

> A ban on Russian financial institutions would not be a world first. Some Iranian banks were barred from SWIFT in 2019 following US sanctions. The country as a whole had its access suspended between 2012 and 2016.

# Why not block it?

> While blocking Russian access to the system would impact the country's economy, it would also have knock-on effects in Europe - leading some European leaders to withhold their support for such a measure.

> German finance minister Christian Lindner told broadcaster ARD that blocking Russia's SWIFT access would bring with it ""a high risk that Germany would no longer receive gas and other raw materials"" from Russia, a concern reportedly shared by fellow EU states Italy, Hungary, Cyprus and Latvia. 

## NOTE: Both [Germany](https://twitter.com/Conflicts/status/1497242479371952129?t=R0yhpoZmQS4bmUK1tWKYQQ&s=19) and [Italy](https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1497267568461205509?t=20ucIqw8Hdy3Z3tfLjfbyA&s=19) support a SWIFT ban.

> In the United States, there are also concerns over the potential destabilising effects of such a move.

> Brian Frey, a former US Justice Department prosecutor during the Trump administration, told the Associated Press that while SWIFT is the primary messaging system for financial payments, ""there are alternatives to the system"" and cutting Russia off would create a ""splashback and immediate problems for the international community"".

It is best known for graphics processing units, which power video games and advanced computer simulations. However, the chips are also central to artificial intelligence programs and robotics, making them of growing national security importance.  
Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey, said systems may have been deliberately shut down if the company had been hit by a cyber attack that risked spreading further, such as by embedding viruses in computer software distributed to consumers and businesses, or infiltrating other parts of the company to steal intellectual property.  
  
“The ultimate concern is that somebody may have put something in one of the software updates,” Dr Woodward said, pointing to the devastating SolarWinds hack that exploited American software companies to gain access to US government computer systems.

- Giuliani just gave an interview, somehow blaming Biden with major mental gymnastics. 

- Trump has only praised Putin's ""genius.""

- When Trump was President, he was floating withdrawing from NATO.

- Recall Trump's strange relationship with Putin, his interest in establishing hotels in Moscow, and outright requesting Russia to hack domestic opposition's data.

Donate, and please plan to **REGISTER and VOTE** for the CRUCIAL midterms in the US this year. 

Not voting or voting for Republicans or some 3rs party is effectively supporting and advancing Putin's goals. (I want new parties too but our system penalizes 3rd parties) 

------------

When I previously posted this, I received some very strange pro-Russian/Trump replies, trying to deflect attention to the fact that Trump seriously weighed attempting to withdraw from NATO...

Why does this matter? Because this is an event that won't end any time soon. I'm giving **concrete steps of what the average American can do for Ukrainian citizens in the long-run**, which is to ensure the strongest opposition to Russia remains out of the hands of...Russia. It's time to ensure that Pro-Russian, potentially-compromised individuals never get into the White House again.

>On Feb. 23 Russia launched a war on Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and its parliament (Rada) might accelerate steps to ensure the continuity of government, a need made more urgent because of the risk that Kyiv could soon fall.

>Zelensky may still under-estimate dangers. Despite reports that government relocation plans have been discussed with the U.S., a Zelensky associate reportedly said the president would “not run away from his own capital."" Yet, forces in Russia and Belarus are poised to lunge southward on both sides of the Dnipro River and encircle Kyiv within days. 

>Ukraine’s armed forces report of shelling of various cities and towns across the country, including Boryspil airport, close to the capital. Other attempts to destabilize Ukraine were underway earlier, such as pro-Russian “protests” in Kyiv and almost non-stop cyberattacks on Ukrainian government institutions and banks. 

>Zelensky’s reluctance for weeks to warn Ukrainians of the severity of the threat may leave more citizens, especially in large cities, vulnerable to being trapped behind an invading force. The delay may also help Russian forces seize intact more of the country’s governmental capacity. 

>If Zelensky were to stay behind in Kyiv and be captured, this could deal a psychological blow to the morale of Ukrainians and diminish their will to resist. Even more important is the survival of the presidency and the legislative and judicial branches. This may require a prompt, large-scale relocation to western Ukraine, and support from Poland. Reconstitution of any lost leadership capacity could require Rada approval to enhance legitimacy.

>A government collapse could impede organization and operation of an insurgency based in the mountains of western Ukraine, and the will of others to support it.

>Pursuit of a quick government collapse may explain Russia’s apparent strategy of early “shock and awe” attacks on Kyiv and other cities, and its reported plan to assassinate and arrest key Ukrainian figures. If Zelensky were captured, Russian authorities might not kill him as they did Prime Minister Imre Nagy after Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary in 1956, but the Kremlin could pressure and embarrass him.

>To reduce these risks, Ukraine’s leadership might accelerate preparations to ensure the continuity of government. Some steps are doubtless underway but out of public view.

If Russia turns off the tap then energy prices rise when it’s still winter. (when they’ve already risen so much) This will hurt the poorest of Germans as they will need to spend a larger percent of their income on just staying warm.

I wish it were different, but at the end of the day Olaf Scholz was elected by the people of Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg not Kiev, Odessa, or Kharkiv.

So why entice and risk bigger confrontation by openly accepting Finland and Sweden now? It’s a status, and reality is they are both already team NATO If shit hits the fan. Same with Switzerland who, although famously neutral, would be on the NATO side of things.

Not watching the TV so all of the propaganda I see comes from online troll farms.

I feel sick typing this bullshit.

Oh, also, that Zelensky threatened to get nuclear weapons and that we can't have a madman with nukes on our border threatening our peaceful small country.

I saw one big Russian singer posting on Instagram how the 'special operation' (you can't say war or invasion in the news by the way, it's a ""special operation"") in Ukraine is legal because there is some UN article where you can protect yourself and your allies and Russia is protecting LPR and DPR so we are in the right.

President P also just called on the Ukrainian army to think and stop assisting ""neonazis and junkies in Kyiv, who are hiding behind innocent people"", that there is no sense talking to them so army should act directly. I think he went crazy.

>Russian banks and their foreign partners would use other means of communication. And transactions would migrate en masse to SPFS, a Russian alternative to SWIFT that is not nearly as ubiquitous and sophisticated, but still usable. That would cause some disruption—but not disaster. Over time, investment in SPFS would make the system speedier.  
Meanwhile the West would bear costs. Russia is far bigger than other economies America has embargoed. Disruption would spill over to the countries that have business dealings with it. Russia is the EU’s fifth-largest trading partner, for instance. There could also be indirect damage through retaliation. Russia is the source of 35% of Europe’s gas supply and is home to €310bn ($350bn) of EU assets.  
And cutting off Russian banks could hurt American interests. America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems.

If he is not stopped sooner, rather than later, there may come a point where he feels he has no *choice* but to advance into NATO, to remain threatening/because of his insane pettiness and ego, and at that point it may well be too late to avert WW3.

Again, everyone keeps referring to MAD and how ""Putin wouldn't want NATO to launch nukes"", but also keep forgetting that this principle only applies if the person in charge is not dangerously irrational, which increasingly seems to be the case with Putin, especially given a large portion of his entourage's stunned reactions.

Russia´ s plan appearently was to capture Kyiv on day one and then change the Government. For this they used Special Forces in an airborn assault. Well, that really didnt pan out. The Airborn managed to capture the Airport but was quickly destroyed by the defenders. 

Russia launched ground offensives along more or less the entire frontline and managed to break through in some areas. But every single offensive so far has been halted duo to intense resistance. 

Just to give you a feel for the Numbers. According to the Ukraine Minsitry of Defense, some  80 Tanks, 10 Jet´s, 7 Helicopters have been destroyed, 2800 Personal on the Russian side are either dead or captured and up to 516 Armored vehciles of all kinds are unable to fight / destroyed.   
These are most likley exadurations but even if you make them more realistic, Russia just lost with a Ratio of about 5:1.

According to the Pentagon, most Russian advances have been stopped and the only real attempt at progress is towards Kyiv.  But even there it seems like they are hitting a brick wall.

By all accounts, the Russian army has failed there initial objectives. They didnt capture Kyiv nor any other major city and got bogged down basically everywhere expect in the south near Crimea.",False,1645815564.0,t3_t1abdi,t1_hyewmez,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Generally youll have a nuclear isotope like uranium or plutonium, in a specific spot in the missile. Once the missile closes in on its target, the isotope moves down a passage in the missile, until it hits the combustion device, triggering the effect and then explosion. If hypothetically, you intercepted the missile before this event happens(blow it up mid air) it likely will not be released from its device. 

So short answer, no explosion. Worse answer; that isotope needs to land somewhere and its HIGHLY radioactive.

Anti-ICBM systems are quite frankly highly classified. There were a ton of tensions over US development and deployment of Anti-ICBM missiles, and Russia has maintained a position that it would engage in a first strike if it felt like NATO was coming close to a defense system that could realistically neutralize its arsenal.

Public development of Anti-ICBM systems has stopped / drastically slowed in recent decades as a part of appeasement of Russia and China. There may have been secret projects that we are not aware of though. 

Theoretically, the best time to intercept ICBMs is as close to their launch as possible. That is when they are traveling the slowest, the least maneuverable, putting off the highest heat signature, and are not at a point where the stages of the booster could or are separated. 

There is no known system that could intercept an ICBM once it is in orbit, or during its re-entry phase. 

If an ICBM were to be intercepted, it would effectively distribute its nuclear material as if it were a dirty conventional bomb detonated at altitude. Fall out could pretty significant, and on par with disasters like Chernobyl.

1. In WWII, Ukrainian volunteers formed their own small branch of the Schutzstaffel (SS) of Nazi Germany, with enough men to provide a full division of fighting troops. While technically, factually correct, this also ignores the fact that the Nazis recruited from every corner of their occupied territory that they could, even managing to form a collaborationist ""Russian Liberation Army"" under the command of a defecting Soviet General. 

2. The War in Donbass as it progressed in 2014 saw the involvement of irregular Ukrainian militia forces, some of which were unashamedly far-right in nature. Examples of this include the rather infamous Azov Battalion, which was heavily involved in fighting in Eastern Ukraine. Predictably, these forces have since then largely been sidelined for training and equipment support due to their obviously white supremacist nature.

America’s biggest microchip company is investigating a potential cyber attack that has taken parts of its business offline for two days, The Telegraph can reveal.  
Nvidia’s email systems and developer tools are understood to have been suffering from outages over the last two days, after what is believed to have been a malicious network intrusion.  
The suspected hack comes amid Russian cyberwarfare against Ukraine and heightened security concerns about attacks on the West in retaliation for hitting the Kremlin with sanctions. There is no evidence linking Nvidia's outages to the conflict.  
An Nvidia spokesman said: “We are investigating an incident. We don’t have any additional information to share at this time.""

It is unclear if any data has been stolen or deleted from Nvidia or from its customers, or if the attack has merely disrupted its systems, and customers said they had not been informed of any incident.  
The company is not yet believed to have identified a culprit.   
Nvidia, based in Silicon Valley, is worth over $600bn, putting it among the world’s most valuable corporations.

It is best known for graphics processing units, which power video games and advanced computer simulations. However, the chips are also central to artificial intelligence programs and robotics, making them of growing national security importance.

Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey, said systems may have been deliberately shut down if the company had been hit by a cyber attack that risked spreading further, such as by embedding viruses in computer software distributed to consumers and businesses, or infiltrating other parts of the company to steal intellectual property.  
  
“The ultimate concern is that somebody may have put something in one of the software updates,” Dr Woodward said, pointing to the devastating SolarWinds hack that exploited American software companies to gain access to US government computer systems.

Historically every country was self contained, so all the money circulated within that country. If anyone even had money, ie, they may have been serfs or something working land. 

In modern economies, every country deals with other countries in some way for trade, technology, etc. Some countries have different natural resources. Some countries have more tech. Some countries facilitate money transfers.

For a modern economy, being cut off is devastating. For any country. The issue is finding ways to cut them off that hurts them more than it hurts your own country. 

That's why there are immediate sanctions against Russian oligarchs and certain businesses, but not others like oil, because drawing a fine line between those industries allows you to maximize the damage for the economic losses you sustain. 

If it becomes more vital, for example to prevent further expansion or imperialism by Russia, then you would weigh the cost to your economy over a protracted land war. Which is very costly, in lives, political capital, and wealth. So you may, at that time, be more inclined to take a bigger hit to deal more damage to the enemy economy.

What would happen is that Ukraine would lose its leader, and how things go from there depends on many factors. The leadership role could be fulfilled by someone else, split, or it could dissolve. If it dissolves, either the people keep fighting, with pockets of resistance across the country, or the resistance collapses. I believe they would keep fighting, but I'm just a guy on the internet.

If Russia beats all resistance and establishes a puppet government, there's the question of legitimacy. The invading army with the new government need to control the population and suppress resistance. I believe to do this, in the case of Ukraine, they would need to be horribly oppressive, and will constantly have to silence revolts. This would be very ugly.

The other part of legitimacy will be international recognition. I think most countries wouldn't recognize the new government, and instead recognize some kind of government in Exile, someone who represents the current country of Ukraine.

The logistics of invading the USA are horrendous. The USA holds 11 supercarriers (US Navy's big-guns) and 17 Amphibious Assault Vessels (US Marine's big-guns).

Any attempt to invade the USA would require supply lines extending from the country in question (Russia/China) to the USA. This means attacking, and holding, islands along the way. (Ex: Hawaii would be incredibly important).

The 11-supercarriers are **each** equipped with the firepower equivalent to most other country's entire airforce. With 2-runways each and 4-catapults, each supercarrier can shoot off 4 airplanes in the same time as a ""typical"" carrier can launch one aircraft. So each supercarrier in effect functions as 4-regular carriers.

The 17-Amphibious Assault crafts would be considered a carrier in any other Navy, with F35B aircraft, helicopters, and an entire batallion of Marines hiding below decks. Unlike the Supercarrier however, Amphibious Assault Vessels are designed for sea-vs-ground combat.

----------

So to attack the USA, you need:

1. To defeat all 11 Super-carriers somehow to obtain safe-passage across the pacific (each of which holds the power of a typical air-force)

2. Attack Hawaii (among many other islands: midway, and such) to establish supply lines across the Pacific.

3. Defend from those 17 Amphibious Assault Vessels the entire time. Each of which holds the power of a small-air force and like 1500 marines ready to assault any beach.

--------

Once that feat is accomplished, congratulations, you may start **thinking** about attacking California. Even with the US Navy defeated, California alone holds enough of an air-force / missiles to prevent any reasonable attack vector by sea.

The idea of attacking California through Hawaii-based supplies is already a stretch. Hawaii is a great base for Pacific operations, but its still many hours away from California by airplane, and like a day-away by boat.

----------

The Atlantic path has the entire like... UK / France / NATO thing going on. That's probably a stupider way to invade. The ""best"" way to invade the USA is likely through the Pacific (Alaska -> Midway -> Hawaii -> California).

The Atlantic Path is like... Germany -> France -> UK -> Iceland -> Canada -> Maine, a much harder path to reach the USA.",1645814010.0,1645813588.0,t3_t1abdi,t1_hyeso31,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

The only way there'd be such a conflict is if Russia attacked a NATO member (or friend, see below). Russia could end any such  conflict simply by withdrawing. They'd never have to use nukes. Russia could never win such a conflict.

>So why entice and risk bigger confrontation by openly accepting Finland and Sweden now?

The question is: does not being a member of NATO invite invasion? Georgia and Ukraine would suggest it might. I have no doubt that Putin would not be invading Ukraine if Ukraine was a member of NATO. I'm not convinced, but there's definitely a very strong argument that Finland and Sweden joining NATO would deter Putin from invading them (and thus sparking a wider conflict). So, not joining NATO might be enticing and risking a bigger confrontation.

>I don’t think people fully grasp this and the gravity of this needs to be appreciated to understand why nato and the us don’t want to directly fight Russia.

Indeed but that's also why Putin doesn't want to directly fight NATO (Russia would be utterly destroyed in a nuclear war). And remember, that will only happen if

1) Putin attacks NATO   
or possibly if  
2) he attacks non-NATO countries like Finland or Sweden so egregiously that NATO countries - not NATO itself - ally with those countries and become at war with Russia.

Basically, and ICBM launched at Ukraine resembles an ICBM launched at Poland or Italy or Germany or Britain until it actually engages, and would have to be reacted to as such by all those nations-and in addition to UK and France having their own arsenal, any attack on them is an attack on NATO, and the result of that is that the USA launches too. And then, given that the ICBMs launched would, from the Chinese perspective, appear to be launching at *them*, *they* would need to launch too. And then India launches if they actually have capability, so Pakistan launches if *they* have capability, and in the end everyone launches because it's impossible to be *sure* if those nukes are heading for *you* or not, and you don't take risks with that shit-if there is a question, you launch.

So the entire world dies, basically, except a few countries on the fringes that merely have to deal with a demolished global economy and nuclear winter collapsing an already fragile ecology. The largest remaining economies that *might* exist are Brazil, Nigeria, Mexico, and Indonesia, but every NATO country, as well as China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and most developed NATO or American allies (like Australia and Japan) are completely gone.

It may be possible that Russia has warheads mounted on smaller cruise missiles that would not resemble first strike assets, but in that case the nuclear strike itself may still resemble the opening salvo in a nuclear war simply because its a nuclear strike. Because of proximity the UK and France would have immediately start readying their missiles to have a chance of launching if it were, which itself carries a high risk of escalation.

Because the risk of Armageddon from such a strike would be high but not a guarantee, Putin might consider using these capabilities if his interests are severely threatened-I.E. if Ukraine somehow annihilates the entire Russian army and begins a counter-invasion, or something equally implausible.

So to summarize-there is a virtually zero chance of a ICBM launch, and a  non-zero but low chance of Russia using a non ICBM platform with nuclear warheads.

There is a similarly low chance of most other WMDs, but it's not zero. It's never zero. The doomsday clock is ticking down.",False,1645813831.0,t3_t1abdi,t1_hyeqs78,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

If Democrats are so easy, then why did Russia give money to Republicans? Why did Russia wage a misinformation campaign smearing solely Democrats? Why Did they attempt to hack American elections and promote wedge-driving candidates to fragment Democrats?

Certainly, Putin would've preferred Trump being in office. But you keep pretending that ""bUt tHeY diD soMeThInG WhIlE a dEm wAs In!"" means anything, substantively.

It was more like:

- Trump lost and he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet would withdraw from NATO. 
- Covid happened, which delayed the plan.
- Putin opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- Meanwhile, Republicans cannot get their heads out of their asses and are taking advantage of the domestic chaos from nut-jobs like those who supported January 6th.",1645813870.0,1645813434.0,t3_t1abdi,t1_hyetcer,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

e0288519140ca3cda1ba89d5fcafae17,t1abdi,hyex87m,"No. No we won't. Russia won't stand a chance. The US military is far superior in experience, equipment, and economic capabilities. Ukraine only really took their army seriously in the past 8-9 years. They are ranked 22nd in the world in military strength. A country with roughly 30% the military capacity has inflicted surprising losses to the Russians. That's even after seeing the Russians build up forces. 

The US would never let Russia build up forces on it's borders. Not to mention Russia would need to use their Navy to do so. The US would not let this build up occur off it's shores. Even so, Russia's navy is notoriously a joke. 

Russia is not involved in a wide reaching treaty with allied nations that agree to go to war if one is attacked. So let's break down that situation:

Russian Military:

*  Budget: $84.5 billion USD
*  Active Personnel: 766,055
*  Tanks: 15,398
*  Aircraft: 3,429
*  5th Generation Jet Fighters: 15 Su-75
*  Submarines: 55
*  Aircraft Carrier: 1

US Military:

*  Budget: $601 billion USD
*  Active Personnel: 1,400,000
*  Tanks: 8,848
*  Aircraft: 13,892
*  5th Generation Jet Fighters: 365 F-35 and estimated ~100 F-22
*  Submarines: 72
*  Aircraft Carrier: 47 (11 of which are Fleet Carriers the largest in the world)

So right off the bat comparing the budgets and equipment of the 2 countries. It's pretty fundamentally obvious. 

Now let's not forget! The US is part of the world's strongest military alliance this world has ever seen. No need to do a detailed breakdown like above. Here are the NATO members, their military strength ranking in the world


27 - Greece: $5.5 billion
24 - Poland: $9.4 billion
23 - Canada: $15.7 billion
19 - Spain: $11.75 billion
16 - Germany: $40.2 billion
13 - Turkey: $18.2 billion
11 - Italy: $34 billion
8 - UK: $60.5 billion
7 - France: $62.3 billion

Just using these figures. The total all NATO countries have spent on their military, not including the US, far exceeds the entire GDP of Russia. 

So like..never gonna happen.
