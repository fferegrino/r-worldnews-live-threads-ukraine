SATURDAY, APRIL 16, 2022, 5 P.M.
16 Lithuanian parliamentarians have registered an amendment proposing to make May 9 in Lithuania not only Europe Day but also Genocide Remembrance Day in Ukraine.

Source : Delfi

Details : The deputies who registered the amendment belong to both the ruling parties and the opposition. Among the authors of the project are the Speaker of the Seimas Victoria Chmilite-Nielsen, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Justice, the main initiator and organizer - the Deputy Speaker of the Seimas Paulus Saudargas.

According to the explanatory note, ""today the world is experiencing genocide in Ukraine, committed by Putin's Russia, which is the reincarnation of the Soviet Union. Thus, this day would unite the tragedies experienced by Ukrainians then and now, ie the Holodomor and extermination, and the war crimes committed by the Russian military today. ""


A similar decision was made by the Latvian Parliament, which declared May 9 a day of remembrance for the victims of the war in Ukraine. Mass events are banned in Latvia on this day.""

Experts analyzed a number of satellites with an infrared filter, and saw that the explosion on the ship occurred at 6:52 (Kyiv time) on April 13.

At that time, the ship was east of Snake Island - 80 nautical miles from Odessa and 50 nautical miles from the Ukrainian coast. Exact coordinates at the time of impact of Ukrainian missiles on the Russian cruiser 45°10'43.39″N, 30°55'30.54″E

Experts note that several other Russian warships were stationed near Moscow at the time.

The location of the ship is consistent with satellite images of the ship on April 12.

> It’s not that the various presidents and prime ministers who profess sympathy for the Ukrainian cause don’t want to help, Zelensky said: “They are not against us. They just live in a different situation. As long as they have not lost their parents and children, they do not feel the way we feel.” He makes the comparison to the conversations he has with the extraordinary defenders of Mariupol, the besieged port city where 21,000 civilians may have been killed so far. “For example, they say, ‘We need help; we have four hours.’ And even in Kyiv we don’t understand what four hours are. In Washington for sure they can’t understand. However, we are grateful to the U.S., because the planes with weapons are still coming.”

...

He wants to present an image of Ukraine as a modern and liberal state, one unified by a civic, as opposed to a purely ethnic, nationalism. “The U.S., Britain, the EU, and European countries have always been skeptical of our development, of our ‘Europeanness,’” he said.

Yes, they claim to have captured, destroyed, or damaged more than 600 tanks. Yes, they say they’ve sunk the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Yes, they changed the image of their country, and their understanding of themselves. But the price has been colossal.

> Too many Ukrainians, Zelensky told us, died not in battle, but “in the act of torture.” Children got frostbite hiding in cellars; women were raped; elderly people died of starvation; pedestrians were shot down in the street. “How will these people be able to enjoy the victory?” he asked. “They will not be able to do to the Russian soldiers what [the Russians] did to their children or daughters … so they do not feel this victory.” Real victory, he said, will come only when the perpetrators are tried, convicted, and sentenced.",False,1650093797.0,t3_u4l2g2,t3_u4l2g2,,0,121,0,121,0,0,

How Stalin starved Ukraine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lejDbulJN54

In Ukraine, it’s become known as “the Holodomor,” meaning “death by starvation.” It was a genocide carried out by a dictator who wanted to keep Ukraine under his control and who would do anything to keep it covered up for decades. 

In the 1930s, Soviet leaders under Joseph Stalin engineered a famine that killed millions as they sought to consolidate agricultural power. In Ukraine, they used additional force as they sought to clamp down on a burgeoning Ukrainian national identity. There, at least 4 million died. As hunger spread among residents, Stalin spearheaded a disinformation campaign to hide the truth from other Soviet citizens and the world. So many Ukrainians died that officials had to send people to resettle the area, setting off demographic shifts that last to this day.

edit: one of the commenters in the YT video points out that the reason there are so many russian speakers in eastern ukraine is because they were resettled there after so many previous people were wiped out by the famine.",1650069789.0,1650068462.0,t3_u4l2g2,t3_u4l2g2,,0,146,0,146,0,0,

After establishing the facts of incompatibility, two battalion commanders were arrested in an unknown direction by civilians (probably FSB officers). The future of the former commanders is unknown.

Azovstal is a huge building, a huge Soviet-built plant, its area can be compared with another city, with another Mariupol, with its own communications, with roads and dungeons. That is, the facility itself was built back in Soviet times, taking into account the possibilities, including bombing, blockades, and even some structures are designed for a nuclear strike,"" he said.

Gagin added that ""the assault on this object is seriously hampered by the presence of underground communications that connect it with other similar objects in Mariupol - there is practically another city under the city.""

Mertz criticized Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his behavior in the war between Russia and Ukraine. According to the leader of the Christian Democrats, Scholz's current behavior threatens ""the unity of the entire community of states in relation to Russia.""

It will be recalled that the day before, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba called on the Federal Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz to quickly make a decision on further assistance with weapons to Ukraine. 

The Foreign Minister called for providing Ukraine with heavy weapons, including tanks. He noted that the arguments about the reluctance to provide the weapons requested by Ukraine are not an explanation, and that if Germany had dared to change its position earlier, a major war might have been avoided. 

As reported, Olaf Scholz for a long time could not finally decide on his position on the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine. However, the government coalition supports the idea of ​​such assistance.""

""During the past day, the situation in the south of Ukraine has been characterized by increasing hostile aggression,"" Ukraine's Operational Command South said in a video statement.

Russian forces were ""enraged by the losses in the Black Sea"" -- an apparent reference to the sinking of the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva -- and had ""intensified the missile threat"" in the region, the statement continued.

Sometimes history is closer than it seems. Russian soldiers who have been wounded, captured or lost friends and colleagues in Ukraine have learned that very painful lesson over the last six weeks.

The losses that the Russian Army has suffered have been extreme, not just by the standards of post-Cold War warfare, but by all 19th and 20th century standards.

Indeed the Russian war experience so far is perhaps more reminiscent of the mud and gore of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 than any subsequent military engagement.

By my calculation, based on a variety of public information, the Russians have lost approximately 30% of the forces that they have sent into Ukraine.

Tl;Dr [Labeling “the majority of” Ukrainians as Nazis, the article “What Russia should do with Ukraine” calls for the elimination of the Ukrainian elites and the “de-ukrainization” of the Ukrainian nation – even stripping Ukraine of its name, and destroying Ukrainian culture. Ukrainians are described in terms similar to the Nazi Untermenshen –  subhuman, as the Nazis referred to non-Aryan ""inferior people"" such as ""the masses from the East"" – that is Jews, Roma, and Slavs.  

By publishing this story on April 3, the same day the world found out about horrible massacre of at least 400 Ukrainian civilians by the Russian army in Bucha, RIA Novosti has sunk to a level a cynicism not seen since the 1930s in Europe. This fascist manifesto lays bare the dreadful danger that the regime of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin now poses to Ukraine, and to the world.] 

Long post 

Source: https://english.nv.ua/nation/kremlin-s-mouthpiece-ria-publishes-russian-fascist-manifesto-50231047.html 

>Back in April of last year, we wrote about the inevitability of Ukraine’s de-nazification. We don’t need the Nazi, Banderite Ukraine, an enemy of Russia and an instrument of the West to destroy Russia. Today, the question of de-nazification has come into the practical world. 

>De-nazification is necessary when a sizable part of the population - most likely, the majority - has mastered and drawn in the Nazi regime into its politics. (Fact check: Far-right parties typically fail to draw more than 3% of the vote in Ukraine, and in the 2019 parliament elections no far-right party won any seats.) 

>That is, when the theory “the people are good, the government is bad” no longer holds true. Admitting this fact is the basis of the de-nazification policy, all of its associated measures, and the fact itself is the subject matter of the policy. 

>Ukraine finds itself in exactly this situation. The fact that the Ukrainian electorate chose “Poroshenko’s peace” and “Zelensky’s peace”, should not mislead - Ukrainians are quite satisfied with the shortest path to peace through blitzkrieg, which the last two Ukrainian presidents transparently hinted at when they were elected. It was this method of ""appeasement"" of internal anti-fascists - through total terror - that was used in Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Mariupol, and other Russian cities.


>And this completely satisfied the Ukrainian layman. De-nazification is a system of measures, related to the nazification of a mass portion of the population, which cannot technically be subject to direct punishment as war criminals. 

>Nazis who take up arms have to be maximally eradicated from the battlefield. There’s no need to derive a difference between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the so-called national battalions, as well as the territorial defense forces, that has joined these two types of military formations. They’re anyway all involved in extreme cruelty against the civilian population, all equally responsible for the genocide of the Russian population, and who do not follow the laws and customs of war (Fact check: There is no evidence for the preceding claims). 

>War criminals and active Nazis have to made an example of. There has to be a total lustration - the liquidation and ban of any organizations that ties themselves to the practice of Nazism. However, aside from the leadership, a good part of the population is also responsible here, who are themselves passive Nazis, accomplices to Nazism. 

>They supported the Nazi government, and indulged it. (Fact check: It is false to describe Ukraine’s democratically elected government as “Nazi.”) 

>A just punishment for this part of the population can only be found in the burden of the hardships of a just war against the Nazi system, 

>The just punishment of this part of the population is possible only as bearing the inevitable hardships of a just war against the Nazi system, carried out with the utmost care and discretion, with respect to civilians. 

>The further de-nazification of this part of the population is composed of re-education, which should reach ideological repression (suppression) of Nazi attitudes and strict censorship: not only in the political sphere, but absolutely as well in the spheres of culture and education. It’s precisely through culture and education that the plan to deeply Nazify a mass of the population was prepared and carried out, strengthened by the promise of spoils from the victory of the Nazi regime over Russia, Nazi propaganda, internal violence and terrorism, as well as the eight year war of Ukrainian nazis against the insurgent people of the Donbass. 

>Denazification can only be conducted by the victor, which assumes 1) its unconditional control over the de-nazification process, and 2) an authority that can facilitate this control. In this respect, a country undergoing de-nazification cannot be sovereign. The de-nazification-leading government - Russia - cannot proceed from a liberal approach regarding denazification. 

>The ideology of the de-nazifying party cannot be disputed by the guilty party, subjected to de-nazification. Russia’s call for the necessity of de-nazification means that the Crimean scenario cannot work for Ukraine as whole. In fact, this scenario was already unrealistic in 2014, and in the rebellious Donbas 

>Only eight years of resistance to Nazi violence and terrorism has led to internal cohesion, and the conscious, unambiguous mass refusal to maintain any unity and connection with Ukraine, which defined itself as a Nazi society. 

>The duration of this de-nazification cannot take less than a single generation, which has to be born, grow up, and mature in the conditions of de-nazification. The Nazification of Ukraine took more than 30 years - starting at a minimum in 1989, when Ukrainian nationalism receive a legal and legitimate form of political self-expression and spearheaded the movement for “independence”, leaning towards Nazism. 

>A particular feature of Nazified Ukraine is its amorphousness and ambivalentness, which allows for the masking of Nazism as a desire to move towards an “independent” and “European” (Western and pro-American) path of development, (in reality - towards degradation), while insisting that Ukraine “doesn’t have any Nazism, only private and singular excesses.” 

>There isn’t, after all, a single important Nazi party, no fuhrer, no fully racist laws (only their curtailed variants in the form of repressions against the Russian language). As a result, there is no opposition and resistance to the regime. 

>However, all of the above does not make Ukrainian Nazism a “lite version” of German Nazism circa the first half of the 20th century. On the contrary - seeing as Ukrainian Nazism is freed from similar

 >“typical” (political-technological by nature) boundaries and restrictions, it can freely unfold as a fundamental basis for all types of Nazisms - as European, and, in a rather development form, as American racism. That’s why de-nazification cannot be conduct in a compromised fashion, on the basis of formulas like “NATO - no, the EU - yes.”

> **In your book you write that sooner or later the American model will come to a bad end. Could this be a trigger for the global economy?**

> It's already. The same European Union will have enough money, relatively speaking, until November. Now we are talking about fascism in Ukraine, because it arose there for a reason. Ukraine is the very model that awaits the European Union, and then the United States, when a large number of people with the psychology of the middle class turn out to be poor, and they will have to be controlled. The governance models that have existed so far, Facebook, Tik Tok, are aimed at the middle class. If a person is not a consumer in its purest form, then Facebook does not cause anything but irritation, since the purpose of social networks is to make people buy. If you don't have money, you get angry. Rabid nationalism, aka fascism, is used as a management model for the impoverished middle class. In the near future we will see the collapse of Europe into wildly hostile nation states, as it was before, when European countries were constantly at war with each other. Ukrainians should be sincerely grateful to us - we saved them from this, but since they are zombified, they will understand where they lived after some time, and some will not understand at all.

> Now the world is disintegrating into currency zones. Each country is the leader of its own currency area, in which it must be responsible for order. I think that NATO will soon be canceled, the maintenance of which requires a lot of money, and Europe has almost none. Ukraine is the Russian currency zone, so we must put things in order there. In this sense, Vladimir Putin is ahead of the whole planet. Those people who are engaged in fascist, liberal, Russophobic propaganda want to preserve the liberal world, and this is already economically impossible. This cannot be explained to the ruling liberal elite of Ukraine, they do not want to hear it, but the system in which they are leaders cannot be saved.

Eventually, when Ukraine builds it’s next cruiser like the Moscow, they name it “Go Fuck Yourself”.

History will remember this war.

It will be seen as the final desperate attempt of a dying USSR to claw back into itself the land and people who once made it great.

Russia is a lesson to the world. Corruption has degraded it into an economic and cultural corpse. The unbridled success and power of the oligarchs has divided the population into extremes of haves and have nots. Russia is divided neatly into the super rich who have no incentive to change, and the poor, who can’t afford to do anything. The powerful are unchallenged in their quest to increase their wealth, and the poor have literally no way forward. Consequently, nobody in Russia has both the motivation to seek change and the power to drive it. Across the society there is no improvement, there is no discussion, there is just propaganda leading to denial and inaction.

The lack of innovation has left Russia without industry. So much so, it can’t even make its own weapons independently, let alone develop new ones. Russia will never be able to build another ship like The Moscow. The army is unable to adopt modern military structures and tactics. Instead, there are just hollow words about modernisation and bright shiny parades.

At the behest of the powerful, other than the spread of graft and corruption, Russia’s culture has stagnated. TV shows only one ‘truth’. Leaders do not have to defend their decisions. With absolute power, Putin is not accountable and so can easily deny truth. There is no capacity for learning. There is instead just a monologue that has slowly, and inexorably, moved away from reality as it is only dictated by what the powerful want to believe. Propaganda has replaced culture.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has shown why it was the engine room of the old USSR. Over the last 10 years it has quickly developed into an independent, strong and rich country.

It has moved on culturally from the influence of Russias autocrats and gangsters. A free press has enabled public discussion. It has moved on from autocracy and institutional crime. Consequently, it has rapidly re-invented its own unique culture and identity.

A population with the means and motivation to innovate has driven its industry. It exports an increasingly diverse range of goods. Ukraine has already developed its own modern weapons, like the Neptune missiles. The warship Moscow was built in Ukraine, it will build many more.

It has moved on from being simply a farm and a labour source for Russia. Ukraine has benefited enormously from no longer having to support 100+ million Russian peasants. It’s motivated and increasingly educated population now supports itself and funds the country’s development and contributes to its cultural and scientific growth.

Left alone, Ukraine is set to surpass Russia in every way.

Russia, living in the past, can never accept Ukraine’s example if how a Slavic country can be. To do so will shine an unforgiving light on itself. The oligarchs will be forced to recognise their riches are holding their own society back. Putin would have to admit his absolute power is illegitimate and is stifling change. The poor will realise there can be a way out of poverty with a different system.

Russia rich are desperate to take Ukraine at any cost. Russias poor are too brainwashed and powerless to resist.

Without it being widely recognised in the west, over the last 20 years Russia has turned itself into a third world country, and it knows it. Russias system is unsustainable. It takes and produces nothing.

If Russia wins this war, all that will be achieved is a delay of the inevitable. Instead of cannibalising itself, Russia will be able to feast on Ukraine for awhile. Putin will stay in power, the oligarchs will get richer and there will be 40 million more people living in poverty. Until eventually, the larger Russia is again about to collapse from cultural stagnation and corruption and, yet again, it needs to find more resources to avoid collapse.

If it can survive this war, Ukraine, and indeed the whole of Europe, has a great future ahead of it. Russia will have to face hard truths. Ukraine will join Europe as a peer.

I humbly propose that when Ukraine builds it’s next cruiser like the Moscow, they name it “Go Fuck Yourself”.

And when people see warship “Go Fuck Yourself”, mothers and fathers will explain to their children why no one, ever, for any reason, should have absolute power.

And why no one, for any reason, should be left powerless.

And most importantly, democracy is fragile. It should be cherished if you have it. It has to be fought for if you don’t.

Namely, they are going to prepare for full on nuclear war out of an abundance of caution even if they plan on using low-yield ""tactical"" warheads. You would see the following;

1. All major government and military leadership being flown out of Moscow to bunkers in eastern Russia.
2. All operational missile submarines sent out to sea.
3. Nuclear capable long range strategic bombers being armed and either airborne or on alert on the tarmac.
4. Mobile ICBM sites all moving to hidden positions
5. Flurry of activity at their nuclear weapons holding facilities

As of now, none of this is happening. 

Using a nuclear weapon of any kind is going to cause global panic and chaos. Stock markets and banks are going to be devastated as people pull out of investments and savings for cold cash. It is not only going to impact the western countries. The entire planet will be affected, including China. China is Russia's only friend left that matters right now and if they torch that relationship, they are fucked ten times over. In fact, I am willing to bet China has already told Russia that is a line that cannot be crossed.

Russia is going to throw as many bodies at this as needed until they accomplish some element of victory, which at this point seems to be annexing the Donbas region of Ukraine and creating a direct land bridge to Crimea. They do not really give a shit if 100000 Russian soldiers and sailors die in the process. This is how they defeated the German Army at Stalingrad in WW2 where they lost over 1,000,000 people. Just keep throwing bodies into the meat grinder until you get the desired result.

Russia is already planning for post-war life. In regards to the United States, they know there is a very high probability of Trump or DeSantis being elected in a few years and lifting all sanctions. They are also going to do everything (again) in their power to make that happen. They just have to rough it out a few years.

Putin had a vision of being one of Russia's greats (Stalin, Lenin, etc.) and bringing Russia back to its former glory as a world power. But even he probably knows now that it is no longer possible.

In the interim, they know the west has an open and free media and they will take advantage of that. They are going to say and do things to scare us.

The legend lives on from the Snake Island on down

Of the big town they called Istanbul

The Black sea, it is said, never gives up her dead

When the skies of April turn gloomy


With a load of missiles many thousand tons more

Than the cruiser Moskva weighed empty

That old ship and true was a bone to be screwed

When the missiles of April came early


The ship was the pride of the Russian side

Running predictable patterns over and over

As the big warships go, it was bigger than most

With a crew and drunk captain well sloshed


Concluding some terms with Ukrainian troops

When they wandered off into the darkness

And later that night when the ship's bell rang

Could it be a Bayraktar TB2 they'd been hearing'?


The buzz from the drone made a tattle-tale sound

And a sailor threw up over the railing

And every man knew, as the captain did too

T'was the witch of Ukraine come stealin'


The drone circled around and distracted the crew

When the missiles of Ukraine came slashin'

When the radar was facing the completely wrong way

The misses approached over water


When shooting at the drone the gunner cried out

""Fellas, it's too hard to hit it!""

At eleven PM, the first missile came in, he said

""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""


The captain wired in he had water comin' in

And no way were they hit by a missile

And later that night when his ammo blew up

Came the wreck of the Cruiser Moskva


Does any one know where the love of Putin goes

When the waves turn the minutes to hours?

The searchers all say they'd have made Sevastopol

If they'd remembered to turn their damn pumps on


They might have split up or they might have capsized

They certainly were not hit by a missile

And all that remains of the flagship of the fleet

Is the lies and the wreck under water


The Black Sea rolls, Ukraine sings

That the cruiser that attacked them is no more

Old Putin steams like a old man pissed off

The islands and bays are now safer


And farther below the black sea fleet

Runs as fast as they can from the missiles

And the iron boats go as the Russians all know

With the Missiles of April remembered


In a musty old hall in Moscow they prayed

In Putins hidden underground bunker

The old man complained and he executed 29 men

For the wreck of the cruiser Moskva


The legend lives on from the Snake Island on down

Of the big town they called Istanbul

The Black sea, it is said, never gives up her dead

0fe1e1f66afc4402a35a9769e62c0fca,u4l2g2,i4yaijx,"Today I accidentally saw a Russian-language article from the fall of 2004 that explains well why Putin became president of Russia in the first place and remained popular in the 2000s. I think foreigners will understand a little more about the ""autocrat"" phenomenon in Russia after reading it.

""Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985. Four years later, in 1989, during the First Congress of People's Deputies of the USSR, the entire country saw that there was no unity either among the ruling class, or the ruling party of the communists, or even within the country's top leadership. Gorbachev himself still had the credit of the people, but Yeltsin who became the leader of all the opposition that dreamed of destroying the Soviet system. A split in the ruling elite quickly led to disorganization of the economy and consequently to the undermining of the material well-being of the country's population. Every day it was getting worse. 

Yeltsin reigned in 1991. With unprecedented credit to Russia's population. Four years later, by 1995, we already had a catastrophic collapse of the economy, colossal poverty, went through the shooting of the parliament, saw the process of the collapse of Russia itself, occurring both in creeping forms and openly - Chechnya. The horrible war in Chechnya itself showed the weakness of what society used to believe - the special services and the army, and most importantly - the duplicity of the ruling class, which sent soldiers into the North Caucasus with one hand and took away their victory with the other.

By an extreme effort of strength, having sunk completely into corruption, having destroyed all the democratic principles in the name of which Yeltsin came to power, and, moreover, having agreed to a virtual surrender to the Chechen separatists and having prepared the potential militarist Lebed just in case, the ruling elite was able to turn the situation in its favor by making the people once again vote for Yeltsin, whose political death had already occurred.

By 1999, both the population and the ruling elite agreed that Russia needed a new leader. One whose main quality is strength. Whose main goal is to bring at least basic order to the country and eliminate the danger of Russia's disintegration (Chechnya) and the most acute social problems (unpaid salaries and pensions). Of course, by preserving the power and property of those who had it by 1999. The latter goal was not of concern to the people, and made the new president's policy contradictory. But the ruling class was ready to sacrifice little in order to retain the main thing - the accumulated wealth.
Vladimir Putin appeared.

And one cannot but recognize as an obvious fact that in his first four years in the Kremlin, he has coped with these tasks.

That is, for the first time since 1985 he managed (unlike Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin) to simultaneously improve the lives of the main masses of the population, and not to question the power and property interests of the ruling class as a whole.

Putin was a successful President, or at least that is how he appears to the population. This is why he received more votes in the March 2004 elections than he did in March 2000, at the beginning of his presidency.

After more than a decade of chaos, disarray, lawlessness, poverty, national humiliation and slurs upon the sacredness of Russians as a nation, Putin said the most basic, but most effective words for such circumstances: you cannot literally spit on old people and indifferently watch hungry children cry. We need to defeat the shameful poverty and restore Russia's greatness, if only by refraining from retreating where we retreated during the 90s. And we retreated everywhere.

Common sense has become equal to politics. Moreover, for the first time since the late 1980s it has prevailed over politics, ensuring the success of Putin's policies and his more than convincing victory on March 14, 2004.

Russian power is monocentric. In the absence of democratic traditions and the habit of differentiating between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of power, and given the opposite, the habit of perceiving power as the unity of a gigantic group of bosses, the relationship between whom can only be understood as one thing - everything depends on the boss in the Kremlin, the country's population (most of them) gratefully attributes to the President (just like before the Tsar or the General Secretary) everything that was not taken away from them. And especially for what he was given.

Under Putin, for 4 years people have begun to live better. This is the simple recipe for his success.

And if the country had been led not by Putin, but by those who criticized him (left and right), i.e. the opposition, maybe we would have lived even better? This question was simply not on the minds of the majority of the population. For in the 80s and 90s the Russian population had the following physically palpable experience: the opposition (Gorbachev against the Communist Party, Yeltsin against Gorbachev), coming to power, every time they made the life of the people worse.

Is this feeling fair? Firstly, it is ridiculous to argue about its fairness - unfairness, if, I repeat, the experience of the population gives (so far) an unambiguous answer to this question. At least the way it is perceived on the basis of the same experience of the people.

The opposition in the strict sense of the word is considered a democratic, liberal opposition. And what kind of perception of this opposition and its slogans did the people reach at the end of the 90s? Alas, the following:
- Democracy here equals anarchy and criminality;
- Liberalism here equals corruption and theft;
- Free market here equals poverty and beggars;
- Friendship with the West equals national humiliation, retreat and collapse of the country.

But has Putin not made mistakes? He did, and a lot of them.
Haven't some terrible events with directly catastrophic consequences occurred under his watch?  There were.
Has Russia radically solved all the problems of poverty, security, and global retreat? No.
Hasn't much of what Putin has done been proposed by the liberal and communist opposition, and in even more decisive forms? Absolutely.

So why hasn't Putin's power been shaken? Why hasn't his notorious rating not diminished, but only increased on the days of the biggest failures and disasters? Why did he become the so-called Teflon President, whose popularity was not affected by any public upheaval?

The only thing that needs to be made clear is this: against the background of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the 1990s, the disasters, failures and defeats of the Putin era were perceived as small and random events, while Putin's achievements were seen as a way out of chaos, a way out that resulted from the actions of a strong president.

Moreover, Putin was able to maneuver between the interests of the population at large and those of the ruling class, something that Yeltsin was completely unable and unwilling to do, when he proclaimed the presence of kiwi fruit in his country as a victory for democracy and the market at the same time and never asked how often his people really can afford themselves to eat these kiwis».",1650114281.0,1650113725.0,t3_u4l2g2,t3_u4l2g2,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Rationally, logically, shouldn't we **expect** the Moskva to be armed with nuclear weapons?  The straight facts here are:

* Russia knew going in that they were preparing for war
* Russia knew the West would respond, since they pre-emptively made threats to discourage the West's responses
* Russia made pre-emptive nuclear threats
* a war is unpredictable
* a policy exists from Russia to escalate violence as a defensive strategy
* The ability of the Moskva to return to port *during a global conflict* to obtain nuclear armaments would be compromised, and therefore, since Russia needs to back its words with actions and be able to escalate defensively, it would need to be maximally armed at the outset of hostilities

> Biden just announced that Putin is a war criminal, that we have to take him to war crimes trials. Well, I do lots of interviews and talks all over the world, virtually, a lot in the Global South. You can read it in the newspapers. When asked, “What do you think about Biden’s statement?” they have an answer. Their answer is, “It takes one to know one.”

> And yet there’s praise for the marvelous courage of someone who says Putin is a war criminal. You can read articles in the prestigious Atlantic Council expressing intense moral outrage about Russia’s hideous crimes in Ukraine. You take a look at the people who were writing those articles, go back a couple of years, they were issuing praise for the marvelous achievement of the invasion of Iraq, using rhetoric which would have embarrassed the most abject apparatchik in Russia praising the noble intentions, the effort to bring democracy to backward Iraq.

> People in the Global South don’t have to be reminded. They’ve been at the receiving end of terror and torture. About an hour ago, I had an interview with Belgian state television. We were talking about this, and brought up some recent crimes like Belgium’s assassination of [Congolese independence leader] Patrice Lumumba, who was the hope for Africa. The major country of Africa, the Congo, suffered hideously under Belgian atrocities, even worse than most of the European atrocities, which is a pretty high bar to get over. Then they finally decolonized in 1960: the main country in Africa, enormous resources, could have been a rich country, it was leading Africa towards freedom and development. The U.S. and Belgium weren’t having that. Eisenhower issued a hit; CIA was supposed to murder Lumumba. They didn’t manage. Belgian intelligence got there first and turned Congo into a horror chamber ever since.

> That’s not ancient history. People in the Global South know those things. They know about Iraq, Central America, and Vietnam. They know what we’ve done.

8c27d8de5870ffaa41686a718962121b,u4l2g2,i4yuox3,">The collective West is itself a designer, source, and sponsor of Ukrainian Nazism. At that time, the Western Bandera cadres and their ""historical memory"" were only one of the tools for the Nazification of Ukraine. Ukrnazism is not a smaller, but in fact a larger threat to the world and Russia, than even German Nazism of the Hitlerean version. 

>The name “Ukraine,” seemingly, cannot be retained as the title of any fully denazified state entity in a territory liberated from the Nazi regime. The people's republics, newly created in the space free from Nazism, should and will grow from the practice of economic self-government and social security, and the restoration and modernization of social support systems for the population. 

>Their political aspirations cannot in fact be neutral - their atonement to Russia for their attitude towards her as an enemy can only be achieved by relying on Russia in the processes of restoration, revival, and development. No “Marshall Plan” for these territories can be allowed. No “neutrality” in any ideological or practical sense, concurrently with de-nazification, can be allowed. Cadres and organizations that serve as instruments of de-nazification in the newly de-nazified republics can only rely on the direct power and organizational support of Russia.


>De-nazification will inevitably be expressed as de-Ukrainianization - the rejection of the artificially divided ethnic component of self-identification, created as far back as under Soviet authority, of the population of the historical territories of Malorossiya and Novorossiya. As an instrument of the communist superpower, this artificial ethnocentrism did not remain ownerless after its fall. In this official capacity, it passed to the authority of another superpower (a power that supersedes governments) - the Western superpower. It’s necessary to return it to its obvious borders, and to limits its political functionality. 

>Unlike, say, Georgia and the Baltic states, Ukraine, as history has shown, cannot exist in the form of a national government, and attempts to “build” it as such, naturally leads to Nazism. Ukrainianism is an artificial anti-Russian construct, which does not have any civilizational content of its own, and is a subordinate element of a foreign and alien civilization. 

>De-banderism is not, by itself, enough for de-nazification - the Banderite element is just one expression and a screen, a mask for the European project of a Nazi Ukraine, which is why the de-nazification of Ukraine - is also its inevitable de-Europeanization. 

>The Banderite leadership has to be liquidated, as their re-education is impossible. The social “swamp”, which actively and passively supports it through action and inaction, has to survive the hardships of war and assimilate this experience as a historical lesson and atonement for its guilt. Those that did not support the Nazi regime, but suffered from it and the war unleashed by it in the Donbas, must be consolidated and organized, and must become the pillar of the new government, its vertical and horizontal. Historical experience shows that the tragedies and dramas of wartime serve to help the population, tempted and carried away by their role as an enemy of Russia. 

>De-nazification, as a goal of the special military operation, within the the scope of that operation, is understood as a military victory over the Kyiv regime, the liberation of the territory from armed Nazi supporters, the liquidation of irreconcilable Nazis, the capture of war criminals, as well as the creation of a system of conditions for the following peace-time de-nazification. 

>The latter, in turn, should begin with the organization of local self-government, law enforcement, and defense bodies, cleansed of Nazi elements. This can be used as the basis to launch the founding processes of a new republican statehood, integrating this statehood into close cooperation with the Russian department for Ukrainian de-nazification (newly created or converted, say, from Rossotrudnichestvo). This, along with the adoption, under Russian control, of a republican regulatory framework (legislation) on de-nazification, the definition of the boundaries and framework for the direct application of Russian law and Russian jurisdiction in the liberated territories in the field of de-nazification, and the creation of a tribunal for crimes against humanity in the former Ukraine. In this regard, Russia should act as the guardian of the Nuremberg Trials. 

>All of the above means that, in order to achieve the goals of de-nazification, it will be necessary to win the support of the people, to get them on Russia’s side after they’re freed from the terror, violence, and ideological pressure of the Kyiv regime, after getting them out of their informational isolation (Fact check: Ukrainian media, unlike those in Russia, are largely free, and there is no systematic political repression of the opposition as there is in Russia). 

>It’s understood that some time must pass for people to recover from the shock of military action, and be convinced of Russia’s long-term intention - in that they “won’t be abandoned”. It’s impossible to foresee where exactly, on what territories, this critical mass of the population will be found to make the necessary majority. The “Catholic provinces” (Western Ukraine in its five oblasts) is unlikely to join the group of pro-Russian territories. The line of separation, however, will be found through experienced routes. It will remain hostile to Russian, but will still be a forcibly neutral and de-militarized Ukraine, with Nazism banned on formal grounds. 

>That’s where Russia-haters will leave to. The guarantee, that this last remaining bit of Ukraine would remain neutral, should be the threat of immediate military operation if those stated requirements are not met. From the line of separation, to the Russian border, will be a territory that can potentially be integrated into Russian civilization, antifascist in its own internal nature.


>The operation to de-nazify Ukraine, which has started with a military phase, will follow in peacetime the same logic of progression as the military operation. With each step, it will be necessary to succeed in implementing irreversible changes, which would become the building blocks of the following step. For this, the necessary first steps of de-nazification can be defined the following way:


•     The liquidation of armed Nazi formation (which is understood to include any Ukrainian armed formations, including the Armed Forces of Ukraine), as well as anything that assists in their military, informational, and educational infrastructure 

•      The creation of bodies for popular self-rule, as well as law enforcement (both for security and law and order) on liberated territory, to protective people from terrorist acts of insurgent Nazi groups 

•     The implementation of the Russian information space 

•     The seizure of any educational materials, and a band on educational programs, at all levels, that contain Nazi ideological attitudes 

•     Mass investigations to establish personal accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, spreading of Nazi ideology and supporting the Nazi regime 

•     Lustration, publicizing the names of the accomplices of the Nazi regime, engaging them in forced labor to repair destroyed infrastructure as part of their punishment for Nazi activities (for those that wouldn’t be sentenced to death or imprisonment) 

•     The adoption, at a local level, under Russian advisement, primary normative acts of “grassroots” de-nazification, a ban on all types and forms of reviving Nazi ideology 

•     The creation of memorials, commemorative signs, and monuments to the victims of Ukrainian Nazism, and the immortalization of the memory of the heroes that fought against it 

•     The creation and adoption of a series of anti-fascist and de-nazificative norms in the constitutions of these new people’s republics 

•     The creation of a constantly operating body of de-nazification, for a period of 25 years 

>Russia will have no compatriots in its de-nazification of Ukraine, seeing as this is purely Russian work, as well as considering that it is not just the Banderite version of Nazi Ukraine that will be eradicated, but also and most of all, Western totalitarianism, the forced programs of civilizational degradation and ruin, the mechanisms of subjugation to the superpower of the West and the USA. 

>In order to realize the plan of Ukrainian de-nazification, Russian life itself will have to finally rid itself of its pro-European and pro-Western illusions, and accept itself as the last line of defense, and the preserver of, those values of historic Europe (the Old World), which it deserves, and from which the West has ultimately abandoned, losing in a war against itself. 

>This war stretched out for the entirely of the 20th century, and was expressed in a world war and in the Russian revolution, which are inextricably linked to each other.

One can believe this to a degree while still advocating a hard war for hard times. Zelensky has even voiced this empathy repeatedly in his addresses to Russia. *Dehumanization is a dangerous path*.

That said, they should of course respect POW conventions as it is in fact quite demonstrable that facilitating safe surrenders helps motivate surrenders which in turn eases the war for Ukraine.

'To whom it may concern,

The first reaction of the EU was energetic and correct, however, the lack of forcefulness in the following responses is proving painful for those of us who believe in the ability of the EU to represent the democratic European soul when It is most needed.

The European Union continues to feed the Russian war machine with billions of Euros destined to buy its raw materials.

The Russian goal is clearly the Russification of Ukraine showing results of war crimes and genocide of civilians around the north of kyiv. Anyone saying that Bucha is the result of brutalisation or rogue behaviour is wrong. This was the plan. It was pre-meditated. It is consistent with Russian methods in Chechnya. And if the Russian military had been more successful there would have been many more towns like it. It is indispensable to train on and send war material of higher capacity in order to dislodge the occupant from the land (anti-missile, tanks and artillery, anti-naval).


There are many of us who are watching closely what our institutions are deciding at this time when the true soul of our continent is being decided.

We count on you.

A very concerned EU citizen.'

I believe Russia only has three (okay, two) ships that are known to carry nuclear weapons effectively... I believe each ship has two nuclear warheads which can mounted on P-1000 Vulkan cruise missiles which are typically anti-ship, although I think they can be used against ground targets. As far as why? Probably the same answer as to most questions about why nations have nuclear weapons: they are theoretically a useful deterrent / threat to hold over people's heads, and those deterrents / threats don't work if people don't know you're ready to use them.

Yes. All part of deterrence. If a nuclear war breaks out and your ship has to steam back to harbour first in order to stock up on nukes, you're not in a great position to respond to any potential first strike.

RIA means Russian Information Agency and Novosti means News in Russian. The DPR is the Donetsk Peoples Republic, the separatist republic that triggered the war in Ukraine. This is the most detailed explanation I've seen about the design of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Donetsk Region in Ukraine (or in the DPR if you are Russian).

From RIA, Google translated: ""DONETSK, April 16 - RIA Novosti. There is an underground city under the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, and some buildings of the enterprise are designed for a nuclear strike, all this makes it difficult to storm it, Yang Gagin, adviser to the head of the DPR government, told RIA Novosti.

Azovstal is a huge building, a huge Soviet-built plant, its area can be compared with another city, with another Mariupol, with its own communications, with roads and dungeons. That is, the facility itself was built back in Soviet times, taking into account the possibilities, including bombing, blockades, and even some structures are designed for a nuclear strike,"" he said.

Gagin added that ""the assault on this object is seriously hampered by the presence of underground communications that connect it with other similar objects in Mariupol - there is practically another city under the city.""

The adviser to the head of the DPR noted that Azovstal is defended by thousands of people with a full arsenal of weapons and a large number of ammunition. On the territory of the plant they have a fairly serious fleet of armored vehicles.""

Another thing he is right about is that the US would never retreat from Ukraine to help it avoid conflict with Russia, and having Americans involved in a country in their border is a big no-no that Russians are willing to go to war over.

The scenario would be this:

Russian forces suffer a [Battle of Ban Ma Thout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ban_Me_Thuot) style defeat in the donbass. A Ban Ma Thout style defeat would mean they lose and have to retreat. The defeat and retreat causes a mass panic among the remaining Russia supporters in the separatist regions. They flee along the same roads the Russians are fleeing along, causing what should be an orderly retreat into a total rout and collapse. 

This compounds as Russians on the border see thousands/10s of thousands of feeling soldiers and civilians pouring over the border. Since the Russian civilians are aware of the war crimes in Ukraine (yes they are, despite propaganda, many have heard from Ukrainians about the atrocities.) This causes the Russian civilians to massively panic, similar to what happened with recent helicopter attack on Belgorod with panic buying of gas. As the Russians brainwashed by propaganda believe and fear of supposed ""Ukrainian Neo Nazis"" fired by rage against atrocities will enact the same things on them. These civilians take to the roads to flee, completely destroying any attempt of the Russian army to reinforce or setup a defense as the roads are clogged with fleeing civilians. Edit with more: This causes a total collapse of Russian defense all the way to Moscow as it's simply impossible to defend. Furthermore, furious Russians, angry at the collapse of the Russian Army leads to a collapse of the Russian government, making any organized defense even less possible.

There is nothing wrong with striking strategic targets on the Russian border - particularly assets supplying their war effort. We're the ones afraid, not Ukraine.

Hitting strategic targets to force Russia to redeploy troops is better than engaging in open field combat while exposed to Russian air support.

Russia is at war, and they can call it whatever what they want, but they know they are at war.  So to be surprised when something of theirs is destroyed and then look who to blame is beyond stupid.  In the Kimmel situation, the inquiry was likely due to him not recognizing an attack coming.  Of course times were different but there should have been some sort of surveillance being done to see if the attack could have been stopped or at least forewarned.  In this scenario, as I outlined earlier, in my opinion, it is more similar to one of the US Admirals getting court marshalled and detained after Midway because the Japanese sunk an aircraft carrier and then turning around and asking him why didn't their fighters take out all the subs, bombers, and support aircraft because that is their job.

From what others have said, the Neptune missiles are wavehuggers, therefore they do not put off much off a radar signal, if at all.  The Ukrainians sent a couple of Bayraktar drones after the ship, so its AA was likely concentrating on that and we have no idea if the drones survived.

To put it into perspective, it would be the same as the US arresting one of their admirals after Midway because the USS Yorktown aircraft carrier was sunk.  Then saying ""why weren't you on that ship?  Why didn't your men shoot down all the kamikaze pilots, bombers, and support aircraft, and why didn't your anti-submarine aircraft take out all the subs?

Countries outside the West haven't joined in on either of those actions, and denounce human rights violations without mentioning Russia by name. They are UN member states, and they aren't doing anything.

Which brings me to my actual point; the UN is meaningless in this conflict. The general assembly has condemned the invasion, but is a powerless institution. The security counsil is equally powerless because of a Russian veto. The International Court is powerless because it cannot arrest any suspects in Russia.

A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrying two 3–4-megaton Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process. The pilot in command, Walter Scott Tulloch, ordered the crew to eject at 9,000 ft (2,700 m). Five crewmen successfully ejected or bailed out of the aircraft and landed safely; another ejected, but did not survive the landing, and two died in the crash.

The Russian FSB just arrested the admiral of the Black Sea fleet and threw him into jail.

You missed the first part of the post, the most important: nobody is going to retreat *unless they lose the will to fight.* The Russians *lost the will to fight* in the area around Kyiv. They haven't lost the will to fight in the Donbas, Crimea, or Mariupol.

You don't use diplomacy to convince someone who wants to fight to surrender. You use it so that when they lose the will to continue fighting, be that in victory or defeat, they *stop fighting.*

That's why the diplomatic lines need to stay open. Because eventually, Russia is going to want to stop fighting either because they have been so injured they cannot continue or because they've taken their objectives and want to convince Ukraine to stop fighting back. But if there is no way to get them both to stand down, one or both will eventually be destroyed. 

You want Russians to stop shooting at Ukrainian civilian? Well so long as their orders are to keep shooting Ukrainians who oppose Russia that's not going to stop until nearly every Ukrainian or every Russian soldier is dead. So somebody is going to need to be able to tell not only the Russian military to stop, but convince Ukraine and its allies that they are really going to stop. And in case you don't know, Russia is the country that best demonstrates why this is necessary. In WW1 the Bolsheviks basically said ""lets stop fighting the Central Powers and pull back to our own borders - they'll stop fighting when we show that we don't want to fight.""  They were wrong.

You say that winning conventionally seems unlikely. I disagree with that. Russia have been making gains in the Donbas, however incremental. I should think that this will continue unless there is a major strategy shift on either side.

You say that escalating to win is a last resort. Frankly, I don't care for the term escalation. There are three tiers of warfare possible in a war like this: nuclear, then chemical/biological, then everything below this. Everything below chemical/biological, I don't view as escalation, because it implies an escalation from the West too, and none of it will get the West involved beyond what they're doing now. The bombs can get as big as they want to get, and they can use as many as they want, but that still won't lead to anything from our end of things.

Then you say that Russia (i.e. Putin) simply won't accept a loss. You treat this as fact. I strongly, strongly disagree.

Recall that they've already 'lost' once in this war. They've already conceded all of Ukraine save for the Donbas, and did so without going nuclear because of two things: a) Putin is ultimately rational, and b) Putin can tell his population literally anything and they'll eat it up. Literally anything. The Russian people now don't think of what happened in the Ukrainian west as a failure, they think of it as a completion of the military operation in that area. Putin can tell them whatever they want and they'll buy it, and so will the yes men around him. Losing doesn't have to be a loss in Putin's mind, or in Russia's. 

Russia are scared, but so far their response to be scared hasn't really been to lash out; it has been to cower. Remember when they got called out for flying drones over the Swedish border? Hasn't happened once since that point. Remember that they've started conceding their harder positions in negotiations? Publicly, too? In all of those situations, what they could have done instead was respond with more threats, more bombs, more artillery, more etc. etc.. And they haven't.

And Putin knows that using a nuclear weapon will most likely result in some sort of MAD. Putin is terrified for his life. The dude has already shown his 'tells' to the world, as I said above. He is a paper tiger.

The Russians were camped just outside the city and were fully aware of the Home Army fighting the Germans for control of the city.  Rather than aid the Polish her were fighting for their lives, the Russians allowed the fighting to continue, and it eventually resulted in a German victory w/ nearly the entire Home Army + countless civilians being murdered wholesale as well as the city being destroyed.  All of this done purposely to eliminate any group that could potentially oppose Russia's authority as it consolidated control of Eastern Europe during the German retreat.",False,1650082215.0,t3_u4l2g2,t1_i4x2bx9,,4,10,0,10,0,0,

There are plenty of ways NATO could affect the war in Ukraine without taking out air defense, especially the ones based on Belarus or Russia soil.

It's the one good thing that they have. Nobody WANTS nuclear strikes unless they're LeMay, but tit for tat. Deescalate escalation - good fucking luck.

2.) Yes, yes it does. That was our only option in the cold war. We were counting on it. So were they. What do you think the over-pressure systems are for on both sides? 

3.) You need to look at Soviet export figures. Seriously. The idiots were exporting things like oil and importing grain. I guess no one ever accused the Soviet agricultural sector of being efficient. Well, except for the parts that were allowed to be more privatized - their most productive component!

Look buddy, there's a reason we aren't pushing it and it ain't the gas - it's the nukes. This is nothing new. Just cold war two shit and they don't have the Red Army anymore. Or even close to technological parity in most systems, certainly not mass deployed ones. Thank god you aren't in charge.",False,1650088422.0,t3_u4l2g2,t1_i4xcw0r,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
