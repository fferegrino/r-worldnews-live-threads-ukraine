1. **Killing members of the group**: [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-e3756976cf33cf5de29aa62d61ea7eb6) reported over 40,000 civilian deaths, including women and children. This scale of loss clearly indicates Russia's actions are leading to a significant loss of life among the Ukrainian population.

2. **Causing serious bodily or mental harm**: The existence of a 'torture center' in Kherson, Ukraine, run by Russian forces, as reported by [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/13/ukraine-russian-torture-center-kherson), unmistakably contributes to serious bodily and mental harm.

3. **Deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to cause physical destruction**: Russia's deliberate and systematic attacks on civilian targets in Ukraine, leading to a near obliteration of everyday life, as described in [The New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/23/world/europe/ukraine-civilian-attacks.html?smid=nytcore-android-share), certainly align with this criterion.

4. **Preventing births within the group**: The [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/ukrainian-psychologist-sexual-violence-ukrainian-soldiers-endured-the-times-2023-6) report on the sexual violence, including castration, against Ukrainian POWs, illustrates a horrific strategy that effectively prevents births within the group.

5. **Forcibly transferring children**: The [story on Jurist](https://www.jurist.org/news/2023/07/russia-says-700000-ukraine-children-brought-to-russia-during-war/) documents that Russia has forcibly transferred 700,000 Ukrainian children during the war, fitting the last criterion of genocide.

We ALL know the language Putin and Russian officials have used about their desire to erase the independent Ukraine and their national identity. This is clearly not only an attempt at a land grab but a deliberate and vengeful quest to put an end to an entire peoples that Russian leadership does not believe deserve their own identity.

It starts with the stuff we already know, Ukraine is progressing slow but methodically. However a point that caught his attention is that Russia's confirmed visual loses is a little bit higher than Ukraine, which is spectacular for Ukraine but very weird.

When explaining why he makes an ""explain like Im 5"" drawn break down of Russia's defensive lines and how defenses usually work and then use that drawing in the map to show how it works. When approaching the main defensive line Russia should be focusing in slowing down or stopping the attackers by punishing them with artillery and aviation so they get too weakened to the main defensesive line, if they get there.

Instead, what is happening is that Russia is sending its reserves to stop the attackers, which allows Ukraine to be the ones pummeling them with artillery, which accounts for the higher number of Russian casualties despite defending.

He explains that the reason Russia is making this mistake is that either Russia is prematurely sending its reserves so that the line doesnt quickly move into the main defensive line, to claim that the counteroffensive has failed or worse because Russia doesnt trust in its main defensive line. Because if the main line has few artillery and is manned by mobiks its very likely that it is not a great defense. But whatever the case, the main problem in using prematurely the professional reserves is that if Ukraine breaks through the main defensive line, there will not be enough reserve troops to clog the Ukranian breakthrough, which should be the ONLY job of the professional reserve, not to be sent to fight to keep the main line from being even reached. This is specially critical in the south center attack vector, because Russia only has one main defensive line and a breakthrough there could cause a good portion of the Russian front to collapse.",1688857660.0,1688851500.0,t3_14tt4cw,t3_14tt4cw,,0,110,0,110,0,0,

-



*A few thoughts on DPICM. Providing cluster munitions to Ukraine, at this stage, could have a significant impact beyond what other capabilities might achieve. Despite the drawbacks, unlocking this stockpile has important implications for the course of Ukraine's offensive.*


*Ukraine's offensive is limited by the artillery ammunition available. The US, and other countries, provided a significant amount for this operation. Much of this was borrowed from South Korea. Without this ammunition it is difficult to imagine this offensive taking place.*


*Progress has been slow, difficult, and without sustained breakthroughs thus far. While UA retains the bulk of its combat power, artillery use rate is likely higher than anticipated, especially as the past weeks have seen a largely attritional approach.*


*Consequently, Ukraine's hardest limit is proably not manpower, or equipment, but arty ammunition. This is foremost about the numbers. Providing DPICM gives access to a sizable stockpile of artillery ammo that can alleviate the time pressure on UA operations.*


*With DPICM the US is also in a much better position to sustain Ukraine's war effort into next year, which requires significant amounts of artillery ammunition on a monthly basis. While other capabilities may be great to have, providing DPICM may prove more impactful.*


*While UA retains options, the offensive may culminate whenever the ammunition runs low. Extending that timeline is critical. I wont get into the debate on effectiveness vs the risks, dud rates, etc. My view is these considerations are ultimately best left for Ukraine to weigh.*

people fawned over the legacy of Abrams destroying swaths of Iraqi T-72s and thought the same would be repeated in Ukraine.

The situation was drastically different in the gulf and Iraq wars however, and the T-72s fought by the US army were far less technologically advanced  than the T-72s, T-80s and  T-90s of the Russian military. 

Furthermore the battlefield itself is different, wide open desert versus rolling farmland. Mushy fields slow down rapid advances, buildings and trees can hide anti-tank positions and tanks themselves, and artillery can be called down on you far more effectively.

Combine this with Ukraine not having air superiority (as compared to the US's air dominance of Iraq) and you have a recipe not for overwhelming success, but attrition warfare. 

Peoples assumption that the induction of 100 or so western MBTs would suddenly allow Ukraine to bust through the Russian lines like they were paper holding back an NFL linebacker set unrealistic expectations for Ukrainian servicemen. The fact is, the battlefield is in stark contrast to the one the US faced with the same vehicles in Iraq. Hopefully people have more realistic expectations about what these vehicles mean for Ukraine, and can adjust their expectations accordingly. 

Also reach out to their senators and congresspeople to tell them to support larger weapon shipments to Ukraine, to help give them the edge in that attritonal battle.

Ultimately, like everyone from Alexander to the United States, the Soviets realized what everyone else did. Afghanistan is just not governable. It's not the losses that made them fold in Afghanistan - they had exponentially more in WWI, their civil war, and WWII.

What will crack Russia is the question of: *""are these losses worth it?""*

Time will tell. Their Afghanistan withdrawal coincided with (or was accelerated/caused) the collapse of all the USSR's institutions. But my point is that numbers of casualties alone can't be compared against other wars when judging the sociopolitical appetite for war.

However: WWI losses *devastated* an entire generation across Europe and that was with a much higher birth rate than today and a much younger average population.

So it does present an interesting question - are the current levels of loss unsustainable for Russia? The cold hard fact of the matter is that if they assume all Russian lives are expendable and people won't object, then no. What will make the difference is if and when the losses become something that has a measurable and significant impact on daily life, and it does look like it's heading that way - it won't just be a distant war like Afghanistan was for either the USSR or the US, it will be ""oh, Sergei who used to work here died at the front"" and that will be true for everywhere, for multiple people, and vacancies will go unfilled because the people who could fill them are dead.

We know for a fact that most of those 'better' tanks were never upgraded properly. Ukraine has seized numerous vehicles where the upgrade package was never installed, and/or the upgrades were stripped. They have been selling the upgraded ones to foreign buyers, and not bothering to upgrade their own. And Russia has lost somewhere around four thousand tanks in Ukraine. The upgraded ones have mostly been destroyed already. Forget T-72s, they are fielding the same exact T-55s that got slaughtered in 73 Easting.

Russia simply doesn't have a modern tank army anymore. They wouldn't be pulling hundreds of Soviet-era relics out of deep storage if they still had a lot of modern tanks.

Now that said, I agree that we're not going to see a giant tank battle, because Russia can't field a giant tank army anymore. Right now it's all.mine fields and artillery. But they've already run out of arty ammo, and they're running out of arty barrels. Conversely, Ukraine has yet to send most of their new armor into the field. Just a few Leopards here and there.

Many people are framing the counteroffensive along of the lines of gains in territory, and in that reference, this Ukrainian counteroffensive has been moving slowly, when compared to the last counteroffensive around Kharkiv, let alone other large operations in recent history - such as the two recent conflicts in Iraq, where you could watch the territory lines creep by the hour. It's not that it's an irrational failure of people in general - many have been habitually trained by media and history to understand territory gained as a measure of successes for armies and empires.

So viewed from that angle this latest offensive seems to be glacial - which has been the point pro-Russian news sources seem intent to go on and on about. ""You didn't move more than a kilometer on the map, this is a complete failure!""

The reality is, this Ukrainian counteroffensive has goals far beyond gains in territory. The Ukrainians have been focused on other things. First and foremost, they are out to preserve the lives of their troops and save the Ukrainians in occupied territory, opting to be safer rather than sorrier. Second, they are focused on ripping apart the ability of the Russians to conduct a war, from the front line soldiers to the rear echelons, in order to continually intensify the dilemma for Russia as to whether continuing the conflict is worth the continuing costs to their armed forces, economy and populous. And at least from where some people sit (as well as many in the various governments and militaries supporting Ukraine), the counteroffensive is \*going to plan\*.

Right now, Ukraine is setting up for what is looking like a 3-sided encirclement of the Bakhmut area, with full fire control on the 4th. The Russians have shown a significant willingness to commit an extraordinary amount of forces to Bakhmut to save it, since Putin seems to have an obsession of trying to take and maintain control of things he can point to on a map. Diverting forces away from that encirclement push only weakens that grinder.

In addition, pushing towards Donetsk would put troops into an area of elevated risk. They'd likely be throwing their forces into even more heavily prepared defenses with extensive mining and trenches in place, and more intact logistical support since they're closer to the Russian infrastructure. They'd also be working with reduced artillery, anti-air and mine-clearing support and rely on longer logistical lines that would be at risk from enemy fire and interdiction.

I'll say that is Kremlin propaganda numbers, made up by Grigory Karasin, Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Federation Council (upper house of the Russian parliament).

 **Ukraine say about 20000 children are deported to Russia.** About 750 have returned home to Ukraine.

Why such a high number? 1) Putin got an arrest warrant for war crimes regarding deporting children . 2) Compensate  for the fact that birth rate is back to levels of the 90s. 3) fear mongering, to incite peace talks.

Now being used primarily for the role it was designed for, HIMARS is showing it fills that role perfectly.

That, improved counterbattery radar, and I'd say improved familiarity with the NATO standard 155mm artillery along with battlefield experience are making the Ukraine crews very fast and accurate.

The fourth step, which Ukraine only seldom gets to do, is to splurge its artillery fires on enemy front line fortifications — something that’s only safe to do if the enemy artillery can’t shoot you back. 

However, take the actual claimed figures of destroyed Russian artillery with a grain of salt. We have no way to get these figures on most days.

Much of the time they're just attacking in the same place they've attacked a dozen times before. If the front lines don't move, the trenches, ammo dumps, HQs, logistics schedule, and everything else doesn't have to move either.

--------

Pretty much by definition a breakthrough is going to be a rapidly evolving situation that they need to react to and alter plans for, quickly. If you're really bad at that....well, the reserves will have a lot of trouble doing that if your communication and orders are poor and if you struggle to quickly adapt logistics to keep the troops supplied at a new/rapidly changing front line.",False,1688870128.0,t3_14tt4cw,t1_jr7oa4v,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

What's more, sustaining casualties is a ""good"" thing, in that it means you are engaged in combat, which means you are wearing the other side down. That's because my understanding of Soviet doctrine was built around the idea that they could sustain more losses and eventually grind their opponent down. To make matters worse, my understanding is Soviet doctrine was also very formulaic. So if you commit x forces to the defense, and they commit y forces in the attack, and you took z casualties, you could use that to work out the expected casualties for the opponent.

Which, would lead them to believe that they are inflicting horrendous casualties on the Ukrainians by committing these reserves to the front.

Wasn't that a one-time sale?

This article is discouraging. Europe is making big promises but the procurement process is very slow.

[Europe slow to sign military procurement contracts needed to supply Ukraine with weapons](https://www.intellinews.com/europe-slow-to-sign-military-procurement-contracts-needed-to-supply-ukraine-with-weapons-282069/)

The Ukrainian army was blasting through 180,000 artillery shell rounds per month, whereas before the war the US was producing only 14,500 shells per month, and EU about the same amount. Since the war started the US is now producing 20,000 rounds a month and has invested into new capacity that could increase that output to 90,000 rounds per month “eventually,” the Washington Post reports. 

Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu said the alliance was “continuing to work to rapidly address shortfalls in ammunition stockpiles, enhance interoperability and interchangeability and strengthen the transatlantic industrial base.” But little has been achieved. 

Lungescu claims that Nato allies like the US, UK, Norway and France have already signed large contracts, but declined to provide additional details when pressed by the Washington Post this week. 

That is going to make a difference on the battlefield. Russia made 1.7mn 155mm artillery shells a year – the vital workhorse ammo in the current conflict – before the war, but that will rise to 2.4mn by the end of this year, the New York Times recently reported. Germany’s biggest arms maker is struggling to increase its production to 450,000 rounds and Ukraine has already largely used up the stock of 1mn shells the US gifted it at the outbreak of hostilities.

Germany's Rheinmetall aims to increase annual output of artillery shells from 450,000 to 600,000 by expanding existing plants and integrating the takeover of Spanish company Expal Systems.

**The European Union has pledged to deliver 1mn rounds of 155mm artillery ammunition to Ukraine in the next year, with all shells being manufactured within the bloc.** In April, the European Commission introduced the Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP), a €500mn initiative aimed at boosting industrial production and replenishing member countries' ammunition stocks. A Defence Production Action Plan is also expected to be approved at a Nato meeting in Vilnius later this month.

However, despite all the breathless reports of Europe “scrambling” to make more money available, little has changed on the ground. **Large sums have been pledged but after 15 months of escalating warfare, not enough is actually being spent.**",False,1688873942.0,t3_14tt4cw,t1_jr8diwo,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Putin on the other hand maybe just doesn't have the resources to fight a civil war.  He could crush Prigozhin and Wagner, but it would mean pulling thousands of troops and equipment away from Ukraine -- which would probably result in a major front collapse.  Maybe there's a big risk that killing Prigozhin even now would escalate to a Wagner uprising, and Putin just can't afford that.

Edit: I’m not going to say Ukraine is going to lose. They aren’t. But we’ve seen this time and again. Britain in 1918 and 1945, despite winning, was exhausted and lost a lot. East Germany got into a richer nation… immediately had a brain drain. This happened with *lots* of Eastern Europe. Ukraine will win but the long term impacts on Ukraine will still be devasting- just like, again, Britain won in 45, but the mammoth costs haunted them for years and it cost them many colonies.",1688841460.0,1688822295.0,t3_14tt4cw,t1_jr5d318,,4,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Every western country has something similar.

From what I can tell, on the Battalion side, there has been a legitimate effort to clear out the Ukrainian version of Proud Boys. There seems to be pretty wide consensus that this effort is real, and has done a pretty good job. That seems worthy of some praise.

So…as far as I can tell…your assessment seems pretty good. The battalion has matured into something that can’t reasonably be called a nazi paramilitary.

I have difficulty with the place names so it's hard for me to follow the news. Is Ukraine making probing attacks that imply Donbas is a possible main target?

I wonder what would happen if Ukraine took back a significant part of Donbas. Would Putin press for piece to forestall losing more?

Ukraine's steadfast line is peace talks can only happen after rolling Russia back to the 2009 borders. I wonder, though, whether Ukraine would accept rolling back to 2014, with or without Crimea.

Everyone talks about how Russia cannot be trusted; they would just pause for a few years and attack Ukraine again.

If there *was* peace, though, then Ukraine could do that. Join NATO, get a lot more NATO equipment and training, get much of their population back so they can add military personnel -- and then Ukraine attacks Russia to drive Russia back to the 2009 borders.

If Ukraine is part of NATO, does that preclude them attacking Russia? I understand such an attack would be *Ukraine* attacking, and NATO would not send troops to the battle.

It's hard to tell since they're literally probing the whole line, they already liberated a village that was occupied since 2014. My personal guess is that their preferred outcome would be to cut the front in half (Zaporizhia Oblast)  and reach the Black Sea because then Russia would have difficulties holding and supplying anything South of it, including Crimea. But I could be wrong. I also think that Ukraine will still push anywhere, where there will be an opportunity. They have preferred aims, but their overall strategy will remain flexible to opportunities that offer themselves.

>I wonder what would happen if Ukraine took back a significant part of Donbas. Would Putin press for piece to forestall losing more?

The whole justification for the war Putin sold the Russian public was to defend the separatists in the Donbas, so losing it would be a huge blow.

It will be hard to get all the NATO members to accept Ukraine, while they still have territorial disputes. One veto from a NATO member is enough.  Also, once Ukraine makes an actual peace, they're literally accepting a new status quo, and restarting the war would make them look very bad, Western aid to Ukraine only is possible because the overwhelming majority of the population is in favor of that.

Integration with with GIS-Arta, Ukraine's fire-control network software is actually one of the reasons it took so long to deliver the PZH-2000 to Ukraine. The Germans translated all the UI elements to Ukrainian and wrote a bunch of software to make that work.

As for counter-battery fire, once again, manual calculations or older counter-battery radar systems took multiple incoming in order to generate a firing solution; some of the new stuff we've given them will cough up a target before the incoming shell hits the ground. Which means that sometimes (but definitely not always ) a price of western artillery can move out of the way of an incoming shell, and then stop, set up and do counter-battery fire before the adversary has moved.
