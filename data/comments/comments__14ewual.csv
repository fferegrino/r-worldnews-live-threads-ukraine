Both Ukraine's General Staff and Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a commander of joint forces in the country's south, said that Russian forces are on the defensive in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson directions, while the Armed Forces of Ukraine are advancing.

""In the Tavria sector, our army is systematically driving the enemy out of their positions and continues to advance. The successes of the Defense Forces are already noticeable,"" Tarnavskyi said in a Telegram post.

Within the last day in Tavria, a town in southern Ukraine, ""enemy losses in killed and wounded amounted to almost three companies. Ukraine destroyed and damaged 68 units of enemy military equipment,"" Tarnavskyi claimed.

The General Staff said Russian forces were unsuccessful in offensives in the village of Piatykhatky in the Zaporizhzhia region, while they also conducted air strikes in the areas of Preobrazhenka and Stopnohirsk in the Donetsk region.

In Bakhmut, Ukraine's acting Commander of the 3rd Assault Brigade Maksym Zhorin claimed that Russian troops were unsuccessfully attempting to regain some of their lost positions on the battlefield.

""The result — dead and wounded Russians,"" he said.

What Russia says: The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed on Wednesday that its forces attacked units of the Ukrainian army in the southeast of the country near the border of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions, destroying their equipment. 

On Belarus: Ukraine's military also noted that ""no signs of (the) formation of offensive groups were detected in Belarus"" near the border with Ukraine. 

""However, combat training and coordination of the Russian Armed Forces units before their deployment to the areas of combat operations in Ukraine are ongoing at the training grounds of the Republic of Belarus,"" the General Staff claimed. 

Belarus, one of Russia's staunchest allies since the invasion of Ukraine, made changes to its constitution renouncing its neutrality on Wednesday.""",False,1687381510.0,t3_14ewual,t3_14ewual,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

""Russia will boost the mass production of drones and increase their deployment to the battlefield, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday, during an address to graduates from Russia's military academies in the Kremlin.

""The improvement and production of counter-battery systems will continue, as well as the deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles and robotic strike systems to the troops, which have shown themselves well in combat conditions,"" Putin said. ""We will accelerate their mass production. It is necessary to provide this equipment to all military units, including squads, platoons, companies and battalions.""

Putin said in the course of what Russia calls euphemistically its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, ""the latest models of armored vehicles, attack missile and aviation systems, air defense and electronic warfare systems make a huge contribution to the solution of combat missions"" and that ""their production and improvement will certainly continue."" 

Some context: Earlier this month, a White House official said they believe that an attack drone manufacturing plant Russia is building with Iran’s help could be fully operational by early 2024.

On Tuesday, Moscow launched “another massive air attack” on Kyiv using Iran-made drones, Ukraine’s military said, marking the second time this month that Russia has used those drones against the capital.""",False,1687381056.0,t3_14ewual,t3_14ewual,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-21-23/index.html

""Russia will continue improving its armed forces based on the ""invaluable"" experience gained in its ""special military operation"" — a term Russian officials and leaders use to refer to the invasion — in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday.

""The most important task here is the development of the nuclear triad, which is a key guarantee of Russia's military security and global stability. Already about half of the units and formations of the Strategic Missile Forces are equipped with the latest Yars complexes,"" he said during an address to graduates from Russia's military academies in the Kremlin.

""The troops are being re-equipped with modern missile systems with a hypersonic avant-garde warhead. In the near future, the first launchers of the Sarmat complex with a new heavy missile will take up combat duty,"" he added.

Putin met with graduates of universities and academies of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Emergencies, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Protection Service, the Russian Guard, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Investigative Committee and the Federal Penitentiary Service, according to the Kremlin.

On Ukraine's counteroffensive: Putin told reporters that there is a ""certain lull"" in fighting, with no active offensive operations being carried out by Ukraine yet. He claimed Ukraine is suffering heavy losses on the battlefield.

CNN is not able to independently verify Putin's claims about Ukrainian loses or the course of the operations on the ground.

""But today we see that this (Ukraine's) offensive potential has not yet been exhausted, there are also reserves that the enemy is thinking about where and how to introduce,"" he said.""",False,1687381271.0,t3_14ewual,t3_14ewual,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Regiments in Yoshkar-Ola, Teykovo, Nizhny Tagil and Novosibirsk have been fully rearmed with the TEL version of ""Yars"" and rearmament of the Irkutsk missile regiments is to be complete until the end of 2019.

To my knowledge the reasons they aren't very popular or used much is because they have a small directed frag grenade blast to reduce collateral and short range as USA imagined using them in tight environments for their infantry against enemies in windows or similar targets which doesn't really jive with Ukraine wanting to field them from a great distance and who want as big of a blast as possible rather than less than a frag.

They are also fire and forget so harder to train on.

Supposedly the Switchblade 600 version has a Javelin warhead and might be a lot better for what Ukraine needs but I don't think they ever got sent (Edit: some got sent, very limited footage but there's footage of them doing work). Supposedly the Phoenix Ghost is a drone that's more adapted to what Ukraine needs but we haven't gotten to know really what it is precisely. Something tells me it has better range and can scout and return alive but that's just a guess as it was fielded very quickly.

USA's material support for Ukraine has long run into this issue. USA has procured a lot of their equipment based around air supremacy (and more recently like with the 300, fighting insurgents) so why have something like the Lancet when you can expect much more capable aircraft and larger drones to deliver fires?

Arguably one of the most positive aspects of evil capitalism is that no one can (directly) force you to buy anything. So, whenever someone buys something, presumably that person gets something that is valuable to them, otherwise they wouldn't have bought it.

So even if you have a company that sells something 100% made outside of Russia, takes the money and runs, the Russian (or Russian company) got something that is valuable to them, that's why they offered to buy it.

It's easy to see why that would be an advantage for Russia as a whole with something like an industrial machine they bought. Yes, they spend money on it but on the other hand, they now have a machine that allows them to produce things better/cheaper/faster.

It's a bit harder to see with consumer products, but even there is a value: Yes, a Russian who buys an iPhone doesn't really become more vastly more productive (arguably the opposite), but it will satisfy his very human need for this type of consumer product and will be less discontent with the government.

There are exception to this when the product is both desirable and destructive, like addictive substances, but that's extreme outliers.

In summary: If someone pays money for something, they had a reason to pay the money, so usually it benefits Russia in some fashion.

In defense of some (not all) of this questionable trade with Russia:

1. We don't have a full trade embargo yet, only sanctions.

2. It often takes a while to disentangle things, there are long-term contracts etc., though in the long run the squeeze on Russia will only get worse as contracts expire and sanctions are ramped up and made more airtight.

3. Smuggling and deception (e.g. shell companies) are always a thing. The goal here isn't to make it perfectly airtight (though we should strive to that as much as possible), but to make it more and more difficult for Russia. Smuggling operations, middle men etc. add cost and reduce quality and reliability. A good example of this is the 40% failure rate of chips smuggled into Russia from China recently:

* Russia at some point has started censoring word ""explosion"" in state-controlled media and replacing it with less alarming words, especially ""clap"" - ""хлопок"" in Russian. This has been happening even before the full-scale war.
* Russian word ""хлопок"" has two different meanings. If you make the last ""o"" stressed, it will mean a ""clap"". If you put the stress on the first ""o"", it will mean ""cotton"".
* Ukrainian language has different words for ""clap"" and ""cotton"".
* Neither Russian nor Ukrainian languages use accented letters to indicate stress, so you have to guess the meaning of a word by context.
* Almost every Ukrainian speaks or at least understands Russian due to the nature of Ukrainian demographics. On the contrary, Russians cannot easily speak or even understand Ukrainian. When conducting psyops on Ukrainians, Russians have to resort to using translation software which does not always understand context. That's how the word ""clap"" gets translated into Ukrainian ""cotton"".
* A Russian agent under the guise of a ""concerned Ukrainian citizen"" starts spreading anti-Ukrainian propaganda using translated stuff containing incorrectly translated words, which results in hilarious sentences like ""there has been a cotton near an X settlement"". That's how Ukrainians started calling explosions ""cotton"" and made a meme of it.

This is what some of the peripheral members of NATO do.  They hold stuff hostage in exchange for concessions, which is to say, money.

Erdogan picked a fight with Finland and Sweden right before an election to outrage the conservative Muslims in Turkey, energize his base.  (Maybe an American might be familiar with this tactic, of stoking outrage.)  Then he gave up his complaint with Finland.  Why?  Because once you do, Sweden's membership in NATO is completely irrelevant.

How, exactly, does Russia or anyone else invade Sweden without violating the territories of two or three other NATO states, states that would certainly invoke article 5?

Turkey's objection is probably going to quietly drop in 3 or 4 months once Turkey decides it's no longer OBVIOUS what they were up to.  Sweden's accession is a *fait accomplis*, and will probably only require a couple of billion dollars of sweetener delivered to Turkey and possibly Hungary.

Yes, yes, it's ridiculous NATO has to jump through hoops for these members.  But alliances are *defined* by their compromises.  If two countries had *EXACTLY THE SAME* interests, they'd be one fucking country to begin with.  (See: West & East Germany!)  Instead you have compromises, and nobody's ever super-happy with compromises.  *That's why they're called compromises.*

While i'm sure that ""we're lucky they are so fucking stupid"" is still the motto of the Russian army, I have been skeptical about the ""defensive lines"" theories for a while now.

When Ukraine performed ""defense in depth""(slowly giving up the entire Sierodonetsk, Lystansk, Popasna, Bakhmut area), It was clear how that tactic worked, more or less: Defend every part of the frontline, but be flexible and retreat if it becomes too hot. And, on the other hand, retreat early, and then use reinforcements&artillery to counterattack when Russia is not expecting it.

But none of that tactic made use of massive ""special extra defended"" lines.

---

On the other hand, for Russia, the reason all of reddit started going on about the 'defensive lines', is because there is satellite evidence of Russia preparing trenches, mines, and anti tank ditches, so we got some nice maps with red lines that look so much more important than the rest of the battlefield.

But it seems to me that any static defense, be it a quickly dug trenchline, a nice hideout in the forestline, or a far more expansive trench system+tank trench+mines - as long as it's static it's still weak to overwhelming force & artillery. Attacking it may be costly, but it's still going to fold eventually.

I suspect Russia knows it's not going to do all that much better defending at their static lines than they're doing now. retreating to those lines would simply mean giving Ukraine territory for free, while defense in depth calls for a defense at every town, every trench, every tree line. You don't just freely give those away and wait at the 'slightly better defended single line' over the 'three hundred tree lines' between there and here. It's just that Russia sucks at the ""retreating before it gets too hot"" and the ""counterattacking while they don't expect it"" parts of defense in depth.

But if Russia was just defending a strong line, Ukraine can focus on a section of the line with the whole of their forces. 

It seems to me that both approaches are bad options for Russia, and the reason for that is that the Russian army is worse than the Ukrainian army.

Russia's war has demonstrated vulnerabilities to all but the best Western air defense systems. Many of Iran's missiles are advance and have terminal phase guidance to avoid air defense systems. I don't doubt that most missiles would be intercepted, but even 10% getting through means disaster in Israel.

>Iran wouldn't be a functioning country in 3 days, let alone 3 months.

Wrong. If that were the case then the Taliban wouldn't be in control of Afghanistan. There's no effective way for the US/EU to depose the Iranian regime. It will literally never happen. You can kill the leaders, but they'll just replace them. All a war will do is encourage them to become more extreme.

>They wouldn't have the capability to develop, much less launch these weapons

Wrong. Iran is the size of Iraq and Afghanistan COMBINED. There's no way the US can effectively stop Iran's ballistic missile program outside of a total occupation of the country. That would be a very unpopular move, thus why it never happened in the first place.

>Iraq and Afghanistan were arguably most impressive military campaigns in modern history. I would take that comparison in a heartbeat

If you want the EU to get into a war with Iran and occupy their country, then why don't you advocate for that instead of hoping a US president does it? Ultimate that's what this discussion is about. McCain was another right wing warmonger that would have cost the US another $10-20 trillion trying to occupy Iran, ultimately failing to do anything meaningful besides cause mass death of innocents.

You vastly underestimate the Iranian missile program. Uzi Rubin, an Israeli and the foremost expert on the Iranian missile program, disagrees with you.

>US was on a nation building mission in Afghanistan

Afghanistan was a technological backwater that had been fighting a civil war for decades and had fought the Soviets for a decade prior to that. They had no effective army and were massively impoverished. It was trivial to invade and occupy Afghanistan. The hard part was always replacing their government with something better. That was a failure. It was a failure in Vietnam and it was also a failure in Iraq.

Iran is much more advanced than either Iraq or Afghanistan. No one's contesting that the US couldn't inflict a military defeat, but just like Russia can bomb the shit out of Kyiv early in the war, they didn't change the motivation of the Ukrainians to fight back. Same in Iran, you can bomb all the apartment buildings in Tehran but you'll only create a more determined enemy.

My argument is that a conflict with Iran would leave Israel, KSA and US forces in the Middle East bloodied and wouldn't change the regime of Iran, though it would likely encourage them to develop nukes.

This, in turn, is bad for the EU in general as it decreases their security and likely forces them to participate in the conflict. Which, itself, causes them to lose focus on Ukraine and Russian activity elsewhere.

>What Russia is doing in Ukraine would be daisies compared to what would be happening in Iran.
