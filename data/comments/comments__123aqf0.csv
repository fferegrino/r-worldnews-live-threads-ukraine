* Open source reports suggest that one USV was stopped by defensive booms, while two were destroyed in the harbour. Russian officials said that no Russian vessels had been damaged.  

* A previous USV attack on Sevastopol on 29 October 2022 reportedly damaged the minesweeper Ivan Golubets and the frigate Admiral Makarov.

Day 396-397 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a pretty quiet day, there were a couple reports of explosions in Kharkiv oblast, but none that we could hear from the city. Today Russians decided to do their next drone attack on our cities. Those have been happening quite often recently, the last one was less than a week ago.

Today’s attack started about 2 hours ago, at 10pm. We don’t know the exact scale of this attack yet, but it looks like they only targeted Kyiv and Dnipro this time. There was at least one confirmed hit somewhere in Kyiv, thankfully with no casualties, apparently, they hit a store. I’m not sure about the situation in Dnipro, but it looks like most drones were intercepted. We won’t know for sure until morning, so there’s no point in speculating about it.

Today Russians also tried to spread some fakes about us, but funnily enough the videos they posted were debunked by their own people almost immediately. They filmed a video where a “Ukrainian soldier” stops a “Russian speaking woman” on some road, insults her and then shoots the car she was in. All that being filmed on a dash cam, which are pretty much illegal right now for obvious reasons, so nobody here would use one. 

It was so amateurishly done that even Russians were immediately suspicious about it, and soon after it was geolocated to have been filmed deep inside Russian-occupied territory, behind Donetsk. Despite being debunked almost immediately, the [official Russian MFA account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mfa_russia/status/1640349416883204098) reposted that video anyway as a “proof of Ukrainians being Nazis”.

In this 35-minute call, both men who appear to be friends discuss the current affairs in Russia and slam Putin and Russian leadership, amply using curse words. 

This segment pieced together and translated by us contains the juiciest parts. In the rest of the call, men complain about sanctions, which affected both personally. 

While Mr. Prigozhin denied that this call happened and claimed it was a deepfake made using neural networks, he later commented by saying ""Let's start with the fact that there is such a thing as private life. People in a private conversation can talk about anything"", but stated he ""couldn't remember such a call happening.

The Russian audience does not appear as convinced, however - a poll ran by one prominent Russian separatist Oleg Tsaryov on Telegram showed 58% believed it was real, and only 13% thought it was a deep fake.

While the call is not informative by itself, if real, it could indicate the mood among some elites in Russia.

>##Military aid to Ukraine is being massively expanded
>#
>*Berlin wants to multiply spending on military aid to Ukraine in the coming years - from three to more than 15 billion euros today.*
>#
>The letter is four pages long, confidential and full of numbers.  No wonder, because it is an email from the Ministry of Finance to the Budget Committee of the Bundestag.  In it, FDP man Florian Toncar, Parliamentary State Secretary to Finance Minister Christian Lindner, politely asks parliamentarians for more money this Monday.
>#
>The message from the letter is that the Bundesregierung (federal government) wants to dramatically expand military aid to Ukraine in the coming years.  For this they needs the approval of the Budget Committee, but they will not refuse.  With the exception of the Linke and the AfD, there is a cross-party majority in the Bundestag on the question of supporting Ukraine.
>#
>So far in the current financial year, Berlin has set aside 2.2 billion euros for “upgrading partner states in the areas of security, defense and stabilization”.  The Ministry of Defense uses this money to pay for a large part of the arms deliveries to Ukraine, but also for the replacement of systems that were handed over from Bundeswehr stocks.
>#
>###The sum is to be doubled this year
>#
>This sum is to be more than doubled this year, by EUR 3.2 billion to more than EUR 5.4 billion.  This corresponds exactly to the sum that the Ministry of Defense had requested in consultation with the Federal Foreign Office.
>#
>But that's not all.  In the coming years, an additional 8.8 billion euros are to be made available for ""commitment authorizations"".  The Ministry of Defense can therefore conclude contracts for the corresponding amount.  So far, only one billion euros was planned for this.  All in all, the Ukraine aid will be increased from the current 3.2 billion to over 15 billion euros.
>#
>In a secret session tomorrow, Tuesday, the housekeepers of parliament are to find out what the additional money is to be used for Ukraine.  The massive increase in aid has surprised many of them, and in a positive way.
>#
>""Due to the high material losses of the Ukrainian armed forces, new supplies of material are necessary,"" the Ministry of Finance explains the additional need, ""for the needs-based, sustainable equipment of the Ukrainian armed forces, numerous procurement contracts must be concluded immediately, which also establish payment obligations for future financial years.""
>#
>It is about material ""in the areas of air defense, armored tracked vehicles, ammunition supply for the weapon systems supplied by Germany and artillery,"" says the letter to the budget committee.  After all, whoever supplies weapons ""fundamentally makes a follow-up obligation"" to keep these weapon systems operational in the future through ammunition, maintenance and services.
>#
>The additional expenditure is ""objectively unavoidable,"" writes the State Secretary, ""since without ongoing support for Ukraine, there is a serious risk that Ukraine will lose in its defensive struggle against the Russian aggressor, with unforeseeable consequences for the European peace order.""
>#
>The Ministry of Finance apparently does not want to finance the additional expenditure through a supplementary budget, but through flat-rate underspending in all departments and money that has been approved but not yet spent, such as “costs related to coping with the Covid 19 pandemic”.

Just held a meeting of the Stavka - for the first time on the road, in Dnipro.

Right here - in the strategic city of the center of our country, after visiting Marganets and Nikopol, Zaporizhzhia, the advanced positions of our soldiers in the Zaporizhzhia region.

The commanders of the operational directions reported the actual situation - General Syrskyi, General Tarnavskyi - they were there in person; those who lead the defense in Donetsk region, in the hottest directions. There were also online reports of OSUV commanders covering the south and the north.
There was a report of the Central Committee, the head of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Ministry of Education.

I want to thank the soldiers of our intelligence for the powerful work today in Bakhmut, the ""Kraken"" unit - as always, at its best. Well done, guys!

At Stavka, they discussed the general situation in the front-line areas, the strengthening and protection of our borders along the entire length of the front - from Kherson region to Kharkiv region.

Every commander understands that the enemy must be responsible for every attack on our cities and villages, on our people. For Slov'yansk, for Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka, for Avdiivka and Toretsk, for all the pain of Ukrainians - and not only during the full-scale war, but also since the 14th year.

Dnipro has been our fortress for more than 9 years, all this time supporting the front and soldiers. It is here, in the Dnipro, that since the 14th year thousands of our soldiers have been saved after being wounded. Dnipro concentrated the work of volunteers - from the first weeks of aggression in the 14th year.

Russian schools are witnessing a growing presence of Kalashnikov assault rifles, which find their place alongside blackboards and learning materials. As of September 2023, basic military training will be incorporated into the official Russian school curriculum. This shift has even extended to some kindergartens, where children are being taught how to properly assemble an assault rifle. Meanwhile, military-patriotic clubs are taking over spaces previously used for creative activities.

…As the director of the kindergarten in Uyar, Siberia, told the local newspaper:

“We work together with schools in the district and city, and as a result, members of Yunarmia [Youth Army] visited our kindergarten. The children enjoyed the visit <…> they were already familiar with the concept due to the preparation for the upcoming Defender of the Fatherland Day. The atmosphere was friendly, beautiful and festive, and overall the experience left a positive impression. Of course, the kids want to look like soldiers—fit and brave”.

The newspaper also interviewed a psychotherapist to reassure parents who may have had doubts about the need to teach a 5-year-old child to own a gun. “If the bearer of the weapon has a high degree of responsibility, it is safe for their mental state,” the therapist assured.

Article

""As far as possible military aid is concerned, resources are not inexhaustible. If we do not also invest in the defence industry, we will not be able to move forward, even in our own defence. Support to Ukraine is also being exhausted in terms of public support, probably the most in Slovakia,"" Čaputová said.

Slovakia has also repeatedly helped Kiev, which has been facing a Russian invasion for more than a year, with supplies of military hardware.

Misinformation undermines public support

Čaputová said most Slovaks remain in favour of accepting refugees from Ukraine, but most also think their lives have been made worse by the arrival of the refugees.

""Misinformation and misinterpretation are used to reduce public support for the steps we are taking as a country. Thanks to this, there is a growing gap between the decisions we make as a country and the attitudes of our citizens,"" said the Slovak President.

Čaputová said that the risk of losing social support for foreign policy in the country is growing. She said the future of Slovakia's foreign policy orientation in the context of September's snap parliamentary elections is probably the most important issue of its kind since the second half of the 1990s, when the country, unlike its neighbours, dropped out of the first wave of NATO enlargement.

The parties of the current pro-European and pro-Atlantic government of Prime Minister Eduard Heger could no longer muster the necessary majority in parliament, according to polls. On the contrary, support for Robert Fico's Direction is rising. According to a March poll by Focus, he would win the election with 17.6 % of the vote. Petr Pellegrini's Voice-Social Democracy party would get 17.1 percent of Slovaks to vote for it, dropping it to second place. After the formation of a new party, Prime Minister Eduard Heger's Democrats, the strongest ruling party, Igor Matovic's Ordinary People and Independent Personalities OLaNO (4.3 %), would find itself out of parliament. It won the last election with 25 %.

It's sabotage, thinks Fico

Last September, Heger's government lost its majority in parliament and in December MPs voted no confidence in the cabinet. Early parliamentary elections will be held in the country on 30 September 2023.

The donation of the fighter jets was unconstitutional because the government does not have the confidence of parliament said Robert Fico

There is no consensus among Slovak politicians on military support for Ukraine. This was also evident in the country's recent decision to hand over unused MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine.

Fico's party has already announced that it will file criminal charges against members of Prime Minister Eduard Heger's government for suspected abuse of public office, breach of duty in the management of foreign property and sabotage. Fico said this on Markíza television.

""It was unconstitutional because the government does not have the confidence of parliament,"" Fico said.

Slovakia has donated a total of 13 MiG-29 fighter jets to the neighbouring country, which is facing an attack by Russia, four of which have already flown to Ukraine.

I'd also point out much of Russia is still comprised of small Soviet industrial towns, much like the rust belt US only more so.

In general tank on tank combat has been rare in this war, and in this case that is a good thing since the leopard 1 was made with an emphasis on speed and mobility instead of armor.

write a speech Margrett Thatcher giving president Putin an ultimatum over the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine   
My dear friends,  
  
I stand before you today with a heavy heart, for we are facing a grave threat to the security and stability of our world. The recent escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, particularly with regards to the use of nuclear weapons, is a matter of deep concern and we cannot stand idly by.  
  
Mr. Putin, I have a message for you: if you continue down this dangerous path, the consequences will be severe. The use of nuclear weapons in any capacity is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The world will not allow you to disregard the principles of international law and use nuclear weapons as a tool of aggression.  
  
Let me be clear: the United Kingdom and our allies will respond with force and conviction if nuclear weapons are used in Ukraine. We have the capability and the will to respond in kind, and we will not hesitate to do so if necessary. You must understand that the use of nuclear weapons is not an option.  
  
Furthermore, we call upon you to immediately cease all hostile actions in Ukraine and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that nation. We urge you to engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully, and to work towards a solution that is acceptable to all parties.  
  
It is time for Russia to act responsibly and to uphold the principles of international law. We stand ready to work with you towards a peaceful resolution of this conflict, but make no mistake: the use of nuclear weapons will not be tolerated.  
  
In conclusion, let me reiterate: we will not stand by and watch as the principles of peace and stability are undermined by the reckless actions of a few. We will stand firm in defense of our values and our way of life. The use of nuclear weapons is not an option, and we call upon you to act responsibly and work towards a peaceful resolution of this conflict.

I really hope that a peaceful resolution can be reached soon, because the longer this conflict goes on, the worse it seems to get. It's like every day brings some new outrage, some new tragedy, and some new reason to worry about the future.

And honestly, I'm starting to feel like we're living in some sort of clown car of stupid. It's like the world is run by a bunch of bumbling clowns who keep making the same mistakes over and over again. It's frustrating, it's disheartening, and it's downright scary.

But even in the midst of all this craziness, there are still people out there who are working hard to make a positive difference. There are still communities coming together to support one another, and there are still small acts of kindness that remind us all of our shared humanity.

So as we continue to watch this drama unfold, let's remember that there is still hope for a better future. Let's keep fighting for peace, justice, and equality, and let's never give up on the dream of a world where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

Russians have been hitting their head against that ""city"", aided by a lot of artillery for pretty much a year now, still haven't captured completely, i think only like 60% of the city is in actual Russian hands after 1 year of fighting, and even if they had captured, probably wouldn't result in a major breakthrough.

So in short, artillery can be helpful in taking pieces of rubble, but it certainly isn't a quick process.",False,1679960011.0,t3_123aqf0,t1_jdxpsn3,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

I've worked a little with the military and malicious compliance is certainly something they do better than the private enterprise stuff I normally work with.

So I sort of wonder if the whole reason that ""general idea"" is handed down to the group leader who then interprets it and makes his/her decisions based on battlefield knowledge and then has a ""fist of god"" in the Sgt that can relate the idea in a manner to the troops which ensures malicious compliance has a personal retribution face right there across the room that will smight you mightily.

When I look at what went wrong for Russia in the Kharkiv counteroffensive a couple things jump out. Firstly Russia had far too few troops in the area so Ukraine could smash right through their lines, secondly there were virtually no premade defensive lines so once Ukraine broke through there was nothing to stop a total collapse and finally as the Russian lines collapsed the soldiers in the defensible cities broke and ran rather than waiting for relief and Ukraine was able to slaughter them in the retreat and then take the cities virtually uncontested.

Russia seems determined not to repeat those same mistakes and had they not declared mobilization and built more defensive lines they probably would be fighting in the suburbs of Sevastapol right about now.

The Russian authorities wanted to eliminate some of the inhabitants, some to repress or intimidate and to persuade the rest to cooperate.

The British Royal Defense Research Institute (RUSI) has released a major report on the war in Ukraine. It has five chapters: they are devoted to Russian preparation and planning, Ukrainian preparation and planning, the course of the fighting from February to July, an assessment of the actions of the Russian army, and the conclusions made by RUSI experts.

Here are some facts from the report regarding Russia’s preparations for war and the first days of the invasion.

What and how Russia wanted to achieve

Russia planned to invade Ukraine over a 10-day period and thereafter occupy the country to enable annexation by August 2022.
The Russian plan presupposed that speed, and the use of deception to keep Ukrainian forces away from Kyiv, could enable the rapid seizure of the capital.
Russia’s military build-up against Ukraine began in March 2021 when large numbers of conventional troops were added to existing forces along Ukraine’s borders.
In July 2021, the 9th Section of the 5th Service of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) was enlarged into a directorate and tasked with planning for the occupation of Ukraine. As part of this preparation, the FSB drew on extensive surveys carried out in Ukraine. These surveys painted a picture of a largely politically apathetic Ukrainian society that distrusted its leaders, was primarily concerned about the economy and thought an escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine was unlikely.
The Russian military leadership was also confident that it would defeat the UAF after more than a decade of modernisation.",False,1679936759.0,t3_123aqf0,t1_jdvah65,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes.

> In that case, the soldiers prosecuting that war are inherently aiding an illegal act.

No. This is not how it works.

First of all, an illegal war is a concept properly referred as ""crimes against peace"", but that concept as established during the Nuremberg trials did not survive to modern times (think of all the American presidents that would be criminals). So in practice, ""illegal war"" is just a figure of speech. In modern times, starting a war is not prosecuted, only acts committed during said war which constitute war crimes are.

When this war ends, your regular Ivan that was either conscripted or volunteered and fought in Ukraine will be free of any criminal liability. Those that gave, or followed orders that amounted to war crimes (such as those that dropped a bomb on the Mariupol theatre clearly marked ""children"") will be liable for those only.

In addition, crimes against humanity can likely be proven to some of them. The first one is already out in the form of the kidnapping of children, against Putin and his she-devil — and many people must had knowingly participated in that scheme, and others.

I think that the act of starting the war itself is unlikely to be punished. That would require resurrecting the concept of crimes against peace, and that I just cannot see. The Americans and Pentagon are already very uncomfortable with the possibility of actually prosecuting crimes of the war, and against humanity varieties. Imagine the panic that prosecuting the crime of starting a war would case. It is just not realistic with the current American-led world order — it depends on America being free to start military interventions whenever it pleases.

And even if you want to speak hypothetically, crimes against peace only refer to the ones who brought the war about, so in this case it would be Putin, some of his closest allies, and maybe Gerasimov. Not regular soldiers.

There is no legal concept of prosecuting soldiers for merely participating in a war. The German soldiers were not charged with just being members of the Wehrmacht, for example — those that participated in crimes did.",1679974503.0,1679974194.0,t3_123aqf0,t1_jdycmxd,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
