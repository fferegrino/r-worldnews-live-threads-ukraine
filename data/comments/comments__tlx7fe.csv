> 
> Lviv, Ukraine (CNN) — The first warm, sunny days of spring in the southern Mykolaiv region are ushering in a grim new reality: the smell of the dead.
> 
> As the frost melts and ground thaws, the bodies of Russian soldiers strewn across the landscape are becoming a problem.
> In his nightly video address on Saturday, Vitaly Kim, the region's governor, called on local residents to help collect the corpses and put them in bags, as temperatures rise to above freezing. ""We're not beasts, are we?"" he implored residents, who have already lost so many of their own in this war.
> 
> The governor has called for the bodies to be placed into refrigerators and sent back to Russia for identification through DNA testing. But, a month into the war, it is still unclear how or if the remains of soldiers are being repatriated to Russia, where reports about the death toll have largely been silenced. The country has cracked down on any information about the realities of the bloody war, restricting access to Western media reports, as well as the social networks Twitter and Facebook, in Russian territory.
> 
> Identifying dead Russian soldiers has been a difficult task. Andrusiv said only 30 have been found on the Telegram channel by their relatives, who scan through gruesome images of those killed in action for clues about whether their loved ones are alive or dead. Ukrainian forces send Andrusov images of deserted bodies, but they're often unrecognizable and have no documents on them.
> 
> ""It's very difficult to identify the dead because normally they don't have documents with them, normally the commanders take their documents and put them in some boxes. Normally they die in this fire, in shelling. And you cannot identify the metal 'dog tags,' where their number is written, it gives us no information about the person,"" Andrusiv said.
> 
> And as March turns to April, and temperatures climb to around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, the problem is getting worse.
> 
> ""The problem with Russian bodies is really huge. It's thousands of them. Before the war, the weather was cold, it was okay but now we have problems because Russians don't want to take the bodies,"" Andrusiv said. ""I actually don't know what we will do in the next weeks with their bodies.""

There have been several protests by Ukrainian civilians in the square where the building is located since Russian forces moved into Kherson.

The photographs show workers on a crane mounting the new flag.

>Putin cancelled the kleptocracy. He can no longer be its leader, he has disgraced himself before the whole world, which considers him a dangerous war criminal with signs of mental illness.

Yana is 10 years old and has fled the war in Ukraine.

She started school in the Polish capital Warsaw just three weeks ago and has already made a new best friend, Alicja.

There are already 60 Ukrainian refugee students in the school, and many more are expected to arrive.

Yana is just one of more than three million refugees who have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began a months ago.

Poland has borne the bulk of these migrants, welcoming nearly two million of them - half of whom are children.

France will also be providing magistrates, investigators and experts, ""to make sure the prosecutor can lead his investigation in the best possible conditions,"" according to the statement.

The ICC opened an investigation on March 2 into alleged crimes committed in the context of the situation in Ukraine since 21 November 2013, when hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians took to the streets of Kyiv to protest former President Viktor Yanukovych's U-turn over a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making.

Looks like Ukraine hit an Alligator class landing ship, hard.

The other nearby combat ships were seen moving away.

As a former USN Sailor this really hit home.  Job one is to help the damaged ship put it's fires out, not get out of harms way. We have recently seen that their Army and Airforce are incompetent, now we know their Navy is also incompetent. (if you are wondering why I think the Airforce is incompetent, it's because there are still long range mobile SAM's operating at will for Ukraine. A competent Airforce would *begin* by destroying those.)

I just can't fathom the Russian military training. To this day decades later I run towards danger, not away from it... thank you for that training, USN!

Edited: Some people don't understand why those ships should stay and help the injured ship. I don't have the words, I am inadequate for the task of explaining it.  I can only give the example when the USS Tripoli and USS Princeton were hit by mines. No one GTFO, disregarding the fact that the waters they were in were mined. Also the Princeton did a valiant job of repairs so it could help put out fires on Tripoli, after being hit by two mines they stayed in mined waters to do it. A third would likely have sunk them. I feel certain the idea of leaving the area never was spoken. We don't leave our fallen and injured behind is something drilled in early.

So why now? My guess is that he's looking at his legacy and has zero trust in the next person not to be weak or more friendly with the West. So even though the smartest thing (from Rus' perspective) is to let the conflict stay frozen for decades (and take little nibbles of land should they ever get closer to official memberships) he decided to go big right now.

She gave some inside about the whole russian nukes threat. According to her the threat with nukes is more the weapon than the nuke itself. Of course you can't rule out, that Russia could use a tactial nuke (which could destroy a small town or an urban quarter), but Putin could only play this card one time and if it still wouldn't break the ukrainian resistance/will (what she believes it won't), it would be over and the war would be lost for Russia. 
So she stated, that the threat with nukes is the real weapon for Russia and we shouldn't worry too much, because the fear is what Russia wants. So the worry shouldn't dictate our life and action.

Edit: Forgot to mention, that according to her, the threat with nukes is written down in the russian military doktrin and was often used before.

>[The] EU also wants to help Ukraine and at the same time **accuses Russia of deliberately trying to cause famine.**

>""I would point out that **Russia appears to be deliberately targeting and destroying Ukraine's food stocks and food storages,""** Valdis Dombrovskis, Commission vice-president said on Wednesday.

I guess this may get dismissed as “fearmongering,” but it appears that at best, Russia is accidentally damaging crops in certain areas, and at worst, Putin is planning on holding the crops in Ukraine hostage to force the West to lift the sanctions. 

But even if Russia doesn’t kamikaze themselves and much of the planet by dropping barrels of chemicals or whatever on high-yield farming targets in Ukraine, the damage is already done in all scenarios. Food exports in the region have taken a steep hit from the war, and many developing countries are very reliant on Ukraine and Russia for food, especially wheat. It’s pretty much an universally accepted fact that widespread famine is inevitable. 

The West is apparently looking to raise food production to rectify this, but it doesn’t really matter if they can somehow correct the food shortage before it stretches on for multiple seasons. The immediate effects from disrupting the food trade will still be too large to offset it, and the effects will ‘spill over’ in a variety of ways—including politically, on a domestic and international level. 

Side note: the byproduct effects of the food shortage could greatly negatively impact Ukraine and Russia, but if Trump or another Republican take over the US in 2024, especially if in part because of those byproduct effects, things will look even tougher for Ukraine but easier for Russia. 

In short, even if no nukes are deployed, Putin is deposed, and the war ends sooner than later, this is going to get much worse before it gets better.

#Severstal Is First Russian Firm to Run Out of Time to Pay Coupon

Thursday, March 24, 2022 11:14 AM 
By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --Severstal PJSC has become the first Russian company to run out of time to pay interest on foreign-currency debt since the war in Ukraine began after Citigroup Inc. blocked the transaction. It’s now at risk of creditors calling a default. 

Although flush with cash, the steelmaker was unable to settle a $12.6 million dollar-bond coupon within a five-business day grace period that ended on Wednesday. Severstal said it’s keen to pay, but Citigroup, acting as correspondent bank of the unit issuing the debt, is blocking the payment. A person familiar with the matter said Citigroup asked the company to get permission from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control before it could remit the cash. But neither the firm and its controlling shareholder isn’t sanctioned by the U.S.

“This is an extraordinary situation for us,” Chief Executive Officer Alexander Shevelev said in an emailed statement. “We continue consultations with partners and do our best to ensure that bondholders receive funds in accordance with the terms of the bond issue. I hope that this injustice will be resolved soon and the rights of bondholders will be respected.”

Two bondholders confirmed on Thursday that they hadn’t been paid.


Alexey Mordashov
While the firm itself does not appear on any sanctions list, majority shareholder Alexey Mordashov is on the European Union and U.K.’s sanctions lists, and in those jurisdictions, sanctions on individuals generally extend to all companies they own or control. Still, because he’s not included in any U.S. sanctions, Severstal didn’t preemptively apply for an OFAC permit, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday couldn’t comment on dealings with a company or individual the nation hasn’t sanctioned.

The notes are denominated in U.S. dollars. Citibank N.A. New York is the correspondent bank for the Luxembourg-based unit issuing the notes, while Citibank, N.A., London Branch is the paying agent and trustee of the notes, the company said in a statement.

The missed payment is an unwelcome milestone for investors and Russian corporates alike. Despite the many sanctions and new capital controls that companies have been navigating since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, most Russian companies have been settling their foreign-currency debts on time. Some, like Russian Railways, have been late in paying interest but eventually managed to wire funds to bondholders before the end of the grace period. For Severstal, the grace period on its so-called loan participation notes that mature in 2024 proved too short to resolve the issue Citigroup raised.

“Severstal has two options -- to obtain an OFAC license to make payments, and then the coupons will begin to pass again,” said Dmitry Dorofeev, portfolio manager at Alfa-Capital Asset Management, a Moscow-based bondholder. “If this fails, then formally there will be a default, further creation of a committee of creditors, hiring consultants and communication with the restructuring company. But it’s a long process.”

The company said in a separate statement on Wednesday it’s seeking to “liaise with the relevant authorities to pursue a broader solution in order to minimize unintended effects of the sanctions restrictions on the Noteholders.” It also encouraged bondholders to reach out to Citigroup to request it “to cooperate with the company in its efforts to obtain the licenses from the relevant authorities” to make the payments. 

The $800 million debt, which pays an annual rate of 3.15%, was issued by Severstal’s Luxembourg-based unit Steel Capital.",False,1648121334.0,t3_tlx7fe,t3_tlx7fe,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

> **It's after 1 a.m. on Thursday in Kyiv. Here's what you need to know**
> 
> From CNN staff
> 
> CNN teams on the ground witnessed a barrage of outgoing fire late Wednesday evening that occurred in northwest Kyiv.
> 
> Earlier on Wednesday, a senior US defense official told reporters that Ukrainian forces have pushed Russian forces back on the frontlines east of Kyiv.
> 
> Russian forces are about 55 kilometers (roughly 34 miles) away from Kyiv’s city center to the east, an increase of between 25 and 35 kilometers (roughly 15 to 22 miles) as compared to the same location yesterday, the official said.
> 
> To the northwest of Kyiv’s city center, Russian forces are “digging in, and they are establishing defensive positions,” the official said. They have not gotten any closer to Kyiv’s city center along this line, the official added. They remain 15-20 kilometers (9-12 miles) away from Kyiv’s city center to the northwest.
> 
> Here's more of the most recent headlines from the Ukraine-Russia conflict:
> 
> * Russian-proposed draft resolution on the Ukraine humanitarian situation fails to pass in UN Security Council: A Russian-proposed draft resolution on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine failed to pass in the United Nations Security Council Wednesday evening. Two countries voted in favor, zero countries voted against, and 13 countries, including the United States, abstained from the vote. Nine votes in favor were required for the resolution to pass. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke ahead of the vote, stating that Russia was once again trying to use the Security Council to “provide cover for its brutal actions.”
> 
> * Biden arrives in Brussels for high-stakes crisis talks: US President Joe Biden has arrived in Brussels for a set of emergency summits meant to address Russia's war in Ukraine. Air Force One landed at the Brussels airport at 9:03 p.m. local time after a roughly seven-hour flight from Washington. Biden is expected to be greeted by Belgium's prime minister at the airport. He begins intensive talks with NATO, the G7 and the European Union starting Thursday.
> 
> * NATO’s thoughts turn to chemical weapons on the eve of extraordinary summit: The day before NATO’S extraordinary summit takes place in Brussels, multiple sources have told CNN that a significant amount of time on Thursday will be spent discussing how the alliance should respond if Vladimir Putin uses chemical or biological weapons against Ukrainian citizens. Multiple officials, who spoke on the condition of total anonymity, agreed that while the official NATO position that it will not get directly involved in this war will remain, chemical weapons could be a game-changer as such an escalation would likely prompt the public in NATO nations to demand action.
> 
> * Russia to expel US diplomats and label American employees ""persona non grata"": Moscow announced it will expel US diplomats from Russia, according to a statement issued by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday. A senior diplomat from the US diplomatic mission in Moscow was handed a note on Wednesday with a list of expelled American diplomatic employees declared “persona non grata,” according to the statement. Persona non grata literally means “an unwelcome person.”
> 
> * Up to 15,000 Russians have been killed in ongoing Ukraine invasion, senior NATO military officials estimate: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in one month in the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, two senior NATO military officials said. The officials made the estimate during a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. The officials specified the range could be as low as 7,000 or as high as 15,000 in total Russian soldiers killed in the conflict so far. Their estimate is based on what Ukraine is telling them, what they know from Russia “intentionally or by mistake” and from “open source” information, one of the officials said.
> WHO reports 64 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine: The World Health Organization has confirmed 64 attacks on health facilities in Ukraine so far, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday. “WHO has now verified 64 attacks on health care since the start of the war, and we are in the process of verifying further attacks,” Tedros said in a media briefing. “Attacks on health must stop. Health systems, facilities, and health workers are not and should not, [ever] be a target,” he said.
> 
> * Bill to ban Russian oil sent to the US Senate: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sent a bill to ban importing Russian oil, natural gas, and coal to the US Senate, a source familiar tells CNN. The House passed the bill on March 9.

https://twitter.com/polijunkie_aus/status/1506477643528503298 <-- very long thread, but worth the read

> 🧵Prof Zhang Weiwei, one of China's most prominent international relations scholars, gave a talk on 21 Mar on Putin's ""strategic imperative""to invade Ukraine. It's a strange mix of conspiracy theories and paranoia. Highlights to follow...

Note: the author of the thread claims that Zhang gives lectures to the Politburo and is taken seriously by Beijing, so his views are quite possibly representative of the mainstream Chinese’s thinking on the war. 

Some translated quotes that stood out to me:

> ""Majority of people agree that America is the culprit behind the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. America expects the conflict will bring European capital investment back to America, weaken Russia, break up Europe and make it more reliant on the US""...

>""But Putin's insight is the US doesn't have the will or resources to fight a war with Russia, so after years of biding his time, he finally pretends to fall into Biden's trap and calls the US' bluff and actually launches the operation""...

And

> ""Putin's third goal is to fundamentally overthrow the existing world order of post cold war dominated by the US as the single super power, establish a multi-polar new world order, with Russia being an important polar""

And 

> Finally Prof Jin got to Russia’s role “Frankly speaking Russia bears some responsibility. The Russians are known for their hot temper” 

And

> “The significance of this crisis and impact to China and the world: **Ukraine is definitely the loser.** Russia win some lose some. EU lose some. America wins short term but lose long term""

Thursday, March 24, 2022 06:45 AM 
By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --China’s oil refiners are discreetly purchasing cheap Russian crude as the nation’s supply continues to seep into the market.

Unlike India’s state-run oil refiners, which have issued a number of tenders seeking to buy Russia’s flagship Urals crude among other grades, traders say China’s state processors are negotiating privately under the radar with sellers. The nation’s independent refiners are also quietly buying, according to traders who asked not to be identified as the information is confidential.

Most buyers are shunning Russian crude after its invasion of Ukraine, fearing damage to their reputation or falling foul of sanctions. China’s independent refiners, which account for a quarter of the nation’s processing capacity and are mainly based in Shandong province, bought some ESPO oil that’s loaded at Russia’s eastern port of Kozmino, according to traders.

The recent ESPO purchases by independent refiners, known as teapots, are for May-loading cargoes, and the Chinese processors are continuously making inquiries about Russian oil, traders said. ESPO is a favored grade because it can be shipped to their smaller ports -- that are unable to unload larger vessels -- from a shorter distance, cutting down costs. 

Some teapots are working with traders on financing options and checking on the availability of vessels to ship the crude at a reasonable price, and are also considering buying Urals, said traders. The cargoes of Urals purchased by state-run processors are for June delivery, they added.

Trading of Russian oil has mostly shifted away from the public eye after its invasion of Ukraine. Willing buyers and sellers are being forced to engage in private negotiations after some tenders attracted zero bids. Shell Plc got heavy criticism after its purchase of Urals not long after the war started.

Another of Russia’s Far East crude grades -- Sokol -- is also flowing to India. State-run Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. bought some Sokol loading in May from ONGC Videsh Ltd., an equity partner in the Sakhalin-I project, according to traders. Cargoes are loaded from the De-Kastri terminal.

Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and ONGC declined to comment.

Japan’s Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co. known as SODECO, which also has an equity interest in Sakhalin-I, declined to comment on its future exports of Sokol crude. Traders said some buyers in North Asia are likely to take their already-committed cargoes of the grade in May.

India has so far bought at least 13 million barrels of Urals since late February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with Indian Oil purchasing a further 3 million barrels in its latest tender. Volumes to the nation averaged about 128,000 tons a month in 2021, Bloomberg calculations based on ship-tracking data show.

1) I am a really left wing person but I said no more to left parties who equate Russian Imperialism and Western Imperialism... One is better for its own people and neighbouring countries than the other is

2) Russia only kept the authoritarian practices of the Soviet Union. Whoever doesn't see that (and there are a fair few of them on the left) is himself an authoritarian or, in the best case, a useful idiot. Yesterday, my uncle, a lifelong communist said that Ukraine is fighting for values that are not only Western but that are also the basic freedoms that Communism should protect. I wish many would understand that too. 

3) How lucky we are to live in our (still flawed) societies. We should never keep our guard down because democracy is like a plant. You have to keep it watered constantly and let it under the sun for it to stay alive and thrive.

4) stop chasing the extremes... I do want things to improve and I hate that there isn't a serious social Democratic party in my country (Italy) so you gotta pick your poison... But shifting the overton window isn't it, once extremists take over, they are hard to root out

5) Europeanism and the defense of commons ideals and culture of European peoples is what something that should politically defended above all else... I feel like this war makes me feel more similar to any citizen of the European Union, we are all in the same boat. Polish, Maltese, Cypriot, Irish, Swedish, ecc. We stand together. For this reason, we should look into expanding the European Union to all Democratic countries within the European Union... No matter if they suffer from issues like corruption. The EU has shown that it's capable of strong arming governments into fixing these problems like they did in Romania.

6) I feel compelled to visit Ukraine and help rebuild once this is over. Ukrainian people deserve and, above all, this war led me to know more and more about their culture, one of the most interesting amongst European peoples.",False,1648127903.0,t3_tlx7fe,t3_tlx7fe,,0,52,0,52,0,0,

[https://www.ft.com/content/857d2ccd-2853-43ba-b6b9-88e04b42ba93](https://www.ft.com/content/857d2ccd-2853-43ba-b6b9-88e04b42ba93)

The recent article by Maria Stepanova “The war of Putin’s imagination” (Life & Arts, FT Weekend, March 19) was exemplary. However, one jarring note was the unfounded notion that no one expected this aggression from the Kremlin.

I served as the UK’s defence attaché in Moscow for five years, 2011-2016, during which time this long, dark march to war was obvious, the path to conflict lit by the many pronouncements emanating from the dark red walls of Vladimir Putin’s palace.We reported the inevitability of conflict in detail, regularly and with the despair of Cassandra. One of the earliest reports opened with a line from Sherlock Holmes, whose statue stands outside the British Embassy wall: “There’s an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast.”

The evidence of Putin’s chosen path was never concealed. His many declarations were meant to be heard and understood: the colossal rearmament programme, the demand for more complex, more lethal weaponry; the militarisation of society; the distortion and seizure of the popular narrative; domination of education, the media and the courts to exclude contrasting views and, ultimately, the alienation and destruction of those among the Russian people who understood the folly of his declared ambition.

The list is remorseless, the consequences could not be ignored. But they were.It was not until I returned to the UK on the eve of our withdrawal from the EU, a manoeuvre which greatly emboldened those in Moscow, that I understood how our society had changed in the years I was serving overseas.All was subjugated to the City, all served the interests of our lucrative status as a safe haven for corrupt, and corrupting, wealth.

The values we were demanding of other nations had long since faded from our own actions.I despair at the decisions Putin has taken, but even more at the prospect of finding credible leadership at home in the UK among those who have compromised so long with his regime and the wealth it offered.

Thursday, March 24, 2022 05:49 PM 
By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --Germany and Italy were among countries which said any effort by Russian President Vladimir Putin to charge in rubles for gas would be a violation of their contracts. President Joe Biden called for removing Russia from the G-20.

Group of Seven leaders warned Putin against deploying biological, chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Earlier Thursday, NATO agreed to double the number of battle groups protecting its eastern border and prepare for Russia to potentially use such weapons in Ukraine.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance is sending more aid to Ukraine and equipment to help the country prepare for possible biological or nuclear incidents by Russia. He spoke in Brussels.

The heightened military readiness underscores the intense pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders gathered in Brussels for meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and the Group of Seven leading economies. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scolded NATO leaders for not responding to his plea for a no-fly zone over Ukraine and asked for more weapons for his military to fight off Russia’s invasion.

WWIII

I am often asked if I believe in the possibility of a full-fledged World War III when I am in Moscow. To be honest, right now - in the next 5-7-10 years - definitely not. And to my mind, there is one absolute obstacle to this, and it is insurmountable by neither the amount of money, nor the number of missiles, nor even the number of people involved.

In order to plan and implement a multi-front war using a general mobilization of the civilian population (and where else to get ~1-2 million soldiers, for example?) you need a very strong ideology, a living system in which the young people who go to die and kill really believe in what they are doing and that it is necessary. Think of Hitler or Mussolini - young emotional dictators promising an angry and humiliated youth victory and a better life. Young people had something to fight for-they did it for their future, thinking that their children would have a better life than they did.

Any authoritarian dictatorship that wages such a war on several fronts, with different countries and nations, prepares this ideological system for years; it must have its ""positive"" young leaders, its ""faces from the people,"" its symbols of struggle.

These people must be greatly humbled by the past, offended by the actions of the country they are invading. It is clear to me exactly what situations/incidents could have been used to ""prepare"" the Ukrainian war (and after all, the sentiment has been ""ripening"" for almost 30 years), but even the ideology of the Russian-Ukrainian is very, very weak, and the DICTATOR IS OLD.

His electorate, his main support are elderly former communists sitting on the couch in front of the TV. 
And these are guys who can write a denunciation against their neighbor for anti-Putin words, but not those people who can take up arms and go on a large-scale war against conditional Poland or the Baltics. 

And those who could do this, could go to war, have no reason at all to make such a decision and agree. There is no reason to believe that this power will bring a better life after winning the war. At least in the next 7-10 years the situation will not change.",False,1648122126.0,t3_tlx7fe,t3_tlx7fe,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

I'm starting to look at accounts more and there's a shitton that that are one to five years old. They start with a few karma submissions on random subs. Lay dormant and then exclusively post on /r/worldnews for the last 2 weeks or so.

Yours wasn't dormant for a long period of time. You have also had a variety of discussion in your initial phase, these have submissions to subs for link karma.

By Bloomberg News

(Bloomberg) --The U.S. is working with NATO to prepare for Russia potentially using biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine as the world’s leading developed nations plan to warn President Vladimir Putin against taking that path.

Speaking in a video feed to a NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scolded the alliance’s leaders for not responding to his plea for a no-fly zone over Ukraine and more weapons for his military to fight off Russia’s invasion. He warned that Russia’s neighbors, including members of the alliance, might be next. 

The speech underscored the intense pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders who gathered in Brussels on Thursday for meetings of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and the Group of Seven economies. NATO called on China not to support Putin’s war. 

The war has left Ukrainian cities in ruins and driven an estimated 10 million people from their homes. Ukraine has also killed a significant number of Putin’s troops, with NATO estimating the toll to be as high as 15,000.",False,1648129111.0,t3_tlx7fe,t3_tlx7fe,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

&#x200B;

We are still VERY far removed from a nuclear war. People think a puff of smoke touches Poland's border and countries will just start flinging nukes. Even a direct confrontation with NATO won't immediately lead to nukes, just that the chance of nuclear war goes from small decimal percentages to maybe 1% (of course that 1% is huge) 

&#x200B;

And a lot of the same repetitive language from redditors and bots like ""He's cornered and crazy"". Yeah he's paranoid but he's not that isolated lol a shit ton of countries are still buying his Oil and none of his actions seem crazy, just horrible and acting on bad information from his generals which he has punished. And even the intercepts that US intelligence has suggesting Russians want to avoid any conflict with NATO, that when Putin declared his threats US intelligence saw no movement otherwise and just view it saber rattling (US intelligence has been on it) and that they didn't shell Kyiv when the Nato ministers visited Kyiv.

I don't mean concerning in the sense they will do it. Just in the sense that these type of threats are being so casually exchanged so frequently lately as to mean nothing. 

It doesn't strike me as the good ol cold war threats that kept stability in the 1950s thru 2021 through MAD. This feels different.

3 - we are hearing unprecedented allusions to and discussion of nuclear war from our world leaders. It is new, it is still very fresh, it is objectively a frightening thought.

4. Points 2 and 3 make it expectable, reasonable even, to worry about the possibility of nuclear war.

Just think about these scenarios that Russia would have achieved if they were competent enough.

Putin wanted a Trump 2nd term even if it meant overthrowing the government on Jan 6th. The only reason jan 6th failed was because the Qanon crowd got in the way of the oath keepers who planned on taking the capitol by force. Derailed because of their own conspiracy they created.

https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/oath-keepers-indictment-shows-insurrectionists-were-expecting-armed-second-wave-130884165716

Trump mentioned war with Mexico which is run by Russian asset AMLO and Putin tried to give cartels (Russian mob aligned since the 90s) missiles to shoot down US aircraft in 2018. Putin would have fabricated a phony war. A Vietnam situation right next door that would have humiliated the US trying to control areas Mexico couldn't even control with US help. Derailed when the plan was uncovered and Trump lost.

https://www.newsweek.com/mexican-drug-cartels-asked-russia-arms-dealers-help-shooting-down-us-1234167

The world might have seen a collapse of American democracy, influence, and a phony war with even higher death tolls due to how dense North American cities are if Russia was competent.

“Stocks rally in Moscow as trading resumes

The Moscow stock exchange has opened higher, as trading finally resumes after a near month-long suspension.

The MOEX index rallied as much as 11% in early trading, suggesting that measures put in place to prop up stocks are working. Its the first session since the exchange was shuttered on February 25th following the invasion of Ukraine.

Energy firms are leading the rally, with gas giant Gazprom surging 18% and oil group Rosneft gaining 20%.

2a. Air only 

2b. Pushing Russia out 

2c. Attacking Russia.

3. Doing nothing.

> BRUSSELS — The U.S. announced a package of new sanctions against Russia and further aid for Ukrainian refugees as President Joe Biden looked to rally the leaders of some of the world’s most powerful democracies to increase their efforts to aid Ukraine in a series of high-stakes meetings.
> 
> The U.S. said it would place additional sanctions on more than 400 Russians and Russian entities, including the Duma and more than 300 of its members, along with more than 40 defense companies, said a senior administration official. It also plans to take additional steps to prevent Russia from attempting to prop up its economy.
> 
> The White House also announced it would allow as many as 100,000 Ukrainians to enter the U.S., with a focus on those who are most vulnerable. The administration is also prepared to offer more than $1 billion in additional funding towards humanitarian assistance and $11 billion over the next five years to address food security threats after the disruptions to the Russian and Ukrainian agricultural industry.
> 
> The additional efforts come as senior administration officials say Biden is trying to raise pressure on other nations to increase their support to Ukraine as he himself has been under pressure himself at home to do more as he attends a series of summits Thursday.

Summer 2021 NATO reaffirms Ukraine will move towards a MAP 

To compound these, leadership in the US is working towards withdrawing troops from abroad and faces very low approval ratings. If leadership changes in 2024, the risk of direct US-Russian engagement is elevated. 

Putin has been planning this for at least a decade. Look at the bullion Russia has amassed to help offset hyperinflation from predicted sanctions. This was not done on a whim- Putin saw his window closing and probably decided it was now or never. Once Ukraine is granted a MAP, stakes are raised. Once they eventually join NATO, mission impossible.

Prior to the war, Ukraine had dammed the Dnieper river, denying over 80% of normal freshwater to Crimea. So Putin was face with the real possibility that they would have to surrender Crimea back to Ukraine before they died of thirst.

Now, why not nibble and take out the dam, you might ask? See the map of Ukraine. The Dnieper flows north to south. So if you took out the dam and seize  the territory around it, the Ukrainians could easily just dam even further upriver, and you would be back to square one.

So the only choice is to take the entire river. Except the Dnieper bisects Ukraine and flows right past Kyiv. So to control the Dnieper, you have to take half of Ukraine... which is precisely what Russia tried to do in an all out offensive/blitzkrieg.

Here's a decent article on the water situation: https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2017/1/4/dam-leaves-crimea-population-in-chronic-water-shortage

So in short, it was attack now and go for a complete victory, or face a slow painful retreat.

> 
> A Russian soldier drove a tank over his commanding officer to protest the huge number of losses suffered by his unit in Ukraine, a Ukrainian journalist has claimed.
> 
> The claim followed footage allegedly showing Russian Colonel Yuri Medvedev being stretchered into a hospital after suffering severe injuries to his legs.
> 
> According to Roman Tsymbaliuk, who was said to have been the last Ukrainian journalist in Russia before fleeing the country in January, Medvedev was run over by one of his own soldiers who was angered by heavy losses suffered by the unit.
> 
> Tsymbaliuk said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the tank battalion of 1,500 troops had lost around half its strength to either death or injury.
> 
> 'A soldier, choosing a convenient moment during the battle, ran over his brigade commander, Colonel Yuri Medvedev, with a tank, injuring both his legs,' Tsimbalyuk wrote in his report to his followers.
> 
> 'Medvedev is in a hospital in Belarus and has already been awarded the Order of Courage.' He said the Colonel is now awaiting compensation.

German leaders made a decision to entwine themselves with the Russian dictator, under the pretense of a mutually beneficial relationship. The implication however, is that it ties both nations together, and when one is ruled by a dictator that does things like commit mass murder and try to erase a people’s identity and nation, it makes Germany party to those things.

Shutting down Nordstream 2 is not some Grand overture, *it is quite literally very least they could do*, and increased spending isn’t to the benefit of Ukraine, it is to the benefit of *Germany*, yet *another* thing that Germany’s allies and people within Germany itself have been pleading for for a very long time.

The things you mentioned are not things that help Ukraine, they are things that help Germany, and add to this the apparent refusal or reluctance in sending equipment and weapons to Ukraine, and it paints a very dark picture for a nation that less than a century ago embarked on a European mass murder escapade with another Russian dictator.

I don't particularly respect sanctions in general, they can take months or years to show any affect and they are usually things that can be worked around.

I agree that Europe, particularly Germany and a few others can't really just turn off the gas, without inflicting a lot of pain on themselves.  This does however need to be constantly drummed and not dropped after this conflict.

Though I wonder, would they turn off the gas if NATO was attacked?  Or would they still attempt to trade with an enemy they were at war with?

I don't give them much credit for stopping a non-existent pipeline, I don't give them much credit for promising to adequately spend on defense, since they did that when they joined NATO and still never delivered.  I don't give them much credit for realizing only now, that they've not developed their energy infrastructure properly.

So I borrow, say, 100 of your stocks for a month. In a month I have to give you those 100 stocks back, and also a few bucks for your trouble. Doesn't even matter what the stock price is, you get your stocks back plus the fee for borrowing them.

Ok, so you give me those 100 stocks and we sign a deal that you get them back in a month. I think those stocks are gonna go down, so I sell them all right now, for 10 bucks each, and put the 1000 bucks in my pocket. 29 day pass and the price of acme is now 9 bucks, and I have to give you your stocks back. So I go buy 100 stocks, but now it only costs me $900 bucks. So I buy em, give them back to you plus your fee, and keep the extra 100 bucks I made (minus the fee). 

(The risk, the ""bet"" here, is that if the stocks cost $11 now, now I have to put out $100 of my own money to buy the stocks back). The owner of the Acme stocks doesn't care that I have to pay that money out, that's my problem.

The US absolutely has dominated the post-Cold War period and has worked to empower institutions that work to maintain that dominance (like international banking structures, global corporatism, and their own military adventurism) often at the expense of the post-WWII institutions where China and Russia have more control (like the UN Security Council).  This is no different than any other nation's attempts to angle the world's power levers in their favor.  Putin is trying to shake up that status quo in the hopes that whatever shakes out will be better for him than how it was before.  He's desperate and his desperation is warranted.

China has their own leverage and plans for the future that don't necessarily completely conflict with Americans' on a fundamental level, but Russia has no backup plan.  Their economic power falls away like shed skin if the rest of the world seriously aims at carbon neutrality.  All they have left is nuclear weapons (and theoretically a sizeable traditional military) to keep a seat at the big boy table.  Proving the awesome might of that military *could have* helped them roll into an ascendancy in the new world order, whatever that looks like.

Where the analysis falls apart is in the conclusion.  Maybe the next fifty years is decided by big world powers flexing their military, but Russia just proved they can't do that.  Maybe it's decided by lunatics threatening to obliterate each other with nuclear weapons as they gobble up non-nuclear states, but Russia just proved they can't do that, either.  At least not easily.

China is a world power (and they kind of have been by virtue of their Security Council veto alone for a long time).  They're increasingly going to be a world power for the foreseeable future and quite potentially eclipse the US as the preeminent world power in terms of world-history-movers-and-shakers.

Budget isn't really an issue.  The political will exists to authorize whatever spending is needed to make up for it.  


Production on the other hand is a different matter.  Let's take the Javelin missile for example.  It's made by 2 companies in the US, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.  It's been being produced since 1996.  In all that time about 45k have been made.  That means in the past 6 weeks or so something like 20% of all Javelins ever made have either been sent to Ukraine or committed to them.  It's unlikely that these two companies can simply just ramp up production to keep inventory around the world at it's previous level and it will probably take years to restock them unless they expand their Javelin production abilities.  That however I think is likely because countries have seen what a devastating weapon it is against a larger force.

As for me, I am in Kyiv (not Kharkiv), we have relatively normal situation (if you compare us to Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and cities in Kyiv region as Bucha and Borodyanka) despite the fact everyday there is a new air attack from russians.

There were 2 rockets or missiles, idk, in my neighborhood the other week. Big apartment building next to mine were hitted, but thanks god nobody died that morning. It looks like 1 floor was destroyed completely, the fire started immediately. I have never ever seen anything like that in my whole life.

> Kyiv, Ukraine (CNN) - The roar of a fighter jet engine forces Andriy into silence.
> 
> As he waits for the aircraft to take off, the Ukrainian fighter pilot's flight mask covers half his face, hiding his identity, but his squinting eyes still reveal a jovial smile. ""Yes, that's ours,"" he says.
> 
> Nowhere in the military match-up between Russia and Ukraine are the scales more tilted than in the air, where Moscow has more advanced aircraft and in much larger numbers. But nearly four weeks into the war, the Ukrainian Air Force is still flying and roaring, like the jet that delayed Andriy's interview with CNN.
> 
> And Andriy says conditions have been shifting in favor of him and his cohorts.
> 
> ""Now the situation is getting calmer,"" Andriy says. ""In the beginning they were succeeding due to their quantity, but now the situation is getting better.
> 
> ""Many Russian pilots refuse to fight, because we are shooting them down,"" he claims.
> 
> Andriy agreed to speak to us under the condition that his full identity, rank and location -- information that could help the Russian military target him -- are not revealed. He flies Russian-made Su-27 jets.
> 
> ""I provide back up and cover for the aviation that is working at covering the ground. I focus on destroying missiles and enemy aviation, like air to air,"" he explained. ""I can't tell you how many, but I've shot down Russian jets.""
> 
> So far, he and his fellow airmen have been able to hold off Russia's apparent superiority with careful planning and cunning tactics. Andriy doesn't go into detail about what those strategies entail, but says they involve close coordination with other Ukrainian forces, and taking some extreme risks.
> 
> ""Russian pilots fly more modern jets and they are capable of firing missiles at much further distances,"" he said. ""For example, in order for us to deter missiles that are fired at 80 kilometers distance, we have to approach them at 40 kilometers. If they've already fired a missile at us, we somehow have to have it intercepted along the way.""
> 
> **""Sometimes two of our pilots fight against 10 planes,"" Ignat said.** ""They take off with a one-way ticket, they understand that perhaps they are going to die.""

1) Zelensky is talking about Ukraine's suitability to join NATO in terms of military professionalism, capability, resolve, will etc. In other words, if Ukraine joins NATO will they be an asset or liability. (note: NATO might accept in either case, but prefers assets).

2) The integration with NATO forces means a lot of things, but it's going to mean actual electronic technical integration. Expensive smart military tools that talk to each other to exchange targeting and situational information. This isn't given out lightly, and nobody outside of NATO should have it. Ukraine has not been given any of these things - like integrated air defense, integrated attack aircraft, integrated battle tanks and armored vehicles, AWACS, etc. But this isn't what Zelensky is talking about. What he has effectively demonstrated, however, is that **Ukraine could be trusted** with this equipment.

I think the overall point is, if you think about what Ukraine's military looked like in 2014 and compare it to now - it's clear that Ukraine's fighting forces operate with the modern system now.

People here don't like to hear it, but this will entail Ukraine recognizing Donbass and Crimea, best case scenario only Crimea.

>	The four women spoke to MPs on Thursday after being given special dispensation from the Ukrainian government to travel to the UK.

>Lesia Vasylenko, Alona Shkrum, Maria Mezentseva and Olena Khomenko held a briefing with MPs and journalists, where they revealed how vulnerable Ukrainians are being treated.


>Ms Vasylenko explained: “When Putin was unable to take Ukraine and Kyiv in the three days as he envisaged that he would, he shifted his strategy to target specifically women and children.

>PHOTO 
>Four Ukrainian MPs: Olena Khomenko (left), Lesia Vasylenko (centre-left), Alona Shkrum (centre-right) and Maria Mezentseva arrive at Downing Street, central London for talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

>“We have reports now through Ukraine, especially in cities which were hit the hardest, of women who were raped.

>“These women are usually the ones who are unable to get out. We are talking about senior citizens.

>“Most of these women, we have reports they have either been executed after the crime of rape or they have taken their own lives.”

>Ms Mezentseva said humanitarian aid organisations were struggling to access Ukraine and didn’t have a “presence”.

>She said: “There’s a mandate of those organisations which are receiving funds from the member states to be conducting operations on the ground.

>“It feels really disgusting to be left on your own when we are defending international presence and we’re saying there will be a day where they are being attacked.”

Russia never really had a liberalizing period induced by prosperity and widespread (by previous standards) literacy rates where human rights and conscience became a consideration in governance or any of the growing pains the West saw with the various liberal revolutions, transitions from absolute, autocratic monarchies to constitutional monarchies with royalty as figurehead or republics with various degrees of checks and balances in government.

Russia effectively went from agrarian serfdom (slave economy really) to industrial dictatorship, where the workers were still effectively serfs but showed technical prowess, to a decaying kleptocracy where plutocrats and oligarchs rule in ways that rival the inpetitude of Tsar Nicholas II.

There was never any true liberalization or democraticizing of their country. And Russia was notorious, even as far back as the Enlightenment as essentially a backwater stuck in the Middle Ages that depending on the Tsar/Tsarina either rejected or poorly aped the West and that displeasing the Tsar in any form, even a simple: ""No, I can't do that this second"" was a quick way to end up dead.

You are misinformed. There's been multiple aid packages, that is just one of them.

- 3/12 - $200m - https://www.state.gov/200-million-in-new-security-assistance-for-ukraine/

- 3/14 - $800m (on top of the prior $200m) - https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/16/fact-sheet-on-u-s-security-assistance-for-ukraine/

- 3/15 - $13.6 **billion** more. Roughly $3b of that is for new weaponry for Ukraine, roughly $7b of that is for humanitarian aid to Ukraine/Ukrainian refugees, the remaining balance is mostly US military deployments (in NATO, not Ukraine) + intel operations/medical assistance.

cc5a1fc3a101e16ba868bba1e3fe578e,tlx7fe,i1wxykr,"Yes, short selling can have a huge impact if done en masse. Short selling is a common thing that happens on the everyday market. It can be hard to predict when a stock will downturn so there will always be risk. If the stock goes up instead of down you will lose money and be forced to pay the difference. Unlike buying a stock outright, short sellers have a limited amount of time to sell back their borrowed stock. So when a short seller makes that bet against a stock they really need to be sure that the stock will fall. It's very much a high risk, high reward system.

Now take the Russian Market. After the sanctions the market fucking tanked. Russia closing the market after such a huge loss isn't uncommon for a market. Stocks are often frozen whenever there's a big upturn or downturn to prevent an artificial deflation/inflation from all the people jumping on board to ride the wave as it where. Usually after they reopen the stock it's supposed to stabilize. However with the sanctions, there's no reason to think the market should stabilize. The market has been closed for a month which is unheard of.

So to prevent a panic selling, and people profiting off a potentially plummeting market that reopened, Putin banned short selling. If a ton of people started short selling the stock of companies affected by Sanctions, it would have an enormous impact on the Russian market as a whole. It would pretty much cause everything to devalue on the Russian market which would send the country into an economic depression.

What Putin did won't stop that though. He's delaying the inevitable. Most likely hoping to either end the sanctions before he has to fully reopen the market, or find an alternative source of income through countries like China and India to keep the market stabilized.

When burning, white phosphorus will steal oxygen from other compounds, including water, soil, or flesh, and continue to burn until there is no oxygen available to it.  If you touch or inhale a particle of burning white phosphorus, it will burn  viscously.  

Consequently, use against people is considered a war crime. 

However, these chemicals have other non-antipersonnel properties which make white phosphorous very useful in things like tracers and flares. Burning in air it generates blinding light and a lot of heat, so can be used as countermeasure for heat-seeking / ir guided missiles, or vision-guided systems.  They also make excellent smoke generators because combustion generates a fine mist of very white particles.  And unless ignited, they are very stable. 

Ultimately, like many other chemicals, white phosphorus has military and benign uses.  And even some of the military uses are legitimate, whereas others are indeed war crimes.

The land based missiles need to be fueled before launch. With controller switches, pumps, and infrastructure required to store and pump liquid rocket fuel. There also needs to be lines of communication throughout the chain of command. These can also be disrupted, distorted, or outright blocked. 

Countries have various detection methods and warning signs. If a bunch of liquid rocket fuel is gassing off at facilities or a large amount of activity spurs up in an area these also become hot zones and could receive more targeted cyber attacks. 

Also, there was tech back in the early 2000s I saw on like a Discovery channel type show. It was a missile that when it flew over a target it would disable all electronics within the target zone. This was tech shown casually on a cable tv show 22 years ago.

NATO aren't exactly good guys. They're not currently invading anybody's country right now, so they're maybe the lesser of two evils, but that's not the same thing. As for 'pro USSR rallies', I seriously doubt it; Corbyn's occasionally been linked with the Trotskyite Militant (in that he wrote some articles that appeared in their newspaper in the 1980s), but those guys hate the USSR more than anyone. If there was any real 'pro-USSR' opinions of Jeremy Corbyn beyond merely being left-wing in the 1980s, you can bet the press would have used it. They didn't.

> lets hang out with jew haters.

Not really. The internal Labour Party report on the affair, which Keir Starmer has been suppressing, makes it clear that it was the *anti-Corbyn* faction in the Labour Party that was hampering the Party's crackdown on anti-semitism. Because they were happy to see Corbyn getting blamed for what they were doing.

> Boris is also probably the most liberal tory leader in years

Not saying much of anything, even if true, since all the Tories since Heath have been vicious shitebags. He's also a demonstrable racist, demonstrably corrupt, and he's put serially-corrupt, treacherous, immigrant-hating, worker-hating scumbags like Priti Patel into major cabinet positions. Less of a 'liberal' and more of an 'unprincipled opportunist', really. 

> Which thankfully the uk electorate doesn’t as many of us are old enough to know better.

I didn't call the Tories 'Nazis', but then I'm not some dipshit boomer falling for the 'Jeremy Corbyn is an antisemite' smear campaign either. If you're going to sneer at people on the basis of their ages, it's currently the over sixties - the Brexiteers and Trump voters - who are currently the most politically idiotic faction of society, by a long chalk. I AM old enough to remember the surreptitious anti-semitic murmurings of the pro-Heseltine Tories during the Westland affair - and multiple journalists coming out in print complaining that their sources were briefing them with extreme hate speech aimed at Leon Brittan - but back then it was just Tories being Tories. I imagine if the same thing happened today, it would still be 'Tories being Tories', the same way BoJo's multiple dalliances with saying and publishing overt racism get laughed off, while Jeremy Corbyn speaking at a rally where some numpty in the crowd once waved a Hamas placard gets dredged up at every opportunity.",1648143050.0,1648142807.0,t3_tlx7fe,t1_i1y6rb3,,3,-1,0,-1,0,0,

These are actually rational strategies because it gives them advantages with little downside unless the west is willing to adjust how they approach these situations.

The old strategy is steeped in what worked prior to 2000 but since then we’ve seen some massive failures of this kind of more global integration with countries that are bad faith actors.  We can’t expect them to give up their increasing levels of power automatically, and the people certainly aren’t rising up when their living standards are increasing steadily.  So we’re basically funding the expansion of bad actors in many cases.  I think it’s a flawed globalist ideology that allows developing nations with authoritarian tendencies to take advantage of the goodwill of democratic and westernized economies.  

Instead of having real punishments for this kind of behavior the west has just doubled down, like even more prosperity will make autocracy go away.  It’s a pipe dream.  Until someone sees this strategy fail miserably it’ll continue to be a model for developing economies:  Authoritarian.  Military expansionist.  Unbalanced trade deals.  Subsidized industry through favorable debt and inhumane labor policies.  Imported environmental destruction.

Yes, the US government actively encourages democracy movements in lots of authoritarian countries, sometimes subtly and sometimes very overtly.  The State Department directly comments on the legitimacy of elections in those countries, for example.

But American and European media pervades the whole world and shapes the expectations of people in nearly every country, American companies create social media structures that empower people's movements.

What has been interesting to me is the juxtaposition of [Ukranian advisor Arestovich staunch insistence on joining NATO as being mandatory](https://youtu.be/1xNHmHpERH8?t=407) and Zelensky's recent apparent softening of that stance. I think there is some real genuine dissonance here.

Given how resolute this guy was in 2019 about this process and given how this stance has apparently softened or evolved in some way - I see two outcomes:

1) Ukraine ends this war with a negotiated peace, and agrees to not join NATO (with a time limit or not, I don't think it matters). And then in the future it just reneges on this point and joins NATO anyway. After all, a bunch of failed assurances are what got us into this mess.

or

2) Ukraine ends this in a negotiated peace, and agrees not to join NATO. They do this because they realize that NATO is a sort of poison pill boogieman to Russia, and that the core purpose of NATO is to link up nuclear MAD and a collection of conventional forces with tripwires and treaties to try and shield countries from aggression. Ukraine has kind of demonstrated, so far, that the nuclear MAD part of this isn't actually the key element it's supposed to be. If they could get a defensive alliance with a different name with different guarantors but still get the weapons and alliances they need but without the all-important acronym NATO, Ukraine could be happy with that outcome. The fact that NATO is bolstering its support and resolve internally makes this easier too, because there are more weapons systems to go around which no longer have to come from the nuclear powers behind NATO directly.

We will see. It's still deeply interesting to consider how resolute the above speaker is in 2019 about exactly what this process is.",False,1648144118.0,t3_tlx7fe,t1_i1yf1dz,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

dde2548a6f1e377a8c207111993afbe7,tlx7fe,i1wz19n,"> The Russian military has 900,000 active duty troops and 2 million reservists.

Those numbers include approximately 150,000 Navy, 160,000 Aerospace Forces, 70,000 Strategic Rocket Forces, 100,000 support personnel plus 200,000-250,000 Rosgvardia gendarmes according to the CIA World Factbook. Relevant numbers for this campaign are Ground Troops (~300,000), VDV (~40,000) and Naval Infantry (~12,000) - the rest would be doing supporting roles at best.

Furthermore, the Institute for the Study of War [states the following](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/explainer-russian-conscription-reserve-and-mobilization):

> The Russian reserve has over two million former conscripts and contract servicemen on paper, but few are actively trained or prepared for war. Historically, only 10 percent of reservists receive refresher training after completing their initial term of service. Russia lacks the administrative and financial capacity to train reservists on an ongoing basis. According to a 2019 RAND analysis, Russia only had 4,000 to 5,000 troops in what would be considered an active reserve in the Western sense, meaning soldiers attending regular monthly and annual training. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has repeatedly stated that the Russian Armed Forces hoped to have 80,000-100,000 active reserve members.

> [...]

> Russia is likely rapidly exhausting the manpower it can readily use to generate additional effective combat power even as its forces lose combat effectiveness in Ukraine amid high losses. Russian efforts to mobilize more manpower can bring more people into Russian combat units, but those people are unlikely to be well-enough trained or motivated to generate large amounts of new combat power.

> Mobilization efforts are likely to start producing diminishing returns as Russia moves through the categories of fully-trained and recently-released reservists into categories of people further removed from their initial military experiences and/or those who will undergo hasty training before deployment to the front lines. Individual replacements for battlefield losses are unlikely to have the same training as their predecessors, and new units or those reinforced by these augmentees will not have undergone unit-level training prior to employment. More units and reservist replacements will likely appear in Ukraine, therefore, but the net effect on Russia’s actual combat capability will likely be small and diminishing.

And further to that, the Russians have already lost T-80BVMs, T-90As, Su-34s and Ka-52s, which are among their most sophisticated active materiel. Your ""The Russians are holding back their best troops"" is a point refuted a thousand times.",False,1648119592.0,t3_tlx7fe,t1_i1wu3ar,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

First off, that still leaves insulting wide open. There's simply no reason this needed to be filmed other than showing a russian soldier burnt and captured, so that is pretty insulting. The fact the video exists at all is enough proof of insult becuase there's no reasonably necessity for it. Second, it doesn't matter what the Russians did because international law does not run off of ""an eye for an eye"" mentality.

You're just repeating Putin's bullshit arguments against Democracy.

THINK about what you say.

&#x200B;

There's a couple of things you need to consider.

1: Putin and his mates have been pushing the ""democracy bad"" agenda for years.

They dont attack the concept of democracy. they attack it's implementation.

You should view it like most western people view communism.

on paper it's a great system, but in reality, it doesnt work.

THAT is how Russia portrays democracy.

They show Trump and his bullshit and tell the people. ""when you alow people to vote, this is what you get""

They show the protests in Canada and say ""see, the people aren't happy""

They show police violence in Paris and say ""this is democracy""

&#x200B;

Most people in Russia have an extremely skewered idea of what Democracy actually is.

Because functionally, that's what it is occurring. These standards were developed in the West as a result of various Western sociopolitical and socioeconomic activities. They are deeply rooted in the West's culture and lived experiences. 

In a lot of cases, the norms, values, and politics that lead to their creation were only generated after a lot of ordinary people suffered once the corruption lead to catastrophe. We can share the expertise that was developed in the aftermath of those events, and we have a moral obligation to do so if the other party wants our help, so that we can help them from having to learn those lessons the hard way.            



>Perhaps a good simple illustration of this is the concept of the 9-5 work day,

When it comes to anti-corruption laws and standards, a good illustration of this issue the concept of a jet engine. It's a technological achievement, and when sharing the technology, we share it whole-cloth as the best available jet engine technology that we have available.     

&#x200B;

>We should not privilege western civilization as superior without examining if the systems we impose are best suited to the place we are trying to impose them,

Indeed, we should not. But we have examined these particular systems, and we reasonably believe that they produce superior results. This is why we have been providing support to Ukraine to adopt them, why Ukraine has been eager to adopt them, and why Ukraine has been seeing positive results from adopting them.         

Also note the countless times that the Ukrainian government has explicitly announced that it wants to become part of the West.

I understand, at a deep level, the dangers of neo-colonialism and its history. But this is not an IMF structural adjustment policy. This issue is a recognition of a specific Western strength *by Ukraine itself*. 

The most recent and explicit example of this Ukrainian recognition was Ukraine's application to join the EU. This was a wildly popular move that will require the country to adopt the EU's anti-corruption standards (and all other standards) essentially whole-cloth.  

>humility is important in order to get accurate results.

Agreed. But humility isn't only about acknowledging your weaknesses, it is also about acknowledging your strengths. To not acknowledge areas where we have advantages that we can share--especially high-income Western countries that have technical capacity and resources that others don't---would also prevent the formation of accurate results.",False,1648143282.0,t3_tlx7fe,t1_i1ybpdx,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

That also happened to the Russians ancestors and the Germans ancestors. Are you gonna argue the mass rape and slaughter of German civilians was okay because it happened to the Russians years prior? Is it okay for Nato to round up russian citizens and kill them if war breaks out because Poland was occupied by the USSR for decades? 

 Also that's not your experience, I had ancestors die in the world wars also but that doesn't change the fact I'm a 21st century human on reddit, just like you. 

How about we agree neither this video nor the Russian War crimes are good? You have some sort of weird presumption that just because a people had attrocities committed to them before, that gives them full right to enact ones of their own. 

Its funny you argue that eye for an eye mentality because a couple ufc fighters are in jail rn for that same logic, ""something bad was done to me so the bad thing i do to them doesn't matter and is justified"". But really all you did was look at my profile to do a character assassination, becuase somehow in that little amount text you replied with, your mind ran out of actual points to make. 

And bringing up actual war crimes under the Geneva convention isn't ""crybaby"". There's a very good reason we have written laws made by very smart groups of people dictating this, becuase your common, emotionally driven and knee jerk reactions where one attrocity committed means all chaos can now be unleashed by whoever is exactly what lead to wars where tens of millions of people died on either side.

Problem is, I don't think the capacity to supply Eastern and SE Europe exists right now - production or shipping capacity and it'll take years to build.

May as well go for building out more solar / wind power, plus Hydrogen electrolysis for those areas that can't be decarbonised through electrification (well with current tech anyway).

 No easy choices - only shit and even shitter.

Still on the good news front the Russian Navy had a bad morning.

 >Bleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas, or the Border War was a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas Territory, and to a lesser extent in western Missouri, between 1854 and 1859. It emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas. The conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and murders carried out in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri by pro-slavery ""Border Ruffians"" and anti-slavery ""Free-Staters"". According to Kansapedia of the Kansas Historical Society, there were 56 documented political killings during the period, and the total may be as high as 200.
