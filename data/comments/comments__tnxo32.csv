Spring will come, the forests will turn green and for the aggressor a real hell will begin - Budanov

>One of the key components of Budanov’s job has been to organize a force of guerrillas who will stay behind Russian lines. He wouldn’t say much about the force, except that it is “a ***very*** large number of people,” raising the prospect of a drawn-out insurgency like that in Afghanistan or Vietnam. He mentioned that hunters had been drafted into the group, and I thought about the Ukrainian woodsman who blew himself up near Chernihiv with a grenade rather than hand over a list of local hunters to Russian troops. “Our warriors, our servicemen, even our hunters will start hunting the aggressor, the Russian forces, with their rifles in the forests,” he said. “I should say that soon the spring will come, our forests will become green, and a real hell will open up for the aggressor.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KNHAXbH_nY

It is a desperate plea from a soldier on a mission abroad to his mother, telling her that he doesn't know where he will die, and who will be digging his grave once he meets his fate. He decries that a stranger will put him to his final resting point, alone in a foreign land.

The tragic resolution to this song is the response from the mother, who - helpless to the plight of her son - can only give her promise to mourn his passing and that he will rest in her heart.

It is a traditional folk song that many a Ukrainian child learns during a time of mourning, but has received a new meaning during the Euromaidan protests, where Ukrainian government forces were ordered to shoot the protesters and hundreds of people were brutally murdered - not knowing in what place they would die, finding themselves in a country they could no longer recognize.",1648240924.0,1648240809.0,t3_tnxo32,t3_tnxo32,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

Fully taking Donbas just makes a future operation a little easier for Russia, in the same way troops massed and moved through Crimeria in this war.

Day 30 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today shelling killed 4 more people that were standing in line for humanitarian aid near a hospital. This only further confirms that they are deliberately trying to kill as many civilians as possible. They can’t take our city so they are trying to destroy it along with its residents, and after this they still have the audacity to say that we are brothers?

Their propaganda is strong. Even some people here believe that “Nazis” are the ones that are killing us, but it basically only works on people from Russia or those that only talk with Russians (for example their relatives). It’s honestly scary how potent their brainwashing is, and it’s even scarier when people not from Russia believe in it.

But let’s just try to follow their logic for a moment here. First – Russia invaded Ukraine, they confirmed it themselves, and so they can’t refute it. Then when they crossed our border suddenly our “Nazis” instead of fighting them turned around and started shelling their own cities and killing their families. 

Huh?! So they are basically confirming that they are working with our “Nazis” then? I mean they literally created our Nazis by invading in 2014, so their plan was to first create Nazis and after that come here and liberate us from them. Brilliant plan, I applaud them. 

Or are they trying to say that “heroic Russian soldiers” tried to stop our Nazis from shelling their own cities but they were too strong for them? Just picture this: the “liberators” invaded us, and then they saw Nazis shelling their own city and tried to stop them, they screamed “stop hitting yourself” but Nazis didn’t hear them. Instead they repelled Russians with one hand and continued shelling their own cities with another. Is that what we are supposed to believe here?

And not only that, apparently our “Nazis” are VERY resourceful, they are currently encircled in Mariupol, at the same time they are shelling Kharkiv, Kyiv, and many other cities. They are also flying Russian planes AND while doing all this they are also planning terrorist attacks in Lviv. They are doing all this just to paint Russia in bad light. Just who do they think those Nazis are, some world power with unlimited resources?

> 
> LONDON (Reuters) - Russia has reframed its war goals in Ukraine in a way that may make it easier for President Vladimir Putin to claim a face-saving victory despite a woeful campaign in which his army has suffered humiliating setbacks, military analysts say.
> 
> Russia attacked its neighbour by land, air and sea on Feb. 24 and pushed as far as the capital Kyiv - where its forces have been stalled for weeks - in what Ukraine and the West said was a bid to topple the democratic government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
> 
> On Friday, however, a senior military official said the real objective was to ""liberate"" the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army for the past eight years.
> 
> ""The main objectives of the first stage of the operation have generally been accomplished,"" said Sergei Rudskoi, head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate.
> 
> ""The combat potential of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been considerably reduced, which ... makes it possible to focus our core efforts on achieving the main goal, the liberation of Donbass.""
> 
> Donbass, where Putin has accused Ukraine without evidence of waging ""genocide"" against ethnic Russians - has long occupied a prominent place in Moscow's litany of grievances against Ukraine.
> 
> But if capturing the whole of Donbass had been the objective from the start, Moscow could have mounted a much more limited offensive and spared itself the effort and losses involved in invading Ukraine from the north, east and south.
> 
> ""Obviously they have completely failed in everything they've set out to do and so now they are redefining what the purpose is so they can declare victory,"" said Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. army forces in Europe who now works for the Center for European Policy Analysis.
> 
> ""Clearly they do not have the ability to continue sustained large-scale offensive operations... Their logistics problems have been apparent to everybody, they've got serious manpower issues and the resistance has been way beyond anything they could have possibly imagined.""

This thing should become the monument of modern Russia. Here's what I gathered:

1. It started service in 1991 and only did four short stints since then. The rest of the time it was mostly being repaired.
2. Bad design of the ship meant hard to reach pipes tend to freeze and burst. They fixed this by just shutting down all water for the cabins, and closing off more than half of the available toilets. There are only 25 toilets for 2000 people available now.
3. A SU-33 once fell from its deck to the sea in 2005. From what I gather it wasn't during launch or landing, it just slid off.
4. Once it sailed to refuel in Ireland. While refueling, it caused an environmental disaster by accidentally dumping hundreds of tons of diesel straight into the sea (it's not not nuclear, it's diesel powered by the way.)
5. Another time when it sailed by the british islands, the tabloids there created so much shitstorm about it that people actually started buying air purifiers. [I wonder why.](https://thebarentsobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/kuzze_in_smoke.jpeg?itok=7Y1z-j6T)(I got this from another reddit comment, so citation needed).
6. Due to a lack of catapult, only light aircraft with limited ammo can launch from it. People say that actual wartime aircraft rarely visits the carrier.
7. When it was being repaired in 2018 (or 2021, sources vary), a 70-ton crane fell on it, started a fire and sank a dry dock the ship was in. This resulted in $1B added to the repair bill.
8. Another $1B was added in 2019 when a welding cable exploded and caught significant parts of the ship on fire.
9. 2 days ago it was announced that [the ship is off for a grand adventure of more repairs](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-lone-aircraft-carrier-headed-back-shipyard-201390).

Lubkivskyi said the plot was confirmed by Ukraine’s intelligence service and special forces in charge of protecting Zelensky.

A perfect example of this is the main modernized strike plane the Russians use, the SU-34. A flanker variant made to fill a role similar to the US F-15E. It was mostly meant to perform long range patrols and strikes, while.being able to escort itself with Air-to-air weapons. Unlike most western fighters of this type, the soviet designers included a piss-canteen, ration heater, and small sleeping space. This was necessary of course because of how massive the USSR was when combined with the Warsaw Pact, and how big the oceans it would patrol are. Of course, when the USSR broke up, the Russian Federation didn't need something with quite that much range, or those kinds of lite amenities. After all, it would be simpler and more effective with the limited budget of the new Federal government to just make all Flankers multirole and have your patrol and deep strike pilots operate out of standard cockpits.

2. Rudskoi said there had been two prior variants for Russia in Ukraine.First to limit the operation to the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk.Second “operations on the whole territory of Ukraine with implementation of measures of demilitarization and denazification""

3. Now Rudskoi stated that the initial goal of what Moscow calls a ""military operation in Ukraine"" was to take over Ukraine's eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.That is a person low down in the Russian rank changes the aim of the war after one month.

4. This should have been done by Putin, Shoigu or Gerasimov. Why didn't they do so? They might have been all too embarrassed and kicked out their underling. Alternatively, the apparently still functioning general staff said: Enough is enough to their superiors.

5. The Ukrainian government has reacted as it had to. The Russians still want to expand their hold on Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while they are losing the war. Ukraine first of all wants to kick out the whole Russian army, and they can do so, and recover Crimea.

6. In addition, Russia would have to pay Ukraine reparations of at least $200 billion and Putin et al sent to The Hague. Ukraine is winning and has no reason to give up to Putin's lawless terror.

7. To me, this looks as if the Russian General Staff is trying to salvage their remaining military resources before the Ukrainians devastate them and hold on to some gains. As the Ukrainians are starting their offensive, they have no reason to stop now. Russia must leave Ukraine!

8. It is interesting, and positive, that the Russian General Staff dared to stick out its neck like this. It will be very interesting to see how the Kremlin (madman Putin) responds to this. Have the Generals cast the glove? ""

The way they are defining victory now is taking all of Donbas (including Mariupol and the full land bridge to Crimea), potentially some of the south Ukraine, as well such as Kherson

In addition, they will define victory as demilitarization of Ukraine (which they achieved by bombing much of their military-industrial infrastructure and destroying a lot of Ukrainian equipment)

They will also define victory as a 'denazification' of Ukraine, which they will likely proclaim once they have taken/destroyed Mariupol and the Azov battallion fighting there

The last piece of the puzzle would be to try to envelop the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region with a pincer maneuver from the south (after Mariupol is taken) and the north (from Izyum) and try to get a concession from Zelensky on neutrality (NATO/EU)

However, I am not sure that Zelensky will agree to anything but a limited ceasefire so Putin will likely have to settle just for additional Donbas++ territory and his demilitarization/denazification victory proclamations

The war will not end but will evolve into a semi-frozen conflict not unlike what we have seen in the region since 2014. Major military offensives will likely conclude soon (there is some evidence they want to proclaim victory by May 9th WW2 Victory Day holiday)

But the trench warfare type of fighting with limited but regular engagements can go on for many years

The West will also likely try to quickly rebuild Ukraine's military capability with a lot of weapons. And the sanctions will continue to destroy the Russian economy

Thus, strategically it will still be a huge loss for Putin, even if he does try to present it as a victory”

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-25/preparing-unthinkable-ukraine?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=tw_daily_soc&utm_source=twitter_posts

>From the Soviet era, the Kremlin inherited the know-how for weaponizing anthrax, brucellosis, glanders, Marburg virus, plague, Q fever, tularemia, and smallpox, among other toxic bugs. Soviet scientists even tried to insert the mosquito-borne, brain-attacking Venezuelan equine encephalitis into smallpox vaccines. At least three Soviet-era biowarfare labs remain inaccessible to international inspectors, so extreme experiments of this kind could continue in some form.

My question is:

1. How precisely do they keep biological viruses or chemical attacks from affecting their own Russian soldiers?

To that, the article says this:

>Russia can control some of the immediate dangers it might face from using chemical and biological weapons. It could outfit its soldiers with protective equipment, vaccinate them, and provide protective antibiotics in advance of any planned attack.

But after the past month I'm not at all convinced that Russia is competent enough to organize that kind of preparation.

As the article points out, few or no living doctors has ever treated smallpox cases. Most have never seen anthrax. And there are not enough antibiotics stockpiled anywhere in the world to treat a medium-sized Ukraine city for anthrax all at once. Some of the other outcomes are even more horrifying to think about.

I worked in hospitals for several years and we would always have disaster training that talked about these things. On some level I never really thought the world would be in a position where it had become such a relatively likely possibility. But looking back I realize how even hospital training in northern Europe or the US is probably inadequate too.  It is sobering and scary.",False,1648256108.0,t3_tnxo32,t3_tnxo32,,0,17,0,17,0,0,

Here's a summary of how Russia, at this point in the war, is depicting what it set out to do, why, and where we're at. (relaying their words, pls don't shoot msnger)  
Firstly, the generals said Russia had always intended only to 'liberate' the Donbas, that was what it set out to do. It had two options: fight a war in the east, but allow Kyiv to replenish its forces, or start off by knocking out Ukrainian military capacities across the country.  
Over a month of war, Russia has knocked out most of Ukraine's military capacities, the generals claimed, so can now move on to next phase, which will only be focused on the east, which could involve heavy bombardment.  
Russia had never intended to capture Kyiv, Kharkiv and other cities, the generals said - these are not setbacks in other words, it's all part of the plan. And the plan was to distract Ukrainian forces while Russia/ Donetsk/ Luhansk made territorial gains in the east.  
Numerous statements made about not targeting civilian infrastructure, avoiding civilian casualties.  
Defense ministry briefing also shared a new official figure for the number of Russian soldiers killed, the second statement by Russian side during the course of this war. Said 1,351 were killed - figure is far below Ukrainian and international estimates.

Some excerpts, but the whole thing is worth a read:

>With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are entering a new phase of warfare and global politics. Aside from a heightened risk of nuclear catastrophe, we are already in a perfect storm of mutually reinforcing global crises – the pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, and food and water shortages. The situation exhibits a basic madness: at a time when humanity’s very survival is jeopardized by ecological (and other) factors, and when addressing those threats should be prioritized over everything else, our primary concern has suddenly shifted – again – to a new political crisis. Just when global cooperation is needed more than ever, the “clash of civilizations” returns with a vengeance. 

[...]

>This tendency runs directly against the urgent need to civilize our civilizations and establish a new mode of relating to our environs. We need universal solidarity and cooperation among all human communities, but this objective is made far more difficult by the rise of sectarian religious and ethnic “heroic” violence and a readiness to sacrifice oneself (and the world) for one’s specific cause. In 2017, the French philosopher Alain Badiou noted that the contours of a future war are already discernible. He foresaw 

>“…the United States and their Western-Japanese group on the one side, China and Russia on the other side, atomic arms everywhere. We cannot but recall Lenin’s statement: ‘Either revolution will prevent the war or the war will trigger revolution.’ This is how we can define the maximal ambition of the political work to come: for the first time in history, the first hypothesis – revolution will prevent the war – should realize itself, and not the second one – a war will trigger revolution. It is effectively the second hypothesis which materialized itself in Russia in the context of the First World War, and in China in the context of the second. But at what price! And with what long-term consequences!” 

>Civilizing our civilizations will require radical social change – a revolution, in fact. But we cannot afford to hope that a new war will trigger it. The far more likely outcome is the end of civilization as we know it, with the survivors (if there are any) organized in small authoritarian groups. We should harbor no illusions: in some basic sense, World War III has already begun, though for now it is still being fought mostly through proxies. 

> Abstract calls for peace are not enough. “Peace” is not a term that allows us to draw the key political distinction that we need. Occupiers always sincerely want peace in the territory they hold. Nazi Germany wanted peace in occupied France, Israel wants peace in the occupied West Bank, and Russian President Vladimir Putin wants peace in Ukraine. That is why, as the philosopher Étienne Balibar once put it, “pacifism is not an option.” The only way to prevent another Great War is by avoiding the kind of “peace” that requires constant local wars for its maintenance.

[...]

>This is exactly what is happening today. Russia obviously attacked Ukraine, and is obviously targeting civilians and displacing millions. And yet commentators and pundits are eagerly searching for “complexity” behind it. 

>There is complexity, of course. But that does not change the basic fact that Russia did it. Our mistake was that we did not interpret Putin’s threats literally enough; we thought he was just playing a game of strategic manipulation and brinkmanship. 

[...]

>When Putin announced a military intervention, we didn’t take him literally when he said he wanted to pacify and “denazify” Ukraine. Instead, the reproach from disappointed “deep” strategists amounts to: “Why did you tell me you are going to occupy Lviv when you really want to occupy Lviv?” 

>This double mystification exposes the end of realpolitik. As a rule, realpolitik is opposed to the naivety of binding diplomacy and foreign policy to (one’s version of) moral or political principles. Yet in the current situation, it is realpolitik that is naive. It is naive to suppose that the other side, the enemy, is also aiming at a limited pragmatic deal. 

[...]

>Dugin, Putin’s court philosopher, grounds the Kremlin’s stance in a weird version of historicist relativism. In 2016, he said: 

>“Post-modernity shows that every so-called truth is a matter of believing. So we believe in what we do, we believe in what we say. And that is the only way to define the truth. So we have our special Russian truth that you need to accept…. If the United States does not want to start a war, you should recognize that United States is not any more a unique master. And [with] the situation in Syria and Ukraine, Russia says, ‘No you are not any more the boss.’ That is the question of who rules the world. Only war could decide really.” 

>This raises an obvious question: What about the people of Syria and Ukraine? Can they not also choose their truth and belief, or are they just a playground – or battlefield – of the big “bosses”? The Kremlin would say they don’t count in the big division of power. Within the four spheres of influence, there are only peacekeeping interventions. War proper happens only when the four big bosses cannot agree on the borders of their spheres – as in the case of China’s claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea.

>While we should stand firmly behind Ukraine, we must avoid the fascination with war that has clearly seized the imaginations of those who are pushing for an open confrontation with Russia. Something like a new non-aligned movement is needed, not in the sense that countries should be neutral in the ongoing war, but in the sense that we should question the entire notion of the “clash of civilizations.” 

[...]

>Ethnic and religious conflicts are the form of struggle that fits with global capitalism. In an age of “post-politics” – when politics proper is gradually replaced by expert social administration – the only remaining legitimate sources of conflict are cultural (ethnic, religious). The rise of “irrational” violence follows from the depoliticization of our societies. 

>Within this limited horizon, it is true that the only alternative to war is a peaceful coexistence of civilizations (of different “truths,” as Dugin put it, or, to use a more popular term today, of different “ways of life”). The implication is that forced marriages, homophobia, or the rape of women who dare to go out in public alone are tolerable if they happen in another country, so long as that country is fully integrated into the global market. 

>The new non-alignment must broaden the horizon by recognizing that our struggle should be global – and by counseling against Russophobia at all costs. We should offer our support to those within Russia who are protesting the invasion. They are not some abstract coterie of internationalists; they are the true Russian patriots – the people who truly love their country and have become deeply ashamed of it since February 24.

“Whether the Kremlin attempts to establish new “people’s republics” will be shaped by a number of factors. Foremost is how Putin redefines his war aims. As Kofman pointed out, Russia has overstretched its forces across three fronts, employing them foolishly. If Putin wants to claim some kind of victory in Ukraine, he will need to ratchet down his objectives. The areas recently occupied by Russia could be affected in several ways. For example, if Russia abandons its attempts to encircle and presumably bombard Kyiv and instead concentrates on southern and eastern Ukraine, Russia could attempt to take all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, rather than only those portions that the pseudo-states controlled before the war, and create a logistical corridor to Crimea passing through the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. That would require a mechanism to govern recently captured areas in the long term, and a “people’s republic” would be a logical means of doing so. 
Alternatively, as Kofman noted, Russia could use the newly occupied areas as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Kyiv, trading control over Kherson and other cities for other concessions.

Russia also faces serious operational limitations on establishing “people’s republics” in southern Ukraine. An unclassified report by the Estonian Intelligence Service identified two main problems: the persistence of protests and a lack of suitable people to lead new self-governance structures.”

I thought from start Russia would focus on the East of Ukraine. I thought they would've pivoted to that at least a week ago.

Such a tragic loss of life for what... ego... stubborness? As they tried to pull off a full scale invasion that was never realistic?

Gonna be really interesting seeing how negotiations go. I agree with Yanis Vanafourakis that its worth offering somewhat of a golden bridge for Putin to end the war with, some sort of ""win"" he can take back home. An outcome that leaves all parties slightly dissatsfied.

> **All pedagogical universities cancel the teaching of social sciences and world culture. Future teachers of Russians do not need all this**
> 
> 09:30, March 23, 2022 | Alexey Tarasov, Reviewer
> 
> The Ministry of Education decided to improve the quality of education in Russia, the prestige of the teaching profession, for which the country's pedagogical universities are being unified like an army system: they are introducing uniform standards for the training of teachers, saving them from humanitarian ""excesses"". Minister Sergei Kravtsov spoke about plans for such a “modernization” — in pursuance of the president’s order — last summer, mentioning the working title of the program — “Teacher of the Future Generation of Russia.” Now, the more its outlines become clearer, the more vague this future seems: it was decided to significantly lower the bar for a reasonable person in the coming Russia. The world is getting more complicated, but we have a “special way”. Perhaps, according to the Strugatskys: ""A fool has become the norm, a little more - and it will become an ideal.""
> 
> And there are objective reasons for this, and there will be explanations. For life in a besieged fortress, for extracting oil, for pumping it to China, humanitarian disciplines are not only unnecessary - they are harmful: thoughts interfere. And then, degradation is not for everyone and not always bad - classical designs are stronger.

> **Ukraine war: WHO says attacks on hospitals are increasing daily**
> 
> By Jim Reed
> Health reporter
> 
> There have been more than 70 separate attacks on hospitals, ambulances and doctors in Ukraine with the number increasing on a ""daily basis"", says the World Health Organization (WHO).
> 
> It says the targeting of healthcare facilities has become part of the strategy and tactics of modern warfare.
> 
> A recent casualty on 8 March was the newly refurbished central hospital in Izyum, south of Kharkiv.
> 
> It was hit by what the Ukrainian authorities said were Russian shells.
> 
> Video and photos posted online by the city's deputy mayor showed extensive damage to the main hospital building. A new reception area built last year was completely destroyed.
> 
> The footage has been verified by the BBC and other media outlets, although the exact circumstances of the attack are impossible to establish at this time.
> 
> ""After the first bombing, the windows of the hospital blew out,"" the deputy mayor Volodymyr Matsokin told the BBC.
> 
> A second attack destroyed the hospital's operating rooms, he added.
> 
> That day hospital staff were treating children, pregnant women and three newborn babies as well as soldiers and civilians injured in fierce fighting in the region, according to the Ukrainian authorities.
> 
> They were sheltering in the basement at the time of the attack and no-one was killed.
> 
> ""The government had invested millions to provide good facilities with modern equipment,"" said Mr Matsokin.
> 
> ""Patients had to climb out of the rubble on their own to escape.""
> 
> The BBC has contacted the Russian embassy in London about the attack but has received no response, although in the past Moscow has denied deliberately targeting civilians.

> 
> Spotify said Friday it’s pulling out of Russia entirely because recent laws restricting news operations could put the streamer’s employees and listeners at risk. It expects operations to be fully suspended by the end of April.
> 
> Spotify’s decision to pull out of Russia underscores the balance that Western media companies need to strike as they want to provide news to Russian citizens while facing significant challenges related to the country’s invasion of Ukraine and the country’s business environment.
> 
> Spotify is best known as a music streamer but it also hosts and distributes a range of podcasts with political content.
> 
> Spotify previously stopped offering Premium subscriptions in Russia but its free service was still available. It said earlier this month that it would close an office in the country and removed Russian state media content.
> 
> “Spotify has continued to believe that it’s critically important to try to keep our service operational in Russia to provide trusted, independent news and information in the region. Unfortunately, recently enacted legislation further restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalizing certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify’s employees and possibly even our listeners at risk,” a Spotify spokesperson said in a statement.

> 
> By AFP - Agence France Presse
> March 25, 2022
> 
> President Emmanuel Macron said Friday France was working with Turkey and Greece on a ""humanitarian operation"" to evacuate people from the devastated Ukrainian city of Mariupol under attack by Russian forces.
> 
> ""We are going to work with Turkey and Greece to launch a humanitarian operation to evacuate all those who wish to leave Mariupol,"" Macron said after an EU summit in Brussels.
> 
> ""I will have a new discussion with (Russian) President Vladimir Putin within the next 48 to 72 hours to work out the details and secure the modalities,"" he said.
> 
> The French leader said he hoped to ""be able to involve the maximum number of stakeholders in this operation"".
> 
> He said that he wanted to be ""in a position"" to conduct the evacuation ""in the next few days"".
> 
> Macron said that French officials had spoken Friday to the mayor of Mariupol and that the 150,000 remaining residents were left trapped in ""dramatic conditions"".
> 
> Authorities in the city have put the death toll in the city at over 2,000, and said Friday that a single strike last week on a theatre where civilians were sheltering was feared to have killed 300 people.
> 
> Russia has made the port city a major focus of its brutal onslaught on Ukraine as it tries to link up the annexed Crimea peninsula with Moscow-controlled areas in the east.
> 
> The Kremlin's devastating attack on Mariupol has drawn parallels with the bombardments by Russian forces that flattened Chechen capital Grozny and Syria's Aleppo.

Part one of this is right. Also they have failed to make a path to Odesa (couldn't get through Mikolaiv, tried to go around via Voznesensk, failed there too). Also have failed to take anything important in the northeast or Kharkiv area. The south is the only theatre of war where they have succeeded.

A completely fearless people, who **hate** you, and who dare openly defy your weapons to blast an actual song made about how your comrades in arms get delifed from above and sent home in boxes, and its an absolute banger.

For chemical, its actually ""easy"". Chemical weapons are known to not be very effective against a well prepared force\*. This is part of why they're banned: they're primarily useful for killing civilians and not soldiers, so if two sides are using them against each other, the outcome is basically the soldiers are annoyed, and massive civilian casualties on both sides.

*Yes, we can debate that maybe their soldiers are a lot less well prepared than they should be, but in theory, a modern combat force is ready to handle being attacked with chemical weapons.

On the biological side (also applicable to some chemicals), the weapons people studied are mostly things that are limited to the areas that get bombed. Countries weren't really interested in unleashing The Stand-style superflu. They wanted things like anthrax where the spores are sprayed around, everyone in the area gets sick and dies, but a week later you're safe-ish to go into the area (Sarin gas also works like this, it breaks down fairly fast). Or, in the case of e.g. smallpox, things where you can vaccinate your own soldiers ahead of time and have them be safe.",False,1648256703.0,t3_tnxo32,t1_i24zwp6,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

In theory they could have developed a vaccine for it but in reality its a weapon that really can't be stopped. They developed them by essentially natural mutation in alot of cases. They would take prisoners from the gulag, Give them the vaccine, and then expose them to small pox until they got infected. Then they would gather those new strains of small pox and get a new batch of prisoners to do it again. Eventually they naturally created a strain of small pox that a vaccine wouldn't protect you from. 

The u.s. spends a ton of money to destroy this shit all over the former soviet empire. You can't just burn this it in  a bon fire after all. This small pox can infect people from miles away. Not to mention they are in missles. So trained specialists have to disassemble them and give the bacteria a radiation bath to make sure its really dead. 

Anyways the really scary thing is thst the soviets lost a ton of this stuff. Like train cars of it missing. Who knows where it is. This is some of the stuff that the u.s. supposedly invaded Iraq for. The book demon in the freezer claimed that soviet era transportation boxes for this small pox was discovered in Iraq but no one actually found the small pox.

> Author Lyubov Stepushova

> 
> The United States is preparing, according to a proven methodology, to carry out a provocation with chemicals in Ukraine in order to find a reason to send NATO troops there.
> 
> Such ""chemical"" provocations are always preceded by a massive information attack. And it has already begun.
> 
> Biden threatened Russia with a ""response""
> The United States and its NATO allies will ""respond"" if Russia decides to use chemical weapons in Ukraine, US President Joseph Biden said after the end of the NATO summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 24.
> 
> As military expert, military translator Boris Podoprigora told Pravda.Ru , there are signs that the West is ready to escalate the conflict through Poland, but this means the invasion of NATO forces into the territory of Ukraine and direct contact with Russian troops, which is fraught with a third world war.
> 
> “Whether the factor of biological, chemical warfare will play in favor of escalation is difficult to say now. If serious studies of bacteriological and chemical weapons were carried out on the territory of Ukraine, then the West will now do everything to hide this and not pedal this topic. Because it is too dangerous for them, since the biological laboratories of the United States operate in dozens of countries,"" the expert said.

aa68422ae4625dc1569fdcc1dba22988,tnxo32,i24jocr,"Short answer: Ukraine means borderlands. In English we usually put “the” in front of countries named geographically. But also because During the reign of the USSR it was called “The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic” and After the fall of the USSR Ukraine wanted to distance themselves from it and dropped The and changed Kiev (Russian name) to Kyiv (Ukrainian name)

Long answer:

Professor Liberman says the habit of putting ""the"" in front of place names is heard throughout the English-speaking world and is common to Germanic and Romance languages.
""In general, use of the definite article is unpredictable. Why should it be London but The Thames? There is no logic for it yet this is the way it is.

""Sometimes country names go back to river names. As late as the mid-20th Century, everyone said The Congo because Congo is the river and named after the river, but no-one says it any more.""
He suspects that people once preferred to add the article if the place name related to a geographical feature like a group of islands (Bahamas) a river (Congo), a desert (Sudan) or mountain range (Lebanon).

""Later the phrases were shortened, but the article survived. Hence the arbitrary rule that river names, the names of deserts and mountain ranges need “the”.",1648248806.0,1648248500.0,t3_tnxo32,t1_i24ilpl,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

,tnxo32,i24k284,"I wouldn't discount the possibility of ""black swan"" events and regime change if Putin croaks. Russia replaced the tsars. They later got Stalin. Then the post-Stalin years, then the end of the Iron Curtain, then Putin... So there's actually been a lot of upheaval since the 20th century started, or even before then (assassination of Tsar Alexander III).

It hasn't been a case of constant seamless repression by all-powerful rulers for centuries, not at all... well, they all rule with an iron fist and they have that in common, but they also have iffy track records for straightforward transitions of power to successors. 

Another constant in Russia over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries was the tug of war between reactionary rulers and opponents wanting reforms. I'd keep an eye on that. Reformers might get militant. Putin's afraid of that, but well, Putin's basically an anti-modern Luddite, he's reactionary-lite and I'd expect his successor to be mega-reactionary. 

If my guess is right, Putin will be replaced by someone much like himself but maybe even stupider in the sense of being anti-modern (""anti-West"" is basically the same thing to them, I believe). Putin never had the mental capacity to catch onto modern finance or military reforms or even popular technology (rumour is that he doesn't know how to use a computer); that's not how Putin gained power. He gained power as a ruthless thug, climbing his way up through state security roles, he's a psychopath who gains power through fear and violence. 

Not quite as slick as say, modern billionaires who get it. Putin turned Russia into a gas station, that's as much as he can grasp. 

When Russia avoided a massive default on foreign debt a week or so ago, they delayed it by making a $117 million interest payment. They still face default next month. But someone made a funny observation on twitter that Elon Musk makes that in a day. All this to say: Putin has been out of step with the times, his successor is likely to be even more detached from this century, and a backlash from below could happen, eventually.",False,1648248669.0,t3_tnxo32,t1_i24hdr3,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

&#x200B;

Two big differences with Ukrain: 1) Chechnya was a small territory with like a million people; Ukrain is massive with way more people, and 2) The world basically didn't do shit to help Chechnya - it was a terrority within Russia looking for independence, so much more a ""domestic"" problem other countries didn't want to interfere with; for Ukraine, they have the world's backing in weapons, sanctions, and symbolic support

&#x200B;

My takeaway was don't count Russia out. As brave as the Ukrainians are, Russia is ruthless and may seek to torture them into submission. And Russia has been willing to spend years on such a project.

Not a lot of shock and awe. Not a ton of cyber in the beggining. Russia tried to minimize damage because it assumed it would have to fix everything it broke when it took over the country. So it was a lot of small unit action with no massive artillery support. It sounds like they sent in a bunch of guys that were more like military police because they thought it would be easy. 

They didn’t knock out infrastructure. Why is the train from Kiev to Lviv still operating? Why didn’t they knock out comms. Instead zelenskyy was able to do daily messages to his people. 

Maybe it was too late when Russia started using traditional tactics but we see devastated cities. 

And you can’t forget that Ukraine has been getting training from the west for years plus arms etc. and access to NATO’s recon and intel. Without that Ukraine may be losing. 

Russia’s big mistake was underestimating the resistance and how hard the fight would be. Had they assessed better and started from the start the right way, at least everything east of the Dnipro could be in Russian hands. 

Just trying to be fair. I lived there many years and have good friends there. But I still want to look at objectively what happened. And not this exuberance from people who just read headlines.

 >Knyaz Suvorov (Russian: Князь Суворов) was one of five  Borodino-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the first decade of the 20th century. Completed after the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, she became the flagship of Vice admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, commander of the Second Pacific Squadron. The squadron was sent to the Far East a few months after her completion to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok.

Absolutely, in order to fly through a lot of airspace, your plane must use manufacturer rated parts. If you are cut off from the world economically the only source of these parts is your existing stock of planes.

So, you either turn planes into parts bins, or you use unapproved parts on domestic flights and funnel the legitimate parts into a much smaller number of international flights.

Even then, so many parts, especially electronics, counterfeit just isn't an option.

Ultimately, if sanctions don't lift, Russia will either run out of planes or have to resort to upping domestic production of domestic designs, but even then the stuff they can actually build in a totally self sufficient manner is very limited. Old Soviet designs with analogue controls, mostly.

Note that it's possible instead of saying ""Я говорю правду"" use the other word but it will either imply that the speaker is trying to be a pompous prick, trying to pretend that he is never wrong or is reciting a religious text (those tend to use ""истина"").

The real issue was one similar to the issue Russia has and that the ANA had - corruption at the command and government levels.

 >Beginning in late 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, New York Times writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion. These demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state.

 >Causality (also referred to as causation, or cause and effect) is influence by which one event, process, state, or object (a cause) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (an effect) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause. In general, a process has many causes, which are also said to be causal factors for it, and all lie in its past. An effect can in turn be a cause of, or causal factor for, many other effects, which all lie in its future. Some writers have held that causality is metaphysically prior to notions of time and space.
