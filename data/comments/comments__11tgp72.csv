Day 386-387 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was a mostly quiet day, there were some missile launches from Belgorod in the evening, but they were aimed at Kupiansk. Today was a bit different, as Russians decided to do a medium-sized drone attack, our air force command reported that they intercepted 11 out of 16 Shahed drones, which they were launching at our cities for a couple of hours and only stopped about an hour ago.

From what I can gather the only confirmed hit with 2 drones was in Dnipro oblast. It wasn’t specified what was hit, but judging by the released footage they most likely hit a gas pipeline or an oil refinery. All that was officially reported is that they hit critical infrastructure, which almost certainly points to it being a gas pipeline. The gigantic pillar of fire that illuminated everything around is also pretty much a dead giveaway of it being gas pipeline damage. We saw the exact same extremely bright flame pillar when they hit a gas pipeline here in Kharkiv a long time ago.

I’m guessing today’s drone attack was the Russian answer to Putin being issued an arrest warrant by the ICC. Honestly that was to be expected, they always throw a tantrum when something doesn’t go their way. And while this is a mostly symbolic action, it still matters quite a lot, it’s not often that we see a head of state being pretty much officially proclaimed a war criminal. Also, Russians are all about symbolism, so inflicting symbolic damage to them isn’t useless, anything that will do reputational damage to their already abysmal country image is always welcome.",False,1679101264.0,t3_11tgp72,t3_11tgp72,,0,102,0,102,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 17 March 2023.  


* In recent days, Russian and Wagner Group forces have obtained footholds west of the Bakhmutka River in the centre of the contested Donbas town of Bakhmut.  

* Over the preceding week, the river had marked the front line. Ukrainian Armed Forces continue to defend the west of the town.  

* However, more broadly across the front line, Russia is conducting some of the lowest rates of local offensive action that has been seen since at least January 2023.  

* This is most likely because Russian forces have temporarily depleted the deployed formations’ combat power to such an extent that even local offensive actions are not currently sustainable.  

* Russian leaders will likely seek to regenerate the offensive potential of the force once personnel and munition stocks are replenished.  

* In the meantime, commanders will likely be forced to choose between carrying out offensive operations and conducting a credible defence of the full line.

Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed that he received a press question exposing a plot spearheaded by Russian President Vladimir Putin & Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev to undermine and “neutralize” the WagnerGroup.

Prigozhin’s press service published a claimed request for comment on March 16 from Russian outlet Nezavisimaya Gazeta asking if Prigozhin was aware of alleged discussions between Putin and Patrushev regarding the future of the Wagner Group.

The post claims that Patrushev suggested that upon Wagner’s destruction in Ukraine, Prigozhin will try to “unite the former and remaining active Wagner fighters under a far-fetched pretext,” arm them, and ""send them to the territory of Russia... in order to seize power in the regions bordering Ukraine with a possible advance inland.""

The post says that Patrushev has already ordered observation and control over the movement of former Wagner fighters and that Putin reportedly agreed with this step and thanked Patrushev for his efforts to “neutralize Wagner in general & Yevgeny Prigozhin in particular.”

Nezivisimaya Gazeta has not published the press comment on its own site, and no record of the comment is visible anywhere other than in references to the post by Prigozhin’s press service.

TheStudyofWar has not observed any information to suggest that these discussions have happened, nor has ISW captured any speculation in the Russian information space about them.

Nezivisimaya Gazeta has not published the press comment on its own site, and no record of the comment is visible anywhere other than in references to the post by Prigozhin’s press service.

The lack of external confirmation suggests that 
Prigozhin has fabricated the alleged plot to further several information operations on behalf of 
Wagner and his own reputation in what is likely the next evolution of his campaign against the Russian military establishment.

^*summarized*


[In an interview with *Fakty*, Kherson blogger Olena Naumova](https://fakty-ua.translate.goog/416766-ya-emitirovala-sobstvennoe-pohicshenie-chtoby-spasti-svoyu-zhizn-otvazhnaya-bloger-o-perezhitom-v-zastenkah-fsb-vo-vremya-okkupacii-hersona?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
 tells how she was arrested last year by the FSB for organizing patriotic protests and streaming pro-Ukrainian content.

She was held for 11 days and psychologically tortured.^1

She was told she would be deported to Ukrainian-held territory for “extremism.” That she will be prohibited from entering “Russia” for 3-5years, but if she goes back to streaming, the charges will increase to 10yrs. She was released, told to go pack her things.  The FSB visited her, she asks them which bus ticket should she buy, the FSB says, “we’ll drive you.”  She then understands they intend to kill her and began to panic.^2 

Serendipitously, she encounters *strangers* on the street who are ‘fans’ of her content, but notice she seems different and start badgering her with questions about what’s wrong.  She shared everything. They say they’ll be back to help.

Then, those *strangers*, visited that very night—they had a plan.  *We* will hide you. 
We will fool the FSB—you come now, take nothing, we leave your door ajar.  **The FSB will think a rival Russian secret service has taken you, and they won’t look for you.**
All this on the condition—you don’t even tell your family while you’re in hiding, zero contact with friend or foe.

She agreed, went to stay with a stranger, for 3 months.  Never stepped outside the whole time.  There was a plan in place for other locations, but she never needed it.  She had fooled them and they never tracked what had happened—that was obvious because they kept her passport with a stack of Ukrainian passports of political prisoners in custody—relinquished together with the political prisoners they freed the day before the liberation.

________

^1 ^(*She was held only 11 days, but received enough non-physical torture that she told location of her phone. She was kept in cell with no bed, table, or toilet, that already had multiple buckets of others urine, etc.*)

^(*She was drugged, so she saw visions and was wracked with fear. Another tactic she’d be doused in water, bag over head, connected to wires—so thought she’d be electrocuted, but they didn’t switch on.  She was forced to confess extremism and denounce it on video.*)

^(*Her friends, fellow organizers of patriotic rallies, were arrested, the man, a Belarusian, was in cell next to her.  She could hear him beaten, endlessly.  He was then removed and made to dig trenches.*)

It's not a long article, but for those in a rush here's some quotes:  
>Russian officials have already begun to portray the arrest warrant in a similar way to how sanctions are used in Russia, as an argument that the country is under siege from western powers. They are once again seeking a “rally-round-the-flag” effect, this time around the Russian president, by encouraging a siege mentality.  

It goes on to say:

>“Washington and Brussels now understand: if there is Putin, there is Russia,” he continued. “So they are attacking him. Putin’s strength is in the support of the people and the consolidation of society around him.”

>“Any attack on the Russian president we see as aggression against our country,” he said.

822bd13e4b2e21f33d82f1d3fa91a102,11tgp72,jckmeos,"Why is Ukraine so heavily defending Bakhmut?

**Deny Russia Strategic Gains**

Every piece of territory gained for Russia no matter how imperceptively meaningless provides Russia with greater options of infiltrating Ukraine. Keeping them tied up in one spot is advantageous.

**Spare Civilian Lives & Infrastructure Elsewhere**

The fact that Bakhmut is now a barren wasteland devoid of much of its original population is beneficial to Ukrainians having to tiptoe around civilians and put them in added danger. Every artillery shell of Russia that lands in Bakhmut is one denied from an unrazed and occupied village full of children.

**Favorable Ratios**

The ratio of casualties for each side is highly favorable. If Bakhmut was hemorrhaging Ukrainian lives at a rate equal or greater to Russia, then one would choose a different battlefield to fight on more favorable conditions. That would be a fair reason to retreat. But if one knows you're bleeding the enemy much more greatly than yourself, why change? This is simply economics. I've heard conservative estimates being 3:1, all the way to 10:1 Russian casualties. (NATO says 5:1; Ukraine says 7:1)

**Demoralization for Russia / Morale-boost for Ukraine**

Russia has come down on Bakhmut with pretty much everything they've got. Dipshit Loser Putin wanted Bakhmut as a consolation prize for the 1 year anniversary of their 3-day operation and was firmly denied that win. It's heavily embarrassing for Russia, and now to save face (they can't) they feel they have no choice but to double down on this piece of land. On the flipside, while it's pure hell for Ukrainians fighting there, it is still a massive boost overall that these brave men and women are holding on.

**Strategic / Logistical Lopsidedness**

Think about how much AA, artillery, and infantry Russia is commiting to take this town. That has broader implications to the integrity of their whole frontline. There's a cost to going on such a prolonged spear offensive.

To people who are surprised Bakmut still stands.

For a very long time Putin has argued that Russia will win against the west because they are willing to suffer more. Russians are willing to be in poverty and die for their country. Essentially, he sees Russia’s misery, suffering and complete disregard for human dignity as  his advantage over the West.

Bakmut stands because Putin is wrong. People are not loyal to misery. 

The reality is Russia is being utterly annihilated in Bakmut. If Wagner and the Russian Mod weren’t continually shovelling bodies and equipment into Bakmut, Russian troops would have been routed 20 times.

Over the last 10 months, Russia has had the equivalent of most modern countries’ entire military slaughtered in Bakmut. 

The scale of the military disaster is unfathomable.

Putin’s ideology insulates him from this.

Putin is looking on the map and seeing the incremental gains of a block here or there as a victory. He believes this is land Ukraine will never get back. In fact, in his mind the utter death his people have suffered makes Russia even more entitled to Bakmut.

Due to his moral corruption, Putin is blind to the fact that his military is getting slaughtered in the worst possible way.

Russians are walking into fights against Javelins and snipers with 40-year-old assault rifles. They have no night vision. Their artillery, while numerous, is rubbish. Their command structure is chaotic. There is no air support.

Imagine doing a frontal assault across fields and streets against prepared positions and defenders with modern weaponry.

No ideology protects you from drone dropped grenades shredding you in your trench or from long range tube artillery burning you in your barracks.

The Russian soldiers are like lemmings jumping into a ravine.

Sending lemmings to their death so you can eventually fill that ravine with bodies and walk across it, ….isn’t a victory.

Bakmut is a big fat military disaster for Russia.

Dead Russians can’t fight anymore.

The Ukrainians realise this, which is why BAKMUT STILL STANDS.",1679075006.0,1679074630.0,t3_11tgp72,t3_11tgp72,,0,112,0,112,0,0,

The Ukrainian command begins to withdraw units from the Belarusian border.

“The Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer believe in the entry of Belarus into the conflict. Units are being transferred to the most difficult sectors of the front.

Weird things I've noticed.... 
1. The other most talked about singular Russian talked about alot right now is Prigozhin... isw probably mentions him daily. I feel I could defend this pretty well.  Is he the only other? No but like the most? Yep.


2. He is behind the internet research agency. At least claims to be without much pushback on the issue.


3. It is backed by Yury Kovalchuk. He is a billionaire and banker in Russia.  He spent A LOT. Of time with putin during covid. 


4. Wagner has literal Gold mines in Africa. 


5. Wagner is opening this huge... HUGE center in St. Petersburg. For ""Technology""... sure I see you... 


6. Prigozhins media manipulation reminds me of Trump. AND Are probably one of the easiest ways for Him to communicate directly with Putin. 


7. Because as far as I know, they communicate through intermediaries. 


8. Now... isn't that strange. Wagner was at one point called... ""Putins private army"" and they DON'T like... chat at all?!? That seems strange... like even in this timeline..timeliness... there is this myth that Putin helped him rise... did he? Idk let's find out... 


9. It's speculated Prigozhin and Putin met in 1991...""the criminals Gennady Petrov (Russian: Геннадий Петров), Alexander Malyshev (Russian: Александр Малышев), and Sergey Kuzmin (Russian: Сергей Кузьмин) operated the casino through a Vladimir Putin issued license to establish JV Petrodin  in 1991. JV Petrodin, which Kamiyasu owned a 35% stake and Gennady Petrov and Sergey Kuzmin owned a 65% stake through their company BXM (Russian: «БХМ»), used the money from the casinos to provide capital for Bank Rossiya."" ... I'm just quoting Wikipedia sources... so go to the wiki for Prigozhin. 


10. Both Putin and Prigozhin are from St. Petersburg. 


11. Putin is 10 years older. 


12. Both Putin and Prigozhin grew up with a death affecting their childhood. Putins parents lost his older brother. Prigozhin lost his father. 


13. As far as Prigozhin and Kovalchuk, I'm gonna guess Bank Rossiya. Kovalchuk became chair of that in 2004. Sure it's 10 years later... but Prigozhin was opening businesses left and right in the early 2000s. 


14. His elder brother Mikhail Kovalchuk is the scientific secretary of the Council for Science and High Technologies attached to the president of the Russian Federation... that just.sounds like a kgb assignment.. my opinion there. No proof. But at this point I'm just letting my brain dump because it focuses the pain of this fucking heartburn. 


15. Kovalchuk has put a lot of investment money into Crimea. 


16.  I see a lot of Prigozhin vs traditional military. And I see a lot of discourse it means x or y. Personally I think it's obvious Wagner and the mod have quite a bit of clashing going on. I don't know how that will play out long term. I think that depends on how this spring plays out. 


17. YES, Wagner lost a TON of man power. All of Russia  has but we don't know how hard they are about to lose vs Ukraine. Ie... we have seen them on offense and we are about to test their defense. And which forces come out better from that may have a big say. 


18. I still think there is a research paper or something in viewing the relationships of dictators and such with a Narcissistic family construct. I found a book on the big five and dictators, so I'll read that and get back to you. 


19. Prigozhin probably does understand logistics from having huge catering companies. 


20. The ""threat"" against Prigozhin is fascinating. Isw said ""The lack of external confirmation on this subject suggests that Prigozhin has fabricated the alleged plot to further several information operations on behalf of Wagner and his own reputation. First, this exchange clearly identifies Patrushev and possibly the Russian Security Council as enemies of the Wagner Group. Prigozhin appears to be setting careful information conditions to blame Patrushev for Wagner’s failures and potential crackdowns against the group, as well as introducing an invented scenario wherein Wagner poses a direct threat to Russia domestically. This effort appears to be the next evolution of Prigozhin’s campaign against the Russian military establishment, and Patrushev could become Prigozhin’s next target after his concerted informational campaigns against the Russian Ministry of Defense and General Staff.""


21. Patrushev was fsb. Does that mean it's Wagner vs mod +fsb? Cause that seems like a lot.

> Therefore, I admit that at some point, when Prigozhin realizes that Putin may even kill him, he may decide to transit power. [*as in*, transition]

> After the last rotations, when several Wagner battalions returned from Mali, the Central African Republic and Syria, Prigozhin's security service began interrogating people using a polygraph, finding out their readiness to participate in SBZ (special combat missions) using weapons, including heavy ones, *inside Russia*—in Moscow, St. Petersburg and regions. That is, they form certain brigades from their internal army, which at the hour of ""H"" will be ready for decisive action—to capture, beat, smash.

Again, not the Patrushev discussions part, but yes, that Wagner makes plans ready to pounce, using their forces *in Russia.*

They are not stealthed platforms, making them just as vulnerable as Ukraine's current air force to front-line AA like Buks and deep rear AA like S-300s and S-400s. The F-16's armament options are also all outranged by larger, higher-altitude specialty interceptors Russia uses such as the Mig-31.

It's only being talked about quietly, so you won't see a lot about this in the news, but the reality is that the F-16 would only be used in a few smaller roles:

- It would occasionally be used to launch HARM anti-radar missiles on the front line, but it would be used the exact same way the Ukrainians already use their Soviet planes to do that -- by flying low, by itself, and suddenly popping up and launching a HARM missile and praying to God that it can fly back to base without getting tagged by an AA missile.

- The most common purpose the Ukrainians would use them would be in an anti-missile deep rear defense. A few F-16s flying over Lwov and maybe Kyiv could help shoot down Russian cruise missiles before they land on their targets.

- The F-16 would *not* be used as a bomber on the front line, because it would just get shot down by AA. Neither side can use front-line bombers without losing them to AA at this time.

Because of these issues, the F-16 is not a priority for Ukraine. It takes far too long to train the thousands of pilots, munition techs and mechanics, and far too much money to establish the logistical hubs for F-16s, than is worthwhile. The benefits they would give Ukraine in this war are marginal and are dwarfed by a lot of other faster, more accessible, more helpful aid that can be given now.

Same situation happened last year in the Kherson region, Ukraine was telegraphing an attack well in advance and Russia responded by pouring units into the area and embarking on a broad spoiling offensive.

Result was, at the end, a disastrous collapse of Russian forces probably with much less casualties and cost that if the Ukraine had gone up against a prepared Russian defence. Basically the same story around Kharkiv and Izium.

Russia command simply has a political inability to take the role of the defenders against an enemy that politically they must present as basically inferior and illegitimate (i.e not a ""real army"") even when it makes sound military sense and Ukraine are smart enough to remain flexible and change or postpone plans when Russia are repeating the same dumb mistake as they have time after time.",False,1679099239.0,t3_11tgp72,t1_jcmoclp,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Here's the StarTalk interview from 17 Nov 2022 on Youtube:  

[How The War in Ukraine Will Shape The Future with Irwin Redlener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dchD0D5SM-c).  

From the blurb:  
>How will the war in Ukraine impact future generations? On this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson learns about disaster relief and helping children on the front lines with co-founder of Ukraine Children’s Action Project and pediatrician, Irwin Redlener.  

The extended blurb:  

>What is the reality of war from a doctor's persepctive? Irwin tells us what it is like to be in a warzone and his experiences working with displaced children. We discuss the current state of humanitarian aid. Is there more we can be doing to help victims of war beyond satisfying immediate needs? What needs to happen to fully recover and build back after this conflict? 

>What happens to a childs education in a time of war? We learn about Irwin’s efforts to keep Ukrainian kids in school and to continue to think about their future development. What is technology’s role in all this? We explore the playbook for addressing future conflicts and disasters and the importance of asking a kid what they want to be when they grow up. 

>How do we make sure there isn’t an entire generation lost to trauma? Do we have any insights from past wars? Learn about mental health care for war refugees and how teachers are being trained to handle traumatized children. All that, plus, we discuss the importance of continuing to dream.

Basically over much of the contested area, aircraft have been limited at best for both sides due to the presence of layed AA defenses consisting of fixed locations, mobile units, and MANPADS. Ukraine lost alot of planes in the beginning and so did Russia. Many Russian jets launch their munitions far from the target, often over the Black Sea, Russia, or Belarus. Air support to ground forces also appears very sporadic. Ukraine has some munitions that allow them to strike farther than HIMARS, but not by much. 

So what would this mean in say a hypothetical skirmish between the US and a near peer? The US air dominance was uncontested in the Middle East after the initial destruction of enemy defenses. Could the same be expected countries with modern and robust layered air defenses? Nobody does stealth like the US, but would that be enough? Would the US SEAD & DEAD work as well against a larger and more developed military? It is hard to tell because it simply hasn't happened often.

There have been noteworthy skirmishes in the Middle east, but not between stealth aircraft so it is all hypothetical at this point because we haven't seen it happen and I caution agaisnt over estimation of US aircraft survivability in a hotly contested airspace with modern and layered comprehensive AA systems and radar.

There is value in holding it because at the very least it prevents the cities behind Bakhmut to meeting a similar situation. Now with that being said, it wasn't armchair generals advising to retreat, it was NATO and more specifically the US. The US felt Ukraine was better served marshalling resources and men for the upcoming offensive. They felt it wasn't worth the cost, not that it was impossible, at least at that time. 

Whether that was the right decision or not will be made evident with time. Ukraine of course does not release their own casualities, so we do not know the cost in terms of manpower or materiel. We also do not know if Bakhmut will continue to hold going forward. It could fall at any point, or maybe not. We don't know if the losses incurred holding it will inhibit future plans.

I think it was a hard decision for Ukraine, and personally I like the decision they went with. I understand why the US advised retreat, because to stay would likely mean unacceptable casualities as far as the US doctrine is concerned. Ukraine is fighting for their home and survival. To retreat is to open up more cities to devastation. To hold it could completely break the Russian assault and would be detrimental to Russian morale and leadership in such a way that it could very well be worth the risk and cost to stay.

The Ukrainan army leadership is on a delicate position here. First of all Ukrainian soldiers are dying, and the UA certainly has an interest in keeping that number low. But the K/D ratio is very on favor of the defense, and when you run war you can't avoid some losses. The effectiveness at which it weakens the RA, and the fact that it's helping Ukrainan territory safe means it makes sense for them to fight it as long as they can. The other benefit is that the huge difference in force sizes means Russia is spending a lot of resources and untrained man power, while Ukraine has more time to train its own army and gets the ability to use the new weapons it's getting from the West. Assuming enough time passes with the same ways people are acting, the UA will eventually have enough resources for another pushback. If the line slips a little that's ok, but the UA wants to make this as little as possible by slowing the progress as much as they can.

At some point, if Russia keeps throwing more soldiers at them, the UA will have to retreat or risk getting routed, it surrounded and fully captured/killed. The UA leadership knows this and is prepared to act quickly when that scenario happens, and has given enough clues of it. Enough that many guessed that the UA had decided that moment was near and therefore the retreat was going to happen soon. Turns out that they decided they can stick around.

As to what will happen or what will be done, it's hard to tell with the current information. Only people with access to the intelligence is able to make a prediction on what probably will happen.

Even when they went on the offensive they suffered repeated failures and on some occasions catastrophic losses for no real reward- and the war still ended in overwhelming northern victory 

Simply put the North won because they mobilized and shifted their economy to a war footing and because the south couldn't make good their own numbers or losses in men and material. Through a process of elimination the North gradually found more effective commanders and built an army which started out very ineffectual and ended up an enormous well organised and supplied effective conscripted force. And as long they sustained a high tempo of operations they could afford to sustain repeated tactical defeats because even if they lost more men per engagement, the cumulative losses  would gradually destroy the south.

I'm not saying that is going to happen in Ukraine but before thinking lopsided casualty ratios will inevitably lead to ukrainian victory it's worth remembering that it's entirely possible for Ukraine to win every battle for several years and inflict disptoportionate casualties on Russia and still lose the war.

Broadly speaking, helping an enemy of my great rival will weaken my great rival. That's the angle you would be looking at for explanation. 

Or you would think helping them would directly benefit me. 

Yah, I'm not seeing it. Getting a sweetheart deal on resource exports isn't going to be sufficient for them, I don't think. It puts them squarely in opposition with the west in a way that I don't think is beneficial. 

I think Pooh has been pursuing a hard power policy that's ruined the soft power policy that came before him. Before China was engaging in a kind of benign colonialism in Africa, building infrastructure and goodwill. They were stepping into the yawning vacuum of international authority the US left vacant with our idiotic war on terror. They could argue they had moral authority and were the adults in the room who could settle the rowdy smaller nations. They could be the paramount defender of the international order. 

Pooh threw all that out the window with more explicit hard power policies that burned through the goodwill and has made China look like a sackful of rotting assholes. Nobody likes them. 

They're still massively dependent on economic ties to the West and are giving the West every incentive to find alternative suppliers because there's too big of a vulnerability here. 

I don't get it. The late 20th and early 21st century has shown that old school imperialism doesn't work. Conquering countries doesn't work. Soft power and extending a web of economic influence will get you your global strategic goals. You have a military for defense in case someone else is a backwards caveaman and wants to attack but that's not how you win friends and influence people. 

And just look at Russia. They were fucking the West up with influence campaigns waged on our own social media platforms, weaponizing our own idiot citizens against us. The hard power moves he made were fast and over with before the West could even get its pants on. And then he goes for the full invasion and demonstrates why he should have kept doing what he was doing. 

China should look at this and realize they're never going to get what they want trying to conquer Taiwan. Better angle would have been for a cultural victory, making Taiwan want to rejoin the mainland. But in order to make that prospect attractive they'd have to change everything about who they are which isn't happening. But I think an invasion would make the Ukraine war look like a lesser conflict in comparison.

> The way Ukraine took Kherson back, with force while it seemed a lost cause

They did not do it ""with force"". They did it by cutting off the supply lines to Kherson, and waiting until the Russians go away. They have tried to take it by force, and it was a failure, resulting in high losses and meager gains. And everyone knew that the Russian presence there was unsustainable in the long run. That is why the Ukrainians tried to squeeze them, thinking that they will not put up a strong resistance. But they did, and in the end Ukraine just had to wait for the Russians to leave. 

> Russia proved to be unable to perform a decent offensive

I agree.

> proved to be bad at defending key places

To date there has not been a single case of the Ukrainians taking a fortified Russian position. In all cases it was either the Russians retreating (Kiev, Kherson) and doing that successfully, with the Ukrainians failing to destroy the escaping forces, or it was the Ukrainians attacking positions of the overextended Russians (Kharkov) and still allowing them to escape (at least they have managed to capture their equipment that time), and then getting stuck for months as soon as they reached prepared defensive lines.

&nbsp;

Ukraine has not yet proved the ability to break Russian fortifications. And as the frontlines have shortened and moved back, it will not longer be possible to count on taking unmanned positions or on cutting off supply roads (in deep Donbas the supply roads are literally inside Russia). The only option will be to use the new Western equipment to break right through multi-line defense lines. We will see how it goes. I hope that the Ukrainians will surprise us, but it still will have to be a surprise.

(Ironically, Crimea is the one place where it may still be possible to do the ""cut off the supply"" trick — that is why it is more likely to fall before Donbass, and if Crimea cannot be taken back, then likely neither will Donbas)",1679101834.0,1679099763.0,t3_11tgp72,t1_jcmhsvt,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Also rebuild what? You clearly have no clue what you are talking about considering russia is blowing through 50 years of stockpiles in 2 years of fighting.  The moskva cant be rebuild as it was built in ukraine, neither can most of the tanks, nor the jets.
 
Hell the T14 was supposed to be the new main tank and they ordered 2400 of them... they could only build 10 of them. The military strength they got was inherited they lack the means to build it themselves.
 
Meanwhile ukraine is rearming, and once the border is secured will move towards being part of NATO as its already in the works.
 
Russia will have enough nukes to keep its borders but thats it. They are also facing a demographic collapse which the death and exile of most of its young men will defo not help.
