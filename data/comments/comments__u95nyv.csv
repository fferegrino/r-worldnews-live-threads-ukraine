Day 58 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling wasn’t as bad as usual, they did hit some big shopping mall around 6 pm and it caused fire, but after that it has been very quiet. We haven’t heard anything in our area, there was just one report of explosions happening around 8 pm somewhere downtown and it has been quiet ever since.

Also Russia announcing that besides Donbass they also want to annex southern Ukraine is pretty bold and stupid. They are not making any progress in Donbass region, yet they are already looking at Odesa and even Moldova? Even if they do capture any of the cities, how do they plan to hold them (well, besides destroying them like Mariupol) when everyone living in them hates Russia? They are already being killed by partisans in occupied territories and it will only get worse for them. 

I really can’t understand what they are thinking; all of their actions just make no sense, it’s like they want everyone to hate them.

Update Day 59-60, 3 AM: too tired to write the full update right now, will post it in the morning, but I can already say that today was by far the worst day yet.

Update Day 60, 23 PM: sorry for not writing today as well, will definitely do it tomorrow.

Hundreds of wildfires have spread in Siberia, which is experiencing drought conditions. Fires are unprecedented in size and scope. Many Russian servicemembers who would help fight fires are in Ukraine.

Two different oil oligarchs are said to have killed themselves and their families in murder suicides on the same day. It's possible. Much of Reddit is skeptical.

Putin gives bizarre interview on state media where he looks concerningly ill, slumped in his chair, death gripping the table and only showing his right side. Physicians from Reddit Medical School were quick to offer diagnoses of thyroid cancer, Parkinson's and/or stroke.

Russia declines to storm the huge underground fortress below Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol with an unknown number (hundreds? thousands?) of Ukrainian defenders and civilians inside, opting for a prolonged siege instead. 

US provides new ""ghost drones"" specially tailored for Ukraine. They seem to be a loitering munition, but with greater range and capable of taking out medium armor.

US provides new current generation artillery, with long range precision munitions. This could allow Ukraine to shell Russian positions, *while they are out of range of most Russian artillery.* Given how much Russia relies on artillery for everything, this could be a game changer.

US announces new round of sanctions, including a ban on all Russian ships from docking at any US port.

In an interview with French media outlet Ouest-France on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said the country was “delivering substantial equipment, from MILAN to CAESAR and several types of weapons.”

“I think we have to continue on this path. Always with a red line, which is not to enter into co-belligerence,” the French president added.

About 40 Ukrainian military service members will arrive in France to get trained on the military equipment, according to the Elysée. 

MILAN anti-tank weapons systems have already been delivered, the Elysée said. 

The CAESAR is a truck-mounted artillery system with a self-propelled gun developed by Nexter Systems.

According to the company, CAESAR units have been deployed by the French army since 2009 in various countries, including “Afghanistan, Lebanon, Mali and the Sahel, Iraq, and East Asia.”

His party was in charge of all official media outlets in the country and was pushing brutal propaganda about his oponents.  Corruption was on unimaginable level - state was practically donating it's property to Mečiar's friend, as long as they stay loyal. There were ties between state and local Mafia gangs' heads, where state was ordering Mafia to do the dirty jobs, like murders and kidnapping. [Minister of Industry was killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1n_Duck%C3%BD) before he had chance to testify about his corruption affairs in trial.

And then Slovak people said enough is enough, there were big protests, and in the end Mečiar was voted out, and this dark period was over. Slovakia had became part of NATO and EU under new goverment.

I mean Russian people had chance to get rid of Putin in some point in the past - but it was their choice not to.

In the Donbas they haven't done a major push and haven't found a weakness in the Ukrainean defences yet. Coupled with them not being able to take Azovstal this quite clearly shows that Russian leadership is not comfortable with how many loses they have suffered so far and are reluctant to waste soldiers to take any objectives. This stalling happens while Ukraine gets more and more weapons and artillery to the front lines so when an attack actually happens the Russian loses get even bigger. A stalemate only favours the Ukrainians who are getting more weapons by the day and who are training their troops.

Given that even with the probing attack they have done they are losing roughly 500 soldiers per day I can almost guarantee that a failed main push with the entire army will result in huge casualties for the Russian army without major objectives.

Nevertheless with the more advanced equipment the Ukrainian army will be able to do huge damage to the Russians even when the Ukrainians themselves push to take objectives in Donbas.

TL;DR as in other areas, fair equipment but horrible human skills.

**As modern Russian EW/EA systems get towed into barns by Ukrainian farm tractors, it could not be clearer how epically Russia failed in the EMS battlespace.**

*A quick side note, good EA training is invaluable when it comes to being able to demonstrate the impact of jamming during a post-mission debrief. It gives the operator confidence their systems are effective.*  
  
*Second, one of the most common problems of EA in an undisciplined and/or undertrained force is the possibility of fratricide jamming. When the Russian forces activated their jammers during the initial invasion, Ukraine likely did the same thing.*  
  
*All this jamming would have been agonizing to military leaders on both sides, but which side does this hurt more? The offensive force that’s trying to move and attack. Defensive and prepositioned forces are not immune to jamming, but the effect is far less detrimental to their efforts.*  
  
*Arguably, Russian commanders at some point ordered their jammers to “Cease Buzzer” (the NATO codeword for “stop jamming”). The implications of this order are significant because it effectively means that Russia was going to, in part, surrender some of the EMS to Ukraine.*  
  
*This order also made it clear that Russian forces had little (if any) combined force training in a dense jamming environment.*

From CNN’s Benjamin Brown in London

The Netherlands is “firmly committed” to ending the import of Russian oil and gas by the end of the year, Dutch Minister for Climate and Energy Policy Rob Jetten said Friday.

The Dutch government will subsidize energy companies to fill its Bergermeer gas storage facility to 70% capacity by the end of the year, spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy Pieter ten Bruggencate told CNN Friday.

Subsidies were necessary as an incentive to import gas at current price levels, ten Bruggencate said, adding that the Netherlands would make an estimated 623,000,000 euros (about $672,000,000) available.

The state-owned energy firm Energie Beheer Nederland would top up the remaining capacity should the subsidy program not prove sufficient, ten Bruggencate added.",False,1650640857.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

I live in a small village “Lenino” in Crimea. The day after it happened [the attack on the cruiser Moscow], I went to a military unit in Sevastopol. There they took out a list of the missing, there were a lot of people on that list, somewhere around 30 people exactly. No one showed us any other lists.
I asked them to explain what ""missing"" meant? Was my son killed? They said that no, he was just not on duty and not in the hospital. Where is he?

My son was an enlisted soldier, there were many other enlisted men on this ship. That there were 200-300 conscripts, I am sure.

They went to the combat zone all the time. Nobody asked them anything. They would come back for three or four days, then they were sent there again - again for a week and a half.

""For the West, arming Ukraine is a race against time. As a full-scale Russian offensive in the Donbas begins to unfold, so the pace and scale of Western assistance increases.  


  
Britain’s arrangement with Poland to get tanks to Ukraine mirrors a similar deal between Germany and Slovenia. And the United States has just offered another $800m worth of equipment – the third package of this size in just over a month.  


  
It includes artillery pieces that are much more advanced than their Russian counterparts, together with staggering quantities of ammunition and radars capable of quickly identifying the source of incoming fire. And there are brand new drones, developed with Ukraine’s specific needs in mind.  


  
The primary purpose of all this is to allow Ukraine to withstand Russia’s attacks and prevent Moscow from taking more territory. But Western officials insist that Vladimir Putin must not be seen to succeed. At some point, that’s going to mean enabling Ukraine to go on the offensive.  


  
The battle for the Donbas will make or break everyone’s plans. If Russia succeeds, then officials warn it may turn its attention, once again, to the Black Sea port of Odesa, and perhaps even Kyiv.  


  
But if it fails, then Vladimir Putin’s whole Ukraine project will be in jeopardy. It could be weeks, even months, before we know which way it will go.""

“I want to say straight away: any ‘Kherson People's Republics’ are not going to fly. If someone wants a new annexation, it can only lead to new powerful sanctions strikes on Russia. You will make your country as poor as Russia hasn’t been since the 1917 civil war. So it is better to seek peace now,” Zelensky said.

He urged the residents of the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia to be very careful about the information they provide to Russian troops.

“If they ask you to fill out some questionnaires, leave your passport data somewhere, you should know - this is not to help you … This is aimed to falsify the so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show,” he said.

Zelensky thanked the prime ministers of Spain and Denmark for their support as they arrived in Kyiv and thanked the Danish prime minister for showing readiness to support post-war reconstruction in Ukraine, particularly in Mykolaiv.

The Ukrainian president also thanked the US for additional support, saying, “The United States has announced a new package of support for our state. We are grateful for that. This package contains very powerful defense tools for our military. In particular, it is artillery, shells, drones. This is what we expected.”

Earlier on Thursday, Zelensky addressed the Parliament of Portugal and said as of Thursday, Russian forces have killed at least 1,126 Ukrainians in the Kyiv region alone, of which 40 are children.

Michel said on Twitter he had asked the Russian president to grant Ukrainians immediate humanitarian access and safe passage from Mariupol and other besieged cities.

Boychenko said: ""There are already eyewitness statements from Mariupol citizens about the atrocities that they saw and are still seeing, unfortunately.""

He said the number of people killed in Mariupol is frightening, and ""over 20,000"".

He added that satellite imagery from Maxar technologies shows mass graves and ""there is some new evidence we obtained today from a different area"".

He said that Russian troops are ""destroying the city with its inhabitants"" and they're doing it on purpose.

article- 

An adviser to Mariupol's mayor has released horrifying new photos showing newly built mass graves in the besieged city, which Russian troops are reportedly filling up with bodies. Russian troops are reportedly dumping bags filled with bodies into freshly dug mass graves in Mariupol. As Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues towards the end of its second month, a statement from an adviser to the Mariupol Mayor accused them of the latest atrocity.  
  
The Kremlin’s troops have reportedly built several mass graves near a bypass road in the besieged southern Ukrainian port city, and are dumping bodies packed inside plastic bags into the holes. Petro Andriushchenko shared the statement on Telegram, writing: “Mariupol. Right now. War crimes. After a long search and identification of the mass graves of the dead Mariupol residents, we have revealed the fact of building mass graves for the dead in the village of Manhush.

“Near a bypass road, the occupiers built several mass graves, up to 30 meters each. They use trucks to deliver the bodies of the dead and simply throw them in bulk.” He claimed the bodies were all stuffed into plastic bags.He added: “This confirms our previous information that they are accumulating the bodies of the dead elsewhere within the industrial area in Mariupol.

Eligible account holders at ATB are covered by the Dutch deposit guarantee scheme up to a maximum of 10,000 euros per person, and it has 23,000 private account holders, the DNB said.

**Are loitering munitions going to define the future of warfare? Observers are watching the war in Ukraine to find out.**

*While Ukraine will undoubtedly find tactical successes with U.S.-made loitering munitions, the viral videos and supporting information campaign that is likely to follow will obscure and inflate the weapon’s role on the battlefield. To effectively learn from the employment of this emerging technology and understand its impact on the Ukraine conflict, it is essential first to create a shared understanding of what loitering munitions are (and are not) and subsequently examine the varying types that the belligerents can employ — as the Switchblade is not the only variant in question. In doing so, it becomes clear that while the addition of U.S.-made loitering munitions provides Ukraine with another tactical tool for destroying critical Russian military equipment, it will not “turn the tide” of the war, and analysts should not conflate its impact with Azerbaijan’s successful use of loitering munitions. Instead, the West should draw lessons from their employment in Ukraine.*

e18281217d27444df76c6e1bf3209702,u95nyv,i5su2hw,"On the artillery front, we're starting to see the West get their collective acts together and send Ukraine what they need not only to blunt the Russian offensive, but to go on their own offensives and rain hell down on the Russians in their occupied territory. I mentioned this the other day, but we need to see Western artillery donations continue to grow, both in terms of self-propelled artillery and towed artillery. In the grand scheme of things, it's not expensive for the West to replace these artillery guns. Most of them cost between $2-$5 million dollars each. In the world of military spending, that's peanuts. 

This is what we know has been committed so far. 

USA: 90, M777 howitzers and 184,000 rounds of 155m ammunition. One would expect that the majority of that is basic 155mm HE, but we can hope some Excalibur rounds were sent as well. 

Canada: Unknown number, although 15-20 is suspected, M777 howitzers and an unknown amount of 155mm ammunition. Again, the vast majority of that ammunition is expected to be basic 155mm HE. 

France: 10, Caesar howitzers and an undisclosed number of 155mm ammunition. 

The Netherlands: Unidisclosed number (suspected to be approximately 15) Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery, for which Germany will provide ""thousands"" of round of 155mm ammunition. 

Czech Republic: Undisclosed number of SpGH Dana and an undisclosed number of 152mm artillery rounds. 

That's what has been confirmed to have been sent, or has been committed to be sent, to this point. 

We're talking about, approximately, 135-150 artillery systems. I think that's a really good start, but another 100-150 are probably neccessary for a Ukrainian counter offensive that could push Russia out. So who could send more? 

The United States could likely send another 50-100 M777s and millions more rounds of ammunition. Their military industrial complex can replace military kit at a pace that is far more rapid than anyone else. The USA has 1000 M109 self-propelled howitzers. They're older and will soon be replaced, but I suspect they could part with roughly 100 of them in the meantime, if they wanted to. They also have a pile of M270 and M142 rocket artillery, but I doubt they're going to offering it any time soon.

Australia has a similar number of M777s as Canada did prior to their shipment to Ukraine. The Aussies could likely afford to send a similar number (15-20) and have them backfilled in reasonably short order. 

Slovakia has 16, SpGH Zuzana, which are 155mm howitzers that they're in the process of replacing with the new Zuzana 2. They might very well be willing to sell their existing Zuzana's to Ukraine, given that they are about to retire them. 

Italy has a 54 Panzerhaubitze 2000 and like the Dutch, they could probably spare 10-15 have them backfilled through procurement, down the road. Italy also has 90, FH70, towed howitzers, which are older, but still effective. They could certainly donate some of those. 

Germany has approximately 108 Panzerhaubitze 2000s. It's laughable that they say that they can't spare 20-25 of them, given that they produce them in Germany and the company that makes them says they could deliver 100 brand new ones between 2024-2027. Olaf will be Olaf though. 

Poland: It's doubtful that the Poles will want to part with any of their new Krab or Rak systems that they're quickly procuring, but they do have a bunch of artillery that can help the Ukrainians out. They possess 111 Czech Dana's that they are in the process of replacing. They also possess 350+ Gozdik, which are 122mm, self propelled howitzers. They have about half of them in storage and could likely spare some. My only question about them is how much ammunition they can spare. 122mm is a strange make. Lastly, they're in the process of replacing roughly 90, BM-21 Grad, rocket artillery systems, with American made HIMARS. The Ukrainians already use the Grad, they would welcome as many more as the Poles are willing to send. 

Those are just a few of the countries that could help the number of committed artillery pieces jump from the current range, to the 250-300 range that I'd like to see it reach. Obviously, extensive training is required to operate the different systems, however, the Americans and French have already started teaching their systems to Ukrainians, in Poland and in France.",1650662857.0,1650662494.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

Ignore the fact that it's from Metro, but it's the video of that meeting and this is what I (non healthcare professional) have taken from it:

Putin never turns his head and his left side is completely still. Left arm and leg never move once. 

Right lower leg and foot twitch repeatedly. Camera actually moves from wide shot to close up as if to hide this fact, before going back to the wide shot where you can still see twitchy, repetitive movement. 

Right hand is gripping the table tightly, thumb is also twitching repetitively. 

Torso appears to be slouched in chair and leaning towards the left. 

There's something not quite right with how his legs are positioned. He barely moves in the seat. He looks like a physically disabled person who was placed there and his legs were put to sit in line with the front legs of the chair (this could be his typical position when sitting, but it just looks 'off' to me). A sack of potatoes dumped in a chair is a good comparison. 

His complexion is not what I'd call healthy, it's pasty - the complexion of someone who is unwell and again, could be the result of medication. 

Suspect he's had at least a mild stroke on the left side, and he's either got proper Parkinson's disease or medication induced shaking. He's definitely not long for this world. 

Again, not a medical professional just basing his appearance on people I know who've had a stroke, got Parkinson's disease or Multiple Sclerosis. He looks like them.",False,1650612201.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

decision point. It had not yet clearly articulated a case for war.  
Indeed, public discussion of war was prohibited. It could reduce the  
scale of its ambition and thereby prepare the population to accept  
de-escalation. Instead, the decision was made to not only continue  
with the narrative of a struggle against Nazism in Ukraine, but to  
expand the scope of ambition to one of systems confrontation.  
Examining internal Russian government documents from mid-March shows  
that the decision to ideologically mobilise the Russian public for  
war with the use of increasingly radicalising language was not a  
nationalistic response to events but was instead directed centrally  
and accompanied by practical, organisational steps to put Russia on a  
war footing. On 24 March, for example, the Governor of Bryansk,  
Alexander Bogomaz, issued instructions to all local authorities  
declaring that ‘the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, despite  
significant human losses, continue to restore order in Ukraine,  
repeating the feat of the Heroes of the Great Patriotic War’. He  
ordered that local authorities prepare to ‘conduct briefings in  
educational institutions on the procedure for the actions of  
students, as well as employees in the event of artillery shelling or  
air strikes’ and that local authorities must ‘carry out, together  
with patriotic organizations, preparatory work on the formation of  
public local defense detachments’. Businesses  
were also instructed to prepare anti-tank defences, along with a  
range of additional measures. Most importantly, officials were to  
report back on the measures they were taking and would be held  
accountable for implementation. There was, at the time, no threat of  
Ukrainian incursions into Russia. These orders therefore show how the  
sense of a territorial threat to the country was being cultivated to  
justify the war.

1. There are millions of Ukrainians or people with Ukrainian ancestry living in Russia. Some moved during the Soviet Union some after 1991 but there are millions of them there. Many work in high technological areas. At the beginning of the war there were reports of Russian police harassing Ukrainians in Moscow under the suspicion of working with Ukrainian authorities but they can't harass all of them. We don't know with how many of them the Ukrainian secret services have contact.  
  
2. Other millions of people in Russia have relatives or connections in Ukraine. Before the war happened in interviews published many Russians claimed that it would be madness to attack Ukraine due to the number of citizens of Russia who have relatives in Ukraine.  
  
3. A significant part of the Russian population is against the war. Keep in mind that on Russian and Ukrainian telegram channels there are hundreds of pictures of cars with Z symbols on them smashed by random people in Moscow and Sankt Petersburg. Also many attacks in Russia against Z monuments. We don't know how many people in Russia actually oppose the war due to Russia being a dictatorship but the evidence suggests there are a lot.  
  
4. A large part of the people of the ""Russian Federation"" aren't ethnic Russians (hence why I put Russian Federation between """").

The Circassians, Caucasus people and many in Siberia are some of the few that come to mind right now. Many relate to the Ukrainian struggle. Moreover Russia recruits a lot of minorities into the army to be used as canon fodder and thousands have died in the war started by the Russians and many are aware of that.  
  
5. A lot of materials required for Russian industrial production come from the West. Now they are under sanctions. Russians have to use home made parts now for a lot of things with different levels of results.

Interest swelled to passion when extremists overran his childhood village and torched the primary school where his brother taught.

Border cover in the western and north-western directions has been strengthened. Air defense forces and means have been transferred to reinforced duty. The protection of headquarters, communications centers, military camps, arsenals, bases and warehouses for weapons, military equipment and fuels and lubricants has been strengthened.

In the Izyum direction, the Russians concentrated up to 25 BTGs from the 1st Panzer Army, the 20th and 35th All-Military Armies and the 68th Army Corps of the Eastern Military District, and the airborne troops of the Russian Armed Forces.

In the South Bug area , the enemy continues to fire on units of the Defense Forces, tried to conduct reconnaissance by fighting in the Trudolyubivka area, suffered losses, and retreated to previously occupied positions.

In the temporarily occupied territories, enemy units continue to block the movement of local people, loot and artificially approach the humanitarian crisis - destroy critical infrastructure and block the delivery of humanitarian goods from Ukraine. There have been cases of executions of civilians and volunteers.

In the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Armed Forces repulsed ten attacks by the Russian occupiers, destroyed six tanks, eight armored units and fifteen vehicles, and four artillery systems.

In addition, 15 air targets were destroyed: nine UAVs, three planes and three helicopters.""

*article-*

WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - Newly disclosed ""Ghost"" drones that are part of America's latest arms package for Ukraine were developed by the U.S. Air Force for attacking targets and are destroyed after a single use, the Pentagon said on Thursday.  
  
The United States and its allies have ramped up arms shipments to Kyiv ahead of Russia's announced offensive in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow tries to salvage its nearly two-month old campaign.  
  
Ukrainian forces have used Western weapons including Stinger and Javelin missiles along with drones, like the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and U.S.-made Switchblade, effectively to target Russian positions.  
  
The White House said earlier on Thursday that over 121 Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial Systems would be provided to Ukraine as part of the new arms package. read more  
  
The Pentagon said the Ghost drones are well suited for the coming fight in Ukraine's Donbas region, which officials have described as flat terrain reminiscent of the U.S. state of Kansas.  
  
""It was developed for a set of requirements that very closely match what the Ukrainians need right now in Donbas,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said, without elaborating.  
  
Little else is known about the drones, including their range and precise capabilities, and Kirby declined to offer more details about them.  
  
Still, he did say they were designed mainly for striking targets.  
  
""It can also be used to give you a sight picture of what it's seeing, of course. But its principal focus is attack,"" Kirby said.  
  
A small number of Ukrainians have been trained in the United States on how to operate Switchblade drones, single-use weapons that fly into their targets and detonate on impact.  
  
Kirby said training for the Ghost drones would be similar to the training on the Switchblade. But he declined to detail training plans or say how many Ukrainians would be trained on the new system.  
  
The Ghost drones have not yet been delivered to Ukraine.  
  
Earlier on Thursday, Kirby said the drones had been rapidly developed for Ukraine. But later, at a news conference, he clarified that development had started before the Russian invasion on Feb. 24.

Russia is shifting its elite military units away from the besieged city of Mariupol to eastern Ukraine where they “pounded away at cities across the region”, according to the Associated Press.

Cities and villages across Donbas – an industrial region in the eastern part of Ukraine – were bombarded as the Kremlin sent over more than 100,000 new troops from Syria and Libya into Ukraine.

From the AP:

Mariupol has taken on outsize importance in the war. Capturing it would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port and complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin seized from Ukraine in 2014.

It would also enable Putin to throw more of his forces into the potentially climactic battle for the Donbas and its coal mines, factories and other industries, or what the Kremlin has now declared to be its main objective.

[Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council] reported that some 12 to 14 of Russia’s elite military units have, in fact, left Mariupol and begun moving to the east to take part in the fighting there.

“It will now be difficult for our forces, because our guys in Mariupol were taking [those units] on themselves. It is their courage and feat,” he said.
Danilov also said Kyiv was able to deliver weapons via helicopter at great risk under cover of night to the Mariupol steelworks, which have been bombarded for weeks.",False,1650670200.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

France and Germany armed Russia with €273 million (£230 million) of military hardware now likely being used in Ukraine, an EU analysis shared with The Telegraph has revealed.

They sent equipment, which included bombs, rockets, missiles and guns, to Moscow despite an EU-wide embargo on arms shipments to Russia, introduced in the wake of its 2014 annexation of Crimea.

The European Commission was this month forced to close a loophole in its blockade after it was found that at least 10 member states exported almost €350 million (£294 million) in hardware to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Some 78 per cent of that total was supplied by German and French firms.",False,1650663735.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

e18281217d27444df76c6e1bf3209702,u95nyv,i5pmutl,"Based on the variety of sources out there, including the Pentagon, the Ukrainian Military, Russian State sources, etc... My guess is that Russia has suffered roughly 20,000 KIA to this point, when you account for the confirmed dead and those listed as missing. Using the normal 3 to 1 equation of wounded to killed, gives us a number of 80,000 total casualties. That seems extreme to me, although 60,000 doesn't, given that they are on the offensive, against heavily fortified positions.

Therefore, I'm going to guess that out of the 200,000 troops they initially massed for the invasion + the mercenaries and reservists they've called up, the current Russian Army dedicated to the invasion stands about 160,000 in strength. Of that number, I suspect that 80,000-90,000 of them are support personnel made up of cooks, techs, air crew, medical staff, logistical staff, retainers, supply techs, general staff, etc... Operating well behind the front lines, back in Russian staging locations such as Belgorod and Belarus. That leaves roughly 70,000-80,000 combat arms soldiers, marines, Chechnyans and mercenaries assaulting Ukraine as it currently stands. 

On the other side of the conflict it's far more difficult to get a good grasp of the numbers, but I'll try. Before the start of the War, Ukraine had a military of roughly 250,000 personnel on paper. I believe that number was likely inflated and was closer to 200,000. Since the outset of the war Ukraine claims to have added approximately 100,000 Ukrainians to its territorial defense force. While that number is believable on paper, I highly doubt they've received enough supplies to fully mobilize that many troops into combat roles. The majority of them are likely working behind the scenes to aid with logistics and to try to keep the country moving. Ukraine is also home to approximately 119,000 police officers at the outbreak of the conflict, of whom a good number are probably included in their military figures (national police) and others will have joined their territorial defense force. Finally, there seems to be somewhere between 15,000-20,000 foreign nationals fighting on Ukraine's side. My best guess is that their total military and police forces stood around 350,000 in size, prior to casualties. Of that 350,000, however, I suspect that their combat arms make up about 150,000 total, between regular army troops, foreign fighters and territorial defense forces currently fighting in a combat role. 

As for casualties, I believe them to be higher than has been reported to this point, but lesser than the Russians, due to the defensive nature of their operations. You almost always take more casualties while on the offensive. My best guess is somewhere around 12,000 KIA / MIA and 20,000-25,000 wounded. 

The good news is that the Ukrainians still have alot of manpower to throw at this effort, unfortunately, they will be replacing their seasoned troops, with quite a bit of inexperience, which will lead to more casualties along the way. The good news, however, is that as long as weapons keep flowing in from NATO, the EU and Asian Allies, Ukraine is being afforded a lot of time to train up and equip new troops. One can only hope that is being done, aggressively, both in Ukraine and Poland, as well as abroad. 

The reality of this war is that a win for Ukraine will involve trading mass loss of life, to slowly grind down Russian military assets such as their armor, aircraft fleet and artillery. If Ukraine is willing to lose 100,000+ troops and the West continues to fund them for as long as it takes, this war will not be winnable for Putin and he will be stopped after taking more land in the Donbas. The question then becomes whether the Ukrainians will be willing to lose thousands more men and women in an attempt to drive the Russians out all together, and whether or not, the West will keep up the influx of supplies and funding neccessary, in order for them to support such an offensive.",1650604629.0,1650602646.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,23,0,23,0,0,

4 videos and 23 bodies in total. All near Ilych Steel Works. One video filmed by Patrick Lancaster, former U.S. Navy intelligence officer who has been posting videos from eastern Ukraine since 2014.  Another video is filmed by Italian journalist Vittorio Nicola Rangeloni. Mr Rangeloni, who lives in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, began posting videos from Mariupol in late March.

The third and fourth videos were uploaded by Russian agency ANNA News and the pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, Signal.

It is not clear when the videos were filmed

Passers-by in the videos say a Ukrainian sniper killed those people.

The BBC spoke to people about the physical evidence at the scene. An unnamed former military sniper says  ""The wounds are not consistent with sniper shots.""

Dr. Victoria Weedn said: ""The bodies scattered over the roadways near a factory appear to have all died about the same time.

""The image is of clothed bodies at a distance and does not allow a definitive determination of the cause of death, but it is suspected they were shot, probably in the head.""

Dr Carl Wigren, a forensic pathologist, also concluded the victims had died at ""very near the same time"" but, again, could not be definitive about the cause of death.

But examines why Orban kinda likes Russia: The Russian Empire takes Poland, the Baltics, and East Germany, fine with him. Meanwhile in Hungary, they think recreating the Greater Hungary, or even Austro-Hungary, is a great idea.

**Orban’s ‘Greater Hungary’ Map Creates Waves in Neighbourhood**

*Croatian and Romanian leaders have both responded, albeit in different ways, to a map of ‘Greater Hungary’ posted by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, recalling Hungary’s one-time rule over several of its neighbours.*

[*https://balkaninsight.com/2020/05/07/orbans-greater-hungary-map-creates-waves-in-neighbourhood/*](https://balkaninsight.com/2020/05/07/orbans-greater-hungary-map-creates-waves-in-neighbourhood/)

**How Viktor Orban turned a century of Hungarian history into a secret weapon**

*The loss of empire remains palpable today. Visit a Hungarian official’s office and you will sometimes see a framed map of pre-Trianon Hungary on the wall, perhaps including small vials of soil from the “lost lands” in modern-day Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania or Serbia. Orban has proven remarkably adept at mobilizing this nationalist nostalgia.*

*In recent years, Orban’s government has downgraded public commemoration of Hungarians who embody more democratic values while actively promoting memorials to Hungarian leaders allied with Hitler and Mussolini during World War II. Most notoriously of all, Orban has embraced Regent Miklos Horthy, Hungary’s fascist and anti-Semitic dictator in the 1930s, precisely because under Horthy’s leadership a portion of Trianon was overturned with Hungary’s spiritual heartland province of Transylvania annexed in 1940. (Transylvania was restored to Romania, where it had spent most of the interwar period, on March 6, 1945, after the Horthy regime’s collapse in 1944.)*

*Since he returned to power after a spell in the opposition in 2010, Orban pushed through the passage of a law enabling foreigners who had a Hungarian ancestor and “knowledge” of the Hungarian language to receive Hungarian passports. Of several million who were eligible, some 700,000 had received citizenship by 2015. In 2013, Orban urged ethnic Hungarians around Europe “to unite” in order to make the country “a strong nation.” In 2014, in his annual summer speech in Romania (which is still home to approximately 1.5 million ethnic Hungarians today), Orban acknowledged that he owed his sweeping electoral victory earlier that year to the voting rights of ethnic Hungarians living abroad. That was the same speech in which he declared his aspiration to transform Hungary into an “illiberal state.”*

Some excerpts… 

> **Chinese President Xi Jinping is proposing a ""global security initiative"" that upholds the principle of ""indivisible security""** — a concept that means no state should strengthen its security at the expense of another nation — **and is also endorsed by Russia.**

>[…]

>""We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, **build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security based on insecurity in other countries,""** [Xi] said.

>In talks over Ukraine, Russia has insisted that Western governments respect a 1999 agreement based on the principle of ""indivisible security"".

>China and Russia have grown increasingly close, and China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. **Instead, China has blamed the Ukraine crisis on NATO's eastward expansion.**

>Analysts note this was the first time China had argued for ""indivisible security"" outside the context of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, with implications for Asia and the Pacific.

>Wang Jiangyu, a law professor at the City University of Hong Kong, said **by evoking the concept of ""indivisible security"", which had originated in Europe, China could hope to make its actions in defence of its core interests appear more legitimate to other countries.**

I have been reading up as much as I can regarding the Russian view of de-nazification of Ukraine.  I try to have as much of an open mind as possible when it comes to things.  I also have one of my oldest friends who unfortunately latched on hard to this idea and spends a lot of his time linking to “Ukrainians are fascist” posts and articles.  Just for my own enlightenment I read an article but it led me down a rabbit hole of trying to understand the situation better.  It is going to be difficult to boil down close to 80 years of Ukrainian-Russian tensions into a few paragraphs, so I will try to highlight what I see as the main motivations behind Putin’s movement and why it is idiotic cherry picking to the highest order.


The “re-nazification” of Ukraine, in Putin’s eyes, began in the early 2000s with the Orange Revolution in Ukraine that were repealing what was a rigged election, that pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, won.  Not surprisingly, most of his support stemmed from the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine while his opposition, Viktor Yushchenko (I know, so similar!), had most of the support in the central and western parts of the country.  The Orange Revolution was unprecedented for Ukraine at the time as it showed for the first time that the country may not be as complicit now with government corruption, closer ties with Moscow, and the oppression they had allowed for the last decade or so post USSR collapse.  It is worth pointing out here that in 1994, Ukraine signed over its effectively useless nuclear arsenal (they had the weapons but no codes) back to Russia under the Budapest Memorandum that explicitly stated, in short, that Russia, the UK, and the US stay out of Ukraine’s business and leave its sovereignty alone from then on.  It was signed by all parties.  Pre-Orange Revolution, newly minted President Putin stated sometime around 2000/2001 that Ukraine sovereignty should be respected, and free to pursue EU and possibly even NATO membership.  This is something that young Putin, certainly more progressive than he was today, saw for Russia as well.  Post-Orange Revolution, Putin saw Ukraine as a threat to his power and the power of protest and large groups to be able to topple corrupt politicians.  This is when the first modern rumblings of a “Nazi Ukraine” began to bubble up on the internet.  This is also when he stopped seeing Ukraine as a sovereign nation as he believed that the US and NATO had violated the terms of the Budapest Memorandum and nurtured an uprising in Ukraine to align it closer to the west.  The only evidence I could find to support this, of course, came from sources inside Russia.


All things considered, things went mostly smoothly between Russia and Ukraine for the following years during Yushchenko’s presidency, or at least they are not widely reported on. Yushchenko was poisoned during his presidential run and Russian agents were suspected but no concrete evidence was drawn between the two. Yanukovych threw his hat in the ring again for the 2010 presidential elections, and by all accounts won a fair election.  However, things began to turn badly for him again when he reverted the Ukrainian Constitution back to its 2004 draft where it re-strengthened the powers of the President, which had been amended by the previous office.  Further, he had run on a platform of opening better trade relations with the EU, something that the majority of Ukrainians seemed to be open to or at least entertain.  At the last minute he decided that he was going to have think more strongly about this as Russia had offered a new plan, called the Russian-Ukrainian action plan (there’s another name for it that includes Belarus and I think Kazakhstan, but I cannot remember it).  Essentially, this allowed stronger trade with Russia for cheaper gas to Ukraine.  This came in on the heels of the Ukrainian-Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas Treaty, that leased Crimea and Sevastopol to the Russians for another 25 years with the option to renew.  It came out later that the gas prices were becoming higher and higher over the years because Putin was upset at the “insane” price Ukraine wanted for the rental of the base.  This base was also dismissed by Russia as effectively useless anyways and not really needed, oh how times have changed and how Russia loves to play opposite day.


This brought about another protest, the Maidan Revolution in late 2013 and early 2014.  This is where hundreds of thousands of protestors took to the streets in Kyiv and occupied government buildings calling for Yanukovych to step down.  The protests turned violent and over 100 people were killed, civilians and police officers alike.  In fear, he stepped down and tried to flee to Russia, but was denied.  Then he sought protection in Crimea for a little bit before he was escorted out by Putin’s “little green men” that just so happened to be protecting the pro-Russian parts of Ukraine where separatists had begun claiming harm was being done to them.  This harm was believed to have been instigated by the Ukrainian government no longer recognizing Russian as an official language, something Yanukovych had implemented, and had now been voted out as an illegal/unnecessary act.  It stated that 10% of the population speaking the language would make it an official language.  For comparison, that means that Canada is 50% of the way there for making Chinese (all dialects) an official language of the country.  Further, these separatists began inciting infamous Ukrainian Stepan Bandera, who was a prominent polarizing figure, and stating these repeated overthrows of elected leaders were akin to his movements in the 1930s and 1940s.  


Bandera was/is still a controversial figure.  I will go on record for my own behalf and say that the guy was definitely a racist asshole, but not nearly as bad as Russia and pro-Russian people make him out to be.  His main goal was an independent Ukraine, and to do that, he saw a complete separation of Ukraine from Moscow, who he believed was enemy number 1.  In order to do this, he caught the attention of the Germans and they, in part via the SS and Gestapo, helped his movement.  Primarily, because Bandera saw any pro-Russian people a threat and wanted them out of Ukraine, this included Poles and Jews, and of course ethnic Russians.  The Gestapo apparently didn’t agree with this completely and threw him in a camp.  During his internment there his group killed a lot of Polish, Jewish, and Russian people, with estimates between 900 to over several thousand.  Some argue he is not responsible for this since he was in a concentration camp, while others, and myself included, think that just because he was not directly involved in the killing does not mean he is not at least partially responsible.  Sometime towards the end of the war when the Germans were hightailing it back to home base, he was released.  Again, he started up an anti-Russia organization calling for an independent Ukraine free of Russia and called for the removal of all pro-Russian assets.  He even stated that over time the Germans had twisted his meaning to exterminate strictly Poles and Jews but he was advocating for the removal of only those sympathetic to Moscow, and anyone who was willing to fight for an independent Ukraine was okay.  I of course cannot verify most of these claims due to it being so many years later.",1650647386.0,1650641299.0,t3_u95nyv,t3_u95nyv,,0,-8,0,-8,1,0,

In 1966 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison an experiment was staged involving five monkeys in a large cage. In the middle of the cage, a ladder was placed leading up to some hanging bananas. As the experiment began, one monkey spotted the food and began climbing the ladder.  As he did, however, the researcher, Gordon Stephenson, sprayed him with a stream of cold water. He then turned to all the other monkeys in the cage and sprayed each and every one of them as well. The monkey on the ladder scrambled away without a banana and now all five monkeys were left cold and wet. Nevertheless, after a while, banana temptation beckoned and another monkey attempted to climb the ladder. And once again, the researcher sprayed the adventurous monkey on the ladder as well as each of his cage-mates. What happened next was surprising to the researcher but not wholly unexpected.

When a third monkey attempted to ascend the ladder, the other monkeys, realized that what came next was cold water for all of them. They wanted to avoid this discomfort. Apparently when monkeys are aware that discomfort is imminent, they may not pause to “use their words” … they cuff, thwack, pummel and drub until the errant monkey gets the message. The monkey climbing the ladder was thus pulled off and educated by the other monkeys.

The second part of the experiment involved removing one monkey and replacing it with a new monkey. As would be expected of the newcomer, upon spotting the bananas, he naively began to climb the ladder. And just like the last climber, the other monkeys pulled him off and schooled him.

Here’s where it got interesting: The researcher removed a second one of the original monkeys from the cage and replaced him with a new monkey. Again, the new monkey went for the bananas and, again, the other monkeys prevented him from climbing to the bananas – including the monkey who had never been sprayed.

By the end of the experiment, none of the original monkeys were left and yet, despite none of them ever experiencing the cold, wet, spray, they had all learned never to try and go for the bananas.",False,1650635914.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5qrltj,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

The sun rose over Azov

The wind blows over the dunes

It's cold, but the sand smells like spring

The eyes are already used to fatigue

Too many reasons

I dream of how good we will be with you again



No, ship's guns

They will not break my dream

My heart will never betray faith

Will stand to age

The righteous city of Mary

Docks over the proud Azov

The sun rises



The sky thunders over Azov

The enemy is firing cannons

In the evening, even the concrete smells of war

Think about what tomorrow will be like

There is no time and no reason

Heart and hands have long been accustomed to fighting



And ship guns

They will not break my dream

My heart will never betray faith

Will stand to age

The righteous city of Mary

Docks over the proud Azov

The sun rises



We remained ourselves

We wrapped up in the night

And his free mouth tightened in pain

But also in the deepest basements

The light will come back again

The cry of a new day breaks free



And ship guns

They will not break my dream

My heart will never betray faith

Will stand to age

The righteous city of Mary

Docks over the proud Azov

Let's not forget that there were many companies who only pulled out of Russia because their customers got too loud with complaining - if the consumers had not complained, they wouldn't have voluntarily done so. 

What I want to come out of this, hopefully, are a few things. I want Europe to become more energy sufficient, especially with renewables - wind, solar, hydro etc. Idk if they have to pay grants to speed the process or if they have to offer tax incentives to do it, I know they want to get rid of new combustion-engine cars from being sold some 2030 I think - maybe they should offer a grant for every car purchased by an individual or something to speed up the process. I also want Europe to finally understand that talking about values and morals is nice, but only talk means nothing if you cannot have teeth to go with your words. Europe needs to look the truth in the face and acknowledge that sometimes the only way to deal with threats is with force and an army - doesn't mean you engage in something, but it sure means you should have the capability and readiness. 

And I also want some proper reckoning from the EU. We were right, here on the eastern side. We may be small in size and population, but for once we knew better than most of the major powers in Europe and we were not listened to.

>**Bakery Oven HPK 50 M2**  
The bakery oven is intended for baking of bread and other confectionery, it maybe used for drying of various products. It can be operated both in stationary and in field conditions. The oven works on firm fuel (firewood, coal), and at liquid fuel (diesel fuel, kerosene), or from the electric power (with installation of heaters in the furnace camera). Uniqueness of the oven consists in the fact that movement of forms (baking sheets) in the baking camera provides a uniform technological mode in the process of products’ baking. It is possible due to existence of rotor type of the conveyor with a horizontal axis of rotation and a rotary motion of cradles with forms concerning pipes on which they are mounted on the conveyor. The oven is reliable and convenient in operation; it is supplied with a temperature regulator. Quantity of the grain forms are 108, they are established on 9 cradles (at baking of bread weighing 1,7 kg.) The oven has a water-heating tank. For civil application it is delivered on a frame. During the three-shift work the payback period of the oven would be 3 months. Steam humidification is absent. The design of the oven provides normal baking of bread. Internal size of swinging shelf: 1746 х 23 х 28 Size of the oven 3200 х 2000 х 1800

She saw a little girl's head, neatly severed at the neck, covered in blood, the face quite unrecognisable as human. The streamers she had seen flapping about, were two plaits that might once have been blonde but were now caked with blood and dirt. One Russian picked it up by the plaits and threw it to his comrade who continued the game.""

Where her eyes used to be, were two blood encrusted holes, where he had driven his knife in. Her throat had been cut and there was a large pool of blood where her head had almost been severed.""

He even went on to boast that ""two million of our children were born"" in Germany.

If you read academic literature about the theories of peace, especially in Europe post-WWII, quite a lot of it refers to a theory in which economic interdependency has played a key role in reducing conflicts. If we're all too connected and all have a lot to lose, then the likelihood of us getting into a war is lessened according to that theory.

That said, I think the West decided to ignore the creeping ruthlessness of Russia and opted to continue doing business as usual, even when signs were emerging that Russia wasn't interested in European-style leadership. Furthermore, I think Europe let itself be humiliated and mocked by Russia and either chose to ignore it or didn't even see that it was being actually mocked. Like when Merkel went to meet Putin and Putin brought in a huge dog (Merkel is afraid of dogs), or when Putin made some EU people wait for 1-2 hours until he decided to show up.

Putin thinks that the West, but especially the EU, is weak and easy to buy. And we almost showed him that we are weak and easy to buy and be paid off. It was a mistake not to react sooner and more strongly, to add actual force behind our ""we strongly condemn"" and ""we are alarmed"". We showed Russia that we were willing to let them into the stuff they wanted to be in (WTO for example), but Russia didn't show a change on its side - we should've taken notice back then and reacted appropriately.

Both countries find it beneficial for the world order to change to a multipolar framework for their own interests, and both countries have near term aims that don't harm those of the other. Russia going for Ukraine doesn't have a significant impact on China's designs for Taiwan or Southeast Asia and vice versa. 

The tension between these two countries after the fall of the Soviet Union was more that Russia saw itself as the senior partner in the relationship, which China refused to acknowledge.

1). Attrition: The Russians aren't just sitting around and not targetting Ukrainian artillery. They know they need to knock it out to advance on them. Zelensky and his military leaders know that their systems will be gradually chewed up in time. Such is war. 

2). Quality: Zelensky is looking to upgrade the quality of his Soviet style artillery. Although integrating drones for the sake of accuracy has helped improve the effectiveness of the existing artillery, he wants technological advantage over the Russians, by being able to out range them, with more accurate, sophisticated systems that more maneuvrable and portable. Ukraine needs the ability to remain nimble and to be able to react quickly to Russian movement and surges. Western Artillery will give them that option. 

3). Ammunition: The burn rate for artillery rounds and rockets is insane. All of his artillery uses Russian style, 152mm rounds, of which their are limited capacities in Eastern Europe. The West uses 155mm rounds, of which many Western nations (especially Britain, Germany and the United States) have copious amounts.

Examples built for the French Army use a Renault Sherpa 10 chassis, examples built for export utilize the 6x6 Unimog U2450L chassis. The CAESAR platform was developed by the former GIAT Industries (now known as Nexter) and is operated by the Danish, French, Indonesian, Saudi Arabian and Thai militaries.

**A few of the shit points to help break it down...**

There are no reliable indicators that there are 100k troops from Syria and Libya... Do they even know how long that would take to transport via air?

And if by land, we would have seen something on this over the last month or so.

My guess is it's a zeroes or troop source error. 1000, not 100000. Alternatively they mean troops in total, including redeployment from the north, but even then that number is likely overblown and hasn't accounted for attrition.


*Mariupol has taken on outsize importance in the war. Capturing it would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port and complete a land corridor between Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Putin seized from Ukraine in 2014.*

Nope, it hasn't, it's been a PR importance, that's all.

The ability to use the port has been denied since the start, thus it's a pointless remark. It has already been deprived.

The land corridor already exists and has for a long time, since Russia took over a large portion of the city.


*It would also enable Putin to throw more of his forces into the potentially climactic battle for the Donbas and its coal mines, factories and other industries, or what the Kremlin has now declared to be its main objective.*

Partially true. It does free up additional troops but how much this will influence the battle is in question.

There is no other choice. If Ukraine falls, it's more likely than ever that Putin or his successor will continue. If he can sell this as a huge victory at home, then that's what they will do. 

I keep repeating it, but there is a reason why CEE countries look to NATO and US to protect them and not EU/Germany.

If Germany cuts off Russian gas, there's no immediate replacement, and suddenly the strongest economy in the EU's industry grinds to a halt, and their exports crater.

If the banking industry in some of the smaller, southern EU states tumbling nearly caused the EU to break up during a period of growth, then you're welcome to imagine what the lack of exports and a recession in the economy propping everyone else up would cause during a period of inflation and already low interest rates.

correct. Ukraine estimated this amount and Russia confirmed this

based on conventional and basic military death rates since ww1, we can estimate a 1:3 kia to wounded ratio. this would mean 20k killed, and approximately 60k wounded, for a total of loss of 80k troops in their invasion force.

One of the factors I believe missed in your analysis--not that it is in *any way* unsound, just, sort of something that should be added--is that there's a difference between a Ukranian and a Russian reservist, more so than their existing fighting forces in the field.

A Russian reservist is usually an ex-conscript (1-2 years of training, unmotivated).  Before this all kicked off, Ukraine ran their reserve system like the allies ran fighter pilots in WW2, where they used the Donbass to farm experience, rotating out people for months at a time then to the reserves (est: 200k reservists with combat experience).

Many of the people coming to fight for Ukraine are Western vets of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, etc.  Now, *definitely not all*, but a good chunk come well-equipped and with combat experience (20-30k).  OTOH those coming from third world nations for Russia, in far smaller numbers (2-3k?), are of questionable value & loyalty.

So when the Ukranian Army ""calls up the reserves"", it has highly-motivated troops, a bit rusty but with hands-on experience.  When the Russian Army ""calls up the reserves"", it's conscripts who don't want to be there and may not even speak the language, or conscripted Ukranians and foreigners who *really* don't want to be there.

All Ukraine has to do once they halt any major offensive is just wait until the Russians are bled out, and then mop up what remains, much like the disintegration north of Kyiv.  They have substantial armored & artillery forces and are growing stronger, and have maintained fighting cohesion and morale; while they aren't publishing much about their losses, OSINT estimates range for Ukrainian losses as being, although high for civilians, much, *much* lower for their military in personnel and materiel than the Russians, at about a 1:4 to 1:5 ratio with very high combat efficiency even in the attack.",False,1650604446.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5pmutl,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

They entered Ukraine with the intention of toppling the government and then holding on the what they had against largely toothless international protest. The army they committed to Ukraine was designed to keep a population under control. It was never designed to fight a peer enemy.

They never thought they were going to be in this situation where they would have to fight a proper army. They aren’t prepared for it. Russia doesn’t have the manpower or equipment to keep this up forever.

The other issue slowing things down right now is that Ukraine is currently rearming. It takes every different equipment to invade cities and defend land in flat open areas.

They can just part with the separatist republics they did not care about anyway.  :) Maybe Putin saw an inside job coming and needed to see who would offer resistance.  

I vaguely recall my high school world history teacher saying that the Russians botch the start of every big war.  I think it is safe to say historians will add 2022's special operation to the list.   The trend has not changed favorably for Russia.  The major difference is Russia as the aggressor.  They certainly failed the opening. 

Without knowing how much damage Ukraine is taking it is impossible to say how much longer they could fight. I ministry of defense numbers are accurate(unlikely) then they could keep it up for many years.  Running out of ammunition could rapidly deteriorate their front.  We also do not know how much ammunition they fired early in the war and without that information it is hard to guage how much it matters.  

I think the war was in Ukraine's favor as soon as it was announced that they really were going to fight.  Around the 3rd day or so.  Kyiv could have fallen and it may have taken many years of fighting to force the Russians out.  Never any good reason to doubt Ukraine would be independent of Moscow.

Negotiations do not appear to be succeeding, and the United States and its NATO allies are beginning to contemplate how they will make Russia pay should it press forward with an invasion. A real war is now a distinct possibility, which would have far-reaching consequences for everyone involved, especially Ukraine’s citizens.

The great tragedy is this entire affair was avoidable. Had the United States and its European allies not succumbed to hubris, wishful thinking, and liberal idealism and relied instead on realism’s core insights, the present crisis would not have occurred.

The Russians are too stupid to entrench. Russians are literally attacking into Ukrainian lines today. You can't be entrenched if you're charging into battle.

Russians literally think they're winning this war. They're not in a position (politically) to defend or consolidate their gains. This means more hassle for civilians in the short term, but it also means that Russian military strength will continue to decline day-after-day, attack-after-attack. That's the most hilarious part of this all, they've bought into their own propaganda.

Ukraine needs to hold on as long as they can for Western heavy weapons to reach their quickly mobilizing army. I don't know when Ukraine will be ready for a counter-offensive, but it makes sense to wait for Russian strength to defeat itself before making a real offensive push.

A bit on topic with this is understanding the difference between bias, hyperbole and propaganda.

Many folks just dismiss biased or hyperbolic media as propaganda, sometimes that's true but more often it's just bias, hyperbole or poor reporting.

Bias - portraying facts/story in a certain way, rather than objectively, often picking the more favourable figures or sources.

Hyperbole - overblowing the value or meaning of certain facts or reports, often to garner more views.

Propaganda - deliberate misreporting or misinformation to support an agenda.

As near as I can tell, most reports coming out of Ukraine have a Bias and some have strong Hyperbole but not many are propaganda. 

Russian reporting is blatantly (at least 90%) propaganda. They completely misreport and make up things to support the government narrative.

The Ukrainian Government and media haven't been overly propagandist, more biased than anything. I think they genuinely believe their casualty rates and certain tidbits from other sources have at times backed up their numbers.

1acc342a7253a2b5f573d5fb0e73ba02,u95nyv,i5t3s1h,"1.  AT Weapons (Anti Tank)  
Some of the most impactful weapons are Anti tank weapons. In particular man portable ATGMS (Anti Tank Guided Missiles) such weapons include the NLAW, Javelin, etc... I know its obvious and talked about constantly but its important none the less.   


Russia's Doctrine focuses around Armored/Mechanized warfare and a style of battle called Deep Battle Doctrine. This involves large scale maneuver's designed to encircle and trap enemy units while also allowing other units to push ahead simultaneously.  


[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep\_operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_operation) :If you wish to read more about their doctrine...  


Anyways man portable missile systems are easy to conceal and since they are carried by infantry they are highly mobile and able to operate in virtually any environment. This gives the Ukrainian armed forces a high degree of flexibility allowing them to spread their forces out more, and cover more ground. It also renders Russia's large tank units more or less useless as their armor advantage is negated.  


2. Dedicated large AA platforms such as SAM's (Surface to air Missiles)  


SAM's like S-300's and other large and long-medium ranged Air defense platforms allow Ukraine to nullify Russia's airpower advantage while simultaneously allowing their own still existing air force to perform more operations.  


Removing Russian airpower has proven highly destructive to their operations and makes ground operations in particular a significantly more dangerous and more costly endeavor.  


Longer range AA also prevents attacks from standoff munitions like Cruise missiles which keeps more of Ukraine intact and thus able to provide for the war effort.   


3. Drones of just about any type.  


Drones are non manpower intensive, relatively cheap compared to other air assets, and are often multirole allowing them to do a wide variety of operations. In particular drones with surveillance and destructive capabilities would be very useful like the Turkish Bayraktar (Surveillance and strike) and the switchblade 300/600 (Strike and Anti personnel/armor).  


4. Artillery (again of just about any type)  


Artillery pieces while not specifically accurate can slow down an enemy's advance and force their units to dig in. They can also be used both defensively and offensively which gives the Ukrainian army more options for field operations.  


5. Really just about anything...  


I know it seems like this is a joke one. But really the best thing we can do is give Ukraine anything they can use. Guns, ammo, food, water, vehicles, drones. If it can be used in war it should be sent. The longer Russia is bogged down the more difficult they will find it to replace losses and the more likely their economy will enter free fall.  


Russia can't fight indefinitely short of declaring full scale war and mobilization which would be a massive loss Politically for the Kremlin and would make Putin VERY unpopular amongst Russian's. Even so its unlikely their defense industry would be able to keep up and ultimately they would run dry and die.

483646240eccca7d981f9d1525c60fc4,u95nyv,i5rd83p,"Cycling back to the present, the pro-Russian separatists viewed these government overhauls as movements similar to the “Nazification” of Ukraine in the 1930s and 1940s.  In reality, as is true for many other things, the situation is a lot muddier.  Did some Poles, Jews, and Russians die at his call?  Absolutely they did, but was Bandera’s movement seeking to completely eradicate all Polish, Jewish, and Russian citizens from the planet?  No.  He wanted a free and independent Ukraine, free of Russia and Stalin’s grasp, that had treated it like dog shit for decades.  Polling has shown that a very negative view of Bandera slides uniformly from the east to the west, where in places like Lviv, Bandera in a large minority (~35%) consider him a Ukrainian hero, while in the south and east, close to 50% of the population saw him as an extremely negative figure.  This is not surprising, given that the majority of Russian speakers in Ukraine live in the south and east.  The separatists, during the Maidan Revolution, reached out to the Kremlin, and apparently Putin personally, as he was friends with the Prime Minister of Donetsk, to help as they feared they were going to be purged as had happened 65-70 years previously.  This started the war in the DNR 8 years ago and eventually amounted to Russia taking over Crimea and supporting these independent separatist states.  


During the most recent war (pre-2022), Russia went full force “Ukraine = Nazi”, while claiming they had found evidence of genocide against Russian speakers in these regions.  None of it has been internationally verified.  These include forced removal of citizens, mass graves, and the like.  Several documentaries from these pro-Russian regions have popped up.  I have not watched them, but I have read that they contain very loose, anecdotal evidence in support of the “genocide” of Russians by Ukrainians.  This of course also went full force with Ukraine adopting the Azov Battalion into its militia.  It is important to point out here that Azov as a political movement is a fundamentally different thing than Azov the militia.  The Azov movement, that was a nationalist movement, had very few elected seats in government and would be about the political equivalent of the Tea Party in terms of influence.  Sure, they might get a seat or two, but they are not in any form strong enough to change anything or be influential enough to sway votes away from the major parties.  The Azov Battalion saw the threat the pro-Russian separatists faced and took arms against them to protect the rest of Ukraine.  The Russian bot farms went into overdrive when militia groups cut power and water supplies to Crimea, claiming war crimes, genocide, and Nazism.  Was that a cool thing to do?  Absolutely not.  However, you have to remember, Crimea held a supposed referendum where 95% of the population there voted to be part of Russia.  In that case, I can sort of see the Ukrainian militia’s point, that why should they continue to supply power and water to a country that isn’t even theirs and was illegally removed from their country. The Russians control it, they need to step up and act like daddy. Further “genocide” was cried when the militia blocked food, water, and clothes from going into the separatist held east, with the UN claiming it was impossible to get the supplies to the people.  The Ukrainians doubled down and said they had no issues with the humanitarian aid, they welcomed it, but had noticed that the separatists were taking the food for and water for themselves, or selling it at insane prices to the residents, making sure it never made it to the people it was supposed to help.  In short, the Ukrainian militia did some not cool things, but it can almost be viewed as justified in the larger picture when you realize that they were supporting a state that actively did not want to be associated with them and were then giving food and supplies to illegal occupiers that was not going to the citizens they wanted to help.


Additionally, it needs to be pointed out now that while the Azov political movement and Azov Battalion definitely had some nationalist tendencies, Russia claiming that is the reason for going in is very pot calling the kettle black.  For almost a decade that I am aware of (and it is likely much longer than this), Russia has supported the work of the paramilitary group, the Wagner Group, to do their dirty work.  A group that has been proven to be run by a neo-Nazi.  Another group, the Russian Imperial Movement, has been supplying troops and training to the separatists in the east, where neo-Nazis and white supremacists from across Europe and the US are trained in insurgency tactics and funneled into Ukraine to “fight the Nazi Azov”.  Kirill Kolchin worked for Russia at the UN, and has been associated with a pro-Nazi group, the Old School Skins, and neo-Nazi Rinaldo Nazzaro who created a US terrorist group, The Base, moved to and operates out of Russia currently.
In summary, the “de-nazification” of Ukraine is a terribly falsified movement by the Kremlin to justify an invasion.  It can be essentially boiled down to the Russian definition of Nazi is equivalent to anyone who dislikes Russia for any reason whatsoever.  They are shocked that Ukrainian children are not fluent in Russian but do not recognize any other official languages apart their own.  Putin has gone on video stating that Ukraine cannot exist and is not real, but anything he deems as an existential threat to Russia, even loosely, is threatened with extreme escalation.  In short, my old friend is completely brainwashed, and I can safely say now, an idiot, for believing any of this pro-Russia BS about saving Ukraine from being turned fascist from within.

Asia Defense Politics has good maps, though they tend to lean towards Russia for the benefit of the doubt. They also have YouTube videos regularly. However, their take on certain war crimes is pretty bad, so I would just follow their military analysis.

Jomini of the West on Twitter and Militaryland.net have very detailed maps that are updated daily for ML and periodically for Jomini. But only maps, no news.

3. Is the price worth it for the lives that would be saved? This imo is the crucial question simply because lives are worth a fuck of a lot 
4. Even if 3. is answered affirmatively, is there a strong possibility of a significantly better outcome?

Giving Chom (and some others) the benefit of the doubt, and assuming Russia would accept such a settlement (doubtful) the issue almost boils down to: do the long-term risks to Ukrainians of a settlement (basically becoming a Russian satellite) outweigh the short-term costs (mostly in lives).

Also: if peace were achievable at such a cost, would it be possible to nonetheless ensure Russia's long-term diminishment as a threat via military sorry for Ukraine? This is absolutely not the case - forced neutrality means giving up the possibility of future resistance. That's untenable. 

Apart from the always hard question of whether lives lost now are worth it, the only thing I would be thinking about, if I were Ukrainian, is whether there is a scenario in which an apparent capitulation of this type could be reliably followed by a demilitarised Russia and the prospect of fundamental changes to the system there - via continuing economic pressure.

In our evening news, they showed Ukrainians crossing the border from Russia into Estonia, majority having escaped/taken from Mariupol. One man said that they were taken to somewhere nearby in Russia with buses, lots of buses full of people, sheltered somewhere for a few days and then given an option to take a ""free"" train to somewhere in Russia or pay for their own ticket. He said that those who do have money left over and have ""relatives"" in somewhere nearby (basically lying that they have relatives nearby Moscow/St Petersburg in order to have a reason to leave and come nearby north-west area) take their own train to Moscow and St Petersburg where they then hope to move to a border area and cross into EU. According to that one guy, most people on their train from there to north-west were ukrainians wanting to leave, but that there were lots and lots more who took the ""free"" trains because they didn't have any money. 

They said that also that information is spread in internet and social media, incl the phone number of our emergency services, which gets calls about whether or not ukrainians can actually cross the EU border with their documentation, which may lack an international passport etc. 

Honestly, I wouldn't put it past them to actually move that many people. Anybody who says that Russia cannot get its own supplies and vehicles on the front is mistaken when they think that they cannot move so many people to other parts of Russia via trains - much easier to pack trains full of people than to move vehicles etc, especially if the people have already escaped into Russia nearby Mariupol from the shelling and bombing (the interviewees here said that they couldn't get to Ukrainian side so had to go to Russian side).",False,1650610182.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5pujcj,,2,40,0,40,0,0,

 >A settlement hierarchy is a way of arranging settlements into a hierarchy based upon their population or some other criteria. The term is used by landscape historians and in the National Curriculum for England. The term is also used in the planning system for the UK and for some other countries such as Ireland, India, and Switzerland. The term was used without comment by the geographer Brian Roberts in 1972.

There is no clear way to know exactly how many people would die in a Russia Vs NATO nuclear war, but definitely not to the scale of ""Nobody survivng"" even within Europe/US/Russia most people would survive a nuclear war, the initial blasts would kill tens of millions, and the fallout could easily kill 100 million more. But that would still leave the better part of a billion humans alive, the radiation would clear quite quickly too. Only a few weeks until places that had been bombed could begin to be resettled. 

More people would die due to total breakdown of the the regions economy and food supply, and if a war followed the nuclear bombs than even more people still. A horrific number of people, maybe as high as 50% or more would die, but once again no where near ""nobody would survive"" and this is only in regards to NA, EU and Russia.

But Canada is so big we'd be fine.  Of course we are a NATO country and we have NORAD which is a great deterrent so that's going to halt them. But pretend it didn't and our partners stayed out of it, they'd have to come over the Pacific for an amphibious attack on BC. If they did get onshore in Vancouver,  which sits on a thin wedge of coast, they'd hit 5 (?) million people with and have no equipment or sufficient troops to do anything. Othereise BC is extreme mountains, sparsely populated and easily defended. When I say easy I mean it. It'd be a turkey shoot. Or they come through Alaska and America truly fucks them up. 

Then they can come over the Arctic I guess but there's nothing up there anyhow except tundra, muskeg, and so many blackflies and mosquitos they wouldn't get far. They'd have to travel thousands on km through extreme wilderness to get to a town to shoot anything. That's even if they can *get to* Canada over the Arctic because that's some extreme stuff its so extreme it just wouldn't happen.  
I think we have enough of a navy to hold them off in the East (I'm guessing)and they can't come at us in the East easily thats a long route from Russia. 

So we are good as far as naive me thinks. 

But for those nukes. But realistically the whole world is fucked if anyone drops a nuke.


So we are safe.   It's  a 0 out of 10.

Any, significant, Ukrainian counter offensive of scale will take place later in the year, when they've stalled Russia's offensive.

I suspect that you'll start seeing the artillery show up on the battlefield within a month's time, but I doubt you'll see it in any mass quantities, for several months.

That's not only true of artillery, but also of the drones being sent, the anti-aircraft systems such as Starstreak and Mistrial being sent, and even the armored vehicles that are much different than the Soviet style things that Ukraine is using now. 

The plan is, obviously, to keep the Eastern European weapons systems that the Ukrainians already know, filtering into Ukraine to supplement their shirt term losses. That's why the Polish and Czech T72's are so neccessary, for example, as well as finding 152mm ammunition and GRAD rockets, for their current artillery and standard ammunition for their small arms weaponry.

>I mean, Czechia, Slovakia, Poland, Baltics all really, really hate Russia. Have people forgotten happened in 1956?

Post 1956 things weren't that bad here in Hungary, it was probably the nicest place in the communist block, so a lot of old people are actually nostalgic about that era. Because of that people don't really hate Russians that much. Even my parents who are only in their 50s look back to that era as ""simpler, happier times"". 

>hat is the issue with the Hungarian minority in Ukraine? Is there some bad blood between them and ethnic Ukrainians?

I don't know all that much about what's going on with the Hungarians in Ukraine, but one of the major issues was forcing them to use Ukrainian as the primary language in schools. There were a couple of smaller incidents too.

>Is Orban's BS really popular in Hungary?

On reddit you'll only hear the worst things about Orban and Hungary in general, so while I wanted the opposition to win, it's really not a black and white issue. The opposition was a Frankenstein's monster of a coalition, there was no way they could have agreed on anything if they managed to win the election. Greens, socialists, liberals, ex-far right people, pretty much everyone else. It was basically a choice between having a functioning government for the next 4 years or not. 

I don't like Orban and the nationalistic and religious ideas he's pushing, but he's not nearly as bas as reddit would have you believe. He's not a Putin wannabe dictator. (Not yet, at least.) He's not imprisoning gay people, he's not trying to take Hungary out of the EU, etc. 

It's also not true that Orban is supporting Putin, which I saw repeated a lot of times. He condemned this invasion from day 1 and continued to do so ever since. You won't hear that here though.

Russia has about 800 strategic warheads deployed on about 300 ICBMs, very few if any of which carry 10 warheads.   Their new Sarmat launcher will be capable of carrying 10 warheads, but it hasn't been deployed yet. (It made its first test flight *yesterday*.)

Each US ballistic missile submarine (and there are 14 of them) carries 24 Trident SLBMs, each with 8-12 MIRV'ed warheads.

 >The Wendelstein 7-X (abbreviated W7-X) reactor is an experimental stellarator built in Greifswald, Germany, by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), and completed in October 2015. Its purpose is to advance stellarator technology: though this experimental reactor will not produce electricity, it is used to evaluate the main components of a future fusion power plant; it was developed based on the predecessor Wendelstein 7-AS experimental reactor. As of 2015, the Wendelstein 7-X reactor is the largest stellarator device.
 
**[ITER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER)** 
 
 >ITER (initially the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, iter meaning ""the way"" or ""the path"" in Latin) is an international nuclear fusion research and engineering megaproject aimed at replicating the fusion processes of the Sun to create energy on the Earth. Upon completion of construction of the main reactor and first plasma, planned for late 2025, it will be the world's largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment and the largest experimental tokamak nuclear fusion reactor. It is being built next to the Cadarache facility in southern France.

What he continues to fail to understand is committing genocide against the Ukrainian people doesn’t break their will to resist, instead they make it crystal clear to Ukrainians how dangerous Putin is to them in an existential way. It is completely unacceptable Ukrainian territorial integrity is not fully restored. 

Zelenskyy has reiterated this point repeatedly as well as stated any peace accord would be subject to the approval of the Ukrainian people. I would be willing to bet the vast majority of Ukrainians will reject any peace accord that does not remove the Russians from all occupied Ukrainian regions including the separatist regions as well as the Crimea. That poses a serious problem for Putin even for his diminished phase 2 revised war objectives. Moreover, Putin will not be able to “win” phase 2 because he can’t hold those territories even if his army can succeed in its eastern Ukraine offensive (something that is quite uncertain currently), Putin simply does not have enough manpower (especially not without a general mobilization) and the Ukrainians will not “give” him a “win” because of his acts of genocide. 

To compound Putin’s problems further, he is running out of time. Putin can’t call up a general mobilization in time to save his ass because he doesn’t have the time to train and equip the new conscripts. Even IF Putin’s fairy god mother waved her wand and by some miracle he got his conscripts (without a social revolution in Russia), his already logistically challenged army will literally collapse from the logistical burden of a large green, largely poorly equipped, conscript army.

Tank rounds, Shells, and Bombs are cheap. Really really cheap. A lot of people don't seem to understand just how cheap the munitions are that cause this kind of destruction.

What's more important though, is the logistical challenge and logistics involved in moving those weapons all over the place. If Russia wants to shoot 500-shells into a neighborhood, the Russia needs to send a truck with 500-shells on it to the artillery system.

That truck is vulnerable to Ukrainian fighters in a variety of ways (direct attacks, drones, tanks, artillery).

That's where the Ukrainians can punish Russia. Destroy the delivery mechanisms, destroy Russia's ability to supply those guns, and Russia will be forced to retreat.

--------

But no. Russia is barely spending a dime on these dumb bombs / dumb munitions when they destroy neighborhoods. They have more than enough money / dumb bombs to level all of Ukraine if they wanted to, and rebuild those bombs in time for the next conflict.

What we should celebrate is Russia's use of smart-weapons / guided bombs. Its clear that Russia is facing a semiconductor shortage and has limited capacity to rebuild smart-weapons. Each cruise missile or guided ballistic used is one that Russia likely can't replace.

I wonder what Russia's actual ratio is. 1:3 kinda assumes you're doing the most you can to take care of wounded. Russia so far doesn't really have a stellar track record at taking care or caring about their troops. 

I've even seen a few reports / recorded calls where Russian soldiers claimed Russia has executed their own wounded to avoid having to deal with em.

Furthermore, the 3 to 1 injured to killed ratio assumes that active attempts were being made to evacuate the wounded and not allow them to become KIAs. I believe, what we've seen from the Russians at this point, is that they allowed a lot of wounded men, to become KIAs due to horrendous logistics and ability to evacuate their injured, early in the war. 

I suspect that as the war wears on, fronts are established and logistics line are created and defended, the war will fall more in line with the 3 to 1 injured to killed ratio you're referring to, but I think the Russians had more KIAs and fewer injured early on, due to the nature of their operations.

Also the US heavily supports Saudi Arabia, so some sort of violent take over would probably not go over well. Look at the Iranian Revolution and the events that led up to it if you want an idea. 

>Why is Xi still in power in China?

China isn't as brutally repressive as some people think. They are certainly quite authoritarian but life under Xi Jinping isn't that awful for your average Chinese person. In fact if you're Chinese and not from Hong Kong, your life has probably been made better during Xi's time in power.

Putin came to power during peaceful times, and people in Russia still remember democracy and freedom of speech. And, nominally, it's still a democracy and they have multiple political parties. AFAIK multiple parties do not exist even on paper in countries you mentioned.

So it would be orders of magnitude easier for Russians to conceptualize a change of regime. Compare being born into a system where the leader presumably has a god-given right to govern to personally witnessing a change of regime. Russians saw collapse of Soviet union, anti-putch uprising, constitutional crisis, etc. So they know that change of regime is definitely possible.

You could just as easily say the US if fascist because there are armed ""militias"" running around in the backwoods of Michigan saying very nationalistic and white supremacist view points.

The *biggest* thing is to look back further to the soviet union in the 50s. It had (barely) survived several wars and famines and now there was lots of empty real estate throughout the nation that needed filling. And despite the Soviet's supposed equality stance, they definitely favored Russians and Russian speaking people when deciding where to relocate citizens. So Russians were transplanted into places devastated by war and famine throughout the union. Specifically all over eastern europe. Fast forward a half a century and the soviet union collapses but all these Russian communities are now stuck in nations that aren't Russia. They *could* have assimilated into their new nations and become a part of their societies but language barriers, isolation, and lack of interconnectivity slowed down and hampered such measures. For logistical reasons local governments encouraged people to learn a common language (which wasn't Russian) and angered locals because of it.

And then Putin came around and needed reasons for imperial ambition. And conveniently he had one spread all over Eastern Europe thanks to 1960 soviet planners. Russian speaking communities all over Eastern Europe that have been wronged by their local countries need the protection of Russia (You might see some similar themes here to pre-ww2 Germany). And so the big bad super power had to protect her maligned people, even if they hadn't actually lived in Russia for generations.

""Officially, I have been in Ukraine for almost 2 months. For me and my peers, it is as if 6 months have already passed. We are here as in another dimension. Events that occurred two weeks ago are already far away in our thoughts.  
  
People have no idea the level of stress soldiers at the front are under. Even when there is no immediate danger, just approaching the unknown and mortal danger creates enormous psychological pressure. Not to mention that at any time, death can strike. Already, many volunteers and soldiers have given up. Many left home in tears. Nobody judges them, because we all have a limit. On the contrary, we are all respectful of each other's efforts. Judgments and criticisms are only directed at those who were arrogant and chickened out. These do not garner respect from their peers.  
  
Imagine watching a comedian take the stage. For you, there is nothing stressful. But being THE ONE who walks on stage, feels the stage fright, is blinded by the spotlight, and still has to perform, is a whole different experience. Only those who have experienced something similar can understand.

So what is t(tank0) ? with the current rate of destruction maybe 1 month.  


Now, of course Russia has more tanks. So let's think about this like

\- number of available Russian tanks 

\- number of operational tanks (estimated 20%)

\- number of operational tanks that could potentially be deployed to Ukraine

\- number of operational tanks that are/were deployed to Ukraine  


But even the t(tank0) of potential tanks will be less than one year.  


You can do the same with troops. 20 000 in two months, so how much time left until 200 000 soldiers are dead. Answer: a bit more than a year and a half. Now, of course that is nonsense, because we forgot the wounded which you could estimate 3-4 times higher than the dead. A better estimate is that Russia has a maximum of 6 months unless all of the troops it originally deployed are unoperational.

The Social Democrats and the catholic minority had persistently resisted and wrestled a lot of concessions out of the aristocracy. The Reichstag had lively debates and real influence. 

And it’s not like the path of the Weimar  Republic was predetermined. It survived an intense period that can only describes as one step removed from full blown civil war, the occupation of the Rheinland, a total collapse of its currency, the Putsch of reactionary elites as well as the insurgency of the Red Army of the Ruhr. By the early to mid 20s, it was established and even the reactionary elites begrudgingly started to accept it as a fait accompli. It’s foreign policy under Streeseman was incredibly successful. It solved the reparation issue, brought Germany into the League of Nations, and normalized relationships with the Entente.  

There is no reason to believe that democracy would have imploded due to autocratic traditions without the Great Recession. And there is little reason to believe that democracies  without a long autocratic tradition would have fared that much better.

In 1980, the F/A-18 was selected as the winner of the New Fighter Aircraft Project competition and awarded a production order; deliveries of the CF-18 to the Canadian Armed Forces began in 1982. CF-18s have supported North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) air sovereignty patrols and participated in combat during the Gulf War in 1991, the Kosovo War in the late 1990s, and as part of the Canadian contribution to the international Libyan no-fly zone in 2011.

Canada is absolutely enormous and filled with more fresh water than anywhere else in the world, as many or more trees as any where in the world, the Canadian shield and the Rocky Mountains.

And that's only through the most populated provinces. You wouldn't even be close to the North in that scenario. 

Then you would arrive at the cities. An invasion from the West would see you have go go through fortified positions in Vancouver on the coast, with several million people, followed by Calgary / Edmonton as you drove through The Rocky Mountain range. Then you'd have to drive 13 hours before a million more people in Edmonton, before you reached the single lane highways and forests in Northern Ontario, which would be a death trap all the way down to Toronto and the GTA, home to 7 million more people. After all that, you'd finally be able to get to Ottawa (another million people).... And you'd still have damn near half the country to conquer with all of Quebec and the Maritimes. 

You could bring a million strong army across the Pacific and try to invade Canada. Canadians are absolutely armed to the teeth with long rifles and millions of miles of forest to hunt you down in.

Eh, not really. They definitely could still be lugging them around somewhere, just, I don't think these specific ovens are it. I *do* find it kind of surprising that we haven't seen any yet, but there's a lot we won't see for a long time or even ever. I think if they were in active use though, we would likely see the thermal hotspots from satellite imagery. It takes a *lot* to burn a body, both in terms of heat and time.    
  
>what are the implications of this, given Zelensky and the Mariupol mayor would’ve been lying/mistaken when they claimed that the Russians were burning bodies to hide true numbers of civilian/soldier deaths or sending witnesses to screening camps to be found and then killed? 

I don't know that they *are* lying or wrong, but it would be very inefficient for hiding mass amounts of people. It takes about [2-3](https://blog.martinoakscemeteryandcrematory.com/long-take-cremate-body/) hours at 1400-1800F to cremate a body, so in 24 hours operating continously they would be able to hide 8-12 bodies each. That's a lot of fuel to be using continously, it seems more likely that they would cart off the bodies to a fixed crematorium with the infrastructure to handle it (i.e fuel lines), or use mass graves like we've seen in Manhush. That's not to say they aren't using *any* mobile crematoriums, but maybe they'd reserve those for specific people whose bodies should never be found or even photographed in transit to a serious crematorium, like political targets.  
  
>it’d be a shockingly inefficient use of fuel to burn thousands of bodies like that…
    
Exactly this. Using ovens for bread at least feeds people (cynic in me thinks themselves more than citizens, despite their PR attempts with what may very well be stolen wheat), it's not really fuel they can afford to be using on thousands when they still need to eat. That doesn't mean they definitely aren't using any of them though, it would just be very tough to do covertly at a mass scale for the reasons outlined above",1650635492.0,1650634102.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5qpcm1,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

WASHINGTON, April 22 (Reuters) - Canada's Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday said that it was impossible to collaborate with Russia in the G20, a group of countries that meets to discuss ways to foster global economic growth, as long as Moscow is waging war in Ukraine.

""The G20 can't function effectively with Russia at the table,"" Freeland said in a joint news conference with Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko in Washington, where G20 countries held talks on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings.

Because the war is undermining growth, ""Russia does not have a place at the table of countries who have come together to maintain global economic prosperity... You can't be a poacher and gamekeeper at the same time.""

Discord over Russia's presence has been on full display all week, with finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Canada, Britain and other Western countries walking out of meetings whenever Russian officials spoke. read more

The divisions have meant G20 finance ministers and central bank governors failed to agree on a communique stating areas of agreement on major issues such as debt relief for poor countries, the impacts of the war in Ukraine and climate change.

Another failure to issue a joint statement came at Thursday's IMF steering committee meeting, and it remained unclear whether the joint IMF-World Bank Development Committee would issue a communique on Friday. read more

Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, has made impassioned pleas on behalf of Ukraine since Russia invaded the country in late February. read more

On Thursday she directly addressed Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who joined an IMF meeting virtually, saying his participation was ""perverse and absurd"" since ""your war is making us poorer,"" according to a source. read more

The G20 includes Western countries that have accused Moscow of war crimes in Ukraine, as well as China, India, Indonesia and South Africa, which have not joined Western-led sanctions against Russia over the conflict.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory, but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.",False,1650666860.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5sytjx,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

It knows the relationships with longstanding allies like India are sunsetting, and it doesn't have the wherewithal or resources to try and do much more than exert influence in Central Asia right now. It also doesn't have much power in being able to limit China's rise at this point either.

It doesn't make sense to me for China to want a weak puppet Russia. A Russia that is a non-issue on the world stage means the US can rally its continental European allies to focus on China as well. It would also be susceptible to regime change, and while Putin and his would-be successors represent a known quantity, a revolution could well bring in a Western-friendly government, in which case China's land border with adversarial nations pretty much doubles. 

The original plan was probably to support a quick operation in Ukraine which would force NATO and the US in particular to sequester forces in Europe in service of its alliance commitments, which would distract from the long term US pivot towards Asia. Russia would be subject to sanctions, but it would get what it wanted vis-a-vis Ukraine, and the quick resolution of the war would probably mean some of these sanctions would never have happened, and China would be happy to fill the market niche in Russia from Western companies gradually being afraid to invest there. Instead, sanctions were much more severe than anticipated, Russia is not in any position to obtain a quick victory, and China itself is economically vulnerable because of its COVID outbreaks right now. 

And I don't think this argument would've ever been true in the '70s or '80s, which is when the Sino-Soviet split was at its height.

 >The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the No. 4 reactor in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, near the city of Pripyat in the north of the Ukrainian SSR in the Soviet Union. It is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history both in cost and casualties. It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents rated at seven—the maximum severity—on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.

There is considerable evidence from the North that this is not accurate.  Russian soldiers are being supplied with expired Chinese MREs and have been looting as much food as the can.  Yes, they have a lot of ammo, but outside of small arms, they have issues with having and maintaining equipment to fire it.

Where you're mistaken, is that the Russians are utterly failing at this concept. The opposite is happening: Ukrainians are digging in, while Russians are attacking into entrenched Ukrainian positions.

I think we're all right to be worried about Russians performing a good strategy with their superior numbers, training, and equipment. But for now, it seems like we can rely upon their idiotic strategy for at least the near-term future. Eventually, the Russians will stop being a dumbass over these military operations and actually do something (well, more ""something"" than just killing civilians, which Russians apparently are good at). 

But as long as the Ukrainian army stands to counter-attack Russian forces whenever the Russians commit atrocities like that, the Russian army will just get weaker-and-weaker with each passing atrocity.

-------

The general idea is to _defeat_ the enemy military **before** killing civilians / causing atrocities. Otherwise, Russians are just pissing off the Ukrainian military even more and making the Ukrainian military fight harder. The Russian strategy is just fundamentally backwards and flawed.

As long as the Ukrainian Army can march and maneuver, they can do something about it.

All wars have logistics columns, but do you think that specifically maps onto the column to Kyiv and what happened there apart from both being logistics columns?

> Yeah, no naval action in Texas.

Yes there was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texian_Navy

> _Other than the commissioning of privateers, the Texan government agreed to authorize the purchase of four schooners on November 24, 1835, for use in defending territorial waters. The first of the ships acquired was the former revenue service ship USRC Ingham, a small six-gun ship of 112 tons which was renamed Independence. The Independence became the flagship of the First Texas Navy and was placed under the command of Captain Charles E. Hawkins; she fought a battle with Mexican naval forces on June 14, 1835, off Brazos Santiago. The second schooner was Brutus; she was nearly twice as large as the Independence and was placed under Captain William A. Hurd, the former commander of the privateer William Robbins, which was also acquired for duty in the regular navy. The William Robbins was renamed Liberty and was commanded by Captain William S. Brown, whose brother, Captain Jeremiah Brown, commanded the fourth schooner, named Invincible. The next engagement after the Correo de Mexico affair occurred on December 19, 1835, when the William Robbins liberated the American merchant ship Hannah Elizabeth, which had been captured by the Mexicans for carrying two cannons, allegedly intended for the rebels_


> _As a result of the taking of Correo de Mejico and the Hannah Elizabeth, the Mexican Navy responded by escorting their merchantmen. The schooners Bravo and Vera Cruzana were two of the vessels known to have been involved in escort duty. Meanwhile, the Independence was dispatched on a solo cruise of the Mexican Gulf for the first three months of 1836. She was successful in capturing multiple small fishing vessels and disrupted communications between Mexico and General Antonio López de Santa Anna's army in Texas. On March 3, Captain William S. Brown in the Liberty was sailing to the Yucatan when he encountered the armed Mexican merchantman Pelican. In the ensuing battle, the Texans captured the enemy ship while under fire from the fortress at Sisal. The Pelican was then sent as a prize to Matagorda but she ran aground on a sandbar off the port and was wrecked. Over 300 kegs of gunpowder and other military supplies were found on board the ship and it eventually was utilized by General Houston's army. Liberty captured the American brig Durango shortly thereafter and it too was found to be carrying Mexican Army supplies. Around the same time, Captain Jeremiah Brown in the Invincible took the American brig Pocket at the mouth of the Rio Grande; she was carrying contraband as well but her owners informed the United States Navy_",False,1650647989.0,t3_u95nyv,t1_i5rtxy1,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Can they quickly link up in deep Ukrainian rears, creating two encirclement rings (inner and outer)? With a guarantee that the enemy won't break them immediately and won't create their own 'sailients' for the advancing forces? (Germans did this on multiple occasions in 1942 with our forces).

 >An element of explosive reactive armour (ERA) is made out of a sheet or slab of high explosive sandwiched between two plates, typically metal, called the reactive or dynamic elements. On attack by a penetrating weapon, the explosive detonates, forcibly driving the metal plates apart to damage the penetrator. Against a shaped charge, the projected plates disrupt the metallic jet penetrator, effectively providing a greater path-length of material to be penetrated. Against a kinetic energy penetrator, the projected plates serve to deflect and break up the rod.

 >The Kh-55 (Russian: Х-55, also known as RKV-500; NATO reporting name: AS-15 ""Kent"") is a Soviet/Russian subsonic air-launched cruise missile, designed by MKB Raduga. It has a range of up to 2,500 km (1,350 nmi) and can carry nuclear warheads. Kh-55 is launched exclusively from bomber aircraft and has spawned a number of conventionally armed variants mainly for tactical use, such as the Kh-65SE and Kh-SD, but only the Kh-101 and Kh-555 appear to have made it into service. Contrary to popular belief, the Kh-55 was not the basis of the submarine- and ground-launched S-10 Granat or RK-55 Relief (SS-N-21 ""Sampson"" and SSC-X-4 ""Slingshot"") designed by NPO Novator.

Middle powers don't generally have the economies to supply large forces with lots of equipment so the general strategic policy is to maintain at least something in each capability so your force has the know how and experience in using it.

Yes, the most impact on Germany. Because the German industry needs gas now, while Russia can continue to wage war until they run out of equipment. Which they can't replace with or without EU money, due to sanctions.

I literally never said anything like that, you're imagining things now. We're discussing whether it's a big deal that Hungarians can't fully use their language at school, has nothing to do with the current war.

I'm not sure where I claimed to be oppressed.

You are not showing the faintest understanding of the situation, I'm sorry. You keep comparing the US and Canada to Europe and it's just ridiculous. I'm not even sure why you think Quebec is a good example, they almost became independent, in part because of the language difference.  

People moved from Europe to the US and Canada to leave their old lives and countries behind. Hungarians in Ukraine were removed from their own country a hundred years ago by outside forces. Again, if you don't see the difference, I can't help you.

I'm not sure how that's relevant. I'm the descendant of Charlemagne but that doesn't make me an expert in France's internal affairs.

I suggest you take a look at the map again, then. If a NATO AWACS loiters around Braila in Romania (which they regularly do), and they can only detect low flying planes out to 400 km, then they'll detect *anything* flying over the Black Sea starting from Sevastopol. The *entirety* of the Black Sea between Crimea, Ukraine and Romania is within those 400 km.

So if a transport plane tries to fly into Transnistria from the Black Sea, they'll be detected at least half an hour before they even reach the Ukrainian coastline.

However, you can look at whether Germany could physically compensate for the sudden stop of Russian gas. That is, whether there's enough transport infrastructure to get gas from the alternative sources (LNG from the US and Qatar) to where it's needed (industry within Germany). Are there enough tankers? Are there LNG terminals, or pipeline from places with LNG terminals (Rotterdam)? Are there enough trucks and trains for transport within Germany? 

According to the highest authority on this, the German ministry of Economics, the answer is no to all of these. Germany's industry would fail, with consequences much worse than the debt crisis, according to pretty much everyone. I don't fault you for not having paid attention to the debt crisis in detail, you're American. 

But even without that familiarity, just consider this: If one of the weakest links of the EU having debt issues during one of the strongest economic periods nearly leads to a splintering of the EU, what would the by far strongest link cratering their exports & EU contributions lead to?
