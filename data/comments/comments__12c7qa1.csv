I just saw an interesting video interview of a French fighter in Kramatorsk, coming back from a mission in Bakhmut. I will try to translate a few things here :

* They work in teams, and his team has five guys
* They came to fight for ideals, but once on the ground you fight for your life of course
* He came a year ago
* They are brought in and out of Bakhmut with armored personal carriers, because the access road is possibly in fire range of the enemy.
* They then walk up to their position

* He describes the Bakhmut fights in three phases :

  * in January there were many waves of twenty or so soldiers every two hours,
 * then Bakhmut was almost encircled in February and they were concerned about being cutoff, but the Ukrainian army reacted very well and pushed back with adequate means (personnel and material)
 * Now in the third phase there are still many fights but the lines are not moving as much, and there are no human waves anymore. Less opponents but more prepared than in January.

* a lot more Russians killed than Ukrainians, but he does not want to talk about numbers, situations are very different in Bakhmut with building covers and around Bakhmut with the trenches.

* a video is shown of a building destroyed by artillery, supposedly because it was full of wagnerites
* When using less precise artillery mortars, Ukrainians go closer than the maximum range to get a better precision. They are managing the shell supplies since the war started, so they try to be as precise as possible.

* It is very strange to fight in apartment buildings, you see firsthand that people lived there even if most evacuated. There are still things left behind, you fight in living rooms and really feel you are fighting for someone. He also says that those civilians didn't deserve to see their home city destroyed as it is now. Some civilians are still in Bakhmut, he even heard some say they saw children.

* He fights for 36h every time he goes to Bakhmut, then go back to rest in Kramatorsk for a few days. It feels really strange to go back to a ""normal"" city, and to meet people with whom you fought side by side in Bakhmut at the supermarket while shopping.

* using drones in Bakhmut now is pretty rare since there is EW, and the drone would give the operator position too easily. The enemy is sometimes very close, up to 200m.

* their group benefit a lot from donations from France, from individuals doing charity fundraisers. Unfortunately this does not include military grade equipment, they would like night vision goggles (from my understanding they currently have monocular, not binocular), and infrared lasers for aiming.

* Ukrainian food is not as good as the French food, pig fat slices are shown.

* He praises the Ukrainian creativity and grassroots organization in fighting this war

* he has a uniform patch with a Napoleon silhouette and the French and Ukrainian flags

It is really strange to see this war with such a personal and close view of the front line. The lessons from this war for historians, social sciences and armies are going to be phenomenal.",False,1680687421.0,t3_12c7qa1,t3_12c7qa1,,0,257,0,257,1,0,

0a19958ad6cba88340c3157d34e938f1,12c7qa1,jf0geyt,"Since I had a hell of a time finding it, here’s what’s in the latest $2.6bn security package from the US:

Presidential drawdown, for delivery from US stocks:

- Additional munitions for Patriot air defense systems;
- Additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS);
- 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds;
- 120mm mortar rounds;
- 120mm and 105mm tank ammunition; 
- 25mm ammunition;
- Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missiles;
- Approximately 400 grenade launchers and 200,000 rounds of ammunition;
- 11 tactical vehicles to recover equipment;
- 61 heavy fuel tankers;
- 10 trucks and 10 trailers to transport heavy equipment;
- Testing and diagnostic equipment to support vehicle maintenance and repair;
- Spare parts and other field equipment.

Under USAI [sourced new from the manufacturers], the DoD will provide Ukraine with:

- Additional munitions for National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS);
- Nine counter-Unmanned Aerial System 30mm gun trucks;
- 10 mobile c-UAS laser-guided rocket systems;
- Three air surveillance radars;
- 30mm and 23mm anti-aircraft ammunition;
- 130mm and 122mm artillery rounds;
- 122mm GRAD rockets;
- Rocket launchers and ammunition;
- 120mm and 81mm mortar systems;
- 120mm, 81mm, and 60mm mortar rounds;
- 120mm tank ammunition;
- Javelin anti-armor systems;
- Anti-armor rockets;
- Precision aerial munitions;
- Approximately 3,600 small arms and more than 23,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition;
- Seven tactical vehicles to recover equipment;
- Eight heavy fuel tankers and 105 fuel trailers;
- Armored bridging systems;
- Four logistics support vehicles;
- Trucks and ten trailers to transport heavy equipment;
- Secure communications equipment;
- SATCOM terminals and services;
- Funding for training, maintenance, and sustainment.

What I thought was most interesting was the focus on anti-air capabilities. I think those c-UAS systems are a new addition. They’re 70mm Hydra rockets that have a guidance unit added which gave them a 100% kill rate against UAVs in a test. They only cost $22k each, so quite a bit more affordable than more Patriot missiles. 

Some info on them: 
https://militaryembedded.com/unmanned/counter-uas/c-uas-laser-guidance-kits-demonstrated-in-dod-test

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Precision_Kill_Weapon_System


Also more bridging systems (probably M60s), which will be needed for any upcoming offensive action.

They wrote a convincing piece that she was a patsy, completely naive.  Some of the evidence is that she was supposed to fly out of the country the afternoon, a ticket had been purchased on her behalf.  In stead of heading to airport, she walked around for hours in a daze.  Also they point out she clearly didn’t know bc she sat nearby.  They also report that she was to message whoever was orchestrating this that she’d given package.  She didn’t realize had bomb.  She told those who interviewed her she’d been ‘set up,’ she realized, went and waited to be arrested, believed the bomb killed multiple people.  *Fontanka* portrays her as credibly naive, obeying commands over messages because she’d be rewarded with tickets out of Russia—its an image of a contrite person who realized they were duped—not a radical.  This is different from articles 36hrs ago that she is involved with Navalny or anti-Russia “terrorism.”  They point to the fact that her husband doesn’t live with her, and the marriage itself was an experiment—which they find perplexing...as if trying to say she’s gullible and/or a pushover. They point out she was likely the last in a chain of participants, none of which knew they were handling a bomb.  They point out that she’s openly given all information she has, and the parcel itself was given by a random taxi driver in Moscow—likely one of many who handled it unwittingly.

Reading thru the public’s comments—they seem to buy the narrative.  As an actual criminal would try to evade arrest, and wouldn’t put self next to bomb.  Many call her foolish.  Many pity her.  Some say she’s just the last in the chain, the first in the chain should be the target.  Others remain cynical, pointing out who benefits from such (siloviki wars) and she probably unwittingly accepted it from them.

🔹After that, it will be much easier to secure de jure membership. Ukraine is already using Western weapons, and we are getting closer to Alliance standards. Accordingly, this programme is designed to speed up our accession.

🔹The meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission is a testament to the victory of diplomacy, including Ukrainian diplomacy.

> Over and over again, there have been suggestions that the world simply can’t keep up with the pace of ammunition being expended in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine

Yep. There is a global artillery shell shortage right now and it’s basically an arms race between Russia and NATO to determine who can produce or procure enough ammo. Both sides are also trying to introduce more weapons systems into the war so that they can tap other ammo stockpiles.

Russia’s stockpiles may be big but they’re certainly not infinite and this war is stretching them to the max. Personally one of the reasons I’m more confident in Ukrainian longterm success is because the 30-35 countries that are providing tangible support for Ukraine just have much larger production potential even if it takes a year or more to really get those lines going.

47cebd9d28d1be1cdb0ad6df31b5842d,12c7qa1,jf39qcl,"That doesn't surprise me.  

Earlier this year a diplomat from a southern country, I forget which, said that they really don't like working with China and effectively selling their children's future to China, but they have no alternative. They desperately need the money and investments and China is the only country consistently helping them. Western investors pulled out and raised rates when things got rough on the global markets.  

It's pretty bad for some southern countries. Climate change is already seriously effecting them and their ability to grow crops, the price of grain is causing worries regarding food production and the price of artificial fertiliser is so expensive that the diplomat said one nation is already having to subsidise the costs or the farmers won't be able to afford it and that in turn will cause food shortages. I'm not sure if more nations are having to subsidise the costs or not.  

All of that and more has to come out of already incredibly tight budgets. So with only China realistically helping them it puts them in the difficult position of having to do what China wants or else. The diplomat said this is particularly relevant to how they are able to vote in the UN. They can't easily go denouncing Russia or voting against Russia if they want to keep China happy.  

The diplomat was basically begging for western nations to make them an offer and work with them again or they'll have no choice but continue working with China and selling their children's future to China.  

Coming from a farming background I've heard many farmers complaining here in the UK whenever artificial nitrogen based fertiliser gets expensive. The manufacturing process is dependent on fossil fuels, specifically gas. When global prices get too high many of the manufactures just stop production. That in turn means the remaining limited stocks of fertiliser rocket up in price even higher and more quickly than before.  

The fossil fuels going up in price also effects shipping of goods and resources to and from southern nations. Russia destroying farmland in Ukraine and preventing shipments of grain to southern nations scares the hell out of the southern nations.  

Russia is basically holding the southern nations who depend upon those grain shipments from Ukraine as hostages.",False,1680722483.0,t3_12c7qa1,t1_jf2y43p,,1,35,0,35,0,0,

It also allows them to test the waters for Taiwan - if the west gets tired of supporting Ukraine, big win for China as intervention elsewhere is going to be a hard sell. 

Russia I think is basically treading water. I imagine their only real hope for a fast resolution is to rapidly defeat any Ukrainian counter offensive this year and so provide a disincentive for further western aid. That seems unlikely to me, they seem operationally incapable of creating a strategic breakthrough and at best will be forced to play for time and try and grind Ukraine down. Even with inflated casualties though, it has been so expensive for Russia in equipment and manpower, let alone sanctions, that it seems like an unviable strategy. Even if they end up in Kiev this time next year, Russia is done for the foreseeable as a great power; their inability to make progress in Ukraine has definitely had an impact on their geopolitical standing and influence. Sanctions will likely bite a lot harder this year too, and there is a limit to how many prisons you can empty and conscripts you can grab before it really starts hurting - if there is a continued stalemate, at current casualty and equipment attrition rates I suspect Russia will struggle sooner than Ukraine. 

Ultimately, I think the conflict has accelerated a tilt eastwards and the new geopolitical world order; China is the only realistic challenger to the US. I'm not sure that the conflict helps them enormously though - the US gains by demonstrating to the world the value of its military support to embattled nations, and the west as a whole has been pretty unified and is largely consistent in being at best ambivalent about China anyway. It has helped demarcate power blocs to an extent, which is probably beneficial to China as the one with the most to gain by presenting itself as the alternative to the US, but there has been no clear realignment of the influential Arab states or South America, both of which have reasons to move away from US influence, which suggests that China's diplomatic reach is limited. They also are significantly behind the US in soft power globally, and that hasn't really changed. 

Tl;Dr, no particularly significant change for geopolitics, the US is on top, Russia drops, China is definitely pretender to the crown, west more unified behind US hegemony (probably up until the point the EU decides it needs a comparable fighting force of its own).",False,1680688118.0,t3_12c7qa1,t1_jf0f0gb,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

They've already likely taken every piece of workable military equipment from Belarus and initially Belarus did have some decent stockpiles for a country of its size. North Korea also has been so heavily sanctioned and is so desperate for cash that they're probably happy to sell off what little workable equipment they have to Russia as well but in terms of production capacity slave labor and decades old machinery with limited replacement parts can only take you so far. The best source of Russian resupply (that has already committed) is Iran as they have their own vibrant weapons industry and they don't care about sanctions. But again the issue for Iran is production capacity and while they can produce some weapons they just won't produce anywhere near enough to really turn the tide. Iran is also not going to risk their own regime security in order to help Russia and so while I'm sure they're happy to increase the shifts at the local weapons plant they're not going to hand over all of their stockpiles and leave themselves defenseless. They're also likely charging a significant premium for these weapons although right now Russia's pocket book is still bigger than their military stockpiles so the Kremlin is probably happy to pay.

Ultimately the elephant in the room is China but China still hasn't committed to sending heavy weapons to Russia and that's significant.

Russia’s hope in this war is that eventually the west will just get tired and stop sending aid and yet I think that’s pretty unlikely especially for the US.

That's the shell capacity. However Russia had an issue with not manufacturing enough of propellant for those shells.

...  This is exactly my original statement.  The point he made was applicable centuries ago ... not applicable to the majority of the 20th century and certainly not the 21st century.  Countries change.  Eras change.  Viewing modern day UK through the lens of the Age of Sail *is* folly. 

> Look, if you hear an expert speak and what he says makes 0 sense - then the possibility that he skipped explaining some intermediate logical steps in his argument is a lot more likely then him being full of hot gas.

He's not infallible.  Pretty much all of his analysis is simply his opinions and beliefs.  Sure he'll quote numbers and figures, but he's ultimately attempting to predict what's going to happen - he's been right about some stuff, he's been wrong about other stuff and in the future, he will be right about some stuff and wrong about other stuff.  

Here is an example - about 4 months ago, he predicted there would be no planting season in Ukraine with respect to Wheat.

[Zeihan Planting Season - at about 4:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkexC4P-4rw)

Ukraine has reported this month the following:

[Ukraine sees no need to limit wheat exports for the upcoming 2023/24 July-June season, as the winter harvest looks to be larger than expected, albeit smaller than in peacetime, a top agriculture ministry official said on Thursday.](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/ukraine-doesnt-plan-curb-202324-wheat-exports-govt-official-2023-03-02/)

The point is we shouldn't disregard what he says because he's been wrong in the past, but we can't just accept every one of his opinions and predictions simply because he's an expert.

I'm going to type out verbatim what he said on the UK from your video.  Read it and then read it again.  The entire focus of his statement is UK maintaining naval dominance.  What intermediate logical steps are we missing?

""The UK was always going to be anti-Russian because its a naval power on an island.

Repeating ruZ talking points now?

Which 'western invasion' was not authorised by the security council according to the principles of international law?

Look I am not nitpicking here. You have stumbled onto one of the fault lines between the east and west. The west conducts military actions after UNSC approval and is not into annexation.

The autocrats point to these lawful security actions, and says ""see? That's why we're allowed to exterminate Ukraine, it's because the west does it too"".

The UK in general has a principled and idealistic approach to international law. The UK is one of the counties behind the modern multilateralism - the treaty of Westphalia, the concert of europe, the league of nations, the UN - all were delivered in some part by the UK.

That is why UK supports Ukraine. It's not self serving. It's not blowing in the wind - it's the same approach to multilateralism and ""fair play"" which they have always taken. (Apart from the super perfidious parts of Albion's history, I mean).

You are approaching this the same way which the ruzzians do: UK must be self-serving, they are only faking their principles etc.

Yet I think if you stopped 100 Brits on the street and asked: why do you want your MPs and government to support Ukraine?

Then Trump threatened to end NATO, because he saw it as a bad business deal. After that he looked at the numbers of rising spendings of the European members and claimed, that was because of his stupid threats.

This isn't a mystery.  The major politicians advocating for Brexit, Boris and Cameron, did it as a political stunt believing it would never pass - they literally resigned the week after, despite pretending to be proponents of it.  What they sold the masses is that it would free up government expenditure (it didn't), reduce EU influence on economic policies (they have to agree to the same EU policies but now have zero ability to affect said legislation) and reduce illegal immigration - it's ended up hurting the UK economy far more than the EU.  If they were nervous about an economic hegemony represented by the EU, exiting said hegemony literally accomlishes this.

The UK has been allies with Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union - I don't possibly understand how giving more aid, militarily and economically, to Ukraine competes with Germany and France.  All 3 are close allies, all 3 are NATO countries.  If Zeihan's stated idea is its about naval dominance, it makes less than 0 sense - none of this contributes to naval superiority.

Ukraine's intention is to join the EU, there will never be a bilateral trade agreement between the UK and Ukraine outside of the control of the EU if they join.  It's an impossibility.

The Ukraine - UK - Poland pact you're referencing has no economic relevance.  It's goal is to improve cyber security and counter disinformation.  It was initiated by the Ukraine, which again, is not a member of NATO (if they were, they wouldn't have to), hency why they've attempted to create multiple small alliances.  Ukraine also initiated similar pacts with Lublin Triangle, Association Trio, and Quadriga.

But to be fair, to accurately predict global outcomes is notoriously difficult.  As the previous example, Ukraine is the 5th largest wheat exporter and absolutely there is a decline in production, but its a farcry from Ukraine's Agricultural department predicting a 20% drop in yield and then his ""there will be no planting season"" and there will be severe global food outages.  As an example.  I still consume his content, just with some skepticism.

Anyways, I do appreciate any convo like this, even if I do come across like an asshole.",False,1680742031.0,t3_12c7qa1,t1_jf4hu04,,8,2,0,2,0,0,

Think it has to do with what he thinks will get people to keep watching him. In the end he's a lot more entertaining to listen to than someone like Khofman, where the guy is barely ever makes predictions as to not make inaccurate ones.",False,1680743303.0,t3_12c7qa1,t1_jf4kvm4,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
