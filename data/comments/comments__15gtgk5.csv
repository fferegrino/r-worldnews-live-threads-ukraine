Not only pieces of artillery and crews at the front but the ammo depots and repair crews at the back.  

These attacks are going to continue through August and into September and so will the pushes of the UAF.  Russian command is going to be forced with worse and worse logistical decisions and eventually sectors of the front will not have the supplies they need at the exact moments they need them and will have to retreat.  

Here's an incomplete list from June and July for your scrolling pleasure.

fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,15gtgk5,juoluv7,"Day 521-526 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Our city has been attacked twice with both missiles and drones since my last post. There were also other attempts to hit us with drones that thankfully weren’t successful. Our region rarely gets attacked by Shaheds, but for some reason during this past week it has been happening almost every day, so it’s pretty notable. Well, at least Shaheds are much easier to intercept than the usual S-300 missiles that they attack us with, though sadly some drones still manage to make it through our air defense.

About 4 days ago they launched some S-300 missiles from Belgorod at Kharkiv and Kharkiv oblast. They hit some enterprise’s warehouse in the city and damaged multiple residential buildings in Kharkiv oblast. Still not sure what they are trying to achieve by targeting civilians, since everyone already understands that it doesn’t work as a scare tactic. They hit an apartment building Kryvyi Rih with an Iskander missile the other day, killing at least 6 civilians and injuring 80 more. A tragedy like that is now a common occurrence, it’s already barely being talked about despite the fact that it only happened less than a week ago, so then what the fuck was even the point of doing it?

The next day after the missile strike, Kharkiv was attacked by a group of Shaheds, some were intercepted, but 3 of them did manage to reach the city in the end. One of them hit a dormitory and the rest just fell on the ground somewhere in the center of the city. I think this was the first time for us that we were able to clearly hear the sound of the Shaheds flying nearby, they pretty much flew over my district, maybe a bit closer to the outskirts of the city. Gotta say, their sound does make you very uncomfortable, we moved to the hallway/bathroom immediately after hearing it and shortly afterwards we heard the explosions. I guess at least with drones we can actually hear the danger approaching because of the sound that they make, unlike missiles like S-300, which still manage to surprise you even when you know that they are coming. Usually, missiles launched from Belgorod hit us about 1-2 minutes after launch, so there’s barely any time to react.",False,1691101184.0,t3_15gtgk5,t3_15gtgk5,,0,191,0,191,1,0,

The publication notes that the Ukrainian military command has changed tactics, focusing on wearing down Russian troops with artillery and long-range missiles instead of storming minefields under fire.

Troops are building up in the south of the country, and a second wave of Western-trained forces is launching mostly small-scale attacks to break through Russian defense lines.

If they arrive things are going to get... rough for Russia. Assuming they arrive in sufficient numbers, given they are a weapon specifically manufactured from Ukraine right from US factories and are cheap, it is possible. Maybe not this year (though it would be amazing) but certainly in 2024.

What is so amazing about them? Their range allows them to hit all of the front minus Crimea and Kerch. They have an air maneuverability that allows them to change course 360° allowing them to hit a target from any desired angle, up, down, sides, behind, front. This is a capability the SS, HIMARs and ATACMs lack. They are cheap and can be spammed IF the US hand them in sufficient numbers. Which means also the effectiveness of Storm Shadows and HIMARs go up as they can be allocated to other targets and GLSDBs can take off the burnout.

1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,15gtgk5,juni8e3,"There has been stories on Alexei Dyumin and his future in Russia sources for 9 years.  Often, the published articles mention that he’s being groomed as a possible successor to Putin.  Over the last 6 months, his name has been repeatedly mentioned by sources as who say he is being mentioned as who should/will replace Shoigu, if such needs to be done.  

Such claims ramped up with the Prigozhin rebellion, when some sources said he played a role as an intermediary.  

Today, the often-sited Russian source, VChK-OGPU (which focuses primarily on corruption in the siloviki, military brass, and prosecutors’ offices) once again suggests his connection to a shoigu replacement, but that this time, it’s Dyumin himself suggesting, after having to intervene in some MOD power struggles.  (Note that Dyumin is very close to Putin.  They’re hockey buddies, even.) 

Here is the direct link, can put it thru a translation app:

https://t\.me/vchkogpu/40494

*It’s worth reading bc it also shows the dysfunction of the MOD, that politicians either must intervene, or even that they can intervene and have influence. I didn’t post the content directly bc it has several internal links.*
_____

Sidenote:
Every major independent Russian publication and most think tanks  have a profile on Dyumin—who first rose to widespread prominence with the post of leading the annexation of Crimea.  He was subsequently given the high profile post of Governor of the region just adjacent to Moscow.  He’s in everyone’s (Russian and Western) list of top 5 likely Putin successors.  The most recent profile on him was a few days ago by the prominent *Important Stories*. [Here is the translation of the article.](https://istories-media.translate.goog/stories/2023/07/25/kto-takoi-aleksei-dyumin/?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp&_x_tr_hist=true)

^(By the way, that article shared an interesting tidbit at the end—they discovered and disclosed that he has Ukrainian relatives that his wife *at least* maintains fb contact with—his female cousin is a Ukrainian citizen, works for the UA Ministry of Energy, openly condemns RF invasion, yet she and Dyumin’s wife at least superficially post positive comments on each other’s vacation photos.  How, if any, this would impact the war if he reaches an even higher position is unclear.  After all, he’s by no means the only powerful person with connections over the border.  For example, Ukraine’s N^o 2 Andriy Yermak’s mother is a native of Russia, his cousins are Russians, as are his grandparents who he used to stay with each summer growing up.  Apparently, that was part of the reason he was initially selected to be the rep at the Normandy Format.  And in Russia, many high profile Russians have UA relatives, including Kiriyenko, Matviyenko, Kozak and many others—it has zero impact—of course, they all came from areas where there exists some pro-Russia sentiment anyways. Note that those first two are fervent supporters of the war; Kozak, not so much and consequently receded from prominence after invasion.  Btw, Kiriyenko and Kozak were both at one time also reported as being groomed, but just haven’t kept their high probabilities by analysts; Matviyenko is, actually, in the line of succession if Putin were to die in office, but no one thinks she’d actually become President.)",False,1691086722.0,t3_15gtgk5,t3_15gtgk5,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

I believe current events in Russia make more sense if you think of Russia's government as a traditional European monarchy rather than as a modern dictatorship.

These revolts did not attempt to remove or kill the monarch (although there were other revolts with this aim).

Key takeaways:

* Kofman reiterated his previous position that the Ukrainian decision to fight for Bakhmut was a strategic failure: -> he claims that the overall casualty ratio for the battle was 3-to-1 or perhaps even as high as 4-to-1 in Ukraine's favor, but they traded the lives of their professional units largely in exchange for Wagner convicts. He further argues that if Ukraine had pulled back earlier, Wagner would've had no luck advancing further into the heights around Chashiv Yar and they would've been stuck holding the poor terrain of Bakhmut. On top of that, the highly skilled, well experienced Ukrainian units that were stuck defending Bakhmut weren't able to rest and refit in time for the Ukrainian offensive where they likely would've been highly effective (veteran Ukrainian units have made most of the advances as part of ongoing offensive). Beyond all of that, the decision to hold Bakhmut meant that Russia seized the initiative from Ukraine, and allowed the majority of the Russian army (who weren't involved in the fighting at Bakhmut) to deeply entrench in the South at the level of the Combined Arms Army.

* Kofman also heavily criticized the decision to equip brand new units with Western kit. These units were made up of mostly mobilized personnel with no prior military service, and led by a hodgepodge of commanders pulled from other units. They were given a rushed training regimen on Western-style combined arms, but without enough time to learn how to operate cohesive and without the airpower that this doctrine relies on. Worse than that, these units were then sent to attack the most heavily fortified Russian positions in the entire theater as their first operations as a unit, with no knowledge of the terrain. The whole scheme was flawed from the get go, and the performance of these units has been pretty abysmal as a result.

* He seemingly implies that Western decisionmakers had a key role in shaping this offensive in a way that was likely to prove ineffective. 3 months of training in Western style training was insufficient to teach these units how to conduct a Western style advance, especially without the enablers the West enjoys like air superiority. Instead Western policymakers should have met the Ukrainian military where they are, supporting them in how they already know how to fight by ramping up Western military industrial capacity in order to properly supply the Ukrainian method of fighting.

* Kofman thinks it would've made much more sense to pull some of their veteran units off the line and retrain them on Western kit, arguing that their experience would mesh well with the new capabilities of the Western gear. Beyond that, instead of forming brand new units, Ukraine should have just continued its practice of building up existing formations by adding new battalions as they would be integrated into command structures and logistical arrangements that were already experienced and effective.

* Kofman seemingly suggests that political decisionmakers are influencing military strategy such as the decision to hold Bakhmut despite unfavorable conditions.* Exact quote: ""What makes anyone assume that some of the core decisions being made are being driven by military strategy born of the general staff versus political leadership...""

* Suggests that the counteroffensive actually started in mid-May, but only in earnest in early June.

* The Ukrainian offensive involves three separate lines of advances, the main effort is pushing South from Orikhiv down to Melitopol, a supportimg axis pushing south from Velkya Novosilka down to Berdiansk, and a fixing action around Bakhmut. The Bakhmut effort involves some of Ukraine's most experienced units and has proven most successful, but is strategically irrelevant. Behind the existing Russian lines, they have defensive fortifications they can fall back to.

* Ukraine's offensive in the South and around Bakhmut left them weak around Svatove-Kreminna, which Russia exploited. A new Western Brigade there proved weak on the defense and was forced to retreat repeatedly, requiring the repositioning of other units to plug the gaps.

* A fair criticism of the offensive is that it was too broadly focused, which didn't allow Ukraine to obtain true artillery dominance on a single axis of advance, instead enjoying just modest advantages on several. This diffusion of effort is exactly the same problem that Kofman criticized Russia for in their Winter Offensive.

* Over the past 5 days there's been a renewed Ukrainian effort to push South of Orikhiv with much of the fighting around Robotyne.

* He believes the original plan was for IX Corps to break through the Russian front lines in the South and reached or possibly even breached the Russian main defensive line. X Corps was then supposed to follow up this advance and breakthrough the Russian main line, and then the reserves would've been introduced to develop momentum and push potentially all the way to the coast. This obviously didn't happen.
* Instead, the IX Corps struggled to make headway and the X Corps has been introduced in an attempt to reach the main Russian line of defense. The Ukrainian hope is that Russia will run out of reserves to plug holes in their defense, and while Kofman has seen some evidence of Russia utilizing some of its reserves already, the fighting of the last 4-5 days doesn't look much different from that of the past 7 weeks. They've only made modest gains, attaining limited ground around Robotyne. The newer brigades of X Corps haven't done well, similar to the other new Western brigades.

* He thinks the Russian forces have been on the wrong end of the attritional curve during the offensive, but have an easier task defending. Ukraine has been winning the artillery battle and counterbattery battle, especially as a result of the use of HIMARS at the tactical level. Storm Shadows used for deep strikes to target Russian command and control doesn't seem to have much of an impact on Russia's ability to defend. The Russian side is clearly being worn down, as a result of the fighting, but the fighting is now a slog.
* The main question of the offensive is will Ukraine be able to deplete Russian front line units enough to enable a breakthrough, without depleting their own forces too much in the process. He's unsure Ukraine will be able to make enough progress to achieve any of its strategic objectives with this offensive, and he's become more pessimistic having seen the results of the last two months.

* Personal note: Kofman sounds exasperated and frustrated during this podcast. He explicitly says he's more pessimistic about Ukrainian chances after seeing how things have played out over the past two months. Hard to blame him either, this offensive really hasn't lived up to the hype at all and may very well be Ukraine's last, best hope of achieving some of its key objectives in the war. We may have already seem the high water mark of Western support, and it was squandered in no small part due to Western influence on Ukrainian strategy, but also potentially by political decisions made by the Zelensky government.",False,1691082428.0,t3_15gtgk5,t3_15gtgk5,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

It takes about 9 months of flying under standard pipeline conditions of a new pilot coming from T-6/T-38. That is just to get qualified in the plane. You would receive more training once you got to your active unit. 

The F-16 is an easy aircraft to fly, but it can perform so many missions, that it is difficult to train someone to fully employ.  If you are using experienced fighter pilots, the time could be reduced if you are just showing them which buttons to push. Adding in that an experienced Ukrainian pilot may need to change tactics, it would need some more time. And you would want to have a unit trained up, not just a single pilot. 

The unsatisfying answer is that it is hard to tell. How much capacity do the NATO training units have?  How many pilots are ready to be pulled for foreign training?  How good is their English?  Since I know the Ukrainians have trained with NATO before, my hope would be quicker maybe 9 months.

Also if Bakhmut is strategically irrelevant why are the Ukrainians using some of their best units there? A holding action seems like a great place for green recruits to get some experience rather than the well defended south.

There are a few problems with his logic but this is probably the biggest one. If Ukraine hadn't defended Bakhmut he assumes that somehow enables Ukraine to stop Russia fortifying positions that *were well behind the front lines.* So Ukraine has to successfully attack deep into their lines to stop that somehow. It also assumes that Russia would have just left troops in Bakhmut after Ukraine pulled back and not used them elsewhere forcing Ukraine to fight there instead.

Him saying that Ukraine should have retrained veteran units on Western equipment also seems a deeply flawed suggestion as you lose the use of those units for that time *and* you still have to train new units on your legacy Soviet equipment anyway. So you've just doubled the amount of training you have to do while removing a lot of troops from the front lines for an extended period of time.... without knowing the exact numbers of Ukrainian troops you can't know if that would even be possible without weakening the front lines so much that it could give Russia a chance to breakthrough.

There are a couple other gaps like that in his reasoning but those are the two largest ones. I get he's frustrated but if you've summarized his arguments accurately it sounds like he hasn't thought his own criticisms through very well. Not saying Ukraine has made all the right decisions but his alternate suggested courses of action have their own issues and he can't assume things would have magically unfolded just as he predicted if they had followed them, I would wager they would not have.

That said, don’t you then dilute the effectiveness of your best units, who already have the task of assimilating replacements and rotating their veterans?

His thought process seems to contradict itself - defending Bakhmut with veteran units was a bad idea, but defending Kreminna with a new Western unit was also a bad idea? Who was supposed to defend Bakhmut? 

Beyond that, while Wagner convicts were present on the battlefield, the Wagner assault groups had been the *only* successful offensive force after the fall of Lysychansk. I’m not sure I agree that falling back to Chasiv Yar immediately and defending the area without the presence of your veteran formations would’ve worked. Terrain can only do so much for you, and Wagner managed to advance through the muck of late Winter and straight through the urban environment. Would the heights of Chasiv Yar defended by recruits really helped?

I disagree that Bakhmut was a strategic failure. The fall of the city was followed by the mutiny of the best fighting force Russia had to spare. Yeah, they bought some time for the Southern front to fortify, but opining on that trade off seems premature.

>Russia’s Central Bank said Thursday that the rube’s weakening was brought on by falling export proceeds.  
>  
>“We see that when our exchange rate weakens, various conspiracies arise about how \[the ruble\] is deliberated weakened to increase budget revenues… But we must look, first of all, at the dynamics of foreign trade,” Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.  
>  
>Nabiullina explained that the rube — which had initially plummeted beyond 100 against the dollar as war broke out in Ukraine — managed to restrengthen last year thanks to a surge in export proceeds and a fall in imports. **However, now the situation has reversed, as a sharp fall in exports means far less foreign currency is entering Russia.**

NATO needs to back up and supply this war as long as it reasonably can, though. It will reshape global geopolitical politics, and hopefully we can save as many Ukrainian lives as possible by doing so. Russia is coming out of this war much weaker than when they started.

Wagner’s professional units were probably the most effective troops left fighting for Russia, and they’re now off the battlefield. By exposing cracks in domestic support for Putin, the mutiny strengthened the position of politically loyal but militarily inept MoD officials like Shoigu and Gerasimov.

Westerns systems might not be as simple to maintain or repair for sure but have you ever seen the gunner use the fire control systems on an Abrams or Leo 2?

I've seen interviews where many people in the military talk about how the newer the equipment can often be *easier* to use than older because although they might be more complex more thought has been put into usability and a lot of the time now a process you had to do manually before is handled by computers which reduces work load on the crewman. For instance the firing control system on newer armored vehicles is actually much easier to use than older systems because you simply put your crosshair on the target and the computer works out where to position the gun to hit it.

Yes obviously experienced troops are going to put any piece of equipment to better use than a newly trained soldier but when I've heard so many interviews with military personal talk about newer equipment using some variation of the line ""man that makes it so much easier than what I had to do back in the day"" I don't think you can say that newer equipment is harder for troops to be trained on than older stuff is, I would say it's the opposite a lot of the time. Imagine a new gunner trying to hit a shot on the move in a T-72 with poor stabilization and fire control system while the brand new T-72 driver tries to use the a manual transmission and dual tiller steering system while trying not to stall it. Meanwhile someone in a Leo 2 just has to put the reticle on the target and their driver just has to concentrate on controlling his speed and using the yoke to steer because he's got an automatic transmission he doesn't have to worry about stalling.

This can even be applied to extremely high tech systems like the F-35 which essentially lands itself on aircraft carries now eliminating an extremely dangerous and daunting pilot task.

So yes while veteran troops might be able to use the vehicles more effectively in combat to say that they are harder to use than older systems is completely wrong in many cases, probably even most of them.",False,1691099220.0,t3_15gtgk5,t1_juoe1ru,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

You could certainly design a strategy of attrition, with the hope that mass casualties lead to a collapse of morale resulting in mutiny. And it certainly wouldn’t be “unpredictable” given the fact that the leader of the PMC was regularly recording videos demonstrating his contempt for the Russian MoD during the campaign. I personally think the Wagner mutiny was a direct result of the attrition they suffered in Bakhmut.

>defending Bakhmut at all was a strategic failure

But defending Chasiv Yar would not have been a strategic failure? I mentioned in my post why I don’t agree with that thought process. A campaign in Chasiv Yar could have easily played out the exact same way the Bakhmut defense did.

From bigger and bolder statements affirming support, security guarantees for Ukraine, the supply of longer ranged missiles, western tanks and jets, strikes in Crimea, Belgorod and now even Moscow. Suddenly everything that was once off the table is now in serious discussion. Every red line that the Kremlin attempts to draw sees NATO tippy-toing a foot across it regardless. Given how cautious they once were, maybe they know something that the general public isn't allowed to know just yet, if ever. We can speculate all day as to why the sudden and dramatic policy shift, but what us rational folks can rule out is that allies suddenly had a big ol' change of heart. 

2. Counter psy-op or not, what benefit does it serve to constantly discuss these risks? Choosing to not engage in lengthy discussions about it is a very different thing than naively assuming the Kremlin is bluffing. Let's assume they aren't bluffing, then what? Sure ww3 but does that suddenly invalidate all of our actions to this point? Does talking about it somehow prevent that inevitability? Or how about the alternative? We stop supporting Ukraine and allow the conflict to grind to a halt? Russia then gets to regroup and prep their logistics for another western provocation. Even worse still, we've now shown the Kremlin that NATO can be deterred by the threat of Nuclear war. So nextime we get bold and say ""No Mr. Putin, you can't have Latvia"", he throws out a tactical nuke to show he's willing to go there and we're back at square 1. By allowing ourselves to be deterred, then we actually INCREASE the likelihood of Nuclear use. So whats the better plan? This: ""Fuck your threats Mr. Putin.

Some mines have metal bodies, some have plastic, some have rubber. Glass or ceramic mines exist. Some are like soft plastic bladders filled with a soft plastic explosive; think latex party balloon filled with play doh. Historically, some have been made of wood. Some contain metal, some don't. Some have large air filled voids inside that can create distinct acoustic echoes, some don't. 

And many of them will be completely buried, either from being manually laid that way or from nearby explosions covering them with debris.

They're in a battlefield, which means thousands of metal fragments to confuse metal detectors.

Neither thermal nor lidar has much of a chance to spot buried mines, especially not after several years of grass growing over the top. Metal detectors will, as I said, give lots of false positives in any place that's been an active battlefield. 

Acoustic mine detectors (like radar but with sound waves) have been used, but as far as I know they've been phased out as being too unreliable and difficult to use. And they would be hard to use on a drone with  noisy propellers, plus you would have to fly so low as to touch the grass in order to use them.

Which leaves ground penetrating radar. Can you fit a large enough radar antenna and a powerful enough transmitter on a drone to actually see into the ground with the required resolution? And can ground penetrating radar reliably spot all those different kinds of mine or UXO? I think not.

And with traditional slow manual prodding, you can in fact be sure you gat all the mines down to how deep you stick your prods. It's just horribly slow and requires lots of skilled manpower to do. Like one man hour to clear one square meter slow.

MICLIC does a fine job of quickly clearing a narrow path for an advance, but it does a piss poor job of permanently clearing a larger area of all mines. The reason is, to either side of the fully cleared path it tends to scatter or further bury some mines without detonating them.",False,1691059703.0,t3_15gtgk5,t1_jullbvk,,6,6,0,6,1,0,

1) the elephant in the room is that if the West were in any way convinced that there was no significant and real threat of nuclear war, NATO would already have moved in with troops on the ground. Sure, we went from “perhaps red line #17” to “perhaps red line #16”, but that’s all it is - there’s been no real “change of heart” regarding the risk of catastrophic escalation, or we would have moved straight up to red line #1, namely actual NATO intervention. NATO is keenly aware of the continued significant risk of nuclear escalation, that is very clear.

2) this is a discussion forum, and in a rational discussion forum (especially given your supposed first point, i.e. “there is no longer any real risk, trust me guys”) there is no need to artificially constrain what can and cannot be discussed, and any important topic of discussion need not first prove its merits or otherwise be outlawed altogether - that is what propaganda and censorship does, and that’s what Ukrainian psy-ops and propaganda is trying to do on here with the thin arguments of “this is why no one can ever speak of the risks NATO and its population is facing, trust me, it’s much better if we forbid all mention of the-topic-the-cannot-be-discussed”.

Russia knows precisely what the result of an attack on a NATO country such as Latvia would be, and it is entirely absurd to simultaneously assume “there’s no real risk of Russia using nuclear weapons in a conflict over something as immediately important to them as Crimea”, but also “if we don’t engage them now under significant risk of immediate nuclear conflict, then surely later there’ll be a real danger of them using nuclear weapons over something significantly less immediately important as Latvia” - the two assumptions are always thrown out in tandem by Ukrainian propaganda, yet they are directly at odds with each other: either Russia is willing to risk nuclear war to protest their perceived core interests (in which case there is a significant risk RIGHT NOW), or they’re not even willing to risk nuclear war over their core interests (then there’s no risk of them credibly threatening nuclear war over something like Latvia, which has nowhere close to the immediate and historic military importance that Crimea holds, and which Putin has not tied his own fate to in the same way as he already has with Crimea) - both cannot be true at the same time, which is where this argument that is often repeated on here but not taken seriously by any actual geopolitical experts falls apart.",False,1691112000.0,t3_15gtgk5,t1_jup5zj2,,6,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Tl;dr: X-rays are shot into the ground. As they propagate in the soil, they bounce back from hidden objects. Different X-ray 'colors' carry information on different materials, so if we detect backscattered X-rays with 'color' information, we can identify different kind of mines.

As far as new tech is concerned, lightweight CMOS/CCD cameras are plenty good for X-ray detection. The main weight factor is the energy hungry source & the battery pack it needs to run.

From my complete layman's view it seems to be that artillery superiority is going to be the main factor in how this conflict ends. Neither side has air superiority or a means to quickly get it. Neither side has a vast difference in units highly trained and experienced in maneuver warfare or a means to quickly get them. What's moving the chains in this conflict is artillery and deep strike superiority and if there's one thing the west has been a tremendous help in its been in getting Ukraine to be able to achieve parity or superiority in their artillery game.

The Western tanks and IFVs and eventually the jets get all the headlines but at the end of the day in a battle between peers with no clear systemic advantages over the other weight of fire is what forces movement.

We went from top strategists predicting the fall of Kyiv and preparing Ukrainian resistance for an active insurgency campaign, to outright publicly stating our intent to see a strategic defeat of the Russian armed forces stationed in Ukraine. The point is that we are moving forward despite risk, that implies that either A) There is intel the public isn't privy to. B) NATO has privately calculated this possibility and have accepted the risk of escalation since appeasement is out of the question. They are actively preparing for  a potential decapitation strike or showdown with Russia. Perhaps the tip-toeing from red-lines 17 through 1 is a political play since public support is a component to any major war on foreign soil with an adversary. We jump straight to NATO intervention and the whiplash could see dramatic shift in public opinion. 


2. I'll start by saying that all I'm reading from you is excuses and deflection feeding to the delusion that we somehow have an ""out"". There is no acknowledgement of the present reality that our ""management of risk"" is entirely at the whim of an aging dictator. You're arguing that we should play into Russias psy-op and keep nukes as a hot topic when all that does is help stir the pot and deter public discourse from supporting actions in Ukraine. Yes, the threat is real, and assuming that the threat will somehow magically drop because we appeased Putin's ego is dumb. Ukraine's Psy-op holds no relevance to the discussion because it's reflective of our present reality. There is no alternative.

Part of your argument is sound because in such an absurd scenario, the inverse can also be true. If they are willing to Nuke over Latvia, we should expect nukes over Crimea and possibly Donbas. I argue against it because the alternative is appeasement. Regardless of the importance of Crimea versus Latvia, the act of appeasement to Putin's legacy sets a bad precedent. The game theory of more ""existential wars"" post-Ukraine isn't all that ""absurd"" because Putin has already stated in multiple instances both privately and publicly that he intends to re-draw Europe's borders by military means, he will not stop at Ukraine. Lastly, why is Ukraine's ""propaganda"" even a topic when the policy makers who have any actual control of the situation fully understand the risk of Nuclear escalation? When you boil it down, Russia's Psy-Op is aimed at extracting concessions, ""appeasement"".

It seems to be a nice idea, but not really practical or good enough. 

There's later scientific papers saying people have tried,  but couldn't get good enough depth of penetration without increasing the transmission power so much that the images get blurry due to x-rays bouncing more than once and still making it back to the camera. So that technique only works down to about two inches or 50mm, which isn't enough against typical anti tank mines or randomly deep-buried anti personnel mines due to nearby explosions. 


I guess it could still be helpful in conjunction with other methods, if only to reduce the wear and tear on mine rollers or flails by reducing the number of explosions they have to withstand.

There's also recent talk of using a powerful electron beam instead, penetrating deeper into the soil and causing X-rays to be created within the soil due to the bremsstrahlung effect. That could potentially go deep enough, but has its own problems if you want to mount it all on a drone.
