Day 15 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today it sounded like there was some intense fighting going somewhere nearby. Well, it might not have been too close as a lot of the time same explosion can be heard throughout most of the city. It also sounded like shelling is back but I’m not sure about that.

While everything is mostly alright in my part of the city just 2 days ago shelling destroyed a big shopping mall right in the center of the city, couple of our universities were also bombed, even ones that have no relations to military.

It’s been just 2 weeks and the scale of destruction is already enormous, they are destroying everything indiscriminately and they are still calling themselves “liberators”, they really should go liberate their own country, they desperately need it.

In the 1990s the US government created the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, named for the senators who sponsored the bill. This program was intended to deal with the leftover WMDs from the Soviet Union before they fell into the wrong hands.

The US spent a lot of money in Russia itself, well into the 2010s, hiring local Russian firms to for these projects. Dismantling old SS-24 missiles and chemical weapons and bad stuff like that. One particular program I worked on dealt with an old Alfa-class nuclear sub, just sitting at a dock with the fuel rods still in her reactor. A concern for obvious reasons. We paid a team of Russian firms to cut into her hull, remove the rods, store them in a specially-built steel cask, and ship it by train to a spent nuclear fuel storage facility.

It wasn't an expensive project, by federal government standards (low 7 figures in 2011 dollars). But we did it because it was the right thing to do for global security. If a bad actor had gotten ahold of this stuff, the consequences could have been catastrophic. But the Russians weren't dealing with it (either they couldn't afford to or just didn't give a shit). So the US did (and I believe partner countries like France contributed).

Now onto the labs. These labs, and many like them across the former USSR and Africa, are built for disease surveillance and that’s it. Reading samples of pathogens spreading in the human and animal populations. I reviewed the equipment list for these labs to build cost estimates and every single one was the same: PCR machines, autoclaves (big steam ovens for sterilizing things), biosafety cabinets, PPE for workers, etc. Every single thing that went into these labs could be bought off the shelf, and you can't buy ingredients for bioweapons off the shelf.

This ""bioweapons factory"" conspiracy is not new. Russia has been spreading it for at least a decade, specifically about a similar lab in Tbilisi, Georgia (called the Lugar Center). We invited a multi-national delegation, which included Russians, to tour the lab, and they concluded that it could not be used to make bioweapons. But of course, they don't give a shit.

Russian forces also appear to be largely stalemated around Kharkiv and distracted from efforts to seize that city. Russian advances in the south around Mykolayiv and toward Zaporizhya and in the east around Donetsk and Luhansk made little progress as well in the last 24 hours. Russia likely retains much greater combat power in the south and east and will probably renew more effective offensive operations in the coming days, but the effective reach and speed of such operations is questionable given the general performance of the Russian military to date. There are as yet no indications that the Russian military is reorganizing, reforming, learning lessons, or taking other measures that would lead to a sudden change in the pace or success of its operations, although the numerical disparities between Russia and Ukraine leave open the possibility that Moscow will be able to restore rapid mobility or effective urban warfare to the battlefield.

U.S., Allies Look at Sending Soviet-Designed Air-Defense Systems to Ukraine

WASHINGTON—The Pentagon is exploring ways to shore up Ukraine’s air defenses by facilitating the transfer of Soviet-designed antiaircraft equipment, according to U.S. and European officials.The U.S. is trying to determine which type of air-defense systems would work best, with Soviet-designed systems—ideally mobile ones—being the best option because they would require less training for the Ukrainians, a Pentagon official said.

They include what NATO refers to as the SA-8 and SA-10, which can target planes at much higher altitudes, as well as what Russia calls the S-300, which was a state-of-the-art system until a few years ago.The S-300 is an air-defense system, first produced by the Soviet Union and later Russia, that is capable of shooting down aircraft and cruise missiles. The S-300 was designed to be highly mobile, allowing air-defense forces to fire their weapons and quickly relocate to avoid being hit in a retaliatory strike.

A European diplomat said that Soviet-made systems like the S-300 would be easiest for the Ukrainians to integrate into their arsenal and employ quickly and effectively. The European diplomat suggested that the countries closest to Ukraine geographically that possess such systems could provide theirs to Kyiv on the understanding that other allies would replenish the countries’ stores with comparable systems.

“The Russians are changing their tactics, so the Ukrainians need to, too,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace told the House of Commons on Wednesday, calling Moscow’s airstrikes “indiscriminate and murderous.”

These shoulder-fired weapons, which are effective against helicopters and low-flying aircraft, are far less capable than the S-300.",False,1646974062.0,t3_tbbi82,t3_tbbi82,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

**Putin’s new Ukraine essay reveals imperial ambitions** | July 15, 2021

Russian President Vladimir Putin has outlined the historical basis for his claims against Ukraine in a controversial new essay that has been likened in some quarters to a declaration of war. The 5,000-word article, entitled *On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians*, was published on July 12 and features many of talking points favored by Putin throughout the past seven years of undeclared war between Russia and Ukraine.

The Russian leader uses the essay to reiterate his frequently voiced conviction that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people,” while blaming the current collapse in bilateral ties on foreign plots and anti-Russian conspiracies.

In one particularly ominous passage, he openly questions the legitimacy of Ukraine’s borders and argues that much of modern-day Ukraine occupies historically Russian lands, before stating matter of factly, “Russia was robbed.” Elsewhere, he hints at a fresh annexation of Ukrainian territory, claiming, “I am becoming more and more convinced of this: Kyiv simply does not need Donbas.”

Putin ends his lengthy treatise by appearing to suggest that Ukrainian statehood itself ultimately depends on Moscow’s consent, declaring, “I am confident that true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia.”

Unsurprisingly, Putin’s article has sparked a lively discussion in Ukraine and beyond. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initially responded by trolling his Russian counterpart and stating that Putin obviously has a lot of free time on his hands.

Others identified numerous imperial echoes and thinly veiled threats in Putin’s attempt to play amateur historian. Stockholm Free World Forum senior fellow Anders Åslund branded the article “a masterclass in disinformation” and “one step short of a declaration of war.” Meanwhile, Russian newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets claimed the essay was Putin’s “final ultimatum to Ukraine.”

Nobody in Ukraine needs reminding of the grim context behind Putin’s treatise. Since spring 2014, Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in an armed conflict that has cost over 14,000 Ukrainian lives and left millions displaced. The Kremlin continues to occupy Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and much of the industrial Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Earlier this year, Moscow massed over 100,000 troops close to the border with Ukraine in what some military observers described as a dress rehearsal for a full-scale Russian offensive.",False,1646975738.0,t3_tbbi82,t3_tbbi82,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

\[snip\]

A final issue is that Putin needs a successful campaign in the east (and the south) so he can claim some war successes if his military thrusts against Kyiv continue to stall. **If Russian forces retain control of ground already taken in the south & capture territory east of the Dnieper, Putin might claim a strategic success - for a Russian audience. It would also provide him with a bargaining chip in any ceasefire or war termination negotiations.**

However, this is all hypothetical. And, as the Russians have fully committed all their forces assembled for the invasion, it is difficult to see how they will sustain momentum – and logistically support – concurrent advances in the north, east and south. **Without a significant influx of troops from other Russian garrisons, the Russian high command may need to make a decision soon about which theatre is their priority for reinforcements to secure a breakthrough in the war.**

**That said, the eastern theatre is also a danger zone for the Ukrainian high command right now. In the coming days, Ukraine may need to trade ground for time, withdraw their troops and preserve Ukrainian units for other more important battles ahead. The eastern theatre bears close watching. If Russian forces make a breakthrough at Zaporizhya City or are able to generate momentum to the west of Kharkiv, we could see a significant change in the overall status of the war.**",1646971140.0,1646971012.0,t3_tbbi82,t3_tbbi82,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

Nothing Putin says publicly, even about nuclear war, should be taken seriously. Below is why.

Russia is fighting two wars. A war with the west and a war with its own people. The war with its own people is to maintain power through police action and disinformation. Keeping favor with the right and quelling unrest before it becomes an actual issue. This war is fought on the streets of its cities, by limiting access to information on the internet, and through Russian state media propoganda. The war with the west is being fought through espionage, cyber attacks, and threats of nuclear escalation. These are two completely different wars and require different rhetoric for each. The problem is that Putin can’t say ANYTHING publicly that won’t get back to the Russian people. So every public address is 100% propaganda, however much of that is true or directed at NATO cannot be assumed.

That’s why everything he says publicly should be assumed as first directed at its own people. Foreign affairs theatre, a strong show. So, Putin’s outlandish lies are not meant for the west, it is meant to quell insurrection, only. The RT propaganda is not meant to influence anyone outside of Russia media control. Putin knows that we know he’s full of shit. So, anything you see from Russian state media, even threats of nuclear war, should not be taken seriously. What should be taken seriously are his actions and the threats he has since balked on previously; like, “if anyone interferes it’s nuclear war.” And, “sanctions are a declaration of war.” This motherfucker has been bluffing the entire time. He hasn’t followed up on any of that shit? And why is that? Because he doesn’t want to die and he believes I’m his idea of A grand Russia, 2 things that cannot exist if he starts nuclear war.


How do we know this? Well, this guy isolated himself during COVID and has a 20ft long table for social distancing. No one that welcomes nuclear escalation is going to be so obsessive about his own health. No one that’s so set on rebuilding the USSR is willing to destroy a majority of it for not getting his way.",False,1646964732.0,t3_tbbi82,t3_tbbi82,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

Most of the arguments I see from those in favor of direct intervention also do not consider nuclear weapons to be a realistic option, either because they doubt Putin would use them (has them), or that direct confrontation would lead to it.  However, there is **no** evidence to suggest otherwise, only speculation on if xyz happens, then abc + z / x = Putin gone.  No nukes will ever get fired.  


Here is the reality of what we **KNOW**


First, understand the concept of MAD:


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction


Here are the current stated rules of nuclear engagement by NATO, the US, and Russia (those **red lines** everyone keeps asking about):


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_for_Joint_Nuclear_Operations


https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm


https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2021/04/29/russian_nuclear_doctrine_force_expansion_and_nuclear_deterrence_774957.html


Ok, so how many nukes (reportedly) are there?


https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/


Russia apparently has about 1500 deployed.  Even if 500 were still functional, they + the resulting exchange could end most life on earth.


>""but, but..  we would kick Russia's ass so fast that they wouldn't get a chance to launch them!""


Let me introduce you to the **REAL** horsemen of the apocalypse: 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio-class_submarine


https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/russia-submarine-capabilities/


10-20 minutes from launch to **BOOM**


Oh, and also…


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand


Is it still functional? I don't want to find out.


>Yeah, but we have antimissile systems that would knock out all their nukes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_missile_defense

It's not 100% effective.

If you are still cool with taking the risk, you need to understand the **MOST** important part of all of this.  **Even a limited nuclear exchange** is enough to cause world wide famine and death.  A full scale exchange would probably end the human race.  **Including killing all the people in Ukraine.**


If you doubt that, I highly suggest you read the following.  Be informed before you advocate for a rash move.

> No Western leader has announced conditions under which sanctions might end, an essential step if the sanctions serve a coercive strategy. It seems more likely the sanctions seek both to punish Russia for punishment’s sake and to weaken its economy to make the war more difficult — the traditional goals of economic warfare. If so, the sanctions are unlikely to end soon.

> […]

> Because economic pressure takes time to work, targets can anticipate their worsening situation before it reaches a crisis point. Once a future crisis seems inevitable, leaders face a closing window in which to try to avert the disaster they see coming. In such situations, they may decide they have little to lose if escalation provides even a small chance of improving their situation. Such calculations have not just affected the Japanese. Allied economic warfare drove Germany to adopt risky, war-expanding strategies in both World War I and World War II.

>Such gambles are even more likely if a state’s leaders are unusually willing to accept risk. Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, especially in light of the Russian military’s failure to perform as expected, and his increasingly shrill rhetoric suggest Putin may be at least as risk-accepting as were Japanese leaders 80 years ago. If so, the likelihood he would choose to double down is higher.

Russian state television has broadcast calls for Vladimir Putin, the country’s president, to stop his war in Ukraine during a programme in which pundits openly likened the invasion to ""Afghanistan, but even worse"".

Vladimir Soloviyev, usually one of the Kremlin's most reliable chief propagandists, had to interrupt guests on his prime time television talk show to stop their criticism of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Speaking during a broadcast on Russia 1, Karen Shakhnazarov, a filmmaker and state pundit, said the conflict in Ukraine risked isolating Russia.

He told Mr Soloviyev: “I have a hard time imagining taking cities such as Kyiv. I can’t imagine how that would look.”

He went on to call for the conflict to be brought to an end, saying: “If this picture starts to transform into an absolute humanitarian disaster, even our close allies like China and India will be forced to distance themselves from us. 

“This public opinion, with which they’re saturating the entire world, can play out badly for us ... Ending this operation will stabilise things within the country.”

Later during the broadcast of An Evening with Vladimir Soloviyev, one of Russian television's most-watched programmes, guest Semyon Bagdasarov, an academic, said: ""Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse?”

He said that in Ukraine “there are more people and they’re more advanced in their weapon handling”, adding: “We don’t need that. Enough already.""

The reference to Afghanistan, a conflict that scarred the Soviet Union and still scars Russia, was particularly poignant. The Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989, 10 years after it invaded, humiliated. 

Historians have said that the Afghanistan failure and the disillusionment that millions felt after it helped pull down the Soviet Union two years later. Thousands of Soviet soldiers were killed in the war, which became deeply unpopular at home.

A clearly irritated Mr Soloviyev, who owns a villa in Italy that has been seized and sanctioned by the European Union, interrupted Mr Bagdasarov. 

The Kremlin relies heavily on state television to project the message that Putin's so-called ""special operation"" to rescue the Russian kinfolk of Ukraine from Nazis is going to plan.

Kremlin state television is one of the few sources of information about the war for the Russian public, after authorities restricted access to some social media sites and forced independent stations off the air.

Russia has threatened to imprison anyone who criticises the war for up to 15 years.

Ukraine has fought a savvy media campaign, which has included filming captured conscripts repenting for the invasion.

News of the setbacks in Ukraine appears to be filtering back to Russia. Over the weekend, a video emerged which showed mothers of soldiers angrily confronting a regional official and accusing the Kremlin of using their sons as ""cannon fodder"". 

Small protests have also continued in Russia, despite a hard clampdown by the police.

The prime time Vladimir Soloviyev show is not the only one that appears to be straying off-message.

On the Russian ministry of defence's television channel, Zvezda, a serving army officer explained to a talk show audience how Russian soldiers were dying in Ukraine.

""Our guys over there, from Donetsk and Luhansk, and our special operation forces are dying and our country,"" he said.

""No, no, no,"" interrupted the presenter who gets up from his desk gesticulating and marches across the studio shouting: ""Stop!""

""Our youth are still dying,"" the soldier continued.

The best way is to wait it out and let sanctions hit and weaken Russia more, fighting back now, while the bear is only wounded but hasn't bled out yet, would be foolish. Maybe even Japan seizes their islands once there is civil war/unrest in Russia, if it comes to that.. 

But for now you can only hope that he isn't willing to sacrifice much for his slavic&germanic focused ideology. Its weird seeing him allying with China, when it's actually the enemy in his world view, according to the literature he just aims to replace USA as Europes best partner. Maybe it will even come to that, if a new Russia emerges some day.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

*Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad Oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term ""Moscow–Berlin axis"".*

*France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a ""firm anti-Atlanticist tradition"".*

*Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.*

*China, which represents a danger to Russia, ""must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled"". Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking Tibet–Xinjiang–Inner Mongolia–Manchuria as a security belt. Russia should offer China help ""in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia"" as geopolitical compensation.*

*Russia should manipulate Japanese politics by offering the Kuril Islands to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.*

*Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and ""United Ossetia"" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.*

*Russia needs to create ""geopolitical shocks"" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.*

 >Babi Yar or Babyn Yar (Ukrainian: Бабин Яр) is a ravine in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and a site of massacres carried out by Nazi Germany's forces during its campaign against the Soviet Union in World War II. The first and best documented of the massacres took place on 29–30 September 1941, killing some 33,771 Jews. The decision to murder all the Jews in Kyiv was made by the military governor Generalmajor Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch.
 
**[Kurenivka mudslide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurenivka_mudslide)** 
 
 >The 1961 Kurenivka mudslide occurred on 13 March 1961 in Kyiv, then a city in the Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. The mudslide started at the edge of the Babi Yar mass murder site and dumped mud, water, and human remains into the streets of Kyiv. The Soviet authorities suppressed information about the disaster, and claimed 145 people were killed, while forbidding any memorial events for the victims. A 2012 study in Ukraine estimated that the number of victims was closer to 1,500.

2. Yes. Neither is bnp paribas. They didn't announce any change for the future in terms if russian businesses. Deutsche Bank plans to cut the business with russia in the future. 

3. No one cares about schröder. In germany all of his office employees quit. Every honorable membership is being removed. Even his own political party is in the process of removing him. He has literally no influence in germany.

Additional: you can't forget. The EU - not only germany - is very dependent from russia in terms of resources. If russia would stop delivering the economy in the EU is funked as well. Not only could the citizens literally freeze to death in the upcoming winter also most of the industry comes to a stop.

Before you know scream that it was the fault of the eu to being too dependent. Well, Trump showed the world that the US is not the best partner to have either.

Also: atomic energy needs uran. Can you guess on which country all the EU members with atomic energy are depending on to get it? Almost 40% comes from russia or a connected state to them. We could get it from elsewhere - except that russia is literally the only country that produces WWER  compatible uran.

That's also why on the first March a russian plane was allowed in the EU - to deliver it.


So, yes, germany (among other countries) are not that harsh to russia compare to the US. But the US doesn't really need russia. So it's kinda weird to demand the same Aktions.

Spectral/spatial resolution is related in that the more spectral bands you have the lower the spatial resolution so detecting small amounts of gas from space is not really viable, particularly because I think most spectral Identification of gasses require long wave IR which are less energetic photons and more prone to atmospheric attenuation. 


Maxar sensors are between 30-50cm resolution depending on conditions.

Better examples imo are: Prussian-Austrian wars, the Dutch invasion of Belgium shortly after independence, French-Burgundian wars - those are all cases of 'brotherly' wars like the UA-RU war.

Tons of Russian commercial aircraft flying out of Moscow keep on squawking 7700 (general emergency) and diverting to other airports. It's usually south of Moscow, but still far away from Ukraine. 

On a normal day there are probably about ten 7700 emergency squawks worldwide, it's normal stuff like a passenger being unruly and needing to be met by police, or the odd minor mechanical problem, usually not a big deal. 

But (outside of Brazil) a bunch of emergency squawks in the same general location is highly unusual, especially suspicious near a war zone.  Two planes flying out of Kalliningrad turned around and landed again, at least four planes south of Moscow.  I could make a lot of inferences, but we simply don't know why. 

Even more interesting was one squawked the code for a hijacking temporarily before switching it to a normal emergency code. This could be an honest mistake (the numbers are similar, it happens).",False,1646977172.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i07gf1n,,1,16,0,16,0,0,

Intervening would give them an excuse to rile up the Russian citizens in support of the war, and give China an excuse to take a more aggressive stance and justify it to its citizens. As things stands, the West and the Biden administration did a great job at taking away any semblance of justification from Russia. This has weakened Russia's position internally, and made it difficult for other countries to support Russia more openly without losing face. If Russia is going to use a tactical nuclear weapon, let them do it in a situation where they cannot possibly justify it.  


I actually suspect that China would not be able to stand with Russia if they use a tactical nuke first, but that it might if NATO intervenes and then Russia uses a tactical nuke.

 However given their struggles I feel there's just mass incompetence at the middle levels of this operation. Simply got backed up because they didn't properly prepare their troops for a real resistance, perhaps. 

It's unfortunate the Ukrainians couldn't make hay while the sun shined, so to speak, and lay waste to the entire thing on the road. This is likely where a NATO trained force would have made short work. Good restraint from the ""west"" to not bite, even if it did look inviting. I'm not for war but I am for standing up for what's humanly right. We're getting close to some lines where I think we have a moral obligation. Not just due to the absolute disregard for human life but for the danger this poses to the rest of the world from this point on.

Whether it's a missed opportunity, time will tell. It's definitely going to be analyzed if this goes poorly and if Putin isn't stopped.

Putin is the sole authority, surrounded by people he has spent a couple decades pruning for obedience. Nobody stood up to prevent the Ukraine invasion, nobody is standing up to bring it to an end. It's not a superpower, it's a single unstable man who can make the world end with an order. In a situation like that, you try to find ways to calm him down rather than setting him off. You try to buy time for other people to work up the courage to remove him. You don't force the confrontation.

All the aid to Ukraine already risks setting Putin off. It's a calculated risk to try to defuse his attack without giving him excuses to raise the threat level. The worst good outcome is Putin conquers Ukraine and retreats to nurse his wounds for the rest of his life. The best good outcome is Putin fails to conquer Ukraine and either sues for peace or is deposed by other Russians who preferred life before the invasion. Those are both better outcomes than nuclear war. One of them is very good for Ukraine in the long run. The other leaves Putin with an endless insurrection and keeps him from ever threatening the rest of Europe with his army again.

If things get worse and a nuclear confrontation arises anyway, joining the fight in Ukraine would still have pushed up the tension higher and sooner. In a nuclear confrontation, you want as much room to back down as possible. And if the world ends either way, joining the fight in Ukraine would not have saved anyone in the long run. People with access to the best available intelligence made their best guess as to how far they can go to help Ukraine without pushing Putin to the brink.

SEAD. Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses. You use anti-radiation missiles to destroy radar sites and missiles. Current US inventory is the AGM-88. That has a range of approximately 60 miles. Aircraft wouldn't even get close enough to launch without being targeted and shot down.

You can't establish a NFZ without doing such. And that is not a matter of opinion. It's the rulebook for the US and NATO.

All that doesn't even matter though, because a NATO strike on Russian Soil, killing Russian Military members is the way you start a war with Russia.

The first five of these ultimate demands of Russia should be enshrined in the Constitution of Ukraine.

This was reported by Depo.ua with reference to the publication ZN.UA, which claims to have received them ""from reliable diplomatic sources.""

1. Refusal to join NATO. Neutral status of Ukraine. Russia, which attacked our country, is ready to become one of its guarantors.

2. Russian is the second state language. Repeal of all laws restricting it.

3. Recognition of Crimea by Ukraine as Russian.

4. Recognition by Ukraine of the independence of the ""DPR"" and ""LPR"" within the administrative boundaries of the regions (including the territories currently controlled by Ukraine).

5. ""Denazification"". That is, the ban on the activities of ultra-nationalist, Nazi and neo-Nazi parties and public organizations, the abolition of existing laws on the glorification of Nazis and neo-Nazis.

6. ""Demilitarization of Ukraine"". Complete abandonment of offensive weapons. Under it, if desired, you can bring any type of weapon.

We will remind, in the morning on February 24 the president of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin declared the beginning of military operation against Ukraine. After that, the shelling of Ukrainian cities began.

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the imposition of martial law in Ukraine. Soon the people's deputies approved the decision to impose martial law throughout our country.

Later, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had severed diplomatic relations with Russia and said that Ukraine was ready to provide weapons to anyone who wanted to protect the country from Russian invasion.

As of the morning of March 10, the Ukrainian military had liquidated more than 12,000 Russian occupiers and destroyed more than 2,000 units of Russian military equipment.

On March 10, Ukrainian and Russian Foreign Ministers Dmytro Kuleba and Serhiy Lavrov held talks in Antalya, Turkey. After the talks, Kuleba said that Russia's demands were unacceptable to Ukraine because they meant capitulation.",False,1646963599.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i06qpbx,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Still, this would likely trigger Russia to attack them in turn, and would not trigger Article 5 (as the NATO members would be the aggressors), so I find that scenario unlikely.",False,1646973234.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i0792wl,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

 >Conscription is the mandatory enlistment of people in a national service, most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and it continues in some countries to the present day under various names. The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the French Revolution in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful military. Most European nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1–8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.

The upper layer will freeze, but that's just a lie, you can crack it open and slip into a mire of freezing cold mud that will kill you in a heartbeat. A tank can easily find itself buried up to its armor in soup it didn't even see, because it's under three inches of frozen ice.

I once slept on what we thought was frozen earth. The heat radiating from me in my sealed sleeping bag (gore-tex outer shell sheds and keeps out water) melted the muck, and I woke up sunk a good inch or two into refrozen 'mud' that had effectively entombed my gore-tex zipper. I had to have a buddy literally hack me out of the ice to get free.

I have been in APCs in -20c weather. It is a fucking NIGHTMARE of cold. The steel you're sitting on leeches heat from your body and it feels colder INSIDE the unheated tank than it does outside in the fucking freezing weather. We'd huddle near the exhaust of Abrams (Was dismounted infantry in a Mechanized infantry battalion that often operated with tank battalions in the field side by side) to stay warm. Sometimes they'd purposefully stop just to heat us up.

We'd have more cold-related casualties during field maneuvers than anything else. Hypothermia, frostbite.

You weren't considered a 'real' soldier when you got to station in Germany until you'd survived a winter in the field. Unless you've had to live outside in weather like that it doesn't really translate. You cannot really understand just how fucking cold, and how fucking DANGEROUS it really is.

Every bit as inhospitable and lethal as deep desert, just different.

And the Russians don't have enough fuel to heat their tanks and trucks. Diesel engines won't start if they're too cold. Fires can only do so much. And they give away troop positions and bring down artillery and drone-strikes.

They did this by isolating the population, creating the guide book for spreading propaganda, and training their children from a young age to prepare for the next war.  The German soldiers that took part in the fighting in 1939 were literally raised to conquer Europe.

Putin is probably thinking that he can accomplish the same tactic, but knows that he needs to keep looting other countries to bring Russia up to snuff.  Ukraine was going to be his Czechoslovakia, but he jumped the gun while his army wasn't ready.  He could've kept the separatist enclaves as staging points for later, and used the money from oil drilling in the Black Sea to finance his future conquests, but he got greedy.  

There is no victory for him in Ukraine.  At best he destroys the cities, alienates the vast majority of the population, and has destroyed what little remained of Russia's international reputation.  Add to that how piss poor Russia's military has performed and you have a dictatorship that will be stuck in Russia w/ nowhere to go.

They started w/ 170K troops just from Russia itself.  They've lost at least 11K KIA, and there's probably triple that wounded to the point they're out of the fight.  In two weeks they've lost 40K worth of troops, and the Ukrainians have scavenged so many Russian vehicles that they actually replaced most of the losses they incurred at the start of the war.  20K worth of foreign volunteers even joined up w/ the Ukrainian Army and more are probably arriving as we speak + whatever clandestine NATO personnel are taking part in operations.  It's also important to note that the invasion force isn't entirely combat troops, only a minority of that number is for combat operations, and throwing support guys into attacks just further undermines Russian logistics.

This is NOT sustainable by any means.  It would've been one thing if say just 2000 Russian soldiers died in combat, but having to send out 11,000 death notices + the wounded's notifications makes this even more difficult for the government to conceal.  Imagine how many more of those notices will go out in another two weeks, and then imagine what that looks like after trying to invade the cities themselves w/ undertrained and undersupplied troops.  Every hour that Russia stays in country they lose millions of dollars in manpower, material, and desperately needed vehicles.  Not to mention military officers that aren't easily replaced.

Putin already tried asking the other nations allied w/ him to send troops, and they completely declined.  Which means not only is he fuming over them turning his order down after he kept them from getting overthrown, he now thinks that they may consider doing what Ukraine is doing after the sorry state of affairs the Russian Army is in.  He's a paranoid dictator whose starting to understand that the fear he instills in people is eroded every day he can't break Ukraine.  Meanwhile Russia has maybe a week before citizens start to notice grocery stores getting more and more empty.  The franchises Russia just seized aren't sending product over, Wall Street banks are refusing to invest in the country, and even China just decoupled their currency from the ruble.

The Russians have bitten off way more than they can chew here, and there's never going to be a situation where Putin can hold a victory parade in Kyiv, if he can even leave his home country ever again.

The ensuing outbreak of the disease resulted in the deaths of at least 66 people, although the exact number of victims remains unknown. The cause of the outbreak was denied for years by the Soviet authorities, which blamed the deaths on consumption of tainted meat from the area, and subcutaneous exposure due to butchers handling the tainted meat.

 >The 1999–2000 battle of Grozny was the siege and assault of the Chechen capital Grozny by Russian forces, lasting from late 1999 to early 2000. The siege and fighting left the capital devastated. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth. Between 5,000 and 8,000 civilians were killed during the siege, making it the bloodiest episode of the Second Chechen War.
 
**[Siege of Sarajevo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo)** 
 
 >The Siege of Sarajevo (Serbo-Croatian: Opsada Sarajeva / Опсада Сарајева) was a prolonged blockade of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the Bosnian War. After initially being besieged by the forces of the Yugoslav People's Army, the city was then besieged by the Army of Republika Srpska from 5 April 1992 to 29 February 1996 (1,425 days). It lasted three times longer than the Battle of Stalingrad and more than a year longer than the siege of Leningrad, and was the longest siege of a capital city in the history of modern warfare.

Ukraine is a major source of chicken meat in Europe and has suffered a lot of outbreaks recently.  Bird flu is endemic among wild bird populations and is found all over the globe.  Wild migrating ducks and geese carry it naturally and spread it around, it's particularly lethal to poultry.  These labs will have bird flue samples in freezers for testing purposes because thats how it works.  The supposed 1.6 million that came from the US for these labs is peanuts, it's barely enough to buy supplies and pay for staff for a basic bird flu testing lab let alone a bioweapons lab.",False,1646980983.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i07l6or,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

I say this with all due respect: maybe make a grocery list and go shopping once a week instead of every other day. Buy generic instead of name brand products to offset costs. Switch to a cheaper phone plan (Google Fi is half what I was paying Verizon). Cut off cable services and stream. Plant food instead of flowers/grass. I understand the need to commute, but there are multiple ways we can work to find a balance.  Maybe instead of looking to a politician you obviously don't trust to solve problems, reduce the amount of time spent driving and consuming various resources we complain about having the privilege to consume.

Those actions and weapons systems led to a US military that could defeat Russia without a single US life lost in Afghanistan; and eventually led to the humiliation of the USSRs military

>The role of Secretary of Defense Harold Brown in managing the Pentagon, boosting the military and confronting the Soviet Union during the Jimmy Carter Administration is examined in a new Department of Defense historical volume that was declassified and published this month.

>It was during Secretary Brown’s tenure that the Carter Administration reversed a decline in defense spending and began a military buildup that is usually associated with the Reagan Administration. Stealth aircraft, precision bombs, cruise missiles and other new weapons programs were championed by Brown, a physicist, and brought into production.

>“Unlike previous secretaries of defense, Brown faced the Soviet Union at the apex of its Cold War military might,” wrote historian Edward Keefer in the new DoD volume. “Flush from new discoveries of oil and natural gas in an era of high energy prices, the Soviet Union of the Carter years came closer to matching the United States in strategic power than it had in any other period. By most reckonings, the Kremlin held advantages over the West in conventional weapons and forces in central Europe. Brown and his staff worked diligently and creatively to offset the formidable Soviet military challenge. Yet the achievements Brown amassed as secretary have been overshadowed by one horrendous failure, the Iran hostage rescue mission. As a result, history has paid scant attention to his successes. Similarly, it has ignored the foundation that the Carter administration built for the Reagan revolution in defense. This volume aims to remedy the oversight.”

>“This is an authorized history, but not an official one,” wrote DoD Chief Historian Erin R. Mahan. “There is a distinction.” That is, it is based on authorized access to classified source materials and underwent internal peer review, but it represents the author’s own judgment.

>Among other areas of friction and public controversy, Secretary Brown defended the nuclear weapon targeting policy set forth in Carter’s Presidential Directive 59. “To liberal arms control advocates, such as the Federation of American Scientists, PD 59 seemed warlike and dangerous,” the Pentagon history said.",1646959411.0,1646959196.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i06gtuq,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

Only then are you air assets effective in a combat zone. Even then your Air Force will take losses from shoulder launched SAM’s like Stingers and even RPG’s. Even Javelin anti tank missiles are a threat, mostly to helicopters, because of their free fire mode.

Anyway, a lot of people saw the effect of AirPower in previous conflicts then assume that could be applied to this war. Israel was able to devastate several enemies during the Six Day War using mainly their Air Force, but they established air superiority before the conflict on the ground even started.

Russia tried the puppet president thing on them and they threw him out on his ass.

Ukraine is the country that finally said no, absolutely not, and if you want it to be that way you can come here and try to kill us and make it that way. 

until someone did that, Russia was going to continue rolling over Eastern Europe and central Asia and everywhere that they could.

No NATO or EU country could do it, it had to be a country that stood the risk of being stomped by Russia without help - those are the places they have directly targeted with their own military, where it's not a proxy and they can't claim that they're not behind it.  

They've bribed and meddled in NATO/EU countries to enable this, with politicians and media weakening, delaying, and muddying the response to their actions - sometimes agreeing with them.  

until a country said no, and forced them to take the mask of a modern nation off and show themselves for the pure robbery-dictatorship they have been under Putin, this was going to continue  

Ukraine has made themselves a *lot* of friends through this, earned an unbelievable level of goodwill. 

This is the geopolitical version of the tiananmen square tank man, the world is seeing it happen live, and we are giving him an AT4 without hesitation this time. 
This will not be forgotten & Ukraine's bravery is going to be cherished for a long time throughout eastern Europe especially, but everywhere that's been the target of Russian and Soviet invasions, meddling, propaganda, sabotage.

It was caused by Russia installing a RU-friendly puppet president in Ukraine (Yanukovych), who was unanimously ousted by Parliament following a popular (though Western-encouraged) uprising.

6fbf0be3796ad9739feb1a7dcb52a014,tbbi82,i07elrd,"I think the issue is more complicated to the point that it's believable that this could accidentally happen. As an example, with the [Wuhan Institute of Virology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_Institute_of_Virology) there were republicans that found scientists who claimed the work that the government funded was gain-of-function research.  Is that true? I don't know, it's really out of my area of work, but I could understand how that would happen.

As an example, let's think about racial discrimination in machine learning. One example that has been provided in the past is that ""a camera that detects if it should provide soap that sometimes fails for people of a different skin color is racial discrimination."" And, I think you would find a divide of scientists who claim that it's not discrimination, while you would find a majority who do claim it is discrimination.  (ex. statistically, people of the failing skin color will show up as having health problems, which is where it becomes apparent that there is really a bad problem)

Though, in that example, while it is more clear cut, this divide gets blurry with other technologies. ex. is the facial recognition that we funded for public research for better phone security now a national security problem because an authoritarian country is using it to track people everywhere? As another example, if the government was funding research at a lab, and while they were funding that lab, that lab was conducting research for a military, is it also a contributor to the bad research?

In my opinion, it can get confusing, but **none of this matters right now because gain-of-function research isn't advanced yet.** And, it really doesn't help that in the last two years, we had a political party in the United States highly contributing to the claims of the scientists that were claiming gain-of-function research was happening in a country that is a potential enemy of the United States",False,1646975471.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i07c9hr,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Was there collateral damage? Yes, but the US tried to make things right by paying people to replace their damaged property, etc. We also made sure that certain targets were off limits. It made it harder to get people when they can just go hide in a mosque or a school, but people also didn't want to attack a mosque or a school.

The US has faults but we at least tried not to fuck everything up. Did we succeed, no, we still fucked things up, but we didn't intentionally target civilians. If people did that, they are probably in Leavenworth right now, because we have laws and we follow them.

The Russians are different. They literally don't care. They're targeting hospitals and schools and churches. They're attacking women and kids, mining humanitarian escape routes, attacking humanitarian convoys.

The appearance of empathy disappears as soon as people think they might be affected themselves. It's easy to change icons to flags of Ukraine and post SlAva UkRaiNe everywhere. It's easy to write a check and tell Ukraine to figure it out themselves. 

But when Ukraine asks for the kind of help that might mean we put ourselves at risk, watch all that empathy go flying out the window. 'But this might affect *me*, that's going too far!' Not a risk via a draft, not a risk of being sent overseas, but the theoretical risk of a theoretical nuclear strike, usually with a reference to a movie, tv show, or video game. A threat drawn from media depictions is enough to see where people's support ends.

So people will continue to die. And a lot of Westerners will sit from the comfort of their homes, posting endless memes about how they totally support Ukraine by going on long screeds about how awesome Zelenskyy is, but the minute Zelenskyy says anything about how checks and missiles aren't enough, how they need more help because they're getting fucking slaughtered, watch the screeds change to 'How dare he, the ungrateful coward!

I'm not, I was working in the field at the time.  Precision cruise missiles allowed the US to target Russian silos and trains with cruise missiles using conventional warheads, which allowed the US to shift targeting of nuclear weapons to Soviet cities; see Harold Brown.  Both the conventional cruise missiles and  nuclear weapons could be delivered by B2s that could fly undetected deep into Russian air space.  The B2 was a huge game changer, the cancelation of the B1 program was met with cynical political criticism, but a few of us knew what was about to come online; and months later the B2, then later the F117, developed under Carter and Brown, but first revealed in the late 1980s.

A. Let's break this down. If Russia used nuclear weapons, would you assume a singular or a few tactical nukes, just a little one or two in a non-NATO country as a test to see their engagement after that and get the West to back off? Modern nuclear weapons don't really kill millions in single bomb. The radiation after maybe. I think he goes this route over mass launch.

I think you're assuming that he is gonna just launch the whole arsenal. That would be the way billions die, multiple warhead launches and then the responding launches from NATO. If you think he and everyone else in the chain of nuclear launch is ready to die, I don't. There isn't some big red button to push.

B. My reasons really are many, so brace yourself. I addressed it in another, older comment so I will copy paste and add to it.

>I'm not sold on the madman with the nuclear codes bit he's running. It's theater. He can only properly wield the nuclear threat if it comes from the leader of a nuclear power who has become unhinged. Conveniently, we are then presented with carefully curated ""glimpses behind the scenese"" serving as demonstrations of his increasing anger and loss of reasoning acumen:

 >1. The outburst on live TV at his high-ranking subordinate, who is shown quivering in fear. But metadata analysis showed that was a pre-recorded segment, not live at all. So why show it?

 >2. The convenient leaks from the meeting at the Urals, which report him as becoming increasingly unhinged, which are reminiscent of scenes ripped straight from the movie Downfall, only to be distributed widely over social media. 

 >3. The photo of his two top generals looking grave and dismayed at the nuclear alerts. Then the subsequent, highly publicized firing of one of them. 

>Only a rational actor would go out of their way to carefully craft this sort of theater, and only a rational actor would conclude that the only way to achieve an effective nuclear annhilation threat in the service of one's goals would be to stage a play for the world to see.

>I could be wrong, but I'm convinced it's all so much smoke and mirrors, and this is the purview of an ex-spymaster.

>Edit: TL;DR: Putin is crazy like a fox (idiom translation for non-native English speakers: cunningly acting crazy, not actually crazy, in the service of a particular aim) and he's not gonna use nukes, he's trying to instill fear and terror to stymie the world's response. 

>He threatens nukes and we're supposed to shit ourselves in fear instead of aiding Ukraine.


D. Russia is conscripting another at 130k soldiers April 1. Military personnel reserves are a million plus. They certainly have the personnel to continue, and the equipment (although maybe some just on paper) and a lack of willingness or ability to engage the full strength of their AF means they have some in reserve. It's possible most of their equipment is in poor condition, it's also possible that some of their forces are held in reserve to be deployed at later dates. We also know that Ukraine isn't the end of ambitions, Moldova and Transinitria are next. 

E. The greater the risk, the more you should fear is a mindset that works well for Russian interests. The whole play here is to make the threat so massive...""billions will die!"" so that you have to hesitate, or choose not take action...this is the only way it works. The threat must be great for it to be effective. If you bow to the risk though, you're essentially making things worse as you're just incentivizing more of these same behaviors except they'll have to keep upping the risk profile later. Later they may *have* to prove it.",1646976107.0,1646975593.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i07caiy,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

>In response, on 22 August 1980 the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.[14]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit

>President Carter appointed Brown Defense Secretary in 1976; the first scientist to hold that position. Though he had a mandate from Carter to reduce defense spending, Brown laid the technological groundwork for many of the “second offset” technologies that underwrote US military dominance from the 1980s-2010s, such as stealth, cruise missiles, satellite guidance, advanced propulsion, and advanced sensors. He also persuaded Carter to seek a substantially larger defense budget in the last year of that administration. He was not persuaded of the effectiveness of the B-1 bomber, however, and canceled that program in favor of equipping B-52s with Air-Launched Cruise Missiles and investing in the Advanced Technology Bomber, which became the B-2 stealth bomber. He also approved development of the M-X missile, intended to be the successor to the Minuteman, and persuaded NATO allies to accept the deployment of Pershing II and Griffin land-based theater nuclear missiles on their soil.

I’m not upset because you said some war coverage might be emotionally manipulative. I corrected you on a very specific piece of coverage which you had not even seen, argued that you’re insane for implying that if they did broadcast it for that reason they would be just as much monsters as Putin’s regime is for what they’re doing, and have been defending that argument ever since. Never in this thread have I gotten emotional about it, you just assume that because once again it’s the only way for you to pretend like you’re still in control of this discussion. 

Funny how your only counter remains that somehow I’m emotionally unstable because I actually take the time to write an actual reply and argument. Just like you did with someone else in this thread.

Trumps pointless Tariffs hurt America more than China. It's weird you can't look up they damage they did when it's so easy to find. Oh well I won't spoon you. Interesting that you chose a date 2 months before Trump was sworn in and tariffs and not the dates of those massive drops after he enacted his pointless tariffs. You know the historical bad months under Trump?

I think your brain working well is debatable, since it's shortcircuited by your lizard brain emotions. It's normal, it happens, but you must find a way to gain control of yourself. You don't seem very confident or well-read in this state.

Second point: you're changing the goalposts with that question. No one, but no one is ever invading Russia. End of. Not up for debate, won't happen. Establishing a UKR no-fly zone is not invading Russia, so let's not be sneaky and conflate those two circumstances. Invading Russia would be the circumstances that they would use nukes for.

Try reading before making silly statements:

>By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986,[352] the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.[353]



>Tensions continued to intensify as Reagan **revived the B-1 Lancer program, which had been canceled by the Carter administration, produced LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles,[354] installed US cruise missiles in Europe, and announced the experimental Strategic Defense Initiative,** dubbed ""Star Wars"" by the media, a defense program to shoot down missiles in mid-flight.[citation needed] The Soviets deployed RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, **under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe,** primarily West Germany.[355] **This deployment placed missiles just 10 minutes' striking distance from Moscow.[356]**

>**After Reagan's military buildup, the Soviet Union did not respond by further building its military,[357] because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for the Soviet economy.[358]** At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production,[359] even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production.[Q] These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues.[346] **Issues with command economics,[360] oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.[citation needed]**",False,1646962014.0,t3_tbbi82,t1_i06msaj,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

It has to be the right escalation, so why doesn't the US government just ask you since you can surely be so precise? They're already sanctioning the shit out of them but clearly they know that providing specific weaponry or soldiers is off the table. But that's what you want and you think you know better than them?! You're ridiculous.

You're arguing for calling putins bluff when he genuinely believes the Ukraine being within their interest is worth fighting for and you think he'll just concede but there's no guarantee.
