https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1497564078897774598?t=jyB8E5w1V8g_Z0A8yhoveA&s=19


Edit:

This is HUGE because it is a measure normally preserved for war. Will look up the charters, but under normal circumstances, Turkey closing the straits to a country is semi-equivalent to a declaration of war.


Edit 2: treaty mentioned is the Montreux Convention of 1936. The article that Turkey bases itself on is 19.2. Text of the treaty can be found [here](https://treaties.un.org/pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280166981)


Edit 3: After doing some research, I found no information on how many times this article has been activated. That could mean never, that could mean a lot. Nevertheless, this decision signifies a 180 from the Turkey foreign policy, as just two days ago, their foreign minister said Turkey was unable to close the straits. [Source](https://treaties.un.org/pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280166981)


Edit 4: HISTORIC CONTEXT AND SIGNIFICANCE

The historic context learns however that from the very inception of this treaty, almost 100 years ago, Russia and the USSR were heavy against the treaty.

The very existence of it even directly lead to the admission of Turkey to Nato. So this goes back all the way to the very outset of the first Cold War. 

And there is no certainty that Russia will respect the treaty and won't try to force a change as it has done so many times in history. This is a potential very explosive situation.

And to put it all more in explosive perspectives: it's actually banning Russian warships from THE BLACK SEA. So it's also uncertain how they handle the already presence of warships in the Black sea, which is the case now.



Edit 5: the story is now breaking also on BBC. Watch them for better coverage.


Edit 6: CORRECTION

There might be misunderstanding. While Zelensky has claimed the decision, Turkish officials still need to confirm the decision. We urgently need clarity on this, exactly because it is so explosive. Imagine Russia acts on it.  [Source](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1497573623619538946?t=0FAy0owivxpgWtszQmFNRw&s=19)

> Awakenings don’t come any ruder than the one Russian president Vladimir Putin, by invading Ukraine, delivered this week to Berlin.

> Until Thursday morning German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock insisted that Berlin’s dual path – of diplomacy backed by sanction threats – was the correct one with Russia. By Thursday evening her palpable outrage – at growing civilian casualties and a flagrant breach of the international order – culminated in an expression of how, until the end, Moscow had duped her.

> “We have to say we were lied to,” she said in a television interview, her voice trembling. “They stone-cold lied to us.”

> Official German shock, surprise and, now, regret over its political approach with Moscow have all sparked anger in neighbouring Poland and its Baltic neighbours.

> In Warsaw a bit of gallows humour doing the rounds on Friday about Berlin’s take on Russia drew on the wisdom of cartoon character Homer Simpson: “It takes two to lie: one to lie and one to listen.”

1. Presidential appeal: Zelensky also appealed to Ukrainians to resist the invasion, and called for those living abroad to return and defend the country. He also welcomed volunteers from abroad, saying, ""we will give you weapons.""
2. Fighting on the streets: Early Saturday, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry warned active fighting was taking place and urged residents to stay calm, hide indoors, take cover and head to the nearest shelter if they hear air raid sirens. The mayor of Kyiv has imposed an overnight curfew from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m., until February 28.
3. Apartment building struck: A residential building was hit by a missile or rocket early Saturday as many in the city slept, with images and video showing extensive damage to apartments, with outer walls torn away completely. The cause of the strike and extent of casualties is not yet known.
4. Ukrainians flee: More than 120,000 Ukrainians have already left while 850,000 are internally displaced, according to the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees. She said up to 4 million Ukrainians could flee if the situation continued to deteriorate, and that there were queues at a number of border crossings,
5. International step-up: The US offered to evacuate President Zelensky from Kyiv, but he refused saying, ""I need ammunition, not a ride."" He also called on Hungary and Germany to support blocking Russia from the international payments system SWIFT, a strong sanction he said was now supported by most EU states.
6. Strategic link shelled: The sound of shelling impacts hit around the city of Kherson, Ukraine, north of the Crimean peninsula, on Saturday morning. The bridge connecting Russian-held areas to Ukraine was later blanketed in smoke, through which a CNN team saw apparent armored vehicles moving toward Ukraine.

I thought that German Finance Minister Linder had agreed to block Russia's access to SWIFT?

**EDIT:** before someone accuses me of being a bot, I speak German. According to the German newspaper Zeit, 26. Februar 2022, 14:51 Uhr, only Germany is against SWIFT sanctions against Russia right now.

And I definitely recall that Lindner had agreed to SWIFT sanctions, so I'm confused.  That's what I read on Friday. [https://finanzmarktwelt.de/swift-finanzminister-lindner-deutschland-bereit-russland-auszuschliessen-226953/](https://finanzmarktwelt.de/swift-finanzminister-lindner-deutschland-bereit-russland-auszuschliessen-226953/) It states that Lindner is definitely putting this on the table, and so I'm wondering whether there's a rift between the Chancellor and his Finance minister.",1645885286.0,1645884934.0,t3_t1x4qt,t3_t1x4qt,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Few things I've noted:

First. Please note that coverage from RT is undisputedly Russian propaganda, do not take it as factual.

&#x200B;

1. They have recently started referring to the invasion as a invasion. Previously they called it a 'military operation'.
2. They have started to report in a more neutral fashion, likely due to reports that European countries are looking to ban RT
3. They are heavily covering the 'genocide' in the Donbas region
4. They are reporting that the Azov battalion are setting up defences in densely populated civilian areas. They are calling this a terrorist tactic and they are saying that it's being done under the supervision of the Americans
5. They are reporting that the border patrol guards from Snake island are alive and well and are in Crimea
6. They have started to cover international response to the invasion
7. They have started to cover international reaction to RT and the lack of unbiased reporting

1. Yes Russia has thermobaric weapons and may very well use them. That doesn't change much of the situation in Ukraine.

2. All EU nations have agreed to remove Russia from SWIFT. Now they just have to enact it.

3. Kyiv has not been taken and while the fighting is fierce it does not look Kyiv is falling anytime soon.

4. Russia has threatened other Non-NATO and NATO countries but until he actually takes action against them militarily there won't be NATO troops fighting.

5. While it is reasonable to want countries like Germany and Italy to be much more strong on sanctions unfortunately they can't always do that without first considering the broad repercussions to their citizens. Do I still want them too? Yes. Is it understandable that they are considering their citizens? Also yes.

6. No Russia has not sent all their troops into Ukraine. Estimates for Troops currently still at the border are 1/2 to 2/3 of the 200,000 original troops. There are numerous reasons to do this. Sending troops in waves to secure the rear as troops take land. Keeping reserves as fresh replacements when units get tired and/or depleted.

7. Anything that comes out of the Kremlin or Russian approved news sources is an invalid source and cannot be treated as the truth in any way.

8. Putin cannot unilaterally launch nuclear weapons. While his ministers are obviously on his side, deciding upon nuclear Holocaust is much different than a traditional war. Propaganda is strong, self preservation is stronger.

However, this reality continues to push the world towards a larger war. Short of a loss of power in Russia, Putin will not relent. Whether predicated by a false flag attack against its own citizens or not, he will escalate the violence. Pressure will increase on Ukraine's partners to intervene directly, and we should be clear-eyed about it: the likelihood the West can enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine without this turning into a hot conflict with Russia is near zero.

That doesn't mean the West shouldn't or won't.

>* 2/7 Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

>* 3/7 The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

>* 4/7 If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

>* 5/7 Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.

>* 6/7 Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.

>* 7/7 The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!

THREAD 1/7 Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin’s lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.

2/7 Russians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.

3/7 The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.

4/7 If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.

5/7 Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.

6/7 Russia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.

7/7 The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance! #StandWithUkraine

8/7 Spread this information so the world would realise how important it is to assist Ukraine right now and without hesitation! It is difficult for Russia, but it is difficult for Ukraine as well if the West does not provide meaningul support!

They are just disappointed that a country that has so much influence and power to aid Ukraine and help end this war, has decided to be selfish and value their future relationship with Russia in order to protect their current  energy interest. 

German government has picked a stance, which is they don't want to be seen actively aiding and helping Ukraine's defense or harming Russia too much.   Right now, Olaf is actively preventing SWIFT sanctions, and  blocking EU and NATO from supplying Ukraine with offensive arms if it include a German made part, which is A LOT.  The only aid they could muster up were a few thousand helmets, which is laughable.  Germany is clearly thinking strategically about what comes after this war, and they need Russia and their oil and gas, more than they need sovereign Ukraine.

I find it quite surprising that people take this viewpoint, because Reddit is pretty much a propaganda hub, and it is filled by young people.

I mean, not in relation to this war. It is bad. However, across political subs, news subs, even history subs, etc.

Reddit is absolute proof that young people can buy into propaganda, and often not realise they have bought into it. If something becomes part of the accepted thought pattern on Reddit, that becomes the 'Reddit Truth' and attempting to go against that will always resulted in severe downvotes resulting in a shadowban/hidden post. Very rarely does the 'Reddit Truth' match up with reality.

So, don't think cutting off social media as a 'good' thing. It is still bad, because it provides less of an opportunity to inform people about the true state of things.",False,1645883221.0,t3_t1x4qt,t3_t1x4qt,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

\-----


  
**1. contact your Congressional representatives and the White House, and vocalize your strong support for continued military and humanitarian aid packages to Ukraine. Also, please explicitly mention that you support the U.S. withdrawing Russian access to SWIFT.** 


  
Find your representative: [https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)


  
What is SWIFT and why does this matter?: [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60521822](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60521822)


  
**2. consider individual donations to help support Ukrainian citizens.** 
  


Donations to the International Red Cross or the specific Ukrainian emergency appeal can be found here and here: 
  
[https://www.icrc.org/en/donate](https://www.icrc.org/en/donate)   
[https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/ua/donate/\~my-donation?\_cv=1](https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/ua/donate/~my-donation?_cv=1) 
  

  
Another option is United Help Ukraine; this non-profit is using donated funds to provide food and medical supplies to displaced Ukrainian citizens, as well as providing financial support for wounded Ukrainian soldiers as well as the families of wounded or killed soldiers during this conflict:

In college I was doing my thesis when I got sidetracked conducting a comparative analysis of pigeon and human behavioral studies. I worked at an open air Cafe at the time, so every day there were pigeons around doing pigeon things like eating crumbs off the table. Over time I got to know the individual pigeons that hung around that area and observed their mannerisms in hopes of supplementing my perspective. 

There was one exceptionally large pigeon, clearly well fed from the Cafe scraps, who was extremely aggressive to the other pigeons when it came to food. A dropped scone would be jealously guarded and he would chase any other pigeon that got close. 

Most pigeons just shove eachother out of the way absentmindedly or may briefly scuffle, but the large pigeon was reliable. He would always run out every other pigeon for every single scrap and actively attack them over every morsel.

Of course, there were more 'regular' pigeons than the large one, so while he aggressively ran down one pigeon, the rest would jump at the chance to grab at the rest of the food while he was distracted until he brought his attention back to chase off another pigeon.

So while the large pigeon's aggression did result in him getting more food than the other pigeons, he also had to spend more time and energy being aggressive to get there. His own aggression detracted from eating.

I then realized that the fat pigeon is trapped in a behavioral cycle of violence. Being aggressive led to him getting more food and being well fed, but now that he is large, he now also has a larger caloric cost, so to upkeep his size he needs to eat more, which means being more aggressive. He is now aggressive because he has to be, and has no way to stop.

Now when I look at this situation, I see a fat pigeon desperate for more crumbs to feed the beast. We ask why this madness when it is not madness, it is desperation. The pigeon body has been tacitly content these past two decades with how the beak has gotten its food, but there is always another meal after the last, and so the pigeon must use their beak to constantly peck at their neighbors for more. Aggression is desperation, so when I see this attack I ask: why so desperate?",False,1645886159.0,t3_t1x4qt,t3_t1x4qt,,0,0,0,0,1,0,

Chechenya is pretty much a semi independent dictatorship within russia (I find it very hard to believe 97% of the chechens voted for kadyrov, no one gets 97% in an election) that holds on to power by, amongst other things, having a definitely-not-terrorist-like militia.

Think of Chechenya as a less extreme (and with the recognition of the russian state) ISIS caliphate. The  human rights  situation in chechenya makes the rest of russia look like sweden in comparison.

Here's a quote (taken from wikipedia so, grain of salt and all that) from ramzan kadyrov.

Ukraine is capable of killing anything Russia has. With more arms on the way.

Russia will be increasingly low on supplies.

They haven't taken any major city centers, and we haven't seen anywhere near the light infantry needed to do so. Go watch how American and Israelis go through cities. Then watch these fucking clowns driving around seperated and lost.

The Russian morale is clearly low, Ukrainian is crazy high with no signs of cracking.

Ukraine is way out in front in terms of intelligence, in basically all it's forms.

Where is this Russian victory going to come from? I don't see it. And you can check my comment history. I was bullish for Ukraine before this thing even kicked off.

Ukrainian soldiers defy Russian advance on Kharkiv using British anti-tank missiles

He sat propped against a concrete vent, one leg straight, the other crooked, eyes closed as if he were resting.

But the young Russian soldier did not breathe or move. And nor did the woman in civilian clothes lying in the snow next to him.

Both were covered in blood. Both were among the first casualties of Vladimir Putin’s insane assault on Ukraine.

Russia’s First Guards Tank Army crossed the border just 25 miles from Kharkiv in the early hours of Thursday morning in one of the most violent assaults of the invasion.

Its attempt to quickly envelop the city was stopped in its tracks when an advanced Russian unit charging around the city’s ring road ran into an ambush laid by Ukrainian troops equipped with British anti-tank missiles.



“The tank – that was an NLAW,” said a Ukrainian soldier speaking Russian at the scene of the fight on Thursday afternoon. “How do you say in English ‘God save the Queen?’”

Here was proof that British military aid is effective. The tank’s turret was blown clean off and lay blackened in the middle of the intersection, its cannon embedded in the tarmac.



A Russian armoured personnel carrier that had careered off the road stood where it stopped, its hatches open and scraps of evidence – Russian ration packs, uniform badges, maintenance logs – left on the ground where curious Ukrainian soldiers had picked through them.

The soldiers shared out trophies – a copy of the Russian military legal codex, unit patches and cards with the mobile phone number and name of the same man: presumably a Russian officer responsible for the soldiers in the column.

The young Russian they left alone in the quiet corner where he died of his wounds, next to the civilian woman caught in the crossfire. No one wanted to disturb them.

The skirmish here was a small but morale-boosting victory for an outgunned and outnumbered army who many military analysts predicted would crumble in the first hours of a Russian assault.

But underneath their professional coolness, there is obvious strain on the faces of the soldiers holding the outskirts.

They know that the Russians can come again at any moment. And they know that massive artillery fire could be brought to bear.

They do not like to discuss their own losses and the Ukrainian general staff is not releasing estimates of its own casualties.

But the bombardments that hit military bases here in the early hours of Wednesday were intense. Many Ukrainian soldiers have certainly already been killed. The Telegraph saw a long convoy of ambulances leaving the city via one of the still open roads on Thursday morning.

Nonetheless, the opening stages of Russia’s assault seem to have been based on optimistic planning.

They initially tried to make use of the roads rather than go cross country, favouring speed of advance over force protection, and have not unleashed the full force of their artillery to clear the way – perhaps assuming that low Ukrainian morale would see the defending army melt away.

If so, it was a miscalculation.

A breakout from Crimea in the south has made rapid progress, reaching the city of Kherson.



On Thursday afternoon, the Russians positioned themselves on Kharkiv’s northern edge and contented themselves with hurling shells and rockets at the city.

Air raid warnings were sounded several times throughout the day and heavy artillery bombardments of what sounded like the impact of multiple rocket-launch systems could be heard from the city centre.

It was not immediately clear what they were aiming at.

The ring road remained mostly under Ukrainian control, and at least two highways into the city from the West and South were still open, allowing civilians to leave and enter unmolested.

Vladimir Putin and his generals are hoping to seize the capital Kyiv and destroy the Ukrainian Government to force surrender or collapse of resistance elsewhere.

If Kyiv does not fall, quickly, the assault on Kharkiv may begin anew. The fear is Russian generals may revert to more orthodox methods of overwhelming artillery fire, turning the city into Stalingrad or Grozny.

Attacking Kharkiv epitomises the lunacy of Vladimir Putin’s war and his claim to be “liberating” Ukraine.

A Russian-speaking city with a huge student population, thriving heavy industry and Ukraine’s fastest growing tech hub, it is a place that should symbolise the natural friendship between the two countries.

That is why the Kremlin has told its public that the current war is an operation in Donetsk and Luhansk. It knows ordinary Russians will not understand why their own army is shelling their aunts, uncles and cousins.

As Russian multiple-rocket launch systems and ballistic missiles smashed into the city’s defences on Wednesday and Thursday, thousands of people hurried to shelter in the Soviet-built metro stations, much like the Londoners who once sheltered from the Blitz.

“I did not think I would ever see anything so f—--d up in my lifetime,” one woman said in a video from a crowded metro station. There is no better summary of what is happening here.

As darkness fell on Thursday night, uncertainty hung over the city.

Will the Russians try to fight their way in, risking a Stalingrad-like house-to-house fight for a city of 1.4 million people?

Or will they again attempt to encircle and blockade it, exploiting the city ring road for their advance deeper into Ukraine?

At the scene of Wednesday’s ambush on the ring road, soldiers nervously watched the horizon and listened to the boom of incoming rounds in the distance.

Then, closer than the distant crumps, a rapid series of reports and the whistle of incoming shells. The soldiers were face-down in the snow by the time the first exploded.



There was a pause in the explosions, a mad dash to cover, then minutes of helpless, undignified fear as ragged bangs came closer.

“I don’t know what it is. Tanks, grads, but they’re targeting me,” a Ukrainian officer shouted into a phone. “Come again? NLAW, NLAW!”

“Those guys have to keep fighting until they pick up,” muttered another.

The shelling suddenly stopped and the soldiers re-emerged and caught one another’s eyes. Our luck has not yet run out, their glances said. Will it hold next time? What about the one after that?

Only the dead Russian and the civilian woman were undisturbed, still and oblivious under soft red-dyed blankets of settling snow.

Whereas he knew that Biden wouldn’t do such a thing and it would be sanctions at worst.

Scaring zelensky to leave is obviously part of it, you can't install a puppet with any legitimacy to claim if the previous leader stands and fights. The situation in Ukraine is such that his martyrdom would be more emboldening, and rigging an election or installing a puppet becomes much harder with stiff opposition.

The fact Russia underestimated Ukraine also makes sense. All signs and analysis I've seen online says the same thing.

They've been trying to break the people's spirit, that's obvious also. 

Now the stuff about special forces being there since February 18, lack of rockets and large firepower support etc. No clue. But I am somehow doubtful that Russia of all places would only have 4 days of rockets and explosives. Maybe they didn't bring more and supply chain to transport is an issue, or maybe they're concerned about reserve munitions in case they are attacked at some point I don't know. But the idea that the military power that is Russia is worried about rationing missiles and rockets sounds unlikely to me.

Also it coming from a Ukrainian intelligence source that knows of some secret oligarchs meeting, idk, could be propaganda itself. I get Russia underestimated Ukraine but they are a major military power. And not just because of their nuclear arms. Sheer volume of troops and a ground war means eventually Russia will succeed in taking the capital.

Abstract:

*This thesis is an examination of Aleksandr Dugin’s* The Foundations of Geopolitics, *of which I have translated important sections into English and these are included as an appendix. Despite the importance of* Foundations of Geopolitics *to Russian strategic thought there has not been a translated edition published in English. This work was published in 1997 and has been quite influential for Russian political and military leadership. I strive to provide context for the setting in which* Foundations of Geopolitics *was created through an analysis of the social and political conditions that existed in Russia while the text was being written, as well as how and why it came to achieve such influence. This is followed by an analysis of the text itself. Finally, I examine the ways in which the strategic precepts offered by Dugin in* Foundations of Geopolitics *have been adopted and employed by the Kremlin in foreign and domestic policy. Additionally, I reveal the direct and indirect links connecting Dugin and his fascist Neo-Eurasianist ideology to the leaders and ideologues of fascist, far-right, xenophobic, and often racist movements. This has created a network of like-minded movements advocating for the reclamation of a traditional identity domestically, but looking to Moscow for international leadership and guidance in foreign policy. The origins of these developments can be traced back to Dugin’s* Foundations of Geopolitics.",False,1645886898.0,t3_t1x4qt,t1_hyiofmq,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

kicking Germany out of NATO is kindof self-defeating, even if they contribute absolutely nothing. The problem is kicking them out serves no purpose aside from letting them freeload even more: they're safe from Russian attack anyways for the most part since there's NATO in between. And logistics becomes a huge hassle because uh... they hold the land and airspace dividing our eastern NATO allies and the rest of the alliance. We could route through northern Poland/the Baltic sea but still, that drastically complicates things that could be done via land and also increases risk in wartime because now you're transiting through very narrow naval straits (as opposed to say, from France)

Also, Germany's current position inside NATO inherently immediately excludes them from aligning with Russia, which would be really *REALLY* bad from a military security perspective.

The truth is that dirty bombs aren't viable. Their only *real* use is that they sound super scary.

Dispersing radioactive material over a wide area does not mean hundreds of casualties being taken into hospital suffering from radiation sickness. It means rates of leukemia and thyroid cancer go up over the next 50 years and the effected area becomes a dangerous place to live.

You can't spread enough material over a wide area to cause immediate effect. Lower the area to something in which the effects are more immediately felt? Then use a conventional bomb.

Sure, I think there are valid points in this argument. I think the US was too aggressive in pushing NATO eastward and failed to prepare for the worst-case scenario, which is an all-out Russian attack. Here's my counter argument though:

1. You can't argue with the idea behind NATO. It's purely defensive. If Ukraine joined NATO, how much more of a threat it will be to Russia? Can it really start a war with Russia unprovoked? I don't think so. The other states in NATO won't allow it.
2. I think Ukraine is perfectly justified to want to join NATO. Russia is not nice to its neighbors. Look at what happened to Georgia. What happened to themselves even in 2014. Ukraine gave up its nukes. The next best thing to guarantee security is to join NATO.
3. NATO didn't force Ukraine to join. There are incentives, probably. But Russia should counter this by offering its own incentives to Ukraine. Persuade them not to join through peaceful means. Instead of waging a war.

The U.S. is weighing sanctions on Russia’s central bank, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would target much of the $643 billion reserves that President Russian Vladimir Putin had amassed ahead of a planned invasion of Ukraine.

A final decision hasn’t been made but the Biden administration is urgently considering all options in an attempt to deter Putin from further devastation in Ukraine, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The U.S. aims to make each move in conjunction with allies across Europe for maximum impact, they said.

It’s unclear how advanced those discussions are. The issue of potentially targeting the Russian central bank, however, came up in a conversation in late January, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

A White House National Security Council spokeswoman declined to comment.

While Russia has been steadily reducing reliance on foreign currency, the central bank still held 16.4% of its holdings in dollars at the end of June 2021, according to the latest official data, down from 22.2% a year earlier. The euro’s share was up at 32.2%.

The decision would be without precedent for an economy the size of Russia’s. Losing access to funds abroad could handcuff the central bank as it tries to shore up the ruble in the foreign-exchange market by selling hard currency. The direct interventions, announced earlier this week after Putin ordered his military to attack Ukraine, mark the first time it’s waded into the market since 2014.

The move would be “devastating” for Russia, according to Tim Ash, a strategist at Bluebay Asset Management in London. “We would see the ruble crash.”

Russia also kept 22% of its hoard in gold, most of which is held domestically and would be out of reach of western sanctions, while about 13% of the central bank’s holdings were in yuan.",False,1645886658.0,t3_t1x4qt,t1_hyioar5,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

And even when Russia expanded into USSR, or Hitler started invading and dominating neighbors, or USSR invaded Czechoslovakia during Prague spring- those conflicts were mostly much more mismatched, with much smaller/weaker/less developed targets with outdated military.

So tl;dr i really do believe it's possible this could be chalked up to sheer arrogance. One of the greatest geopolitical miscalculations in decades.

I mean, this is the problem with autocrats. Sometimes they are just really, really wrong. And if that happens, their whole nation can act in an incredibly obviously stupid way.

This could be Hitler-invades-USSR level miscalculation.

When Biden ordered the evacuation of the US embassy in Ukraine because they had intelligence of a February 16th attack Russia denied it and mocked it as the day passed. But soon other countries followed because they published new intelligence to show Russian troops and weapons piling up and then after weeks of denials Putin confirmed US intelligence was right and an invasion would begin.,False,1645884419.0,t3_t1x4qt,t1_hyiia2e,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

Das gilt auch für Zahlungen in das Land hinein, etwa deutsche Zahlungen für den russischen Gasexport. Die Bundesregierung befürchtet Heiz- und Stromknappheit im Fall der Maßnahme. Zudem begründete Außenministerin Annalena Baerbock den bisherigen Verzicht auf sie damit, dass die erlassenen Sanktionen gegen russische Banken zielgenauer seien.

This also applies to payments into the country, such as German payments for Russian gas exports. The German government fears heating and electricity shortages in the event of the measure.

In the first place, nothing about the book is especially prescient, and all of its assumptions and positions are (and were at the time) quite patent - for example, anyone who knows anything about the history of EU would know that Britain's position was fragile and tenuous at best, and this would have been particularly evident when Dugin's work was written. Moreover, causally attributing Brexit to Russia as some have is, to once again be blunt, incredibly facile. Take another example - it has always been the strategy of the USSR to exacerbate race tensions in America, not some amazing foresight from Dugin, and those tensions were especially prominent in the '90s (Rodney King, LA riots, etc.) Even if he did predict Crimea's annexation (he didn't, he suggested Russia take all Ukraine), the majority of Russians both then and now believed the Crimea to be Russian, so once again it isn't to his credit. Other observations are just as obvious but less specific - e.g., isolate America and support it's isolationism. That is the most self-evident strategy humanly imaginable. 

Second, people always conveniently exclude his most radical and asinine propositions - he suggested, for example, that Russia take all of Tibet–Xinjiang–Mongolia–Manchuria from China (!!) and, as compensation, help China take Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia (!!!!!) What absolute lunacy. The people posting here are more logical than that. He also suggests that all of Orthodox Europe unite with Russia, though he appears under the impression that would happen voluntarily due to similar 'collectivist' attitudes. 

Third, it's very simplistic to suggest that Dugin's work has had any considerable causal impact on Russian strategy. If anything, Dugin's book reflected obvious Russian strategy rather than formed it. But, more importantly, Dugin is not remotely held in high regard in Russia - he is seen as a mad con-man, for good reason. He is only famous in the West. He was fired from Moscow State University and now just runs his own ultra-conservative monarchist internet tv channel called 'Tsargard.'",False,1645888365.0,t3_t1x4qt,t1_hyirfs2,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
