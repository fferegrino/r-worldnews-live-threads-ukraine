üëâ On Tuesday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.  

üçÑ Ukraine continues attacking russia's logistics; tonight with an especially nice hit that [destroyed](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546962558891991041.html) Luhansk's air defense unit in what was described as a ""[massive blow](https://twitter.com/Time123On/status/1546989734739582977)"".

üëâ Ukrainian [HIMARS attacks](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546968367315111936.html) on russian logistics looks to be having an impact as [several sources](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546889031530807296.html) have noticed decreased [russian shelling](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546942688020275204.html) over the last few days.  russia's [ammunition woes](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1546745849534988289.html) have become so bad its taken to using [anti-aircraft missiles as surface to surface missles](https://twitter.com/DecodingTrolls/status/1546857576310181889).  A russian logistics column was also spotted [moving toward Kherson](https://twitter.com/noclador/status/1546854961241268224), presumably to replace some of the ammo lost in [Monday's logistics attack](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1546746946618068992) on Nova Kakhovka.

üîÑ Out of the Loop: If you've seen a bunch of Shiba Inu dogs in uniforms ripping up russian propaganda, well, the fellas are a thing and [this article](https://twitter.com/motherboard/status/1546846852267577345) helps make sense of it all.

üõë [This map](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288) will be used in my ""current state of the war"" summary as the link for ""stalemate"" because it really does show that russia has lost as much ground as it has gained in this war.  

‚úäüåª Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.   Currently russia has [no clear war objectives](https://twitter.com/A_Melikishvili/status/1546420948194234370) and has been shrinking its stated objectives since its retreat from Kyiv.

üá∫üá¶üá∑üá∫ Current state of the war: [a stalemate](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1546900881282572288) that is slowly starting to tilt in Ukraine's favor as it receives more heavy western weapons and brings more of its draftees on-line.

Day 140 of my updates from Kharkiv.

I don‚Äôt think we were shelled today, which is good, but instead they did two missile strikes instead of one. First missile strike was at 11pm, which was their usual time about 2 weeks ago. They launched at least 4 missiles, but we heard 6 explosions, couple of fires started after that. 

Then they did a second missile strike, this time at 2am. We heard 3 explosions, but apparently 4 missiles were launched from Belgorod, and one of them fell somewhere in Belgorod oblast, or at least that was what Russians wrote in their channels. A lot of their missiles seem to malfunction recently. 

So, yesterday Russians wrote that their missiles were launched from a new place. We thought that they just moved their Iskanders, but actually those missiles weren‚Äôt Iskanders this time. In the morning our police found an almost intact S-300 missile that was shot down by our AA. No wonder they fired those missiles from a different place, they were completely different missiles.

So, as Putin says, they haven‚Äôt even started fighting for real yet, but they are already using their AA missiles to strike ground targets instead of using their infinite supply of Iskanders and Kalibrs? Yeah, their army will suddenly become stronger once they run out of modern weapons. Are they saying that they won‚Äôt be able to fight for real until they switch to using muskets and flintlock pistols?",False,1657765006.0,t3_vxty6l,t3_vxty6l,,0,93,0,93,2,1,{'gid_2': 1}

From CNN's Kostan Nechyporenko and Vasco Cotovio

Ukraine hopes to speed up grain exports through the recently reopened Bystre canal of the Danube River amid Russia's blockade of its key Black Sea ports.

""In the past four days, 16 ships have already passed through the mouth of Bystre. We plan to maintain this pace,"" Yurii Vaskov, Ukraine's deputy infrastructure minister said in a statement on Tuesday.
Access to the Danube and its small inland river ports was made possible after Ukrainian forces retook Snake Island from Russian forces in June.

Vaskov added that Kyiv was negotiating with Romania and the European Commission to increase the number of ships crossing through the canal and expected congestion on the route to ""be eliminated,"" within a week ‚Äî clearing the way for Ukraine to increase its monthly grain exports by 500,000 metric tons.

More than 90 ships are waiting to enter Ukrainian ports through the Danube's Sulina channel, according to the Ukrainian Infrastructure Ministry.

Prior to Russia's invasion in February, about 80% of Ukraine‚Äôs grain was exported from its Black Sea ports, the ministry said. Now, exports leave the country exclusively through the Danube ports, railway and road checkpoints.

The capacity of the new routes is ""currently insufficient to replace seaports fully,"" the ministry said. In June, Ukraine exported about 2.5 million metric tons of goods, far short of the 8 million metric tons it had hoped to export, the ministry added.

Turkey meeting: Turkey will host talks on Wednesday with Russia, Ukraine and the United Nations on the export of grain shipments sitting in Ukrainian ports, according to the Turkish defense minister. Ukrainian officials say more than 20 million tons of grain remain stuck in Ukraine due to Moscow's blockade of Black Sea ports.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 13 July 2022
 

- In the Donbas, Russian forces will likely focus on taking several small towns during the coming week, including Siversk and Dolyna on the approaches to Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The urban areas of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk likely remain the principal objectives for this phase of the operation.

- Russia continues to seek to undermine the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state and consolidate its own governance and administrative control over occupied parts of Ukraine. Recently this has included an initiative to twin Russian and Ukrainian cities and regions to develop post-conflict administrations and a decree to make it easier for Ukrainians to obtain Russian citizenship.

- Anti-Russian sentiment in occupied Ukraine is leading to Russian and pro-Russian officials being targeted. The Russian-appointed administration in Velykyy Burluk acknowledged that one of its mayors was killed on 11 July 2022 by a car bombing. The targeting of officials is likely to escalate, exacerbating the already significant challenges facing the Russian occupiers and potentially increasing the pressure on already reduced military and security formations.

Is this war about East vs West or is actually about a power struggle between the 1st world and large 2nd world countries?

I personally think the latter.

I find it Frustrating when people (especially Russians) spin this as an old Cold War style East vs West conflict.

Communism in Russia is dead. In fact, Russia is now more Right wing than even the US. China is communist, but are not the protagonists in this war. This is not a war of ideologies like it was in the 70s and 89s.

It definitely isn‚Äôt about a geographical East vs West either. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are as Far East as it gets. 

There is an element of Democracy vs Autocracy in this confrontation. But, apart from the fact that I don‚Äôt see a truly democratic country being dumb enough to start a war in the same way that Putin has, it doesn‚Äôt seem to completely explain why Russia has invaded Ukraine. This seems to be more complicated than just Russia fearing democracy. Although I recognise that a fear of democracy seems to be a part of of Putin‚Äôs motivation. Also, other autocracies seem to either partially or wholly on Russias side.

I think the division between sides in this war, like every war, stems from more economic reasons.

Ukraine has become the battleground of the 1st versus the 2nd world.

1st world countries tend to be democratic, rich, educated, and more interconnected with other 1st world countries, both socially and economically.

Where as large 2nd world countries tend to be more autocratic, have large disparities in wealth and education, and less socially connected with other countries. Plus arguably, less economically connect as well.

1st world countries prioritise individual freedom, trade, climate change and cultural respect for minorities and other countries. In fact they celebrate their interconnectedness and dependence on other trusted allies.

Whereas large 2nd world countries tend to prioritise unity, conformity, and an intolerance to political and cultural differences. They celebrate not working with other countries, but subjugating their neighbours and increasing their own lands and interests. Often to the detriment of everyone else.

Living in 1st world countries information is much more available and reliable. In 2nd world countries, it tends to be less available, and when it is, it is usually censored by the government.

I put it to you these two world views are diametrically apart.

I wonder if resolving the issues between the 1st wand 2nd world will be essentially be the story of the 21st century.",1657713871.0,1657713590.0,t3_vxty6l,t3_vxty6l,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

So just focusing on Germany when it is most of EU really seems dumb to me too. 

Some tweeter seem to be fine with people losing their jobs during a gas crisis with high inflation of basic goods, maybe because they live on another continent that isn't affected by it so much.

Also, other autocracies seem to either partially or wholly on Russias side.

No it actually is that uncomplicated, and you could probably have stopped typing at this point.

A lot of wars have complex causes and factors and a mixture of blame to apportion. The reason for this conflict is incredibly simple.

Russia used to be have control over a smaller neighbouring country. They've lost control over that country because its people wanted the right to choose their own government rather than have Russia choose it for them. Russia doesn't like that they've lost control. Russia has decided to use military force to try to take control of that smaller country again. The Ukrainian people are fighting to keep their country free from russian control. 

That's literally it in a sentence- Big autocratic country wants control of smaller democratic country, tries to use force to get what it wants.

There's a reason why Putin's lackeys have advanced a bewildering number of conflicting explanations for its war, and there's a reason the motley coalition of qanonists, russian stooges and fanatical tankies including Schroder, Tucker Carlson, Chomsky and now Jacinda Ardern are so eager to try to overcomplicate the issue and explore the role of, amongst other things of economic power structures, the military industrial complex, globalism , NATO expansion, east-west and north south tensions, an unholy coalition of Jewish Nazism, Satanist and gay pornographers, and Hunter Biden's clandestine biolabs using weaponised covid spreading pigeons etc etc etc, because the more complicated it seems, the more likely it is people in the west might overlook the really crystal clear, some might say self evident truth at the core of this war-  that the Ukrainian people have the same basic inalienable rights as anyone, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Their current government exists to secure those rights with their consent, and they are  fighting to defend those rights from a despotic nation trying to take them away.

-Free societies tend to provide better opportunities than planned economies for genuinely exceptionally smart, creative and innovative people to gravitate to their area of expertise, and be successful in that area. Imagine, for arguments sake, the life of a Steve Jobs if he had been born with exactly the same degree of vision, technical and entrepreneurial ability but in a random middle class family in Soviet Russia. And even if, in peacetime only a tiny fraction of those sorts of people end up working on things with direct military applications, crossover is inevitable- consider for example how western military tech has benefited from the huge commercially driven advances in computer technology over the past three decades.

- private defence contractors are good at marketing, and it is in their interests to constantly offer governments more state of the art products, in some cases exploiting the media to fearmonger or exaggerate foreign capabilities to justify further spending, new capabilities and updated technology. The political dimension of defense spending in the US and the idea that potential military weakness is something that is very much a matter of public concern (ie 'the russians have more intermediate range ballistic missiles than us, why won't the president do what it takes to make ordinary americans safe?') is not something you see in an totalitarian society.

-As you say, there are bunch of practices in private industry to ensure efficient rapid production and trouble shooting on production lines- not necessarily to deliver maximum efficiency and value for money for purchasers, but because its in the interests of the owners to squeeze maximum production out of their workers for what they pay them and to keep ahead of their competitors.

And this is the thing the Putins and Xi Jinpings of the world simply don't get. They look at western countries and see disunited chaotic societies with short term, self interested politicians, wasteful and self indulgent industries devoted to leisure products, and a soft, disengaged public who distrust their own governments.

All of which is true, but the second world war provides a good example of what happens when totalitarian countries are stupid enough to provoke democracies to go to war and generate social consensus about the need to win that war.  Suddenly all the chaos and creative energy focuses on one objective, capitalists are using the methods they used to make an incrementally cheaper model to churn out bombers and fighter aircraft in unstoppable numbers, the disunited public get their blood up, get scared, then get angry and make it politically impossible for their governments to negotiate any form of peace less than total victory, and the dreamy creative types stop working on color television or a new types of refrigerator and start tinkering with the theoretically fascinating question of potential military applications of nuclear fission...",1657705229.0,1657704724.0,t3_vxty6l,t1_ifyqxo0,,2,30,0,30,0,0,

Operations and maintenance work better because the people doing it come from a culture where they are expected to be proficient at their tasks.

It also has to be said that Ukraine is still far more corrupt than..well all NATO countries. So Russia is fighting a country that is far more on its level(though it appears the last 8 years has brought some real change) than say Finland.",False,1657706986.0,t3_vxty6l,t1_ifyqxo0,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

""I'm realazing European (and even US) support to Ukraine is reliant on leaders that won't be re-elected. I think that should be taken into consideration when prospecting a multi-year war as an option.Popular support for giving weapons to Ukraine is low, as left wing pacifists and pro-russia right wingers have converging agendas on the matter and center pro-US parties/coalitions are governing Europe only thanks to extremist divisions. This war has to end by 2023 (with the best possible deal for Ukraine), or it will get worse.Russians will maybe suffer sanctions more than Europeans, but Europeans can turn their malcontent into a fair vote while Russians cannot, so I bet that the unity of the pro sanction/pro ukraine coalition can't win an ideological ""who 's dropping first loses"" kind of war. That's the same dynamics that happened in Vietnam.Only chance the west has to win is to arm Ukraine massively in advance, looking forward to the moment a shift in internal power will occur and weapon expeditions will inevitably cease.

Russia has wanted control over it's port at Sevastopol for centuries; and has even ""stolen"" Crimea from Ukraine in the past (1925-ish? - when Ukraine was an SSR). But they gave it back, (or set it up as an autonomous region under Ukraine's control).  

When Ukraine declared independence from the RF in 1991 (at the collapse of the USSR), Crimea was part of the deal, and they agreed to continue to lease Sevastopol to the Russians. 

Now, there's obviously a shit-ton of under-the-table stuff that happened between 1991 and 1997; but Ukraine was going to terminate the lease. That was a death sentence for Russia's struggling economy.   That was when Russia started really working to influence Ukraine's politics, including rigging elections. Which is how Yanukovych got into power. Yanukovych extended the lease past 2017; when Ukraine was ready to terminate it.

This is what's got Russia so flustered, and exactly why Russia annexed Crimea. 

Putin invaded in 2022 specifically because Ukraine cut off Crimea's water supply. (And why shouldn't they? that's Ukraine's water, if Russia wanted Crimea so bad, they should have gotten their own fucking water).

Russia's response?  Genocide. (again). 

The RIM-aligned (world domination) stuff is just window-dressing to keep his far-right constituents on his side. Not that those aren't real goals, but let's face it, if they can't even succeed in taking Ukraine, it's not a realistic goal.

Now Russia has any one of several valid alternatives (for the Crimea problem) to stealing other countries' resources:

 - Fucking build your own port on your own territory. Like Soichi, or wherever.
 - Build-out a better rail-network or canal system to use St. Petersberg as a port.
 - Build-out a better rail-network to exploit Russia's Eastern Coast on the Pacific. (boo-hoo, so you have to compete with China). 

Russia isn't interested in building their own infrastructure. They're content to steal others stuff, or destroy it.

The fact that Putin can't sway his kleptocrats to invest in Russia to solve Russia's economic problems, means that Putin is weak and callow, and has to resort to populist rhetoric to even get consent for genocidal war.

The general says to his assistant ""I want that hill so do this this and this"" so the assistant talks to the colonel, who hands it off to a major, who eventually hands it to the junior officers, the troops go forward, they stall outside of the hill, so the junior officers request advice from an ascending chain of officers, and around and around we go, while the guys in the front are hanging around being shot at.

I'm starting to become convinced there's a biological factor at play which separates those who are just absolutely convinced of all the false conspiracy theories as true while others assume not true unless evidence exists PROVING something as being true. 

Kind of like how scientists and doctors can now confirm for psychopaths their brain function is different and they don't have fully formed prefrontal cortex or another area of the brain, I cannot recall which area. Either that or the fear of change is so great for those who believe the false conspiracy theories that suit their wont for less change, either consciously or subconsciously.  TFG falls into this category I suspect as it's been reported he truly believes the false conspiracy theories. 

One reason I am starting to believe it's biological; many if not all of these ""believers"" in my experience will report believing all sorts of false conspiracy theories regardless their nature.

What killed it was the rush through Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donbass, Kherson, and Zaporhizia, at the same time, along with the catastrophic damage to the VDV, Spetsnaz, and other units, and Zelenskyy refusing to leave, which served to put Ukrainian morale through the roof, while Bucha and Irpin roused the support of other nations.

Russia went in on 5 fronts, when every book ever will tell you not to attempt more than 2, and a single metropolitan area can chew through tens of thousands of soldiers if the defense is stubborn enough.

 and cost them desperately needed equipment for Donbass, while the constant attacks on civilians both wasted Russian resources, and tipped the international discourse away from Russia and towards Ukraine.

Greed will not go away. If there is an opportunity to make big profits by means of Russian hydrocarbons, it will be done once the political cost of doing this business is manageable.

Wishful thinkers are keeping a low profile right now. Some of them have publicly reversed their position, but I think a lot of this might be lip service.

Maybe there will be a generation soon that is no longer hampered by the memory of living a whole life under the threat of Nuclear obliteration.

It also needs at least some liberal equality: the opening up of material and hirearchical opportunities to people who produce market-tested innovations and entrepreneurship. Economies like the US have spent the past 300+ years gradually opening up opportunities to new groups: middle-class white men, poor white men, non-white men, women etc. This means that they can draw on a larger pool of ideas and talent. She calls this ""ideasism"" - utilising more and more of the ideas-generating capacity of the population.

\-Redundant infrastructure between competing businesses. That can be good for robust service to an extent but after a point it's just wasteful.

\-Slow flow of ideas. Yes, capitalism motivates people to innovate - but copyrighted or patented ideas, which are sometimes quite easy to come up with can't easily be immediately built upon by others.

\-Advertisements try to convince people to consume with no regard for if it's in the interest of the consumer. This leads people to make bad decisions and makes for a wasteful economy. It might be productive but it isn't productive at achieving any reasonable goals for society and that in turn erodes productive capacity.

\-Advertising/Branding: We spend a lot of money trying to convince people to make often bad decisions. This isn't efficient/productive.

\-Sometimes, it makes good business sense to take a productive business, run it into the ground and cannibalize it for parts, then claim bankruptcy while the parent company makes off with a lot of wealth. (This is how Mitt Romney made a lot of money for example). That isn't productive - it's self destructive. But it makes sense in a capitalism.

\-What's in the interest of a business is often not in the interest of society. ie. Leaded gasoline, tobacco, GHG, some pesticides, carcinogenic products, designed obsolescence, containers designed so that 10% of the product won't come out of the bottle and you will need to buy more sooner even though it looked like you were getting a better deal per volume on the shelf. These set back the productivity/quality of life for society but we do them because they are good for society.

\-Did you know BMW is going to start charging monthly for using heated seats. The tech, transactions, management of that is all way less efficient than just providing a heated seat but... capitalism. 

\-Disposable products. Not many things are made to last. In the short term that's cheaper but in the long run that's inefficient. But if it looks cheaper on the shelf it will sell.

Whatever social bandwagon they jump on is strictly because its good for their revenue stream, nothing else.

I see lack of accountability as a huge problem for humankind, most people's problems were directly caused by their own decisions that freedom allows. These are usually the type that latch on to the populist so they can blame their own shortcomings on someone else.

And considering we know the hubris of Putin, I don't consider it likely he would simply abandon the war and allow Ukraine to take back its territory. I think he'd much rather mobilise and take the political hit. I don't know how politically safe he is to be able to survive such a thing, but it's my understanding he has a pretty firm grip on the country. I can make no commentary on how well it would pan out for him.

Imagine Putin going infront of his people after all his rhetoric of cleansing Ukraine, with their state TV even suggesting they go further afield and boasting of Russian superiority, just to say the war is lost. The Donbass is lost. Our economy is shattered because of this war we lost. We lost tens of thousands of your sons and fathers. By the way, we also lost that territory Crimea we captured in 2014. I don't see this going down any better.

Ala Britain in WW2. Russia's economy is doing badly, but I feel it's much more complicated to see the full picture. In the West we pay much more to manufacture combat apparel than countries that are happy to exploit their workers - just like how it's cheaper to produce products in China and ship them over, because they pay their employees peanuts and don't care as much for safety regulations, or any regulations. You can't simply look at economic figures to deduce a countries capabilities - there's much more nuance.

There's countries in the East that don't care as much about the Ukraine war as we do who may well supply them, just like we've seen with Iran giving them drones (though now in question) and India/China continuing - in some cases increasing - the trade they do with Russia. This is an oil bonanza for some of them. I imagine Russia has natural resources and reserves enough to produce light arms.

>exploiting the earth,

This I actually agree on mainly due to climate change.  However at least European capitalist countries have succefully been reducing their co2 emissions quickly.

The issue is regaldess of economic system society need energy to function and fossil fuels are easy way to get that. Also regaldess the system, exploiting only continues if the people allow it. In capitalist democratic system the people can vote people in power who are going to limit emission and in  a socialist system the explotation continues if the people are not willing to pay the cost of moving to cleaner energy sources and vice versa. Changing the economic system really doesn't solve this issue.
