> 
> In the war that began on February 24 this year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 65.4% of Latvians support Ukraine and 8.2% support Russia, according to the program ""What's Happening in Latvia?"" the results of the SKDS survey conducted by the order. More than a fifth or 21.5% of respondents do not support any of the parties involved in the war.
> 
> There is a significant difference in the treatment of the parties to the war depending on the language spoken by the respondents in the family. 90% of respondents whose family language is Latvian support Ukraine, but only 1% - Russia. Another 7% of the respondents, whose conversational language in the family is Latvian, have chosen the answer that they do not support either of the warring parties.
> 
> Among the respondents whose conversational language in the family is Russian, almost half or 46% do not support either side. 22% of respondents to Ukraine and 21% to Russia. Economist Jānis Hermanis tends to think that the very large proportion of respondents who do not support either of the parties to the war shows great embarrassment in the Russian-speaking part of Latvian society. This section of society is currently experiencing a 'moment of truth', meaning that Russia's invasion of Ukraine casts doubt on what it has long believed in.

With the invasion entering its fourth week and no let up in the fierce shelling of Ukraine’s frontline cities, US President Joe Biden called Putin a war criminal for the first time, comments the Kremlin said were “unforgivable”.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine has largely stalled on all fronts,” the UK Ministry of Defence said in an update on Thursday morning, adding that Putin’s military “continue to suffer heavy losses”.

In a further sign of US determination to support Ukraine, Biden approved the delivery of new US weapons to Kyiv, including a batch of light Switchblade drones that can be carried into the battlefield and explode when flown into targets including artillery.

There's another aspect to this problem. Russia has huge, very corrupt and very rotten political and bureaucratic class. While barons are suspicious to Moscow and can be effectively used as scapegoats, courtiers are just too expensive to maintain. They cost money, devour resources

There's no realistic way Putin will be able to keep such huge apparatus as he developed over the years of expensive oil. He bred them, but can't feed them anymore. Firing them en masse would be stupid - he'd create enemies. So the best thing to do is to launch a purge

I'm quite sure that in the near future we should be expecting mass house arrests or arrests among the bureaucrats. They can be justified through political accusations, accusations of corruption, of incompetence, whatever. But the reason would be saving money on their maintenance

> Updated on March 17, 2022, 4:31 AM EDT
> 
> Nowhere in Ukraine has Russia’s invasion gone to plan, but a combination of geography, better troops, shorter supply lines and weaker opposition means Moscow’s campaign has progressed enough in the south to show what President Vladimir Putin at least intended. 
> 
> After initial gains, the Russian military’s southern advance has met resistance in Mariupol, Ukraine’s easternmost port city, and Mykolayiv, the gateway to Odesa in the west, where the wide Bug river estuary makes a natural defensive barrier.
> 
> No less important is the political and propaganda importance of the region. Novorossiya, or New Russia -– the imperial era name for southern and eastern Ukraine -– is central to Putin’s rhetoric that the two countries form one Russian nation.
> 
> And while Russian landing craft have gathered off Odesa’s Black Sea coast several times over the last two weeks as if to attack, a sea landing would be difficult. Suitable beaches have been mined and are defended, said Shelest. On reaching the city, there’s every indication Russian troops would have to fight their way in.
> 
> Sealing Ukraine from the Black Sea in the south will likely remain a major strategic objective for Russia as long as fighting continues, according to Barrons, now chairman of Universal Defence & Security Solutions, a strategic consultancy of former military officers. Though wary of the firepower Russia still wields, he was skeptical that anything like Putin’s original plan for Ukraine is still attainable.

Posted because the mindset of the Russian political establishment, especially senior members of their security counsil, are relevant for the further course of the war and of peace talks. Do not take as an endorsement.

///

""The frenzied Russophobia of the West, apparently, will never reach the bottom. NATO expansion to our borders, the economic and information war unleashed against our country on all fronts, endless threats and intimidation, the fierce persecution of our citizens abroad. All these are the reasons for this extreme aggravation of the international situation, which the whole world is experiencing these days,"" wrote the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council.

He stressed that the line of behavior of Western countries in relation to the Russian Federation in recent years is ""disgusting, criminal and immoral."" In Medvedev's opinion, the collective West ""didn't like the fact that Russia has again become a strong power capable of defending its interests and protecting its own citizens in other countries."" He added that fierce Russophobia ""literally broke free from the chain, choking in impotent rage."" “After all, our country must be driven into a corner, put on its knees and re-educated according to the patterns of the Anglo-Saxon world. Make it weak and completely submissive. Or even better, tear it apart,” Medvedev described the line in relation to the state. “It won’t work. Russia has enough power to put in their place all the brazen enemies of our country.""

Double standarts

Separately, the deputy chairman of the Security Council spoke about the attempts of the Russian authorities to build interaction with the West. 

“We sincerely strived for good relations with them. Together we defeated fascism in the 20th century, we agreed on universal rules of security and cooperation. But now the West’s double standards no longer surprise anyone. When they need it, you can turn a blind eye to everything, including the extermination of civilians Donbass, which lasted for years. If something does not go according to their orders, there is only one culprit - our country,"" he stated.

Speaking about the large-scale anti-Russian hysteria of recent times, Medvedev noted that this is by no means a new phenomenon. “It was in the 19th and 20th centuries. Let us recall the famous words of Fyodor Tyutchev: “It has long been possible to predict that this rabid hatred, which for thirty years, every year more and more, was kindled in the West against Russia, will break ever off the chain. This moment has arrived. Russia was simply offered suicide, a renunciation of the very foundation of its being, a solemn recognition that it is nothing else in the world, like a wild and ugly phenomenon, like an evil that needs to be corrected, ""he quoted the poet, noting that one gets the feeling that these lines were written in 2022.

Cycle of History 

The Deputy Head of the Security Council drew attention to the fact that history has convincingly proved its cyclicality in the 21st century. The ground for this ""rabid hatred"" of Russia, according to him, was laid by the United States and its satellites throughout the thirty years of the existence of the new Russian state. ""It's just that for a long time it was masked by the hypocritical white-toothed smiles of politicians and diplomats who said one thing and did something completely different. Simply put, they impudently lied to us for the sake of their own interests,"" he stated.

Medvedev assured that the Russian Federation will continue to fight for the world order that suits it and its citizens, ""in which there is no place for frostbitten Nazis, historical lies and genocide."" ""Moral strength and historical truth, as before, are on our side!"" he said.

The deputy chairman of the Security Council accompanied his first entry with a comment that circumstances made Telegram channels more in demand, ""than well-known social media that compromised themselves.""

///

My takeaway is that they are increasingly framing this as an existential fight for Russia's future place in the world, and for the survival of their social and cultural identity. If that's what they sincerely belief, it doesn't bode well for peaceful compromises, neither on Ukraine, nor on the broader standoff with the West.",False,1647506498.0,t3_tg237c,t3_tg237c,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

We heard a moment ago from UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who said the UK was deploying the Sabre anti-air missile system to Poland, along with 100 troops, to protect Polish airspace from ""further aggression by Russia"".

Poland is a member of the Nato military alliance the UK is also part of.

But what is Sabre?

Described by the UK government as a ""a state-of-the-art air defence system"", it is said to be capable of hitting a tennis ball-sized object travelling at the speed of sound.

According to the British Army, the system includes three components: a 3D surveillance radar, a battle management and intelligence suit and a missile launcher.

It fires 99kg missiles that can reach speeds of up to 2,300 mph.

In practice, it will give Poland the ability to defend itself from jet fighters, missiles and bombs.

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia is sending ship full of supplies not through the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and either going around all of Africa, struggling to get through the Horn of Africa, or going through the arctic to wave at Scandinavia menacingly. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. *Putin's destroy empire any %* speedrun continues at full speed.

by Brian Klass, creator of the *Power Corrupts* podcast:

[https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-dictator-trap-russia-ukraine/627064/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-dictator-trap-russia-ukraine/627064/)

some excerpts:

>In the span of a couple of weeks, Vladimir Putin—a man recently described by Donald Trump as a strategic “genius”—managed to revitalize NATO, unify a splintered West, turn Ukraine’s little-known president into a global hero, wreck Russia’s economy, and solidify his legacy as a murderous war criminal.  
>  
>How did he miscalculate so badly?  
>  
>To answer that question, you have to understand the power and information ecosystems around dictators. I’ve studied and interviewed despots across the globe for more than a decade. In my research, I’ve persistently encountered a stubborn myth—of the savvy strongman, the rational, calculating despot who can play the long game because he (and it’s typically a he) doesn’t have to worry about pesky polls or angry voters. Our elected leaders, this view suggests, are no match for the tyrant who gazes into the next decade rather than fretting about next year’s election.  
>  
>Reality doesn’t conform to that rosy theory.  
>  
>Autocrats such as Putin eventually succumb to what may be called the “dictator trap.” The strategies they use to stay in power tend to trigger their eventual downfall. Rather than being long-term planners, many make catastrophic short-term errors—the kinds of errors that would likely have been avoided in democratic systems. They hear only from sycophants, and get bad advice. They misunderstand their population. They don’t see threats coming until it’s too late. And unlike elected leaders who leave office to riches, book tours, and the glitzy lifestyle of a statesman, many dictators who miscalculate leave office in a casket, a possibility that makes them even more likely to double down.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>\[D\]espots rarely get told that their stupid ideas are stupid, or that their ill-conceived wars are likely to be catastrophic. Offering honest criticism is a deadly game and most advisers avoid doing so. Those who dare to gamble eventually lose and are purged. So over time, the advisers who remain are usually yes-men who act like bobbleheads, nodding along when the despot outlines some crackpot scheme.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>But to stay in power, despots have to worry about more than just their advisers and cronies. They have to win over, intimidate, or coerce their population too. That’s why dictators invest in state-sponsored media. In Russia, the state goes so far as to present fake presidential candidates who pretend to oppose Putin in rigged elections. The whole system is a Potemkin village, an illusion of choice and political debate.  
>  
>Again, that mechanism of control comes with a cost. Some citizens brainwashed by state propaganda will support a war that is sure to backfire. Others privately oppose the regime, but will be too afraid to say anything. As a result, reliable polling doesn’t exist in autocracies. (Russia is no exception.) That means that despots like Putin are unable to accurately understand the attitudes of their own people.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>Clearly, Putin is no fool. But as we debate possible endgames to the war in Ukraine, we shouldn’t kid ourselves. Putin, like many despots, isn’t behaving fully rationally. He inhabits a fantasy world, surrounded by people who are afraid to challenge him, with a mind that has been poisoned by more than two decades as a tyrant. He’s made a catastrophic mistake in Ukraine—one that may yet prove his downfall.  
>  
>Democracy isn’t perfect. It’s messy. It can be shortsighted. Many powerful democracies, including the United States, are dysfunctional. But at least our leaders face real constraints, real pushback for their miscalculations, and real criticism from their population. And, crucially, there’s a built-in mechanism to replace our leaders when they start to behave irrationally or irresponsibly.  
>  
>That’s why it’s time to jettison the myth of the “savvy” strongman, or the dictator who’s a geopolitical “genius.” Putin has fallen victim to the dictator trap and proved that he is neither.",1647525729.0,1647525687.0,t3_tg237c,t3_tg237c,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

Given that the reservists have been mobilized in Ukraine and many civilians have joined the flight. Taking Kyiv is an impossible task for Russia... short of completely turning it to rubble as they did to Aleppo.

They're kind of doing this already in Kherson and Muriopol because they're out of options.

Putin won't escape war crime outcomes if that happens (he's already in some deep poop on that front). This would mean that he spends the rest of his presidency - possibly through to 2036 if he illegitimately retains power over two more terms - in hiding and unable to engage with the international community.

Back in WW2, the US and allies thought (correctly) that Germany was attempting to build an atomic bomb, and were racing to develop one first. During the initial phases some scientists calculated that there was a chance an atomic bomb detonation could start a chain reaction of nitrogen molecules in the air, and ignite the atmosphere bathing the entire world in nuclear fire. Even with this information they proceeded to develop the weapons knowing that they could possibly kill every living thing on the planet.

Again this was when they THOUGHT that the opposing force was building an atom bomb, the difference now is that we KNOW they have them so I think it is less likely we will use them.",1647517333.0,1647517224.0,t3_tg237c,t3_tg237c,,0,6,0,6,0,0,

An assessment of Russian movements and successes in Ukraine indicates that Russian forces are advancing and may still achieve their goals. To survive the next few weeks, Ukrainian forces will need to adopt an operational plan based on exploiting their interior lines.

> 
> World War III is a decades-long Cold War concern. What we’re seeing now is something new—a spontaneous, crowd-funded world-wide effort to fight a war without springing the Armageddon tripwire.
> 
> Within three weeks, virtually all the world’s democratic nations and peoples have committed to repelling Russia’s invasion. The size, speed and depth of the response is almost incomprehensible.
> 
> The world’s behavior suggests, for the moment anyway, that we’ve decided that we’re all the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now, bound by a kind of global Article 5: A massive unprovoked attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.
> 
> Invocations of World War III by public figures as prominent as Messrs. Biden and Trump sound like excuses now to revert later to the passive pre-Ukraine status quo. The global support of “Ukraine”—a recognition that suddenly we are in World War 2½, with tough choices ahead—suggests people will be looking for much more than the Cold War status quo from their national leaders.

About three weeks ago, a deputy shows up at my door, asking if we’ve seen our neighbor across the street. We’ve lived in this bland suburban neighborhood since October, haven’t seen anyone coming or going in all that time. I thought it was an empty rental. Turns out, the deputy is there to do a welfare check. We tell him no, he goes on his way.

A couple of days later, doorbell rings. This time, it’s a hefty fella in a tight suit. He speaks with a heavy Slavic accent, possibly Russian, claiming to be the guy’s “lawyer”. He asks whether we told the deputy that we’d seen the neighbor. We explain that no, we didn’t, and haven’t seen anyone at that house at all. Lawyer says they’ve checked all the regional hospitals but he’s not in any of them. Lawyer gets into a black SUV that has two other people in it, drives slowly away.

A couple more days pass. This is a pretty quiet neighborhood, not a lot going on here. Outside smoking a cigarette, we see a black Chevy suburban with dark tinted windows pull into the missing neighbor’s driveway. It stays for a minute or so, then backs out and slooowly drives away, with the front seat passenger staring at the house.

Haven’t seen anyone there since and no more black SUVs. So my question is, Russian mafiya? Witness protection? A spy? My husband and I have been entertaining ourselves by trying to guess what’s going on. Anyone care to advance a theory?",False,1647521759.0,t3_tg237c,t3_tg237c,,0,-10,0,-10,0,0,

Two people from the military ship USS Forrest Sherman, who were visiting Stockholm during the week, have been arrested on suspicion of buying sex, according to information to Expressen .  
The arrest took place on Wednesday evening, according to the newspaper .  
The police do not want to confirm that the suspects are people from the ship, only that they are two foreign citizens who are suspected of buying sex. One of them is suspected of two cases of buying sex.  
\- Both have acknowledged. They were arrested at an apartment brothel on Östermalm. I have no more details to tell with regard to the investigation, says Anna Westberg, press spokesperson at the Stockholm Police.

Weapons are indeed necessary to fight, but to believe that sending weapons makes up for the true essence of war is rather short sighted.

War is, first and foremost, political. The thing stopping Russia at the moment is their (Ukraine's) intense and unifying will. As soon as Russia can galvanize that, their performance will get better. And since Eussia doctrine is generally about strategic objectives, the losses that they have suffered are not necessarily overwhelming considering that much of the fighting is urban. Russia may not have accomplished her goal with speed, but she will undoubtedly continue until either a political settlement is reached (neutrality, the Donbas, etc.) or the political will of Russia is undermined. I'm not sure what their public war opinion is, but should the rhetoric of Putin galvanize them, sanctions and western weapons will be insufficient,  despite the resultant logistical and economical challenges.

Edit: I want to say, because some comments seem to imy otherwise, that the existence of Ukraine is a political goal on both sides. Russia and Ukraine have specific political goals in mind regarding Ukraine. 

Secondly, I certainly hope the Russians fail to be galvanized. I'm not sure why I had to spell that out, but ppl think because of an observation regarding the nature of war, somehow I'm anti Ukrainian? I'm certainly not.",1647519778.0,1647517878.0,t3_tg237c,t3_tg237c,,0,-11,0,-11,0,0,

> Never isolate yourself when you come under pressure. This just cuts you off from information you need and people who could help you, and when real danger arises you won’t see it coming. Instead, make a point of being outgoing. Contact with others increases your power. Isolation is dangerous.

>It can be tempting to isolate yourself when you feel pressured or threatened. But this is a mistake. Isolation is dangerous.

>Most military commanders understand the risk of isolating yourself behind walls to ward off danger. First, doing so makes you an easy target — everyone knows where you are. Your enemies can lay siege and turn your fortress into a prison. You’re relying on limited information from an ever-smaller group of people. Also, you’re cut off from outside help and intelligence about what’s going on beyond your walls. Such isolation typically ends in defeat.

>According to Law 18 of the 48 Laws of Power, isolation is as bad a personal strategy as it is a military strategy. Maintaining power requires social interaction. You need to be the center of all activity and aware of everything and everyone revolving around you.

>When faced with threats, resist the urge to isolate yourself. Be more outgoing, connecting with old allies and creating new ones. You’ll be able to keep tabs on what’s going on and can respond effectively. The more you get around and interact in different circles of people, the more difficult it will be to keep secrets from you. And the more contact you have with others, the less likely you are to lose your sense of proportion and become obsessed.

NATO is strengthing the NATO perimeter, therefore you would see German Anti Aircraft Teams \[PATRIOT\] being sent.

Next up, Slovakia saying they want to send S-300 SAM Systems (This goes with US deal to procure S-300 w/ NATO for Ukraine) - S-300s are pretty low in stock, as they're old tech and old-soviet. Not very good, but okay. Modern is better. Slovakia (member of NATO) will send S-300 for NEW PROCUREMENT of AA.

Meaning, NATO/US would have to buy Slovakia new Anti-Aircraft (modern) systems. Probably not old german, as it would need to be translated etc.

So no, German Patriots wouldn't go to slovakia army, they'd have to buy new. Germany already amping up their spending, but Countries are pretty against giving equipment due to the cost and time of procurement.",1647530174.0,1647529932.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i10ynnh,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

A rapid Russian advance into the strategic southern town of 35,000 people, a gateway to a Ukrainian nuclear power station and pathway to attack Odessa from the back, would have showcased the Russian military’s abilities and severed Ukraine’s key communications lines.

Instead, the two-day battle of Voznesensk, details of which are only now emerging, turned decisively against the Russians. Judging from the destroyed and abandoned armor, Ukrainian forces, which comprised local volunteers and the professional military, eliminated most of a Russian battalion tactical group on March 2 and 3.

The Ukrainian defenders’ performance against a much-better-armed enemy in an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking region was successful in part because of widespread popular support for the Ukrainian cause—one reason the Russian invasion across the country has failed to achieve its principal goals so far. Ukraine on Wednesday said it was launching a counteroffensive on several fronts.

“Everyone is united against the common enemy,” said Voznesensk’s 32-year-old mayor, Yevheni Velichko, a former real-estate developer turned wartime commander, who, like other local officials, moves around with a gun. “We are defending our own land. We are at home.”",False,1647496523.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i0zit4b,,1,40,0,40,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

>Russian forces retreated more than 40 miles to the southeast, where other Ukrainian units have continued pounding them. Some dispersed in nearby forests, where local officials said 10 soldiers have been captured.

>Ukrainian officers estimated that some 100 Russian troops died in Voznesensk, including those whose bodies were taken by retreating Russian troops or burned inside carbonized vehicles.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine prompted leaders from the EU's 27 member countries to agree last week to phase out their reliance on Russian fossil fuels, including by ramping up liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports and speeding up deployment of renewable energy.

A total phase-out will take years, however, so countries are also planning measures to mitigate potential disruptions to supply from Russia, which provides 40% of the EU's gas, 27% of its oil imports and 46% of coal imports.

""Refilling of gas storage across the Union should start now. Member States and the Commission will urgently coordinate measures necessary to ensure adequate levels of gas storage before the next winter,"" said a draft of the conclusions for an EU leaders summit on March 24-25, seen by Reuters.

The European Commission will propose rules by next month requiring EU countries to collectively ensure gas stores are at least 90% full by Oct. 1 each year. The EU leaders' draft statement said they would ""take forward"" that proposal.

Interesting take.  I guess you're ignoring the [extremely high homicide, rape, and sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States#International_comparison) and [comparatively high poverty rate](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm#indicator-chart) when you make your claim that the US is the ""best""?

EDIT: as noted, the person I quoted did not specifically mention the United States.  I am using the US as an example of how capitalism is *not* inherently ""the best"" because the largest fucking economy on the planet is capitalist and has a ridiculously high level of violence and poverty, indicating to me - an adult with the ability to think objectively and critically - that perhaps ""western capitalism is the best and most peaceful social system that the world has ever seen"" is ridiculous.

Standing at 1,640 metres (5,381 ft) it is the highest mountain in the Southern Ural section, and is featured within the South Ural Nature Reserve. Yamantau is notable as the subject of claims by the United States that a secret extensive bunker complex of the Russian government or Russian Armed Forces is contained within the mountain, similar to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

It’s not really newsworthy outside of Germany, but the current sanctions already have an effect on our economy. From fishers staying in harbor, as fuel is too expensive, to industrial plants shutting down or reducing their output.

Don’t get me wrong - I’m ready to go into recession to help Ukraine and cripple Russia’s economy even further. 

But I can somewhat understand, why the government is scared to cripple our economy and putting too much of a burden on low-income households.

It’s especially complicated, as we have a three-party coalition for the first time.

What the government doesn’t like to say out loud: A lot of things in Germany don’t work as well as one might expect.

Germany, above all else, doesn't want another war in Europe and definitely doesn't want to be a part of the war, let alone to be the causing party. The liberal theory suggests that if you have strong and deep economic ties, countries won't go into war against each other. Germany - because of East Germany, I think - also had a ""feeling"" that they ""understood"" Russia, especially because of Merkel being in charge for a long time. 

But by doing that, they've angered their allies in East and Central Europe (there is a reason why many here don't think we would be helped by Germany in case of an invasion even if we are part of NATO/EU) and by willingly tying themselves to Russian gas, they've made themselves beholden to them. 

Economically everybody is feeling the pinch. Gas and electricity prices have been going through the roof this year everywhere in Europe AFAIK, so if they'd just go cold turkey on Russian gas, it would be a huge shock, incl businesses not being able to continue operating anymore. 

There's a lot more there, but I also think it's because of conditioning. Germany has been for a very long time the country that tried to keep their Russia-relations high up in the agenda, and it can be very difficult to undo the conditioning. If you're used to trying to engage with someone and giving them more and more chances, it may take a while before the behaviour changes. 

And also - I also suspect that Germany sees how the war is going, that it's going to take a while still, and they kind of fall back into their old patterns, which is ""can we find a way to de-escalate this with Russia?"". Sadly, for many in Eastern Europe, who are very very pissed off, this just signals again that Germany is willing to do business as usual with Russia, although it may not be so.",False,1647528796.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i10r8w9,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

*A twisted Russian politician has urged Vladimir Putin to fire ""a ballistic missile"" at the largest weapons testing site in the US as a warning.*

*Yevgeny Alexeyevich Fyodorov - a deputy of Russia's Duma - urged the despot to push the button and launch a missile at the Nevada test range as a warning because western leaders are assuming ""Putin has no trump cards in his hand.""*

*Another of the ""trump cards"" he proposed was the bombing of laboratories belonging to the US armed forces.*

*Fyodorov believes that if Russia did strike its Cold War foe, the US wouldn't retaliate, the Daily Star reports.*

*His comments are the most-recent in a long line of bizarre statements about US-Russia relations in recent years - including CIA assassination plots, rock music likened to ""US-instigated sabotage"" and a western-backed ""revolution"" that would lead to child sterilisation and famine.*

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia is sending ships full of supplies not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and either going around all of Africa, squeezing through the Horn of Africa, or going through the arctic to wave at Scandinavia menacingly. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. *Putin's destroy empire any %* speedrun continues at full speed.

It's a big deal with no short-term solutions so sanctions, etc would cause grander issues than what we currently see. China owns so much of our collective asses that so much business and politics goes into pleasing the Chinese. It's sickening. Think about the fact that it's cheaper to outsource manufacturing and labor across the globe than to have the manufacturing at home. It's so much cheaper that US (and other nations') companies are willing to turn a blind eye to the atrocities they commit in favor of profits. 

Russia has oil but only accounts for 10% of the global exports so cutting them off isn't a huge risk.

Also, and I'm not saying I condone this, but genociding the people *of a completely separate sovereign nation* is I guess geopolitically somewhat worse than the people in your own country. I mean, why hasn't anyone stepped in North Korea for starving their own people? Also, a measurable amount of ""why"" likely revolves around ethnically white people being oppressed as opposed to non-whites.

You should know that Russia follows a war doctrine called new generation warfare. The main idea of NGW is to use informational warfare to morally and psychologically demoralize the enemy. It’s a viscous cycle. Military attacks worsen enemy morale, and low enemy morale makes military attacks more effective. 

Hence, sentiments sympathetic to Russian soldiers actually aid Russian forces and harm Ukrainian forces. One of Russia’s favorite strategies is to take advantage of peoples unwillingness to dehumanize others to restrain anti-Russian sentiments in foreign countries. The more sympathetic the public, the less pressure they’ll put on their governments to intervene. It’s why they bother having Russian bots on social media.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

Russian survivors of the Voznesensk battle left behind nearly 30 of their 43 vehicles—tanks, armored personnel carriers, multiple-rocket launchers, trucks—as well as a downed Mi-24 attack helicopter, according to Ukrainian officials in the city. The helicopter’s remnants and some pieces of burned-out Russian armor were still scattered around Voznesensk on Tuesday.

Russian forces retreated more than 40 miles to the southeast, where other Ukrainian units have continued pounding them. Some dispersed in nearby forests, where local officials said 10 soldiers have been captured.

“We didn’t have a single tank against them, just rocket-propelled grenades, Javelin missiles and the help of artillery,” said Vadym Dombrovsky, commander of the Ukrainian special-forces reconnaissance group in the area and a Voznesensk resident. “The Russians didn’t expect us to be so strong. It was a surprise for them. If they had taken Voznesensk, they would have cut off the whole south of Ukraine.”

Ukrainian officers estimated that some 100 Russian troops died in Voznesensk, including those whose bodies were taken by retreating Russian troops or burned inside carbonized vehicles. As of Tuesday, 11 dead Russian soldiers were in the railway car turned morgue, with search parties looking for other bodies in nearby forests.

 >An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles (missile defense). Ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological, or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term ""anti-ballistic missile"" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat; however, it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

,tg237c,i10nhmv,"During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the invasion of Cuba was OPLAN 316 [Operational Plan]. NATO had a First Strike Policy in place, the nuclear war plans had zero flexibility.

The moment the US invasion fleet is destroyed, Strategic Air Command would have executed SIOP-63 [Single Integrated Operational Plan]. 2,952 strategic nuclear weapons would have been used against the Communist Block within 8 hours.

The US had 224 ICBMs on alert: 142 C/HGM-16D/E/F Atlas D/E/F, 62 HGM-25A Titan I, and 20 LGM-30A Minuteman IA. The first wave consisted of 49 ICBM launches followed within two hours by the rest. This would effectively take out a substantial chunk of the Soviet Air Defences and allow the bombers to penetrate.

The bomber force consisted of 540 B-52D/E/F/G/Hs Stratofortresses, 790 B-47B/Es Stratojets, and 72 B-58As Hustlers. They were equipped with the AGM-28A Hound Dog [on some B-52s] and with mainly Mk-15 and B28 series free-fall bombs. The Hound Dogs had a yield of 1.1 or 1.45 Mt, depending on the type of warhead. The free-fall bombs had yields between 350 kt and 1.69 Mt. Some B-58A Hustlers would carry the Mk-39 series with a yield of 3 or 4 Mt against command bunkers. They would dash in and take out the bunkers around Moscow.

The US Navy would fly 62 aircraft against the Soviet Union. All A-4B/C/E Skyhawks carrying B28 series free-fall bombs. The Navy had two Washington-Class SSBNs on patrol with 16 UGM-27A Polaris SLBMs with a 600 kt warhead; and two Grayback-class each carrying 4 RGM-15A Regulus II cruise missiles each carrying a W-27 Mod.1 warhead at 2 Mt all aimed at the Soviet Union.

Cuba would have been hit by 14 tactical nuclear weapons, all B28s, while North Korea would have been hit by 35, and China by 60. The Nuclear Operations Plan of NATO had allocated a further 3,011 nuclear weapons against Eastern Europe varying from battlefield rockets, over cruise missiles and free-fall bombs, to strategic weapons carried by the British V-Bomber Force. These attacks would have been executed within the first 5 hours of the war.

Follow up nuclear attacks were planned with an undefined number of nuclear weapons, depending on how well the war was going. The British had 175 nuclear weapons, the US 27,387.

The first wave would kill an estimated 37% of the Soviet population. The ultimate aim was to destroy 75% of the Soviet military, 90% of the industry, 75% of all housing, and to kill 55% of the entire Soviet population within 72 hours.

The Soviets had 3,322 nuclear weapons of which only 149 were on alert. Most of these weapons would have been destroyed in the NATO Nuclear First Strike.

It is doubtful the Soviets would have been able to hit even a couple of targets within NATO and other Western countries.",False,1647524877.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i10ndk2,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

 >In representative democracies, Gerrymandering (, originally ) refers to political manipulation of electoral district boundaries with the intent of creating undue advantage for a party, group, or socio-economic class within the constituency. Two principal tactics are used in gerrymandering: ""cracking"" (i. e. diluting the voting power of the opposing party's supporters across many districts) and ""packing"" (concentrating the opposing party's voting power in one district to reduce their voting power in other districts).

A Ukrainian military explosives specialist accompanied him, because some bodies had been booby trapped.

About 10 Ukrainian civilians died in Voznesensk during the combat and two more after hitting a land mine afterward, local officials said. Ukraine doesn’t disclose its military losses. There were fatalities, mostly among the Territorial Defense volunteer forces, local residents said.

The Russian operation to seize Voznesensk, 20 miles from the South Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plant, was ambitious and well-equipped. It began after Russian forces fanned out of the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow severed from Ukraine and annexed in 2014, and thrust northward to seize the regional capital of Kherson on March 1. They pushed to the edge of Mykolaiv, the last major city before Odessa, Ukraine’s main port.

About 55 miles north of Mykolaiv, Voznesensk offered an alternative bridge over the Southern Bug river and access to the main highway linking Odessa with the rest of Ukraine. Russian forces raced toward the town at the same time as they made a successful push northeast to seize the city of Enerhodar, where another major Ukrainian nuclear power plant is located.

Your ""hasn't been disproven"" statement is an article of faith, rather than an article of fact as you've shifted the burden of proof to people who disagree with you, rather than proving it yourself.  The Chinese suppression of doctors who sounded the alarm, can be easily explained by the same rationale DJT used to downplay the pandemic--rather than by a devious intent to upset American economic power.

The 1918 Spanish Flu shows that you don't need national actors acting in an intentionally bad manner to have a global pandemic.  We call it the Spanish flu for propaganda reasons.

The economic anxiety has roots in the 1990s where the Clinton administration gave China favorable trade status, and American industry began to move overseas.  It reflects earlier racist sentiment that occurred when Japanese automakers seriously encroached on Detroit's profits.  Why do you think the Republicans were screaming about  ""C...C...Clinton?""  It's because they knew anti-Clinton sentiment had fertile ground in their supporters' minds.

As for the Uighur, that's indefensible--and simply the product of Unity Politics.  Unity politics isn't something that is unique to China.

OP said the above. If Russian military is exhausted, gets beaten back to borders, and Russia has essentially lost the war, Putin's time in power would likely be limited for the humiliating defeat. While the Russian people generally agreed with independence of Donbass and Luhansk, I'd wonder if all Ukrainian action wouldn't extremely sour Russian taste buds for further dispute especially with what is happening in Russia now. Ukraine seems to be badly beating Russia in propaganda war. 

If the war stagnates and people continue dying, but neither side really has an upper hand, then sure Ukraine just wants Russia off their currently undisputed lands. I thought I may have read they want them out of Donbass/Luhansk as well, but that may not be the case. My understanding is they'd be neutral in regards to NATO, continue towards EU move, be allowed to have an army with current negotiations.

He got other businessmen who owned a quarry and a construction company to block off most streets to channel the Russian column into areas that would be easier to hit with artillery.

Ahead of the Russian advance, military engineers blew up the bridge over the Mertvovod and a railroad bridge on the town’s edge. Waiting for the Russians in and around Voznesensk were Ukrainian regular army troops and members of the Territorial Defense force, which Ukraine established in January, recruiting and arming volunteers to help protect local communities. Local witnesses, officials and Ukrainian combat participants recounted what happened next.

Missile strikes
The Russian assault began with missile strikes and shelling that hit central Voznesensk, destroying the municipal swimming pool and damaging high-rises. Helicopters dropped Russian air-assault troops in a forested ridge southwest of Voznesensk, as an armored column drove from the southeast. Mr. Velichko said a local collaborator with the Russians, a woman driving a Hyundai SUV, showed the Russian column a way through back roads.

Ukrainian officers estimate that some 400 Russian troops took part in the attack. The number would have been bigger if these forces—mostly from the 126th naval infantry brigade based in Perevalnoye, Crimea, according to seized documents—hadn’t come under heavy shelling along the way.

Natalia Horchuk, a 25-year-old mother of three, said Russian soldiers appeared in her garden in the village of Rakove in the Voznesensk municipality early March 2. They told her and neighbors to leave for their safety, and parked four tanks and infantry fighting vehicles between the houses. “Do you have anywhere to go?” she recalled them asking. “This place will be hit.”

“We can hide in the cellar,” she replied.

Yes, the Russians have developed a relatively new class of SSBN, the Borei class, but that program has been delayed repeatedly and only three boats are currently operational. While the Russian Navy has ten other SSBNs, all those boats were built in the Soviet era and they struggle with maintenance issues. They are also loud.

That matters in better enabling U.S. intelligence services to monitor the location of Russia's SSBN force at all times. In war, this would enable U.S. Virginia class attack submarines to hunt and kill the Russian fleet before they reached their launch patrol sectors. In a crisis, the U.S. would surge its attack submarines to ensure redundant capability.

Moreover, the U.S. Navy is considering placing nuclear-armed missiles on some of its Virginia class attack submarines and is actively developing a next generation SSBN boat, the Columbia class.

,tg237c,i10nd6g,"During the Cuban Missile Crisis, the invasion of Cuba was OPLAN 316 [Operational Plan]. NATO had a First Strike Policy in place, the nuclear war plans had zero flexibility.

The moment the US invasion fleet is destroyed, Strategic Air Command would have executed SIOP-63 [Single Integrated Operational Plan]. 2,952 strategic nuclear weapons would have been used against the Communist Block within 8 hours.

The US had 224 ICBMs on alert: 142 C/HGM-16D/E/F Atlas D/E/F, 62 HGM-25A Titan I, and 20 LGM-30A Minuteman IA. The first wave consisted of 49 ICBM launches followed within two hours by the rest. This would effectively take out a substantial chunk of the Soviet Air Defences and allow the bombers to penetrate.

The bomber force consisted of 540 B-52D/E/F/G/Hs Stratofortresses, 790 B-47B/Es Stratojets, and 72 B-58As Hustlers. They were equipped with the AGM-28A Hound Dog [on some B-52s] and with mainly Mk-15 and B28 series free-fall bombs. The Hound Dogs had a yield of 1.1 or 1.45 Mt, depending on the type of warhead. The free-fall bombs had yields between 350 kt and 1.69 Mt. Some B-58A Hustlers would carry the Mk-39 series with a yield of 3 or 4 Mt against command bunkers. They would dash in and take out the bunkers around Moscow.

The US Navy would fly 62 aircraft against the Soviet Union. All A-4B/C/E Skyhawks carrying B28 series free-fall bombs. The Navy had two Washington-Class SSBNs on patrol with 16 UGM-27A Polaris SLBMs with a 600 kt warhead; and two Grayback-class each carrying 4 RGM-15A Regulus II cruise missiles each carrying a W-27 Mod.1 warhead at 2 Mt all aimed at the Soviet Union.

Cuba would have been hit by 14 tactical nuclear weapons, all B28s, while North Korea would have been hit by 35, and China by 60. The Nuclear Operations Plan of NATO had allocated a further 3,011 nuclear weapons against Eastern Europe varying from battlefield rockets, over cruise missiles and free-fall bombs, to strategic weapons carried by the British V-Bomber Force. These attacks would have been executed within the first 5 hours of the war.

Follow up nuclear attacks were planned with an undefined number of nuclear weapons, depending on how well the war was going. The British had 175 nuclear weapons, the US 27,387.

The first wave would kill an estimated 37% of the Soviet population. The ultimate aim was to destroy 75% of the Soviet military, 90% of the industry, 75% of all housing, and to kill 55% of the entire Soviet population within 72 hours.

The Soviets had 3,322 nuclear weapons of which only 149 were on alert. Most of these weapons would have been destroyed in the NATO Nuclear First Strike.

1. India literally cannot alienate russia because most of India's military equipment comes from russia. If russia cuts them off from spare parts their military would be toast.

India feels threatened by China.
2. Because of China India desperately needs more allies, it's best possible option for allies to oppose china in the world is the west. The west and India are technically a good fit due to them both being democracies.

So, India cannot afford to piss off russia, and India cannot afford to piss off the west.

Loud Hindu nationalists in India will be pro-russia because they remember the USSR when russia was a great ally to India and are suspicous or resentful of the west.

But loud Hindu nationalists aren't the entirety of india, it is a very diverse country.

As darkness fell March 2, Mr. Rudenko, who owns a company transporting gravel and sand, took cover in a grove on the wheat field’s edge under pouring rain. The Russian tanks there would fire into Voznesensk and immediately drive a few hundred yards away to escape return fire, he said.

Mr. Rudenko was on the phone with a Ukrainian artillery unit. Sending coordinates via the Viber social-messaging app, he directed artillery fire at the Russians. So did other local Territorial Defense volunteers around the city. “Everyone helped,” he said. “Everyone shared the information.”

Ukrainian shelling blew craters in the field, and some Russian vehicles sustained direct hits. Other Ukrainian regular troops and Territorial Defense forces moved toward Russian positions on foot, hitting vehicles with U.S.-supplied Javelin missiles. As Russian armor caught fire—including three of the five tanks in the wheat field—soldiers abandoned functioning vehicles and escaped on foot or sped off in the BTRs that still had fuel. They left crates of ammunition.

Mr. Rudenko picked up a Russian conscript days later, he said, who served as an assistant artillery specialist at a Grad multiple-rocket launcher that attacked Voznesensk from a forest. The 18-year-old conscript, originally from eastern Ukraine and a Crimea resident since 2014, suffered a concussion after a Ukrainian shell hit near him. He woke the next morning, left his weapon and wandered into a village, Mr. Rudenko said. There, a woman took him into her home and called the village head, who informed Territorial Defense. “He’s still in shock about what happened to him,” Mr. Rudenko said.

Mr. Dombrovsky, the reconnaissance-unit commander, said he captured several soldiers in their early 20s and a 31-year-old senior lieutenant from the Russian military intelligence. The lieutenant, he said, had forced a private to swap uniforms but was discovered because of the age discrepancy—and because Ukrainian forces found Russian personnel files in the column’s command vehicle.

“The Russians had orders to come in, seize, and await further instructions,” Mr. Dombrovsky said. “But they had no orders for what to do if they are defeated. That, they didn’t plan for.”",False,1647496628.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i0zj4lh,,6,6,0,6,0,0,

The only explosions are from bomb squads occasionally disposing ordnance. Mr. Velichko, the mayor, fielded citizen phone calls Tuesday, telling one he would take care of a possibly rabid dog and assuring another that her utilities wouldn’t be cut in wartime even if she was late in paying. He argued with an army commander because Ukrainian soldiers had siphoned fuel from the gas station.

Spartak Hukasian, head of the Voznesensk district council, said the city—no longer near front lines—was starting to get used to relatively peaceful life again. “He who laughs last laughs best,” he said. “We haven’t had a chance to laugh until now.”

The United States has refused to adopt a no first use policy and says that it ""reserves the right to use"" nuclear weapons first in the case of conflict. The US doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons was revised most recently in the Nuclear Posture Review, released April 6, 2010.\[34\] The 2010 Nuclear Posture review reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons: ""The fundamental role of U.S. nuclear weapons, which will continue as long as nuclear weapons exist, is to deter nuclear attack on the United States, our allies, and partners."" The U.S. doctrine also includes the following assurance to other states: ""The United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.""\[34\]  
  
For states eligible for the assurance, the United States would not use nuclear weapons in response to a chemical or biological attack but states that those responsible for such an attack would be held accountable and would face the prospect of a devastating conventional military response. Even for states that are not eligible for the assurance, the United States would consider the use of nuclear weapons only in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners. The Nuclear Posture Review also notes, ""It is in the U.S. interest and that of all other nations that the nearly 65-year record of nuclear non-use be extended forever.""\[34\]  
  
This supersedes the doctrine of the George W. Bush administration set forth in ""Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations"" and written under the direction of Air Force General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The new doctrine envisions commanders requesting presidential approval to use nuclear weapons to preempt an attack by a nation or a terrorist group using weapons of mass destruction.\[35\] The draft also includes the option of using nuclear weapons to destroy known enemy stockpiles of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.  
  
In August 2016, President Barack Obama reportedly considered adopting a 'No First Use' policy.\[36\]\[37\]\[38\] Obama was persuaded by several Cabinet officials that 'No First Use' would rattle U.S. allies and decided not to take up the policy.\[39\]\[40\]  
  
In 2017, there were efforts to either require congressional approval for a pre-emptive nuclear strike\[41\] or to ban it altogether and impose an NFU policy.\[42\]",False,1647533494.0,t3_tg237c,t1_i11873d,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
