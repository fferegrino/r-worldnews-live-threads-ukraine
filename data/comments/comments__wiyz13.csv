Day 166 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today the morning started with a shelling of residential districts. In Pavlove Pole district 1 civilian died just outside of his home, with no military targets anywhere near. They used cluster munitions fired from MLRS yet again, and the only reason there weren’t more casualties is because many of the bomblets malfunctioned, and didn’t explode as they were supposed to, over 22 of them failed to explode.

As always there was a missile strike, at a new time again, at 2:10am this time. We don’t know how many missiles were fired exactly, but it was most likely 4, which is the full load of one S-300 launcher, and there were 4 explosions, 2 in the city, and 2 in Kharkiv oblast. The ones in the city sounded extremely loud here, the missiles most likely landed within couple of kilometers from me.

One of the missiles sounded pretty weird, the sound of its explosion lasted for something like 5 seconds straight. And what is even weirder  is that for some reason there was no info about it at all after it happened, despite being so incredibly loud and the sound lasting for a long time, it didn’t cause a fire, and there was no smoke either. We will know what was hit later in the day, but right now we don’t even know which district the missiles landed in.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 8 August 2022
 
- Russia is highly likely deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in the Donbas. These mines have the potential to inflict widespread casualties amongst both the military and the local civilian population.

- In Donetsk and Kramatorsk, Russia has highly likely attempted employment of PFM-1 and PFM-1S scatterable anti-personnel mines. Commonly called the butterfly mine, the PFM-1 series are deeply controversial, indiscriminate weapons.

- PFM-1s were used to devastating effect in the Soviet-Afghan War where they allegedly maimed high numbers of children who mistook them for toys. It is highly likely that the Soviet-era stock being used by Russia will have degraded over time and are now highly unreliable and unpredictable. This poses a threat to both the local population and humanitarian mine clearance operations.

# Quotes


**Equipment shortcomings**:

- The Armed Forces of Russia have practically no fifth-generation combat aircraft. 

- We do not have enough high-precision weapons and modern aiming equipment. 

- Combat vehicles of the next Armata family still cannot enter service.
- . . . the experience of military operations in Ukraine has shown that a tank without a KAZ is now not at all capable of surviving on the battlefield.

- . . . we do not have enough precision-guided munitions and accurate means of detection and target designation in aviation


**Russian Manpower**
 

- We are very much short of infantry. [ . . . ] We have to break the frontline with an insufficient number of soldiers using vulnerable tanks and infantry fighting vehicles [BMP]. Currently in the Donbass, the Russian side is trying to solve this by using a large amount of artillery, but, as you can see, things are going very slowly.

- . . . we simply do not have enough troops to effectively advance in one more direction.




**On Ukraine**


- their gunners are more experienced. 

-  *Drones:* [UA] learned how to use their old Soviet guns in conjunction with commercial drones. As a result, they have better, as they say now, “situational awareness”, and they have better target designation. Simply put, in the case of an artillery duel, they often beat us. In general, the use of small drones has revolutionised the use of artillery. We actually missed this revolution and now we have to catch up “on the go.”


- *Himars*:  . . . thousands of unguided projectiles... is powerless... [due to their] two guided missiles that accurately hit the target. 


**Comparisons**:

- . . . airborne troops are roughly speaking a poor substitute-infantry. Their aluminum BMD [infantry fighting vehicles] are generally easily hit, and they have fewer other weapons than the motorised riflemen.

- . . . during an artillery duel the Ukrainian systems will be able to destroy our batteries, and the Russian return fire simply will not reach the target.
 
- *regarding theory that UA doesn’t counterattack because don’t have weapons stockpiled yet*:  . . . those units that fight on the front lines are well supplied. They have a Reserve Corps and if needed the Armed Forces of Ukraine can counterattack. [. . . ] In fact, the underestimation of the enemy played a cruel joke on us.
 
  So far, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have not demonstrated the ability to launch effective offensives above the tactical level, such as recapturing a village. In essence, in an offensive, they have the same tactical problems as the Russian side—the attacking forces are usually few in number, they come under fire from artillery (which usually cannot be suppressed) and quickly roll back or are unable to hold the newly occupied positions, armoured vehicles are struck massively.",1659992132.0,1659987127.0,t3_wiyz13,t3_wiyz13,,0,58,0,58,0,0,

Russian officials say those votes would legitimize Russia’s claim to those areas, but critics say the votes would be a Russian-manipulated farce.
>
>Secretary of State Antony Blinken and senior White House officials have warned that any attempted land grab through “sham” referendums would bring “additional costs imposed upon Russia.”
>
>One challenge for Ukrainian officials pushing for strong measures to prevent a referendum is explaining why it would mark a turning point in the war. The vast majority of the international community wouldn’t recognize such a vote or Russia’s subsequent annexation. But analysts say that once Russians have officially laid claim to territory and declared it part of Russia, it would erase any possibility of Russian troops withdrawing without being forced out militarily.
>
>Annexation would also complicate matters for Western countries that have been providing Ukraine with weapons. Officials in Washington and European capitals have carefully sought to limit the weapons they provide for strikes on Russian forces inside Ukraine. But if Moscow considered strikes in post-referendum Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as the targeting of Russian territory, it could risk dragging NATO countries into the conflict.
>
>Zelensky has said that annexing territory would rule out negotiations with Russia.

- Joe Biden is a war criminal 
- NATO was responsible for the War of Russian Aggression 
- America is responsible for continuing the war 
- America should have no voice in the War because of it's invasion of Iraq. 
- America should push Ukraine to the bargaining table, not help them defend Ukraine.

- Taiwan doesn't exist, other then being a part of China that America is unlawfully keeping independent.

Ah yes, the big unprovoked invasion that would lead to so much death and destruction and if it weren't for Ukraine fighting back it wouldn't have turned into a dirty back alley brawl! I shouldn't complain because he was pretty honest and critical through the rest of the interview which is rare from the Russian side but hard not to react to this. But we knew of the ""kill lists"" since the start but maybe they don't consider pro-Ukrainians as local residents?

I do believe they did fuck up the early stages but it wasn't because of aspirations towards some knightly duel but rather that the FSB had fed them inaccurate information of Ukrainian resistance so most BTG's just got orders as if there wouldn't be much fighting happening and Ukraine would just be scared into surrendering (this was something that was [happening a lot during the Soviet times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia) with tanks rolling in)",False,1659990600.0,t3_wiyz13,t1_ijhczt5,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

It has to take you out of the fight some.  That's what casualty means: your availability for duty is lost.

By 30% casualties most US combat groups are considered ""combat ineffective"" and would only carry on the mission if they knew 100% the objective was at hand or if it was a mission to save the world lol 

In reality at 20% casualties most units aren't very effective, especially in a short window during an active battle.  Every 1 wounded is treated and carried to evac by 1 or sometimes 2 soldiers.  So by the time 1 out of 10 is wounded, it actually takes 2 or 3 out of 10 out of the battle. Again, only in the most critical of battles, ones not really fought since WW2 for the US, would there be any order to ignore the wounded.  

A soldier is a valuable asset that takes months to train and these days hundreds of thousands of dollars to train and equip, so even if your not considering the human aspect of losing someone that could've been saved, it's vital to save lives and get soldiers back to fighting.  

If we're talking about actually stopping all advances and retreating because it's a lost cause, it's usually an ""in the moment"" decision taking several factors into account, but mainly asking ""At this rate of casualties is the objective worth continuing onto and is it still possible to obtain?""  Let's say halfway to your objective you've lost 15% of your soldiers, you can assume that by the end of the battle you'll lose another 15-20% so you're risking 1/3 of your forces and for what?  To capture the enemy capital and end the war? Maybe worth it... But just to capture a compound that may have someone important in it but you don't know for sure?  Then you'd probably have already pulled back before casualties piled up to 15%.

Edit: also as a leader making these decisions you have to ask yourself how would the remaining troops view the sacrifice of losing at least 1 or 2 close friends and brothers in arms?  How would this affect morale?  In wars like US vs Iraq, would the public sentiment turn against the war if I lose 5,000 troops trying to take a city?  

In the case of Russia vs Ukraine, Ukraine doesn't have much choice, most of their soldiers know that any surrender would mean death anyways so they'll fight to the last man.  Russia has already hit about 30% KIA and probably close to 50-60% casualties of the initial 150,000 they sent into Ukraine, factoring in an unknown exact number of replacements, they have been struggling for months hence why they did not win the war and are actually fighting in defense now.  They have shown they don't care about their soldiers lives and so throw them into death traps and losses are just staggering.

I don't think it's crazy to think that Russia might blow up a nuclear power plant when they are currently lobbing explosives at a nuclear power plant.

The forces a nuclear bomb has to create just to achieve fusion are so extreme I don't think the material in the fuel rods would change state in such a way to ""juice"" the explosion sort to speak. The heat and pressure wouldn't be at the levels required for fusion and the material a power plant uses is not the same as that in a bomb. It would most likely result in significantly more radioactive contamination than just the bomb alone would leave as you would have the radioactive material of all the fuel rods in the 6 reactors and any other stored on site, that's a massive amount of material compared to what's in a bomb.

However the reactor cores in a nuclear plant tend to be encased in layers of concrete and in large buildings, although a nuclear weapon would no doubt devastate these buildings it's impossible to know to what extent the material would be taken up in the air by the explosion and therefore how widely it would disperse itself. So you could get it spread out over a huge area that would be less contaminated or you might have a smaller area that is insanely contaminated.

Either way you wouldn't get a bigger bang but with all the reactors heavily damaged or destroyed the resulting nuclear contamination would be so, so much worse than just the bomb going off alone.

That opens up a stream of chain reacting neutrons which burn off even more of the xenon.

Those first two examples and the [Zapatistas](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/feb/17/mexico-zapatistas-rebels-24-years-mountain-strongholds) all have a military component capable of fighting aggression from another state.   


Would any be as capable of resisting Russian aggression? Would an anarchist Ukraine receive the same international support from big democratic capitalist powers? IDK.  


In an ideal future where anarchism is popular and widespread enough to successfully work with 40 million people in an area the size of Ukraine, I would imagine millions of people around the work coming to Ukraine to fight, or sending money and supplies, and/or resisting the aggression from within Russia. Especially if radical unions and the workers of the world had more control over the means of production. Or if there were more anarchist projects able to organize to support their peers instead of fighting for their own survival.   


Anarchism or anarchist ideas in most places represents a very small minority of people and so I'm not often theorizing that there would be an anarchist ""state"" or majority, since we feel so far away from that point. So my actions now are grounded in a work ethic, actions where I can influence anything for the greater good, and the whole ""building the new world in the shell of the old"" revolutionary type things when it's possible.   


I liked [this interview](https://thefinalstrawradio.noblogs.org/post/2022/02/25/anarchists-in-ukraine-against-war/) with anarchists in the early days of the war, where they say they have to collaborate with the state as an act of survival and are trying to have input and influence where they can while maintaining their autonomy where they can.   


The more we move the entire world away from hierarchy, class, authoritarianism and toward harmony, prosperity, and freedom- the closer we get to allowing anarchism to spread as an ideology. Yes, we don't need a perfect world for anarchism to grow.

The major Mujhadeen groups were fighting a Civil War amongst themselves and the Pakistani ISI created and supported the Taliban so that an ally would win that Afghan Civil War.

Al Qaeda was formed from the merger of a single Mujhadeen cell led by Osama bin Laden, which was more or less too small to be directly supported by the CIA, and Al-Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization.

Who the US directly funded that REALLY came back to bite was Haqqani.  The Haqqanis were a family at the head of a Pashtun tribe in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  The Haqqanis would go on to support both the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  The original patriarch of the Haqqani family would end up getting hit by a drone strike in the 2010s.  A Haqqani would join the Taliban government as foreign minister.  And Al-Zawahiri was killed while living in a house owned by the Haqqanis in Kabul.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Friedman

I'm not discrediting his journalist skills. There's a lot of people who have some very strong biases but are very competent when they're writing about things that don't involve those biases. An example would be some left-leaning writer who's very good at writing critique of US foreign policy but then somehow loses all that critical edge when they write about China or Russia.

Friedman's Pulitzers:

> Friedman has won the Pulitzer Prize three times:

> 1983: for his coverage of the war in Lebanon. A distinguished example of international reporting[106]

> 1988: for coverage of Israel: a distinguished example of reporting on international affairs[107]

> 2002: for his commentary illuminating the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat[108]

Two of those are from 40 years ago and the third one from 20 years ago.

Anyway, it's hard to comment much on the article of his that you posted. It makes a bunch of claims but doesn't provide sources. This doesn't mean it's necessarily BS, it might have some truth to it. But it's still just one piece of text and there's a lot of those around by different writers.

In my view it fits with the recent happenings of the war. The Donetsk front was a constant for the past 8 years and hasn't really moved in the past 5 months of the war, as it was neglected by the Russians. Now in the past week or two they started to increase fighting and are in active battle for territory once again. Additionally the Ukrainian counter offesive in the south isn't working and western support isn't trending towards and increase. I just think Ukraine is resorting to more desperate measures and petal mines are one of those means they always have, I don't see why they wouldn't give them a go in the current offensive that moves through the city of Donetsk.

I agree that we''ll likely not get conclusive answers to many of the situations in Ukraine, but hopefully there will be enough to get some sort of realistic view. To me it is entirely understandable that Ukraine would use what they can including petal mines and also including civilian infrastructure in their military strategy. I don't blame them, it's just that they also take blame when a child picks up one of those plastic things and gets an arm blown off, the same that Russia takes blame when it broadly shells a whole quarter of houses just because they spotted a military vehicle.

So although it might give the US military more leverage to increase resources for China at least in the short term Russia's invasion of Ukraine probably lessens US ability to pivot China.

> What would be the reason for Russia attacking Ukraine?

Ukraine has been financed and militarized by the west for the past decade. This is publicly known and accepted in western media btw, not some sort of anti-west propaganda. That's just what was happening there. The goal of this money was 'government building' or 'democratization' etc. Russia obviously sees this and is unhappy for several reasons. It is unhappy the US meddles in it's neighborhood, it is unhappy about potential NATO presence in Ukraine and it is also unhappy from a historic and cultural point of view, because Ukraine is special to Russia and Russian speakers, it is not comparable to countries like Finnland in the minds of the Russian people. The language, which around half of Ukrainians spoke exclusively Russian in their day to day lives, the culture and history connect them. There were several attempts, threats and power plays to show that Russia is unwilling to let Ukraine's government get into bed with the US and to some extend the EU.

So at some point their assesment was that these other means are not working, so they resorted to the military options that we see now. It's a linear devlopement of escalation, which has been happening for years. Nobody who really knows about this situation is in any way surprised.

> What would be the reason for Russia attacking civilian targets with cruise missiles?

Too many individual factors to say, but a lot of the time there is use of weapons from the buildings, they see movement of military vehicles in or around them, they get intelligence from neighbors about weapon deliveries etc. and of course as the last reason, incompetence. I'm sure there have been wrongly targeted strikes, as we see with any country doing these operations, but the main objectives are pretty obvious.

> What would be the reason that looting, raping and murder in the Russian army is technically legal?

Are you really asking why murder or looting is legal for soldiers in a war? I guess for rapes and such the story is different. Sometimes the soldiers are just assholes who protect their collegues, like we see in civilian life with police. Other times the evidence is just hearsay from people so the military can't act. And of course there are people being put to jail for the most disgusting crimes where sufficient evidence is present.

Bravo for Zelensky. This is very impressive and I hope he continues making reforms to bring Ukraine in line with EU standards. 

HAVING SAID THAT, Zelensky is only one person. This isn't a one man show. While Zelensky is doing the best he can, as we can plainly see from him sacking his HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE, the same CANNOT be said for all the people in his administration. 


> I sincerely the US. has reservations about the Ukrainian government, mostly because most of Zelensky’s decisions are made off US advice.

US Advice: Make sure you vet your commanders properly

Zelensky: You got it hoss

And what happened? Commander of Kerson turned traitor. This was a failure of intelligence of Ukraine. 

As you can see, just because you have the US advising Ukraine, doesn't mean mistakes aren't going to happen. 



> but allies can rely on another country’s support and depend on it intelligence without becoming a puppet.

Yes I agree. Bravo. Doesn't change anything I said. 


> however the US will support and respect Zelensky and his generals’ decisions.

Yes. That is true. I don't think the US supported that General handing over Kherson to Russia though. 


> This kind of relationship does not exist or make sense to Russians.

No it does not. I agree.

Ukraine has been influenced by Russia for decades.

Zelensky is making the correct moves with the help of the USA.

Getting rid of this kind of Russian colluding crap out of Ukraine is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

The things you are talking about are not a reason for the US to not work with Ukraine. In fact, they are proof that Zelensky’s administration is the real deal.

This is exactly what a functioning administration looks like.

When it comes to a “one man show” that is exactly what a leader is. He is one man right now who currently has the power to clean the Russian colluding mess up, and he is currently doing exactly that.

Other examples of a “one man show” is Biden winding back Trumps poor policy decisions.

Probably the biggest example of a one man show is Putin - who has single handedly squandered Russias hopes of becoming a functioning world power by turning Russians into poverty stricken slaves and hoarding all the wealth for himself and his friends.
