These has been made available publicly.Here is my translation of what he says, which I think is quite interesting to learn. I can tell for sure he has Caucasian(from Caucasus) accent and this is rather authentic than staged.Video from Telegram:

Message 1:""Lads, hello all. I am here with Rusik, Carev, Max Belov and youngsters. What can I say. Everything going is fking crazy, lads. 3 squads BTGRs were sent to Ukraine. 1st BTGR was completely fked. 2nd BTGR is holding up but no idea what state they are in. 3 BTGR: Zampolit(low ranking commander) left with 4-5 Motalygas and a few Urals(vehicles). No idea what state they are in. ""

Message 2:""Then, yesterday night 60 guys on Urals and Kamazes arrived from BTGR 1. They are saying only them left from the whole BTGR. Combat(some sort of commander) of the first battalion of infantry has been captured. In our brigade there are lots of 200s(dead). The Vahta(transport) that we used to get from Kursk to Belgorod says he was ferrying 200s the whole day yesterday. The driver is fking shocked. He is our fellow Dagestani. What else can I say.""Message 3:

""Commander of 25th brigade Arkhipov - 200th. The 3rd rota was destroyed in the very first minutes. 25th brigade has been devastated, reduced to zero, nothing left of them. The 95th brigade is said to have been destroyed as well. Taman division too. From all of the tank battalions that we have the battalion of Petrov did the best, with combat(commander) Petrov. He was shielding infantry with tank. He destroyed at least 6 enemy vehicles. ""

Message 4:""Summing it all up, lads. **The preparedness of these soldiers we saw here(talking about Russian soldiers) is terrible. They don't have proper helmets, vests, the uniform is terrible, they are dressed like homeless. The conditions are terrible. I can understand the war condition - ok, but the uniform is just nowhere. And these guys are sent to fight people who were preparing for 8 years to fight us. Ukraine was preparing Azov fighers for 8 years to fight us. And all these Private Milittary with international fighers from black(original:negros) to indian. The guys are saying they saw this all. They are being shot at from all sides and they don't know from where.""**

Message 5:""The battalion of SOBR and Rosgvardia, basically burned to the ground. Medical Vehicle(Ural) were 6 were sleeping got hit - they all burned alive. Out of 40 SOBR soldiers 6 lived, the rest got burned down. RosGvardia got hit with RPGS from all sides, no one left alive. Other RosGvardia battalions who were on their way in turned back and said they won't be fighting. It is fking hell. What we have left is just laughable. It is Ural and Kamaz. And 4 tanks but they can't shoot. It is fking hell lads. It is a massive failure. ""

This is the translation of the audio messages from one of the Russian fighers. He is from Dagestan and shared his experience privately with his friends back in Russia. These has been made available publicly.Here is my translation of what he says, which I think is quite interesting to learn. I can tell for sure he has Caucasian(from Caucasus) accent and this is rather authentic than staged.Video from Telegram:

Message 1:""Lads, hello all. I am here with Rusik, Carev, Max Belov and youngsters. What can I say. Everything going is fking crazy, lads. 3 squads BTGRs were sent to Ukraine. 1st BTGR was completely fked. 2nd BTGR is holding up but no idea what state they are in. 3 BTGR: Zampolit(low ranking commander) left with 4-5 Motalygas and a few Urals(vehicles). No idea what state they are in. ""

Message 2:""Then, yesterday night 60 guys on Urals and Kamazes arrived from BTGR 1. They are saying only them left from the whole BTGR. Combat(some sort of commander) of the first battalion of infantry has been captured. In our brigade there are lots of 200s(dead). The Vahta(transport) that we used to get from Kursk to Belgorod says he was ferrying 200s the whole day yesterday. The driver is fking shocked. He is our fellow Dagestani. What else can I say.""Message 3:

""Commander of 25th brigade Arkhipov - 200th. The 3rd rota was destroyed in the very first minutes. 25th brigade has been devastated, reduced to zero, nothing left of them. The 95th brigade is said to have been destroyed as well. Taman division too. From all of the tank battalions that we have the battalion of Petrov did the best, with combat(commander) Petrov. He was shielding infantry with tank. He destroyed at least 6 enemy vehicles. ""

Message 4:""Summing it all up, lads. The preparedness of these soldiers we saw here(talking about Russian soldiers) is terrible. They don't have proper helmets, vests, the uniform is terrible, they are dressed like homeless. The conditions are terrible. I can understand the war condition - ok, but the uniform is just nowhere. And these guys are sent to fight people who were preparing for 8 years to fight us. Ukraine was preparing Azov fighers for 8 years to fight us. And all these Private Milittary with international fighers from black(original:negros) to indian. The guys are saying they saw this all. They are being shot at from all sides and they don't know from where.""

Message 5:""The battalion of SOBR and Rosgvardia, basically burned to the ground. Medical Vehicle(Ural) were 6 were sleeping got hit - they all burned alive. Out of 40 SOBR soldiers 6 lived, the rest got burned down. RosGvardia got hit with RPGS from all sides, no one left alive. Other RosGvardia battalions who were on their way in turned back and said they won't be fighting. It is fking hell. What we have left is just laughable. It is Ural and Kamaz. And 4 tanks but they can't shoot. It is fking hell lads. It is a massive failure. """,False,1645976920.0,t3_t2ovz6,t3_t2ovz6,,0,179,0,179,0,0,

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has said if Russia uses nuclear weapons against Ukraine it will be a ""catastrophe for the world"".

""But it will not break us down,"" he claimed.

His comment came after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to put its nuclear forces on ""special alert"" - the highest level of alert.

Speaking at a news conference, Kuleba said: ""This order by President Putin came shortly after the announcement was made about two delegations ready to meet [for talks].

""We see this announcement or this order as an attempt to raise the stakes and to put additional pressure on the Ukrainian delegation.

""But we will not give in to this pressure. We will approach these talks with a very simple approach. We go there to listen [to what] what Russia has to say and we will tell them what we think of all this.""

He added: ""Ukraine is not falling. We are bleeding, but we continue to successfully defend ourselves.""

Many of the younger members of this sub have never had a serious threat of nuclear weapons being used and have never had to even think about them beyond hyperbolic commentary in video games. Their questions are understandable as they are coming to grips with the existential threat of nuclear war. I would add for those readers though; the threat has existed your entire life. 

That said I would urge people with those questions to go read about MAD and understand the concepts of nuclear deterrence. Going nuclear is the final option. There is no turning back. It is also not a decision that Putin can make on this own. Technically the choice is his but any number of points along the chain can veto it in practice if not in protocol. He can say ""launch the nukes"" and his military can just say ""no"".

The western press hasn’t figured it out yet, so here it is:  Russia has been defeated on the battlefield and it is desperate.  Journalists cannot comprehend that a “superpower” like Russia could be defeated in battle by a non-nuclear power military and citizen militias, but that’s exactly what happened.

How?

First, Russian forces were delayed for weeks in launching the invasion because the West kept publicly disclosing their invasion strategy in detail, throwing Russia off and causing it to waste valuable supplies idling at the border.

Second, the invasion itself was a Blitzkrieg-style invasion aimed at capturing Kyiv, and that operation failed.  When Zelenskyy was on TV last week saying “tonight the fate of Ukraine will be decided”, he wasn’t talking hyperbolically - he knew that because US intelligence was telling him exactly what the Russian strategy was, in real time.  When Russia didn’t achieve a breakthrough, the battle was effectively lost (Putin thought Zelenskyy would flee in the face of overwhelming Russian forces, so he miscalculated).

The attack on Kharkiv last night shows how desperate the Russians are.  If you were watching the news last night, you would have seen Russia sending in its reserves - older tanks and weaponry - in the northeast area near Kharkiv.  That is because they wanted to seize a major Ukrainian city to increase their bargaining position, and probably wagered that Ukraine forces would be focused on defending Kyiv, so Kharkiv may be a softer target.  Again, they failed because Russia underestimated the strength of determined defense in an urban environment.

Now Russian columns are sitting idle on major roads that they used for the Blitzkrieg attacks, particularly the roads north of Kyiv.  Those forces have run out of supplies, and Russia is terrible at the most difficult aspect of warfare: logistics.  On top of that, their supply lines are highly vulnerable to counterattack, and Ukraine forces control all of the countryside apart from the major roads.  The Russian position is this precarious.

Why no Russian bombers in the sky?

The press keeps saying this is because Russia doesn’t want mass casualties.  This is false - Russia does not care.  However, Russia doesn’t have clear air superiority yet and may never achieve it and they know that.  Put simply, those bombers and more advanced fighter escorts are too valuable to risk because Russia cannot easily replace them if shot down.  Ukraine has shot down a non-trivial number of Russian aircraft already, and they just don’t know what Ukraine has received from the West in terms of portable AA systems.  Moreover, reducing those large cities to rubble may be a theoretical possibility, but it wouldn’t actually ensure victory and might make military operations even more difficult, while raising the prospect of a UN no-fly zone.

Russia is on the ropes now. Their invasion strategy has utterly failed, and Putin has no good options.  He needs to delay because he can’t even retreat at this point. We are at the point where defeat could tip into fiasco very quickly (if not already there).",False,1645974330.0,t3_t2ovz6,t3_t2ovz6,,0,120,0,120,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

> Russia initially said it did not want talks, then said it wanted talks with conditions. Now, after a series of military setbacks that some observers say may have shocked Russian president Vladimir Putin, the conditions have been dropped – which Kuleba said was “already a victory”.

> One element of the talks, Kuleba said, are that Belarus agreed it would not use military force against Ukraine “between now and the moment that the talks wrap up”.

President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office said Belarus President Aleksander Lukashenko called the Ukrainian President earlier Sunday.  
""The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,"" his office said.  
""Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation's travel, meeting and return,"" the office continued.

I'm no expert in foreign policy / wartime negotiations, but doesn't it seem a little dangerous for the Ukranian negotiation team to trust the Belarus president to keep things in line when he's clearly been acting in bad faith since before the invasion started?

Nuclear war has been much closer in the past. This isn't even close.

Putin is clearly not a rational actor, but he does not have immediate control over the launch of weapons - he can't tap an app on his phone and launch missiles at will. That's not to say a strike can't happen, but there are plenty of people who would need to be involved and informally sense check Putin if he initiated a first strike.

I can’t find the thread but someone posted a really great breakdown of why Russia’s supply chain is so fucked. 

The big takeaway is that the Russian military is insanely corrupt (no surprise). But that the top brass can’t admit to the scope of corruption without implicating themselves. 

Putin may have very well thought they had gas and supplies. His generals may have told him so. The problem is they were taking fuel and oil money to pad their own pockets. It also makes sense you’d skim from the fuel budget because you can claim the fuel was used. But if a rocket doesn’t show up then that isn’t going unnoticed. 

TLDR: Russian generals were skimming from the fuel fund but can’t admit it without admitting to their own corruption.",False,1645973184.0,t3_t2ovz6,t3_t2ovz6,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Russia is in an awful position.

For those in immediate danger/war zone:

I can't think of much to say other than words of advice to be prepared.

Fill your bathtub and any sealed containers with water. make sure containers are as clean as possible

Ration food and eat things that are perishable first.

Prepare the safest room in your dwelling as a bunker. Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.

Pack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.

Electricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.

Keep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.

Know which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.

You can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.

If there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.

Keep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.

Get to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them & your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.

Message any of us we will be checking.

Stay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.

May Putin burn to dust.

addition: men 18-60 are no longer allowed to leave

***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.

Try to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.

Another user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:

This is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! Шановні українці!

У соцмережах я чув, що поширюються фейкові новини (скоріше за все, підтримувані Росією тролі), що польський кордон закритий.

Це брехня.

Якщо ви шукаєте притулку – йдіть до польського кордону. Ми готові до вашого приїзду. На кордоні готові пункти прийому, де ви можете знайти притулок, їжу, медичну та правову допомогу.

Note: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians. Poland is absolutely opening its doors, and here best the comment with the relevant info and links to the polish website in both english and Ukrainian.

Addition: As stated here many times i want to repeat that you should not share any media or information that can give away the location of Ukrainian troops but do share information about Russian troops.

Addition2 from the [original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/t0e4gw/lpt_if_your_city_is_being_randomly_bombed_do_not/) this post originated from in short:

do not post the exact location of a mortar impact as information on the media can be used to calibrate. if you hear a whistling sound, get down to the ground right away, this will minimize your chance getting hit by shrapnel. don't gather around injured people after an explosion. a follow up attack may hit the same spot. people with experience should help them as quickly as possible.

https://twitter.com/pwnallthethings/status/1497937591710195717?s=21

> First, this is a deterrence action against the west, both conventionally and western sanctions. It's a big 'keep out' sign, not a real intent to escalate to nuclear force or aimed at ukr.

> From the operations so far, it looks like R intended a morale victory with fast surrender of UA forces. That didn't pan out, and this conflict is likely to escalate savagely with new commitments of conventional force. This is a 'keep out of it' to the west

> The two big sanctions that rise to the level of a strategic threat are the sanctions against the central bank, and airspace closures making RU mainland-Kaliningrad connections look precarious

> The inevitable response to the R nuclear posture change is that nuclear forces elsewhere will now also go to high readiness

> Unfortunately, there is a good chance those postures will remain on high alert on both sides now until the conflict ends. Which could be a while. The huge risk is not so much immediate, but mistakes and missignalling that leads to horrific consequences until that happens

> Key thing now is for the leaders of nuclear powers to make clear that *they* will not be the source of that escalation, and to recognize the real red lines that can lead to it

> So EU, US, and leaders of those powers need to signal quickly and loudly the circumstances under which escalation can occur. Namely, no use without a strike by R, and to loudly commit that they understand and will not step over the red line triggers

> For example, while airspace closures in EU will occur, under no circumstances will transit or logistics between R and Kaliningrad be disrupted. Under no circumstances will their conventional forces engage directly with R forces.

> That sanctions will be severe and life-changing to R, it's govt, and it's people, but will, under no circumstances, rise to the level of preventing R undertaking its core sovereign activities

> And that responses in cyberspace will not be taken that that have the functional or kinetic effect of disabling the core infrastructure necessary in a modern sovereign nation that would, under LOAC, rise to the level of an armed attack

> During this period, defense ministers, foreign ministers, and heads of state should be particularly careful to ensure that they do not announce new policies or sanctions without consulting with experts and lawyers to ensure they don't unexpectedly step over those lines

> This doesn't escalate to nuclear conflict by itself, it needs serious miscommunication to get there, but given how uncareful EU was in reading R MFA prior to conflict, and how uncareful talk has been since, it is important now for them to be much more careful in signalling

> That all said, this is bad news for everyone, but also a really really ominous sign for ukr that this war is going to get a lot, lot more ugly in conventional force very soon.",False,1645975433.0,t3_t2ovz6,t3_t2ovz6,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

Putin and his oligarchy want out. Before Russia gets economically ruined by war against western equipped Ukraine and sanctions. But he can't just leave, it makes him and Russia look weak. 

He wants a real life macguffin. An excuse for everyone to (somewhat) forget this happened. I think he will fire a tactical nuke. At something important but unpopulated.

Putin is in a weird place right now. According to the intel yesterday, he's frustrated due to the war being difficult for him; he apparently underestimated Ukraine. Almost the entire world is against him now. The sanctions, especially the SWIFT removal, will have an effect. The oligarches must be pretty pissed at him. Russia, supposedly one of the top military powers in the world is having difficulty defeating a small country in combat (not occupation, but combat). This makes him look very bad in front of NATO.

There have been reports of TOS-1 systems being brought to bear against possibly Kharkiv or Kiev, and people are rightfully worried. It's a formidable system, with a 3.5 km max effective range (6 km for the TOS-1A), and the ability to affect an area of 200-400m\^2. It kills through overpressure, basically rupturing internal organs. The indiscriminate nature of the weapon system and its templated use against these two major cities is a worrying development in concerns to the massive civilian casualties it would cause. However, I would like to present some insight on why this weapon system may not have the devastating battlefield effects that we are worried about.  
  
Capabilities  
Above, I outlined the capabilities of the TOS-1 in terms of its killing power. However, the whole system has to be taken into account. The TOS-1 is built upon a modified T-72 chassis. From this data point, we know that it will need to travel along routes viable for armored movement (hard surfaces) to avoid sinking in the mud like so many other Russian heavy equipment we have seen. This also tells us that it does not have amphibious capabilities and must use bridges or pre-identified fords. This restricts the avenues of approach that the vehicle must take; essentially the same routes that we are seeing armored columns and logistics trains get ambushed on. Being the danger that it is, I am sure that it is on the UA forces high payoff/high value target list, and would not reach its intended destination.  
  
Logistics  
We've seen a reluctance from the Russian forces to bring their MLRS systems to bear against civil locations (for the most part since Ukraine is not looking like Chechnya). However, the line of contact to the southeast with its many trenches would be the ideal location to use this weapon system. As far as I know, there have been no reports of this being used there. What's most likely happening is that the TOS-1 is being used as a fear tactic by the Russian government. These vehicles did not enter widespread production, and considering the sorry state of Russian logistics, probably doesn't have the support it needs to conduct multiple fire missions. Furthermore, being on a T-72 chassis gives this platform poor fuel efficiency, running the risk of running out of fuel once it enters theater. The Buratino is just iconic in how terrifying it is. It's a ""flamethrower"" on top of a tank!  
  
What we should really be wary of are any developments concerning the BM-30 Smerch. This weapon system can deliver thermobaric payloads from 70 km away, providing the same effect as a Buratino without the associated risk.",False,1645972325.0,t3_t2ovz6,t3_t2ovz6,,0,11,0,11,0,0,

A new world order has still not been found. Finding it can impossibly be up to Germany or it’s parliament alone. However, we will have to do our part. A world in which there are wars, in which nations threaten each other with weapons of mass destruction, in which millions of people live hunger and misery, in which human rights are violated on a daily basis, and in which the natural basis of life of future generations is destroyed, is no just world.“

Ukraine on the other hand has a lot of backing from the international community, everything short of direct military support. The Russians either can't or won't stop supplies and equipment from flowing into Ukraine from Western Europe. They're getting a lot of help. 

The question is, how long can they keep it up? It's barely been a week, and Putin is not ready to throw in the towel. Exhaustion and casualties will take their toll on the Ukrainians as well, on people and equipment. Morale probably won't break because they're fighting for home, but the body can only take so much. I don't want to be the guy cheering on an expansion of the war, but I seriously think that the Ukrainians desperately need another nation to come in with direct military support. They'll need the extra manpower to relieve their beleaguered troops.

In the end, I think it'll end like the Soviet war with the Finns.

The article has a scary picture of the Azov group at the top, but even their interviewee openly admits


>Dmitri Kovalevich: There are some 5-6% of Ukrainians sharing pro-nationalist or pro-Nazi ideology. There are some 5-6% of commited communists or sympathizers. The rest support those who are winning at the moment. Last years millions of Ukrainians migrated: some 3.5 million to Russia and they would like to come back in case of change of the government. Some 3.5 - labor migrants in western countries, they tend to share Western media narratives.





BY HIS (a member of a communist group that is banned in Ukraine but provides aid to Donbas) OWN ADMISSION they are not any more prevalent than Communist believers in Ukraine, and by his own admission the majority of the people don't care about those political ideologies.

The big takeaway is that the Russian military is insanely corrupt (no surprise). But that the top brass can’t admit to the scope of corruption without implicating themselves. 

Putin may have very well thought they had gas and supplies. His generals may have told him so. 

The problem is they were taking fuel and oil money to pad their own pockets. It makes sense you’d skim from the fuel budget because you can claim the fuel was used. If a rocket doesn’t show up then that isn’t going unnoticed, so instead you buy half the gas you were supposed to and pretend you bought the whole thing. 

Tbh I find this amusing. It’s just like when I fuck up with my boss — if the issue is big enough, I can’t admit to it without admitting to my own incompetence. Now imagine your boss is Putin and you stole from the military fund. Instead the generals are letting round after round of teenage conscripts die in a poorly planned war because the only other option is to admit their corruption.

But he was also dismissive about their usage in war too, because he would always answer that the best self-deterrence from using them is by thinking of Grandma.

My read is this:  Ukraine cannot stop the Russian army.  Numbers may be of limited value at a certain point, but the fact is that the russian military is so much larger than the Ukrainian military that they can just continue sending bodies until things give way.   Remember, Ukrainian forces have to win every time; russian forces only have to capture a city once.  So Russia can wear them down by attrition.   Think about the casualty numbers Ukraine has inflicted, about 4k soldiers at this point?  Russia amassed 190k soldiers at the border.

With that said, Russia can’t just let this invasion keep going.  They aren’t doing well with logistics, and they are facing an extremely hostile populace (think US invasion of Iraq except *way* worse).  And every day the war goes on, the richest and most powerful Russians lose money and influence.  So while the Ukrainian military can’t outright beat the russian military, the russian military can still lose.  At this point, “victory” for Russia might just mean capturing a few key cities, hanging a “mission accomplished” banner in Moscow, backing out, and then quietly ignoring when those cities are immediately retaken.  And even that is seeming like an increasingly heavy lift as Ukrainian forces don’t have to worry about the same supply issues as the Russians, and military tech is being sent to them by major allied powers.

Meanwhile, civil unrest grows by the day in Russia, and will only increase as their currency becomes meaningless. As a staging ground for further expansion, this conflict has only made a laughing stock of Russia in the eyes of their opposition. Do you seriously see any viability in pursuing future aggression, when their foray into Ukraine has proven far more of a challenge than anybody could have expected?

Putin may 'win' this war, but he's lost the facade of power he's built over the past two decades. Thousands of lives have been needlessly destroyed, and for what?

He's a madman who won't agree to anything, and he's willing to murder 10,000 people and risk the deaths of 250,000 more - to get his imaginary Russian golden age back.  I'm presuming we get to negotiate with the Oligarchs, or whomever the FSB puts in Putin's place.

--------------------

I agree with you. Crimea was 95% ethnic Russians all the way through. One moron long ago who believed the USSR would live forever changed it's regional alignment. That should totally be undone.  yeah yeah borders are absolute - until they're not.

Luhansk and Donetsk - someone needs to recognize that a decent proportion of people within there were not happy at not having a federal government of their liking 8 years ago  - to the point where they were willing to take up arms.  (Also they were scared into it by Azov like morons headed their way, and on top of that they were forced into it by extremists who took over the local governments, and police that didn't want to fight against locals seizing the local government offices.)

The hard part is having someone like Putin willing to sabotage negotiations by supporting extremists and/or puppet governments, and Putin and those puppets not allowing an actual fair plebiscite on the issue.

And of course, feverent Ukranians demanding their borders be set back 20 years, damned the cost.

There are many examples in which a virtuous single party controll is prefered for a time over a dysfunctional multiparty system filled with bad actors.

Not that America was corruption free prior, only that increased political competition from negative actors actually increased corruption.

Imo, eventually the long goal of society should be to reach a star trek esque society of mostly general concensus and less political competition. The road getting there is very far and rocky however.

When I wrote about heroes, it was also a thought about the importance of creating the right myth. That is why in my text there is nothing about the man who blew up the bridge (I am sure that he is really a hero of his country who accomplished a feat) or about a story about a Russian warship (I am also sure that some of the Ukrainian defenders really fought and died, and some surrendered, which now allowed us to see this blind spot).  
Also, when I write about the creation of ""national heroes"", I do not mean real heroes of  humanism (objective), but the process of creating the right myth that corresponds to a political and historical request.

Given that he's announcing stricter measures instead of using them directly, this implies his hands are somewhat tied and he's trying to scare Ukraine into surrendering.

It's clear as day that if he could, he would have done it long ago.

One isn’t looking good given their already terrible logistics, and it’d also tear away whatever thin facade he has back home of not actually warring with Ukraine.

Two may happen, but similar to above. 

Third is an extremely unlikely option. If he nukes either of the two largest cities their strategic value is gone and discontent at home will be enormous. It would also force NATO to respond. Not sure if he’s using Nixons “act fucking crazy” strategy or he may do so just to lay down an iron hand, but using nukes would mean the end of Russia as a state and end of him as a ruler in the end.",False,1645971798.0,t3_t2ovz6,t1_hyn9jjz,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Ukraine isn't some first world power. It's relatively poor and the military propped up by Western interests. That's it.

I agree. But... 


>Ukraine doesn't ""Strengthen"" NATO, it just gives them a longer border to lean against to make the Russian government more uncomfortable and destabilized than it already is.

Agree also. Where I differ from you is that I am saying that NATO is going to changing approach towards Russia from now on. We used to be wary of them. I have a feeling the curtain has just been yanked away and we are that they are really not much more than a second-rate power that claims to still have a lot of functioning nukes. I have my doubts about how many of those nukes are actually ready. I suspect their nuclear arsenal has been badly degraded since 1991. In any case I think we are probably going to be pushing Putin and Russia around a lot more from now on.

Looks like it worked since they are everywhere since day 2, also you ignored that only few % tanks were used to to the supply issue . My point is they can drag this long as they want to they have xtimes numbers 


>No shit. How does this apply to the outcome of the peace talks?

Just FYI since you are just following western media , the Russians have brought in their artillery and resupplied their forces where they have established dominance.

It is basically like swastika right now. And they are waiving it from their balcony.
