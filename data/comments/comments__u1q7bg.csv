**UK investigating claim Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine:**

The UK's armed forces minister says London is working to confirm whether Russian forces have used chemical weapons in Ukraine.  
  
James Heappey tells BBC Breakfast that reports such munitions were used against the besieged southern city of Mariupol have been circulating on Ukrainian social media, but neither British defence intelligence nor their counterparts in Kyiv have been able to verify those claims.  
  
Heappey adds that the UK is ""working urgently"" to find out if chemical weapons were used. He repeats the UK foreign secretary's comments on Monday night that Russia will be ""held to account"" and that any use of chemical weapons is ""abhorrent"" and ""crosses a line"".  
  
If there is proof such weapons have been used then ""all options are on the table"" in terms of the international response, Heappey says.  
  
""Verifying it is clearly very important,"" Heappey adds. ""If chemical weapons were used it is a very important moment for our PM \[Boris Johnson\] and other heads of government around the world.

Grr. I guess somebody has to ask the stupid questions, I just hate this tone. Turning a non-problem into a headline.

What I'm reading from this is that the US had 20 years worth of Stinger missiles in reserve and we can give a huge supply away without hurting our defensive capabilities, and replace it all in five short years.

Additionally, these missiles are being used for their intended purpose - defending America's allies from our enemies on the world stage. Like if an American isn't pulling the trigger it doesn't count as supplies well-used?

Thirdly, no duh there's a limit on our missile supply (but again we're not even near it). We don't need infinite guns so we can sustain a forever war, that would be pointless and barbaric. We just have to be 1% more sustainable than the Russian efforts. No problems there",False,1649788007.0,t3_u1q7bg,t3_u1q7bg,,0,55,0,55,0,0,

* T-72 : $1.2 Million
* BMP3 : $800,000

And it is believed that Russia does not have access to all of the materials to replace these destroyed vehicles.

**Edit Extra Fact**: The total inventory of US Javelin missiles, of which Ukraine currently has received a third of, is equal to about 50% of the entire known compliment of Russian armor units both active and in reserve in the entire Russian Military.

Day 48 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Shelling just doesn’t stop and it’s accompanied by missile strikes, with occasional barrages from MLRSs. Thankfully my area continues to be pretty safe, but there are constant reports of explosions from eastern part of the city, especially from Saltivka, where there are basically no undamaged buildings left.

Half of our city already looks apocalyptic, so much destruction and it has only been 48 days. Putin saying that he is protecting Donbass by doing this is just laughable. Donetsk and Luhansk look pretty much untouched after the alleged “8 years of shelling” that they love to parrot, while any city that Russians “liberated” looks like it went through an apocalypse. Why the fuck do Russians think that people from Donbass want to be a part of their so called people’s republics after they destroyed their cities?

All of this just makes no sense. What weirds me out the most is just how indifferent Russians are about this whole situation. Complete strangers offer help and worry about us more (which we really do appreciate) than our own relatives from Russia. They don’t even ask us if everything is alright nor care if we are alive. 

Even my own father just completely stopped answering after I told him to stop lecturing me on how I should think (the usual zombie speak about how Ukraine is spreading more fakes than Russia and that we are shelling ourselves), safe to say I will never talk to him again after this, instead of helping he just disappeared. Good thing this war brought out the true nature of people so that we know who we should completely cut off from our lives.

*The Ukrainian plan has proven sound, but the dearth of military assistance in the lead-up to the conflict has cost them dearly. Russia attacked along multiple axes, with large, armored thrusts pushing south from Belarus, southwest from Belgorod, northwest from Rostov, and north from Crimea. When the war began, Ukraine could not safely reposition its forces beneath the enemy air threat. They only had enough anti-tank weapons to blunt one axis and chose to use these to defend Kyiv. Lacking a means to attack Russian artillery, they saw their cities turned to rubble. They succeeded in defending the capital but lost considerable ground in the south and east. If Ukraine can blunt the next offensive on the Donbas, it will need to reconstitute its forces for a protracted struggle.*

*(...)*

*The Ukrainians are bracing for an offensive northward from Mariupol and southward from around Kharkiv. They face a hard month of fighting. The Russian units now appreciate what they are up against and with fewer lines to supply they should be able to bring a greater concentration of air and artillery to bear. The aim will be to surround the Ukrainian troops in the Joint Forces Operating area in the Donbas. At the same time the Ukrainian forces are reasonably confident they can hold, though it will cost them. Ukrainian troops now have only one front against which they must concentrate, where they enjoy numerical parity with the Russian forces and have stationed many of their best troops. They should impose a grueling rate of attrition on their adversaries.*

“Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not, we are currently measuring this campaign in days. We ought to expect to measure it in months, if not – in the scheme of things – in years,” he said.



“The most likely immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas, with a Russian regime able to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a potential launch point for a subsequent campaign.

> Closing down of press isn't indicative of being a fascist, just a crackdown on alternative press to tighten control on flow of narrative. All of Russian state media like RT or Sputnik was banned in the west, which I think prompted the knee-jerk reaction of banning alternative media here like Meduza or Dozhd.
Facebook allowed wishing death upon ""Russian invaders"" on its platform in official statement, which prompted the removal of Instagram and Facebook from here as well.
IIRC any protest of reasonable size needs to be sanctioned and authorities informed beforehand, and not just in Russia. I can assure you that you won't be arrested for standing alone with that sign by the kremlin, but you'll attract a lot of attention and will probably have to be defended by our police from pro putin people trying to beat you up.

Do you realize how ridiculously brainwashed you sound right now? No country that is conducting a justified operation needs to close down all media besides state run media to ""control the narrative""... even if the west banned state-run Russian media, why does Russia need to ban EVERYTHING but state run media? That is like the US banning everything but NPR and there's no chance in hell that will happen. That is the most fascist thing I've ever heard,  it is even on the list of things to watch out for with creeping fascism. If you can't see that simple truth you are a bit blind to reality.

April 12/22 : 00 ID : 62552f264909af00134cabed _

The forty-eighth era of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion began.
The full-scale armed aggression of the Russian Federation against our State continues.

The enemy is trying to complete the regrouping and relocation of units to areas of concentration in the Belgorod and Voronezh regions of the Russian Federation, as well as the relocation of air and space forces to airfields in the immediate vicinity of Ukraine's eastern borders.

The Russian occupiers, ignoring the norms of international humanitarian law, continue to use tactics of placing equipment and manpower directly in housing. Thus, in the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, the occupiers use the premises of agricultural enterprises, energy and social infrastructure, central areas of settlements. Cases of enemy fighting in civilian clothes have been reported.

In the Volyn and Polissya directions, the enemy did not take active action. No changes in the position and actions of enemy units in these areas have been recorded.
In the northern direction, the enemy completes the redeployment of individual units to the eastern operational zone. Units of the 41st All-Military Army of the Central Military District are being relocated to designated areas in the Belgorod and Voronezh oblasts.

In the Slobozhansky direction, enemy troops continue to partially block the city of Kharkiv. In the area of ​​the city of Izyum, the enemy is fighting with separate units of the 1st Panzer and 20th All-Army. Conducts air reconnaissance in order to identify the positions of units of our troops and determine the routes of their deployment.

In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the enemy is fighting and holding certain borders with forces from the Southern Military District. Carries out the movement of additional units to conduct hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
There are signs of strengthening the air defense system in the areas of Melitopol and Ilovaisk.

It is likely that in the future the enemy will try to take control of the city of Mariupol, capture Popasna and lead an offensive in the direction of Kurakhove in order to reach the administrative borders of Donetsk region.
In the South Bug direction, the enemy holds certain boundaries by units of the Southern Military District. Replenishes regular losses in manpower and equipment. It tries to ensure the survival of its own control points. The enemy does not stop trying to gain a foothold on the administrative borders of Kherson region.

In the waters of the Black and Azov Seas, enemy naval groups continue to perform tasks related to the isolation of the area of ​​hostilities, reconnaissance, and fire support of ground units.

The threat of the enemy's use of missile weapons remains.
In the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, our soldiers repulsed six enemy attacks, destroyed four tanks, five armored units, twenty-six units of motor vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.

The Air Force of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has hit seven air targets in the previous day: one plane, two helicopters and four unmanned aerial vehicles.

We will report on the total losses of the enemy later.

I often read the indignation of non-post-Soviet people about the numerous senseless victims, war crimes, losses - most do not understand the main thing. 

On the territories of the former Russian Empire, human life is historically worth about the same as in China (spoiler: it costs nothing). The basic logic of all leaders: ordinary people are slaves, a resource, cannon fodder. If something suddenly happens and a lot of people are killed, you just need to pass some law to increase the demographics. Women will have more children -> people will reappear. 
Last week was the first time in a month and a half that I didn't protest on the weekend (there are major rallies in Moscow on the weekend). No, I haven't lost faith in the opposition, it's just that I had a family disaster. 

A couple of days before the war started, my very beloved grandfather, managed to get covid.  He sat alone for a week in a country house and set up a bunker (he was a former Soviet diplomat, so when he retired in the mid-90s, he immediately bought a country house on the former military base outside Moscow, which had been rebuilt as small cottages. 

He paid as much as $5,000 extra for his own small bunker left over from World War II and still convinces us it was the best 60th birthday present ever. We all thought he had age-related brain changes, and for last 25 years bunker was mostly used like a cellar where food, wine, canned food and all sorts of products were stored, which had no place in the refrigerator. I thought he is just a child of Cold War times, always remembered to buy some extra sugar and 10 years shelf life cans, but in the context of current events, it turns out he was right). 

Anyway, in early March, we forcibly transported him to Moscow and called an ambulance. He was put in hospital, in Kommunarka, the best and main Covid hospital in Russia with huge capacity: more than 1500 people, 200 thousand square meters. 
During the three weeks that he was sick he managed to get into the ICU with a cytokine storm, luckily for us the doctors were able to save him and last his life.

Wednesday he was discharged to the general care unit. We had a very good specialist, a very competent infectious disease doctor, and she promised us that within 2-3 weeks he should be fine and we would take him home. Friday night into Saturday, she called me. She was literally hysterical. They had received an order ""from the government"" that all the covidariums in Moscow were closing and turning into military hospitals. And by 12 a.m. Monday, all hospital wards must be vacated, no matter what. 

The same goes for intensive care units. For three days I drove around Moscow and tried to find some hospital that would agree to take him for treatment and recovery at least another week (I remind you that he was released from intensive care less than a week ago). Thank God I succeeded (although it took a lot of bribes, prayers, and threats). Yesterday afternoon we transported him in a paid ambulance. 

Today I had to talk to his former doctor again: she is horrified. They had been retrained for two years: from oncologists and internists, mammologists and dermatologists, they all had to become covid specialists and infectious disease specialists. Now they are being retrained as military surgeons (again): the southern regions have literally run out of places in hospitals for the wounded. I asked her what happened to those who were on ventilators in intensive care - you can't just put them in a car and transport them. She didn't answer, but cried. 

Good morning, Motherland.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday will publish the findings of its investigation into human rights abuses and atrocities committed in the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, according to the spokesperson for the US Mission to the OSCE.

It is unclear what the findings of the report will be at this point.

The report is the product of a weeks-long fact-finding mission led by three experts chosen by Ukraine from an OSCE list of experts. That investigation was triggered after 45 countries invoked a rare OSCE mechanism —the Moscow Mechanism — that is used to investigate human rights concerns

From CNN's Celine Alkhaldi

Ukrainian officials claim to have destroyed a Russian weapons depot in Novoaidar, Luhansk region.

CNN has geolocated a video and images shared to social media that appear to show the aftermath of that attack.

On Monday, Serhii Haidai, head of the Luhansk Regional Military Administration, said in a Facebook post that Ukrainian forces had destroyed a Russian ""ammunition warehouse"" near a Russian settlement in Luhansk.  

In a video shared by Russian state media RIA Novosti, Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) People’s Militia officer Roman Ivanov said the Ukrainian strikes on Novoaidar destroyed “more than 20 homes, along with a warehouse filled with chemical fertilizers.”

Haidai denied Russian claims that Ukrainians targeted residential buildings.

“When it comes to the necessary weapons, we still depend on the supply, on our partners. Unfortunately, we are not getting as much as we need to end this war sooner. To completely destroy the enemy on our land. And to fulfill those tasks that are obvious to each of our people. In particular, to unblock Mariupol,” Zelensky said. 
“If we got jets and enough heavy armored vehicles, the necessary artillery, we would be able to do it,” he said, “But we still have to agree on this. We still have to persuade. We still have to squeeze out the necessary decisions. I am sure that we will get almost everything we need. But not only time is being lost. The lives of Ukrainians are being lost. Lives that can no longer be returned.”

Some context: Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Monday that the ""defense of Mariupol continues"" amid heavy fighting between Ukrainian forces inside the besieged city and Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. 

Ukrainian officials have said around 100,000 civilians remain in the city, which has come under heavy bombardment. Ukraine's defense of Mariupol has tied down Russian units and hampered their efforts to solidify a land corridor from the Russian border to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.

The defense of Mariupol has also been a national rallying point for Ukrainians, and the destruction of the city has become a symbol of Russia's indiscriminate use of firepower.

From CNN's Shania Shelton

Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in a newly reckless manner with the invasion of Ukraine, former US President Barack Obama said in an interview that aired Tuesday on NBC’s “Today” show.

“Putin has always been ruthless against his own people as well as others. He has always been somebody who's wrapped up in this twisted, distorted sense of grievance and ethnic nationalism,” Obama said. “That part of Putin, I think, has always been there. What we've seen with the invasion of Ukraine is him being reckless in a way that you might not have anticipated eight, 10 years ago, but the danger was always there.”

The former president declined to directly answer a question about what, in hindsight, he would have done differently while in office, including when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

From CNN's Oren Liebermann

The United States is willing to consider sending more weapons systems that require additional training to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, based on ongoing conversations between the two militaries.

“If we determine in concert with the Ukrainians that there (are) additional systems that they need that we can provide but that might require some training, then we’re certainly willing to talk to them about that,” the official said at a briefing with reporters Tuesday.

The official said the fact that the systems may require more training is “not prohibitive.”

The official used the example of Switchblade drones. Ukrainian forces were not trained on the suicide drones, but the US determined that the system might help the Ukrainian military and found a way to train a small number of Ukrainian forces on it in 24 to 48 hours.

“And the evidence is mounting, it’s different than it was last week, the more evidence that’s coming out,” he continued, “Literally the horrible things that the Russians have done in Ukraine, and we’re going to only learn more and more about the devastation — and we’ll let the lawyers decide internationally it qualifies, but it sure seems that way to me.”

Earlier Tuesday, in remarks from Menlo, Iowa, the President first cited the possibility Russia had committed genocide, in remarks on rising gas prices.

""Your family budget, your ability to fill up your tank, none of it should hinge on whether a dictator declares war and commits genocide a half a world away,"" he said.

Biden has previously stopped short of calling what is underway in Ukraine a genocide. His aides have said it doesn't yet rise to the level.

**What evidence is there of a chemical attack in Mariupol?**

As we've reported, rumours have been circulating on social media of a chemical weapons attack by Russian forces in the besieged city of Mariupol.  
  
The claims were first made yesterday by the Azov Battalion, a far-right Ukrainian militia fighting in the city.  
  
In a video shared on Telegram, the group's founder and former commander Andriy Biletskyy said chemicals had been dropped over the city's Azovstal steelworks, which was being guarded by the Azov Battalion.  
  
He said three people were injured, but no further evidence has been provided as yet.  
  
Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malya has said that, based on preliminary information, phosphorus munitions may have been used, but investigations are ongoing.  
  
Just yesterday, the spokesperson for Russia-backed Donetsk separatists, Eduard Basurin, publicly called for Russia to use its chemical, biological and radiological defence unit to ""smoke out""  
  
In an interview with Interfax news agency, he's since denied that separatist forces have used chemical weapons in their attempts to take Mariupol.",False,1649751795.0,t3_u1q7bg,t3_u1q7bg,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

anyways, i told her what I had heard, Azov started out as a sort of outlaw militia of bad guys from all over - neonazis etc, and I told her about how here in the US neonazis usually are criminal gangs, drug dealers etc (wife doesn't know a neonazi from what). And how they were folded into the Ukraine military and are now getting decimated (or worse) on the front lines in one of the worst battles of the war so far.

And her eyes light up and she says, 'Oh, so they're like the Liangshan bandits!'

Ok now. The Liangshan bandits are the heroes of one of the classics of Chinese literature, the [Water Margin] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Margin). Basically, a bunch of thugs and criminals (many of the more famous characters are really misunderstood and/or wrongly-accused, but plenty of them are legitimately nasty people) form a big bandit army to make their own way. The government hates them, but they have a sort of Robin Hood vibe so they are popular with the common people.

Now, where this resonates with Azov Brigade is here:

China is invaded by barbarians from the north, who come in and start ransacking cities, and the government is having trouble fighting them. So they offer amnesty to the Liangshan bandits, if they will help to resist the invaders. The bandits accept, and are sent to the front lines, where they heroically defeat the barbarian invasion, but are mostly killed in the process.

***What will Russia's strategy be?***  
  
""We are looking at a slow war of attrition,"" says Snetkov.  
  
""The Russians will be focused on grinding down Ukrainian positions and infrastructure.""  
  
She says Putin will attack from the north and from Mariupol, in the south - piling on pressure to extract concessions.  


  
  
***What will the fighting look like?***  
  
Snetkov believes Russia may target more railway infrastructure but fears there will be more civilian casualties too.  
  
""Whether they're planning to take over areas in the east by bombing them out of existence, at this stage we don't know.""  
  
She says it will take a while longer for heavy military equipment to arrive in Donbas, especially if it's travelling from Belarus or Russia.  


  
  
***How else could things change?***  
  
Meanwhile, she says Russia's appointment of General Alexander Dvornikov to oversee the invasion could make the Russian operational strategy more coordinated - with fewer generals sent to the front line.  
  
""What's been surprising until now is that the Russians have had no chief of command, or at least we haven't known who it was.""

TOKYO — The Japanese government is concerned about possible use of nuclear weapons in the Ukraine crisis, the top government spokesman said on Tuesday.

“We are seriously concerned about the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference.

“We, as a sole country that has suffered nuclear attacks during war, intends to keep on appealing firmly that any threat of the use of nuclear weapons, let alone their actual use, should never be allowed.” (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka, editing by Ed Osmond)""

Russia produces the majority of Europe's oil. With Ukraine under it's thumb it would have owned almost all of Europe's oil production, 20% of the world's Corn production, and 30% of the world's Wheat production. That's not a small amount and definitely a loaded hand to posses.

It pushed to achieve this by making the US isolationist by:
- getting Trump to leave NATO
- creating a trade war between China and the US
- becoming a silent ally with the US through Trump and his push to bring Russia to the world stage through organizations like the G7

This seems to coincide with the Putin apologists in the GOP being new congressmen and senators loyal to Trump.

It also explains the tampering with the 2016 election and the 2020 election in an effort to get Trump elected and keep him in office.

The disinformation campaign surrounding Russia vs Ukraine using QAnon.

Also the belief from Putin that NATO is a criminal organization that lied and undermined the Former Soviet states following the fall of the USSR.

If he had succeeded it would have created a drastic power shift on the global stage pushing Russia to the forefront, left the European states in a level of disorganization after the US leaves NATO, and would have allowed Russia to form a stronger bond with China to create their own ""NATO"".

""Russian special services are planning a series of terrorist attacks to blow up and blow up residential buildings, hospitals and schools in Russian settlements. As well as the launch of missile and bomb strikes on the city of Belgorod or one of the cities of Crimea, ""said in a comment to the press service of the agency the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major General Kirill Budanov.

He is convinced that the failure of Russia's mobilization plan is forcing the Putin regime to use dirty scenarios to emotionally stir up Russian society and consolidate it even more against Ukrainians. Ukraine and volunteer battalions to create an emotional picture of the ""atrocities of Ukrainian nationalists."" It is quite possible that these terrorist attacks will be presented as revenge of Ukrainians for Bucha and Kramatorsk and as a justification of cruelty against the Ukrainian civilian population, ""the head of the GUR emphasized.

""In recent days, the Russian government has been increasingly dispersing the flywheel of anti-Ukrainian hysteria. Trenches are being actively dug in Belgorod and Kursk oblasts, and panic is flaring up over the imaginary offensive of Ukrainian volunteer battalions and sabotage groups, ”Budanov added. In his opinion, it is very symbolic that Putin's rule began with hebezh terrorist attacks against Russian apartment buildings, which became the basis for the destruction of Chechnya. And now, it seems, it ends with the same methods""

The size and scale of use would play a role in how to assess.  
  
8 mile long convoy is now 60km north of Izium, has a partial goal of resupplying the front. Heavy fighting to the south of Izium, which officials believe could be used by Russia to stage a broader attack on larger cities to the south.  
  
Significant number of Switchblade drones are already delivered, official will not offer assessment as to whether they have been used.  
  
Almost the entirety of a $800M tranche of defense aid has been delivered (19 of 20 planes), while another tranche of $100M is almost entirely delivered as well.

Basically I’ve been going through a lot of the twitter threads of the VDV and other Russian soldiers that have died and many of them look somewhat Asian or maybe half Asian? I’ve noticed this a lot to with videos of even regular russian soldiers that look very Asian or eastern.

Now interestingly all the videos of Ukrainian forces I’ve seen look very much European and similar to say Germans or French. As someone who has stayed in France for long periods of time I can say that I wouldn’t be able to distinguish between a Ukrainian and a French person just on looks.

I would have thought Russians and Ukrainians were both white but do Russians have part Asian or middle eastern? I’m honestly just curious because I didn’t expect Russians and Ukrainians to look different but they seemingly do to a degree?

Bandera and his ilk did to Jews & Polish people what Russia did to Bucha, and called for the eradication of Jews. In light of that, I wonder - aren't there better figures in Ukraine's history who also fought against the Soviets for Ukraine? Why does that bother people in the East of Ukraine so little that they still hold parades in his honor?

It may be hard to have a critical view of someone who fought for your country against the Soviets... but I firmly believe no fascists deserve to be honored. Not the ones in Germany's past, not the ones from present day Russia, and not the ones in Ukraine's past either.

I hope when this is over, Zelenskyy will be able to use his well-deserved hero-status to encourage a more critical view. I am confident his heritage and belief (from all I've seen and read) in liberty and equality makes him more sensitive to (and sensible on) these issues.

EDIT: Ah, the good old reddit hivemind... voice some sincere criticism in a post where you make it a point to say that you condemn Russia's genocidal war and that their citing these issues is a cynical ploy (which shouldn't mean that sincere and warranted criticism should be silenced) - still get downvoted to hell and accused of ""muddying the waters"" (when it's actually Melnyk doing that)...

Now considering Psaki has outright [admitted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/11/inflation-data-white-house-expects-big-price-hikes-in-march-cpi-report.html) that inflation is going to be staggering I now know for a fact I was right. Inflation was high before the energy ban, but the war and the decision to ban Russian oil and gas has greatly elevated it. The fed has to be careful in raising interest rates because accelerating rates will cause a recession so we have to endure high inflation for a while. 

Would inflation be high even without the ban? Sure, but like I said the ban really accelerated it. Because of the law of marginal utility of income Inflation and higher gas prices (because gas is such a demand inelastic product) hurts the poorest of the country the most. 

Joe Biden and Congress was not elected by the people of Kyiv, Odessa, or Kharkiv they were elected by the people of Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. They took an oath to serve **America** not Ukraine so why did they prioritize the welfare of the Ukrainian people over the American people? 

This continues to baffle me. We’ve already spent over 5 trillion dollars to try and bring “freedom” to Iraq and Afghanistan and what has that gotten us? An Iraq that’s now closer to Iran than ever before and an Afghanistan that collapsed within weeks after we left. How many hospitals and schools could we have built? How many miles of rail and road could we have laid? How many of our children’s dreams could we have helped fulfill? 

The energy ban is just a long line of our politicians prioritizing people on the other side of the world rather than the vulnerable right here at home.

>My experiences with the Russian and Ukrainian armies over the two decades reminded me of a passage from Jean Larteguy’s The Centurions. In a moment of frustration, a French officer summarizes the two purposes an army can serve:

>*I’d like [France] to have two armies: one for display with lovely guns, tanks, little soldiers, staffs, distinguished and doddering Generals, and dear little regimental officers who would be deeply concerned over their General’s bowel movements or their Colonel’s piles, an army that would be shown for a modest fee on every fairground in the country. The other would be the real one, composed entirely of young enthusiasts in camouflage uniforms, who would not be put on display, but from whom impossible efforts would be demanded and to whom all sorts of tricks would be taught. That’s the army in which I should like to fight.*

This sub does not share any video/news from the other side unless it is something completely shocking. As a news source, we are not impartial. We are actively a Ukraine support group.

I ventured into Russian echo chamber and they have a LOT of stuff showing their 'wins'. Just like not everything posted here is 100% accurate, same goes for them. But it is enough for anyone on Russia's side to believe things are going great. 

Yesterday a video surfaced here of a tank blowing up soldiers at point blank range. It was initially posted as Ukraine tank blowing up Russian soldiers and there were people joking that Russian soldiers are dumb as they couldn't even tell a tank was approaching them. Turns out it was actually Ukrainian soldiers being blown up by Russian tank. When reposted, I remember somebody told OP to not post it. 

Point is that the war is very volatile right now and Ukraine is taking more hits than you think. Don't get yourself in this false sense of security.

“Vladimir, good day! I hoped that it would not come to this, but no ... I have to ask you to warn about the already quite specific terrorist risks for civilian infrastructure in Russia.
What has changed: in Russia (in general, unevenly from region to region), instead of a decline in vandalism in relation to the V and Z symbols on cars / buildings, there is an increasing trend. So that you understand, the level of counteraction to this has already reached the maximum capabilities of all departments, investigations are being conducted as in especially serious cases, no one spares effort and means, measures of influence go beyond the legal ones (harsh detentions, torture). 
There is a desire (or a need - this is already a verbal balancing act of the authorities) to bring counteraction to such vandalism to the level of ""counterterrorism"". The service was involved in this in full, although formally it is not even our jurisdiction. And now we need to, so to speak, ""fix the agenda.""
Under the control of one of the departments of the Service, the application of V and Z symbols has begun on (if possible, detached) residential buildings in regions with a particularly high level of ""symbolic vandalism"". The border areas in the Crimea and Belgorod go separately - they will make special emphasis there. It is precisely on these objects that supposedly sabotage strikes can be inflicted (although I am inclined to consider this direct terrorism) in order to increase the level of terrorist threat, readiness for covert mobilization (mass contracting with conscripts and reservists), etc. 
No one will inform our colleagues on the ground, I can't predict the level of planned damage and the presence of victims. But such actions (terrorist attacks and hundreds of civilian casualties) will be able to provoke such processes that will go beyond any forecasts of the authors of this approach.
I ask you to pay attention to all detached residential facilities and especially high-rise buildings in the regions of Russia, primarily in the border areas of the Belgorod region, as well as in the Crimea, on which V and Z markings have already been placed (will be placed in the coming days): by this objects require increased attention in terms of state security. 

Guys from the regional FSB! All responsibility will be transferred not only to the mythical ""internal enemies"", but also to you! None of us needs any acts of demonstrative intimidation, much less explosions of residential buildings with people inside.
If this scenario is implemented now, then completely insane processes will start for everyone.
This warning may be a direct reason for residents of such houses to appeal to the regional departments of the FSB with a demand for enhanced control over the security of these facilities.""",False,1649760996.0,t3_u1q7bg,t1_i4eui10,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

They didn't take it, and instead, let their population of highly trained and educated professionals, grow to become what would have been the world's envy.  Because; while the Soviets invested heavily in propagandized education, they also taught their kids math and science and different languages. They allowed that to die on the vine.

The reason why electric vehicle didn't take off back then was due to the lack of infrastructure, reliability and distance. Those 3 main areas have been resolved or are continuing to be solved today and thus electric vehicles are now a marketable thing (it also helps when you're trip to the pump is $50/month so advertising a car that can cost $5/month for it's fuel is kinda of a no-brainer really).

 >The Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits, often known simply as the Montreux Convention, is an international agreement governing the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits in Turkey. Signed on 20 July 1936 at the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, it went into effect on 9 November 1936, addressing the long running Straits Question over who should control the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean Seas. The Montreux Convention regulates maritime traffic through the Black Sea.

For one, it would be more accurate to talk about the post-Stalinist Soviet system rather than 'communism'.  None of Russia's economic changes in the 90s up to and including this past month represents a reversion of economic policy.  So you're equating communism not with its economy, which is all it means, but with infamous Soviet suppression of speech, movement, etc.  

There are as many different flavors of communism as there are for capitalism, if not more.  Biden, Warren, Trump, Bush, Sanders, Orban, Johnson, Scholz, Merkel, idk Rand Paul for example, would agree with each other on maybe 15% of all issues at best, and probably not even, and yet they're all capitalists.  But communists get painted with this wide brush that suggests they're all alike; it's ignorance.  

Stalin had nothing to do with the space program.  He didn't care about it.  In fact his purges held it back two decades.  Sergei Korolev (a Ukrainian) was alternately in a gulag and house arrest right up until Stalin died, at which point Khrushchev recruited him to launch the 'space race'.  This was part of the so-called 'Khrushchev thaw' that sought to undo Stalinist policy.  

Economically speaking, the big difference between communism and capitalism is communism works best in a vacuum, where all resources are within your borders and there is no international competition interfering with their value, while capitalism requires winners and losers and uses market tools to acquire resources from other countries at gain and therefore can't exist in a vacuum.  This is part of the importance of the doctrine of permanent revolution, so that there are no resources outside the system.  Stalin and other 'third-way' communists shunned this doctrine and were content to focus on interdependent socialist polities.  Russia may be isolating itself from the world, but that just means it only has access to its own resources.  Its network of 'friendly states' doesn't come close to the interdependency that allowed Sovietism to limp along for 70 years.  Further it's coming at a time when globalism and the information age virtually mandates freer exchanges of goods as well as services.  Only a global capitalist network or a global communist system can sustain itself; anything in-between is self-isolating and internally destructive now more than ever.  

Putin may well admire Stalin, but he has as little interest in ideology as Stalin did, and any policies he's pursuing superficially similar to Stalin's are occurring in a world that couldn't support those policies today.

In a different world he would have been able to travel to England and grab a beer at Wembley and watch them beat Arsenal 4-0. He would have met some English guys and they’d have had convos about life in Moscow or St Petersburg. Maybe they keep in contact and they are able to travel there and rent an Airbnb where they visit the red square and eat pierogies. 

Yeah nah. He made choices and got exactly what he deserved. His death isn't a cause for sadness, it's justice.

The issue isn't whether Russian soldiers are real people with real lives, families and personalities. Of course they are. Behind every russian dead body there's going to be a similar mixture of good, bad, hopes, dreams and aspirations. That's just humanity.

But whatever they were before, they have undertaken a completely unprovoked assault on their neighbours, murdered thousands, looted everything and brutally raped children. If he didn't do those things himself, he certainly helped make them possible. One of the hardest things to understand is how people who commit atrocities can go home at the end of the day, play with their dog, kiss their wife, read a story to their kids and put them to bed, but they can. It doesn't make them any less reprehensible, its just something humans are pretty good at doing when they disassociate their evil from their family life.

Real answers:

Bucha:  

Two things were in play:

1)  Russians became scared and started ""cleansing"" anyone who may be a threat.  That's how you get executions of prertty much malws males of military age.

2)  lack of discipline  lead to cases of rape and theft, which was covered up by murder of victims and witnesses.   The cases of (2) were emboldened due to execution occurring under cases (1).  Much easier to diffuse blame when lots of peope are getting shot.  It becomes normalized.

An outgrowth of Soviet propaganda techniques, the firehose of falsehood is a contemporary model for Russian propaganda under Russian President Vladimir Putin.

>The Russian government used the technique during its offensive against Georgia in 2008, and continued to use it in the Russia's conflict with Ukraine, including successfully using in 2014 during the annexation of Crimea, and attempting to use it during the prelude to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The model has been adopted by other governments and political movements around the world, including by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

So first of all it is good to know what is going on with Ukrainian politics and president - currently we are Parliament - President country, so on paper President should be responsible only for defence and foreign policy, all other things is responsibility of parliament.
But in fact a lot of presidents had its own party and lobby groups that pushed its own interests in internal policy and laws, economy and so on. Also it is psychologically more suitable for regular voter to blame all bad things to President, as it is hard to blame group of people from which party consists of. So that allows some parliament members using people with short memory and not so political involvement to switch ideas and stay at power for long time. 
It is explained with simple statement that we are really young democracy, with lot of influence and old politics from soviet era, its elites.

So here we are at second point - as all of media is not commercial enough and controlled by oligarchs and elites, this is hard enough in steady developing country, when reforms may be seen in years to convince that current man and party in power is doing right things.
Also consider factor of destabilisation from external foes(Russia) internal political parties that control media and here we go. 

Each president is blamed of all bad things.
On a good sign, this means that we do not allow one party to stay for to long in power.

The issue isn't whether they can build more, but how long it will take to get their production lines up and running at full steam and whether another country like Iran or North Korea will try something crazy in the meantime (which they might given that their patron Russia is revealing itself to be far weaker than anyone believed).",False,1649812305.0,t3_u1q7bg,t1_i4i5prn,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

The usage of tear gas in war is *not* because it's a chemical ""weapon"" per se, but, because it's easily *mistaken* for lethal chemical weapons.  If the other side brings up chemical troops, their soldiers all start donning NBC gear, and then puffs of chemical gas appear during an artillery barrage and your troops are falling sick...welp, they're using gas, time to counter with gas, load up the sarin shells!

Partly because the escalation in 1914-1915 was tear gas -> chlorine -> mustard gas & worse (when only ""irritant"" chemicals were legal to use in warfare, but ""poisons"" were not), every nation decided it was just too much of a risk.

As a side note: this critical link is also why *all* NBC weapon use is so taboo and unlikely, with the exception of small-scale chemical weapons use.

B.  No one will pay market price for Russian gas now.  Price is set by supply and demand.  If the largest countries in the world don’t buy it, that means those that are left have a massive amount of leverage and they will squeeze Russia for a better deal, and they have to.

USA CRAMs are expensive, yes, but they were showing off their prowness as recently as the Afghanistan withdrawal. ISIS launched a bunch of rockets at the airport, and none of them hit. If 500mph rockets can't hit the airport, why do you think a drone would work?

> 7000 javelins - it might be better to supplement the remaining javelins with anti-tank drones instead.

Javelins have night-vision, thermal-vision, 3-mile range and 500mph fly speeds. They also lock on and are ""fire-and-forget"".

Drones gotta be piloted to reach their destination, which already means electronic-warfare could jam the signal before they reach their target. (The Ukrainian missile doesn't have this problem because that's a simple laser-following missile, the Russians would have to kill the laser to stop the guidance).

You can't command a drone if the airwaves are jammed up. Javelin / NLAW is 100% autonomous without any radio, hardened against radio-interference by simply not using a radio at all.",1649805280.0,1649805054.0,t3_u1q7bg,t1_i4hoqya,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

 >A war of annihilation (German: Vernichtungskrieg) or war of extermination is a type of war in which the goal is the complete annihilation of a state, a people or an ethnic minority through genocide or through the destruction of their livelihood. The goal can be outward-directed or inward, against elements of one's own population. The goal is not like other types of warfare, the recognition of limited political goals, such as recognition of a legal status (such as in a war of independence), control of disputed territory (as in war of aggression or defensive war), or the total military defeat of an enemy state.

Wilm Hosenfeld. 


Originally a school teacher, was a German Army officer who by the end of the Second World War had risen to the rank of Hauptmann (Captain). He helped to hide or rescue several Polish people, including Jews, in Nazi-German occupied Poland, and helped Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman to survive, hidden, in the ruins of Warsaw during the last months of 1944, an act which was portrayed in the 2002 film The Pianist. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and died in Soviet captivity in 1952.

In October 2007, Hosenfeld was posthumously honoured by the president of Poland Lech Kaczyński with a Commander’s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. In June 2009, Hosenfeld was posthumously recognized in Yad Vashem (Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust) as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

(don't get me wrong, I doubt Russia will escalate to nuclear, but that's because of the political cost in relations with neutrals, not out of concern for a NATO response).

Finally, your assessment of a full nuclear war between NATO and Russia, should we consider it for the sake of argument, is also slightly misguided.

Australia is not real. It’s a hoax, made for us to believe that Britain moved over their criminals to someplace. In reality, all these criminals were loaded off the ships into the waters, drowning before they could see land ever again. It’s a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires.
Australia does not exist. All things you call “proof” are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the leading governments of the world. Your Australian friends? They’re all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.
If you think you’ve ever been to Australia, you’re terribly wrong. The plane pilots are all in on this, and have in all actuality only flown you to islands close nearby – or in some cases, parts of South America, where they have cleared space and hired actors to act out as real Australians.
Australia is one of the biggest hoaxes ever created, and you have all been tricked. Join the movement today, and make it known that they have been deceived. Make it known, that this has all just been a cover-up. The things these “Australian” says to be doing, all these swear words and actions based on alcoholism, MDMA and bad decisions, are all ways to distract you from the ugly truth that is one of the greatest genocides in history. 162,000 people was said to have been transported to this imaginary land during a mere 80 years, and they are all long dead by now. They never reached that promised land.
Tell the truth. Stand up for what is right. Make sure to spread the world – Australia is not real. It’s a codeword for the cold blooded murder of more than a hundred thousand people, and it is not okay. We will not, accept this.

I don't like Steinmeier personally, hoped they would vote an independent as president. He was the right hand of Schröder, who did NordStream2. I still think its a bad act diplomatically atleast of Ukraine, no matter the person it's still the one person that represents Germany as a whole in this role and he apologized that the old politics of them didn't work out and were wrong, some days ago. 20 years ago many would have said Russia is on a good way out of their Soviet behaviour, only later you realized they kinda stayed the same. And I think there is a lot of misconception and prejudice in media and on reddit about what Germany actually does to help Ukraine, especially if you compare them with other EU countries and their foreign politics of the last decades. It's easy to distract with Germany, it happens very often in EU politics tbh, its the one thing many countries like to point towards when they need a scapegoat.

An example: I remember when Italy was hit first time big with Covid and Germany send medical aid and flew persons out to their hospital with military med helicopter, China send a few (later turned out fake/low quality) protection masks. Populistic Italian politics tried to blame 'Nazi Germany' for not doing enough and praised China on who they can rely on. People say what gets them votes.

A lot of his rating were lost due to current media state, as a lot of it is controlled by big financial groups that made their capital in not so ""white and clear"" way.

So personally he isn't corrupt, care for a country and also politic with human face and values, that is not common to see in any politics, not only Ukrainian.

 >Wilhelm Adalbert Hosenfeld (German pronunciation: [ˈvɪlm ˈhoːzənfɛlt]; 2 May 1895 – 13 August 1952), originally a school teacher, was a German Army officer who by the end of the Second World War had risen to the rank of Hauptmann (Captain). He helped to hide or rescue several Polish people, including Jews, in Nazi-German occupied Poland, and helped Jewish pianist and composer Władysław Szpilman to survive, hidden, in the ruins of Warsaw during the last months of 1944, an act which was portrayed in the 2002 film The Pianist. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and died in Soviet captivity in 1952.

 >Russification (Russian: Русификация, romanized: Rusifikatsiya), or Russianization, is a form of cultural assimilation in which non-Russians, whether involuntarily or voluntarily, give up their culture and language in favor of the Russian culture and the Russian language. In a historical sense, the term refers to both official and unofficial policies of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union with respect to their national constituents and to national minorities in Russia, aimed at Russian domination and hegemony. The major areas of Russification are politics and culture.

The USSR didn't fight Germany until Germany attacked them. Otherwise they would have stayed out. 

France and the UK didn't get involved until an ally they had a treaty with, Poland, was attacked. 

Likewise, the US did not enter the war until attacked. 

The allies in WWII resisted Hitler when attacked or when legal obligations demanded. Not before. It wasn't about suffering.

>Pretending that NATO's reticence to get involved here has anything has to do with international law is utter bunk.

Just because you don't take international law seriously doesn't mean the people who devote their lives to international politics don't. It matters to them, even if it doesn't to you. 

That's why the US is dead set on defending ""every inch"" of NATO territory and not stepping one toe into non-NATO territory. It isn't primarily about fear. If it was, US wouldn't be willing to defend the Baltics if it meant war with Russia. The US is willing to risk war with Russia, nukes and all, to defend those it has a legal obligation to, not those who it doesn't. That means fear isn't the only reason for not getting involved.

>No such mandate is necessary in this case. Ukraine are inviting, nay begging, allies to assist in its defence. It is perfectly legal for countries to do so, with or without UNSC mandate.

Countries may do so. NATO may not. If Poland wants to send their troops into Ukraine, that's Poland, not NATO.

The proletariat are those who work to build a modern society: factory workers, railroad/road workers, mine workers, all kinds of industry workers. ""The working class.""

Implies that ""industrial"" workers in all locations need to organize and form committees that self-rule factories, and form ""communes"" that cooperate.

In theory, it distributes wealth for the good of ""the masses"" (not including the majority of the population that is farmers and land workers), where leaders shan't have much more than the rest. Ideally, private ownership is bad.

In another theory, this principle is so marvellous that it will be copied in all countries all over the world.

 Anyway, with Russia it is always the Western borders.

Most of the population is in a part of Europe that has lousy natural fortifications, and a more or less straight line between Berlin and Moscow, with the sheer amount of land being the only real defence.

From the West only, there have been invasions from France, Germany twice, Poland multiple times, Sweden tried it, the Teutonic Knights, hell even the UK had a presence in Russia at one point.

Russia gets invaded again and again from Europe, and it is always the same old thing where Russia takes incredible amounts of damage before the enemy becomes exhausted and either retreats or dies.

So Russia always tries to control the surrounding area, by trying to control everything between Moscow and the Carpathian mountains, while using the Great Northern Plain as a buffer between Moscow and everybody else.

It is just, that presumes that the west is out to get you, just like the past, and ignores that not only do we have our own problems, an invasion of Russia is too costly, gives us nothing that we want, is incredibly illegal, and would likely end in nuclear fire.

It reminded him of Afghanistan in the 1990s, after Soviet forces withdrew and the U.S. failed to fill the security vacuum. “Pretty soon the extremists took over. The Taliban was in charge. And we did not wake up until 9/11,” Soufan tells TIME. “This is the parallel now with Ukraine.”

You don't know, but fear, and of course I don't know anything. But I suspect Finland would hand whatever BTGs Russia can scrape together their asses.  And, in addition, this would accelerate Finland's acceptance into NATO, to ""ensconce"" Putin's 4D ""strategeric excellence"" forever. Don't fuck with the Finns.

If Russia moves troops to Finland's border,  that ""brilliant"" strategeric move would open up 500 miles of a front on Russias's far western flank. 500 miles.  Putin and russia can't control their Ukrainian fronts.   That's a fucking genius strategery move on Putin's part given that a) his supposed goal was to REDUCE NATO on his flanks, b) Finland's air and other capabilities are quite high.

If Putin threatens Finland with significant BTG battle ready groups, he is even higher on meth than this Ukraine invasion has suggested he is.  He is Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.

I'm sorry, your fears about Finland are while perhaps well-intended, bullshit.  And if so, Finland will go to NATO, with Sweden, their partner, along with them, which would be just a coup de grace on Putin's strategery part, wouldn't it (if you think about it.)?

3rd generation American Swede-Finn here. As my great grandfather used to sjoke, in the Winter War, the Finns came in a close second. After exhausting 1/3 to 1/2 of their offensive capabilities on Ukraine, Putin would prove himself to be smoking meth to invade Finland, never mind put enough offensive capabilities on their 500 mile border to ""threaten"" Finland.  I hope Putin is exactly that stupid. And who knows, he might be ssniffing his own farts enough to be that stupid, but I doubt it after his BTGs got their asses handed to them in Northern Ukraine.

Because it was intentional, don't forget Germany was based on dumb ideological policies. So Hitler didn't want to have war at the ""home front"", so they didn't enter war economy until 1943 or something, at a point when it was too late anyways.

And many of their war decisions were based on ideologies or Hitler's stupidity, rather than military strategy. For instance, Hitler wanted big ships instead of a huge submarine fleet (contrary to Doenitz advice), and those ships were obviously fucking useless vs planes. Then he wanted big ass tanks (altough, those were actually not bad) and other stupid shit that also hurt streamlined production.

But if you look at WW1, when they were less ideological, they went for war economy much earlier. 

And other strategic dumbassery is for instance, Ukraine could have been an ally vs Russia, but because Himmler was a piece of shit he would rather waste resources on massacring civilains and jews etc.



So my point is that, strategically Germany was fucking dogshit in WW2. But on the tactical level and using the army with the stuff they had available, they were very competent.",1649790805.0,1649790551.0,t3_u1q7bg,t1_i4grpxn,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

I agree with you that it is paranoia that is making them take this belief so strongly but I would also argue it is malicious in nature. They want to feel geopolitically untouchable so that they can then pursue their interests freely with no hope for the EU or the US to cause any actual harm to Russia. It is at least clear they don’t want to let Europe fall to American influence and believed they were doing a great job with that with the EU’s energy dependency, Brexit (as they view the UK an extension of the US) and reemergence of isolationism in the US. They wanted to make the EU the buffer between the US and the great Russian power. From Lisbon to Vladivostok as Medvedev recently (and quite foolishly) revealed recently.

Now what is the drive for such passion for world domination? I have no idea, nationalism perhaps and this could be the result of growing in the USSR during the Cold War. What is quite fascinating however is how closely the Russian leadership and elite adhere to these geopolitical goals. They are essentially all letting out quotes from the same series of books. From Putin’s famous Munich speech in 09 about a multipolar world, to Medvedev’s Eurasia quote to Lavrov’s quote about the invasion challenging US hegemony.

I think it would be of paramount importance to the West to understand that these people have a step by step guide on world domination and to deconstruct it.

NATO is now shooting down Russian aircraft and you've started WW3 and potentially nuclear war. Billions are dead, and the rest will likely die in the following nuclear winter.

Possible - but not soon as Russia has spent many resources on this war, and the next is likely to be bloodier as countries won't be caught as unaware. While Russia licks its wounds, countries can, and are, joining NATO.

> Standing back and letting that happen betrays everything we fought and died for during ww2.

WW2 was different as nuclear weapons didn't exist. The modern world is one button away from disaster, it's simply a different landscape.
