Understand that propaganda **can be true**. There are concerted efforts to make the word ""propaganda"" the new ""fake news."" A story that is completely true, when presented in a way designed to drum up Ukranian sympathy, is STILL propaganda...

And the pro-Russian nationalists would have you believe that this propaganda is to be discredited from news as readily as any propaganda based completely on falsehoods.

If someone discredits something for being propaganda, acknowledge it, and assess the truth facts and value of the propaganda **outside** its propagandist nature. Do not let them steer the discourse toward ""it's propaganda, so this subject will not be discussed.""

It is 9:07 pm in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now:

The Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has come under more heavy shelling as Russian forces step up their offensive and move forces closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it.

Russian paratroopers landed in Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, following several days of bombardment that has killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Four more people died on Wednesday, local authorities said, adding the city was still under their control.

Authorities in the strategically important southern city of Kherson on the Black Sea have denied Russia’s claims that its forces have captured what would be their first large city of the invasion, saying only the port and train station have fallen.

The strategically important Sea of Azov port city of Mariupol is also reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said.

More than 350 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured, according to Ukraine’s emergency service. Hundreds of structures including transport facilities, hospitals, kindergartens and homes have been destroyed, it said.

Ukraine claimed nearly 7,000 Russian troops had been killed in the first six days of Moscow’s invasion and the Kremlin would not take his country with bombs and airstrikes.

Russia’s defence ministry said 498 Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since the start of its campaign,
its first statement on casualties.

The UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against.

A second round of talks is reportedly to get under way on Thursday. A Russian negotiator said a ceasefire is on the agenda, but Ukraine has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing Ukrainian cities before any progress can be expected.

Police in Poland warned that fake reports of violent crimes being committed by people fleeing Ukraine are circulating on social media after Polish nationalists attacked and abused groups of African, south Asian and Middle Eastern people who had crossed the border last night.

But he said that Vladimir Putin's regime recognised the Ukrainian people's right to chose their own leader and that Russia accepts Volodymyr Zelensky as the legitimate president.

To the people who argued that Canada had nothing to do with the sanctions and did not play the most influential role in consensus building, in particular Chrystia Freeland, please enjoy [this incredible read](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/27/canada-russia-cash-freeze-freeland-00012139) on what Canada did to get the SWIFT ban moving, and seeding the idea of the sanctions of the Central Bank of Russia and others.

Canada has played a highly motivated and possibly the most economically devastating role in an attempt to deter the Russians. I might have *some* bias, but it's clear from repeated and discrete tellings of the story from multiple sources and personal anecdotes that Freeland (and Trudeau) might be the backbone of the sanctions that have hit Russia. In fact, [one particular anecdote expresses that Freeland was personally behind each and every single one of the sanctions levied against Russia](https://twitter.com/Heidi_Cuda/status/1498771506783944705?s=20&t=z3tjQeEVxLd9nTj1cmh7MQ).

> (Freeland) came up with the idea of cutting off Russia's Central Bank and their rainy day fund that was intended to be used as an economic buffer.

> “She was the one who circulated the theory among prominent Central Bankers in the Western world and fought for it.”Marty Sheil

In particular, Freeland's history with the USSR and Russia has made her persona non grata there. They absolutely hate her. Her mother was personally involved in writing Ukraine's constitution. Her studies took her aboard to Ukraine to study the language where the KGB took special notice to her due to her pro-democratic rhetoric that she shared. You can read more [here](https://i.redd.it/4nnky2cgsrk81.jpg) in where a 20-year-old Freeland was described as a 'well-known troublemaker' by Soviet authorities. [Further, she actually played a role in seeding the thought of Ukrainian independence while she was there](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-kgb-archives-show-how-chrystia-freeland-drew-the-ire-and-respect-of/).

> Ms. Freeland’s ties to Ukraine are no secret, but materials uncovered from the KGB archives in Kyiv illuminate her role in the Ukrainian independence movement while on exchange there from Harvard University.

And they absolutely respected her anyway.

> The conclusion is inescapable: Chrystia Freeland, this KGB officer was saying, would have made an excellent spy herself.

She's currently banned from Russia, and [has been personally sanctioned already by the Kremlin](https://globalnews.ca/news/3177689/why-canadas-top-diplomat-chrystia-freeland-banned-from-russia/). We're talking about a single woman, who has angered Russians with her democratic beliefs so much, that they still respected her enough to sanction her anyway. They are absolutely terrified of her.

> But Freeland hasn't been allowed to set foot there for almost three years since she was among the 13 Canadians placed on a sanctions list as part of Putin’s retaliatory measures to Western sanctions.

The [Kremlin even tried to smear her](https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/glavin-how-the-russians-tried-to-smear-chrystia-freeland) when she ascended to her first political role as Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister.

> 
> Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s ambitious foreign affairs minister, is secretly itching to draw Canada into a showdown with Russia because of the seething hatreds she inherited from her Ukrainian grandfather, a Nazi collaborator and war profiteer she never told us about. She’s been lying about her family’s sordid past all along, and she’s been lying to Canadians about what’s really going on in Ukraine. She’s dangerous.

> The main problem with all this is that it’s rubbish, from top to bottom. It’s also the hottest political news story in Canada right now.

> The story started making the rounds in obscure Kremlin-friendly web sites within days after Freeland was sworn in as minister of foreign affairs in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Jan. 10 cabinet shuffle. The story got some traction in the netherworld of far-right and “anti-imperialist” North American webzines and in a couple of Polish magazines. Then it more or less trailed off.

And she shrugged it off. And waited. 

Indeed, this is more than just petty revenge. This is /r/ProRevenge material. She waited until the opportunity struck and absolutely nailed Russia's balls to the wall by convincing the entirety of the European Union to move forward with the sanctions on the Central Bank of Russia and have them banned from SWIFT. 

I'll leave you with[ these lines](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/canada-preparing-third-shipment-of-lethal-equipment-for-ukraine-to-be-routed-through-poland) she recently said in a conference when Canada announced their sanctions on Russia:

In an emergency session of the UN’s general assembly, 141 of the 193 member states voted for the resolution, 35 abstained and five voted against.

The resolution, which was co-sponsored by 94 countries, said the UN “deplores in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine”. It demanded that “the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine” and “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces”.

The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus.

On Friday, Russia was the sole vote against a similar resolution in the security council, but because Russia is one of the five powers with a veto, the resolution was not upheld, so Ukraine’s allies referred the matter to the general assembly.

It is first time in 40 years, the security council has referred a crisis to the assembly and only the 11th time an emergency session of the UN general assembly has been called since 1950.

**Tactical breakdown of the current situation in Ukraine**

The Russian army attempted a blitzkrieg (lightning war) that slowly turned into a badly planned siege. This is because a blitzkrieg requires fast moving divisions to move rapidly into the war zone one after another in quick succession. This didn’t happen because of [Rasputitsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputitsa) aka Mud General which is thick mud and marsh like conditions caused by the poor drainage of underlying clay-laden soils found in this region.  Because of this Russia was forced to keep all of their equipment on roads leading to the 40 mile pileup we see now. The high temperatures (above freezing during the day) causing this are likely to continue for at least the next few weeks. This “caravan” is less of a threat and more of a display of Putins failures.

The most difficult part of these sort of maneuvers is logistics. Heck, the majority of “the art of war” is about logistics behind feeding and supplying an army. Putin is not much of a war general, with essentially no experience at it. He kept all of his plans a secret even from his own generals, which meant that they were never prepared for what he had in mind (or possibly just decided impulsively). They were probably even burning precious fuel and munitions during the fake training exercises.

To supply an army you have to build your own Amazon.com level logistics or have your men live off the land via stolen food/fuel/munitions which is not an option here. They’re stuck on a single road in many cases and have no way to supply the front of the caravan. Supplying them with air transport will also be essentially impossible.

At this point the most likely scenario is that yes, eventually Russia will take key cities like Kyiv. But this will mean very little. Because of their desperate tactics and brutality, they’ve only strengthened the resolve of Ukraine and the rest of the free world. Like the saying (likely incorrectly) attributed to Yamamoto after Pearl Harbor “I fear we have awakened a sleeping giant and filled it with a terrible resolve” in reference to U.S. war industry, it now applies well to Ukraine’s supply of financing, manpower and weaponry. Further, Russia can no longer even produce munitions due to supply shortages caused by sanctions.

Much of the equipment Russia is sending is on a one way trip. Very soon it will be without fuel or ammunition, let alone food to feed its troops.

Eventually the Russians will have to turn tail and run, leaving behind all of this equipment. It will become something of a self-fulfilling prophecy for Putin in that Ukraine will suddenly have a very impressive amount of equipment and be a member of the EU which is like backdoor membership to NATO. He has single-handedly created the enemy he was previously only pretending existed.

From there we’re likely to enter into a very high tension Cold War with Russia as Putin escalates his nuclear threats out of fear and desperation. The likelihood of him even being able to launch a significant number of these weapons is only going to decrease over time as Russia devolves into bankruptcy and runaway inflation.

Aside from Putin launching these weapons, one of the biggest threats will be the possible sale and proliferation of Russian nuclear weapons to other countries as their economy and military eventually break down. Even the engineers and scientists themselves who work on these weapons are a threat as they sell their services to other bidders. This is in fact exactly how North Korea obtained nuclear technology.",1646242582.0,1646241763.0,t3_t5529v,t3_t5529v,,0,77,0,77,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

The billionaires Hansjörg Wyss and Todd Boehly are part of a consortium trying to buy the Premier League team.

Sources have said at least one other group is preparing to make an offer this week. There is a sense that a bidding war would help Abramovich maintain some form of leverage and the first move came when Wyss, a Swiss businessman, revealed that he had been invited to join a consortium aiming to own Chelsea.

Abramovich confirmed his plans to sell in a statement on Wednesday evening and said net proceeds from the sale would be donated to a charitable foundation which would be “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”. He said he would not be asking for the money he has loaned Chelsea since buying the club in 2003 to be repaid.

Abramovich said:

I have always taken decisions with the club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club’s sponsors and partners.

Yesterday I started writing a big text about the main questions tormenting the minds of most educated Russians from 20 to 50 years old now. Why is this happening? Who is behind this (except Putin, of course)? Why do those who have huge capitals now find themselves speechless and powerless, as well as the majority of the poor and uneducated population? What should those young men do, the one who can be mobilized and sent to the front, without the right to choose, for fighting in the war they do not want? How to stop it? How to escape from this military terror, where every day is getting scarier than the previous one?

Speaking about the origins of what is happening, most of the analysts and political historians I know (I am a professional historian, so  now trying in vain to understand what is happening) agree in a single thought about the causes of this war. Of course, Nazi, the children of Donbass and the hidden threat of Nato have little to do with these answers.It is very important to understand that after the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia was de facto captured by two key groupings: financial (economic/capitalist and military), which set the rules of the game and somehow balanced the last 30 years. These groups have nothing to do with the concept of a political party (we have essentially no parties, only nominal associations that do not have real political will and power).

It would be naive to think that the capitalist group is represented only by oligarchs, and the military is represented only by professional developers of weapons and militarists - in fact, all this time in each of the groups there were people lobbying for the interests of another group, if I may say so. For almost all of the 2000s, Putin, who was younger and much more adequate then, coped quite successfully with the role of evil mediator - he allowed capitalists to privatize national resources like oil wells and coal deposits, and allowed the military from time to time to arrange and participate in ""small"" (sorry for this word - it's cruel) wars like Afghan Chechnya, Syria, the suppression of multiple uprisings in neighboring republics and in his own country).

As a matter of fact, all these guys in power were quite happy until 2011 (some optimists until 2014) - the balance was maintained, they all got richer, the population also lived much better than now (but still poor) then the last 5 years. In 2011, the order began to change: capitalists accustomed to living with 2-3 passports and acquainted with the very concept of Western democracy decided that the very fact that we have in fact one specific political force at the helm for 11 years is not ok.

Bolotnaya Square happened, Many guys in the west underestimate the consequences of Bolotnaya, but it was at that moment that the largest number of people believed that power could be changed without bloody sacrifices, in a normal legitimate way. Of course, this did not happen.Wealthy middle class that took to the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg was almost completely crushed. Not because everyone was taken at once and sent to prison, it wasn't there yet. It's just that private businesses that used to be relatively independent have started to be privatized by state corporations without a will. Top managers and just wealthy people who were seen during the protests were forced to quit their jobs, sell companies, flee Russia, immigrate. The garrote began to tighten.

The situation escalated every year: there were fewer and fewer options to survive independently, have appeared people who sold themselves to the state to save their families, their way of life - there were more and more such people. The protests are getting bloodier, there are more and more people in prisons: those who get there for political reasons often end up in the same cells with real criminals: murderers, rapists, drug dealers, which certainly demotivates the anti-Putin movement.Twelve years ago, the art group ""Voina"" held a political art action and painted a giant penis on the Liteyny Bridge in St. Petersburg. The bridge was movable and was raised every evening for the free passage of ships under it, so the penis literally ""stood up"" right in front of the FSB headquarters building in St. Petersburg. Already in 2015, such actions seemed to be unprecedented freedom of speech. Now it seems that it was in a fundamentally different universe.

Covid19 has changed Russia very much and brought a lot of fundamentally new developments to the Russian economy and politics. People in the 2010s joking about the reconstruction of the USSR, summer holidays in Sochi and the Iron Curtain really faced the Iron Curtain, caused not so much by political as by epidemiological reasons. Of course, people endured: the whole world endured this collapse and tried to cope and survive. The authorities realized that it was possible to limit the outflow of Russian money abroad, impose an unimaginable amount of tribute on the country in the form of taxes and contributions, increase the retirement age, take advantage of the moment and simply rewrite the constitution to suit their needs - they cared about survival, the issue of solving the problem of the authorities was postponed. Moscow was still protesting against what was happening, but in small towns the voice of protest was slowly subsiding: almost all the leaders of the anti-Putin movements were either killed or imprisoned, and protest, as you know, should always have a hero for whom the whole people are fightingc.

At the same time, capitalists who have made friends with government officials are getting richer. Independent experts estimate that only in first half 2020, about $1.5-2 billion went into the pockets of those who ""solved the covid issue"" by bribes. The military lobbies, as you may have guessed, had ""conditionally"" hard times - active military campaigns in foreign regions were temporarily stopped or stopped, weapons received significantly lower subsidies than pharma, import substitution, the digital industry developing all these food/medicine/remote work deliveries. They begin to get nervous, because if a conditional capitalist or an oligarch sent abroad, having money and connections, can somehow set up a business there, make investments, create financial mechanisms, then it is quite difficult for a person who earned his millions from the Russian defense industry, often a classified state secret, and even having the status of ""not allowed to travel"" to adapt to the new reality. They begin to become more active gradually surrounding Putin, supporting, provoking in his head a long-existing psychosis about ""how great it would be to recreate the Soviet Union and return Russia to its imperial greatness,"" about the ""Western threat,"" about the ""unresolved issue of Donbass and the LPR.In the end, by the beginning of winter, it became obvious that some movements towards resolving the issue of the DPR and the LPR would be made, most analysts assumed the resumption of active diplomatic negotiations, perhaps some minor military conflict in the border region with the subsequent separation of part of the territories of the republics and the strengthening of the diplomatic lobby in international organizations, which should finally achieve at least partial recognition of the Crimea.And then literally in one or two days some big shit happened. The fact that it happened for people inside the country was quite obvious: we live in an authoritarian dictatorship (rapidly turning into a military one), and not in political satire, and the behavior of ""capitalistically lobbied"" and even not completely ""close"" to Putin people fully confirmed this theory. A speech by the Security Council at which some of the speakers were simply confused in their words and did not know what their leadership expected them to hear.The round eyes of the advisers, realizing that the words about the ""nuclear threat"" really sounded. A complete brain explosion from the very fact that HIS rhetoric really begins to coincide with Hitler's in 1939 in all these ""solutions to the issue"", ""we only hit military objects"", ""there will be no civilian casualties or they will be minimal."" Oligarchs who hysterically save their property and even try to intervene in this conflict on their own right during the fighting (salute to Abramovich, who rushed to negotiate with Kiev without official permission even before it became known which idiots both sides had chosen as ""diplomats who should agree and resolve the issue of World War III"").

The ruble has depreciated, the stock exchange has collapsed, the common people are terrified, but as you know, trauma and the experience of trauma consists of several stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. I believe that most of us are still at one of the first two stages. Most of us had families, acquaintances, friends and colleagues in Ukraine. Most of them sent mone to them until yesterday, when it turned into an act of high treason (20 years in prison). Most people have a hard time imagining what and how to say to those with whom we have been friends for so many years and have never thought about the possibility of such a ""solution to the issue""

In theory the entire idea of the UN existing is to wag fingers, so to speak, an a lot of people don't get that. The UN exists as a means for countries to hash things out diplomatically instead of going to war. It's part of a planned system of interdependency that makes not going to war more attractive than fighting. 

Thats the plan at least. It has no real power other than those its members decide to give it. 

So in a sense everything the UN does is ""for show"". Yes they do run some good NGOs that really do stuff, and that's part of the interdependency scheme. 

The fact is wars are destructive, expensive and just fuck stuff up. Working together and not breaking stuff makes wealth that the rich can then skim, so not going to war becomes more attractive unless you run an arms factory. And so that FWIW is better, and the rich generally call the shots, right?

> Definitely, but then it becomes a question of who are the arbiters of truth. Do we call anything we disagree with lies? What if something seems to be a lie but later turns out to be true? Do we also police lies that are pro our side?


I think it's important that we clarify whether we're talking about facts or truth. Two people can look at the same facts and come up with two different truths. Facts are objective, truth isn't. Truth must be *based* on facts though.


When someone says something that isn't based on facts then it by definition cannot be the truth. And it should be shut down.


*But* that doesn't mean that all conversations must be based on objective facts. Because some stuff just can't be proven either way. Especially when talking about a war. There's always going to be known unknowns. We have to decided based on the information we have at the time. Which is why we should rely on subject matter experts to help us. That's why sources are so important.


Somebody just saying ""Putin wants nuclear war!"" is spreading d/misinformation, because there's nothing to back up what they're saying. But somebody saying ""Putin wants nuclear war, this former US ambassador to Russia and expert on American-Russian relations explains it here,"" well that deserves more credence and could be considered a truth. The same as another expert in the same subject matter saying the exact opposite, sure one is actually a fact, but because we can't confirm it's fine to treat both as truths.

How long have you been following the crisis today(minutes? Hours?)? How about the past week?

What have you *not* done in your personal life by attending to this? It is a very important issue to follow, to be sure, but it is also mentally and emotionally taxing. If you’re overwhelmed emotionally, you won’t be at your best in participating here or in your personal life.

How do you feel in this moment? Are you tense? Anxious? Angry? Despairing at human cruelty? These are all valid reactions to what’s going on, but you need to take care of yourself, for your own benefit and to not fall into emotional reasoning on what’s going on. The *world* just voted to condemn Russia’s actions - you do not need to personally witness every new tragedy to be a responsible global citizen.

Have you ever considered meditation or hypnosis?

For those who haven’t, here’s a basic breathing exercise:

Sit or lay down in a comfortable position. Don’t focus on it being dignified - the only requirement is that you feel comfortable. Close your eyes.

Take a deep breath inward through your nose for five seconds. Focus on the feeling of drawing the air in - how does the breath feel in your nose? In your lungs? Can you feel your heart beat faster?

Follow this with a slow out-breath of ten seconds through your mouth. How does your body feel as you do this?

Repeat this breathing for at least a minute (conveniently four complete in and out breaths). If you can go longer, so much the better!

If you can or find it beneficial, imagine that you are drawing strength and peace into your body with each breath in, and purging your doubts, pains, fears, and anxieties as you breathe out. The world may not change as you do - but you can choose how you react to what’s going on in the world.

Note what’s going through your mind and why as you do this. Instead of clinging to individual thoughts, allow them to gently pass from your consciousness. They will be very insistent at first, but give them permission to go on your way. You’re aiming to sit with yourself without being fixated on any one thought. Mastering this takes years, so just aim to experience the process and admire that you are taking a tangible step in managing your emotions constructively. I respect you for doing so; it’s never easy taking those first steps.

Taking care of ourselves as we hold compassion and concern for others is key, and allows us collectively to do what needs to be done to make sure that the evil we’re seeing can be fought rightly and resist those who, with propaganda and malice, would see our resolve waver. They want you to fear, to doubt, to despair. Be brave and don’t let them defeat you when it matters most.",1646243312.0,1646242973.0,t3_t5529v,t3_t5529v,,0,16,0,16,1,0,

I know historically, Russia has strategically won many conflicts by valuing the lives of their own people even less than other countries have anticipated. It’s fucking heartbreaking. 

When I read about all these economic sanctions bringing Russia to its knees, I’m tempted to feel inspired by the strong world response.  

But then I remind myself that economic maneuvers *are*, in a way, violence, or at least lead to violence.  The Russian people will experience poverty, and with that comes reduced health outcomes, violence, and perhaps even civil war.  Russians will die as a result of these sanctions, period.

This is not to say the sanctions are not warranted.  I support Ukraine and am glad that countries are uniting against Putin’s actions.  But I do feel for the Russian people who will feel the effect of these sanctions as much as or more than Putin and the oligarchs.  In fact it will be the most disenfranchised and impoverished people in Russia who will feel it the most. 

It’s still better than war, I think, because at least people suffering from poverty can be helped with humanitarian aid.

I really hope that whatever happens, the world will unite in addressing the after effects of all this.  This means sending support and aid, and also welcoming and providing support for all the refugees that come out of this, both from Ukraine and Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries that are affected by this.

The unity in voice and action by the west involving sanctions and punishment for Putin and his cronies, the underdog giving the much bigger bully an early ass kicking, and the individual acts of heroism the world has learned about over the course of the past week have created hope where there was previously despair.

However as the indiscriminate shelling and bombing rages on and Russian forces seek to simply encircle major cities and choke them off, the vibe is beginning to change. The notices sent to various ethnic populations such as Indians that they must leave by 6 tonight do not bode well. The crappy part is that Russia is beginning to utilize its low risk high damage tactics and equipment such as cruise missles and long artillery and its forcing to Ukrainians to fight a different war than the one that they had been so successful with so far and the early indicators are not good.

At this point, a large number of countries have got in on the sanctions and condemnation. Many civilian populations are enamored with this conflict and watching and rooting closely. Supporting how ever they can, but are emotionally invested in Ukraine, esp due to the images coming out of there. 

My question is this. If it goes real bad for Ukraine over the next week, and the Russian advance gains traction, especially in surrounding major cities and bombing them into oblivion, will the rest of the world and more specifically NATO and EU be able to watch that without getting involved in a more direct fashion?

I can really see that happening. Hopefully UM prevails and repels them completely.

I think Russia is fucked In this war, and that's coming from someone who 5 days ago was saying Putin pulled a brilliant move.  I was wrong then.

My major is in logistics. Logistics is the life blood of the world.  It's what makes things move and happen.  According to us sources 70%/ ~100k Russian troops are out/very low on food/fuel inside Ukraine.


We've heard of Corunna abandoned, and we've all seen the videos of farmers taking expensive military equipment.


It took Putin 3-6 months to put logistics in place for this invasion, and the logistics have completely failed.

Yes, Russia is using their artillery to level cities in Eastern Ukraine.  How many more shells do they have though?  We've seen so many pictures of captured supply trucks with ammo.

We know from the Iraq war that supplies have to constantly be brought in.

Yes, Russia has a lot more equipment in theory that they could throw into Ukraine.  However, that would leave Russia exposed internally and more importantly, take a long fucking time to get the logistics over.  Especially if Sabeteurs were able to sabotage Russian train lines from the inside.


If the ceasefire is allowed to happen, I fear it gives Russia time to get its shit in order.  I understand it also gives Ukraine time to get its shit in order too, but I think Russia is really winded right now and needs the recovery time more.

One thing is imposing sanctions and sending aid (both military and humanitarian). Russian completely expects this. The other actions mentioned above will be seen in Russia as an act of war and will bring about WW3.

Most of the former Eastern Bloc exists in a geographic feature called the North European Plain. It's extremely difficult to defend geographically. The plain opens up in Germany and extends outward in a conical fashion. Most of the NEP is currently occupied by non-NATO-aligned states, and the few borders Russia shares with NATO are narrow and defensible if a NATO attack were to come from one of those locations. Norway's border is functionally nonviable for a land invasion due to mountainous terrain. Estonia and Latvia are on the edge of the NEP and could be blocked off. In total, these borders comprise something like 10% of the total border area between Russia and non-Russian countries to the west.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Location_NATO_Russia.svg

Currently, from a perspective of pure land defense, Russia can therefore secure its borders relatively easily. Finland is not part of NATO, and its border is mountainous anyway with narrow gaps through several large Russian lakes. And Turkey's maritime borders provide no meaningful access for a full-scale ground troop invasion unless it departed from warships. Belarus and Ukraine are, *by far*, the best locations to launch a land invasion. They are both firmly in the NEP with no concrete land bridges, valleys, mountains, etc. to act as deterrents to invasion. If NATO were to stage an army in either of those countries, it could march in along hundreds of miles of unprotected, flatland fronts and absolutely barrel over the inferior Russian military both technologically and logistically. 

The current paradigm leaves Russia protected from direct NATO assault. NATO couldn't launch an attack from Norway without it being cut off, and it wouldn't have much infrastructure or wide access from Estonia or Norway. But if Ukraine joined NATO? Well, now there would be a *huge* shared border, in entirely indefensible terrain, within fighting distance of Moscow.

If we are to assume that Russia's military is paranoid and intensely distrustful of the mere existence of NATO, and if we are to further assume that the Russian military is actually kinda garbage with outdated tech and no training and that the Kremlin knows this (both assumptions being reasonable and well-justified in the present environment), then they actually would view a NATO Ukraine or NATO Belarus as a catastrophic development that essentially dooms them to their own invasion if NATO ever decided to do that. They would be sitting ducks but for nuclear deterrents that, despite Putin's bluster, are likely mismanaged and decaying as I type this and probably unable to provide a serious international threat even if their operators were to follow a launch command.

Not that NATO *would* invade or has any reason to do so. But Putin is clearly a paranoid strongman despot, and his government is clearly infiltrated with recursive propaganda about NATO threats that would likely affect top brass as much as it would any average Russian citizen. Belarus is a puppet state, and Ukraine *was* a puppet state, but that's not the case any longer. Russian-secured Ukraine as a satellite would mean no easy ground invasion. NATO-aligned Ukraine would mean the big bad wolf is at the doorstep and just blew all the little pig's walls down.

This is most assuredly not the only reason for the invasion. Soviet reunification, resource extraction, positioning to invade Moldova, or simple imperialism are all also likely motivators. But the NATO border argument isn't a red herring to me. It's something I would have to assume the Kremlin command is *very* concerned about.

Edit: [I've added the Wikipedia topographical map of the NEP here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Europe_topography_map_en.png/1280px-Europe_topography_map_en.png)

As can be seen somewhat easily looking at this map, Belarus provides a buffer zone from Poland. To directly attack Russia (not including the troops airlifted in like U.S. troops would be), troops in most NATO countries would need to enter from Germany, across Poland, up through Lithuania, and into Latvia, *and* Russia would have an elevation advantage as any attackers from Latvia or Estonia would have to march up about 600 feet of elevation, through hilly terrain, to get to any major targets in Russia. Norway's border is just mountains. It's a comparatively easy situation to defend from and allows for multi-front siege via Belarus. But if Ukraine is in play as a NATO staging ground, Russia has nothing at all to fall back to until the Ural Mountains, by which time the country is thoroughly lost given most of Russia's population lives west of the Urals.",1646244316.0,1646243080.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz2lzbv,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Norway's border with Russia is along a mountain range, not a very threatening route to invade from.

Ukraine is already a non-proliferation member and so they won't have nukes. This means that they probably don't want Ukraine to have either tactical cruise missiles or ballistic missiles. In any case, if you're trying to de-militarize a country you're really trying to make them into a puppet state. Not directly, but indirectly.

Fight for a dictator, or fight for your democracy, flawed as it may be? I know my opinion is biased but this seems a no brainer. For all the bad decisions in Iraq, the American motivation was never to just take over the country and control it. While I am certain there were some Iraqis that brought into that idea, based on reactions of the public, results on the ground, I don't think a lot of Iraqis did. That doesn't mean they loved having American troops there, but it was - in the short term - easier to tolerate than Saddam. Afghanistan is somewhat similar.

But Russian troops? They're there to reclaim Ukraine for mother Russia. Putin made that plain in his words. The motivations are completely different and imo are going to factor into morale problems/advantages.

Also, I'm wondering just how many of their nukes are actually functional.

I mean, even one functioning nuke that got past NATO air defenses would be catastrophic, but do they really have enough to end the world as we know it? LOLOL. How many of the ICBMs are really just rusting away in their silos, how many have been sold for scrap\*, how many won't fire because they weren't put together right, how many haven't been maintained to a degree that they're no more than a very expensive dirty bomb?

\*selling for scrap is troubling. Making a primitive nuclear weapon is not actually difficult (it's always been the delivery that is the challenge -- stoipping a missile from going boom on the launchpad is much harder, for example, than making a basic nuke go boom when it arrives.)

Plus a remaining member seat to vote against Russia on future substantive issues. A condemnation vote can also set the pretext for humanitarian missions which would make it more challenging for Russia to operate (lest they accidentally shell a UN mission), or even a Peacekeeping mission (albeit it would almost certainly be vetoed). Additionally, there are plenty of civil society organizations and companies whose bylaws or shareholder compacts that would prevent them from doing business in a country under condemnation (hence why you don't see a lot of companies running to open branches in Myanmar).

The real dollar exchange rate (not the one that the central bank drew, but the one that analysts wrote about was already about 100 rubles per dollar). 2) Many Russians have now suddenly discovered investments. Not out of patriotic or anti-Ukrainian feelings, simply because Sberbank shares are now worth 1 cent on the London stock exchange. And of course they will roll back - many will earn a lot of money on them. Corporations under sanctions are bad, of course, but pensions and savings of 145 million people were stored in this bank. Tomorrow Putin will decide to nationalize some of the ""optional"" (in his opinion, of course) dollar or euro assets and the banks will be backed up. 3) Nationalization will scare Russia, but it will not surprise. Both we and our ""friends"" from the former republics go through this amazing and terribly unpleasant process with a frequency of once every 40-60 years. If it was murderous, then the generation of thirty-year-olds simply would not have been born. 4) Most likely, part of the financing of the army comes from a gray economy like bitcoin. In January, an unknown person withdrew almost 6 billion rubles ($850 million) from one of the largest crypto exhangers and the West did not even notice it. I think there were a lot of such transactions (just in a smaller amount of tranches) and with this money they pay for the war. 5) The margin of safety is really large. Taxes and fees for small and medium-sized businesses have almost tripled over the past two years — they had time to accumulate assets 6) A lot of money is now simply ""returning"" to Russia.

I’ll do you all a favor and give you a link that was probably one of the better ones I have seen. I know none of you want to read. The only thing this video misses is the historical context. Kosovo, how in the beginning Putin wanted to work with the west but realized he wouldn’t be treated well. Remember after 9/11 Russia helped America. But in return it felt like it got dick. When the USSR fell it wasn’t like the west went to help stabilize it. It celebrated.

Edit: Russian military doctrine is heavy artillery support. So many people think Russia is gonna fold.

When the USA hit weddings and family homes and what not during the war on terror, it's not because they wanted to hit civilians, but instead because it's war, shit happens. 

Through the first few days, Russia took it a bit easy if anything, and seemed to think that a significant chunk of the population would view them as liberators. Obviously, and rightly, that's not the case. Fuck Russia but nothing you claim hints at nuclear war.",False,1646249875.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz36wa9,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Which makes more sense:

1.) Russia defensively launched a mass attack into Ukraine to de-nazify a small region on Ukraine’s border, and because they are scared that NATO will invade them (NATO is a defensive pact and cannot be triggered by a NATO country acting offensively)?

Or Russia dislikes NATO because Putin is a dictator who wants old Soviet territories back and is upset that he can’t invade them anymore?

2.) Ukraine has hit not one but a huge number of civilian centres in a game of 6D propaganda chess against the Russians and the world?

Or Putin ordered the missile strikes on civilian centres; he’s had a history of doing so in other conflicts and is strongly incentivized to demoralize the Ukrainian people?

3.) Russia, who was recently claiming zero casualties AFTER confirmed reports with photo evidence of at least a few hundred casualties widely circulated in the news, suddenly had a change of reporting integrity and is now super accurate with numbers?

Or Ukraine might be over counting, but their general reporting of events (liked downed planes and repelling Russian attacks) have generally been confirmed by other sources with photo/video evidence, so the numbers are probably not complete fabrications?",False,1646246734.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz2trf6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
65ecb5b6a9b4721a38be66b868ade988,t5529v,hz31cjr,"It's likely that neither are particularly accurate. Fog of war is going to make a solid accounting of losses difficult until everything is over; and both sides have an interest in interpreting the available information as favourably as possible for their PR. It's entrely possible that both sides are being 'honest' in their reporting, even if that's not likely. 

Ultimately, the Russians should have the best count (they know who they sent; so it should be simple enough to do a head count and see who didn't come back when everything settles down. Their official counts will likely be underestimates since it takes time to figure out who didn't check back in after a fight). However, We've already seen official Russian sources lie their asses off when it comes to this conflict. So we have no particular reason to trust what they' re saying. Russian figures are purely for domestic consumption; they're still trying to sell the idea of a short victorious war of liberation to their own people. They have to fess up to some casualties; since there are Russian soldiers that aren't going to come back. Ultimately though it's a lot easier for them to lie about their numbers to their own people and spin independant reports as western propaganda; since it's not like FOIA requests are a thing in Russian politics.

Ukranian figures are probably closer to being accurate; but they have the fog of war probalem as well. You'll only be able to count enemy KIA's if you control the territory after the battle; so most of their figures are probably estimates with a good deal of error in them (it's hard to count when you're being shot at). It's beneficial for PR purposes if the Russian casualties seem high (makes it seem like their putting up a good fight; which bolsters support both internally and abroad). They're probably less able to lie though. Since the fighting is in Ukraine, their own people will have a better idea of how things are going; and it's likely that excessively inflating casualty numbers would come back and bite them later in terms of morale. They also care a lot more about external opinion; since they need support from other countries to survive. Western nations have fairly capable intelligence networks of their own; and are likely to be more hesitant to help out if they can't trust what the Ukranians are saying. I'd imagine that Ukranian reports are taking the most optimistic estimates for publication; but they're less likely to be making stuff up.",False,1646247471.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz2trf6,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

So yes Putin doesn't believe Ukraine has a right to exist, but I'm not young and I've personally watched this from the fall of the Soviet Union and strongly thought NATO was over posturing and remilitarising the eastern block. 

I'll state unequivocally that I'm against this invasion, but I'm definitely not surprised, and no, U.S.A would not have tolerated a decades long militarisation by Russia on its doorstep. Remember also that with the series of problems that occurred along the way, Crimea, the revolution etc etc, the U.S hasn't been idle, they are always happy to fund destabilising efforts in times of flux. There are two protagonists here, not one, but I'll say again, I'm 100% against this invasion and I do not want to see Ukraine overrun. I want the Russian people to be aware of what is happening and rise up to stop it. I also have spent the last 30 years wanting western people to be aware we are poking a bear.

This is incorrect though. When Putin claims that Ukraine poses a security threat to Russia he's not wrong, just not in the way people understand it. He can not afford to have a functioning democracy in a neighboring country that is so tightly tied to his, because over time those ties will wear his regime down. 

It's also why he rails so much against NATO/EU expansion - he can not afford Eastern European countries that he wishes were in his sphere of influence to move West, because the more democratic they get (even deeply flawed ones like Poland and Hungary), the more he risks losing support at home.

So no, even if he got Crimea and the Donbass and the de-militarisation of Ukraine, as long as it has remotely free and fair elections, he will feel threatened in one way or another (which, in his mind, is enough pretext for a war).",False,1646244083.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz2rv2i,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Flygvapnet genomförde en insats med Jas 39 Gripen ur incidentberedskapen och dokumenterade händelsen, i form av fotografering.
– Detta visar att vår beredskap är god. Vi var på plats för att säkra den territoriella integriteten och Sveriges gränser. Vi har full koll på läget, säger flygvapenchef Carl-Johan Edström.
Det var två ryska SU 27 och två ryska SU 24, som kränkte svenskt luftrum. Kränkningen var kortvarig och skedde öster om Gotland, över hav.
– Mot bakgrund av det rådande läget ser vi mycket allvarligt på händelsen.  Det är ett oprofessionellt och oansvarigt agerande från rysk sida, säger flygvapenchefen.",False,1646247287.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz30sqq,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

e832bb8ea1a421d5d47574b059124f60,t5529v,hz2st6e,"From the perspective of Russia, it’s not bullshit.

First, at the risk of stating the obvious, we (meaning the west) know that we would never attempt to invade Russia. Obviously. But this fact is not so clear when you’re a Russian. You can call this paranoia on their end, but it has historical precedent: all of Russia’s existential crises (bar one involving Mongolia) have come from invasions to the west. 


Also consider that drawn borders will continue to exist (generally) for decades. Who knows wht the european political landscape will look like 50 years from now? Maybe we won’t be as defensive-minded as we are know? I want to stress that I’m playing devil’s advocate here, I don’t believe this myself, but I can understand their reasoning somewhat. Point is, simply saying “nato would never attack russia”, while true, skips over alot of nuance.

Secondly, strategically Russia is vulnerable to the west (like I said, they have a history of western invasions). Everything between Romania/Poland and Russia (ie Belarus and Ukraine) is flat as a pancake, so troops can advance quickly. Compound this with another Russian problem in that the country is very big and it takes time for their military to mobilize troops to the western border, and you can maybe see where their fears come from. 

Historically, Russia’s answer to this was Defense in Depth: stopping any marching troops at (what is now) the Belarus/Ukraine borders, then retreat tactically to allow troops in the mainland to mobilize. This has helped them greatly in the past: Napoleon and Hitler both tried and failed to invade Russia due to this. But you can underdtand that being able to post up on those Ukrainian borders is essential for this tactic. If Ukraine joins NATO, they won’t have this buffer for tactical retreat, and thus (in Russia’s eyes) are more vulnerable to an invasion. Putin (and by extension, most ex-ussr politicians that surround him) sees this as an existential threat.

There's likely truth in all of that. Ukraine is having a hard time defending, but Russia also misjudged the effort it would take.

If this was planned months in advance it was planned incredibly poorly. Sure, they stockpiled cash, but that cash was useless once disconnected from the international finance system.

1. I would have started with an extensive psy-ops campaign in Ukraine destroying confidence in Zelensky and the government in general, questioning legitimacy. This is one thing that Russia has excelled at lately, particularly in the US.
2. I would have had Russian factories on overtime making rations, ammunition, and fuel. I would probably have tried to mask this production under the guise of ""humanitarian aid"", probably for Syria.
3. The holding force in Belarus was a good idea but I was pretty suprised that it was deployed as a lightning strike against Kyiv. That was a tactical blunder. It should have been kept in reserve, well supplied, until the north was considerably weakened.
4. I would have staged half of my forces in Donetsk/Luhansk, and overran the Eastern defences of the UA, then cut the country in half up to the river. The S could be held down by sustained air force and naval action similar to what they are actually doing.

They are still broadcasting communications on unencrypted radio. Anyone with a radio set can listen in on them. And can also figure out where they are broadcasting from. Hiding your communications is WAR 101 level stuff and they still haven't realized. 

My guess is Putin has surrounded himself with yes men and is directing the war himself. (It was reported he executed all the military folk who were against the war.)

1) the Russian army is very corrupt, and may not have had the equipment/manpower they were reporting when Putin ordered them to start mobilizing, so they had to pull in conscripts quickly l.

2)conscripts don’t want to be there, and didn’t know they would actually go fight Ukraine

3)The US leaking Russia’s plans pushed back the planned invasion date after everything had been deployed already so that Putin could pretend the West was lying. This caused them to start eating into their food/fuel supplies before actually starting the invasion

4) the delay also pushed them further into the thaw, and the fields aren’t traversable, only the roads.

5) Russia’s military organization (battalion tactical groups) decentralize control quite a bit and lead to communications issues. That’s further exacerbated by the road conditions, causing the BTGs to split up to try and move quickly. Units aren’t moving cohesively, and sometimes you see fuel and artillery vehicles coming into contact with opponents before the infantry/armour…. Which doesn’t end well.

6)Ukrainians are defending their homes- they are far more incentivized to fight hard

7) The Ukrainian army has been fighting since 2014, against Russian-backed separatists, so they’re far more veteran than the Russian conscript forces

8) tons of weapons being sent to the Ukrainians to make them harder to beat

The modern nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine all claim Kievan Rus' as their cultural ancestors, with Belarus and Russia deriving their names from it. The Rurik dynasty would continue to rule parts of Rus' until the 16th century with the establishment of the Tsardom of Russia.

ETA This was just reported:

Russian fighter jet has violated Swedish airspace  
Four Russian fighter jets have violated Swedish airspace, the Swedish Armed Forces writes on its website.  
The Air Force carried out an operation with Jas 39 Gripen out of the emergency preparedness and documented the incident, in the form of photography.  
\- This shows that our preparedness is good. We were on site to ensure territorial integrity and Sweden's borders. We have full control of the situation, says Air Force Chief Carl-Johan Edström.  
Two Russian SU 27s and two Russian SU 24s violated Swedish airspace. The violation was short-lived and took place east of Gotland, across the sea.  
\- In light of the current situation, we take the incident very seriously. It is an unprofessional and irresponsible action on the part of Russia, says the air force chief.

It stands for Massive Ordnance Air Blast and is nicknamed the mother of all bombs. It is a U.S. weapon and was used in Afghanistan. It killed 94 ISIS-K along with a teacher and her son who happened to be walking nearby.

The Russian counterpart is the Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power and is nicknamed the Father of All Bombs (FOAB) because it is supposed to be 4x more powerful than the MOAB. I don’t believe it has ever been used in combat.

>	There were about 6,000 Chinese nationals still in Ukraine when the war began, according to the embassy. It had said on Thursday that it was arranging charter flights to evacuate citizens who wanted to leave the country.

>	China’s efforts to evacuate its citizens came much later than those of other countries, including the United States, Britain and Norway – all of which urged their nationals to leave Ukraine more than a week before Russia’s military assault. Beijing’s mission in Ukraine had on February 21 issued a notice on WeChat reminding Chinese nationals and businesses to take safety precautions.

[Literal Chinese Propaganda (Global Times), Mar 1, 2022](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202203/1253650.shtml):

>	In one of the largest Chinese citizen evacuations in history, the Chinese embassy in Ukraine has already arranged the departure of some 2,300 fellow citizens from the country in just two days. The vast majority of the evacuees, about 2,200, traveled in buses escorted by embassy staff and local police forces to ensure a safe and quick exit to neighboring countries, with the rest going by train, still one of the safest ways out apart from by road.  

>	However, some Western media outlets such as CNN and The New York Times have been hyping that China's response to the Ukraine crisis ""could be putting its citizens in danger"" and some even hyped that China ""leaves citizens stranded in Ukraine"", exaggerating and distorting a very small-scale of online comments on Chinese social media and claiming they are ""cheering Russia's invasion,"" which led to some negative sentiment among Ukrainians.

 >The Tatars (; Tatar: татарлар, tatarlar, تاتارلر, Crimean Tatar: tatarlar; Old Turkic: 𐱃𐱃𐰺, romanized: Tatar) is an umbrella term for different Turkic ethnic groups bearing the name ""Tatar"". Initially, the ethnonym Tatar possibly referred to the Tatar confederation. That confederation was eventually incorporated into the Mongol Empire when Genghis Khan unified the various steppe tribes. Historically, the term Tatars (or Tartars) was applied to anyone originating from the vast Northern and Central Asian landmass then known as Tartary, a term which was also conflated with the Mongol Empire itself.

Biden was given many different options to prevent this, including keeping a few thousand non-combat troops in support roles. He rejected all the options he was presented with other than a total and complete withdrawal of all American personnel, which resulted in the collapse of the Afghan military, the stranding of tens of thousands of Americans and our allies, the deaths of 13 servicemembers, and the rape, enslavement, torture, murder and oppression of over 10 million girls and young women.

The answer to that is ""that's a stupid question"", because none of that exists.

And as for your point about language, it's not ""the left"" changing the meaning of things like antifa, it's the right. Like the ""ok"" sign (thumb and forefinger touching). Used to mean ok, now means I'm a Nazi. Except I'll still use it while scuba-diving, because *context*.

It's the *right* that has decided that being anti-fascist is being an evil anarcho-commie or whatever brain diseased fantasy they espouse this season, mainly because the traditional right wing in America has gone full far-right, allied more with parties like the FN in France than the moderate right. Their strategy is to confuse, obfuscate, and misinform, because if people really understood them a majority would never go near them with a 10 foot pole. 

If you are obsessed with the meaning of words to such an extent, and follow the meanings *they* attribute to things, you'll keep changing definitions until your brain explodes and nobody understands you. Which is what the opposition *wants*. That is their strategy. They dogwhistle and redefine and double-standard and flood misinformation everywhere until nobody knows wtf is real anymore.

No, you're literally saying that it's absolutely the same thing if Ukraine joins the NATO, has some obligations as a result and a few limits in its foreign policy as a result, and if the Russians conquer Ukraine, kill tens of thousands of Ukrainians, force millions of Ukrainians to flee, and then keep an occupational force in place, leaving the Ukrainians absolutely no choice in their governing whatsoever because every decision is made for them by the Kremlin which will send in the military if the Ukrainians protest.

No one is forcing Ukraine to join NATO. They have alternatives. They can cozy up to the Russians instead. They can attempt to achieve the neutral status you were talking about. They could even - very theoretically - somehow attempt to become friendly with China and hope to rely on their protection. Ukraine looked at those alternatives, decided the NATO option was best, and Russia brought the hammer down. 

The definition of voluntary is that they made the choice - they did - and that they had a viable alternative (because no, if you only had one choice it wasn't really voluntary). The fact that this decision is influenced by outside factors doesn't make it less voluntary, because *every* decision is influenced by outside factors.",False,1646248188.0,t3_t5529v,t1_hz31rjp,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

Well, obviously SWIFT wouldn't ""be down"" very long if they retreated, offered Putin to the ICC, and established democratic elections.

The ruble is trash. Dollars speak volumes. Your question is irrelevant, because the risk free offer either works or doesn't.

> How can they be sure you will honor your side of the deal?

Zelensky pays out the first $45k upon retreat. They would have no reason to doubt that we'd pay $100 billion for what we would be asking. Again, it's not *that* much money lol
