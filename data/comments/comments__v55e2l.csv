The position it is in, is a nightmare for Ukraine forces anyway, with it being on the wrong side of the river, but it is under cover of Ukraine artillery the whole time, and has caused Russian deaths far exceeding any strategic value.

Basically I see it as completely brainless and unnecessary.

Putin has thrown away we don't actually know how many lives, for a city that should not have been directly attacked, and is now supposedly giving orders to capture it by June 10th or get fired.

It isn't even directly encircled, rather he seems to have settled for it being a terrifying experience to get into, and then launched a head on assault straight into urban warfare.

This attack has been a godsend for any Ukrainian unit not in the city, because now the other fronts are crippled due to the focus on Severo and Luhansk as a whole, while Severo gets treated like the fucking Thunderdome.

Ukrainian forces in the contested eastern city of Sieverodonetsk have been facing off against Russian-led Separatist Forces originating from Luhansk, the U.K.’s Ministry of Defence said.

The ministry said these forces are poorly equipped and trained and lack heavy equipment, as compared with regular Russian units. It said using proxy troops is a Russian tactic that was previously seen in Syria and suggests a desire to limit casualties among Moscow’s own forces.

> Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, June 4
> Jun 4, 2022 - Press ISW

> Ukrainian forces are successfully slowing down Russian operations to encircle Ukrainian positions in Luhansk Oblast as well as Russian frontal assaults in Severodonetsk through prudent and effective local counterattacks in Severodonetsk and their defense of the western Siverskyi Donets riverbank. Ukrainian officials reported on June 3 that Ukrainian defenders pushed back against Russian advances in Severodonetsk and are actively hindering Russian advances on Lysychansk from the southwest. Luhansk Oblast Administration Head Serhiy Haidai disagreed with the UK Defense Ministry forecast on June 3 that Russian forces will seize the remaining 10% of the oblast in the next two weeks, claiming that Ukrainian forces have enough reinforcements and equipment to conduct further counterattacks and defend their positions. Haidai noted that Russian forces wrongfully believe in their own successes, enabling Ukrainian defenders to inflict high losses against unsuspecting Chechen units. Pro-Russian milblogger Voenkor Kotyenok Z claimed that Russian forces are unlikely to break through Ukrainian defenses in Lysychansk from Severodonetsk (through continued frontal assaults and an opposed crossing of the Siverskyi Donetsk River) and will likely need to complete the drive from Popasna if they hope to capture Lysychansk. Voenkor Kotyenok Z claimed that Ukrainian forces could prevent Russian river crossings from Severodonetsk and highlighted that Russian forces have not yet secured access to two key highways to Lysychansk.

Day 102 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Shelling was really bad today; it started around 9pm and went on for about an hour after that, some shells were aimed somewhere at the center of the city, others at residential districts, it was very loud here. Even after the shelling was largely over there were still some singular explosions all the time, but right now it’s pretty quiet. 

Before the shelling started people were seeing the battlefield illumination in the distance, which was probably used to aim their artillery better. We actually saw that same exact thing yesterday somewhere in the vicinity of Cherkaski Tyshky judging by the map, later that day it was confirmed that that settlement was shelled.
 
Interesting thing is that when shelling was just starting, the lights started flickering first and then after about 4-5 seconds we actually heard the sound of shelling, so it was pretty far away from us. Thankfully the electricity didn’t get cut off, the flickering only continued for a couple minutes and it was fine after that.

And it looks like the counteroffensive in Sievierodonetsk is going well, during the day it was said by officials that around 50% of the city was recaptured, and now there are reports that are saying that as much as 80% of the city is now under our control again, which is pretty amazing if true, considering that in the past 2 weeks everyone was saying that the city is lost or that it will fall in the next couple of days.",False,1654480531.0,t3_v55e2l,t3_v55e2l,,0,102,0,102,1,0,

*It is as if the Russians (those with a bit of a brain, not the TV-watching “Z”ombies) are beginning to realise what sort of a shithole they got themselves into now that so little has been achieved by one of the strongest armies in the world, and so much has already been lost, mainly in terms of human casualties. The Donbas, the very claimed core of this struggle, is not just not “liberated”, it in fact remains under constant “threat”, and the special operation arguably made things much worse than before 24 February – opposite of the effect it was meant to have.*  
  
*Truths of various degrees of severity and pain are finding their way through the tracks the surface. They are getting louder, but unlike in the early days in February, March, perhaps even April and May, where one would listen to doom analyses of Girkin-Strelkov thinking the man has rats running a party in the attic, now the personal attacks on him increased which he acknowledges almost on a daily basis. And the man hasn’t really changed his rhetoric since then.*  
  
*Truths about the unbelievable state of the Russian Armed Forces, about insane treatment of D/LPR mobilised men thrown in like meat to plug holes in the Russian defence/offence, about the lack of essential supplies from medicines to reconnaissance drones, about failures of the first stage of the operation, about stalling of the second stage, about unexpected resistance of Ukrainians… more and more of these truths emerge in regular comms and get picked up even by those who a month or two ago were vehemently proclaiming successes of the Russian offensive.*

For context, a copy/paste of a previous post of mine: Russia functionally doesn't have real-time surveillance satellites. Since 2000 they have launched approximately 4 satellites with digital imagery capabilities, all others take images through film and when commanded, load the film up in re-entry cannisters and drop them from orbit for collection, development, and analysis. Of those digital satellites, the last three are the important ones. The first of which failed in orbit, and the most recent of which was launched in ~2017. Those satellites were designed with a three year orbital lifespan (fuel allotment).

So it is quite likely that throughout this war, Russia has NOT had orbital real-time reconnaissance capabilities.

For reference, the United States National Reconnaissance Office alone currently has something like 45 reconnaissance satellites by itself, to say nothing of the other branches of the defense department.

So my theory is that some of the attacks are simply that Russia doesn't actually KNOW where to attack and someone's being told to do SOMETHING to try and stem the tide of foreign weapons. Since they don't actually have any real reconnaissance on where the weapons are flowing through, they're pretty much picking random big buildings and hoping for the best.",False,1654409325.0,t3_v55e2l,t3_v55e2l,,0,48,0,48,0,0,

Imagine some normal country, let’s say Switzerland for no particular reason, let’s say Switzerland one day declares war on every other country on the planet. And let’s say that there isn’t anybody that wants to fight, and every country in the world surrenders. We give up. The world is now Switzerland. They conquered it all. You used to have a country, now you have a Canton in Switzerland.



What actually changes? Is life different for an ordinary Swiss person? Is the economy of original Switzerland any different? Is original Switzerland richer? No. Except for having a much larger government building, practically nothing is different.


Economic activity doesn’t happen ‘by country’. Economic activity happens by person, and by company. People generate the economic activity and pay the taxes that pave their roads. Issuing them a new passport doesn’t change the nature of their job, or change the cost of paving the road. A Russian saw-mill with Russian employees functions exactly the same with a Russian flag, a Chinese flag, or a Swiss flag flying over head. You ‘get’ the lumber by paying for the lumber. You have to pay. The employees need to eat. Their equipment needs fuel. The business has to keep running.



It’s the 21st century. Everybody trades with everybody. National jurisdictions matter a little in terms of which legal system is operating and who gets to decide what to do with any tax revenue, but fundamentally which country some ‘asset’ is in is fairly irrelevant.

7170dafe3af07ca1ae3bb0bbf7ef3905,v55e2l,ib8cr4x,"Been thinking about something let's say unresolved concerning that [grenade stunt](https://wartranslated.com/intercepted-call-russian-soldiers-ready-to-kill-their-general/) story where a heavily-reduced btg kinda sorta mutinied because an irate general showed up and tried to threaten them into getting back to the front (since they're paid per attack and also their contract was up soon) by shooting at their feet.  

The caller identifies a Col. General Solodchuk.  It would be a very big deal for a col. general (3-star) to show up to the front period, much less waste time harassing a 200-odd man group.  It would be especially strange in light of the 9 generals that have already died on the front lines and Gerasimov's near-miss.  None of those killed have been colonel generals.  No one's really mentioning this in the context of the reported mutiny.  (Again, 'mutiny', because their obligations are somewhat complicated).  Yet I'm leaning toward it having happened.  

The other thing is Solodchuck is ostensibly Valeriy Solodchuck who commanded DNR forces in the 2010s as a Maj. Gen.  As recently as [May 11](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-general-officer-guide-may-11), he's been known to us as Lt. General (2-stars).  And he was last seen commanding the 36th combined army which was stationed at Irpin, Bucha, and other towns at the front NW of Kyiv.  

And I have to say I'm inclined to believe Solodchuk was there, whether or not the grenade thing happened, and that his rank was accurately reported by the caller.  But that would suggest the following things:  

- Solodchuk has been promoted quite recently to Col. Gen., without having achieved that promotion through acts since his unit was recalled from the north and didn't accomplish anything.  His unit is back in action in the Donbas at some state of reduced efficiency, under another commander.  This further suggests:  
- More generals behind the scenes have been fired than just Dvornikov and Gerasimov, and people are being rapidly promoted to replace them, and
- Solodchuk with his failures in Kyiv oblast is somehow at the top of that list.  
- Russia's still sending top generals to the front, for reasons.  

I've always accepted they're going to run out of people before they run out of equipment, but I really wouldn't have thought they'd be going through higher-ranked officers at such a pace.  It's not like they'll ever 'run out of generals', but they are apparently starting to promote horribly incompetent people to replace the ones that have fallen out of favor.  

The irrational behavior attributed to Solodchuk tracks, frankly.  If you were quick-promoted twice in the span of a failed war and everyone higher than you has been fired and a quarter of your peers have been killed and you already had a strike against you, you might point guns at encamped men mistaking their waiting for rehabilitation as cowardice.",False,1654416146.0,t3_v55e2l,t3_v55e2l,,0,0,0,0,0,0,

122 GRAD, 220 Uragan and the 300 Tornado & Smerch out of these the Uragan, Tornado and Smerch can fire their missiles at 90km range.

HOWEVER and this is a big one and why US MLRS and its missiles that come with it are monumentally better.

While Russians and Ukrainians have missiles that can hit at 90km the disperssion of these missiles at this range is so large you would not be able to hit anything. The missiles have no flight correction, no guidance, no homing, no ewar evasion.

Their effective range is usually at 40% that range. And even at that range the chance of hitting the desired target is <10%. So they use it as an area supression weapon.

US MLRS in the other first offers a much better launcher the M999 which is much lighter and configurable so it can fire a full family of rockets. 1 launcher can fire 6 rockets (M,XM) or 1 missile (ATACMS) by just reconfiguring the pod at any time (takes minutes).

The launcher is mounted on two platforms HIMARS (1 launcher on a very fast/mobile truck), M270 (2 launchers on a slower but armoured tank chasiss).

And they fire a santandard rocket M31A2 this rocket can reach between 70-120km range(44-60 miles) and is precision guided to the target destination, it will do flight corrections and once it approaches the target it sill use active search and homing to hit the target with <5m precision.

There used to be M26 and M30, M26 missile was for cluster bombardment and has been phazed out, M30 is pretty much same as M31 just different type od warhead.

Than there is also XM which Ukraine is getting which can do loitering and ATACMS which Ukraine will not get whos range is 150-300km with much heavier payload usually to target large targets.

Ukraine has their own ATACMS like missile Toschka-U with nearly similar ranges.

The precision and having the effective range same as maximum range is why US MLRS will be much better. 6 missiles will mean 6 destroyed targets.",1654430288.0,1654422503.0,t3_v55e2l,t1_ib8focg,,1,67,0,67,0,0,

Well ofc the question is how much they would send over and what's the variant

For example on the HIMARS, the US would send 4 and that's only with the M30 Rockets that's topped up at 70 km (roughly the same as the BM-30 that Ukraine currently uses)

Same as the Gray Eagle that's got 4 units, and the M777 while is sent in an impressive 100 number is uh... well, the Marine corps hand me down version

It helps but I doubt at the current build up level it can turn the tide of war

Hell at the current rate, Ukraine might have to wait till next summer.

The West simply can't commit to the send the weapons without leaving a reserves gap for their own use. It's enough to blunt the Russian forces everytime they commit to a front but for a counteroffensives? Yeah I doubt it",1654428123.0,1654427615.0,t3_v55e2l,t1_ib8ncve,,1,-11,0,-11,0,0,

I think that rather depends on whether the embassy was specifically targeted, whether that can be proved, and whether precautions were taken to avoid casualties.

If there is clear evidence that Russia targeted an embassy with intent to kill its ambassador or other diplomats, it would be a major international incident in clear violation of diplomatic norms and would likely lead to a significant break in diplomatic ties with Russia: think diplomatic missions being closed/ambassadors withdrawn/expelled etc.

If the Ukrainians really have the advantage here, they should fight.

But if they can maximize the loss of Russian equipment / deplete the strength of as many Russian BTGs as possible, that'd be the ideal kind of withdrawal.

If the Ukrainians do well enough, they might be able to even hold onto Severodontesk, and use it as a staging ground for taking back Luhansk.

That said, the entire area west of Severodonetsk has a lot of high ground and hilly terrain. It overlooks the entire river and most of the town itself. There are robust trench systems and it's known Ukraine has stuffed the hill full of artillery using PGMs. The hills are _extremely_ defensible - the only way Russia can crack it is from the air, and Russia does not have air supremacy.

Anything in Severodonetsk, anything trying to cross the river, anything on the roads - those are all exposed to the hilltops. Lots of milbloggers were chatting about this and how it's obvious that Ukraine was falling back to pre-prepared defenses across the river. Russia knew this, too, and there's videos from the TikTok brigade casually patrolling the town, knowing the Ukrainians were falling back to defenses across the river...

...except the retreat was a feint, and Ukraine transitioned the retreat into a counterattack.

The problem is that the city isn't terribly defensible. The most defense the Ukrainians have are using the buildings for street fighting, building-to-building. The Ukrainian Foreign Legion is doing some of the fighting here; there's some videos going around of an Australian and an American in the city getting ready for Fallujah-style urban combat. It's veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who are used to this sort of stuff (from the other side, mind, but same concept).

But at the end of the day, Russia can level the buildings and demolish the town. The city doesn't have any natural defenses and the Ukrainians are not fighting from prepared defenses. Strategically, the better option for Ukraine is to cede some ground and hammer them from the hilltops, as they are currently doing around Lyman. But the opportunity was there to take the Russian soldiers off-guard and damage their morale, which Ukraine did.

No to send a message to the other world superpower you had to call up the ambassador, and he would drive over  and you would have a chat.

Well that's all well and good when your countries are only glaring across the Berlin wall at each other, but in a crisis? Well the ambassador doesn’t have all the answers to a rapidly changing situation, and you can't exactly phone up Nikita at the Kremlin, so they had to go through all sorts of hoops, including radio moscow reading a message intended for the Americans, just so they didn't nuke themselves.

And that's why there's a hot line between moscow and Washington. Keep in mind that this was when both countries had diplomatic relations with each other. 

Now take that away, and try to figure out whether the latest troop movement is just an exercise or the beginning of world war 3. Ultimately it's a good idea to keep talking with the idiot with half the world's nukes

In short, right now higher powers are tying Ukraine's hand, but Russia is poking the Ukrainian bear with this one.

Ukraine also doesn't want to target civilian centres.

I mean, what is the standard operating procedure for preventing drone strikes? Is it air superiority or is it using jamming technology? For as I can see, Russia cannot claim territory without air cover. Western anti-air systems must not be capable of being dealt with by Russia?

Everybody looks at the concept of mobilization and thinks ""Ah, the Russians will suddenly have an extra few million soldiers and just slam in like a tidal wave."" but that's not really how it works. That's not even how it worked for the Soviet Union who was actually GOOD at that kind of tactic.

You can't just hand people a gun and tell them to start marching without keeping them fed, giving them some place to rest, warm when necessary, etc. All of that falls under logistics. Russia's problem is their logistical system cannot cope with the situation it finds itself in. Their original doctrine specifies a massed attack that pushes the front forward by tens of miles, then they halt and consolidate while their locomotive engineering brigades build out their train tracks to the edge of the new front. Once this is done, they get fully supplied and push out again. What they've found is that they can barely actually feed their current troops with this tactic, partly because they can't bring the trains as close to the front as in wars past. Modern weapons and ranges ensure that the trains have to stay WELL back, necessitating they use trucks to move cargo.

There are three problems Russia has with their trucks.

 * They don't have enough of them. A Russian BTG actually has a higher percentage of vehicles in it than an American force of equivalent size, by about 30% if I remember right. The same BTG also has half the number of trucks that the American force does. So fewer trucks are spread across more vehicles. Over a short distance, that's not so bad, but the trucks have to cross a LARGER distance than previously.

 * VERY few of the Russian trucks have cranes attached. This means that loading/offloading of material is a by-hand process. For reference, something like 40-60% of American military trucks have an inbuilt crane to facilitate loading/offloading.

 * Even worse for Russia, we have seen very little evidence they are using pallets for their supplies. Whenever Russian logistics vehicles are captured, they almost always contain stacks of two-man-crates. Those big wooden/metal boxes with a handle on either side that require two men to move. There was an experiment the US military did about a hundred years ago at this point. They had a train car loaded with those sorts of crates and unloaded it as fast as they could using only the number of men normally assigned such a task. It took about a day and a half of labor to offload and store the crates. Then the same task was done with pallets and forklifts. Took about 2 hours.

LONG story short, their logistical systems couldn't support the extra troops that a mobilization effort would add. The only thing it would do is just ensure that Russia stays at approximately their current deployed troop numbers for the length of the war. Meanwhile the morale of their military will further plummet because people training in the back areas will know that the only reason THEY are getting to the front is because of the sheer number of people that had to die for them to get there.",False,1654461154.0,t3_v55e2l,t1_ibaf5oh,,2,36,0,36,0,0,

Russian forces still outnumber them. Sure, they're incompetent buffoons, but that only means that Ukraine needs to advance slowly, carefully, and methodologically. A few bad battles can ruin Ukraine's smaller force. 

Ukraine cannot afford to lose soldiers right now. So they have to remain careful. We know that long term support is coming, so its important for the veterans to survive and become the next wave's Sergeants / leaders.

--------

This is very much like ""Battle of Midway"" situation / USA's Pacific campaign in WW2. Japan had a bigger Navy in the 1st year (because of the Pearl Harbor surprise attack). Similarly, Russia has a bigger Army than Ukraine (because Ukraine wasn't fully mobilized in February, and USA's supplies were slowly delivered over the next few months).

In the long term, USA's weapons production is unrivaled. Ukraine will have a bigger army eventually, but the **current** army needs to carefully take important battles and try not to lose.

Severodontesk is beginning to look like the Ukrainian equivalent of ""The Battle of Midway"", Japan **should** have won that battle by almost any reasonable analysis (more battleships, more carriers, USA's entire Battleship fleet sunk, Carriers highly damaged, Air Force pilots were mostly green recruits who couldn't dive bomb and USA's air-launched torpedo technology **consistently** failed to detonate), but a surprise trap/counter-attack solidified the USA's Naval advantage.",1654444180.0,1654443958.0,t3_v55e2l,t1_ib98xgu,,2,10,0,10,0,0,

Against Ukraine, they don't have the vast numbers advantage they did against the Finns. In fact, if they hadn't performed so poorly in the Winter War, their lend-lease requirements might have been a lot less.

In the peer conflict that was WW2, the Red Army was essentially kept afloat only because the US was supplying things like planes, trucks, and artillery at a phenomenal rate. Sure, by the late war, domestic Soviet production was much better than it was in 1941, and if we look at planes, arguably producing some of the finest piston engined fighters ever built as the war drew to a close, like the Yak-3, and the just postwar La-9 or La-11.

So basically, the question is, how long will Russia be able to last in a peer conflict, against a military with *better* equipment, *more* soldiers, and without the bailout it had in WW2. Every loss Russia takes right now is permanent, every day this war drags on weakens their army substantially.

Also, they died in the horrible numbers that they did because they were so horribly undertrained and underequipped. Their eventual success in WWII is largely because they (better late than never) joined the winning team. Which brings to WWII. 

So the WWII trinity is ""British intelligence, American steel and Soviet blood"", and as Ox has pointed out here, Ukraine is actually the inheritor of the Soviet leg of the trinity. While they aren't quite receiving the quantity of arms that the Soviets got, the quality of intelligence and materiel that Ukraine is receiving (especially recently) is almost peerless.

But had they been diligent about jamming and blanking out the abilities of commercially available drones (which all operate on internationally agreed-to frequencies and standards), they probably would not have had so many drones used against them to the degrees the Ukrainians have been able to been employ on the battlefield. Military-grade drones like the Bayraktar would probably hold up better, as they are built to cut through countermeasures, but a lot if the retail drones would have been far less effective.

Air superiority and air dominance are a bit of a separate issue from the drones. The big issue for the Russians are the single-purpose air assets, limited precision guidance equipment for non-ground attack craft for stand-off precision argeting runs, and the lack of coordination between ground forces for proper combined arms. Their fighters do fighter things, but lack the ability (and pilots, the training) to execute tactical strikes, which means it's down to the ground support aircraft and helicopter assets, which are getting shot up at a prodigious rate.  It's like having quite a few spoons when you need a knife and fork. The Russians painted themselves into the corner, and a majority of the shorties they fly are pretty much spent drawing shapes in the air. Safe, but useless to the ground war.

Drones tend to be much harder to intercept with airpower, due to the operational altitude and size of targets - you have to be as large as a Predator before interceptors really come into play (and note that Predators have only been considered now, with the operational fatigue and maintenance issues from lack of parts and supplies finally catching up with the Russian Air Force). So it would be electronic warfare at play to reduce the operational range and effectiveness of drones, with MANPADs and other anti-drone weaponry to damage or destroy anything that gets through.   

It takes a bit of reading and learning to get familiar with what can make military operations succeed or fail. Admittedly, even as an analysis wonk as I tend to be, I'm always learning something new. But it's a complicated web of issues that will sink any military, not a singular issue of note. I've went quieter about trying to explain how complex it is, as for every 1 or 2 people that understand how complex an issue every factor can be, you have 20 screaming 'Give them X and Y now - it will solve everything!' It's a complex thing - good on you for trying to figure it out!

FYI: daisy cutters are *not thermobarics.*  They are just large bombs.  Their use in Vietnam was mostly to clear LZs for helicopters (flattening trees), but, sometimes to hit large targets like warehouses & truck parks, or to clear mines.

The MOAB's been used in combat, IIRC, 1 (one) time, with, depending on reports, 0 or 2 civilian casualties, after a lot of coordination to get everyone who wasn't ISIL out of the area.  It was used to collapse a cave complex.

Anything smaller than an artillery rocket, a thermobaric doesn't do the lung-ripping ickiness.  It's more like a standard HE blast wave, but, more distributed.  Same technology, but a totally different purpose; this also goes for Russian and Western ""hand-held flame-throwers"", which are actually unguided rockets that have a tiny thermobaric warhead.  They basically do a tiny fuel-air bomb in a room so that you don't kill people outside that room, to reduce civilian casualties--think snipers shooting from an occupied building.  So when you hear about like a TOW with a ""thermobaric warhead"", it's not doing what the Russians are doing with firing waves of them to do horrible things to lots of people, its trying to use lower pressure-wave mechanics to do bad things *in* enclosed spaces without making those bad things hurt people *outside* said enclosed spaces.

And no, that doesn't rip out lungs...it just splatters everyone in the room gorily like any other weapon of war.  Seriously war is a messy, horribly violent affair, good reason people try not to do it too often.  *How* someone dies doesn't matter as long as it's quick enough they don't feel it for more than a millisecond, whether or not it's shrapnel, blast wave, blown in half, ejected in pieces out a tank, headshotted, etc.",False,1654479989.0,t3_v55e2l,t1_ibbdhdf,,3,8,0,8,0,0,

I took '2500' from memory, having read it somewhere. 

But now I only find this sentence:

*The new development comes after rumors had spread that the Russians were pulling a number of the T-62s out of long-term storage. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Russians have 10,000 tanks and 8,500 armored vehicles in storage — although that number doesn't take into account their material condition — with about 2,500 of those being T-62s as estimated by a Stratfor analysis. Being that we’ve already seen Russian forces using older T-72A/B variants in Ukraine and that some of the purported 10,000 tanks in storage are likely to be more modern than T-62s, the choice to move these specific vehicles to the front is undoubtedly intriguing.*

> French President Emmanuel Macron asked Ukraine to give up some of its land to reach a peace deal with Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested in an interview with Italian television.

> Speaking late Thursday to public broadcaster RAI, Zelenskyy responded tetchily to a question about Macron’s idea that Russia should not be “humiliated” in a peace settlement, lest it might fuel resentment leading to a new war.

> His comments were broadcast in Italian via an interpreter.

> “To propose to us to give up something as far as our sovereignty is concerned to save (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin’s face does not seem like a fair thing on the part of some leaders,” he said.

> “We are not ready to save someone’s face paying with our territories, I don’t think it’s fair,” the Ukrainian leader insisted, calling the suggestion “wasted time.”

His Ba'ath party was supposed to be a socialist pan-Arab (non-religious; all religions were accepted).   The Soviets armed the fuck out of Saddam.

In the 1980's Saddam told Russia to go fuck off, because Iran had become more or less a Soviet ally (though Iran still used their old western weapons from before the 1979 revolution).  Iran tried to take the Shat-al-arab waterway; and also tried to re-ignite sectarian hatred between Shias and Sunnis in Iraq, which Saddam had locked down (though to be fair, Saddam's party was leaning towards favoritism towards Sunnis).  So because Iraq and Iran were at war, and because the US really fucking hated Iran after the hostage crisis, the US did arm Saddam. Though not nearly to the degree you'd think: because Saddam had mostly warsaw-pact weapons. It was more of an alliance of convenience because they were fighting Iran (and Iraq were not the aggressors).

Famously, Donald Rumsfeld allowed chemical weapon precursors to be sent to Iraq for Saddam's chemical warfare program, which was wielded against Iran and Kurds.

Most of the fossil fuel profit for Russia is from oil, like 60-75% or so can't remember exact ratio, so getting rid of that within this year for a leading world economy, isn't that good? Are we on purpose not looking on other EU countries who can't afford to switch anyway and will keep funding Russia in any case. Germany had like 50% renewable energy already, and 20% was gas, and half of it was from Russia. So they even did diversify, more than others..., just if you have a massive economy it still outranks most others, that is the problem. By having such an big and export focused economy you make yourself vulnerable to conflicts and instability events like this one. I'm just saying adaption takes time with big economies, especially if it's run by a democracy and not a dictator who could just decide directly.

I think Russia is done already, they are paying a lot for their little adventure in Ukraine, the world though is expecting too much to happen at once, the war and sanctions take their time, Russia can't be forced to stop so fast so easily. The human loss is bad, but in ww2 you had a million deaths each month on average - we are at maybe 50-100k now in 3 months? It could be way worse, easy for me to say ofc, but it's the reality... At this point preventing this absurd nuclear escalation is the only thing we should be worried about, a slow defeat of Russia with more instability and potential regime change is probably perceived as better than ending this war as fast as possible, then they could focus on their economy more again and maybe become more stable again and stay in control... You can debate which approach is more human. I would like to see a ""modern"" more democratic Russia more than seeing this war end fast, if that would be a question.
