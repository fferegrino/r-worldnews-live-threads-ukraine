Those civilian medical staff have shared it with a regional milblogger from Volvovakha:

^(*bracketed part added by me for clarity*)


> ***Moods among the occupiers***

> According to patriotic citizens of Ukraine‚Äîwho are in the rear with the Russian troops‚Äîinformation was received on some aspects of the situation in the camp of Russian troops in the Liman direction. Also, in a hospital in the Luhansk region (deliberately not indicated), lightly-wounded Russian soldiers shared their views on what is currently happening on the front line. 

[RF soldier in hospital perplexed:]

> So, a Russian soldier named Vityukha said that on March 24, in their sector (somewhere near Yagodny) [just north of Bakhmut], the Russians fell under the attack of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. He got off lightly, but two of their DRGs were completely destroyed. 

> > *""One group of intelligence officers were taken out in KAMaze; another group, the paratroopers, came under direct aerial attack.""*

> Here the Armed Forces directly covered them; But he doesn‚Äôt know how many died, since he himself was wounded at the same time. But moreover, he doesn‚Äôt understand what is happening at the front:

> > *""There was a trend on television that Russian troops took Yahidnye, but our positions were covered precisely* ***from*** *Yahidnye. How shoud I understand this?""*

[Second RF soldier had a different tale of chaos:]

> But another wounded man, ""Matros,"" was very glad that he was not in [combat] positions now. 

> > *""They have a full star near Svatovo [top brass has descended to the base.]  A bunch of colonels and generals from all sorts of services came, one more terrible than the other. Checks go one after another. All commanders seem to be under arrest.*

> > *All this is due to the fact that a few days ago, when there was heavy fog, one fighter was captured by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. That's for sure, because after interrogations he was given the opportunity to contact his wife.""*

> But the whole trouble is that

> > *""his father is the rector of some military academy, and his mother serves in the FSB!  The FSB‚Äîthrough his wife‚Äîcontacted the Armed Forces of Ukraine and are negotiating to pull out this ""son,"" although no one is jealous of him. Intelligence has established that* ***that fighter surrendered all positions to the Ukrainians, and now not only the planned offensive is under threat, but also all positions on the defense line. Now they don‚Äôt know at the top whether to advance or retreat!***

> > *No one wants to take responsibility, and the soldiers hide away from numerous inspectors, since they have to hang around ‚Äòin armor‚Äô all day.""*

> As you can see, there are two big differences between what is being broadcast from the Kremlin and what is really happening on the front line. The general mood in the Russian troops is that no one wants to fight. They begin to realize that the war is actually lost. They are not liberators, as they were convinced from the Kremlin. They are invaders in a foreign land.

Russia is sending a delegation to North Korea to offer food in exchange for weapons, US national security spokesperson John Kirby has said.

Mr Kirby said any arms deal between North Korea and Russia would violate UN Security Council resolutions.

The US has previously accused North Korea of supplying arms to the Russian military in Ukraine and the Wagner group of Russia mercenaries.

Pyongyang earlier denied the claims.

Mr Kirby told a news conference the US had new information about a deal.

""We also understand that Russia is seeking to send a delegation in North Korea and that Russia is offering North Korea food in exchange for munitions,"" he said.

The security spokesperson said the US was monitoring the situation, and the alleged deal, closely.

He‚Äôs mentioned where specific equipment and Russian soldiers are, how many, when they‚Äôre rotated, who is on pause and how long. However, Ukrainian national press do not quote him‚Äîwhich gives me pause. So, salt grain here. . .*)


> ***On the advance of the Russians.***

[‚Ä¶] 

> So, in the last 3-4 days, there‚Äôs been talk amongst the military personnel of the Russian army‚Äînot only in the front-line settlements in the north of the Lugansk region, but even in Donetsk‚Äîthat in the 30 March - 04 April period, **the Russians will attempt to launch an offensive in the Kupyansk-Svatovo-Kremenna area**.  (No one knows for sure, but judging by the intensity of Russian troops in the north of the Lugansk region, it *is* quite possible.). It should also be taken into account that the Russian camp has long said that they need to ‚Äòget ahead of‚Äô the Armed Forces of Ukraine and start their offensive a few days earlier than the Armed Forces of Ukraine, in order to frustrate our plans. (I wonder how they know the exact date of our offensive?)

> Open sources say that the enemy tries to conduct assault operations in the direction of Kupyansk and Liman daily, but receives a fitting rebuff from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  The enemy systematically shells the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and also our rear settlements of Kupyansk, Dvurechnaya, Petropavlovka, Kislovka, Kolodeznoye, Zapadnoye, Stelmahovka, Nevskoye, Kuzmino, Belogorovka, Kolodezi, Spornoye and others.

> However, **based on the intensity** of the ongoing **deliveries** of Russian **equipment** and **personnel** to that direction (the main supply route for Russian troops: [Belolutsk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Biloluts'k,+Luhansk+Oblast,+Ukraine,+92322/@49.6373605,39.0120834,10.43z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x412199db99c60ca3:0x59251cb5ab9df1bc!8m2!3d49.7043697!4d39.0184047!16s%2Fg%2F120pt910?hl=en-us) - Novopskov - [Starobelsk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Starobil's'k,+Luhansk+Oblast,+Ukraine,+92701/@49.277565,38.9241176,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x41203315437a3e61:0x8457e49c8bc7a997!8m2!3d49.2736853!4d38.9255483!16zL20vMDJtbDlz?hl=en-us)), then the enemy really ***is*** preparing for an offensive, ***or*** the Armed Forces of Ukraine is just going to be disposing of Russian reserves swiftly. For example, recently, about **300 units of military equipment pass *daily* along the route.**

*Specifics:*

> The local population notes that the Russians bring all the same that they brought back in autumn and winter, but there are slightly fewer tanks (2, T-64) and other armored vehicles (5 MT-LB, 2 armored personnel carriers, 1 air defense system, 1 howitzer). There are a lot of different types of vehicles (150), including armored vehicles and various pickups and jeeps (up to 50), which the Russians use for assault and maneuver operations. Most of the rides are of cargo tented vehicles, obviously for ammunition. They also carry pontoons, both on platforms and on cars* [unclear in means rails cars or if mean ‚Äòflatbed trucks‚Äô], which may indicate preparations for overcoming water barriers. Finally, buses (8-10), which are usually used to transport personnel. 

> Note that this route is the main logistics hub of the Russians, which *should have* been eliminated a long time ago. And also, **these periodic ""leaks"" about the impending offensive of the Russians may have a goal: to pin down our forces in that direction and divert attention from the area where the offensive is** ***really*** **being prepared**. Where, sources can vary, of course. But we hope that the Armed Forces of Ukraine know which one exactly, and are ready for it.",1680233436.0,1680232959.0,t3_126azkd,t3_126azkd,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

In WW2, neutral countries that received combatants did indeed either host them for the duration or return them to their home nation on the condition that they do not re-enter the conflict.  But this was only done to protect the country's neutrality.

Europe is not neutral in this conflict.  Countries that openly send military aid to Ukraine have no allusions of neutrality.  They're absolutely free to receive the wounded and return them to Ukraine to re-enter the conflict if they so choose.

Tank guns are so big that they have relatively fewer shots... fewer but more powerful / penetrating shots. Enemy tanks are some of the only targets where the bigger gun actually matters. There are also concrete bunkers where the 125mm cannon could be useful.

For everything else, you'd rather use an M2 Bradley 25mm cannon. It shoots faster, it holds more ammo, its cheaper per shot and still quite deadly. M2 Bradley is still immune to small arms fire as well. The only reason to have the thick armor of a tank is to survive things like... well... 125mm cannons.

So the joke, and its somewhat true, is that tanks are primarily designed to kill enemy tanks. For almost every other combat situation, you kinda prefer the M2 Bradley.",False,1680156858.0,t3_126azkd,t1_je8o3s7,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

First, the Russians aren't encircled at Bakhmut. If the Ukrainians could manage to do that with their counter-offensive, and take a huge number of prisoners, it would be an unrecoverable loss for the invaders.

Second, Stalingrad was the beginning of the end for Germany on the Eastern Front, but it took almost two years more of grinding attrition and slow retreat before the situation completely fell apart for the Germans. And even at that point, it was partly due to stripping their positions of units facing the Soviets and sending them on the attack in the Ardennes. In an operation that stood zero chance of achieving its goals.

It will be demoralizing as hell for the Russians, to fail to take even Bakhmut, and then be forced back even further by a Ukrainian counter-offensive.

But to pull this off requires a well-coordinated combined arms operation, with the right equipment, people, and training. It is one of the most, if not the most difficult military operation to pull off. But if you have everything in place, and maybe with a little bit of luck, it can be done.

If you can pull it off, now you're flying past all those dug in positions, flanking and cutting them off. Because you're not giving them time to reposition and dig back in after you blow through the first key sections. You can also combine this with a shock attack (against command control, communications) to multiply the effects of confusion and panic in the enemy forces. That means some of those hunkered down defensive groups won't know you're coming until you're already right on top of them and have started slaughtering them.

Similarly, the Patriot system that Ukraine will be getting, great AD system, especially when it's used within the type of air defense network that the US uses it. Ukraine won't be getting that network, just the battery, it means that the system will be less effective by this limitation. Still good, still useful, still helpful, just not as good as when those systems are used by NATO.

F16s may not give Ukraine air superiority over the skies in the battlefield - SEAD is difficult, and requires lots of experience, the type of experience that only the US has it. However modern western jets will expand the type of weapons Ukraine could use against Russia, this is a common complaint from Ukrainian pilots, that Russia pilots can engage from further than what Ukrainian pilots can do it, so they are a inherent disadvantage when trying to engage Russian pilots, F16s would have weapons that would change that picture.

Edit: just realized I didn't answer your question:

They probably require a better radar system, but there's no physical reason they can't be detected. You might need a multiple sensor approach to detection for very small targets; statistically your signal to noise ratio improves with the square root of the number of data points you have (if I remember, right), so future defenses might integrate multiple radars combined with IRST and optical detection systems and possibly machine learning algorithms to get useful detection rates.

What I'm taking away is less opining and more synthesizing.

Taking in the constructive feedback:

* Adding context to a tweet based on everything I've read or filling in assumed knowledge unmentioned in the tweet: good mod! ( :D )
* Adding pithy comments or jabs: die, you fool! ( D: )

\---

I will say the comment about ""We‚Äôll see what happens in reality‚Ä¶"" was an acknowledgment that Russia's government has fully embraced a weaponized post-modernism AKA the words communicated are divorced of their conveyed meaning and used solely to manipulate readers perception. (Miss me with ""bu-bu-but that's all government/corporate communication!"" It's not.)

With that specific tweet, Russia's declaring it would 8x-10x ammunition production struck me as a clear attempt to refute the uptick in news this week of purchased/produced ammo from German, Norwegian, Romanian, French, and US while also talking a big game in light of ever more damaging sanctions.

In typing this out and reflecting on your suggestion some more, maybe adding what I shared above (edited down for smart brevity, ofc) rather than the original comment would of been better received.

I know you note this in your qualifying sentence above, but it really needs to be highlighted. Ukraine's actual population inside its borders today is probably closer to 30 million. Russia's nearing about 4x Ukraine's population, and as the casualties mount on both sides, Ukraine is the side that feels that constraint the most.

What can help Ukraine weather this storm, of course, is the fact that the West is propping up their civilian economy. But again, that only works while the West is throwing money, service expertise, and equipment at them. If the spigot winds down or shuts off unexpectedly because of a few big nation electoral swings, Ukraine's military and economy will be in for some serious shock.

None of this is to say that Russia can easily outlast Ukraine, or even that they are better situated to do it. Those answers depend on domestic issues that neither country has been forced to confront yet. Russia might make itself vulnerable to a revolution. Or Putin could die. Or a few larger-scale unit mutinies on the front line could swing something big against Russia's domestic stability. There could end up being smaller half-measures like a protest movement against mobilization. We don't *actually* know if Russia or its leaders have the political capability or willpower to mobilize like they'd have to if they want to outlast Ukraine.

Still, Zeihan's starting assumption is that Russian leadership views this war as a necessary existential crisis that they *have* to come out on top of, and that's an assumption that lots of the more credible analysts happen to share. This means that we probably are not anywhere near the bottom of Russia's mobilization efforts. They probably are in this fight for another two years at least, so Ukraine either needs to shock away Russian internal stability with some catastrophically one-sided offensives, or they will need to have a guaranteed, continuing supply of Western aid for the next 3-4 years. There *are* lots of good-faith reasons to be pessimistic for Ukraine's long-term chances to keep all of its territory.

All of that said, I think Zeihan himself is a blustery blowhard who says what will get him noticed. It's not lost on me that he has been quiet in the news sphere for several years. His normal wolf-crying about how China is just another 5 years away from a ""guaranteed"" collapse kind of sputtered out in the mid 2010s.

I think we're going to see defenses layered, somewhat similar to aircraft defense but at a smaller scale. 

Outer perimeter is hunter-killer drones scouting for inbounds. I think they need the look-down radar to catch the inbounds so we could see permanent tethered aerostat stations around significant targets. 

Closer to to the actual target is terminal defense. Probably guns like you mentioned. But that only works where it's not really built up. 

I think we'll probably see lasers used for the really close in defense where you don't want to add your own defensive fire to the list of damages caused. 

There would also be scale of defense. The slaughterbots from that youtube video are small but could absolutely kill individuals and don't seem too scifi these days. But smaller defenses could work against them, metal mesh barriers, certainly lasers to fry electronics. You don't need to blast it out of the air, just destroy the sensors. 

The attack vectors could be crazy. Like we think of the danger of a large drone coming into the target zone, we think what if it drops smaller drones as sub-munitions but what if those small drones enter in a delivery van instead? And it's plausible to imagine drones maneuvering through buildings. 

I'll link the slaughterbot video. This does not seem too far way technically.

https://www.nps.gov/perl/learn/historyculture/civilian-casualties.htm

> Perhaps the most tragic civilian casualties come from those killed by ""friendly fire."" Many of the 5-inch anti-aircraft rounds fired at the Japanese aircraft did not detonate properly and landed in civilian areas around Pearl Harbor and Honolulu, exploding on contact with the ground. 

That's still likely better than allowing a drone or cruise missile to hit something important but the friendly fire cost is often ignored. I don't have a citation but I remember reading the British command agonized over if it was better to shoot down the German rockets or let them hit since they were so inaccurate anyway.

Because conquest *is* the goal.  It's just easier to do in tiny pieces, when nobody goes investigating the gunshots in the night.  One detention and execution at a time.

Those ""proposals"" were non-starters, and if Ukraine did somehow agree to them, Putin would have come back with even worse ones.  It was simply time for Russia to take over Ukraine... if Putin delayed any longer, Ukraine was getting too close to acquiring allies that could actually stand up to Russia.",False,1680217305.0,t3_126azkd,t1_jec0gvh,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

I'd argue that he *is* conquering Belarus, just very slowly.  With Ukraine it needed to be a smash and grab before the world had a chance to react.  With Belarus, it's a slow digestion to keep the world from *noticing*.
