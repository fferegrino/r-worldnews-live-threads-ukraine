Ukrainian MOD's tentative identification of the POW as Tymofii Shadura was mainly sourced to Shadura's own regiment, which MOD accompanied with ""final identification pending"". Most English-language sources dismissed that asterisk. 

There is however increasingly more evidence that the serviceman is actually Oleksandr Macziyevsky (also transliterated as Matsievsky). His tentative ID was first published just a few hours after Shadura's on March 7th. First reported by well-known Yuri Butusov, [Macziyevsky is even photographed](https://glavcom.ua/columns/yuriybutusov/oleksandr-matsijevskij-heroja-jakoho-rozstriljali-rosijani-opiznano-912887.html) with the same bandage over his eyebrow that is seen in the execution video. 

> According to the Sever Territorial Defense Forces Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on December 30, 2022, Macziyevsky, together with four comrades, fought a superior Russian force near Soledar. Communication with them was lost, and reinforcements could not get to them due to heavy fire.
> 
> Further details of this battle are unknown: in particular, how exactly Macziyevsky ended up in captivity. His comrades are still missing. Oleksandr Macziyevsky was recognized by his mother, son, and other military personnel of his unit. TV channel ""Suspilne"" published a [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzChPuEGN2w) with the mother of the deceased soldier.
> 
> Prior to the Russian invasion, Macziyevsky worked as an electrician in Kyiv. After the start of the war he volunteered for the territorial defense of Nizhyn, Chernihiv region. Macziyevsky's body was handed over to the family as part of the exchange of the dead between Russia and Ukraine. Relatives identified him in the morgue in Kyiv.

This appears to be the final identification that MOD was waiting for. They were reportedly able to match the wounds on Macziyevsky's repatriated body with the video.

Edit: I'd exclude Poland from the list of countries with submarines in this regard. They technically still have a single kilo class sub, but it's in a desastrous state.



Additional edit: The russians also only have one kilo class in their baltic fleet (according to wikipedia at least), but I remember their new crown jewel, the Belgorod[for reference](https://esut.de/2022/07/meldungen/35487/russland-stellt-atom-u-boot-belgorod-in-dienst/), passing through the Baltic not so long ago.

>The aircraft was almost certainly attacked by a small uncrewed air system.

>The MAINSTAY has likely now been moved to a repair facility at Taganrog in Russia. The transit flight reportedly took place at a lower than usual altitude, likely because of damage to the pressurised cabin.

>The MAINSTAY was likely providing situational awareness for MiG-31K FOXHOUND D fighter aircraft modified to launch the AS-24 KILLJOY air launched ballistic missile which Russia sees as a key strategic capability.

>The modification saw the jets‚Äô internal radar removed to balance the airframe, making pilots reliant on external sources of situational awareness, such as MAINSTAY.

Second, we need to consider that Ukraine has very tight control over military communications.  While civilians and media will likely give coverage of damage to civilians and civilian-infrastructure (and even then, vaguely in order not to help Russia improve targeting), we get almost no coverage of damage to military targets.  

Another issue is that we don't know what Russia was aiming for, so we don't know whether it hit, or not. Ukraine likely has a very good idea, because they  know what was hit and what was nearby - both at the time of impact and the likely time of trajectory programming... some of the missiles are probably very precise and undoubtedly many have hit precisely the spot they were aiming at.  Others likely missed wildly, but it's very likely some (a fraction ranging from many to most) were aimed at military targets and happened to hit civilian buildings, most specifically high-rise buildings that the route-planners didn't expect to be there, e.g. if they are working off old maps, or if the missile zigs when it should have zagged.

Resources are an important point to Putin. He's hoping that they'll run out of ammo, equipment and people. He's hoping that the rest of the world won't be able to restock Ukraine's resources in time.  

American intelligence thinks that Putin wants to drag the war out for a long time interspersed with lulls where Russia restocks and resupplies, preparing for their next move. He thinks that in such a scenario time will be on his side.  

He's probably hoping for a number of things to happen over a long time.  

- Firstly, that a different American president will not want to help Ukraine.  

- He's hoping that support in the west will falter should America end up with a president who doesn't want to help Ukraine.  

- He's hoping that people will turn their attention inwards to their own problems rather than outwards towards Putin. He may try and accelerate this with fomenting strife in our societies by exploiting our various already existing problems.  

- He may hope that a crisis, such as a global grain shortage and/or fossil fuel shortages, will cause people to demand they are put first which could cause problems in a number of areas. It may force southern nations to side with China (who they depend upon for investments as their budgets cannot otherwise cope) in UN votes. It may cause different political parties in various nations to come to power which may not support Ukraine.

Even if Russia would make peace with Ukraine today, throws Putin out of a window, and totally changes its policies, it would take decades to rebuild the trust they have maliciously destroyed. By then, we most likely don't need fossil fuels anymore.

I'll quote a couple bits from that Wikipedia article:  
>The Russian foreign agent law[a] requires anyone who receives ""support"" from outside Russia or is under ""influence"" from outside Russia to register and declare themselves as ""foreign agents"".[1] Once registered, they are subject to additional audits and are obliged to mark all their publications with a 24-word disclaimer saying that they are being distributed by a ""foreign agent"".[2] The phrase ""foreign agent"" (Russian: –∏–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∞–≥–µ–Ω—Ç) in Russian has strong associations with Cold War-era espionage. The law has been heavily criticized both in Russia and internationally as violating human rights, and as a tool used to suppress civil society and press freedom within Russia, particularly groups opposed to Vladimir Putin.[3][4][5][6]  

And a bit further on it continues:  
>At first, the law applied to NGOs receiving funds from abroad that engaged in ""political activity"". The ""foreign agent"" designation was first imposed against media organisations in 2017.[15] In December 2019, Putin signed an expansion of the legislation to include private individuals or groups receiving any amount of foreign funding which published ""printed, audio, audio visual or other reports and materials"".[16] In September 2021, the law was expanded to include Russian citizens who report or share information on crime, corruption or other problems related to the military, space and security services or their employees.[17][18]

Just because Russia says 'we have Bakhmut encircled' doesn't make it true, or indeed 'effectively' so.

You'll notice in all the articles it's often 'analysts' saying 'Zelenskyy may' or something to that effect. Most analysts worth their weight wouldn't want to put their name to such a statement without evidence. And there is no clear evidence of it.

This is despite there being many analysts that could illustrate why it's worth holding.

Let me give you some basic examples:

1. When you encircle the enemy you also expose yourself more to the enemy. If you haven't encircled the enemy effectively and capitalised on it (Russia hasn't, Bakhmut still isn't completely surrounded) - this gives the other side some really good opportunities to punish you. This is probably true in Bakhmut.

2. When you conduct offensives heavy on manpower, light on equipment (vehicles, tanks), casualty rates skyrocket. This is definitely true for Bakhmut.

3. When you have fire control over enemy lines of supply, it also puts your fire support at risk from the enemy. Ukraine has an advantage in range and precision, this is probably true in Bakhmut.

4. If taking a location/place becomes necessary politically rather than militarily, it will keep being more and more important if failure is ongoing. This is very true for Russia right now. Because of this overinvestment it becomes easier for Ukraine to bleed Russia.

5. There could be some crucial reasons to keep the front away from centres further back, it could be electricity generation, a military buildup or capability reason, the risk of higher civilian casualties. The sorts of reasons that people half a world away don't know because we don't have all the information. Potentially true for Bakhmut.

TLDR; I wouldn't buy into any speculative hype, particularly when it's divisive. There's every chance that Russia started this narrative. Hell it could even be an information battlespace or deception effort by Ukraine.",False,1678399173.0,t3_11miio8,t1_jbkjv4v,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy privately told a lawmaker that he didn't know his picture would be taken with former President Donald Trump during his visit to Mar-a-Lago just weeks after the Capitol riot, according to a new book.

""I didn't know they were going to take a picture,"" McCarthy reportedly told an unnamed colleague, according to ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future."" The New York Times on Thursday reported new excerpts from the forthcoming book that will be published on May 3.

**Terrorism Induced Sanctions against Iran:**

A ban on arms-related exports and sales.

Controls over exports of dual-use items, requiring 30-day Congressional notification for goods or services that could significantly enhance the terrorist-list country's military capability or ability to support terrorism.

Prohibitions on economic assistance.

Imposition of miscellaneous financial and other restrictions, including:
Requiring the United States to oppose loans by the World Bank and other international financial institutions;
Lifting diplomatic immunity to allow families of terrorist victims to file civil lawsuits in U.S. courts;
Denying companies and individuals tax credits for income earned in terrorist-listed countries;
Denial of duty-free treatment of goods exported to the United States;
Authority to prohibit any U.S. citizen from engaging in a financial transaction with a terrorist-list government without a Treasury Department license; and
Prohibition of Defense Department contracts above $100,000 with companies controlled by terrorist-list states.


From January 2016, Iran was included in a separate exclusion the Visa Waiver Program. The (VWP) does not apply where a person has previously traveled to these countries on or after 1 March 2011 or for those who remain nationals of those countries in addition to the nationality that would otherwise entitle them to a visa waiver. Instead, they are now required to go through the process to obtain a visa.[34] 

Certain categories such as diplomats, military, journalists, humanitarian workers or legitimate businessmen may have their visa requirement waived by the Secretary of Homeland Security.


Under the Trump administration, citizens of these countries faced partial entry restrictions to the United States under Presidential Proclamation 9645 of the Executive Order 13780. The order was in force from 2017 until its revocation in 2021.

Entry of all Iranian nationals into the United States as immigrant and non-immigrant are currently suspended unless they have valid student visas (F, M-1, and M-2 visas) .",1678394230.0,1678393947.0,t3_11miio8,t1_jbl2obp,,2,23,0,23,0,0,

I remember someone explaining the basics of how the human mind tests statements for truth/false.  

Initially the statement to be tested enters our minds in a state of truth. Then the statement is tested and marked as false as required.  

That process can be short-circuited by overloading our minds with too much information too quickly. It causes the statements to not complete the test phase and they're left in the truth state. Over time that can really wear down a persons mind.  

It's way more complicated than that though and there are other factors involved, such as how much we trust the source of the information, if it is from a friend, family member or other source we may look up to as authoritative, etc. That's part of the reason why so much propaganda and lies spread through networks of friends and families on Facebook and Twitter.  

There's also the fact that some people *want* something to be true so badly that it clouds their judgement.

On the subject of domestic...we don't see how brainwashed the people there really are. The fact is that Wagner contributed more to the Ukraine war than the actual army.

Russian logistics run on a push-forward system, where ammo and other supplies are allocated from the logistics centers based on commands from higher up, and then sent ahead on trains to their destination. The frontline units can send requests for supplies but it is up to the guys at the back to allocate based on the orders from the upper ranks. This has an advantage in that supplies are always moving forward to the front, but has the disadvantage that supplies don't always go where they need to be (the OODA loop between unit requesting supplies-> command authorizing supplies -> logistics shipping supplies) and its easy to nick or redirect or just lose supplies when they reach the forward depots.

The system functions for the Russians because the machine is nonstop pushing supplies forward as long as the commanders are signing off on it, and it will *eventually* get to the front no matter what so someone will get them. But it also allows commanders to easily choke off or load up units if they wish, and errors or interdiction of supply dumps can leave units high and dry without ammo. It works with a system of strict top-down command like that of the Russian military. If an individual unit gets left low on ammo, that doesn't stop the whole offensive.

Compare with Western style logistics, where individual units can make requests and get supplied directly from logistics centers as needed, since the units tend to be more independent and able to make calls on what they need without a high-level commander's approval (and US logistics is basically a cheat code by this point because how hard we beefed up our supply systems). Supplies aren't pouring down the routes but it is much harder for a unit to get cut off due to a gaffe somewhere in the supply approval process. US soldiers won't be sending videos directly to the President begging for ammo because unlike in Russia, the American President doesn't enforce direct control over which oligarch's private army gets fed.",1678395339.0,1678394048.0,t3_11miio8,t1_jbkigs0,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The following acts are examples of perfidy:

>(a) the feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of a surrender;

>(b) the feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;

>(c) the feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and

>(d) the feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties to the conflict.

> Ruses of war are not prohibited. Such ruses are acts that are intended to mislead an adversary or to induce him to act recklessly but which infringe no rule of international law applicable in armed conflict and which are not perfidious because they do not invite the confidence of an adversary with respect to protection under that law. The following are examples of such ruses: the use of camouflage, decoys, mock operations and misinformation.

Norway could be said to have a reason since they've made massive profits off of oil exports since the pipeline was destroyed, but the pipeline was transporting natural gas, not oil, and the two aren't immediately interchangeable.

They could easily have sent a charge through the pipeline to blow it up when convenient without having a ship in the area to take the blame.  They also had a very good reason.

Essentially the working idea is: ""Keep you enemies close.""

It sucks because their presence actively works against the effectiveness of the organization, but removing them also works against the effectiveness of the organization. A rock and a hard place. 

The SC is the refinement of the GA, and is reserved for major players. Whether Russia really belongs there is disputable, and they aren't as major as they once were, but the permanent members of the SC were the forces that won WWII ‚Äî¬†the impetus for the original formation of the UN.

This isn't about optics on a tank. The artillery and drones on both sides outrange the line of sight of the best tanks on Earth. Ukraine can only conduct maneuver warfare when it has enough mobile artillery to suppress the enemy defending artillery, something that tanks have no power to do. This is the whole reason that Western commanders and observers have not been chomping at the bit to get tanks to Ukraine. Without air supremacy, the maneuverability of Ukrainian tank formations requires way more mobile artillery and ammunition than the West has on hand. It's a chokepoint that has been curbing the value of Western tanks and limiting them to a few small Western tank battalions.

It finally looks like Ukraine is developing a critical mass of SPART and SPAA, but it's taken a long time to get all those systems.

Sure, the Abrams has mine rollers. So do Soviet tanks. They got used now and then in the grinding assault on the Kherson salient, and Russian grad rockets pummeled the crap out of those vehicles. It does not matter what vehicle you are driving - mine fields simply take too long to breach when you are under active artillery bombardment.

Look at the battle of H√ºrtgen Forest in Germany. We‚Äôre talking about 55000 lives lost in total, with companies being completely decimated on a daily basis over a period of months, the US First army had to be revamped. 

To your second part again I disagree. Ill speak on doctrine thats openly available, when it comes to the defense and EA DEV(Area of engagement development) Step 4 is plan and integrate obstacles(in this cause mine field) step 6 is integrate indirect fires. This is straight up doctrine on how the US trains and how most NATO allies have done it also. We KNOW there is going to be fire on the obstacle, thats why a breach is a deliberate action. 

Lets use platoons as an example, if the 3 is your breach tank and he goes down the two tank knows it needs to push that shit through. If the two tank goes down then counter battery is already firing on that initial artillery and the next tank is up to push through. Deliberately spaced out, understanding beforehand what your role is for the mission, and executing with audacity.",False,1678420183.0,t3_11miio8,t1_jbmph3y,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

If that's what happens every time a tank battalion withdraws and counter attacks, you'd be out of tanks in just a few short months of defending a small patch of front. You can do that for an offensive operation, but Ukraine has to also do that when it counterattacks in small tactical engagements. It's unsustainable and is why Ukraine doesn't use tanks that way.

And the counter battery fire... This is part of the whole problem. Ukraine needs hundreds of SPART if it's going to do this just for a few limited tank brigades. To defend Bakhmut, Kremina and Vuhledar in the manner you describe would require thousands of mobile artillery systems.",False,1678421199.0,t3_11miio8,t1_jbmrqui,,2,1,0,1,0,0,
