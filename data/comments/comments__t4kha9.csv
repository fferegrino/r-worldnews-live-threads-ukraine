Day 6 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

When you think it can‚Äôt get any worse it always gets worse, with each passing day more people are dying and our beautiful city gets destroyed even more, what the fuck are they doing?

Our previous mayor Hennadiy Kernes really loved our city and was always renovating it, and now it‚Äôs being destroyed. He saved us from becoming another russian puppet region in 2014, he even survived being shot from sniper rifle in an assassination attempt in the same year but became crippled, and continued to govern our city, he was widely loved and people mourned him after he died 2 years ago. He was also Jewish but if he were alive right now russians would definitely call him a nazi, after all everyone here is a nazi.

Don‚Äôt get any ideas that just because most people here speak russian they would welcome russian army, after destroying our historic city and killing our people EVERYONE here is absolutely furious and curses Putin and russian people as a whole. These fucking russian demons even bombed our new zoo and killed some innocent animals in the first day of the war, what the fuck did the animals do to them?

Even if for some reason they occupy us they will be met with people that hate their very existence and want them dead. I know this from standing with people in queues to stores for hours in the past couple of days and listening to them talk, NOBODY here wants to be ‚Äúliberated‚Äù, but instead everyone here who was pro-russian before - now despises russians and there‚Äôs no way back anymore, there‚Äôs no forgiveness after what they have done.

Just 3 hours ago we were bombed from fighter jets for fuck sake, 3 of them flew just above my building extremely close to the ground and their air pressure triggered alarms in cars standing in the streets, the fear they inflict is even worse than the one from shelling, the bombs they carry are much more destructive. This whole situation seems like a real life nightmare, but the one you can‚Äôt wake up from.

We won‚Äôt know the full extent of today‚Äôs destruction until tomorrow, but so far it seems horrific, the whole city shook from these explosions, one of them even made a big mushroom cloud.

>Today is the sixth day that, on the main page of Yandex, at least 30 million russians are seeing that there is no war, that there are not thousands of dead Russian soldiers, that there are not dozens of civilians killed by Russian bombing, that there are not dozens of prisoners, that there is not huge destruction in various Ukrainian cities.

>The fact that a huge amount of the Russian population may believe there is no war is the basis and driving force of this war. Today, Yandex is a key element in hiding information about the war. Every day and hour of such ""news"" costs human lives. And you, my former colleagues, are also responsible for this.

>There are no Russian Laws that forbid choosing Novaya Gazeta as the headline of a topic. There is no criminal liability if headlines of Russian-language media that do not have a media license appear on the main Yandex page. There is no criminal liability for the service being ""broken"" or ""hacked"". 

>Any costs you may face are not comparable to the harm that the service has been causing every day since the start of the war.

>It's not too late to stop being accomplices to a terrible crime. If you can't do anything, quit.

>Remember, you're not only responsible to thousands of your colleagues, but also tens of millions of your users. And in front of millions of Ukrainians too.

Don't even get me started on that. It has the same engines as the Su-35 (a Su-27 derivative). Engines are very important on a stealth plane as exhaust ripples make the radar profile of the plane larger. You can't hear the B-2 coming until it's gone. The engines are internally mounted to avoid air disturbances  as much as possible. The F-22 has stealth thrust vectoring nozzles. The F-35 has been criticized for not having more stealth regarding it's engine. The Su-57? Just slap some old engines on there. We don't know how stealthy the material is on the plane but given what we've seen of the rest of Russia's military? I'd say it's bad. Probably just another cash cow for the Oligarchs.

Each of the 4 operational commands are essentially the same in size, with the East carrying an additional brigade because of the pre-invasion conflict there. They all carry their own logistics, signal, battery, and C&C regiments. ([source](https://youtu.be/U26SNwTH8p0)).

With the influx of nationals returning to volunteer rumored to be 80,000 strong, and the newly formed foreign legion also to generate impressive numbers, you‚Äôd think both of those would be rolled out into OC E and OC N respectively. If those numbers constitute ~100,000 fighters then that increases UA manpower significantly. 33% increase over pre-war army strength, but no idea how that looks now that so many citizens have taken up arms. 

So I don‚Äôt doubt their ability to maintain a corridor from Kyiv to Lviv to retreat into. At some point if the fighting within Kyiv takes them to the east side of the Dnieper then the gov‚Äôt would have no choice but to move to Lviv I‚Äôd think, if their intention is to continue to govern.

**More on how long Ukraine may withstand Russian assault**

>A U.S. official tells CBS News that a tactical seizure of Ukraine is possible within the next 4-6 weeks, based on the assessments of what is currently taking place on the ground with the Russian military. 

>As David Martin has reported, it is expected to take one week before Kyiv is surrounded, and another 30 days could elapse before Ukraine's capital is seized. This U.S. official says it is not clear whether Russia would gradually strangle the city or engage in street-to-street fighting. These scenarios were laid out for members of Congress Monday as the initial battle to destroy the Ukrainian military and government. It is also not clear whether Russia would then decide to go west toward Lviv or as far west as the Polish border.

>Given the durability of the Ukrainian resistance and its long history of pushing Russia back, the U.S. and Western powers do not believe that this will be a short war. **The U.K. foreign secretary estimated it would be a 10-year war. Lawmakers at the Capitol were told Monday it is likely to last 10, 15 or 20 years ‚Äî and that ultimately, Russia will lose**.

Early signs are that Russian commanders are abandoning the approach that marked the first days of the conflict, in which they relied on lightning strikes into cities they assumed would be half-heartedly defended, the officials said, according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.

After multiple failures, officials from the US and allied nations expect Russia to use more indiscriminate tactics to suppress resistance.

After pausing to regroup and draw new assets into place around the capital, the ISW expects Russian forces to relaunch their attack on the capital, Kyiv. The new phase is thought to play out over several days.

Officials from Ukraine‚Äôs defence ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organise a unit of hackers to defend against Russia.

On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organise hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country.

‚ÄúEverything that might stop war,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country.‚Äù

Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians.

Answers are pretty much standard. Most of them teachers and couple are workers. They where mobilized 3 days before war. They where told that they will need to go to 3 days military exercises. After that they where sent to battle.

#‚Ä¢ BRICS - Association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

The BRICS states are an association for 5 major emerging economies around the world. The aim is to deepen economic, political and cultural co-operation between the member states. 

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

_Note: BRICS association could be one reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis_

#‚Ä¢ CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Current members are: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan

Up until the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan had been granted observer status.


#‚Ä¢ UN - United Nations

#‚Ä¢ DPR (DNR) and LPR (LNR) - Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic

Are two self-proclaimed breakaway Regions in eastern Ukraine which were officially recognised as independent states by Russia on Feb 21 in the prelude to this war.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#‚Ä¢ How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#‚Ä¢ What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermobaric weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#‚Ä¢ How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the Euromaidan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/

#‚Ä¢ Ukraine signed a EU candidate application, what now? / Is Ukraine a member of the EU now?

Yesterday, Ukraine signed a historic agreement to apply for EU membership - subsequently the EU commission quickly granted candidate status to Ukraine.

But what does this mean?

First off, currently there is several countries that hold candidate status: Albania, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

EU candidate status means, that the EU is leading negotiations with each candidate in order to assess their readiness to comply with EU standards - for example, does the candidate have instutions that are strong enough to upheld the rule of law? Are they economically ready to join the eurozone?

This process can take some time, so it is anyones guess when Ukraine will officially be a member of the EU.

Mexico won't slap Russia with economic sanctions 

That's been confirmed by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who often cites a guiding principle of nonintervention in foreign affairs.

Here's what he said on that:

""We want to maintain good relations with all the world‚Äôs governments, and we want to be in a position to be able to speak with all parties to the conflict.‚Äù
Russian investment in Mexico is estimated at some $181 million and the bilateral trade at more than $3.3 billion.

Mr Lopez Obrador also rejected the censoring of some Russia media outlets.

Overnight strikes on multiple Ukrainian cities have resulted in deaths and damage to residential neighborhoods, according to reports and government sources. As my colleague Samantha Lock continues our live coverage, here‚Äôs a summary of what‚Äôs happened in the past few hours:

Ukraine is expected to be a focus of tonight‚Äôs State of the Union address in the United States, where Joe Biden will condemn ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs war‚Äù as ‚Äúpremeditated and unprovoked,‚Äù and tout the importance of NATO and American diplomacy.

At least two people were reported dead and three injured in a strike on a military base in Zhytomyr, in northwest Ukraine, which also reportedly affected nearby homes, with ten private homes damaged, and some of them on fire.

There were reports of heavy bombing in Kharkiv and strikes on residential neighborhoods in Kyiv.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund released a joint statement saying that they ‚Äústand with the Ukrainian people‚Äù and condemning the ‚Äúhorrifying‚Äù attacks they have endured. They promised hundreds of millions of dollars in rapid support to Ukraine, and billions over the next months.

The list of American companies that announced in recent hours they were suspending sales of their products or other operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine includes Apple, Nike, Ford Motor Company, and Boeing.

Apple cuts off Russian sales

Apple has stopped selling its iPhone and other popular products in Russia

The company also said its mobile app store would block downloads of RT News and Sputnik News from outside Russia.

And it stopped live traffic updates on Apple Maps in Ukraine as a safety measure, mirroring action Google has already taken.

The trendsetting Silicon Valley company disclosed its punitive measures in a statement amid worldwide outrage over Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs assault on Ukraine.

Here's a snippet from Apple's statement on the conflict:

‚ÄúWe will continue to evaluate the situation and are in communication with relevant governments on the actions we are taking.

""We join all those around the world who are calling for peace.‚Äù
It's unclear how much of Apple's annual revenue ‚Äî  roughly $502 billion ‚Äî comes from Russia.

The action from Apple comes after Ukraine's Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov wrote to the company's CEO Tim Cook asking him to block Russia's access to Apple services:

Daria Kaleniuk, Executive Director of the ""Anti-Corruption Action Centre"" interview with Sky News

""In a day or two **MILLIONS** and  **MILLIONS** of Ukrainians will have no access to food, access to medicine, will have no access to fuel. So we will be in isolation and it will be the genocide against Ukrainian people and the entire world will simply observe and will be thinking like these ""experts"" from London will be saying, 'let's think what else can we give to Putin?' 

I think the West has to stop thinking 'what else can we give to Putin. The West has to start thinking how to punish Putin and how to actually have strength to stand up and adhere to its promises."" 

[She goes on to say that was what her point to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.]

""...That Ukraine had nuclear weapons and gave them up with the promise from the U.S., UK and Russia; for the assurances that if anyone attacks us there will be a response and there will be help.

And now the U.K. is saying, 'we are not even willing to shut[down] all these missiles. We are not willing to help to protect your side[sic]. I think it's humiliating and it's a hypocrisy.""

The Reporter:  ""But what they are doing is, supplying weapons, they are imposing some of the toughest sanctions and Boris Johnson's point about the 'No Fly Zone', I mean, it could easily lead to clashes with the Russian Air Force, and who knows where that could lead in terms of a much broader war.""

Then she lays out the truth:

""Listen, I already heard this argument, a couple of weeks and a couple of months ago. That 'we are not [going to] imposing sanctions to Russia, we are not stopping Nordstream 2, because it will irritate Russia, let's give up something to Putin, let him operate, let's give him money, let's take some money from him, let's let his oligarchs who are actually war criminals to park their ""Essense"" in our luxurious mansions in Great Britain or in French Riviera. But this **led** us to the most devastating war Europe [has] had since the last 70 years. And you think that this continuous appeasement of Putin and afraidness to irritated him will prevent World War 3? Or prevent nuclear strikes? And I will say[to] you something, Ukraine has four nuclear power plants across the country. And any missile any time from Russia could hit these nuclear power plants; and this will be no more just the Ukrainian territory, it will be up in the air, flying, across entire world and first of all to Europe, to NATO states. And I am now appealing to NATO, that any missile from Russia can hit Ukrainian nuclear power plants and blow up radiation on innocent people across Europe. So NATO has to stand up and hit at least missiles. I'm not talking to hit planes, I'm talking that there has to be, immediately, invented alternative instrument to 'No Fly Zone', which has to protect Ukrainian sky. And that's FULL STOP.

It's extra ordinary times, which requires extraordinary leadership, and which requires extraordinary and quick solutions.""

Reporter: Do you think an attack on Kyiv is inevitable nowhere?

""It's happening, c'mon! What type of--what is the question? The attack on Kyiv is already happening. Their missile from Russia was trying to target the damm on Dnieper River. Ukrainian army destroyed that missile. But next time, Ukrainian army will fail to do so, and there will be water flood, killing 1 million Ukrainian people. C'mon, WAKE UP! This [is] World War 3 already happening and everyone is just observing how Ukraine is taking the heat. And applauding, 'you are so brave, Ukrainians! But we are not going to intervene.

I went to a rally at my legislature this weekend to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. I wrote my member of parliament to encourage any and all measures to punish Russia for their war crimes. My efforts to support Ukraine feel wholly and totally inadequate in light of the gravity of the situation, however. I wish there was more I could personally do to help the courageous people of Ukraine. I am sorry Ukraine‚Äôs pathway to freedom has been paved with so much suffering. It‚Äôs not fair. Yet, in the face of such violence and brutality, Ukraine‚Äôs collective and defiant spirit has inspired and brought together the free world. I am in awe of Ukraine and its people, truly.

Basically it could trigger the war between nuclear powers that everyone is trying to avoid right now.

>The Russian T-72 MBT had a fuel tank which held 1,200L (360 U.S. Gal.) which gave it an operational range of 460 km (290 mi), and with added fuel drums, up to 700 km (430 mi). That gives it and EPA fuel mileage standard of .38 km/L (.81 mpg), and with drums (2 X 200L (53 U.S. Gal.), ea.), you get .44L/km (.92mpg).

[https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-fuel-mileage-of-the-T72-MBT](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-fuel-mileage-of-the-T72-MBT)

Semi's go thru about a tenth of the fuel at idle. Assuming these tanks are sitting at idle/creep gear then you could guesstimate that they have a fuel economy of .092 MPG

a semi can idle for 6-7 days.  assuming trends continue we would be looking at around a day idle time.

There are obviously lots of parameters that can plug into this and I suck at fucking math.

TLDR: the best guesstimate I could give you would be \`100% less than a day and just going willy nilly with speculation I would imagine 5 or 6 hours between refills for the trucks in the convoys.

Once evidence establishes reasonable grounds to believe a person is responsible for an atrocity crimes, the ICC Prosecutor may request the Pre-Trial Chamber to issue a summons or arrest warrant.  
  
A summons can be issued if the Pre-Trial Chamber is satisfied that the person will appear in the courtroom, and can contain conditions sufficient to ensure the person‚Äôs appearance.  
  
An arrest warrant can be issued if the Pre-Trial Chamber believes that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure that the person appears at trial. It can also be issued if the judges think it is necessary to ensure that the person does not obstruct the investigation, or to prevent the person from continuing to commit crimes similar to those he or she is suspected of committing.

The close air support pins down the defenders with constant airstrikes, while the infantry clears buildings and calls targets and the armor deals with strong points.

With Russia, you're seeing tanks driving into kill zones completely unsupported, and helicopters flying into MANPADs with no cover from infantry machine gunners or high altitude planes, and infantry rolling into ambushes in lightly armored trucks and no air support.

For a conflict this big and cities so populated the civilian death toll is small. 
Is that a horrible thing to say? Yes. But it's true.

>it just looks like they are committing genocide and killing anyone they see

[Genocide](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml) is the systematic targeting or elimination of a group of people.
Russian military is not killing every Ukrainian. Nor are they excluding and not harming ethnic Russians.

Please don't use the word apparently please don't use the word sparingly.

What Russian is doing in ukraine is very tragic, it is not genocide.

Feel free to search some recent genocides.

I think it's a very fluid situation and everyone is making it up as they go. The number of countries that shed their neutrality regarding this conflict does speak to some semblance of unity but the ramifications of this expanding are huge. But 100% to your point, has the West already contributed too much to let Ukraine fail if this starts to go south? Sure feels that way. I almost wonder if Putin tries to force their hand in that regard. Esp if he considers these sanctions acts of war against Russia.

Russia may have messed up the invasion phase, and they may mess the whole thing up before its said and done but this ain't soccer or football and they can easily switch doctrines and have the standoff capabilities to pull it off so its dangerous to assume that the experienced Russian military is anything but dangerous as hell. If they do choose this path tho, indiscriminately killing Ukrainians, the rest of the world will be forced to act, and that may be his plan going forward.

Biden is preferable to the alternative but his weakness and cowardice on russia is sickening. He simply doesn't seem to comprehend that the threat and possibility of american military intervention is just as powerful a tool in deterring russia as actual military intervention.

The day he ruled out American military action in advance of any invasion was the day he signed Ukraine's death warrant. My brain still hurts thinking about that, why on earth would you give Putin the certainty and comfort that his invasion wouldn't provoke an american response ? If he had left even doubt around that possibility, it would have been far less likely Putin would have taken the risk.

Because he's still struggling to comprehend how quickly events and public opinion are changing I've no doubt he will give a speech which would have reflected how people felt a week ago, rule out any sort of no fly zone, again, in the state of the union and russia will take that as a signal to intensify their bombardment of Ukrainian cities because they know nothing worse will happen if they do.

Democracies ultimately must stand together or fall separately. An autocrat can rule without the will of the people and can engage in wars of conquest for his own pride and greed. Democracies typically don't do this, as they need to have the approval of their people. 

Putin seems to see himself in grandiose histrionic terms. He sees himself as another Peter the Great or Stalin, and he seeks to reform the old Russian empire. While he's currently focusing on Ukraine, it won't end with Ukraine. The same justifications he's using for the war in Ukraine could be used to justify war against Poland, the Baltic countries, or any other lands that the Russian empire once controlled. 

Ultimately, people like Putin only stop when they're forced to stop. This is the reason NATO exists. Without a unified alliance, an expansionist power like Russia can just pick off countries one by one, extinguishing democracy after democracy. 

It could very well lead to a larger war. The west doesn't want war, but the free nations of the world have to stand together or fall separately. This applies even to a nuclear power like Russia. They may have nukes, but that does not give them the right to destroy democracy after democracy. In fact, this is the exact reason democracies even have nuclear arsenals.

Nuclear deterrence makes the possibility of escalation between super powers nearly impossible without triggering mutually assured destruction. Everyone knows this and no one involved has any delusions that they would survive such a conflict. 

This predates nuclear weapons even. For instance no one used chemical weapons during WW2 because they knew that the enemy would also use it on them and not just on the battlefield but on the cities and on civilians. 

Even Hitler and Stalin, two leaders more deplorable than Putin, dreaded this outcome. Hitler literally had stockpiles of Sarin gas at his disposal that he could have used at the end of the war as a last resort but he didn‚Äôt because he knew the allies would return the favor.

Obviously in this case, NATO shooting down Russian aircraft over Ukraine leads to a general war with Russia, which means NATO subs attacking Russian naval and merchant shipping, NATO attacks on Russian military facilities, bombing Russian military, industrial and logistics targets, etc.

All of which might make Russia's political and military leadership say ""We can't win this war conventionally, but we can certainly finish it with a nuclear exchange.""

No-fly zones were imposed in Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War because in the late 80s, Saddam used helicopters and aircraft to conduct chemical weapon attacks on Kurdish areas in the north of Iraq. We already knew that he hated the Kurds in the north and the Shia in the south, so it was a precaution to protect those populations from further air attacks.

Laying aside the escalation and nuclear possibilities, no-fly zones make *zero* sense in Ukraine's case because the Russians are not using much of their airpower; most of their shelling of civilian areas is being done by long-range cruise or ballistic missiles, MLRS, artillery, and so on.

Right now things are chaotic, and a lot can change, but as time progresses, a new balance will come into being. What that balance is, and for how long it will last - is hard to say.

The sad reality that seems to be unfolding is that Putin (unsurprisingly) doubling down and is moving to siege tactics, and that the Ukrainians are (unsurprisingly) becoming more fierce and dedicated in their resistance and will not give up. The result is that the Russians are and will continue to target civilian targets and slowly grind down the Ukrainian resistance, with incredible loss of life and infrastructure as the result.

The unknown part of the equation is how Russian society will hold up in the coming weeks and months. Economically they are getting completely wrecked, which will impact the ability for the government to do things like, pay for costly wars and occupations for one thing. Secondly, there will be a test of Putin's hold on society. They are now moving to completely silence any dissent even more aggressively than before, but also here part of the reason why security forces such as police are happy to suppress a population is because they tend to be well compensated. Take away the money, take away (part of) the power. This will intrinsically destabilize Putin's position. He might survive that, he might not. Nobody can accurately predict how that's going to go at this stage.

Say he doesn't survive, then very likely Russia will retreat from Ukraine. A new leader will put the blame on Putin and will retreat while saving face. In that case, the conflict will not last decades. 

If he does survive, then there is still the question of how Ukranian resistance will go. The people there right now seem incredibly united and motivated. The shelling and bombing of civilian targets isn't going to make it any better. If you think Afghanistan was a nasty place for an occupying force, Ukraine is going to be absolute hell. NATO countries will supply an occupied Ukraine with an infinite amount of smuggled explosives and weaponry which they can use to resist the Russian occupation. Two-hundred thousand soldiers are not **ever** going to successfully control a country of 40 million pissed of people. So what, Putin is going to put more soldiers there? How is he going to pay them? Even dictators have a constituency they must please, either security forces or some form of elite that is reaping the benefits of the regime. What benefits will there be for anyone in Russia to reap? Why would anyone stay loyal to Putin, risk life and limb for hardly a reward? 

Certainly it's going to be a shitshow, unless someone stabs the fucker in the back (literally) in the coming days, but no-one can right now say the conflict will last 15-20 years with any sort of certainty.

The story could change if armed guerillas with javelins are roaming around. And change in a bad way, as they won't liberate shit, but the death toll will syrocket, making the invading army considerably more violent towards citizens.

The food in your grocery store doen't come from a factory around the corner, it comes from farms and warehouses all over the place. 

The locals know the terrain, and they have networks of people they trust with their lives; the occupiers do not. Insurgents gather in hidden places to plot attacks, carry them out, and then vanish back into the population with barely a trace.

If the insurgency is popular (and it would be very popular, in this case) the minority of insurgents doing the actual fighting will be aided in numerous ways, big and small, by the majority who are not active fighters. Ordinary people will feed fighters, hide them, move supplies for them, lie for them, engage in minor acts of sabotage and assist with major ones, etc.

It's basically a nightmare scenario for any modern military. The enemy can and will hide anywhere, and you often have no way to telling who is just going about their business and who is trying to kill you - they all hate you, even the ones who aren't part of the insurgency. Your force multipliers (tanks, artillery) are all seriously diminished in urban settings, and using them tends to piss off the locals even more. Oh, and every time you kill somebody (whether they are active insurgents or you've just accidentally killed an innocent civilian) you've made a mortal enemy out of their friends and relatives.

This is the problem with you all.  You keep making the baseless claim that the only horrible thing he did was say mean things on twitter.

That's just patently false.  Trump did massive damage to America, Democracy, the rule of law, etc..  He destroyed millions of people's lives.

Just to prove my point, everyones 2nd most hated man after Putin, Donald Trump donated just shy of 1 bln dollars worth of military aid (lethal and non lethal) to Ukraine, more than Obama and Biden put together, but he is/was considered by the media as a clown, incompetent fool etc etc.

As engine displacement increases, so does fuel consumption. A 15 liter engine (like the ones used in over the road long-haul trucks in the US & Canada) will start at 3/4 to 1 gallon per hour at idle. I do not know the engine displacement in a tank but I assume they will be 15-20 liter diesel engines, at the very least.

Military engines are NOT regulated like on highway engines so they will likely not have the same emissions control devices (which would give them better fuel economy when under way) but idle is idle. It is the worst thing for a diesel engine. Any fleet manager will tell you they try to reduce idle time whenever possible because it wastes $‚Ç¨¬£¬•. It is bad on the cylinders too. Diesel engines are efficient in that they will only* use enough fuel to meet horsepower demand. They are also much more thermally efficient than gasoline engines so in prolonged idle the in-cylinder temps can cool down enough that fuel spray will wash past the cylinders and increase fuel in oil % and ring wear.

 >The siege of Leningrad (Russian: –±–ª–æ–∫–∞–¥–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥–∞; German: Leningrader Blockade) was a prolonged military blockade undertaken from the south by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany against the Soviet city of Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on the Eastern Front in World War II. The Finnish army invaded from the north, co-operating with the Germans, and completed the ring around the city. The siege began on 8 September 1941, when the Wehrmacht severed the last road to the city. Although Soviet forces managed to open a narrow land corridor to the city on 18 January 1943, the Red Army did not lift the siege until 27 January 1944, 872 days after it began.

Not necessarily. Look what happened in World War Two. Both sides had extensive chemical weapons stockpiles, but they never used them. 

If NATO tried to invade Moscow, sure, then I would expect the conflict to go nuclear. But a slug-fest in Ukraine? Not necessarily. NATO could make its terms clear, ""we will fight to defend Ukraine and destroy Russian military forces on the ground in Ukraine or in the skies over Ukraine."" 

Russia isn't risking the destruction of their nation in this conflict.

7f26ad5a7b8f67624e4616f0ec559d6c,t4kha9,hyz7lc8,"Accomplishments of the United Nations :
During its 60+year history, the U.N. has achieved many remarkable accomplishments in fulfilling it goals.
The U.N. has peacefully negotiated 172 peace settlements that have ended regional conflicts and is
credited with participation in over 300 international treaties on topics as varied as human rights
conventions to agreements on the use of outer space and the oceans.
The U.N. has been involved in every major war and international crisis since its inception and has served
as a catalyst for the prevention of others. It authorized the international coalitions that fought in the
Korean War (1950 -53) and the Persian Gulf War (1991). It provided a forum for mediation in the Arab -
Israeli conflict resulting in numerous peace accords and keeping the conflict localized to the Middle East.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the U .N. was used as a podium by the United States to challenge
the Soviet Union‚Äôs placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The embarrassment of pub lic indictment was
instrumental in forcing the Soviets to remove the missiles. U.N. military forces (provided by member
states) have conducted over 35 peacekeeping missions providing security and reducing armed conflict . In
1988, the U.N. Peace -Keeping Forces received the Nobel Prize for Peace. The U.N. has also set up war
crimes tribunals to try war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
The U.N. has also made great strides in raising the consciousness of human rights beginning with the
‚ÄúUniversal Declaration of Human Rights‚Äù adopted by the General Assembly in 1948. The U.N. Commission
on Human Rights through its investigations and technical assistance in promoting free and fair elections
has helped many countries in the transition to democracy . The U.N.‚Äôs intense attention to specific human
rights abuses helped end apartheid i n South Africa . In its humanitarian efforts, more than 30 million
refugees fleeing war, persecution, or famine have received aid from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. The International Court of Justice has helped settle numerous international disputes involving
territorial issues, hostage -taking and economic rights.
Since the end of the Cold War, the U.N. has become increasingly involved in providing humanitaria n
assistance and promoting improvements in the health of the world‚Äôs peoples. In addition to providing
relief for humanitarian crises caused by international conflicts, the U.N. can also respond to emergencies
caused by natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. On a proactive level, t he World Health
Organization (WHO) and other U.N. affiliated groups have eliminated smallpox and are actively pursuing a
battle against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria around the world. The WHO played a significant ro le in
diagnosing and containing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. U.N.
programs, like the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF) have saved and enriched the lives of the
world‚Äôs children through immunization programs for pol io, tetanus, measles, whooping cough, diphtheria
and tuberculosis. T he lives of over 3 million children a year have been saved .
The U.N. operates under the principle that promoting economic and social development will help bring
about lasting world peace . The United Nations Development Program provides economic assistance
through expert advice, training, and limited equipment to developing countries. The U.N. Development
Program coordinates all the U.N. efforts in developing nations and has had success in part because it is
not perceived as an outside group threatening a developing countries‚Äô authority or degenerating it to
colonial rule. In addition to promoting workers rights and the right to organize and bargain for better pay
and working conditions, the U.N. has also played a significant role in improving agricultural techniques and
increasing crop yields in Asia , Africa and South America. The U.N. has also helped developing nations
obtain funding projects through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, also known
as the World Bank. A related U.N. agency, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) promotes international

I'm so over this ""could have"" idea. It obviously gave Putin more time too, and Putin has never been ignorant to the Ukrainian military being dwarfed by the size of the Russian military.

It is already leading to an open war. That is why NATO borders are being reinforced.

Also, there are 4 nuclear plants across Ukraine. All Putin has to do is hit one with a missile and we are all screwed.

>They need Ukraine to fend off Russia

I'm guessing people don't want to admit it, but all of the West and Putin, thought this would be a 2-3 day invasion. That is why they did not have level of military support sent prior.

>....while other countries do their best to weaken and discourage Russia financially and politically.

LMAO. Right and we definitely see how that's stopped him!

Is Putin eating? Is Putin sleeping in a nice fluffy bed? Is Putin still able to buy clothes and use a private bathroom?

If yes, Putin DGAF about the ""consequences"" imposed on his country.

It seems most people don't know how Narcissistic Psychopaths operate.

Gonna see now though.

And the worst thing with those characters, you always think there's no way they would ""go that far"", and them you learn why they are called Psychopaths.

Ukraine has enormous oil reserves that were discovered in 2012. 2 large shale deposits, one in the west near the mountains (also near transnistria) and the other in Donetsk. Funny coincidence about the location of the Russian Separatists ‚Äúpolitical movements‚Äù there.

Additionally a ton of natural gas deposits were discovered in the Black Sea along the southern borders of Ukraine. Russia is a petro state, with its biggest customers being in Western Europe. Ukraine becoming increasingly friendlier with the west was not only a security concern to Russia, but an economic one. So in 2014 after the revolution that overthrew the pro-Russian government based in Kyiv, Russia annexed Crimea. 

A problem with that annexation though, is that Crimea has no real source of fresh water. For a long time they got their water from a canal off of the Dnieper River in Ukraine. Ukraine wasn‚Äôt too keen on letting that water continue to flow to their stolen state, so they closed off the canal.

Crimea doesn‚Äôt have a land connection to Russia. They have a bridge that was recently built across the straight near the Sea of Azov, but all the water consumed by the millions of people on Crimea is trucked and shipped in from Russia. Crimea‚Äôs fresh water reserves are now at 7% capacity.

Now to be clear, I fucking hate Russia.

I would have less issue with sanctions if afterwards, when Putin is gone, there is a full Marshal Plan to compensate those that lost shit (like what US gave to Germany, France, etc post World War 2 to rebuild) and a full shift to democracy , including show trials. The US and Western free world not giving Russia a Marshall Plan post Cold War is why Putin came to power in the first place and did some of the Soviet tactics he did. The 90s was a lawless anarchy in Russia and he brought stability of sorts that the West refused to pay for, like what we did to those who were rules by Nazi Germany.

 >The Five Eyes (FVEY) is an Anglosphere intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries are parties to the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence. The origins of the FVEY can be traced to informal secret meetings during World War II between British and American code-breakers, which started before the U.S. formally entered the war, followed by the Allies' 1941 Atlantic Charter that established their vision of the post-war world.

We have pushed boundaries before when the potential escalation/conflict was of high importance to our strategic interests. Situations like the Cuban Missile Crisis where we escalated with a blockade or more recently with our fleet sailing into the Chinese claimed waters in the South China Sea (risking direct conflict with China if they ever tried to stop us). 

Syria and now Ukraine just aren't that important to the US/NATO in the grand scheme of global interests. They are important enough for NATO/EU to impose sanctions and back Ukraine with military hardware and money but not with actual troops/jets. Russia's interest in Ukraine far outweighs anyone else meaning they are willing to risk way more then we are. NATO/EU being at peace and prosperous far outweighs Ukraine being a western aligned country. 

If Ukraine was of a strategic interest to us, the conflict would have never reached this point. 

>Again, why are they allowed to push every boundary and we are not?    

To answer this more directly. When you push a boundary you have to be willing to accept the consequences. Russia has gotten away with it in recent years because the boundaries they push they care more then we do about it. We simply don't care enough to escalate.  We could totally do what you suggested but it would mean direct conflict with Russia because they aren't going to back down because Ukraine matters a lot more to them then it does to us, they are probably willing to fight a nuclear war over it and we are not. If we escalate we are going to have to back down and look weak eventually to not reach nuclear war.

Same thing with Russia. Most of the pro-Putin people within Russia itself are pro-Communist, and the two breakaway regions that were recognized by Russia within Ukraine are ruled by Communist parties. Putin's main adversary, Navalny, would be considered a right-winger in the US.

What people on the right in America like about Putin really is just that he's a strongman, which is why Trump liked him (and all of his minions basically do whatever Trump says). Politically, he has things that both Republicans and Democrats would both love and hate.

- Russia jets violate it.
- A no fly zone is pointless if we don't enforce it. So we shoot it down. 
- We are now hostile with Russia  
- Russia AA located in Russia or Belarus begin targeting our planes enforcing the No Fly Zone. 
- We can't allow AA to be launching missiles at our jets and blocking our no fly zone. So we need to destroy those installations. 
- Bombers bomb those locations. We have now bombed Russian soil. 
- Russia sends its own bombers/missles to bomb the air strips in NATO territory to stop our bombing and air supremacy. 
- NATO territory being hit means we are in a full shooting war with Russia. 
- Russian military doctrine is the use of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield to show NATO it is serious to get it to back down and to have leverage in negotiating. 
- NATO policy means we would launch our nukes in response and we are all dead. 

This is my hypothetical and could happen a dozen other ways but the end result is the same, we all die. The problem with us escalating is that we don't know exactly how Russia will respond and now things are no longer in our control.

I have a feeling they were figuring the world would have the same reaction to Syria and Aleppo, lots of bluster but little action.

Hundreds of thousands are protesting across most of the world, eventually NATO may be forced to act. We won't know though, not till this gets ugly. Even then it may be 1 or 2 nations that break from NATO and go in it alone. When there's thousands dead, thermobaric bombs wiping out neighborhoods, if it gets that far, how the world reacts...

so check it out, here's some examples  

Litvenenko poisoned 01.11.2006 - 1+1+1+2+6=11
in Russian dates days are first btw  
if you drop the month, and go backwards you get 2.10

 Berezovsky 23.03.2013 - 03, 13, 23, all prime numbers, second, sixth, and ninth, which also add up to 17, another prime number  

23+3+13=39, prime 

23+3+2+13=41, prime



2+0+0+3+2+1+3=11, prime  

07.07.2005 bombings 
7+7+2+5=21, prime - also 7+7+5=19, prime
7, 7, (2+5=7) makes 7,7,7

7, 2, 5, all prime numbers


Add the numbers up one by one and ignore the zeros and it'll almost always be 19, 21, 23, 27, 7, 9, 11. He's got a thing for prime numbers.  

look at the dates of especially the stuff litvenenko & Politskvaya talked about.

Emphasis on ""would"" there.

Yes, there isn't a ""big red button"" the president pushes, but the nuclear football goes with him at all times. In theory the military could disobey an order, but they're not supposed to, and in some ways that idea is also frightening. However if someone disobeyed the commander in chief, they would dismissed until someone did follow the order.

Arms control experts are actually quite concerned by sole launch authority.

That isn't how this works.... 

This isn't high school where confronting a bully and fighting them makes them back off. It is a na√Øve view of geo politics. Hitting Russia directly means we will be at war with them. They aren't going to back down. Few countries in history have ever backed down after being hit by another country (even against overwhelming firepower and the world against them). The calculus is if we do a no fly zone or troops on ground and enter a direct conflict, how will Russia escalate in turn. They aren't going to back down. Direct conflict means we are like 5 steps away from nuclear war and it may go there immediately. Millions more people would die then even the highest estimate possible for Ukraine. The idea that if we don't stop him now we will pay a higher price later is just not true. Diplomacy and cooler rational heads now means a lower price later. This isn't WW2 we have more non war tools we can use that will cripple Russia before they even reach a point where they can invade. We don't need to blindly rush into a direct conflict with them and risk nuclear war. 

You are also making the assumption that Russia/Putin is a rational actor but that went out the window with this invasion. This war is extremely dangerous for Putin and he likely can't lose it to maintain power.

I don't think it would even take 3 days before the biggest weapon they have left is a pocket knife.

>But if NATO acts in a way that helps Putin further consolidate power

What would that look like at this point? You mean countries like China would back him? They already do. Or the African students fleeing Ukraine would then turnaround and insist their governments not support the West with helping defend Ukraine?

Exactly where would this ""power"" that he doesnt have now, suddenly come from? As I understand, most of the world is behind Ukraine save a few. Even China is having to walk the fine line in his support of Putin and he is also sanctioning the U.S. for military movement he doesn't like.


>then he might have a legitimate chance at nuking someone.

This is insanity to believe if Putin needed to use nuclear, he wouldn't. It is a great gift to Putin that the West will let him annex countries as long as he keeps threatening nuclear.

And **nobody** but Putin thinks there would ever be a ""legitimate"" reason to use nuclear. The only person who would be okay with ""illegitimate"" use of nuclear is Putin himself!

Putin knows how much fear can control people and the West has proven to him what it is afraid of. Putin will never take the potential of nukes off the table in getting what he wants.


>I honestly believe that we have to isolate him from those that would act as his hands and feet, so that when he is finally desperate enough

The only thing that would stop Putin is making him starve, live in a bomb shelter and have zero access to any cash. As long as that fool is eating, he will be a threat and won't stop until he gets what he wants. The West was hoping it would only be Ukraine, but his speech made it very clear it is not.

US/NATO disagrees :) 

Also, worth noting from a geo political stand point. We really don't need to directly confront Russia yet even if we wanted to. There is far more value in letting Ukraine embarrass Russia/Putin on the global stage currently. US/NATO is farming that soft power. Those sanctions plus arming Ukraine are doing some heavy lifting on their own without us risking direct conflict. 

Ukraine so far is turning out to be a repeat of the Russo-Japanese War. It has exposed some massive flaws in the Russian military. Before this conflict Russian military was held in pretty high regards, now that mythos has been dispelled and they look incompetent. They can barely fight a war on their border against a weaker foe, they would be crushed by NATO. They are having massive logistical issues, they apparently can't maintain air supremacy, they have terrible mission planning and execution, they have terrible convoy discipline, they would be a walking target dumby for a modern military. Even if they come out of Ukraine winning the worlds view of the threat Russia's military poses has severely been diminished. The Gulf war cemented the USA as a military power able to project power around the world but Ukraine is proving the Russian military is a fragment of what it once was. It is crippling their soft power but on the opposite side these sanctions and backing of Ukraine have increased the US soft power if it works. We are showing the world we don't even need to fight you directly to mess you up. The US managed to unify NATO against Russia and put a stop to the question of NATO unity.
