We fight against it together with the states and people who, remembering the terrible years of that war, do not say ""We can do it again!"" but defend the meaning of the words ""Never again!"" Who did not betray the memory of their heroes and preserve the power of our common values."" 

""We will remember every state that joined us in the struggle for freedom. We will never say that the victory could have happened without any of them. It will be a joint success, called Victory Day of Ukraine. The day when we expel the last occupier from our land. The day when we liberate all our cities and villages. When the soldiers return to their families, the emigrants return to their homes.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 8 May 2023.  


* Russian military recruiters have been targeting central Asian migrant workers in Russia to serve in Ukraine. Recruiters have visited mosques and immigration offices to recruit. At immigration offices, staff who speak Tajik and Uzbek routinely attempt to recruit migrants.  

* Radio Free Europe reported recruiters offering sign-up bonuses of USD $2,390 and salaries of up to USD $4,160 a month. Migrants have also been offered a fast-track Russian citizenship path of six months to one year, instead of the usual five years.  

* The high monthly salary and sign-up bonuses will entice some migrant workers to sign up. These recruits are likely sent to the Ukrainian frontlines where the casualty rate is extremely high.  

* Recruiting migrants is part of the Russian Ministry of Defence’s attempts to fulfil its target of 400,000 volunteers to fight in Ukraine.  

* The authorities are almost certainly seeking to delay any new overt mandatory mobilisation for as long as possible to minimise domestic dissent.

Apparently, the bulk of the photos we’ve seen from Mariupol were taken by this guy, [Andrei Kozhushin](https://www-0629-com-ua.translate.goog/news/3572275/intervu-z-mariupolskim-partizanom-istoria-ludini-aka-rik-prozila-v-okupovanomu-mariupoli-foto?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui&_x_tr_hist=true) who has now left Mariupol and is in Dnipro.

He tells some of the many horrors he witnessed.  Apparently, he comically slept through the invasion, and woke up many hours later to discover his classes were canceled.  

In the first weeks, he changed locations several times, stumbling across bodies everywhere.  Initially moved around so could have electricity.  Walked home to his parents house, in the outskirts of city.  Once there, they didn’t venture out for two months.  When finally did, as returning w food, a sniper shot at him and his dad, blowing out their bike tires, despite obviously being civilians. Andrei decided not to risk his safety to get Russian handouts again.

Next time his father went out solo.  When he returned, the father said a DNR soldier corralled the food line, telling them to be closer together.  Then he stood back, and and shot them. 20-30 died.  Including kids.  After this horrid event, Andriy looked for how he could resist.  He says he bought a Russian phone, started using telegram to contact Mariupol Resistance channel, and they’d ask for photos and equipment movement.  He roamed and took photos.

One day, he was kidnapped by the Russians and detained for two weeks in a town between Mariupol and Russia.  He serendipitously didn’t have his phone on him—he left it home to charge.  He wasn’t beaten, but wasn’t fed much.  It took two weeks for his turn for questioning. They wanted to know if he knew Azov, any military, etc.  He says he would’ve been shot if they’d found his phone.  But to them, he’s just an engineering student no connection to azov. 

He had to walk back, which was 4 days journey, asking strangers for food along the way.  On his walk, he encountered a man wounded in the stomach, so was going to try to help him get home.  As they hobble back, a sniper shot and they both fall, and hit the ground facing one another.  He was uninjured, other man died immediately though.  He says if he stood up, he'd be shot.  So he lay there 6 hours, looking into this dead man’s eyes.  After that long, he heard the sniper climb down off the roof. So he left.  

The Russians installed a Office/post office near his parents house.  He says he hacked their too-easy passwords for their network, downloaded all the documents, and sent them via telegram to the resistance/authorities.  He says that was the easiest task.

Another time, he broke in to his old university, got his old professors and classmates documents, sent them to them.  (The photos of the books on side of road, libraries, bombed out classrooms—he took those.)

He contacted his former professors about his coursework, and they wanted him to send in what he’d done (previously).  In the meantime, in a stunning about face, his parents start suggesting he attend the Russian university to finish his engineering degree.  And they seemed fine with staying.  Contacting his professors, he learned that he could still pay someone to get him to Ukraine-held territory, even in 2023—after all, he was already in the Russian system as having been filtered, so he could get thru ok.  His professors took a collection and someone drove him Mariupol to Rostov; there to Brest, Belarus;  and back to Ukraine.  He didn’t tell his parents he left until he got to Rostov. 

He’s back studying engineering.  Now in Dnipro. 


After he left, he was reported by multiple collaborators as being a Ukrainian spy, and was put on their wanted list.  Thus, can’t return until the Russians leave.",1683525446.0,1683524063.0,t3_13bdatm,t3_13bdatm,,0,241,0,241,0,0,

They absolutely LOVE to throw around [a certain picture](https://history.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/rsz_reichstag.jpg) which they very passionately feel shows the final *Russian* victory over the dark shadow of Nazi fascism in 1945.

A nice story...except for the fact that nobody in the picture is Russian. Hell, the person taking the picture isn't even Russian!

This picture was taken by a Ukrainian man named Yevgeny Khaldei. The man hoisting the flag was a Kazakh-Ukrainian named Alexei Kovalev who settled in Kyiv after the war and went on to become the city's fire chief, a position he served in for his entire professional life. The other two men are Abdulkhakim Ismailov, a Dagestani, and Leonid Gorychev, a native of Minsk, Belarus.

Pretty ironic that the Russians romanticize this image so heavily and use it as a cultural keystone testifying to the ""greatness of Russia"" and there aren't even any Russians in the damn thing! The USSR was a great mash of a wide variety of different people from half of Europe and Asia. VE Day should be a day of remembering that they all came from many tribes and nations under one united flag to stop the fascist menace of their generation, not just the Russians!

Happy VE day!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that this picture isn't even the original flag raising upon the Reichstag!

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-05-08-23/index.html

""A Ukrainian commander in the eastern city of Bakhmut said his unit faces “constant” shelling and they have seen no evidence of the Russian ammunition shortage that Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has claimed.

“The enemy is trying to carry out these attacks 24/7… We have not noticed that they have a shortage of ammunition, as they claim. I think it's the opposite. The intensity of the shelling is only increasing,"" Ihor Shepetin, a battalion commander in the territorial defense brigade, told Ukrainian TV.

Prigozhin, whose Wagner troops have spearheaded the fight to take the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, has repeatedly claimed his fighters lack ammunition. Last week, he said they would withdraw from the area – a threat he has now apparently backtracked from.

Shepetin said Prigozhin’s statements were an effort to ""mislead"" the Ukrainian military in the face of his own “enormous losses”.

“I think that the enemy is already desperate. He is using all means at his disposal to try to drive our defense forces out of Bakhmut. But the enemy is not succeeding and will not succeed,” Shepetin said, adding that the Ukrainians were not in danger of being encircled and – while they had “some logistical problems” – were still able to evacuate the wounded and receive supplies of ammunition.

Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, agreed, saying in a separate TV interview that ""the Russians have no shortage of ammunition. This is absolutely not true."" He added that Ukrainian positions had been shelled more than four hundred times in the past 24 hours and enemy troops were using “more than 25,000 shells per day” on average around the eastern cities of Bakhmut, Lyman and Kupyansk.

“He [Prigozhin] comes up with this nonsense about the shell crisis. However, his main problem is the constant annihilation of personnel by our defense forces. And hence, he is unable to replenish personnel because he cannot recruit people from prisons,” Cherevatyi said.

Cherevatyi claimed that Russia had taken some 20,000 casualties in the Bakhmut area over the past nine months because of Wagner’s “meat grinder” tactic of fighting.""",False,1683584056.0,t3_13bdatm,t3_13bdatm,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

The Muskva is sunk. The Kerch bridge is barley operational. Nordstream is blown up. The Kremlin has been “bombed” in the lamest false flag attack ever.

The Russian economy is in free-fall. Sanctions have crippled every facet of the defence industry.

Finland has joined NATO, and Sweden is soon to come.

CTSO is all but abandoned. Armenia and Kazakhstan are openly hostile to Russia. 

Lavrov is a laughing stock at the UN, even strategic partners like China and India are naming Russia as the aggressor in Ukraine.

So far in 2023, Russia has overall LOST 25 square km in Ukraine. 

Sometime soon, Ukraine will attack with 60,000+ fresh troops armed with the best gear NATO has supplied so far.

I wonder if this is the outcome Putin expected.

The plan to build 1500 tanks per year wasn't that far fetched if you take a look at situation on paper. UVZ is making around 200-250 and is refurbishing another 300 per year. The plan was to increase the speed of refurbishing old tanks and upgrading them to 2022 pattern (or similar) using 5 repair workshops making between 150 and 200 tanks per year. In the meantime they wanted to restore production capability and run 5 factories, so when the old stock would dry up, they would have 5 factories pumping 200-300 tanks each. 

There was one small issue with this. To restore the production capability they would actually have to rebuild those factories, get the equipment from somewhere and people. Skilled people that they sent to the front lines as a meat shield. Even if they would somehow succeeded with rebuilding those plants, they would be empty.

Their lies in the lead up to the invasion were so ridiculous and their justifications for military action such obvious bullshit that Putin couldn't even be honest with the invading force about what their mission was until they were on the way.

The same mentality which says 'we can steal Ukraine's land because we're stronger than them' is the mentality that makes their high command launder state money meant for maintenance and refurbishment of their equipment stocks, and its the same mentality that makes mid level officers put fake soldiers on the books to rort the payroll and ncos to cannibalise their tanks for wiring to sell or just brutalise their soldiers if they don't kick up a percentage.

And in a society built on obvious lies and propaganda, the only people who are available to participate in the special military operation are people as morally bankrupt and prepared to cheat and deceive as the regime itself  or who are just really really dumb- the good people with capacity for independent thought have already gtfo of there.

The result is the high command can't get accurate information because everyone is lying to everyone, and the rank and file are so brutalised and so stupid they can't think for themselves and flounder whenever anything happens that requires initiative or cooperation.

Of course  there have absolutely been corrupt fascist regimes which enjoyed major military success, but I wonder whether the nature of 21st century warfare makes that less likely because it simply isn't enough for a rank and file soldier to be able to dig a foxhole or charge the gap in the barbed wire anymore

Battlefields are becoming more and more dynamic and the ability of rank and file soldiers to do things like gather and disseminate useful intel, react to rapidly changing events without waiting for orders and use or just understand the uses of complicated technology like drones, handheld guided AT and AA missiles is more and more important. So the side with smart, well motivated soldiers has a huge advantage and its far easier to get smart well motivated soldiers to fight for a just cause.

Melitopol would make logistics more complex on the otherside of the Dneiper, south of Kherson and would leave that area far more vulnerable. It would also give better access to Crimea if they wanted to cause problems for military bases or logistical networks.

Truth is none of us really know the details of these regions and what kind of defensive positions are the most vulnerable. None of us knew about Kharkiv and what kind of state it was in before the offensive happened. They did a lot of intelligence gathering to figure that the lines were poorly manned and that they would be faced with lesser resistance past a few critical points.

But Russians are better prepared, but also Ukrainians (I think from what I read) are better prepared. They even use their armor to get close to the trenches, back out, and men on the ground throw grenades to destroy the trench. I have already seen footage of this and it was amazing to see the armor and how it maneuvered in close (probably a infantry style vehicle). Imagine being in a fucking trench and a bmp-3 comes up shooting at you. Fucking scary, to be honest. All you have is a trench. Reminds me how important armor is in a conflict.

Well, Ukraine has a nice amount of armor (better than ever) and I cant wait to see footage of it in action. We will see how they use it and how much they have grown with NATO training and experience (from the other two offensives).",False,1683568726.0,t3_13bdatm,t1_jjcq6b8,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

A sound military tactical and strategic doctrine that's trying to not only make territorial gains but preserve as much of the manpower and equipment as possible, dictates that there be a lot of smaller actions and pinpoint advances.   This will surely put off the people whose sole estimate about how the war's going revolves around where the wiggly line bends on the map.  They are going to be whinging about how it seems it's going nowhere.

Thing is this wouldn't be fully known, and there'd always be wonder ""is it actually capable, or only considered""?

This matters a lot because it's the first weeks. Remember Ukraine, because the US and UK reacted quickly enough that it helped Ukraine hold long enough for the Western world to unite and support Ukraine against NATO. Had the UK or US believed it was a lost cause from the start and not thrown as meant resources Ukraine may not exist as a nation right now. Not to belittle the bravery of Ukrainians, but bravery without resources is just a tragedy, the support gave them a fighting chance.

So now China has its sights on Taiwan. What China wants is to be able to fully overthrow the government and most residence in under a month. But this gets harder of Taiwan gets intentional support, especially in the days/weeks leading to the war. Countries though will do their internal math, of just how much of a chance Taiwan has and take a bet based on that. They don't want to send weapons only to have 80% of it destroyed or worse captured, but if they truly believe Taiwan has a high chance of standing up to China they may be more willing.

So the theory here is that China is you unhappy with Russia and their war, because it's ramping up support for Taiwan, and making the other countries prepare for potential China embargoes.

The story of the DoD overpaying for components due to corruption goes back a long time, and usually begins with the press oversensationalizing a story.

For example, the infamous $900 toilet seats.  When you trace that story back (not to some off the cuff remark by a politician who should know better) you'll see it goes to prototype toilet seats that were engineered to be silent when you closed them for use in submarines.  Submarines where mechanical sounds can be picked up by sonar miles away.  And with a regular toilet seat slamming down generating up to 138 decibels of sound  (and yes, that number is from another oversensationlaized Vice story  https://www.vice.com/en/article/evqagp/deaf-from-a-toilet-seat-physics ) you can understand where the cost may be justified.

I'm not saying that the US government doesn't overspend at times, I'm saying its usually due to incompetence and confusion rather than corruption.  Other governments may vary.

As part of their surprise attack on Russian military bases in Crimea, the Ukrainian military also carried out a daring night beach landing assault. Ukrainian special forces, supported by naval vessels and aircraft, landed on the Crimean coast under the cover of darkness.

The landing force quickly established a beachhead, securing the area and neutralizing any opposition. Using advanced night vision equipment, the Ukrainian special forces were able to navigate through the dark and take the Russian defenders by surprise.

The Ukrainian military's use of amphibious assault vehicles and landing craft enabled them to quickly transport troops and equipment from naval vessels to the shore. Ukrainian attack helicopters and UAVs provided air support, destroying Russian defenses and providing cover for the landing force.

The night beach landing attack proved to be a decisive turning point in the conflict. It allowed the Ukrainian military to establish a foothold in Crimea, disrupting the Russian occupation and setting the stage for the subsequent military operations.

The success of the night beach landing attack was due to the Ukrainian military's meticulous planning, advanced technology, and well-trained troops. The use of night vision equipment and amphibious assault vehicles enabled the Ukrainian special forces to execute the assault under cover of darkness and overcome the Russian defenses.

Overall, the Ukrainian military's success in liberating Crimea was the result of a combination of tactics and technologies, including night beach landing attacks, cyberattacks, precision-guided munitions, and intelligence-gathering capabilities.

No matter how good you are at predicting, it's nothing but an educated guess.

Real test matters.

But you're missing the point I was making. It doesn't matter what is the true or false scenario here, what matters is *perception* by other countries. It doesn't matter if China has a missile system that will make patriot counter missiles switch sides. The truth is that the Patriot has proven itself in real combat against real last-generation hyper-sonic missiles. It may be that Russia lied and exaggerated 100x while China actually under-promised (on purpose) and actually does 500x better than Russia, and the Patriot system can't handle it.

But none of that matters. Because if the rest of the world doesn't *believe* that, and they truly believe that Taiwan has a solid fighting chance, they will support and help it, and they will give Taiwan a lot of support. Which means that China's war, even if it happened to be an inevitable victory, would take years rather than months, years that include heavy embargoes and a tough fight to takeover ""the land that was always theirs"".

Russia's escalation and actions in Ukraine, and the fact that they are throwing everything so badly against Ukraine is terrible for China. Before, the question of how effectively could China use missiles and artillery to sufficiently harm Taiwan was a matter of what the US said vs what China said, and really no one could be sure what would come out of it. But now it's China's word against the Ukraine's victories against Russia. It doesn't matter if Russia is blundering and screwing up right now, and I wouldn't be surprised that in Xi Ping's view, the only reason Russia hasn't won is because of Putin's ineptitude, not because wars of conquest are not viable in this day and age. In his view Putin is helping NATO and the west more confident supporting Taiwan, and making it that much more expensive and complicated to win. And Xi Ping here is in a pickle, see he doesn't care about a united China, Hong Kong was already slowly merging and it was inevitable that it was going to happen at the end of the 50 year contract, Taiwan could be easily folded in, but the process would take decades, slowly changing cultural mindset and helping both nations share a stronger unity even with their tensions, and it was clear that Taiwan wasn't going to become an independent state anytime soon either way. But what Xi Ping cares about is being China's uniter, and he doesn't have time, nations do well over centuries, but Xi Ping will only live a few more decades at most, which is why it's so absurd to compare him with someone immortal like Winnie the Pooh. So he has to rush this, and anything that tells him that it simply won't happen, well it must be false.",False,1683607380.0,t3_13bdatm,t1_jjf3m7c,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

It's the opposite. We know how armor without air support handles Russian defenses because it did not fare very well against a properly constructed Russian defense in the fall. Ukraine did not successfully penetrate the Russian defenses at Kherson despite 3 months of intense attacks with large armored formations. Russia withdrew from Kherson not because they were folding to Ukrainian attacks but because they could not supply enough ammunition over the two bridges across the river.

I'm not saying the counteroffensive will be a repeat of Kherson, but it's wrong to claim we don't have evidence of how these doctrines clash. Russia's defenses have been tested, and we know now that Russia is actually good at defending.

NATO training and vehicles will help, but none of these things allow them to breeze through minefields or survive artillery bombardment. NATO tanks die to artillery just like Soviet tanks.

The key to Ukraine's success will be their own artillery -- how much they have stored up, and how much of it is mobile and able to keep up with their advance.
