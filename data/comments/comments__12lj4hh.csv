>Now, large industrial regions in the Urals report most of the Russian losses. There, thousands of people were mobilised and sent to battle after very little training. We confirmed the deaths of 1,900 Russian mobilised soldiers. Some say their comrades were killed because of poor leadership

We're getting more details this afternoon about the 15 Russian diplomats who have been expelled by Norway this week.

Yesterday we reported that the diplomats were removed over accusations they were carrying out intelligence work from the embassy in Oslo.

New details from the Norwegian police security service (PST) reveal the diplomats had sought to recruit sources, intercept communications and buy advanced technology.

Their real employers were the Russian GRU, FSB and SVR intelligence services, PST counterintelligence chief Inger Haugland told a news conference today.

""This [expulsion] lowers the threat from Russian intelligence in Norway by permanently reducing the number of intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover,"" he said.

The 15 men account for more than a third of the 40 accredited Russian diplomats in Norway, the country's foreign ministry said.

It marks the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats by Oslo.

Moscow would respond to the expulsions, the Russian state-owned news agency TASS said, without giving any further details.

I guess this crazy behaviour started for two reasons:

\- Putin is forcing him to look unhinged in order to look less aggressive in comparison.

\- Medvedev is trying to convince russian people that if Putin will lose his power, Russia will still have a strong leader able to fight US and NATO.

If it's about the first option I can see him being forced to act like a fool with little options to look for, but if it's part of his own agenda, he better know that after all the nonsense, aggressive threats against pretty much anyone, he's has no future as a leader of Russia.

GGG: My name is Gorelov Pavel Nikolaevich, serving in recon company of the 99th regiment. Today we had a bit of a misunderstanding, and as a result we were placed in a hole. This happened in the 99th regiment, and the commander was perfectly OK with it. We will be here for the next three days. What really happened was that the guys I serve with decided to have some beers. They were ratted out to our MP, who put us in a hole. Here it is(pans around). We are in mud, under rain, all wet. All guys have their faces smashed. Grandpa, show us your jaw. I want this made public, so everyone can see what our own people did to us...

Grandpa: I'm afraid to move it. I ain't got a jaw, I can't move my jaw...

GGG: Look at this mud. I can't even think about sitting down, forget laying down. F\*cking impossible. They are holding us in a hole. A deep one. Barred on top. Locked. No water. Gotta piss into those plastic bottles. The next three days will be with neither food nor water. That's what happens in the 99th regiment. I'm asking for help, I'm asking the Military Prosecutor's office to bring the regiment's commander to justice. I tried to defend one of the guys, and got grabbed too. They didn't touch me though, because I was sober. The guys are sober now too, all the drunkenness has been beaten out of them. Grandpa got his jaw broken, it's all sideways and swollen. All this was done by the MP. And the commanding officer allowed this to happen to his own! We work recon at the very front, always under shelling, all the time. And they do this to us?! We don't give up, don't refuse to serve. But this f\*ckery has to stop!

Optronics and vetronics of the new tank have been significantly modernized, for example, by merging the video and infrared channels available to the entire crew, allowing them  have a significantly better perception of the environment in which they live.  In addition, an auxiliary unit with a capacity of 20 Kwh was installed, which allows the operation of all systems of the armored vehicle even when the engine is switched off.

On the other hand, the armament of the tank did not seem to have evolved in this version, the main gun remained the Rheinmetall 120 mm/L55A1, while no system for dropping drones or anti-tank missiles or anti-aircraft defenses had been installed.  Even more surprising was the lack of an autonomous small-caliber turret mounted on the tank to provide close protection.

But it's likely that those things will come later.  In fact, according to [esut.de](https://esut.de/2023/04/fachbeitraege/41311/neue-kampfpanzer-bundeswehr-soll-leopard-2-a8-erhalten/), the Leopard 2A8 would only be a step in the development of the Leopard 2AX, which should be available in two to three years.

Also Interesting: According to the article, the Bundeswehr wants to conclude a framework agreement with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), under which the 18 brand-new battle tanks will initially be purchased, but which will include options for the delivery of a mid-three-digit number of battle tanks of the same type.",1681488816.0,1681488628.0,t3_12lj4hh,t3_12lj4hh,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

Do you recall the news about that girl who drew that picture being taken from her dad and him being arrested?  

Here's a quote from an article in the Guardian dated Wednesday 1st March 2023 and titled [Russian man detained over daughter’s pro-Ukraine drawings](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/01/russian-detained-over-anti-war-statements-and-daughter-taken-into-care):  
>“It’s important to understand that the Moskalyov case is a part of a larger horrifying trend – as a part of a wider wartime crackdown the regime is routinely persecuting anti-war minors and their families, while squeezing the Russian youth into a heavily militarised culture,” Kuznetsova said.  

>“According to our data, at least 544 minors were detained in anti-war protests in the past year, and seven minors are currently criminally prosecuted for their anti-war positions. At least 19 anti-war teachers were fired … In particular, minors are targeted for sharing posts or comments about anti-war rallies, leaflets against mobilisation, holding solo demonstrations, expressing anti-war views during school events, demonstrating anti-war clothing, making anti-war inscriptions.”  

So back very early March when the article was written, and I quote, ""at least 544 minors were detained in anti-war protests in the past year, and seven minors are currently criminally prosecuted for their anti-war positions.""  

That's right, Russia is purposefully going after children, their parents and school teachers. Basically anyone who dares to think or express any thought which the Kremlin forbids. They are using the threat of taking children away from parents to keep people in line. We know they'll do it too as they already have.  

Regarding access to information, the older demographic tend to get their news from the Kremlin controlled TV. They tend to believe what they are told and tend to support Putin. The younger demographic tend to get their news online and tend to be more anti-Putin.  

Support for Putin also varies by location. The biggest cities tend towards disliking Putin compared to the very rural areas who tend to be more pro-Putin.  

That's a *very* basic generalisation.  

This is why back when the war first started and people wanted Russia to be cut off from the global internet there were experts on information and Russia who said that such a plan would actually cause far more harm to those who are anti-Putin than those who are pro-Putin.  

Besides, all the really anti-Putin people who were still in Russia when war broke out and who could flee Russia have already done so. They realised that their very lives would be in danger if they remained in Russia.  

Even years before the war there were Russian exiles, such as Garry Kasparov, who knew their lives would be in danger if they remained in Russia.  

If you live in Russia and oppose Putin you are either murdered, arrested by the violently brutal police and then the ""justice"" system will financially cripple you for life, or you end up in prison and may have an ""accident"".  

If you haven't already seen them, you might find Garry Kasparov's various interviews regarding Russia, Putin and this war very interesting.

In one of them two companies were garrisoned. It wasn't a free win though. The recon group was caught by a RU drone and they tried to hide in one of the buildings. Russians made a full artillery barrage against that building. For 6 people. Unfortunately I don't know if they survived. 

What's currently going on in Bakhmut will be studied for urban warfare for years to come. Russian pilots are learning how to use guided munitions (believe or not - that's not what they train for normally) using Bakhmut buildings as a target practice. Then artillery finishes the building. That's how they are progressing. 

Wagner is down to 20% of personnel. They got some fresh mobiks from switcheroo after they made peace with Russian MoD. So MoD sends a letter to a person, person comes to the draft point, where it's sold (sometimes literally) to Wagner. When the news spread out, even MoD has problems with recruitments. In one region from 8000 letters only less than 200 showed up (oh BTW - mobilization never stopped, it just went quiet).

Yesterday Russians were supposed to storm Ivanivske to cut out the defenders from supplies, I saw Ukrainian 3rd brigade elements trying to flank them. We'll see how it went.


One more thing. Prigozhin is saying Wagner is killing 10k Ukrainians per week in Bakhmut. Two weeks ago he said Ukrainian loses are around 35k there in total. Maybe he should stick to one number?


Edit: just got an update - the RU attack on Ivanivske and Khromove failed. Units used for this attack were taken from the assault on the train station.

When it comes to tanks they're hurting. Confirmation for that is a snails pace at upgrading existing tanks (T72B to a T72B3 for example or T80B to T80BVM) and being forced to pull out obsolete tanks for their army (T55, T54 and T62).

When it comes to vehicles like BMP, BMD, BTR etc I don't have a clue what's still left, I know that they keep blowing them up on an almost daily basis.

Where ru unfortunately isn't hurting is the artillery department and long range department. They have plenty of akatsiya, tyulpan, gvozdika, grad etc. Ukraine does have a focus on these but in Oryx's list there's a huge gap in losses for those versus most other categories that have offensive capabilities.

Aviation is kinda in a grey zone. Ru can't afford any losses, because they would have to replace them with new models and they don't have the time to keep pumping these, but at the same time they don't lose planes or helicopters on a daily basis.

Navy is like the least hurt of all (though seeing the moskva go blublub last year was funny).

The question becomes how much is Ukraine willing to sacrifice to make gains against Russia's fortifications, and how much is the average Russia solider willing to stand and fight for the territory Russia has gained over fleeing and saving their own lives?

The weather has been really shitty this year as well (compared to last Spring) so most military analysts are assuming that if Ukraine does attempt a massive counteroffensive, it will most likely be well into Summer.

More and more troops are being trained by Western allies for Ukraine, and many of the tanks and newer artillery pieces and APC's that Ukraine are getting are new to the soldiers, so they also want to be careful that the equipment they're getting from the West isn't wasted by a failed attempt at a blitzkrieg, and they also want to make sure that the people operating them are as prepared as a Western soldier would be entering battle.

Long story short: we don't really know right now, but all signs point to Ukraine attempting to probe and find the biggest weakness along the Russian lines and to try and will attempt a breakthrough around late June or early July.

People by and large don't seem to know that Spetsnaz is a generalized term in the Russian army that encompasses many different types of units with many different types of focus.

From what I've been able to gather, the combat special forces versions of Spetsnaz units did very poorly at the beginning of the war during the failed blitz, but have significantly over-performed in the most recent phases of the war (specifically around Bakhmut) when compared to other units of the RA and Wagner.

There is no doubt that many Spetsnaz units have taken a pounding though, and a lot of Spetsnaz troops that used to belong to a whole unit (that now only exists on paper) are fed into other understaffed units to reconstitute Russia's fledgling BTG's.

If there will be major protests or regime change, it was never going to come this soon. Something must  break the propaganda first, but even then a civilian overthrow of Putin may be impossible.

Everything from Crimea needs to pass through Armyansk or Henichesk. It's going to be incredibly difficult for UA to ford on the way to Crimea, and we'll likely see a blockade of it rather than an incursion. But equally difficult for Russia to run supplies through there if Ukraine get meaningful fire control over those two supply hubs.

Ukraine still holds Vuhledar which means that they are very close to the H-20 highway connecting the Eastern and Southern fronts. Taking control of it would choke the movement of units and supplies before Ukraine even takes back any meaningful territory.

Broadly speaking, Russia doesn't have very robust supply routes to the Southern front.

They've been extremely effective on Reddit, I'm afraid. People, don't get me wrong. I'm a liberal, I think Donald Trump is a demonic piece of shit. Putin should fucking die. But, my god. The leftist talk on Reddit has become increasingly unhinged, in my opinion. Many have taken all the red meat bait given to them. They saw what the right was doing and (I believe in the hubris of many) thought it could never happen to them. Like there was some moral superiority of their cause that would be a psychological shield... but no, they are human and subject to the same weaknesses and impulses as everyone else. And now I see many merrily walking down the same path.

But I feel uncomfortable even bringing this up. There is no room for nuance, self-reflection, or self-criticism among these types.

The contribution of other allied powers in the pacific war did not materially affect the outcome of the conflict.

Let's look at it the largest contribution of other allied powers:

* China - already invaded by Japan and were unable to to do much more than distract the Imperial Japanese Army.

* Soviet Union - Invaded Japanese holdings in Asia in the last week of the war. I seriously doubt anyone who can claim that the Soviet Union helped the Pacific theater of the war.

* Great Britain - Dispatched a handful of naval squadrons (some of which suffered heavy losses early in the war), but played [second fiddle to the US in the theater](http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/event/forum/pdf/2011/14.pdf) by design.

* India (part of the British Empire) - Fought Japan in a largely defensive war to prevent India from falling to Japan. Fought as part of the BE to reconquer Burma, but by the time this happened it was a secondary theater of the war during it's final year.

* France - Was too busy being conquered by Germany to prevent the Japanese occupation of their colony of French Indochina.

* Australia (part of the British Empire) - Fought a nasty jungle war in New Guinea and defended Australia, but this was a secondary theater after 1942. Largest material contribution to the outcome of the war was the presence of several Australian naval ships among US naval squadrons.

In summation, while the non-US allies helped in secondary parts of the Pacific War, their contributions were relatively minor and mostly resulted in Japanese Army forces being tied down in a war over various European colonial possessions. The IJA itself was a minor player in a war that was dominated by naval and aerial combat.

The war was won and lost at sea, and not in the jungles of New Guinea and Burma.

Meanwhile the United States:

* Directly responsible for the sinking of the majority of Japan's Navy, including all of their aircraft carriers and battleships lost in the war.
* Directly responsible for conducting a submarine blockade of the Japanese home islands
* Directly responsible for all of the offensive operations in the Central Pacific, which established bases that threatened the Japanese home islands with invasion.
* Supplied all of the other allies with weapons, ships, planes, tanks, and supplies

You could drop the contributions made by any and all of the non-US allies in the Pacific War and the trajectory of the war would remain largely unchanged.

Why?

Because this was a naval war. The USN was in the midst of a massive shipbuilding program that swamped the IJN. This program was so large that the USN had more commissioned ships afloat than the *rest of the world combined.* The largest British contribution in the naval war was the [British Pacific Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Pacific_Fleet) which consisted of six aircraft carriers and 15 smaller carriers.

The USN's size in fleet carriers alone during that time dwarfed the RN.",1681471785.0,1681471588.0,t3_12lj4hh,t1_jg7n6lg,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

There is no trying to understand Russia's position when, in their eyes, wiping away your history and culture is priority 1. To do otherwise is to disaster, from any and all. I do understand the fear of escalation. We don't want or need nuclear war. Yet in the eyes of Russia, or any one in such a position, that just emboldens them. It is the equivalent of nuclear extortion, and we may as well just wave the white flag now to Russia and any government/autocracy that believes similarly while in possession of nuclear weaponry. 

At some point a stand must be made. This *is* a conflict bigger than Ukraine. It *is* a battle of political systems - autocracy v. democracy/republic. Free elections and decisions on sovereignty v. pre-determined elections by ""the party"" and imperialistic tendencies. There's a reason China, Iran and North Korea seem to align so well with Russia on this, and it ain't from a common cultural background. This is a battle of political systems. China has already broken Hong Kong, in record time against the treaties it sign. They 100% find the threat of a democratic 'China' in Taiwan an existential threat to their country's government and the CCP as **the** party in China. 

Russia seeing a country so similar to theirs, in their mind, going toward actual democracy and open elections *AND* to the West looks terrible upon Russia as a country and the government. All those decades and lies and false promises again and again and again to their people under different regimes that were all autocratic or one-party controlled being shined upon by Ukraine's drastic transformation before Crimea was even taken by Russia became existential to the Kremlin. After over a decade and a half of pretty iron-fisted rule by Putin and his party, the idea that Ukraine would be able to sccussefuly overthrow a puppet to take control of their country and elections was a shot across the bow for the Russian government, who has had to deal with more unrest in recent years, especially when Clinton was Sec of State, and whom was blamed by Putin for aggravating the internal politics of Russia (never can take credit for his own misdeeds, only successes). 

They must not let their people know there is another path to success, prosperity, peace and freedom, for what would that mean for the Russian government as it is today and in 2014? It *is* existential for them. China, Iran, North Korea all see bedfellows in each other, and this conflict ups the stakes for them, as they see how Russia is faring, as well as how welcomed Ukraine has become within a decade into the West's arms. It's a shining example for people within their countries who want change. They must, therefore, use every tool at their disposal to assist Russia. Because if Russia can be going through this, what does that mean for them? What does that mean if time came that they, these other countries, were involved in such a conflict? Who would comr to aid them?

So, in conclusion, the existential nature of it from one side does not render the whole question moot. If they see and are treating it as such, by damned must we, as they will not suddenly stop and reflect. It will take more and more and more casualties for the populace to turn on Putin. That has been Russia's MO in every conflict I can think of going back to the early 1800s. Mass bodies to buy time for either their winter or resupplies or exhausting the enemy through attrition. As long as Russia has a supply train to support the buying of time, they feel confident. We'll have to see how well that confidence is borne out on their end, but for the side of Ukraine and democracy, we need to actually show all autocracies globally that the arsenal of democracy is real and operational.

I'm personally of the opinion that the Soviet invasion of Manchuria was less of a factor because the reports that the Japanese would have gotten at the early stages of the invasion were confused. The Japanese Army believed it could halt the Soviet advance.

Think about this: 

*Your cities have been bombed and destroyed. Your people are starving. You're preparing your southern coastline for the expected invasion. The enemy has the mastery of the skies with their high-flying bombers- they can fly anywhere and hit any target they want whenever they want.*

*Then a city is destroyed by a single bomb. ""Not possible!"" you say in denial. But after a second city is destroyed in the same way, you start to realize that you're on the verge of being destroyed until nothing remains. You try to find a way out that lets your country keep as much of their territory, military, and leadership as possible and avoid the unconditional surrender terms your enemies demand.*

*Then, in the middle of your meeting, a bomber flies overhead and drops leaflets reiterating the enemy's surrender demands.*

1. And how far is it from Berdyansk to the bridge? Indeed.

2. Hahaha, air defense against a few of the named options is just not viable.

3. Neptune has 280km range, try again.

4. I am talking about TRLG you idiot.

Everything you're saying is bullshit, by virtue of the original question being about range. Then after that, you often are even factually wrong about the very weapon systems proposed or about the range it is towards the bridge.

This has nothing to do about being pro-Ukraine or not. Stop strawmanning.",1681494484.0,1681494251.0,t3_12lj4hh,t1_jg96s9m,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The only one here who was trying to troll is you, you at multiple times came out swinging with factually incorrect information regarding both the distance to the bridge and the range of various systems. And still refuse to accept you're moving goalposts by increasing the argument to a certain amount of warhead size required to take it out of commission completely. Only to not accept you were wrong.

Secondly, the Kerch straight isn’t “straight.” The way it’s positioned has outcroppings of land that would foil the Neptune’s ballistic path anyway.

All of this of course still doesn’t matter because they don’t carry an adequate payload for the hundredth time, and Ukraine doesn’t hold any of that territory.",False,1681503201.0,t3_12lj4hh,t1_jg9gqx9,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Both Neptune and Harpoon can maneuvre in flight along a flight path, so try again. Also, very funny that you say ballistic flight path for a cruise missile. Not to mention not realizing that if it were a ballistic missile, it wouldn't care about any terrain. Talk about not knowing what you talk about, haha.

For the hundredth time, it's not needed to carry a payload to destroy the bridge entire. Making it difficult if not impossible to have the same logistics over the bridge is what is important, like Antonivsky bridge which you keep ignoring.
