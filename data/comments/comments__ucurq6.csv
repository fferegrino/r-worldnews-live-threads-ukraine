Myhailo Podolyak said that ""the Belgorod, Voronezh, and Kursk regions are now also beginning to actively study such a concept as 'demilitarization.'"" 

In these Russian regions, large fuel depots that provide fuel for the Russian army's armored vehicles periodically burn and ammunition depots explode. For various reasons.""

It comes after blasts were heard early Wednesday in three Russian regions bordering Ukraine, local authorities and Russian state media reported.

A blast in Belgorod was followed by a fire at the ammunition depot in the village of Staraya Nelidovka, about 10 miles north of the Ukrainian border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram on Wednesday.

In the region of Kursk, residents “heard explosions” around 2:45 a.m. local time. The governor, Roman Starovoyt, said the details surrounding the explosions are still ""being clarified,"" but that there were no casualties or destruction.

Two loud bangs were heard by residents in the Shilovo neighborhood of the Russian city Voronezh at 4:40 a.m., according to Russian state media TASS, citing authorities. 

Podolyak added: ""How can this be explained? Very simply. If you (the Russians) decide to attack another country en masse, kill everyone there en masse, crush peaceful people en masse with tanks, and use warehouses in your regions to provide the killings, then sooner or later the debts will have to be paid back.

Japan will provide food and medicine to war-torn Ukraine as additional relief supplies, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday after speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone.  
  
Kishida told reporters after their roughly 40-minute conversation that Japan will step up diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine in cooperation with the Group of Seven nations, which are leading efforts to punish Russia for its invasion.  
  
Japan has strongly condemned Russia's onslaught against Ukraine as shaking the foundation of the international order to its core, imposing a raft of sanctions against Moscow at the expense of bilateral ties amid a long-unresolved territorial dispute.  
  
According to the Foreign Ministry, Kishida told Zelenskyy that Japan will deliver requested items, including food and medicine, as soon as possible.  
  
Within the bounds of the pacifist Constitution, Japan has so far sent or decided to provide bulletproof vests, helmets, protective masks and commercial drones since Russia's attack against its neighbor began in late February.  
  
""President Zelenskyy explained his views on future assistance and sanctions,"" Kishida told reporters.  
  
Kishida and Zelenskyy previously spoke by phone in early March.  
  
Kishida has repeatedly said any unilateral use of force to change the status quo should never be tolerated.

But in a new study released Wednesday by Microsoft, it is now clear that Russia used its A-team of hackers to conduct hundreds of far more subtle attacks, many timed to coincide with incoming missile or ground attacks. And it turned out that, just as in the ground war, the Russians were less skillful, and the Ukrainians were better defenders, than most experts expected.

Nato's assertion of escalation dominance by stealth has helped the Ukrainians check the Russians and to contain the war, argues Hew Strachan.

Since the initial shock of 24 February, the war in Ukraine has acquired a deceptive stability for those lucky enough to be viewing it from a distance. The situation maps published in the papers look much the same from day to day, with the Russians occupying territory in the east and to the south. In reality, buildings and ground change hands multiple times in fierce tactical actions. Generals talk about the “big-hand, small map” problem, in which scales simplify major problems, foreshorten distances and reduce the obstacles to a two-dimensional plane.  

The opportunity for strategic surprise seems to have passed. Satellite and signal intelligence, much of it in the public domain, gives ample warning of unfolding operations. Russia’s immediate intentions are clear to the world, not just to the Ukrainians. But one big strategic shift has occurred. Almost imperceptibly, the Russians have conceded escalation dominance to Nato. ",False,1651062792.0,t3_ucurq6,t3_ucurq6,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

*summary*

(CNN) Two months into Moscow's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the United States continues to roll out unprecedented sanctions against a rogues' gallery of Russian oligarchs, including many of the country's most affluent and influential men.

Washington's latest round of sanctions came just last week, targeting Russia's virtual currency mining industry and slapping new sanctions on a raft of Russian institutions and individuals, including Konstantin Malofeyev - an oligarch accused by US authorities of providing financial backing for Moscow's separatist designs on Crimea and who has links to the American far-right.

There has been an unprecedented level of sanctions placed against Russian oligarchs since the February 24 invasion: Oligarchs have been divested of their American mansions and dispossessed of yachts that resemble floating fortresses.

There are still a number of major oligarchs who have yet to be specifically sanctioned, among them notorious figures like Roman Abramovich, who is notable for previously owning the Chelsea football club.The reason oligarchs are able to continue acquiring, spending and enriching themselves can be summed up in one word: anonymity.

For years, a number of American industries have provided oligarchs access to anonymous financial flows needed to hide their wealth, preventing investigators and journalists from tracking their investments.While wealthy Westerners initially took advantage of these anonymous shells to hide their own wealth via offshoring networks, it was the oligarchs who have rushed to use them in recent years, stashing their money across the US. 

In a momentous move last year, Congress finally passed legislation that will effectively ban anonymous shell company formation - but those restrictions haven't yet been implemented, and we're still waiting for the final language in the new regulations.

These kinds of anonymous financial vehicles and under-the-table investments have allowed oligarchs to plow vast amounts of wealth into the US - and not only keep that wealth hidden from anyone searching it out but further use it to upend American policy and threaten American national security in the process.

Commercial real estate buildings, steel factories, manufacturing plants - all of them have already been connected to assorted oligarchs.

For now, oligarchs from Russia - and equally wealthy and notorious figures from other countries - will continue to use all tools of financial secrecy in the United States to bankroll dictators threatening American national security and global stability.",False,1651041319.0,t3_ucurq6,t3_ucurq6,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

""EUROPEAN TRUTH"" - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 2022, 10:12

Some politicians from the CDU, the Greens and the Free Democrats have spoken out against former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a SPD member, for failing to change his position on Russia and continuing to work with its energy companies.

According to European Truth , Tagesspiegel reports .

Moritz Körner, a member of the FDP's presidium, said the ex-chancellor already deserved a place on Vladimir Putin's list of close associates and was ""not a representative of the top German domestic politicians, but of the Kremlin."" 

A similar view was expressed by CDU member Roderich Kiesewetter. ""The fact that Schroeder has not yet distanced himself from Putin and Russia only proves how"" strong ""he is in their service… So we should talk about sanctions against the entire Putin entourage. And including Schroeder,"" he said. 
Green MP Reinhard Boutikofer also called for sanctions against Schroeder and other former European officials who later ""sold out to Putin."" In his opinion, Schroeder should be deprived of official attributes related to the chancellery and excluded from the ranks of the SPD.


SPD member Michael Roth did not rule out European sanctions against the ex-chancellor. He expressed regret that Germany had to seriously discuss possible sanctions against the former leader, who became a Russian lobbyist. ""The EU must check who is responsible for this war in one way or another, who justifies and defends it, or belittles it. So the EU will have to decide something about this,"" he said. 

It will be recalled that SPD co-leader Saskia Esken recently said that Schroeder should leave the party he has been a member of for almost 60 years. The SPD's leadership has long distanced itself from the Chancellor. Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbayl approached him in late February, urging him to resign from Russian companies. There was no response to this letter. 

In a recent major interview with the New York Times, Schroeder  defended the need to support cooperation with Russia despite the war in Ukraine. He also said he did not believe in Putin's personal involvement in the Bucha war crimes, and said that ""Putin himself is interested in ending the war as soon as possible, but it is not easy.""""

From CNN's Anna Chernova

Igor Volobuev, vice president of Gazprombank, one of Russia’s largest private banks and part of the Gazprom holding, quit his post and left Russia in dissent over the war in Ukraine and is planning to join the Kyiv territorial defense, he told in an interview with an independent Russian online publication ""The Insider."" 

“I could no longer be in Russia. I am Ukrainian by nationality, I was born in Akhtyrka, I could no longer observe from the outside what Russia is doing to my homeland,” Volobuev said in a video posted by ""The Insider"" on YouTube.

In the video, Volobuev claimed he managed to get to Kyiv despite holding a Russian passport and said he wants “to stay in Ukraine until the victory.”

Explaining his departure, Volobuev said, “My homeland is in danger now, and I cannot live a well-fed, contented life while my father, who lives in Akhtyrka, is being killed, when my relatives, acquaintances, friends are being killed.” Volobuev’s father spent a month in a cold basement but is now safe, he added.

Volobuev added that he has been thinking about fighting for Ukraine and joining Ukrainian territorial defense since the start of the war on Feb. 24.

“This is a crime on the part of Putin, the Russian authorities, and, in fact, the Russian people,” Volobuev said referring to the atrocities and war crimes committed in Ukraine.

According to Volobuev, he had been working at Gazprombank for the last 6 years and previously at Gazprom for over 16 years.

From Svitlana Budzhak-Jones and Hannah Ritchie

Blasts were heard early Wednesday in three Russian regions bordering Ukraine, local authorities and Russian state media reported.

The depot fire in Belgorod: The blast was followed by a fire at the ammunition depot in the village of Staraya Nelidovka, about 10 miles north of the Ukrainian border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on his Telegram on Wednesday. He added that there were “no casualties among civilians.”

Explosions in Kursk: In the region of Kursk, residents “heard explosions” around 2:45 a.m. local time. The governor, Roman Starovoyt, said the details surrounding the explosions are still ""being clarified,"" but that there were no casualties or destruction.

The Kursk explosions come just two days after two Ukrainian drones were shot down by Russian air defense crews in the region's village of Borovskoye, according to Starovoyt. 

Bangs heard at dawn in Voronezh: Two loud bangs were heard by residents in the Shilovo neighborhood of the Russian city Voronezh at 4:40 a.m., according to Russian state media TASS, citing authorities. 

""A civil defense and emergency response team and a team of the Russian Emergencies Ministry are currently at the site of the incident. An Investigative Committee official is about to arrive,"" a district civil defense and emergency official reportedly told TASS.

Voronezh is located roughly 200 miles from the Ukrainian border and is a major military and transport hub. 

Russian officials have repeatedly accused Ukraine of mounting cross-border attacks on fuel depots and military installations, claims which Ukrainian government agencies say are intended to stoke ""anti-Ukrainian sentiment.""

1) We will not do any hostile moves towards them, we live in peace for 30 years and it's an okayish relation.

2) Transnistria is not all-out controlled by russians, they have somewhat of a democracy, the territory is ruled by Sheriff clan, they have a lot of business with Moldova, Ukraine and EU. They don't want any war, not even with Ukraine. They're in a situation like Belarus, but less ""shithead ass kissing dictator"". Their ""leader"" tries to keep good relations with Moldova, we keep constant dialog.

3) All these things that are happening are a combo of russian false-flags to invade from Transnistria, perhaps even trying to use their troops as well. But also possibly some Ukrainian spec-ops (at least the radio towers)

4) Most if not all Transnistria people have Moldovan, some even have Romanian citizenship, lots of them work in Chisinau (Moldova capital) - as I'm saying, there is literally NO HATE from any side towards another. If the situation will get worse it will only be a result of Russian propaganda, which is currently passive on the topic. They say that Ukraine is attacking Transnistria.

All of this hints at a kinda low risk for Moldova, but this will change for sure if Russia is able to connect with Transnistria through Odessa region",False,1651050673.0,t3_ucurq6,t3_ucurq6,,0,131,0,131,0,0,

The Transnistrian military itself is around 4,500 to 7,500 soldiers. Say they even launch a offensive from there, how long can they even supply it? Transnistria is a pretty narrow and isolated strip of land. I can't imagine they have large fuel and ammunition storage to sustain a large offensive. Resupply would have to happen through the air (cause Moldova aint letting that shit in) which, assuming the most ideal conditions for Russia, is currently contested by Ukraine but more likely is dominated by Ukraine. Ukrainian Air superiority in the area is another thing which makes it silly. 

The Troops there are of questionable quality to through up against what is increasingly well armed and experienced military. Transnistria has 18 T-64 tanks and a mess of old Soviet equipment. The Russian forces there are also lightly armed. They weren't put there to launch a offensive.   

If all this noise is a ploy to pull troops away from Odessa for a amphibious invasion (there's at least one tank regiment (division?) protecting Odessa, that might not work because there are probably sufficient forces to repel an offensive without pulling too much of it force away from Odessa. Additionally, there are significant coastal defenses through the SE Coast (as shown by the sinking of the Moskva) so the situation there doesn't change too much. Those ships make like they're going to actually launch a amphibious assault, they're probably going to join the flagship as a Ukrainian cultural dive site.  

An invasion of SW Ukraine doesn't make sense either. First Russian/Transnistrian forces would have to invade through Moldova which drags it into the war. A Russian amphibious assault of of deep SW Ukraine doesn't make sense. First, the area is also mostly wetland and there are no major ports for Russia to offload troops/supplies. Second, Russia couldn't move out of there without invading Moldova because the stupid assholes blew up the only bridge between Odessa and SW Ukraine. Suppling them would be even worse and they'd probably run out of fuel and supplies in a week. 

 My best armchair general guess that this is a feint to keep Ukrainian forces put around Odessa while the offensives in the Donbass and S. Ukraine are ongoing and just generally stir up some shit.

This comes after Russian energy giant Gazprom halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on Wednesday, after both countries refused to pay the Russian energy giant in rubles, the company said in a statement. 

In a statement, von der Leyen called it “another provocation from the Kremlin"" and accused Moscow of using gas to ""blackmail"" the bloc.

""This is something the European Commission has been preparing for, in close coordination and solidarity with Member States and international partners. Our response will be immediate, united and coordinated,"" she said in a statement. “First, we will ensure that Gazprom’s decision has the least possible impact on European consumers. Today, Member States met in the Gas Coordination Group. Poland and Bulgaria updated us on the situation. Both Poland and Bulgaria are now receiving gas from their EU neighbours.""

The official also stressed the need for reliable energy partners, promising the end of the era of Russian fossil fuels in Europe.

Further in her statement, she committed to ensuring a plan for the ""medium term"" for sufficient gas supply and storage, and also looked forward to investing in a ""green transition.""

“In the longer term, REPowerEU will also help us move to a more reliable, secure and sustainable energy supply. We will present our plans to speed up the green transition in mid-May.

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy and Josh Pennington

The Belgorod region, which neighbors Ukraine, is extending its high ""terrorist danger"" security level status through May 10, according to a notice published on a local government website.

The yellow security status — which has been in place since April 10 — is the second-highest alert level, as it signifies authorities have information suggesting the real possibility of a terrorist act, according to the Russian government. 

The regional government is asking citizens in the region to not attend mass gatherings and to bring their identification documents when they go out. Setting off firecrackers and fireworks is also forbidden by the order.  

The extension comes as a fire broke out Wednesday at an ammunition depot in the village of Staraya Nelidovka, which is about 10 miles south of the city of Belgorod. It's unclear how that fire began, but several military installations in the region have caught fire or exploded since the war in Ukraine began.

*(PONARS Eurasia Policy Memo) President Vladimir Putin has successfully mobilized a sense of militant patriotism in the Russian public to wage war in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s propaganda builds on seeing Russia as both victimized by the West and entitled to regional dominance in the former Soviet territories. In such Russian imperial imagination, enforcing the Russian language, culture, and rule on non-Russian populations is not colonialism but a gift of greatness. Critics among intellectual and liberal elites in Russia condemn the regime but tend to shy away from questioning Russia’s imperial identity. To solve Russia’s antagonistic relations with its neighbors, both the Russian state and society need to confront their country’s imperial identity.*

and some individual news article)

You can see a pattern of countries who have similar equipment to Ukraine, can actually help more with their existing weapon systems. Other countries can support more in other areas like infantry weapons/protection/ammunition and ""normal"" easy-to-use vehicles. Only for a few systems like drones and artillery they are actively training Ukrainian soldiers on non-Soviet hardware. Training for anything that takes months, like tanks, helicopter, jets doesn't seem suitable or useful yet.

And a side note; Meanwhile the second biggest economy in the world, China, can only offer \~ 2 million $ in humanitarian aid. Even the smallest unaffiliated countries like Qatar or Azerbaijan do more than double of that. It is a total joke and will be used as an excuse by them to say they did something.

Russia's advantage was always to destroy everything from far away, either with artillery and airstrikes and force negotiations in their favor by doing so, they hate the infantry vs infantry fight. This will get challenged by sending so much artillery and anti-air capability besides all those portable anti-air / anti-tank infantry missiles. /armchair general mode off

A Ukrainian oligarch who made his fortune with help from the Kremlin is now denouncing President Vladimir Putin.

Speaking to NBC News while under house arrest in Austria, billionaire Dmytro Firtash said the Russian leader cannot win in Ukraine.

""He is never going to come out victorious,"" he said.

""No matter what happens, Russia will lose.""

Mr Firtash made his fortune selling Russian natural gas to Ukraine and is now fighting extradition to the US where he is facing conspiracy and bribery charges. He has been under house arrest for the past eight years.

He warned Mr Putin: ""It is time to stop. There will be no victory. The longer the war takes, the worse it will be for the Russian people, not just the Ukrainian people.""

His denouncement follows Oleg Tinkov, an oligarch who called Moscow's ""massacre"" in Ukraine an ""insane war"". Oleg Deripaska has also called for an end to the war, without directly criticising Putin.

""In Transnistria, there are reports of shots in the area of ​​warehouses with Russian weapons
OLENA ROSHCHINA - WEDNESDAY, APRIL 27, 2022, 10:40

In unrecognized Transnistria in Moldova, a shooting was reported near warehouses near the village of Kolbasna.

Source:  "" Transnistrian News "", "" Interfax "", so-called "" Ministry of Internal Affairs of Transnistria ""

Literally : ""There are reports of shootings in the area of ​​warehouses near the village of Kolbasna. There are no victims. We are finding out the details.""

Details: ""Interfax"" clarifies that the shooting took place near warehouses with Russian weapons and ammunition.

The so-called ""Ministry of Internal Affairs of Transnistria"" stated that several drones were allegedly fired over the village of Kolbasna at night, allegedly launched ""from Ukraine"", and at 8:45 am ""shots were fired from the Ukrainian side in the direction of the Transnistrian settlement of Kolbasna.""

They stressed that ""the largest ammunition depot in Europe"" is located in the village of Kolbasna.

Information about the victims as of 10.00 was not received.

Reference : Kolbasna (Kobasna) is a village in the Rybnitsa district of Moldova (the so-called ""Transnistrian Moldavian Republic"").

Prehistory:

On April 25-26, three series of explosions took place in Transnistria, as a result of which the authorities of the unrecognized Transnistrian Moldavian Republic ""introduced a"" red level of terrorist threat "". 
The head of unrecognized Transnistria, Vadym Krasnosilsky, said that ""traces of terrorist attacks lead to Ukraine."" Moldovan President Maya Sandu said the blasts were linked to forces inside Transnistria. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia is trying to destabilize the situation in Transnistria against the background of the war in Ukraine.

According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, units of the task force of Russian troops in Transnistria have been brought into full combat readiness. And Ukrainian intelligence has learned that Transnistrians receive fake SMS allegedly from the Armed Forces with a warning of a missile strike. 

The Russian Foreign Ministry has stated that it would like to avoid involving Transnistria in the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine expressed support for the territorial integrity of Moldova and condemned Russia's attempts to involve Transnistria in the war against Ukraine.""

So when you hear that Ukraine has taken back some of the villages near Kherson, but that they're still not really on the brink of retaking Kherson, that's why - because those towns aren't really critical progress points to retaking Kherson.

Russian gas supplies to Poland were halted briefly on Wednesday, data from the European Union gas transmission operators showed, raising fears Russia may turn off the gas taps to Ukraine's allies in what it calls ""gas blackmail"".

Both Poland and Bulgaria, both NATO and EU members, had earlier said Russia would stop supplying gas to them on Wednesday, amid a deepening the rift between Europe and Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine has accused Russia of blackmailing Europe over energy in an attempt to break its allies, as fighting heads into a third month without Russia capturing a major city.

Staunch Kremlin opponent Poland is among the European countries seeking the toughest sanctions against Russia for invading its neighbour.

The European Union network of gas transmission operators said gas to Poland was cut briefly, but later restored, and edged up after dropping to zero.

Russia moves down two weight classes to meet Ukraine who moved up two weight classes to fight Russia on no notice. Russia was ducking out everyone in their division, so Ukraine was picked as a mandatory.

Leading up to the fight, Russia had fired all of its good training team and replaced them with yes men. Because Russia was so damn big, everyone including Russia was extremely confident in a first, *maybe* second round KO/TKO. Like … why is this fight even taking place?

Russia’s Foreman-esque style had helped coin the phrase “never fight a land war with Russia in the winter” - slow, plodding forward, and with stupefying knockout power in both hands and a granite chin made Russia a problem in the HW division for decades. Like Foreman, Russia doesn’t have to be fast. The combination of bludgeoning power and the willingness to fight dirty (making the referee wonder if the opponent is being shoved, or actually punched) was enough. You could have forearms and shoulders blocking punches, but in round 5 or 6 you won’t be able to raise them. Enough to get the job done before the gas tank runs out in later rounds. And if there was anyone who knew their way around PEDs, it is Russia …

Ukraine’s style in combat is likened very much to the style of Lomachenko or Usyk (both current Ukrainian champions of boxing) - intellect first with slick, deceptive movements designed to always place the opponent at any available disadvantage, fighting in such a way as to take away tools from the opponent. When you learn to box in Ukraine like Lomachenko, you become unhittable by learning ballet dance as a child to enhance your footwork. You can seemingly appear and reappear at will, and your cardio knows no limits. You can hit as well as not getting hit, frustrating the opponent with death by a thousand cuts, a’la Muhammad Ali. Everyone remembers Ali’s ingenious “rope-a-dope” tactic, retreating into the ropes into a shelled-up high guard and let Foreman punch himself tired. In later rounds, Ali, still fresh, swarmed Foreman to win the fight.

Like Ali (and Lomachenko), subtle or overt trolling used at the *perfect* time with the *perfect* wording is a punch that keeps hitting long after the sting is gone. 

“I float like a butterfly, and sting like a bee.”

“I don’t need a ride, I need ammo.”

You’ve already lost the fight after hearing that.

Bullshit.

Every general on CNN in late February was saying Russia could not win with less than 200,000 troops. 

Hertling was repeatedly saying Russia needs “ten times those numbers” ...would talk about seize of Berlin and could bomb but won’t be able to seize and control; Petraus would talk about the extensive, elite training UA has been getting, and that Russia hasn’t correctly assessed their enemy; “spider” Marks would talk about the 5-to-1 requirement for battle-ready offense (some were saying 7-to-1 if military is full of unprepared conscripts) and Russia.  Then after the 24th, they all spoke logistics ad nauseum—but still none were saying Ukraine would lose.  They have all been saying, the entire time, Ukraine has pretty good chances on their side. 

But not just retired generals as pundants.  John Kirby made clear not only of a war, but a possible long war was “imminent.” Sullivan was on tv everyday telling Americans to get out, bc “this war would be fierce, and grueling and bloody and American Forces can not and will not come in to rescue you.”   So obviously Sullivan didn’t think Russia would win, or he would’ve said sit tight for two weeks and Russia will be in charge. Obviously Kirby didn’t think Ukraine would fold in a week. The US government obviously thought UA had good chances, or they’d be calling it something different (like “impending Russian takeover/annexation”).",False,1651117070.0,t3_ucurq6,t3_ucurq6,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

This would spell catastrophe for the remaining Russian forces in Ukraine, without their own national mobilization and constitution of fresh units. What's more, this defeat coming at the hands of only Ukrainian forces would be politically catastrophic for Vladimir Putin. 

To me, it's becoming clear that Putin may begin to seek face-saving solutions, and one of these potential solutions is to change the defeat narrative from a defeat at the hands of the Ukrainians, to a defeat by NATO. Towards this end, I believe Putin may attempt to drag allied troops into a direct conflict in Ukraine with the Russian military. How will Putin do this? He will need to cross a red line: chemical weapons, a nuclear ""demonstration shot,"" a cyber-warfare attack on critical Western infrastructure, or a direct attack on a NATO supply convoy or facility are all the type of action that would elicit a measured, proportional response from NATO that would not directly require a decapitation strike on Russian leadership.

I disagree. I don't think interest is fading, its normalizing.  This war, and our support for it, is becoming a part of our daily life not disappearing from it.

Mostly I've an American perspective on this because it's easier to follow domestic trends but I do feel like the majority of NATO is onboard as well.

First, lend-lease. It's a big deal, and it has huge bipartisan support.  Political support for Ukraine had strong Democratic and Republican consensus, which in itself is incredible in 2022.

Second, I'm not going to search for it, but a recent poll showed about 75 percent of US population supports American support for Ukraine. That's insane.

I think in part this is because the older generations (often unwilling to change their opinions) where brought up with Russia as the default ""bad guy"".

While younger generations didn't have this indoctrination we're also much more apt to change our minds when presented with overwhelming evidence.  Which Russia has supplied in the form of invasion, indiscriminate rape, torture, and murder (Fuck Putin). Before Crimea I would've said Russia was just another European country a little behind the economic curve (yeah I was wrong).

In addition this is our military industrial complexes dream scenario.  A proxy war with Russia, not a Russian proxy actual motherf##king Russia, where we are arming the incredibly sympathetic and effective Ukrainians with our weapons which are blowing to pieces the best Russian equipment available. So our weapons get credit but none of our soldiers are at risk.

Our defense industry will have a huge windfall, I mean is India going to want Russian equipment after this? Can Russia even build tanks after this? India has nearly 1.4 billion people and they can't buy from China so that leaves Western companies.  Our military companies wouldn't let support fade the power of their lobby is way too strong in Washington.

So its a winning issue socially, politically, economically, and morally.

Interest is not fading it's just normalizing. The Wests support is going no where.

If you subscribe to war channels on Telegram, or accounts on Twitter, it’s hard to avoid seeing pictures of dead people on the battlefield, pictures that essentially force a sobering reality onto you—just how barbaric the murder and destruction of it all truly is. 

The dead bodies and vacant stares of Ukrainians or hell, even Russians, were once men who were their proud mothers’ little boys years ago. Men who had the potential to live for many, many more years before a bullet or artillery round separated their souls from their bodies. Men who had hopes and dreams of being a war hero with medals, or a life-saving doctor after years of residency, or a proud father with a loving family, or hell, even just another goofball playing video games with his buddies.  

But instead, those men meet their ends at age eighteen or twenty or twenty-eight on dirty mud or grass, or in a vehicle set ablaze. And… it’s so hard to understand how so many of the followers of those online channels or accounts don’t feel overwhelmed and not want to cry. It’s so senseless. 

For dead Russians, the delight many have at the sights of their deaths is almost understandable, but only almost. Even though we usually have no idea who the men behind the vacant eyes were, or what their actual goals were, there’s a sense of righteous justice for the mass destruction and murder of innocent civilians by an army with boots on uninvited soil. 

But with dead Ukrainians, how? It’s pure evil to cheer at all. Even I can’t start to understand at all, and I’ve tried to see through the other side’s eyes with all the propaganda clouding their own truth. The Ukrainian men were only defending themselves from those aggressors who instigated the war to start with. A war that was forced onto those innocent men by someone else not even representing their country, on that person’s own selfish terms. 

Fuck Putin for starting this. Forcing immeasurable destruction and pain upon Ukraine. Immeasurable grief and agony upon Ukrainian and Russian mothers. 

It doesn’t stop there though. Putin is just one man, and clearly, there are countless others like him. Syria. Libya. Afghanistan. Other countries and territories like Palestine. The rights of lands, the hopes and dreams of men, the love of mothers—all of them—crushed, broken, dead.

That said, some people might be surprised to know that the US is widely reckoned to have incredible first strike capability, partly due to its balance of forces, partly due to its amazing intelligence services. I think the canonical statement of this “US nuclear primacy” view was [Lieber and Press](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/is3004_advanceproof_lieberandpress.pdf) back in 2006, but the US has considerably increased its first strike capabilities recently with [the new superfuzes](https://thebulletin.org/2017/03/how-us-nuclear-force-modernization-is-undermining-strategic-stability-the-burst-height-compensating-super-fuze).

This may seem like good news for the West, but it also creates a dilemma for the US. Let’s say that Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the West responds with a no-fly zone, and Russia starts talking about nuclear escalation. We then get good intelligence that a limited Russian nuclear strike on NATO targets is imminent. Should the US move to protect its allies in that situation with a massive first strike against Russian military targets - silos, ICBMs, command centres, sub-bases - in the hope of radically degrading their nuclear strike capability? Or should we “wait and see”, and risk a large-scale Russian surprise attack, potentially against civilian targets?

Russia should be very careful here. Past a certain point of rhetoric and action, the West will respond in kind, if necessary with overwhelming force. But let us all pray it does not come to that.",False,1651087321.0,t3_ucurq6,t3_ucurq6,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

""27/04/2022 Information on the suspension of natural gas supplies under the Yamal contract
Polskie Górnictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA announces that natural gas supplies supplied by Gazprom under the Yamal contract have been completely suspended. Currently, the situation does not affect the current supplies to PGNiG customers who receive fuel in accordance with their demand.

Despite the fulfillment of all obligations under the Yamal contract by PGNiG, on April 27 this year. Gazprom has stopped delivering natural gas to which it is obliged under this contract and PGNiG's nomination.

In the opinion of PGNiG, the limitation of natural gas supplies is a breach of the Yamal contract. PGNiG reserves the right to pursue claims in connection with the suspension of deliveries and will use all contractual rights vested in the company and rights under the law.

According to the information provided by Gazprom to PGNiG, it suspended supplies in connection with the provisions of the decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 172 of March 31, 2022, ""On the special procedure for fulfilling obligations of foreign buyers towards Russian natural gas suppliers"".

The decree has resulted in an attempt to introduce an obligation for some of Gazprom's contractors to keep settlement accounts with a bank within the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation and to make final payments for the gas supplied in Russian rubles. After a thorough analysis of the decree, the Management Board of PGNiG rejected such proposed settlement terms as inconsistent with the applicable provisions of the Yamal contract and decided to settle payments in accordance with the existing rules specified in the contract.

Currently, despite Gazprom's cessation of deliveries, PGNiG's customers receive gas in accordance with their demand.

Thanks to the consistent implementation by PGNiG and GAZ-SYSTEM of the strategy of diversifying the sources and directions of gas supplies to Poland, PGNiG has various possibilities of obtaining it. The company has the opportunity to purchase gas from both the European Union, thanks to connections with Germany and the Czech Republic, and the international LNG market through the terminal in Świnoujście, whose regasification capacity has been increased this year. An important source of natural gas is also extraction from domestic deposits, and an additional safeguard of the possibility of satisfying internal demand are gas storage facilities in Poland, which are currently injected and are currently filled to about 80 percent.

PGNiG is in constant contact with OGP GAZ-SYSTEM SA, which is responsible for the safe operation of the transmission infrastructure in Poland. The companies are monitoring the situation and will keep the market updated.""

The sanctions imposed are hitting the European and overseas economies more painfully every day, while the Russian economy is holding up much better.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

the total was like $11.00, so he hands her a 9 while telling her to ""keep the change"". (?????).

After ""paying"", he proceeded to leave the store as if we all owed him a huge favor and threw all the milkyWays into the garbage. i haven't seen him since.

Usually these sort of op-eds are written by crackpots but in this case it's someone with an intimate knowledge of Putin. When the people who know Putin say that he'll never give up, it's a bit of a scary thought. No death toll is too much. 

Excerpt:

> Further arming Ukraine will only destroy it. The west must act to end this war now
> 
> Few people in the west doubt that Ukraine is fighting a just war. Russia’s invasion was entirely unprovoked. Whatever complaints it may have had about Nato expansion or Ukraine’s mistreatment of Russians in Donbas, nobody had attacked Russia, and nobody was planning to. Vladimir Putin launched a straightforward war of aggression and territorial conquest.
> 
> It follows that supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do. But it is not at all clear that the kind of support we are giving (and not giving) is the right way to go about preserving the Ukrainian nation.
> 
> The longer this war rages on, the more Ukrainians will flee their homeland, and the more devastation will be wrought upon their homes, cities, industry and economy. Yet the west’s current approach of supporting Ukraine’s war aim of defeating the aggressor, and providing arms for that purpose while pointedly avoiding direct military intervention, is guaranteed to prolong the war. Russia’s progress may be slowed, but it’s highly unlikely to be stopped, far less pushed out of Ukraine, and in the meantime the grinding destruction and hideous war crimes will continue.
> 
> No day goes past without some senior western politician proclaiming that Ukraine will be “successful” and that Russia is “failing”. This is certainly morale-boosting. But it is clearly nonsense.
> 
> The fact is, day by day, more towns and cities are destroyed and then fall to the Russians. In two months, the area under Russian control – originally just the breakaway parts of Donbas – has grown to perhaps five times the size. If Russia continues to suffer “defeats” at this pace, then in another two months the entire south of Ukraine will be in ruins, cities such as Odesa will resemble Mariupol, and thousands upon thousands more Ukrainians will have died.

Writer bio:

For three years from 2006, he worked for GPlus, a Brussels-based public relations company, as an adviser to the Russian government.

From 2009 to 2011, he worked on a second BBC series about Russia, titled Putin, Russia and the West, and wrote a book, The Strongman: Vladimir Putin and the Struggle for Russia. In a February 2012 article in The Daily Telegraph, journalist Peter Oborne criticised Roxburgh's involvement in the programme, saying that it led to an imbalance in favour of Putin: ""I have no doubt that [Roxburgh] is a man of integrity, but it is profoundly shocking that the BBC should even have considered using him, given the nature of his previous employment."" The BBC issued a statement in response, which said: ""Angus Roxburgh was once a PR advisor to the Kremlin. He was also a Sunday Times correspondent, and later the BBC’s Moscow correspondent. That is why he was hired: he helped secure interviews with key Kremlin insiders."" The series was widely praised and won several prizes, including a Peabody award. Roxburgh's book, The Strongman, was shortlisted for International Affairs Book of the Year (2013)and was described by the Telegraph as ""fair, nuanced and well-written.

Russia hasn't even rotated some of the troops from the North back into Eastern Ukraine. Without reinforcing those troops the current battle lines are basically the end of this war regardless of the outcome, as Russia has not even began to mobalize broader troops domestically. Even if they take the east, the troops they have probably can't defend it unless Putins plan is to declare it Russia/independent and then make some insane nuclear threats over ""their territory"". To be honest, as I type this, it makes sense and seems almost likely. 

On the other hand, if Putin is actually counting on a deal (which actually seems to be the case based on overall actions) the constant denied requests for humanitarian corridors to Mariupol make absolutely no sense. If Bucha was the reason for the original peace talks breaking down, the atrocities in Mariupol are probably several magnitudes worse and will eventually get revealed. 

Otherwise, Putin really still must be getting some terrible Intel from his people or the state of the rest of the Russian military is actually in that poor of shape that they have literally nothing left for this conflict even if they had men.

The EU basically capitulated and said companies can pay how Russia wanted, and Reuters framed it like the EU came up with something on their own to avoid Russian demands.

>EU says pay for Russian gas in euros to avoid breaching sanctions

> **EU companies may be able to work around Russia's demand to receive gas payments in roubles without breaching sanctions if they pay in euros or dollars which are then converted into the Russian currency**, the European Commission said on Friday.

>Moscow has warned Europe it risks having gas supplies cut unless it pays in roubles. **In March it issued a decree proposing that energy buyers open accounts at Gazprombank to make payments in euros or dollars, which would then be converted to roubles.**

-

>Brussels said in the document that there were options that could allow companies to continue lawfully paying for gas.

>""EU companies can ask their Russian counterparts to fulfil their contractual obligations in the same manner as before the adoption of the decree, i.e. by depositing the due amount in euros or dollars,"" the document said.

>However, the procedure for securing exemptions from the requirements of the decree is not yet clear, it said.

>**Before making payments, EU operators could also make a clear statement that they consider their contractual obligations to be completed when they deposit euros or dollars with Gazprombank - as opposed to later, after the payment is converted into roubles, the document said.**

*Does this mean that the military or the FSB has concluded that the war, with its enormous casualties and incompetent direction, was a mistake? The short answer is no, quite the opposite.*  
  
*Russia’s military believes that limiting the war’s initial goals is a serious error. They now argue that Russia is not fighting Ukraine, but NATO. Senior officers have therefore concluded that the Western alliance is fighting all out (through the supply of increasingly sophisticated weaponry) while its own forces operate under peacetime constraints like a bar on airstrikes against some key areas of Ukraine’s infrastructure. In short, the military now demands all-out war, including mobilization.*  
  
*The frustration is becoming so intense that it has spilled over into the public space.  Alexander Arutyunov (aka, the blogger RAZVEDOS), a well-known veteran of Spetsnaz of the National Guard, made a video plea to Putin: ""Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich, please decide, are we fighting a war or are we masturbating?""*  
  
*He demanded a massive escalation, with a choice of airstrikes on Ukrainian  infrastructure or an end to the war. The video went viral, especially with pro-military groups on VKontakte \[the Russian equivalent to Facebook\] and Telegram channels affiliated with the Russian army.*  
  
*The telegram channel “FighterBomber” associated with the Russian air force, posted on April 12 a comment about NATO’s weapon supplies to Ukraine: “Naturally, we’ll further increase air defense units on the border with Ukraine in order to cover our territory from ballistic missile strikes, but it is also clear that NATO countries have far more weapons than Russia.”*  
  
*The author expressed optimism that the Russian air force will be able to staunch the flow of Western supplies but warned that further Ukrainian victories “will almost certainly prompt the use of nuclear weapons” against targets in Ukraine.*  
  
*And then on April 22, Russian army General Rustam Minnekayev announced a second phase of the “special operation” which would aim to “establish full control over the Donbas and Southern Ukraine.*  
  
*“This will provide a land corridor to the Crimea as well as influence the vital objects of the Ukrainian economy,” Minnekayev said, according to Russian wire agencies. “Control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria \[the Russian-garrisoned breakaway region of Moldova\], where there are also facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population.”*  
  
*This was odd. Minnekayev is Deputy Commander of the Central Military District, and he made his remarks at the annual meeting of the Union of Defense Industries, of all places. The most plausible explanation was that having recently attended General Staff meetings, he became over-excited at what he had heard, and then revealed the news at the first public meeting thereafter.

It doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever to use them, as I agree with pretty much every other commenter here when this topic comes up. Simply put, I have made several comments regarding the difference in how 'strategy' or 'tactics' are viewed from Russia to basically what I consider, the rest of the world, i.e. the civilized world.

At the outset of this, I believe they will extinguish every single option they have militarily before considering any of this.

>Which brings me back to my point - the only way nuclear weapons could be used in this war is to kill a lot of people or to show resolve to do so 

This is exactly in line with why I would think Russia would use them. They are continually losing in a fight to Ukraine. They know that if any other combatants enter it is a certainty that Russia will lose. Still, they choose to rape, pillage, and bomb civilians intentionally and relentlessly. 

They aim to destroy. That is the goal. To that end I believe them fully capable to use these weapons, albeit currently unwilling to as they've deluded themselves into believing they will win this somehow and things will seemingly 'go back to normal'. If they are pushed to the absolute brink of failure and Ukraine is back upon their immediate Western border again, having retaken the Donbas region, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they interpret that as Ukraine wanting to invade Russia proper. They keep alluding to this by way of 'existential conflict/threat', which we all know wouldn't have a chance of happening as NO ONE wants to invade Russia, but given the context we are currently in, combined with how they misinterpret known fact for political ploys at home, I don't see it as an impossibility that they would view a Ukraine advance into the Donbas as a staging ground to then assault Russia. All that before reminding ourselves that they currently view this fight as against NATO (whether that's to soften the loss at home is a topic for another discussion) and are somehow convinced NATO wants to invade Russia. 

Tactically, logistically, economically, fucking even just in context of in deeming pure sanity or not, this makes absolute zero sense for any of us in the West to consider as something Ukraine should or would do. But time and time again Russia is hellbent on reminding everyone that they do not think, plan, or act as we in the West do. They convince themselves this is a holy war. That there are drugged out Nazis closing in on their country. That gay orgies and 'liberal chaos' must be constrained, lest it poison the greatness of the Russian people. Hell, even the fucking borscht shit we heard about weeks ago. It already is existential to them. 

And I think Putin is crazy enough to do it. I want to be wrong, and really hope I am.

>So this analyst is Grigory Yudin, who I think is very insightful. And I think that he is attentive, right? Good analysts are - they largely earned their stripes by just really paying close attention to what is being said and done. And Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons for a long, long time. This is another strain of thought and action that we have observed over the years. Russia has changed its military doctrine to make it easier to use nuclear weapons. And this happened many years ago. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world, and in particular the United States, that Russia is a nuclear power.

>And, you know, I don't know that I agree with Yudin that the first target would be the United States and, in particular, New York City. I think that Putin is much more likely and has given indications on this and also seeing indications of this in the way that the Russian state television narrative is working - I think it's much more likely that they would use a tactical nuclear weapon to target, say, a military airport in Poland.

I'd love to hear them have a conversation. Nuke or no nuke, it all turns on putin.

It's similar to trump losing an election. Is he capable of just admitting defeat and moving on? Nope. What he did was hold a rally and then urge the rallygoers to go to the Capitol to fight like hell - which they literally did. The goon still doesn't admit defeat, even after losing something like 59 out of 60 election related lawsuits. 

What's an ego like  putin's do when faced with losing a war (to be clear, all Ukraine has to do to avoid losing is to continue existence)?

According to Rummel, this definition covers a wide range of deaths, including forced labor and concentration camp victims, killings by mercenaries and unofficial private groups, extrajudicial summary killings, and mass deaths due to governmental acts of criminal omission and neglect, such as in deliberate famines like the Holodomor, as well as killings by de facto governments, i. e. killings during a civil war.

Good analysts are - they largely earned their stripes by just really paying close attention to what is being said and done. And Putin has been threatening to use nuclear weapons for a long, long time. This is another strain of thought and action that we have observed over the years. Russia has changed its military doctrine to make it easier to use nuclear weapons. And this happened many years ago. Putin has repeatedly reminded the world, and in particular the United States, that Russia is a nuclear power.

>And, you know, I don't know that I agree with Yudin that the first target would be the United States and, in particular, New York City. I think that Putin is much more likely and has given indications on this and also seeing indications of this in the way that the Russian state television narrative is working - I think it's much more likely that they would use a tactical nuclear weapon to target, say, a military airport in Poland.

If you assume fewer missiles and worse intelligence, Russia would have had an easier time encircling Kyiv and cities in the east. Counterattacks on convoys would have been less effective. The war would become Mariupol several times over.

Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manatoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a safety shutoff switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told coworkers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip to forty below zero.

Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic.

Baker's body was discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded.""

a97a8ce135530f1b786117db088ed8e1,ucurq6,i6d9tfp,"Nah, not just money. I'm in Eastern Europe, my whole family older than 40 grew up in the Soviet Union, and here's what I've learned from my Russian friends as well as just dad.

It's not just money. It's instability and a power vacuum.

**Instability:** Putin provides it. Sure, life under him has become total shit and tomorrow's gonna be worse than today, but at least you can predict what's going to happen tomorrow. It's a steady downhill rolling. People, including Russian people, don't like surprises in their lives, and a coup, violent or not, would lead to a power vacuum in Russia, or a revolving door of governments disposed of one after another as self-styled warlords, political or otherwise, all vie for the throne, or more precisely, the position behind the throne because whoever's on the throne's gonna get killed or ousted by contenders.

**Power vacuum:** here's the revolving door thing. You know how when a powerful mafia suddenly is rendered powerless by death of the don? War breaks out in the criminal underworld. It's why it's often in police's best interest to actually keep the head of a criminal organization intact, and hamper him and his efforts otherwise, or to make a deal. A lot of really bad people are currently alive and in power both in the governments of the world, as well as the underworld, because disposing of them would be *worse,* if you can believe it.

So, given that Russia is a mafia state, and another, much more alarming thing: Putin has removed everybody who could pose threat to him besides a possible successor, Russian people have a big problem. For them right now it's do and die, or don't do and die, but in the latter case you'll at least die slower, because it's, again, predictable.

Putin's successor's issue is that he won't have the loyalty and/or influence over the rest of the government and all the rich people. He won't even have the pull Putin has among the populace, because Putin lifted Russia out of the absolutely horrid conditions for the 90s, and so he'll always be a hero in most of the country's eyes. Whoever succeeds him will quickly have to secure another feat for Russia, and I'm afraid that this time it'll likely be a militaristic feat. Because sanctions getting lifted will not be certainty even if Russia capitulates and cedes all territory it's annexed from Ukraine. This is an ugly position to be in. Sanctions aren't ending, and their effects are already going to last for a decade if not two, you cannot take that back even if you ended all sanctions today. You also lost the war in Ukraine and had to cede those territories. NATO won, in the eyes of Russians, and Russians, brainwashed and stoked to rage and xenophobia, will be convinced that this is it for them, that any day NATO will roll in and shoot one baby and rape one woman for every baby and woman NATO *alleges* that was killed and/or raped in Ukraine, you know, just as an excuse to exterminate Russian ethnicity and state off the planet. And you, Putin's successor, are in charge of dealing with that fucking mess. There's just no way to save face except maybe lock the country down further and keep lying to the people so that they don't know how fucking bad they really have it. Boil a frog kind of thing. Or get desperate and in one final hail mary slash fuck you, it's carrying out a nuclear attack because if it's death anyway, then let it be a death to put fear in the lives of the few who'll survive and procreate for a thousand years.

Except Putin's plan fucking failed, and now even the heir apparent is probably shaking in his boots. If Putin is killed, that sets a precedent. It's open season on *anybody* now, especially the guy who will end up on Putin's throne. Another war, a much more bitter but hidden war will be waged for the position of the man behind the new leader. That way you're far less exposed, but just as powerful. Anything shit happens and Russians will be unhappy? New leader gets to eat that shit. World is angry at Russia? New leader. Because people are stupid, and they are just as stupid in the West as they are in Russia. They act on emotion, and can thus be easily swayed and appealed to. And since these people live in the moment, they will also direct their ire towards the most public face they see, first and foremost. You guessed it. New leader. Russian people. Other public, outspoken politicians. But you? You're avoiding most of the angry gaze of plebeians.

Putin isn't disposed of because people both in Russia and elsewhere, who aren't redditors, are legitimately and rightfully concerned by what will happen when Putin's dead through assassination. It's the unpredictability that sets these people on edge. It's not that the successor will be worse, even a worse dictator offers predictability. It's that when the civil war within government warlords start, **you don't know what the ruling faction du jour will do to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the public.** Because they have nukes. Or there will be a civil war, and despite redditors salivating for it, a civil war in Russia is bad news for Europe, and especially bad news for us hapless fucks sharing a border with Russia. And, of course, the fact that people who aren't redditors actually don't want to see several millions of Russians in Russia dead for revenge, as it's understood that revenge has no place in geopolitics... unless you want to gain popular support, of course. Revenge's an easy way to do it, because ordinary people fucking love revenge, and often confuse it with justice.

That's why Putin's still alive. Because the West at least has an idea of his behaviour, and his government, and can predict with some accuracy that action Putin will take. Putin, though he fucked up, doesn't need to really whip up popular support, he already has it, no matter what. To repeat, his successor won't have that support in such numbers. He'll always be discount Putin unless he does something *drastic* to restore Russian pride and sense of selves as powerful. And he'll need to do it fast. And he'll know that because the sanction bullet has already been fired, it will hit no matter what, even if the West puts the gun away, he can't bank on restoring economy. He can alleviate it, but that'll make him and Russia look like beaten dogs shivering and begging at the feet of the master. You have to remember that Russian people as a hole have not really had a time in history where they didn't suffer under a despot. During some of those times they had pride, identity, ideology, during others they had none. They've endured hunger and destitution before, because at least they had pride. But hunger and destitution and total Russian humiliation? Yeah. New guy needs to turn that ship around. And nobody wants to be the new guy, and nobody wants a new guy because it's *unpredictable.*

edit eesh, *sorr-eee* for speculating on why Putin remains in power. Putin is the devil the West knows. Putin capitulating would be the best ending for the West. If he doesn't capitulate, then wearing Russia down with Putin in charge is the 2nd best. Unless the West has a patsy in mind that it's 99.8% sure they can control and keep alive long enough to make any changes, that's also pretty good, but it's also a pipe dream. And a new guy with a lot to prove? Oh *shit.* Also yes, redditors. I've seen some of y'all straight up advocating for glassing Moscow as revenge.

So even getting spare parts for existing equipment will become increasingly difficult until domestic production can ramp up, if it even can be ramped up.

So sure, once Russia exhausts it's supply of modern munitions and equipment they could fall back on older dumber gear.  But they are already having a hell of a time with their best stuff presumably at peak readiness and supply.

On another note, you're absolutely correct that if we ignore loss of life, expertise, and equipment the daily cost of this invasion is certainly a fraction of what the west spent every day in the global war on terror.

This is the first long format interview I came across, and it’s incredible how much it humanises the “aggressors”. He seems like a decent guy trying to look out for himself without compromising his personal morals.    

If you can believe him, he at least sounds consistent. He goes to war and participates because it’s what he signed up for (as long as he cannot directly trace his actions to specific harm caused). His principles similarly won’t let him steal civilian clothing (which I got a sense was because he still saw himself as a member of the opposing “team”, not because he would find it harder to explain looting). Nor was he willing to scam individuals selling insurance. Turning in his vehicle for a reward got him interested, but also got a “no, I don’t think I’d be able to do that”, more as an issue of betrayal, than of logistics. 

He seemed most animated when talking about his trade. I think he would feel at home as a mechanic in a country that’s not Russia, where he could do honest work for a decent wage. Instead he nearly became sunflower fertilizer. Life is wild.",False,1651092552.0,t3_ucurq6,t1_i6fqjav,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

They outnumber Ukraine three to one on the current front line, with even better ratios for artillery, trained armor and air support. It would be weird if they weren't the ones pushing into new territory. 

But be careful of what you call a ""victory."" There's a lot happening that we can't see or know about. What looks like a victory, to either side, might not be clear cut.

Take a hypothetical example: Russia might attack a village in hopes of destroying a company of Ukrainian soldiers who had just fallen back after a successful raid. They focus a lot of resources to get overwhelming numerical superiority and they take the town. In the battle, however, the company of Ukrainians destroy half of the attacking force and eventually escapes with only modest casualties and succeeds at evacuating the civilian population, and falls back to a stronger defensive position. On the map, the Russians are shown to advance.

Meanwhile, in another hypothetical battle, the Russians attack a settlement and the Ukrainians repel the attack, but at grievous cost. They reinforce heavily but keep losing men and materiel that is hard for them to replace at the moment - at least until new units are trained on western equipment. The Ukrainians here lose twenty tanks, four howitzers and hundreds of men - mostly to artillery. They hold the town, but the Russians can keep pounding with artillery and keep grinding the defenders indefinitely, at little cost to themselves. On the map, the Ukrainians are shown to hold the settlement.

From the map alone, the first battle looks like a Russian victory. The second battle looks like a Ukrainian victory. Would you say that this is an accurate characterization, though? 

Short of massive or obvious game changers and major strategic objectives (the Azovstal Plant, Izium, Kyiv, Kherson etc.) we can't really tell from just a map who is ""winning"" and who is ""losing"".

Any gunnery, land and sea, is more about keeping the enemy moving than it is about scoring kills.  It's when the enemy falls under a barrage and doesn't move that the dying happens.  Modern gunnery gives them less time to get under way but artillery is still ineffective against moving targets.

Sure, artillery likely isn't accurate enough to score kills on seaborne targets because of how easily they can move.  But if the goal is to GET a target moving and stop it from getting comfortable enough to obtain an easy fix on land targets, yeah, artillery can get that done even if the target is seaborne.

Also don't underestimate land based artillery shells.  Modern warships aren't the armored monsters their predecessors were and penetrations, fires and flooding are all very possible with a direct hit from a good old fashioned one-five-five.  So a 155mm gun is more than enough of a threat to most warshhips to get their attention and force them to go evasive.

Besides, the active defenses on modern warships may have trouble with ballistic shells.  They're mostly designed to detect and intercept missiles, not ballistic weaponry.  A full barrage may overwhelm their interception capability.  Sometimes going old school can grant you an advantage, if the old tech still works and defenses have stopped bothering with it.  That's why trucks with 20mm autocannons have beaten armies with tanks in the past.

Also I wouldn't worry too much about return fire.  Most likely whatever's out there is saving its ammunition for something important, especially because Russia has trouble replacing its ammunition.  If your artiillery chief knows what he's doing he can unload a few rounds and decamp before the ship based radar, which likely isn't designed for ballistic tracking of a large number of incoming shells but instead for individual missile based attacks, can get a lock on his position, and the Russian navy is going to want a good lock before they spend irreplaceable weapons trying to deal with you.

Most likely they'll just retreat out of your artillery's range.  Which is what you want them to do anyway and a good use of your plentiful artillery if the goal is to make the Black Sea fleet just that little bit more wary.",1651065721.0,1651065238.0,t3_ucurq6,t1_i6e8f4k,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

Yeah, of course Russia is fairing better. They thought they were going on parade and stumbled into a war instead. Their initial tactics, positions and losses were horrendous. They have consolidated and are now making more strategic pushes, clearly that is going to work better. Additionally, we're at the start of an offensive, they are now committing a lot of resources so it makes sense they are gaining land, but the real question here is whether they can hold it or not.

If Ukraine can hold out for another 2-3 weeks without major defeats, such as the Russians breaking through defensive lines, suddenly the game looks different again. At that point, with the current rate of losses on the Russian side, they will have lost too much combat power to effectively continue this push. They would need another pause and reconstitute, at which point the Ukrainians can counter-attack again.

The point is not to look at how the lines on the map are moving on a daily basis, but to see the overall picture. Ukrainians now want to hold the line as best as possible, attrit the Russians from defensive positions and retreat with minimal losses where necessary, while hitting the Russian supply lines and allowing their offensive to exhaust itself. 

That doesn't mean the Ukrainians are automatically going to win, it just means that the Russians advancing slowly right now is not a cause for extreme worry. If they can keep this up and after 3 weeks are still pushing, gaining victories, cutting off Ukrainian positions, then we can say their offensive has been successful, but right now - it's way to early to say how it's going one way or another based on publicly available information.",False,1651082016.0,t3_ucurq6,t1_i6fdive,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

 >KVN (Russian: КВН, an abbreviation of Клуб весёлых и находчивых, Klub Vesyólykh i Nakhódchivykh or Ka-Ve-En, ""Club of the Funny and Inventive"") is a Russian (and formerly Soviet) humour TV show and an international competition where teams (usually composed of college students) compete by giving funny answers to questions and showing prepared sketches. The Club originated in the Soviet Union, building on the popularity of an earlier program, An Evening of Funny Questions (Russian: Вечер весёлых вопросов, romanized: Vecher vesyolykh voprosov); the television programme first aired on the First Soviet Channel on November 8, 1961.

That's not correct: Gazprom converting its Euros to Roubles has the same impact on the respective currencies as anyone else doing it.  However, forcing the customer to perform the conversion does prevent Gazprom from hiding foreign currency from the Russian government/not converting it to Roubles, so that could be a motive.

Otherwise, requiring customers to pay in Roubles does not in and of itself make a great deal of difference.  Were the pricing to be set in Roubles (which would likely be a future step taken after settlement in Roubles is established) it would shift the exchange rate risk from Gazprom to its customers; but for the time being, I believe Russia's proposal is to accept the Rouble amount of the agreed Dollar/Euro price—so the exchange rate risk remains with them.

> Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force. Once an attacker has lost momentum or is forced to spread out to pacify a large area, defensive counter-attacks can be mounted on the attacker's weak points, with the goal being to cause attrition or drive the attacker back to its original starting position.

So, although I’m a first born US citizen, my family has told me about how shitty life was in the Soviet Union. And I get how Russian citizens haven’t really recovered from that time ( they started, but yeah… Putin ).

I don’t necessarily agree with you that Putin has public support. I think it’s hard for Russians to ignore what’s happening due to social media; but the problem is what you touched upon earlier. The longer this war goes on, the easier it would be for Russians to think it’s the fault of the West for their economic problems. When, in fact, the sanctions started because of Putins decision to invade.

I’m not an expert in any of this. However, I still feel like Putin won’t be alive at the end of this. He seems insane enough to do something so dumb, eventually, that someone will off him.

Might take a while though. Might not happen at all.

 >Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force.

This was partially to provide a nuclear umbrella over its allies in NATO as a deterrent against a conventional Warsaw Pact attack during the Cold War, and NATO continues to oppose a no-first-use policy.[27][41] Not only did the United States and NATO refuse to adopt a no first use policy, but until 1967 they maintained a nuclear doctrine of ""massive retaliation"" in which nuclear weapons would explicitly be used to defend North America or Western Europe against a conventional attack.

Where it gets spotty is that the Russian Central Bank is sanctioned, and they could potentially be the ones issuing the rubles which euros or dollars are converted into. That is, instead of Gazprombank getting foreign currency to play with, the Russian Central Bank could end up with that foreign currency to put in their reserves.

Under Lend Lease the only way you'd get a debt is if you keep the surviving equipment for use after the war. If the equipment is destroyed or sent back to the U.S. after the war or in the case of munitions or consumables they are not expected to be paid back and thus do not contribute to the debt. Basically this made most of the supplies and equipment though Lend Lease free. The U.S. did start charging for supplies after the war ended at a 90% discounted rate but technically that isn't part of Lend Lease.

Initially anarchic, during the Hungarian Uprising the Hungarian people culminated in protests against domestic policies imposed by the USSR, and the people formed together in protest against the Soviet Union.

The largest anti-government protests in the history of Belarus, the demonstrations began in the lead-up to and during the 2020 presidential election, in which Lukashenko sought his sixth term in office. In response to the demonstrations, a number of relatively small pro-government rallies were held. The protests intensified nationwide after the official election results were announced on the night of 9 August, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner.

Putin has repeatedly made this comment about how they are definitively not like us in this regard (as well as many others). 

Yes. I think their pride would lead them to think they can erase the West, which they view as this gay orgy, drug laden, evil (in terms of their whacked religious views) entity that they need to defeat. That, coupled with the fact that suffering and struggling are embedded into their cultural identity, I think they see themselves as being capable of surviving anything and would eventually ""reclaim"" their status, despite the obvious uphill battle of total planetwide apocalypse that would result from a nuclear war. 

It's unthinkable for those of us in the west (China too, hence why they're lately telling Russia to cool off in regards in nukes), but Russia just thinks entirely differently, and it's made for a big, increasingly widening gap of trying to understand the different thought processes between what I frankly view as the civilized world, and Russia.

To top that all off, I really don't see **anything** the West could give Russia, outside of blood and death of innocents, so if you accept in any form what I speculated on above, and remove the possibility of any diplomatic negotiations ending this conflict, it sadly makes sense, that we are slowly inching more and more towards the possibility of it happening.

 >Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force.

For what it's worth, and I'm always open to corrections and being properly informed, but as to Russia's nuclear firing command: I believe it's broken into 3 authorizations pertaining to the President, the Defense Minister Shoigu, and Chief of General Staff Gerasimov. In essence, alike to our Biden, Secretary Austin, and General Milley. 

So as long as Shoigu isn't down and out due to another ""mysterious"" heart attack and the authentication needs him to be conscious and cognizant of his surroundings, and Putin didn't let Gerasimov out of his bunker, I believe they can complete the firing sequence. Do I think the oligarchs can or would stop him? One would hope, but as I've stated in the past, in this regard hope is an unreliable ally for the enemy we now face. Abramovich was poisoned recently, they had 2(?) oligarchs recently murder-suicide themselves and their families, and god knows how much we're just not hearing in the West. 

Russians have an embedded sense of suffering and struggle in their cultural heritage and I think they've deluded themselves to believe they can survive anything. This is even more sickeningly attested to by recent Russian state TV pundits discussing the usage of nukes and their general ideology that 'a world without Russia in it isn't worth having'. 

So do we just hope that the oligarchs haven't drank the kool-aid too, as they seem to enjoy vacationing in places that now blacklist and prohibit them and their families?

>EU companies may be able to purchase Russian gas in rubles without violating sanctions, the EU Commission says
From CNN's Amy Cassidy in London

>European companies may be able to purchase Russian gas in rubles without violating the European Union's sanctions against Moscow, according to new advice issued by the European Commission on Friday. 

>The advice issued states how a process involving the Russian Central Bank would be a breach of sanctions and how **continued payment in Euros/Dollars would be possible.**

>In a document issued to the member states and published online Thursday, the Commission states it ""appears possible"" that Moscow's decree demanding energy payments be made in Russian currency ""does not preclude a payment process which is in line with the EU restrictive measures."" 

>However, the commission notes the procedure is not yet clear. 

>A Russian decree issued in late March demands companies hold accounts in Russia's state-owned Gazprombank, which would **convert payments for gas into rubles**, in order to fulfill contracts, instead of trading directly with state gas giant Gazprom. The decree only applies to **existing contracts.**

>""EU companies can ask their Russian counterparts to fulfill their contractual obligations in the same manner as before the adoption of the Decree, i.e., by depositing **the due amount in Euros or Dollars**,"" the EU's guidance states.
Gazprombank has been sanctioned by the UK and the US, but not the EU.

>However, the Russian Central Bank, which is sanctioned by the EU, could be involved in Gazprombank's currency conversion, the commission notes. 

>**""Agreed contracts must be respected,""** a spokesperson from the EU Commission told CNN Friday, adding that **""97% of the relevant contracts explicitly stipulate payment in euros or dollars.** Companies with such contracts should not accede to Russian demands.""

>""We have carefully analyzed the new decree, and we are in contact with Member State authorities and with energy companies that would be affected. The EU will continue to respond in a united manner to this latest attempt by Russia to circumvent our sanctions,"" the spokesperson continued.",1651058170.0,1651057988.0,t3_ucurq6,t1_i6dw0m3,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

 >Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force.

 >Defence in depth (also known as deep defence or elastic defence) is a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker, buying time and causing additional casualties by yielding space. Rather than defeating an attacker with a single, strong defensive line, defence in depth relies on the tendency of an attack to lose momentum over time or as it covers a larger area. A defender can thus yield lightly defended territory in an effort to stress an attacker's logistics or spread out a numerically superior attacking force.

Taxpayers fund all sorts of research into all sorts of technologies--this is good, because a lot of innovation is _not_ commercially viable. If the only research done had to return a profit either no research would be done or the only research would be on ways to turn a greater profit. NASA, most of the research grants at universities, DARPA, etc. All government funded, all have made groundbreaking discoveries that have revolutionized our daily lives, mostly due to the additional work done by companies who saw a way to make the tech work at scale.

So, yes, phased array tech, developed by and used by the US military for years, in limited applications, at the taxpayers' expense. Licensed to SpaceX. Not stolen. Whose engineers figured out how to build orders of magnitude more phased array antennas than the military had _ever_ built and drastically reduce their cost. Enabling new technological capabilities (Starlink) that did not previously exist.

Two months later, the lesson is clear: Without air superiority, neither side can effectively attack and swamp the other.

Reports of the front line fighting from the tried-and-true analysis sources (Jomini of the West on Twitter, Institute for Study of War, MilitaryLand.com, and the Ukraine War daily updater account on YouTube) all appear to support the notion that Russian tactics have changed. They're advancing more carefully, with overlapping paths of advance so that multiple axes can support each other when they encounter resistance, and their rear lines are not as vulnerable to partisan attack or stretched as thin. The biggest change of all is that their lines of advance don't rely on single dirt roads 50+ kilometers long to sustain massive, 20+ BTG forces for weeks on end.

I also think it's becoming clear that Ukraine recognizes these new disadvantages and that they are attempting to adapt to them as best they can.

>However, the procedure for securing exemptions from the requirements of the decree is not yet clear, it said.

>**Before making payments, EU operators could also make a clear statement that they consider their contractual obligations to be completed when they deposit euros or dollars with Gazprombank - as opposed to later, after the payment is converted into roubles, the document said.**

>Hence, Putin’s announcement on 23 March can be viewed, from the perspective of trade between Russia and the West, as a proposed change to who bears the exchange-rate risk in the trading of gas. If the Russian rouble depreciates in the medium-to-longer run, it will become cheaper for the West to finance its imports from Russia. But if the opposite trend is observed, or in some way encouraged to prevail – and the logic behind Putin’s decision might have been exactly this – then the West bears the risk of paying more and more when buying the roubles to pay for its gas imports.   
   
The Gazprombank scheme, i.e. sticking to the original contract prices in the original currencies (""paying in euros"") and *then* converting the money to roubles, prevents this from becoming an issue.

That's just such cherry picking. The EU has strengths and weaknesses. Foreign policy is definitely the most difficult aspect of the EU, whereas financial, economic and legislative policies are its strong points. The UK traditionally also has been a country that has focused much more on it's military and interventionary capabilities than say the Italy or Germany. Additionally, about 90% of the actions and weapon deliveries the UK has done, could have been done while being part of the EU as well, there is no single EU foreign policy, you are implicitly perpetuating a Brexit fallacy.

Having said that, the EU response has decidedly not been a ""mess"", it has been uncharacteristically united on a hugely complicated topic and has delivered significant set backs to Russia. While certainly in delivery in arms countries like the UK and US can do a lot better, the brunt of the economic impact will be borne by the EU. 

This is simply the story of the far-right narrative all over again. Focus on a few visible and flashy points, let all relevant details and context vanish into a mist of complexity that is waved away by so called ""common sense"", aided by a good propaganda machine. Even your comment seems to reflect how good that works. The UK has had an enormous issue with Russian political influence, hell Brexit was significantly influenced by a Russian influence campaign and up until the war there was significant entanglement with the Tory party and the Russian oligarchy. {art of the reason by Johnson is responding so fiercely to this crisis is because it distracts form his significant domestic issues and own political position, leading to this particular poignant observation: https://www.private-eye.co.uk/pictures/covers/full/1571_big.jpg

Brexit has always been about having your cake and eating it too, mostly by playing up one side and playing down the other, pretending to have both. Your comment quite frankly perpetuates that fallacy. That's not to say the EU is perfect, nor that their response to the Ukraine crisis is perfect, but let's not pretend the response has been a ""mess"", nor that Brexit should be weighed by the UK response to this crisis alone - or that even UK's response to this crisis would have been markedly different while still being part of the EU.",1651068148.0,1651067636.0,t3_ucurq6,t1_i6e7xhi,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Its the ""surprise"" factor, of the occasional M777 smacking a 70km Excalibur shot to kill the enemy that makes the whole system so deadly.

MLRS systems can have a range as great as 300km. Rocket-artillery will always outrange gun-artillery due to fundamental physics. The most common MLRS systems only have 30km to 50km of range though.

Russia actually up until very recently has been leading the world when it comes to ballistic and rocket technology. Hold-over from the USSR-era. There's a reason why Russia plays such a significant part in space launches globally, for instance. So I don't doubt that they can be leading in this area.

Also, just because the US has the biggest budget, doesn't mean they can be leading in all area's. Specialization is a great way to spend less resources to achieve a better result in a smaller segment. The US has very different military aims and goals than Russia for instance. The US wants the strongest conventional army, navy and air force. They want force projection, long logistical supply chains, many worldwide bases etc. Russia knows they are can't challenge the US or China in a straight up fight, so their primary defense now comes from their nuclear deterrent. So finding ways to more effectively deliver nukes actually strengthens their position a lot, *especially* since the US and EU have been investing in missile defense.

So from that point of view, it also makes a lot of sense that Russia would be at the forefront of this technology.

Well, that's a horse of another colour, isn't it. Question is what are their reserves, and are they in the current situation even capable of creating more?

This, despite the troop build-up on Ukraine's border for months prior to the actual invasion. 

It's been really fascinating reading up, watching interviews, documentaries etc on how Russian military doctrine is structured and enacted. From what I've read/watched, and as always I'm completely open to being corrected and enlightened on what I might have missed/misinterpreted, but Russia really approaches this whole mess as ""Do what you're told by those in higher power than you"", even if they might personally disagree. It's really a fanatical sense of 'might is right', and speaks to the level of adherence you see from ground troops committing these horrors we see brought to light, followed up by reports of dissent, recordings of phone calls (some) lamenting what they're doing, and a general break in the ""unified front"" Russia is trying to put up before the world.

These things then lead into the notion of nuclear war in the sense that can we really hope those in the firing command for nuclear missiles will do the right thing? For a fact, Russians have famously in the past refrained in certain incidents throughout the Cold War, but it's a whole different world these days, and fear is something Russia is reliant on in terms of weaponization, both in house and around the world. Hope alone is then by my understanding of what currently is, an unreliable weapon for the enemy the world now faces.

Again, I hope I'm wrong and we never have to cross this bridge. But sadly, the fact alone we have these weapons lends to the thought that if not today, someone will be crazy enough to do it. The question is does anyone really have any idea of Putin's mindset and outlook, especially given how isolated and paranoid he is and increasingly becomes with the embarrassment of how Russians continue to perform.

These are career officers who can no longer climb the career ladder, NVM the scandal, essentially it’s pointless and burdensome on the Canada military to keep them around. 

An example of “sexual misconduct”, one of the generals who also had a case reopened for the same misconduct charge was that he had a sexual relationship with a subordinate female officer, and the relationship resulted in two children. Obviously the military frowns on this sort of thing, hence why it actually is misconduct, but you seem to not fully understand what’s going on here. 

Also, of the group of high ranking officers being re-investigated, there are more severe charges than sexual misconduct, one Vice Admiral is being charged/investigated for Sexual Assault. Point being they aren’t lumping varying degrees of allegations under one umbrella term or charge.

That's because the Gazprombank scheme was introduced later as a way for Russia to save face when the EU told them that changing the contract currency would be a breach of contract and require full renegotiation.    
   
 It's actually ""paying in euros"", not ""paying in roubles"". People keep mistakenly calling it that, but it isn't.  The EU is not allowed to control where those euros go once they leave their hands. The Gazprombank scheme is almost exactly equivalent to importers paying in euros and the Kremlin requiring Gazprombank to exchange those euros for rubles, with the exception of importers having to open a new ruble account (but not take on the forex risk) in the Gazprombank scheme.
