""Even if that happens, the consequences for Ukraine are difficult to predict,"" Rudik told NBC News. ""Let’s make it clear: There’s no good guys there. It is a group of Russians who did not agree with another group of Russians on the best way to kill us, Ukrainians. So, we are watching and cheering for both sides.""

Putin brought Prigozhin in as part of his divide and conquer strategy to deliberately create infighting within the military. PMCs are illegal but Putin specifically exempted Wagner from prosecution. Criticism of the military is illegal but Putin blocked prosecution because he liked being able to use Prigozhin as a mouthpiece to criticize commanders while keeping his own hands clean. Losses in the military are unpopular but Putin used Wagner to lose men off the books. The military establishment always hated Wagner because Wagner existed only to undercut them and their influence. They’ve wanted to cull them forever but Putin refused to let them because he felt it would give them too much influence and he wanted a counterbalance.

Putin specifically invited the wolf to the fireside and he specifically overruled everyone else who said it was a bad idea. He insisted that he could place a leash on the wolf and planned to use the wolf to intimidate his rivals.

The first group passed through the Novoshakhtinsk checkpoint in the Rostov region around midnight, reached the M-4 highway, and by morning reached Rostov-on-Don, where the headquarters of the Southern Military District is located. It is known that Yevgeny Prigozhin was in this group of PMC fighters - in Rostov he met with Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-Bek Yevkurov and General Alekseev.

The second group crossed the border about 120 km north of the first at the Voloshino checkpoint. From there, the mercenaries reached the city of Millerovo and turned onto the M-4 highway in order to move from there in the direction of Moscow. According to the interlocutors of Nestka, PMC Wagner bypassed Voronezh along the highway and headed further north, clashing with units of the Ministry of Defense along the way. According to the latest data, the mercenaries have already reached the north of the Lipetsk region - they were seen near the city of Yelets. This means that they have already covered more than half the way to Moscow.”

In the morning, two columns from the Wagner PMC were formed. The first, under the leadership of Prigozhin, went in and took full control of Rostov-on-Don. This was done in order to turn the attention of the media and security forces away from the main operation.

The second column, under the command of Dmitry Utkin, advanced towards Moscow and is now less than 100 km from the capital, in the suburbs of Moscow.

In order to stop the columns, the Russian Armed Forces used aviation, but 1 plane and 4 helicopters were shot down by the PMCs.

According to our information, a huge number of Wagners are already in Moscow, having got there under the guise of civilians.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-24-23/index.html

""United States and Western officials are being careful not to weigh in on the events unfolding in Russia because of how Russian President Vladimir Putin could weaponize any perceived involvement by the West in the escalating crisis, sources familiar with US President Joe Biden administration’s thinking told CNN.

Officials across the administration convened emergency meetings on Friday night to assess the events, which unfolded so quickly that they caught US and European officials off guard, the sources said. 

While tensions have been steadily rising over the last few months between Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin and Russia’s Ministry of Defense, US and European intelligence officials did not predict that Prigozhin would move to storm the Rostov region with his forces, sources familiar with the intelligence told CNN.

“It’s so hard to tell how much was talk and how much was real,” said one of the sources. “The tension had been building for so long without anything actually happening.”

A European intelligence official told CNN that the “temperature had obviously been building,” but few could have predicted what Prigozhin was planning.

The official said the West will be watching how this plays out over the next 24 to 48 hours, after which supply shortages will likely start kicking in for Wagner forces.

It is not clear to US or European officials how far in advance Prigozhin was planning the attack.

One source familiar with Western intelligence said it appeared that it must have taken at least several days to organize; another source, however, noted that Rostov is very close to the front lines in Ukraine, so it may not have required much forethought.""",False,1687620139.0,t3_14hu3pb,t3_14hu3pb,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

>So, the strategic idea of Prigozhin's team is extremely clear, logical, very risky, but it strikes with courage and has a chance of success in an atmosphere of sluggishness and demotivation of all power structures of the Russian Federation. Having gained a foothold in Rostov and diverting attention to themselves, they sharply throw the most combat-ready shock units (several thousand bayonets) into a raid on Moscow. Their task - bypassing all major centers (Voronezh passed by, passing Lipetsk as well) and trying not to get involved in battles with local garrisons (even without blocking them) - to rush to Moscow and by all means reach it as soon as possible. Further - the calculation is made on the panic and flight of all senior officials and the seizure of power ""lying on the ground."" Further, Prigozhin will only have to take the turn of those eager to urgently swear to him ""suddenly seeing the light"" officials of all ranks and solemnly enter the Kremlin. ""And there - it will be seen"" (what will happen next with Russia, the criminal and the garcon, I'm sure, worries the least, for that he will certainly become the ""best in hell"" and go down in history as the first criminal who took the post of ruler of our unfortunate country ).  
>  
>This strategy has only two vulnerabilities: the possibility of a collision with relatively large units that are combat-ready and do not want to surrender (or remain neutral) before approaching Moscow, and - inevitable in this case, problems with supplying the strike force, which will fight in isolation for longer than a couple of days from the supply will not be able to. And then - inevitably defeat.  
>  
>And here the Wagner strategists again ""guessed"" the decision - to ""dig in"" part of the forces in Rostov and attract there the efforts of those who are still ready to fight (at least at the level of intentions) for the Kremlin.

>In general, there are twice as many ""service people"" in Moscow than in the entire ""Wagner"" and many times more than in its shock group.

""A munition that landed in the southwestern Russian city of Voronezh during what appears to have been a clash between Wagner units and Russian forces damaged a number of cars, according to state media.

The munition landed in a parking lot in a residential complex on the outskirts of Voronezh. It’s not clear whether it came from a Russian helicopter or Wagner fighters on the ground.

""I was sitting on the balcony, drinking coffee, I was looking — people were pointing at the sky, there was a helicopter. Then — bang, I looked out into the yard, everything was in white smoke,"" a resident said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. “I saw smoke from the the oil refinery, then I went to look at the car.""

The resident's car was damaged. Other residents said the glass in their apartments was shattered.

Earlier, RIA Novosti reported that a Russian military Mi-8 helicopter made a hard landing in the Voronezh region, and one person was injured.

RIA cited emergency services. It did not disclose whether the helicopter was one of those apparently involved in operations against Wagner forces on the outskirts of the city of Voronezh.

While the whole world is watching the rebellion of the head of Wagner PMC Yevgeny Prigozhin and the ""march of justice"" to Moscow, active hostilities continue at the front. And the most intense pressure falls on the Orekhovsky area.


• Ukrainian formations advanced 1.5 km
north of Rabotino, taking landings.
Reinforcements of special forces from among the 22nd detachment of the Special Forces and the 45th detachment of the Special Forces of the Airborne Forces were transferred to the site to help the infantry units, which, under pressure from the enemy, were forced to retreat.


In the event that the Russian troops succeed in regrouping and seizing the initiative, it is possible to close the advancing enemy groups into a ""cauldron"" north of Rabotino - at least the RF Armed Forces have enough forces and means in the area.


• According to the Archangel of the Spetsnaz, a concentration of enemy infantry was detected near Nesteryanka: after a successful fire defeat, the Ukrainian formations were dispersed.

• Five Hats are still partly in the gray zone, partly under the control of the enemy. There is no confident control of the RF Armed Forces over the settlement, the Russian infantry is working on enemy reinforcements trying to move forward.
In general, there are too many problems in the Zaporozhye direction, so the fighters, to put it mildly, do not pay much attention to the rebellious marches in the rear.”

**The threat to place Wagner troops under MoD command and on contract is a threat to change their pay and conditions. Which may well motivate folk.**  
Basically we have a formed unit in a rear area decides that's it and at 2 AM Moscow time moved into Rostov, which is a rear area HQ with practically no defences. Then went on a road trip 750 ish miles to Moscow. Its about 12-14 hours drive apparently up the M4 from Rostov to Moscow.  
**Unsurprisingly the local police forces feel unable to deal with a large armed convoy of white vans and tanks on low loaders with no visible bridging kit, so a ditch in the road is a viable obstacle until you fill it in. Whether its possible to assemble any sort of force in the time available is moot but more delay = more time and blowing a major river bridge is a LOT more time,**  
So its quite possible Wagner gets to Moscow today or tomorrow. OFC that means an immediate reserve for the War is now in Moscow. And the main HQ for directing the war is now not reporting to Moscow, and the sub units may not accept orders from anyone else or from that HQ. Another reserve being the Chechens now advancing on Rostov.  
**Great so what happens next. You got up to 25k battle hardened mercenaries, rapists, murderers and diverse crooks all with guns and possibly some level of PTSD let loose on the fleshpots of Moscow, filled as it is with draft dodgers, effete oligarchs luxury flats and luxury women, what could possibly go wrong.**  
If the government is not there, or if the organs of state power throughout the land do not immediately fall into line behind the hammer wielding possibly mutinous mercenary commander what does he do?  
**I have heard that up to 25% of the Russian Army ( I would read rifle strength) is Wagner I would assume some other troops would cleave to him and others to the Putin but I would expect most to hold position for a while, taking sides is dangerous and how can you argue with a man who held the line against the UA.**

He should continue up the M-4 until he gets to the A-113... ok here's where it gets crazy, i'm going to go against Napolean here...

At the A-113 he should split his army.  Not in half, but into 2 units.  Yes it's very risky, but the 2nd smaller group should proceed over the A-113 to the M-2 and from the M-2 continue north to Moscow.

This gives Pringles a flanking force while still being able to support each other over (relatively) close ground.  If somehow the Russian's have enough troops to pull a ""300"" and block them at the M-4, the flanking force could either move in from the M-2 to support OR continue around the barricade.

The reason i think this is the best attack for Wagner is because Russia can't possibly defend 2 spots with what they have and coordinate that defense.  The confusion it would cost, in my expert military opinion, would be worth the risk of splitting the force.

It's an all or nothing gambit and I for one believe it would be a daring and heroic move.

Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that Charles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;[*] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.

I wonder how long it would take and what they would say to their troops about what is going on.  I highly doubt they've been told whats going on and or have access to information like the rest of the world does.

If you told your invading army ""Hey we have to get back to the capital because our ally is about to take it over"", that just must be a massive hit to morale.  I'm not sure you can come back from that.

Crazy insane hot take - The war in Ukraine is unoffically over and Russian troops will fall back to lines from 2014 in the next couple of weeks.

This coup is a catastrophe, but remains unlikely to succeed unless more people in high places announce their shifting allegiance. If the U.S. attempted to oust Putin under such flimsy cover and with unclear possible gains, it would risk substantial retaliatory strikes once power was reconstituted. That could lead to escalation and war without much massaging. Too much risk. Too little gain. 

But, that narrative does serve the Russian state because obviously no Russian would oppose the dear leader unless western masters were pulling the strings. I don’t know that this is going to be the narrative Putin goes for - but I see no reason for people on Reddit to help pave the road for such a narrative based on speculation.

Let's not forget that even with a complete assault from multiple sides, Russia wasn't even close to conquering Kyiv, which 'only' houses a bit under 3 millions inhabitants.

However, it'll still depend on the fervor of Putin's loyalists. If they back him 100%, there is 0 chance for Wagner to even come close to inflicting real damage to the capital.

And I think that the moment Wagner sees they've reached an impasse, they'll pull back and start to consolidate their gains instead of risking it all on a move that has realistically no chance of success.",False,1687625591.0,t3_14hu3pb,t3_14hu3pb,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

It's at an angled view that would put the cam on the southwest side of the building's surrounding area. We also have a view of the Radisson Collection Hotel in Moscow which is on the right side of the river almost directly actually across the Russian White House. The camera is overhead the continuation of Novoarbatsky bridge that crosses the river but on the right-side of it (hotel side). The double towered buildings adjoined to each other is on New Arbat Street 36, Russia; that building belongs to Moscow's government.

The WaPo captures both the Moscow govt. building, the Radisson Collection hotel in Moscow, and the Russian White House in one angle. On top of that, we can just see the Kudrinskaya Square building (the pointy thing, not the flag post, past the Russian White House).

We can also just see the patio of the Radisson Collection Hotel's patio in the view. We also see two large yellow/white street signs followed by a smaller one along with a sidewalk and trees in view.

I'm thinking it's a (maybe wide angled) overhead camera on Kutuzovsky Avenue opposite the Hotel so on the right side of the river

Most of Russia's serious air power is air superiority fighters and strategic bombers. Neither are particularly useful against convoys. They've burned through a lot of their standoff guided missiles already in Ukraine. Their defense plan mostly rests on other nations not attacking them by not getting nuked, and that's what their air force is ideal for. A bomber run with fighter cover.

What they would use against this attack are helicopters and ground attack jets. Mi-24 Hinds, Su-25 Frogfoots, etc. They've already had several shot down because Wagner has mobile Pantsir AA systems, i.e. the best system Russia has (and one of the things Russia builds that is genuinely and unquestionably world class).

Wagner has also been a training provider for Russian pilots who don't necessarily want to be unloading on their buddies.

""Well, they need them for the Ukranian invasion!"". Really? Don't you think it's more important that they defend the Russian capital from a coup?

""They don't have many jets left"". I don't think that is true. I am sure that they have enough to, again, protect the capital from a coup.

So I would say that the reason probably is a mix of the following:

- Wagner can successfully shoot down jets and helicopters, as they have already done several times today. Maybe Russia is being careful with their jets and helicopters, and instead they are planning a bigger defense.

- Trust issues and change of command. Maybe some air force people have decided to join Wagner or simply not fight at all, or maybe people higher up are worried about the coup and are blocking access to the jets in case the pilots turn against the regime.

The Afghanistan gov't fled, and Afghanistan didnt have a disciplined or well trained army that was willing to fight so the Taliban barely faced any resistance. 

Wagner has a good path, the European parts of Russia are pretty flat and easy to drive over. Russia does have a trained and armed domestic military force (FSB) but reportedly in Rostov many were sympathetic to Wagner and either refused to fight or changed sides. And some are saying Putin has fled Moscow, and potentially Russia, (but who knows) and that could hurt morale to any other FSB. 

I think the key factor in how long it will take is if along Wagners path to Moscow they face any significant pushback. FSB are entrenching themselves on the giant ring road that surrounds Moscow. Kadyrov also sent his PMC to counter Wagner, but its unclear if any fighting has actually taken place between them.

Wagner hitting Moscow is probably not the end to this though, even if Prigozhin sits at the top of the Kremlin, there are a lot of factions within the Russian oligarchy who are very prepared to use their power and influence to not allow massive changes to the status quo.",False,1687620540.0,t3_14hu3pb,t1_jpcuh5r,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Mussolini was essentially supported by the majority of the ""capitani d'industria"" (High level capitalists) and the governement itself allowed the situation to happen.

The head of the Wagner mercenary group, which is basically an independent branch of the Russian military, has been openly outspoken on the failures of Russia during the war.

Recently a missile was either purposely fired at the backlines of the Wagner mercs. No one knows if it was intentional, accidental, or staged.

The leader of the mercenary group took this as a personal attack against him and his forces. There are unsubstantiated rumors that it may have even been an attempted assassination against the leader of the warner mercs.

When asked about why that missile attack hit the mercenaries, Russia government did not give a sufficient response.

Russia's minister of defense, the guy who's been basically running the war, fled the town he was in back to Moscow supposedly. 

The Wagner mercenaries took over the town of a million people that the minister of defense was in, including easily storming his former headquarters and aiming tanks at it.

Supposedly as I went to sleep last night, Wagner mercs had supposedly shot down two Russian helicopters and were advancing on Moscow.

The only way to disarm a country like a Russia is from within, direct confrontation from NATO would likely provoke some form of nuclear exchange. This isn't exactly what the West has been hoping for, but close to it.

I don't think anyone can reliably predict what Prigozhin would do once he is in power, but my bet would be that he would be taking steps to consolidate his new position. I don't believe that would involve nuclear war, or selling Russian nuclear material to extremists. If Prigozhin takes the seat, I think entities like NATO or China would be doing a lot of negotiating in order to wheel him in as someone they can work with on global affairs. 

You can't put a lot of stock into what Prigozhin has said previously in public forums. He needs to create his own strongman image to be seen as a leadership alternative in Russia. If morale is low in the Russian military, which appears to be the case, Prigozhin could make a very popular move by ending the war and creating a buffer zone. The ""march to justice"" itself could be used as a palatable reason to why the war in Ukraine can't continue, normally that defeat would smear his new image but he still comes out on top with a defeat over Putin.

His rhetoric has always been a beef with heads of the MoD, not the civilian leadership.  He can't change that narrative or there is a real risk ""Russia"" balkanizes.  

As for access to nukes, the MoD probably only has loyalists in those positions.  Remember while Shoigu is a political appointee (he came up through the Russian equivalent of the US' Homeland Defense), Gerasimov led men in the Second Chechen War.  And after the disastrous infighting between conventional army and the rocket forces over funding (which led to the dismissal of Yuri Baluyevsky), it was seen that Putin reallocated funds back to the Rocket Forces under the advice of Gerasimov.

Is any of this going to prevent a nuke being dropped on Kyiv?  Who knows.  But this could cause a situation where the Russian MoD starts talking about using one on Wagner.  Actually doing it would be suicide for the Putin regime, but if Wagner picks up supporters and continues to get closer to Moscow without resistance, who knows.",False,1687623098.0,t3_14hu3pb,t1_jpcybw1,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
