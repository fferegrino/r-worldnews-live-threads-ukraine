1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,14xddvu,jrqi5t1,"The Popov story has been talked about in independent Russian channels the last week.

For example, previously, a channel that reports on Russian corruption posted that Popov has tried to mimic Teplinsky’s method and submitted a report to Gerasimov. In it, he addressed a need to rotate units that have been on the line of combat for an extensive period and the causes of significant losses on certain units.

Then yesterday, they posted that as a result, “Gerasimov accused Popov of alarmism and blackmailing top management...and sent him to the front in retaliation.” 

 (here: https://t\.me/vchkogpu/39871) 

That channel now crows about their accuracy, though not all parts of their report seem to have been verified.

Edit:  I see the IS W picked up on @vchkogpu ‘s version, repeating that removed by Gerasimov, caller an alarmist, etc.",1689214763.0,1689204240.0,t3_14xddvu,t3_14xddvu,,0,28,0,28,0,0,
1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,14xddvu,jrr70wn,"
The independent Russian investigative publication *The Insider* is reporting that Popov references treachery because the strike on Berdyansk yesterday at the Dune Hotel which killed the other General was actually meant for him, and imply that sent by Russian command..


*end of Popov’s statement:*

>> I also raised a number of other problems, pointing to the highest level—to be frank, I was extremely blunt. In that regard, apparently, the senior commanders sensed I presented some kind of danger and they quickly concocted an order from the Minister of Defense in one day; it removed me from my location and basically got rid of me. As many commanders of the regiments of the division said today—even though the Armed Forces of Ukraine could not break through our [RF] army from the front, our senior commander hit us from the rear, treacherously and vilely decapitating the [RF] army at the most difficult and tense time.

*The Insider adds:*

> The day before, on July 11, a missile attacked Hotel Dune in the Berdyansk, where the ‘command headquarters of the Russian 58th Army’ was supposed to be located [so supposed to be Popov], but the attack instead killed Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov. A number of Tg channels reported that Tsokov died by accident, that Major General Ivan Popov was supposed to be the “real” target; so, apparently, *this* is how Russiam command gets rid of unwanted people. Tsokov, on the other hand, was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time.""





Note, that the source which reports on Russian corruption, the @vchkogpu channel, which is cited by IS W, reported 48hrs ago that Popov has already been sent “to the front in retaliation.”  So, its indeed possible that a strike “of retaliation” was meant for him.

People who are calling him whiney all have one thing in common: they aren't the leader of a nation that has been invaded by an imperialist power.  It would be malpractice for him not to push for NATO membership.  It's not as if Ukraine doesn't have a case.  They are the bulwark against further Russian expansionism and are paying with their blood.  I totally get it.

As an American, I also understand why we can't just give them full membership while the conflict is still ongoing.  While I don't believe America would be under any real threat if we fully intervened, besides the obvious nuclear saber rattling that Russia has done, we have obligations to our existing allies in the region.  I doubt the Baltic states, Poland or other border countries would welcome open conflict with Russia.  Most of the point of NATO and indeed collective defense is to prevent open conflict between NATO states and Russia.

I'm 100% for more support from NATO to Ukraine.  I think when Ukraine wins, they should have their membership to NATO expedited to prevent any further Russian aggression.  I believe that Ukraine's immense experience in open conflict with Russia will be indispensable to NATO, and that at least the United States and Ukraine will remain strong allies for years to come.

> The United States + just 6 of the many European artillery ammo makers will ramp up to over 2.5 million 155mm arty rounds per year.

BY WHEN? I wonder. The thread contains few specifics about immediately increases that can help Ukraine *real soon now*. The US is going to get to 90,000 rounds of 155mm per month *within two years*. The longest ramp-up horizon is a company planning to hit a production goal by 2028.

Do you think Ukraine will still be fighting this war in two years? Will it take that long to drive Russia out?

I wonder if these announced plans may convince Russia that it cannot win a protracted war, and should get out now, since AFAIK it cannot possibly match the West's increase in artillery ammunition production.

Edit: For context, a November 2022 NBC News story says:

> Russia and Ukraine are burning through artillery shells and other weapons and ammunition at a rate not seen since the Korean War, officials said, and will need to restock during the long winter to come.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/live-blog/biden-zelenskyy-nato-ukraine-russia-live-updates-rcna93801

""VILNIUS, Lithuania — President Joe Biden’s national security adviser told a Ukrainian activist frustrated that Ukraine wasn’t invited into NATO that the American people deserve “a degree of gratitude” for stepping up to support the country as it battles Russian forces.

In a tense exchange during a public forum on the sideline’s summit, Jake Sullivan was questioned by Daria Kaleniuk, a prominent activist from the Kyiv-based group Anti-Corruption Action Centre. Kaleniuk argued that Ukraine had waited patiently for an invitation for years and asked what specific conditions still must be met.

“What should I tell my son? That President Biden and NATO didn’t invite Ukraine to NATO because he’s afraid of Russia, afraid of Russia losing, afraid of Ukraine winning?” Kaleniuk said. “Should I prepare my son to be a soldier and fight Russians, when he will be 18 years in seven years?”

Sullivan, while praising Kaleniuk for her group’s work, said her insinuations about U.S. motives were “entirely unfounded and unjustified.” He said Biden had made clear he’s not prepared for Ukraine into NATO now because “it would mean that the United States and NATO would be at war with Russia now.”

“The American people have sought in watching and wanting to stand in solidarity with the brave and courageous people of Ukraine, to step up and deliver,” Sullivan replied. “And I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude, from us, from the United States, from our government, deserve gratitude for their willingness to step up and from the rest of the world as well, as do every ally and partner that’s supporting it.”""",False,1689167841.0,t3_14xddvu,t3_14xddvu,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

NATO will likely continue to arm Ukraine even after Ukraine has driven out Russia.  Ukraine is defacto NATO, and if they have all of NATO's weapons they don't need article 5 protection, at least against a collapsed & weakened Russia.  Yes, article 5 is a strong deterrent but also a strong deterrent would be Ukraine's ability to destroy every Russian base within 250km of the border on a whim.  Think of it like Israel, Israel doesn't have to be in NATO because they can annihilate any of their belligerent neighbors that looks at them the wrong way any time they want, without resorting to nukes.

I agree with this.

They are doing the fighting and dying, and frankly the hesitant, timid and reluctant way the west has helped, always with one eye on the (totally ridiculous, obviously far fetched) prospect of russian retaliation has, in retrospect been absolutely shameful. 

None of the excuses for not providing full fledged help  from the outset stack up at all, they were all nonsense, and to see the same excuses used to slowroll every other imaginable type of military aid now trotted out with absolute sincerity in relation to ATACMS is just wow.

NATO does not want a kinetic conflict with Russia, that's fine.

As such, they might as well act as if they were in war, in industrial terms. Continue to increase the military production levels to war mode, and funnel everything other than the base minimum to Ukraine. There is no other country right now threatening war with the West, except maybe China, and that would be more of a maritime-air conflict with the US rather than the kind of ugly brawl happening in Ukraine.

I think this has less to do with an entire country being flawed, and more to do with a company which happens to be located in Belgium seeing an opportunity to earn some money. 

By that logic I could just as easily claim that Heineken’s sanction dodging can be fully explained because of the Netherlands’ historical human rights record. Like the time the VOC exterminated the population of an entire island to turn it into a plantation colony … over four hundred years ago. And yet literally nobody does that. Everyone understands that what Heineken is doing is flawed and against the law, and that they are doing it purely because of present-day profit motives. The actions of a single individual or company don’t speak for their respective country as a whole. The Dutch government still strongly supports Ukraine despite companies like Heineken subverting sanctions. Same goes for Belgium.

Generally,  every death where there is a will (no matter the wealth or ethnicity of the deceased) will end up in this registry, or it even could be the case that they end up in the registry, in the absence of a legal will, since every death should result in a legal inheritance. I honestly don't know.

Personally, I think it's irrelevant, but to speculate further.

One could argue, that wealthy people are generally more likely to have a will than poor people, but then again people who are in the military, and leave for an invasion are also more likely to have a will, than the average person in the population, people tend to make them when mobilized.

Within Ukraine, I think it is probably right now very common to portray the country has an heroic actor that is defending the high ideals of democracy and freedom. The risk here is that leads to a bit of an echo-chamber effect where the reality you experience is not aligned with the reality others are experiencing. NATO countries will look at the situation more dispassionate and from a more realpolitik point of view, whereas Zelensky and his team likely are looking at it more passionately and some type of manifest destiny point of view. 

What we saw in Vilnius, is those two viewpoints clashing. Frankly, post war I can even see some tensions arising out of this. Under the right conditions, a nationalistic movement could be born in Ukraine that points to heroic war they fought and seeks to cast Ukrainians as inherently better than other nationalities, claim as much responsibility for the positive outcome of the war and diminish the help of NATO. An obvious narrative from such a nationalistic element would be: ""NATO didn't help us enough, if they had done more, this could have been avoided, or at least many less of our country would have died"".

I'm suggesting to people (like you) who are so stridently confident that you know what happened that you do not know what happened because you are not privy to the information.

That, is not being objective.  It's being myopically dedicated to your preferred conclusion.",False,1689194336.0,t3_14xddvu,t1_jrptg9d,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

This is not a serious method of reasoning. Your argument is the equivalent of ""I have a girlfriend, but she goes to another school"". It's an untestable assertion of fact, or rather in your argument a general reference to the intrinsic unknowable state of things. 

Additionally you are conflating the secrets of the war with insider knowledge in politics. Zelensky will have both, but insider knowledge in politics are generally speaking much more visible to the public as they get reported on frequently. 

For this exact reason we know of two specific instances were both the UK and the US have (then, in private) rebuked the Ukrainian attitude regarding weapon deliveries. First was Biden [losing his temper](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-lost-temper-zelenskyy-phone-call-ukraine-aid-rcna54592) in a call with Zelensky, and the second we learned today from Ben Wallace was that [both lawmakers in the US and the UK](https://www.forces.net/ukraine/were-not-amazon-wallace-tells-ukrainian-president-keep-uk-and-other-allies-side) have expressed unease with the perceived lack of gratitude from Ukraine last June.

Fact is, it's been a bit of a running theme in the relationship between Ukraine and NATO. Of course there is a push and pull, but it's clear that the fervor with which Ukraine has pushed for aid has lead to frictions before, as it did during this summit. 

My assertion builds on this. Your assertion ignores this. Frankly, you are grasping at straws, positing some type of philosophical argument when in actuality: when it talks like a duck and quacks like a duck, *it's probably a duck*.",False,1689195277.0,t3_14xddvu,t1_jrpu5y4,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Again, a reference to the general unknowability of things is not a real argument on itself. At best, it's a qualification to an analysis. If your point is that we should be careful in our structuring our opinions then that is fine, but that is not how you presented it initially. 

Frankly, I feel that with this statement your backtracking on your initial point (paraphrased: Zelensky is right, the commentators are wrong) to retroactively make it seem like it had a semblance of legitimacy.
