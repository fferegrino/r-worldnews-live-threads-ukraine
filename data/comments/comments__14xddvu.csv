1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,14xddvu,jrqi5t1,"The Popov story has been talked about in independent Russian channels the last week.

For example, previously, a channel that reports on Russian corruption posted that Popov has tried to mimic Teplinsky‚Äôs method and submitted a report to Gerasimov. In it, he addressed a need to rotate units that have been on the line of combat for an extensive period and the causes of significant losses on certain units.

Then yesterday, they posted that as a result, ‚ÄúGerasimov accused Popov of alarmism and blackmailing top management...and sent him to the front in retaliation.‚Äù 

 (here: https://t\.me/vchkogpu/39871) 

That channel now crows about their accuracy, though not all parts of their report seem to have been verified.

Edit:  I see the IS W picked up on @vchkogpu ‚Äòs version, repeating that removed by Gerasimov, caller an alarmist, etc.",1689214763.0,1689204240.0,t3_14xddvu,t3_14xddvu,,0,28,0,28,0,0,
1a9569ec51866e046f8847c38d341e1f,14xddvu,jrr70wn,"
The independent Russian investigative publication *The Insider* is reporting that Popov references treachery because the strike on Berdyansk yesterday at the Dune Hotel which killed the other General was actually meant for him, and imply that sent by Russian command..


*end of Popov‚Äôs statement:*

>> I also raised a number of other problems, pointing to the highest level‚Äîto be frank, I was extremely blunt. In that regard, apparently, the senior commanders sensed I presented some kind of danger and they quickly concocted an order from the Minister of Defense in one day; it removed me from my location and basically got rid of me. As many commanders of the regiments of the division said today‚Äîeven though the Armed Forces of Ukraine could not break through our [RF] army from the front, our senior commander hit us from the rear, treacherously and vilely decapitating the [RF] army at the most difficult and tense time.

*The Insider adds:*

> The day before, on July 11, a missile attacked Hotel Dune in the Berdyansk, where the ‚Äòcommand headquarters of the Russian 58th Army‚Äô was supposed to be located [so supposed to be Popov], but the attack instead killed Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov. A number of Tg channels reported that Tsokov died by accident, that Major General Ivan Popov was supposed to be the ‚Äúreal‚Äù target; so, apparently, *this* is how Russiam command gets rid of unwanted people. Tsokov, on the other hand, was ""in the wrong place at the wrong time.""





Note, that the source which reports on Russian corruption, the @vchkogpu channel, which is cited by IS W, reported 48hrs ago that Popov has already been sent ‚Äúto the front in retaliation.‚Äù  So, its indeed possible that a strike ‚Äúof retaliation‚Äù was meant for him.

They are the bulwark against further Russian expansionism and are paying with their blood.  I totally get it.

As an American, I also understand why we can't just give them full membership while the conflict is still ongoing.  While I don't believe America would be under any real threat if we fully intervened, besides the obvious nuclear saber rattling that Russia has done, we have obligations to our existing allies in the region.  I doubt the Baltic states, Poland or other border countries would welcome open conflict with Russia.  Most of the point of NATO and indeed collective defense is to prevent open conflict between NATO states and Russia.

I'm 100% for more support from NATO to Ukraine.  I think when Ukraine wins, they should have their membership to NATO expedited to prevent any further Russian aggression.  I believe that Ukraine's immense experience in open conflict with Russia will be indispensable to NATO, and that at least the United States and Ukraine will remain strong allies for years to come.

> The United States + just 6 of the many European artillery ammo makers will ramp up to over 2.5 million 155mm arty rounds per year.

BY WHEN? I wonder. The thread contains few specifics about immediately increases that can help Ukraine *real soon now*. The US is going to get to 90,000 rounds of 155mm per month *within two years*. The longest ramp-up horizon is a company planning to hit a production goal by 2028.

Do you think Ukraine will still be fighting this war in two years? Will it take that long to drive Russia out?

I wonder if these announced plans may convince Russia that it cannot win a protracted war, and should get out now, since AFAIK it cannot possibly match the West's increase in artillery ammunition production.

Edit: For context, a November 2022 NBC News story says:

> Russia and Ukraine are burning through artillery shells and other weapons and ammunition at a rate not seen since the Korean War, officials said, and will need to restock during the long winter to come.

It is clear that there is no coming back to Russia for Ukraine. There are no friendly ties left to speak of between the two countries. Both countries are at full on 100% hostility right now. Yes, there are family ties in between the two countries, but that's not saying much at this point. Those must be in shambles.

With Sweden entering NATO, and further supplies of weapons continuing, and removing one step of the NATO admission process for Ukraine; things are moving in the good direction, although not quickly enough for Ukraine, which is understandable.

Putin is probably counting on far-right pro-Russia (or even far-left tankies) leaders getting elected in power over the years, such as in France, Germany or in the USA. Those could sabotage the unity and commitment of allied powers in assisting Ukraine win this war.",1689159673.0,1689159205.0,t3_14xddvu,t3_14xddvu,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

""VILNIUS, Lithuania ‚Äî President Joe Biden‚Äôs national security adviser told a Ukrainian activist frustrated that Ukraine wasn‚Äôt invited into NATO that the American people deserve ‚Äúa degree of gratitude‚Äù for stepping up to support the country as it battles Russian forces.

In a tense exchange during a public forum on the sideline‚Äôs summit, Jake Sullivan was questioned by Daria Kaleniuk, a prominent activist from the Kyiv-based group Anti-Corruption Action Centre. Kaleniuk argued that Ukraine had waited patiently for an invitation for years and asked what specific conditions still must be met.

Sullivan, while praising Kaleniuk for her group‚Äôs work, said her insinuations about U.S. motives were ‚Äúentirely unfounded and unjustified.‚Äù He said Biden had made clear he‚Äôs not prepared for Ukraine into NATO now because ‚Äúit would mean that the United States and NATO would be at war with Russia now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe American people have sought in watching and wanting to stand in solidarity with the brave and courageous people of Ukraine, to step up and deliver,‚Äù Sullivan replied. ‚ÄúAnd I think the American people do deserve a degree of gratitude, from us, from the United States, from our government, deserve gratitude for their willingness to step up and from the rest of the world as well, as do every ally and partner that‚Äôs supporting it.‚Äù""",False,1689167841.0,t3_14xddvu,t3_14xddvu,,0,7,0,7,0,0,

NATO does not want a kinetic conflict with Russia, that's fine.

They will never officially acknowledge it, but they should quietly understand that they are not just some neutral power handing out some arms, but are truly intervening in the war, by using Ukraine as a proxy on steroids against Russia - not minimizing Ukraine's own weight-pulling here, the fact this chance even exists at all is because they have proven formidable on their own.

As such, they might as well act as if they were in war, in industrial terms. Continue to increase the military production levels to war mode, and funnel everything other than the base minimum to Ukraine. There is no other country right now threatening war with the West, except maybe China, and that would be more of a maritime-air conflict with the US rather than the kind of ugly brawl happening in Ukraine.

Within Ukraine, I think it is probably right now very common to portray the country has an heroic actor that is defending the high ideals of democracy and freedom. The risk here is that leads to a bit of an echo-chamber effect where the reality you experience is not aligned with the reality others are experiencing. NATO countries will look at the situation more dispassionate and from a more realpolitik point of view, whereas Zelensky and his team likely are looking at it more passionately and some type of manifest destiny point of view. 

What we saw in Vilnius, is those two viewpoints clashing. Frankly, post war I can even see some tensions arising out of this. Under the right conditions, a nationalistic movement could be born in Ukraine that points to heroic war they fought and seeks to cast Ukrainians as inherently better than other nationalities, claim as much responsibility for the positive outcome of the war and diminish the help of NATO.

Yet the statement from yesterday failed to formulate that sole idea: it just say some day when all the allies will agree (let's say that was an euphemism for ""after the war"") and when the conditions are fullfilled they could join. What are those conditions? Again, might be an euphemism of ""a russian defeat"" but Stoltenberg couldn't say it in the press conference and later americans were talking about democratic reforms... So we don't know exactly what the conditions are. 

There's nothing on NATO statement making some compromise to help Ukraine to win. Not the usual ""as long as it takes"", to win. In fact, NATO members are delaying or denying essential weapons like long-range missiles. UK gave them Storm Shadows not as a part of NATO policy but their own. Germany again said yesterday Taurus is not on table.

This put Ukraine into a limbo. Since the end of the war was not explicited as the main ""condition"", it means NATO could delay the ukrainian membership with any other condition. Today is because the war is not ended, tomorrow could be because Ukraine is poor or corrupt.

""To send the existing weapons stock"" in this case means...

""To send a limited existing weapons stock being used at the Korean DMZ during a time of increased instability, and reducing the mission readiness of a whole branch of the US armed forces for the next 3-5 years when there are clearly better alternatives, both in the EU and US.""

There is plenty of political will now to send ATACMS, it's now more of a logistical issue of why it's a bad idea. If you're wanting to agitate around political will, I think the real target would be agitating to send a large supply of JASSM with those F-16, a much more powerful and game changing weapon that the US and allies like Australia can actually afford to part with, and whose possible availability is actually the question of political will you're talking about.",False,1689220848.0,t3_14xddvu,t1_jrr14fa,,8,2,0,2,0,0,

Occam's razor applies. 

Zelensky pushed too hard. He received a negative reaction. He altered his tone. That is what we all saw. Your argument of ""yes but actually there could be *secret information* that explains all of this in a way we can't ever understand"" is just magic handwaving that smacks of conspiracy thinking.

What do you mean by existential threat?  We all understand if not for nukes NATO already would be in Ukraine, was Soviet Union an existential threat?  Because the West never fought them directly, doesn't make it less existential.  Also i'm not talking about today, obviously today Russia is not strong enough to contest anything controlled by nato, but give it the chunk of influence and power  that USSR had and it will unavoidably try , not hard concept to understand that imperialistic countries which keep expanding with invasion constantly will keep doing that until stopped, it's either now or much later against a much larger foe.  But yeah, today Russia is not existential threat as was Nazis or Soviets, but only because it's weaker today, not because it's ideologically better.  

>Also, on a side note, regarding western intelligence - youre talking about the intelligence services that warned Zelensky about the incoming attack while he insisted that nothing would happen, right?

I don't care about Zelensky , but this was a dumb invasion ,clearly those forces weren't enough to take Ukraine and that's maybe one of the reasons why Zelensky believed it was a bluff, but I'm gonna give credit where credit is due about west warning Ukraine before the invasion, but West mispredicted the result of it, and it's not the first time Iraq or Afghan is the same story, and things like leaked counter-offensive plans doesn't add credibility to western intelligence .",False,1689164896.0,t3_14xddvu,t1_jrnht3l,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

This is not a serious method of reasoning. Your argument is the equivalent of ""I have a girlfriend, but she goes to another school"". It's an untestable assertion of fact, or rather in your argument a general reference to the intrinsic unknowable state of things. 

Additionally you are conflating the secrets of the war with insider knowledge in politics. Zelensky will have both, but insider knowledge in politics are generally speaking much more visible to the public as they get reported on frequently. 

For this exact reason we know of two specific instances were both the UK and the US have (then, in private) rebuked the Ukrainian attitude regarding weapon deliveries. First was Biden [losing his temper](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/biden-lost-temper-zelenskyy-phone-call-ukraine-aid-rcna54592) in a call with Zelensky, and the second we learned today from Ben Wallace was that [both lawmakers in the US and the UK](https://www.forces.net/ukraine/were-not-amazon-wallace-tells-ukrainian-president-keep-uk-and-other-allies-side) have expressed unease with the perceived lack of gratitude from Ukraine last June.

Fact is, it's been a bit of a running theme in the relationship between Ukraine and NATO. Of course there is a push and pull, but it's clear that the fervor with which Ukraine has pushed for aid has lead to frictions before, as it did during this summit.

Again, a reference to the general unknowability of things is not a real argument on itself. At best, it's a qualification to an analysis. If your point is that we should be careful in our structuring our opinions then that is fine, but that is not how you presented it initially. 

Frankly, I feel that with this statement your backtracking on your initial point (paraphrased: Zelensky is right, the commentators are wrong) to retroactively make it seem like it had a semblance of legitimacy.
