Arestovych talked about this, in the context of ""evil voices say"" but really with more information than we normally get from him. 

What's said is that the Russians had ""bad guys"" there who were shooting up Ochakiv  and conducting electronic warfare actions towards Mykolaiv/Odesa. Ochakiv is where some Ukrainian Navy Seals are based and the Russian bad guys are now disappeared (in the most ominous for them sense of the word). 

When asked who replaced the bad guys he said ""some cool guys"" and (paraphrase) ""now all of Mykolaiv part of which was there has been liberated"".

Day 265 of my updates from Kharkiv.

What a complete shit show of a day, we had no electricity, water or internet since 4:40pm and up until 12:40am. Not having internet is especially bad, it truly feels like being cut off from outside world, as we didn‚Äôt know when electricity would be fixed if it will be fixed at all. Thankfully it did get fixed; our electricians are truly heroic people.

When around 9pm we finally got some internet connection for a second, and then we read about Russian missiles hitting Poland and killing some people, it honestly felt like missing the start of WW3, as we had literally no news coming through for about 5 hours, we didn‚Äôt even know if the missile strikes are continuing.

There absolutely **needs** to be a serious reaction from NATO. If this goes unpunished, then expect nukes to start dropping in Ukraine as soon as next week, as NATO would be seen as completely toothless by Russia. If they are allowed to strike NATO countries and kill their citizens with no repercussions, then there will be no answer to nukes being used either. 

Don‚Äôt misunderstand, this strike on Poland is not a mistake by Russia, they are simply testing the waters and trying to see what they can get away with. You don‚Äôt miss your target by 30km+ and then land 7km inside Polish borders, especially not with a Kh-101, which is one of their new-ish cruise missiles with a CEP of 10-20 meters that they only started using in 2013. It being shot down by us and then landing in Poland is also bullshit, an intercepted missile doesn‚Äôt get flung for 10km+, it falls down at most within 1km of where it was shot down.

A quick refresh on NATO bylaws:

* Article 5: An attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all of its members.
* Article 4: The Parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened.

[The REAL Truth about the Air War over Ukraine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYDnspMWdaM), an interview based in part off of [this paper](https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/special-resources/russian-air-war-and-ukrainian-requirements-air-defence)

Some acronyms:

**SEAD** - Suppression of Enemy Air Defense

**GBAD** - Ground-Based Air Defense

I found this video to be an excellent, fact-packed interview with a guy who apparently had inside information from the Ukranian side. It includes some pretty clear cut answers about:

DRONES:

* the rise, fall, and overall value of the Byraktars
* the value of other drones
* drones may or may not be the future of air warfare, but in this war they are thought of as expendable with an average lifespan of e.g. 7 days - (excluding kamikaze drones)

THE FIRST DAYS:

* the successes and failures of Russian SEAD and Ukranian GBAD
* the heroic effort of the Ukranian air forces to hold back the Russians when their GBAD was offline or moving
* the huge weapons capability difference during this time frame, but similarly the huge information/terrain knowledge difference
* the Russian rules of engagement and comms plan failures

THE TRANSITION LOW:

* the retreat of the air war to low altitudes, the rise of MANPADS, the disadvantages of flying low on both sides
* the GBAD rebuild
* the effect of mobile and first response GBAD protecting Kyiv had on the overall defense plan, and hints on what this means for the future

HIMARS AND THE AIR WAR:

* how the continued protection of the HIMARS systems actually depends on air power and GBAD
* how Ukraine is having pick and choose GBAD to cover infrastructure/civilians or front lines but can't do both
* how this picture becomes **more and more untenable** as Ukraine gains more ground, which will begin to expose HIMARS systems
* ultimately, they need even more GBAD/SAM systems to ""lock in"" the costly won gains made in Kherson and Kharkiv which is, again, a strain on a limited resource

GIVING THEM PLANES:

* how it's still unclear what planes Ukraine can benefit from, from the obvious examples:
* F-16 - requires huge runways which will be attacked, complex and large crews and infrastructure, but lots of them around; likely to be a core part of Ukraine's air force post-ceasefire; expensive (although cheapest American option)
* F-18 (not supers); good for Austere runways, but not that many out there; not in great state; expensive
* Grippen - austere runway capable, ultra-durable, ultra-simple logistics, 6 man maintenance crew capable with only 1 highly trained; but politically very hard to see this happening
* however, for whatever fighters you might supply you don't need many of them because Russia has been rather protective and has kept their fighters high and tight well behind lines; if this were challenged, they may retreat further
* the argument that providing fighter jets is escalatory smells like bullshit to him; that any supplied fighters would be essentially defensive in nature (as a way to relieve GBAD); because there is no sense that Russian air power has totally collapsed; they have just stayed behind their own GBAD defenses

What does that mean? There has never been a formal declaration of war from either side. If Russia turned tail and fled what next? Ukraine still wants repayments, do they attack across the border until paid? Or more likely this is a call to the international community to keep up sanctions until reparations are made. Politically being forced to make reparation payments would just not be possible for Putin. If the war itself didn‚Äôt end him that definitely would. 

It‚Äôs an interesting change in tact and suggests total confidence is n UA success in all theatres. 

The ramifications for the wider geopolitical situation over the next 20 years are huge.

EDIT - lots of people getting hung up on the formal declaration of war line I wrote.  Forget about that. I'm aware of the historical precedence's, it's irrelevant to my larger point. 

What does the formal declaration of peace look like now?  In Feb it was go back to the 2014 borders.  It was later get out of our land, it is now get out and repay us for all damages. It's getting mighty close to get out, pay us for all damages and change your head of state. How do these demands get met?  in 1919 Germany was forced to pay reparations to have any chance of their economy surviving, not really through the fear of total defeat on a mostly stagnated battlefield. It was the economy that ended it not arms directly even though long term that was likely to fail.

Is that the scenario we are looking at now? MY point is how do Ukraine force the terms of the peace they want.  Driving the Russians out of their land is not enough to force reparations.

Come back in a few hours, this thread is being drowned by misinformation from dramatic Redditors thinking that NATO is going to roll over the Russian borders in a few hours.

**What happened?**

Two missiles were reported to have struck a Polish farm field killing two people. This town is extremely close to the Ukranian border.

**Ok, what's the problem?**

We don't know the origin. It was originally reported as Russian missiles, but since then there's been debate if that was the case. Now there are arguments that this was the result of a Ukranian missile blowing up a Russian missile, or even a possible Ukranian AD missile malfunction.

**So what's the big deal about origin?**

If this was a Russian missile hitting Poland, it would give the legal justification for Poland to activate Article 5 of the NATO treaty if they so chose.

""An attack on one is considered an attack on all.""

**Oh that's really bad, right?**

Well, yes. However sane minds will prevail if it is confirmed to be Russia. 

Russia has 0 incentive to attack a NATO member, and this is incredibly likely to have been stray missiles meant for Ukraine.

So unless anything comes to contradict that, Article 5 is off the table.

**Oh okay, so what will happen?**

The only thing that seems certain is that Poland will invoke Article 4, which means they'll get defense consultation from all of NATO.

Beyond that will be a question of what Poland wants to do. And this again, is why origin matters.

[Latest Charts (14 Nov)](https://www.reddit.com/r/maplady/comments/yvzgjk/ukrainian_territorial_control_as_of_14_november/)

\*\*What does the data show?\*\*In short, Ukraine controls 80.0% of her core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22, and 79.7% just 7 days ago. Before February's invasion, control was at 90.9%.

Since the Kharkiv counter-offensive began on 6 September, Ukrainian forces have liberated 1.4% of their territory (over 3,300 square miles), and have demonstrated that they can hold this territory.

üî¥ Russian KIAs are an estimated 32,100 (¬± 3,200), with a 30-day average of 50 KIA per day, down from last month's 80 KIA per day average.üü° Ukrainian KIAs are an estimated 13,800 (¬± 700), with a 30-day average of 20 KIA per day, down from last months' 30 KIA per day average.

In short, to track territorial control I run simple colour analysis on the daily update maps published by ISW, and chart how these colour proportions (one for Russia, one for Ukraine) have changed throughout the war. It should be taken as illustrative rather than scientific.

Russia purposely lauches missiles at Poland and says its an accident and nato does nothing, then more 'accidents' start to occur at more and more strategic targets until Poland asks Nato for support for an Article 5 declaration. 

Naturally Russia thinks the west are cowards and selfish so they think USA/UK/France/Germany will try to hold Poland back. This will cause Poland to become disillusioned with the west and leave NATO, and the Baltics seeing this also leave thinking the West will abandon them is Russia invades.

Russia will then invade or try to sway eastern Europe into their fold and maybe the rest of NATO disbands because everyone looks out for themselves.

>You can ""defend every inch"" by installing anti missile defense systems on Nato borders as well as supplying Ukraine with more weapons (maybe this pushes countries hesitant to send aid to do so).

So, no, just installing anti-missile defenses won't cut it. Russia is the belligerent. They invaded a sovereign European nation under false pretenses. They have now bombed NATO and threatened ""consequences"" if NATO takes steps to amplify its defenses.

&#x200B;

People need to stop being scared of Russia. They aren't going to end the world by being made to stay out of other countries and stop bombing civilians, but they sure as fuck will say they are. Because that's all they have left.

This is where quantity *does* have a quality of its own.

Cost to modify the drone dropped munitions for airburst and maybe double the effectiveness: lots, maybe thousands of dollars in R&D and manufacturing. Let's cheap out and predict with a rough order of magnitude, by some luck, it's $5000.

Cost to just drop an extra grenade taken from an old stockpile: $50. At most. Maybe closer to $5.

The whole point of this setup is that it's crazy cheap and relatively effective. If you want more boom, it's cheaper to drop more boom than improve the boom you drop.

It's almost certainly possible to build a munition that would allow airburst, but what Ukraine is using right now is just standard grenades of the kind an infantryman carries.

Two other officials said the failure rate was sometimes as high as 60%.

TL;DR of his speculation as to why they've not been supplied yet, other than the obvious stuff about ""provoking"" Russia.

- One ATACMS is about equivalent in cost to a full pod (six) GMLRS
- Russia has no current defense against GMLRS. Although that may change with software updates.
- ATACMS fly higher, are much larger, and are obviously in the air for longer. Russia may have a better answer to these.
- The solution may be to supply anti-radiation (air defense unit seeking) missiles *first*.

But if it came to Kyiv today, Ukraine would receive an assessment that it still needs to fulfill the requirements. Such critical reports are not tragic. They are even helpful for identifying problems. However, this is definitely different from what Kyiv sought when it fought for an official assessment and claimed that it would complete the implementation of the criteria in the autumn.

Hamas is bombing Israel indefinitely.  Hows that working out for them?

North Korea; on the other hand, is set up to bomb South Korea (shelling; Seoul being the target).

(even worse now that they have nukes). 

So for the Ukraine/Russia situation, I think Russia would eventually run out of missiles, and sanctions should prevent them from manufacturing new ones.  Ukraine and allies will need to continue to destroy or degrade Russia's ability to launch new strikes. If that means striking targets on Russian soil, that's one way. If that means maintaining a no-fly-zone over a demilitarized zone, 200-300km deep over Russia - that's Russia's problem to cry about.  If that means steeply ramping up sanctions against Russia, and Russia's allies who are providing necessary components for these long range missiles, then Ukraine and her allies will need to pucker up their assholes and do what needs to be done.

This is my reasoning based off of his interview, so it could be wrong:

The issue with HIMARS and SAMS is basically that the natural boundaries (the river, in particular, I'd guess) cut out a chunk of the range of these systems.

But it is not the same chunk:

* there is little ancillary value of putting SAMS right on the front lines up against the natural boundary; this makes these more attractive, not less attractive targets
* but SAMS protection is needed to protect HIMARS and to keep their range extended maximally
* but at some point, when battle lines are very clear and natural boundaries are very established, then the most effective way to counter HIMARS will just be observing the rocket trails at which point the SAMS are not really doing their job anyway.

Even if it was a Ukrainian anti air missile, the guys responsible for starting this event would be the same. Russian forces firing missiles with the intend to kill into the border territory of a NATO member.

My point is that it's a small town on the other side of the river ""Krasna Rika (red river)"". Given its size, you could expect Russian to not have many troops there (that would be stupid). It's a weak link to the south of Luhansk.

If Ukraine was to attack Kreminna and Svatove, it would leave a road on the other side of the river for logistics. So they could hold the line and use the river as a physical barrier.

If they take this town, they're cutting logistics on both side of the river. This means that logistic lines to Kreminna,Lysychansk are becoming almost twice as long if they keep the communication with Valukiy.

But where that's critical is that the moment Svatove is taken. They're in line with taking Troitske. When it reaches that moment. It will cut all communication line from Valukiy. If I'm not mistaken, the next city Russia can use for logistics is Chertkovo or Millerovo.. But those city don't have direct train access from Valukiy.

The way Russia's train network is built all roads leads to Moscow.. So if they want to drive tanks, trucks from Valukiy to Ukraine. It will drastically increase the distance to drive.

It's clearly in line with their usual salami-tactics. 

Putin's strategy is to always escalate and he's mad as hell about Kherson so he'll be keen to do something dramatic to shift the narrative (it's no accident that Trump's consistent reaction to outrage over something he did was to do something **even more outrageous** and then deny it/walk it back a little, sort of, wink-wink; that ""distraction + red-line blurring"" is straight from Putin's playbook). He really wants to do something way more dramatic than send 100 missiles in a day, but what can he get away with? It's very possible that this is a step in trying to figure that out -- ""would NATO really respond to a bigger provocation?

The nature of the debris found and the relatively small size of the crater strongly suggest it was a Ukrainian S300 (ie an air defence missile shot for the purposes of intercepting incoming missiles.

The location is also pretty consistent with that, when you look at the range of an s300 it's very close to where you would expect missiles defending Lviv to engage incoming russian missiles launched from Belarus- if an air defence missiles malfunctioned or wholly/partially missed a target, that is pretty much where it would end up. And Biden's comment strongly implies that's the conclusion they've reached. People are really stretching to try and conclude he meant otherwise.

So absolutely this is ultimately Russia's fault. They caused this war and they have absolutely no military justification for targeting civilians in western Ukraine, there's a huge risk of this sort of accident happening when you turn a border area into a war zone.

 >Kolberg is a 1945 Nazi German historical film directed by Veit Harlan. One of the last films of the Third Reich, it was intended as a Nazi propaganda piece to bolster the will of the German population to resist the Allies. The film is based on the autobiography of Joachim Nettelbeck, mayor of Kolberg in Pomerania, and on a play drawn from the book by Paul Heyse. It tells the story of the defence of the besieged fortress town of Kolberg against French troops between April and July 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars.

Any defense system will have to try and hit all of them. The real reason why they are getting through so much isn't a complete absence of air defense systems, but rather the fact that there isn't enough of them to pick off all of the missiles. It's actually a numbers game.   

A full volley of ATACMS in this scenario is just 3 distinct missiles (distinct by flight path and speed). Those will get picked off way easier.

56de8b656ea1b82d237ac2e773a26f57,yvm7vu,iwhi8o1,"That's a strawman. No one is against peace. 

The problem is that Putin's Russia has a long history of using negotiations in bad faith to stall for time and break the agreement as soon as it serves them. No one with a brain should believe Russia wants to negotiate for a lasting peace right now. They want Ukraine to lose momentum and give them a chance to train their mobiks and fix their supply lines.

That doesn't mean that peace is impossible. I see several paths to peace that don't involve dismantling Russia, but all of them require some change to the current status quo:

1. Palace coup or popular uprising (probably the former) in Russia leads to new leadership that Ukraine has more reason to trust to negotiate in good faith.

2. Collapse of the Russian army causes ""negotiated peace"" that looks a lot more like Russian surrender, with the final map looking identical or very similar to pre-2014 lines, and Russia agreeing to real, testable guarantees of Ukrainian security, such as dmz's on Russian side of the border or NATO bases on Ukrainian soil. These terms are out of the question right now for Russia while they still have combat strength left in them.

3. True stalemate and exhaustion on both sides leads to the lines solidifying into a position that can be negotiated into some kind of a Korean-style demilitarized zone. Still pretty far from that as the current trend is Ukraine compounding their advantages.

4. War expands beyond the boundaries of Ukraine. I think this scenario is the least likely but it cannot be ignored. If Russia or NATO escalates and this becomes a broader war, it will end quickly. This is the scary scenario, but I think the most likely version of it involves NATO winning a conventional war very quickly through the collapse of the Russian army. NATO will hopefully be very clear that they will not consider nuclear weapons unless Russia uses them first, and for all their saber-rattling Russia does not want a nuclear war (and from the state of all their military equipment, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't really have a functional nuclear deterrent.

Ukraine also isn't dumb enough to waste their precision weapons on civilian sites.

Striking military bases and staging areas. Even targeting the support infrastructure that maintains the military operations.

You cannot blow up a dam to cause a humanitarian crisis. You cannot attack the electrical grid of every city in the country with the only goal being to make the civilians suffer.

The maximum stated range of S300 and other Russian missile systems is against non-manouevring, fixed wing targets moving fast towards the launcher. Under those circumstances, the missiles can hit targets that were several hundred kilometres away \*at the time of launch\*, but at the time of impact they are far, far closer.

Against ballistic missile threats, S300's range is much, much lower - even as advertised by Russia. The variants that Ukraine operates have an advertised absolute maximum range against ballistic missile threats of only about 40km. For comparison, this is nearly double older Patriots but about 25% less than current Patriot missiles.

If this was a cruise missile targeted by S300, the range would be longer than for the ballistic missile threat but absolutely not 'hundreds of kilometres' unless that cruise missile was targeting the S300 battery itself - which it clearly wasn't, because it landed in Poland.

 >Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was an international passenger flight operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia to its planned destination, Beijing Capital International Airport. The crew of the Boeing 777-200ER registered as 9M-MRO, last communicated with air traffic control (ATC) around 38 minutes after takeoff when the flight was over the South China Sea. The aircraft was lost from ATC radar screens minutes later, but was tracked by military radar for another hour, deviating westwards from its planned flight path, crossing the Malay Peninsula and Andaman Sea.

Which in international law refers to the inherent right of a State to a **necessary and proportionate use of force to repel an attack or imminent threat of attack directed against oneself or others.**

So no offensive. Only defense. And within ""reason"".

And if destroying missiles silos an attacker used to attack is still considered self defense, compared to say intercept the missiles.

Article 5

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, **in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations**, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, **such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force**, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

On defense, there's a significant collateral impact because destruction of forward depots means you have to move them back.  And yes, this frustrates logistics.  But it also has an inventory effect. 

When you move a depot back, what that means is that resupply takes longer.  So you have to move inventories forward in order to maintain defensive-survival time of an emplacement (shells on hand / resupply interval).  either that, or you risk that it will be overrun.  So you increase forward inventories.

And that is multiplied across the entire front, leveraged by the resupply ratio (e.g. each depot serves 1/K of the line)...  because instead of having 1 unit of inventory at the back serving whichever 1/K of the line is being attacked, you need K as much inventory on the front line, to maintain the same defensive effect for the same amount of time.  Assuming K is in the range of 3-10, you can vastly increase inventory consumption simply to compensate for the increased distance.

Then there's a psychological impact.  When you multiply the amount of ammunition at forward emplacements, you also increase consumption, because when faced with what looks like abundance of ammunition, local command is going to prioritize consumption over conservation in the face of a probing attack until it doesn't look like abundance.   

Finally, there's a loss impact.  Again, if you put inventories forward, more inventory gets destroyed when targeted by counter-battery fire, and/or supply interdiction. 

All of this adds up very quickly. 

If you are Russia, and your local command is untrained and undisciplined, the ultimate effect is significant depletion of inventory just by moving depots further back.

Prior to August 8 1945, Japan hoped to use the Soviet Union (which was still neutral at the time) as an intermediary to negotiate with the rest of the Allies. They were hoping that the prospect of a land invasion against a defiant civilian populace would be off-putting enough to result in some terms that were favorable to Japan.

The firebombing of Tokyo (and other cities), along with the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima were meant to send a message to Japan: We don't need to land on your shores to destroy you. In August 1945, Japan's navy was no longer functional and their aircraft couldn't intercept B-29 bombers flying at altitude.

When the Soviet Union declared war on August 8 1945, Japan was in a hopeless situation. They were diplomatically isolated in that they had no intermediary through whom they could conduct negotiations, and they were physically isolated in that their entire nation was cut-off economically by the US Navy.

I think perhaps this is the same idea that you can't really effectively use SAMS as an offensive weapon under any circumstances combined with the fact that neither side is prepared for large scale amphibious warfare at the moment.

So Russia will know very exactly where the maximum extent of SAM systems are, and they will know that Ukraine will probably not be bringing HIMARS into the front lines of that region; and therefore they will not be deploying SAMs in that region because their coverage areas are large circles which are, in effect, partially wasted on the front lines. 

So there is this leapfrogging effect where you keep both SAMS and HIMARS back to preserve both, because both are in relatively limited supply.

And the culminating point is that eventually, as you get closer and closer, the circumstantial/luck based destruction of HIMARS systems becomes more and more likely because they are ultra difficult to hit with counter battery and artillery, but will eventually run into the edges of the Russian air force; and the first HIMARS destructions will probably be based on luck/visual observation and not technology.

The overall idea is that this geographic feature which is, say, less than 1 mile wide (the river) actually ends up eating a much, much larger chunk out of the range of both systems (HIMARS and SAMS) than is obvious from first inspection; and this eating up of range happens in a way that his a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem because both are so valuable.",False,1668495092.0,t3_yvm7vu,t1_iwfjnjv,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is a political role, not an operational one. It's a presidential appointment that is prohibited by law from having any direct operational command in the military.

More generally they are an overseer and a go-between for civilian leaders and commanders.

Russia demoting capable generals because of the optics of poor performance that is largely out of their control due someone else's flawed strategy is one thing. 

But for the CJCS, like others advisor or like cabinet members, if the President cannot trust them in honest and candid deliberations then that is a problem well beyond optics.

That is, if after deliberations the President decides to continue to direct the various branches of the military to support Ukraine with weapons transfers, intelligence, and other means, with the explicit policy objective of resisting and deterring Russia from maintaining control of territory, then the CJCS publicly undermining that policy after losing the private debate is a serious problem.

Russia invaded Crimea.
Russia annexed Crimea.
Russia invaded Ukraine.
Russia bombed civilian corridors.

Russia cut off gas supplies.
Russia committed an untold number of war crimes.
Russia took a nuclear power plant hostage.
Russia fired missiles at Poland and killed Polish citizens.
9 months later Russia is still invading Ukraine, still committing warcrimes, and now killing NATO citizens.

At what point is somebody (other than Ukraine) going to finally and definitively say ""Russia, fuck off""?

We haven't done much to protect civvies in Ukraine (outside of aid packages and border hopping, I mean things like NFZ and international observers, peacekeepers, humanitarian aid packages in blockaded cities), we haven't done enough to end Russia's blackmailing with gas/oil (paying in Rubles and buying off countries buying off Russia, although weaning off gas directly was a good move), and now we're probably going to do fuck-all protecting or retaliating for civilian deaths in NATO territory.

I'm of the opinion that Russia is going to keep pushing the envelope to the point conflict is inevitable (if you disagree please point to the thing that you think will make Russia stop being aggressive), so things will continue to escalate until somebody actually puts Russia in their place.

It doesn't have to be boots on the ground but protecting the airspace from wayward missiles would be a nice start (or disabling the site that launched the attack). Amazing it hasn't happened already, 9 months into the conflict.

Also true, but NATO can also do whatever it wants as well.

-  You will need to gather a few major components. A battery, a panel, wire (an extension cord is great for this), and a charge controller are the bare minimum. If you want to get fancy, a couple of fuse holders will make the setup a bit safer as well

- The best way to save money doing this will be to find a cheap/free car battery that can still hold a charge. This is also the worst option though, as non-sealed lead acid batteries can vent dangerous fumes. But don't let this freak you out too much, the fumes are very minimal and keeping it near a window or some other HVAC component should be plenty to elimate the danger. You can make pretty much any type of battery that holds a charge work, but make sure you have an electrician assess its suitability.

If you have a bit more money to spend, an AGM or universal battery will perform better and can be kept anywhere. I won't go into details about lithium setups, if you have the money for this you don't need me. Assuming you use a 12V battery, every 2ah of capacity should charge a phone once, or power an LED bulb for a few hours.

- Next you will need to source a charge controller and solar panel. You can find both for ridiculously little money now, And anything rated at 20 watts or above should be plenty for light duty. Obviously the more the better though. 

- Lastly, round up some wire (I recommend an extension cord, most people already have a busted one laying around, but really anything should work, as long as it has at least two conductors and isn't ridiculously thin 


Now that you have all the stuff, you just need to wire it all together 

You will have two wires coming from the panel, these go into the input side of the charge controller. Then you will take two wires from the output side of the charge controller and connect them to the terminals of the battery. Just make sure you connect positive to positive and negative to negative, there isn't much to go wrong here. You can add an inline fuse on the positive side 6-12 inches from the panel to make safer.

Last is distribution. All you need to do here is run the positive and negative into some type of distribution block, or just straight to a 12v outlet if you only want to do the basics. As with the solar panel, adding a fuse or breaker for each load will improve safety, or if you really need keep costs down putting a single fuse on the main feed coming from the battery. This is definitely best practise, but a dinky unfused 12v battery will hardly be the most dangerous thing around in an active warzone.

So, upon review of the wiki page on Japan's surrender, it seems the Soviet invasion and the atomic bombs were jointly (and inextricably) responsible for Japan's surrender.  Even the Emperor talked out both sides of his mouth; to the public, the bombs were the reason for surrender, and to the army, the USSR's invasion plans for Japan.  They happened within 3 days of each other.  But the war would definitely have dragged on longer if the USSR hadn't declared war on Japan, and if Japan figured out how long it would have taken us to drop a third bomb, it could have gone on for even longer still.

My belief is that Putin (along with the rest of us) thought this was a quick low risk land/power grab. Similar to Georgia, Crimea, and Syria. He probably calculated that there would be sanctions for a few years but elections and greed would eventually cause those sanctions to be lifted.

Everyone underestimated Ukraine's willingness to fight and the subsequent EU/NATO willingness to equip the fighting Ukrainians.

Realizing his original goals are no longer achievable, I think Putin is now trying to win concessions for ending the war. I think the only thing he absolutely wants is Crimea. If he can get Ukraine to officially cede any claims to Crimea as part of peace negotiations, it will be a victory for him.

It will be very easy for him to spin it with some bullshit like: ""We went in to protect our brothers and sisters in Ukraine but the cost to the lives of Russian heroes is too great to continue. We are relocating those who wish to leave Ukraine within our borders and will leave Ukraine to suffer its own fate.""

I think Putin's plans are now to hope that NATO and EU support wanes over time and Ukraine will be forced to make a hard decision in the next couple years. How long does Ukraine continue to fight a war that is costing thousands of Ukrainian lives, crushing it's economy, and devastating all of it's infrastructure?

I never thought I'd find myself rooting for the FSB but I'll take the lesser evil here, even if it's still fucking evil as hell. At least Patrushev, if he kept control of government, likely wouldn't rule himself, but would stick some soulless goon like Mishustin in charge and get to work preparing a palatable successor who would at least keep the status quo. The siloviki want power and control, but they're happy not to be the face of it. 

Unfortunately the only way I can see an age of democracy coming here is if the inevitable regime change ends up with the siloviki and the military mafia (can't think of a better word for someone like Prigozhin) end up in a violent power struggle and kill each other off. For people like Navalny, Schulman, Katz, and other democrats to have a chance at erecting some sort of proper democracy, there really needs to be no powerful police / intelligence state with the power to stop them. 

The one hopeful prospect are the oligarchs, who certainly want a country where they can keep earning billions and enjoy life on their super yachts. They might well see democracy as a much better prospect than autocracy and subservience to Putin 2.0, and although they don't have much hard power, they could decide to throw whatever resources and influence they have behind a ""democratic reformer"", even if it means they won't end up as rich as they used to be. But as I say, they could only safely do this as long as FSB, Prigozhin, and other powerful shitheads aren't able to stop them. If the Russian military was a bit more confident and organized it would help having them side with the people, but I'm really not even sure if Russian armed forces could even go toe to toe with the police state.

>  
>...  
>  
>The resulting flight path plan as well as the algorithm for course adjustments based on various inputs is loaded by the programmers onto a ruggedized memory stick, which is then passed on to the launch location and inserted into the missile.

This is describing nap-of-the-Earth flying, which necessarily involves manouevring so the missile doesn't become a torpedo.

The S300/S400 maximum range calculations aren't public, but probably describe a supersonic bomber target like a B-1 flying directly at the launcher and at very high altitude. All of these features increase the range of the S300 missile: the speed of the target closes its range quickly before impact, the azimuth makes that range closure more efficient and reduces the need to lead the target, and the high altitude allows the S300 missile to maintain its kinetic energy in a low-drag atmosphere for longer. Cruise missiles like Kh-101 fly subsonically, at low altitude, and follow the terrain - not one similar feature.

And finally, I'm not assuming 40km. I even said that:

> that a HIMARS without a SAM site is likely to be hit

I think the idea is: the reason we haven't seen HIMARS systems lost is because they are operating well within the shadow of Ukraine's GBAD. 

> that NASAMs can't just move with the HIMARS unit

I hope I haven't said this; I certainly don't want to suggest it. But Russia can be pretty sure that Ukraine isn't operating either system on the east bank of the Dniper. So for the purposes of the Russian air force, who is still flying ultra-low to avoid SAM systems in general, until they cross the Dniper they can assume they are OK as far as SAMS goes.

But barring an awesome breakout over the dniper, there isn't going to be an obvious need for CAS like there was before on the edges of the battle lines. There aren't going to be fluid battle lines in the newly won areas. The areas from which HIMARS shots would begin to target more and more bases in Crimea. If we believe neither side is going to have a major amphibious assault, then CAS pilots and other support sorties can (and should, arguably) switch to high value target work (HIMARS hunting).

In general, having listened to this and typed out my messages to you, this is a very complex geographical situation and I'm sure the US and Ukraine are very aware of what the limitations are. It's interesting to note how much ""dead zone"" there is with the Dniper and the sand pits, etc, behind them - which add a huge distance between Ukraine the logistics targets behind.

1)They have EU/USA passports, manage to somehow clean their hands of Putin (like Tinkoff paying USA taxes) which lets them live in the west probably with generally no long term consequences 

2) People like Alisher Usmanov that are so evil, corrupt, that they basically have to stay near Putin.

In that case the pilot keeps changing his direction constantly forcing the missile tracking him to keep using fuel in order to keep tracking the target. Cruise missile doesn't do that, it doesn't even have equipment to know when it's being tracked by something - so it wouldn't know when it needs to wildly change directions. 

It just flies straight and sometimes changes direction to avoid mountains. Sure it's low altitude makes it harder to detect - but the fact that S300 doesn't need to climb tens of kilometers to get to it means S300 has a lot more fuel left to play with when compared to the Strategic Bomber scenario you're describing. So the only thing I'd expect to make S300 use more fuel is the fact that the incoming cruise missile is flying slower so given same launch distances the S300 would have to go further to get to it. Not really something that would cut its range to like 30% of its max.

That's what manouevring means, my dude. Every change in course requires a lead adjustment, costing the missile energy, shortening its range. You don't have to be a supersonic jet going defensive to have that effect.

Oh, and since you mention the low altitude of the missiles, at their maximum advertised cruising altitude of seventy metres AGL, a Kh-101 only appears visible over the radar horizon at around 21nm.

I can only speak for the US, but yeah, if our government said Russia was lying, there would be support.

But this is all very convoluted. Far more likely in that scenario is that NATO would respond, in secret, in a proportional way. Either through a covert mission or through assets to Ukraine. Or it would be a proportional public response that the public would have no issues with.
