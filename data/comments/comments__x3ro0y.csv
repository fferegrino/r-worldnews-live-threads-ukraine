>In the operational zone of the South Buz direction, the situation is stable, difficult, but controlled. The destruction of enemy stocks and reserves, destruction of control points and fire control of transport routes continues. The enemy army is mostly demoralized, but is resisting desperately. Trying to maintain the defense on land, the enemy continues artillery and mortar attacks, as well as air and missile strikes on our positions, on peaceful settlements, and on local residents. Three times during the day, fighter jets and an attack aircraft fired missile strikes at our positions in the Berislavsky district, without casualties. Instead, one of the stormtroopers was damaged. The results are being investigated. The enemy carried out a bombardment with high-explosive five-hundred-kilogram aerial bombs in the Mykolaiv district, where one civilian was wounded. Continued to attack Mykolaiv Oblast, by firing an air-launched missile from a Su-35 fighter over the Berezneguvat community. Air defense forces worked perfectly, the missile was destroyed. Our aircraft carried out 18 strikes on command and support posts, warehouses with ammunition and fuel and lubricants, and logistics and transport facilities. Missile and artillery units worked out a number of firing tasks at 9 control points, 2 ferry crossings, 2 control points for drones, at anti-aircraft defense means and at enemy concentration. Fire control over the Antonivskyi, Kakhovskyi and Dariivskyi bridges continues. It was established that, as a result of the combat day, the enemy's forces were reduced by 102 rashists, 6 tanks, a howitzer ""Msta-B"", a rocket salvo fire system ""Grad"", a mobile 120-mm mortar, 8 units of auto-armored vehicles. 5 ammunition depots were destroyed in Bashtan, Berislav and Kherson districts. The drone control center in the Pravdyny district and the ferry crossing near Kozatskyi were hit. In the Black Sea, the ship group did not undergo changes in its composition and tasks. As before, 3 Kalibr-type missile carriers are on standby, 1 of which is underwater. The total volley is 20 missiles. Threats and predicted enemy activity indicate the need to promptly and correctly respond to air warning signals. Be alert and attentive, do not ignore warnings of danger either from the air, or on the coast, or in coastal waters. Our consciousness and thoughtfulness are the best weapons against fakes and enemy propaganda, a responsible attitude to air warning signals is a way to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

**Announced today:**

**Economic Sanctions against collaborating teachers** https://glavcom.ua/country/science/ukrajina-zaprovadit-sanktsiji-proti-vikladachiv-kolaborantiv-872548.html  Introduced today, past the criminal liabilities for cooperating with the occupiers, economic sanctions for 5 years will be imposed on them.

The Rada will not charge parents with collaboration if they choose to send children to these Russian-controlled schools, where children will be subjected to “reprogramming,” but will work with parents after war to get children assistance in coping with the psychological dissonance caused by the propaganda.

The Minister of Justice, as well as the *Servant of the People* deputy who chairs the education committee both explain that there’s **no such thing as “collaborated because just trying to survive,”** and that teachers who collaborate have made a **free choice** to do so—that Ukraine has provided many alternatives, including 2/3 pay and literally just staying home—or flee, do online school from Ukraine-controlled territory at normal pay.

Day 191 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was quite a lot of shelling, and also a lot of missiles were fired at us. Not all shelling was aimed at the city, they shelled Tsyrkuny and Derhachi a couple of times today, both of which borders Kharkiv, so we heard it here all the same, we also saw the smoke from that shelling from our windows. They shelled the city as well, and a couple of times too, at 10:45pm, then at 11pm, and then again at 11:30pm.

They also did more than one missile strike again. First one happened at 10:50pm with just one missile, which landed in Kharkiv oblast. Then there was another missile strike at 11:30pm, we don’t know where those landed. And then they did a third missile strike at 12:20am, the biggest one of the day, they fired 5-6 missiles, some of which landed in Kharkiv. They also shelled us with MLRS during missile launches.

One of today’s missiles landed near in a school, shattering some windows, but not doing much more damage, thankfully there were no casualties. And in yesterday’s missile strike they aimed at a sports complex, destroying a pool and a boxing club, also with no casualties. As always there was nothing military related there, they just destroyed half of a sports complex for no reason.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised a price cap measure on Russian oil devised by G-7 countries in response to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

The cap, designed to further cripple the Russian economy and discourage the Kremlin from pursuing its assault on Ukraine, will remove a major funding source for the war while maintaining oil supplies on the global energy market by forcing the Eastern European nation to sell its product at a cheaper cost without cutting off a crucial fuel source.

Yellen called the plan a “critical step forward in achieving our dual goals of putting downward pressure on global energy prices while denying Putin revenue to fund his brutal war in Ukraine.”

“This price cap is one of the most powerful tools we have to fight inflation and protect workers and businesses in the United States and globally from future price spikes caused by global disruptions,” Yellen said in a statement. “We have already begun to see the impact of the price cap through Russia’s hurried attempts to negotiate bilateral oil trades at massive discounts.”

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 2 September 2022


- Heavy fighting continues in southern Ukraine, including shelling in Enerhodar district, near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.

- Despite the war in Ukraine, on 01 September, the Russian military started exercise Vostok 22, its annual Joint Strategic Exercise, marking the culmination of the military training year. Russia publicly claimed that 50,000 troops will take part, however, it's unlikely that more than 15,000 personnel will be actively involved this year. This is around 20% of the forces which participated in the last Vostok exercise in 2018.

- Russia's military performance in Ukraine has highlighted that Russia's military strategic exercises, such as Vostok, have failed to sustain the military's ability to conduct large scale, complex operations. Such events are heavily scripted, do not encourage initiative, and primarily aim to impress Russian leaders and international audiences.",False,1662098504.0,t3_x3ro0y,t3_x3ro0y,,0,70,0,70,0,0,

Grossi, of the IAEA, didn’t initially seem to give concrete information 
[in his press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgVpnyVOEUs) indicating that they found evidence, or even suspected, that Russia was responsible for anything malicious at the ZNPP.  

Honestly, it [seemed like](https://glavcom.ua/country/incidents/fizichna-tsilisnist-zaes-porushena-hrossi-872584.html) he’s either been [fooled](https://glavcom.ua/country/incidents/vizit-mahate-na-zaes-stalo-vidomo-kudi-rashisti-zakhovali-tekhniku-872537.html)
 or is being intentionally neutral (a la Erdogan).  But I suspect that that’s not it—that since [six representatives of IAEA stayed behind to continue to investigate](https://glavcom.ua/country/incidents/na-zaes-zalishilisja-shestero-predstavnikiv-mahate-hrossi-872586.html), and so it’s both about keeping them safe as well as preserving secrecy until investigation complete.
Further, an interaction was published where Grossi asked the Occupiers’ Director, from Rosatom, [why the impact of a shell indicated that it came from the direction that is occupied by Russia](https://glavcom.ua/video/hlava-mahate-zadav-duzhe-nezruchne-pitannja-okupantam-video-872523.html)
—which was answered that the projectile must’ve done a 180° turn—an answer so absurd that to not challenge it demonstrates keeping cards close to vest.

In the [press briefing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgVpnyVOEUs), Grossi did disclose this important bit of information, that we can deduce they have not been fooled by Russia—he indicated that the impact location were not haphazard, not in direly dangerous spots, or random—but rather were strategically, carefully chosen spots on the premises—demonstrating that was targeted under the guidance of someone with insider expertise.  

That is exactly, precisely what Ukraine has alleged—that the occupiers brought over nuclear engineers (from Rosatom)^1 who guide the attacks—both from the premises itself^2, and from down the road.  And the goal was never to destroy, but to force reliance on Russia, so that Russia could connect directly to ZNPP at some point, so always strategically launch attacks.^3


The reason it’s so important that IAEA finds Russia at fault is [laid out](https://suspilne-media.translate.goog/275074-rosiani-teroristi-ale-ne-beztolkovi-voni-ne-hocut-pomerti-vid-adernogo-vibuhu-intervu-zi-spivrobitnikom-zaes/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp):


> *How can the situation at the ZNPP change after the arrival of the IAEA mission?*

> Likely, the IAEA mission will make some kind of report on violations, on some shelled walls, on personnel under pressure. They will publish that report and say that the station can no longer work like this. And the Russians will say, “yes, fine, we intended it.”

> For example, now the Russians are using modernized projects of Soviet nuclear power plants to build stations in other countries, for example, India, China, Belarus. That is, in fact, they pump petrodollars into the atom. It just needs to be covered and that's it. 

> Well, if the IAEA were to declare that if the Russians wont withdraw from ZNPP and demilitarize the thirty-kilometer zone around the plant, then their Rosatom will be under sanctions—well, that is another matter. And so there will be deep concern [for Russia about their contracts in China and India].

What will their ‘help’ be? To connect the ZNPP with the power system of the Russian Federation. . . so if a blackout occurs, we will need their power . . .

Setting a deadline is one of his favorite tactics to light a fire under the Russian military's ass when they are struggling. The last two times we saw this was in Mariupol and Severodonetsk. In both, the Russian forces struggled heavily despite their advantages and were probably tempted to stop and focus on an easier target. The deadline was almost a restatement that capture must be accomplished regardless of the cost, which is what happened. However, in both cases, the price might not have been worth it. 

Focusing on Mariupol diverted Russia's strength away from Kyiv and Kharkiv, allowing Ukraine to liberate those cities and push Russia completely out of Kyiv oblast. It probably also sapped away the strength needed to take Mykolaiv and Odessa. 

Taking Severodonetsk bogged down Russia's military when Ukraine was at its weakest point. Ukraine was running out of its initial weapons, its troops were exhausted from months of fighting, and the new troops and weapons weren't ready to be used yet. Focusing on one city bought Ukraine the time it needed to start building strength back while heavily bleeding Russia. 

It feels like Putin is making the exact same mistake all over again. Declaring Russia is focusing on taking Donetsk by September 15th means that Putin will be furious if Russia doesn't take all of Donetsk even if the deadline is blown. That is dangerous for Russia as it puts them at a high risk of losing other captured territories as happened with Mariupol as Ukraine is likely stronger now than they were back in April.",False,1662151910.0,t3_x3ro0y,t3_x3ro0y,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

Firstly; The Bundeswehr is horribly underfunded and have little more to offer besides allowing other EU and NATO members to backfill from German MIIC production which is mostly geared towards foreign purchases. The Heer in particular has been complaining about the lack of readiness for almost a decade and everyone from Obama to the Ukrainians themselves have chided their lack of equipment during that same time. The Ukrainian problem with the Germans in this war was the lack of urgency to support them in February, which the Germans have more than made up for.  

Second; The Gripen is not a solution for Ukraine's air force for a long list of reasons. First off there aren't enough Gripens to equip the Ukrainians for a major war and spare parts are even rarer, ""low maintenance costs"" don't count for anything *when the parts don't exist.* Next, the Gripen costs more than any other options on the table, with a flyaway cost about 5-10 Million more than even the F35, meaning that Ukraine would have even fewer planes available long term than if they chose another option. Lastly the Gripen isn't equipped to use most of the weapons that the US would be providing to Ukraine, the US and countries like Poland that fly US made planes are the biggest backers of Ukraine and they can't have any supply bottlenecks.",1662136875.0,1662136504.0,t3_x3ro0y,t3_x3ro0y,,0,42,0,42,0,0,

If Orban does favor Putin, then why? Why would he align Hungary with a political sphere that is shrinking in wealth, power, and influence? Why not maintain close relations with the EU and NATO, which affords Hungary with enormous protection and economic opportunity? Also being part of a large block increases Hungary's political influence and credibility.

There was also preventing Ukraine from joining OTAN, but I will consider it as a diplomatic objective that became unachievable once the fighting started.

Yes, they tried to achieve those objectives by rushing to Kiev, but Putin did not say Russia needed to completely invade Ukraine. 

Now, those objectives have been upgraded to Donbass, land bridge through Mariupol and water access through Kherson. Putin can probably claim ""denazification"" as been achieved by destroying the most known Ukrainian nationalistic militias (Azov battalion). Putin

If he finishes taking Donetsk Oblast, then freeze the front lines or even obtain a peace agreement, he can claim victory. 

If the frontlines do not move anymore, he can claim near complete victory (well beyond the original objectives). But he will need help from China and India to put peacekeepers in front of Donetsk city and prevent shelling from Ukraine.

If the counter-offensive start steam rolling the Ukrainian army, he might be sacrificed by the Oligarchs by having to threaten the use of nukes to secure a ceasefire, then leave power in disgrace.

In all case, the oligarchs will want a return of the relationship with Europe and end of the sanction. This means retiring Putin in a few years, then use him as a scapegoat for the war.

Important point: The oligarchs need to use Putin as a scapegoat for the war and for the option threatening to use nukes. This means keeping him around until the war has ended.

If we take a middle scenario, where Russia kept large parts of the conquered ground on the long term, we can predict the following: Putin claims that the special military operation has been a success.

The polar orbit means you get multiple pictures daily at fixed time increments with the only variables being weather and how many satellites you have.  The US probably can get a picture of any clear sky area of the world in something like 15-30 minutes.

I’m sure the satellite gyros are stable enough to shoot video but who knows what the framerate might be?  Probably less than the 30fps of a movie projector.

Edit.  Geosynchronous orbits as some have referenced itt are much, much further away and aren’t used for imagining satellites for this reason.  Those are communication satellites, but are ineffective for high latitudes (because they’re all located directly above the equator). Due to the northern latitudes in some Russian territory, the Russians use highly elliptical orbits for communication satellites, which means their dishes have to track but the elliptical orbit means they track slower than what would be needed for a low earth orbit.",1662113803.0,1662113386.0,t3_x3ro0y,t1_imrsvcw,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

If a drone has munitions, obviously it drops them rather than fuck around and if it is tiny and its purpose is simply to designate the target for other artillery in the fashion of a range finder or laser designator..why wouldn't it just hover and do that with a laser designator?

If it stays in the air it's less likely to be physically seen, far safer from being destroyed less susceptible to someone noticing it and sticking it on a passing bus or something and...you get your drone back rather than losing it in the ensuing explosion, so it can immediately designate another target plus  shoot footage of the after effect of the strike.

That said, if they were very very unobtrusive, tamper proof and with a very long battery life in standby mode I can think of one way this sort of spy drone might become extremely useful- if it included a magnetometer (ie a device capable of detecting nearby magnetic fields of sufficient strength) it seems to me technically conceivable, you would end up with a device that not only told you where the tank it had stuck on was, but also told you when that tank was close to a significant number of other tanks or trucks (because of the presence of multiple large magnetic fields moving near it.)

There are plenty of situations, for example Ukraine right now, where their challenge with systems like Himars is not accurately hitting targets, but finding sufficiently valuable targets to justify the cost of the rockets.

If you had devices which would stick on a tank, power down and sit there for days or months until it registered a sufficiently strong magnetic field near it to tell you it was near a lot of other large metal vehicles - *then* power up and send its coordinates that seems to me that would be quite handy- you could basically stick them on any solitary vehicles that didn't justify a heavy artillery strike and see where they ended up.

Expanding on and perhaps arguing with your second point a little:

I suspect that *availability* of airframes and/or production capacity will be the limiting factor in what is given to or purchased by Ukraine. The F-16 or F-35 may be the most cost effective for their ""generation"", but both are heavily backordered. So unless someone wants to give up their spot in the production queue (somewhat unlikely given the situations with Russia and China), Ukraine probably will need to look elsewhere.

From a quick look at public info, it looks like Saab doesn't exactly have a long line of buyers waiting for their airframes. If (big if) Saab can quickly spin up production of aircraft and associated spares and logistics, it may be the best choice for Ukraine.

Also, later models of the Gripen are noted to be fully NATO weapon capable, so that simplifies that issue.

Personal opinion: PDA used F-16s are the most likely in the near future, possibly with a side of PDA A-10s (mostly because I foresee the USAF arguing less about them than F-16s).",1662140462.0,1662138066.0,t3_x3ro0y,t1_imtdn4u,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

He also sometimes tries to play on nationalistic or irredentist ideas for support. In the case of Ukraine, its about language rights for Hungarians living there, and about parts of western Ukraine that were once part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

While in the end Orban has to conform to EU directives, the does so by doing the absolute minimum at the absolute latest date possible. Sometimes he goes outright against EU directives (see various infringements, and threats from EU).

The same with NATO and not agreeing passage for military aid for Ukraine.

A somewhat extreme example: Japan opted to design their own tank suitable for their islands but also has laws against exporting their weapons. So Japan only built a small number of Type 10s (about 100). Between 2010 and 2020 they built about 1 per month. Mitsubishi certainly could have knocked out that order in a year or two instead of everyone agreeing to stretching it out over more than a decade.

In the case of knocking the order out in a year or two, those workers would have moved on to other jobs and the manufacturing equipment would get -at best- stuffed in a warehouse or -at worst- recycled. Should Japan have found itself in a war, they would have to restart the production from 0.

Even with a reactive armor package I do not believe a Bradley could withstand a direct hit from the main gun of a T-72.[ The info sheet on the system](https://www.gd-ots.com/protection-systems/force-protection-systems/reactive-armor-bradley-fighting-vehicle/#:~:text=Reactive%20Armor%20%E2%80%93%20Bradley%20Fighting%20Vehicle&text=The%20Reactive%20Armor%20technology%20offers,launched%2C%20shaped%2Dcharge%20systems.) only claims effectiveness against ""shoulder-fired weapons and most tube-launched, shaped-charge systems."" That does not seem to include taking a hit 125 mm HEAT round or an APFSDS round, assuming the Russians are even using any in Ukraine. The Bradley's armor only goes up to 30 mm as standard. I don't see how an applique kit and some reactive armor are going to enable it to withstand a shot from a T-72.

Now I do think the Bradley using a TOW missile top down attack variant or the tandem warhead would probably give a T-72 a seriously bad day but to use the phrase it ""can dance"" with one to me means that the Bradley should at least have a chance of surviving a direct hit from a T-72. Even with all the bells and whistles applied to it it doesn't seem like it would. Now the Bradley would probably have a far better fire control system than a T-72 and if it sees it first it might kill it before it takes a hit and it did tear through Iraqi T-72's but those were downgraded export variants and the Iraqi's did not have the best ammo available. I don't know it just seems like an over enthusiastic appraisal of a Bradley versus a main battle tank, even one as old a design as the T-72. 

I do think the Bradley would be useful in Ukraine but I am not sure it would be as valuable as getting them another main battle tank that could simply manhandle Russian T-72's and not be as vulnerable as the Bradley is. Every additional system Ukraine takes on has all the much discussed training and logistical challenges behind it. We've already given them hundreds of M-113's to move troops around, it seems like a Western main battle tank would be more useful an addition than the Bradley even if the maintenance and fuel requirements were even more of a challenge. I'm not saying Abrams is the right choice but neither do I think a Bradley is a good fit at this time.",False,1662168977.0,t3_x3ro0y,t1_imuu5rr,,4,2,0,2,0,0,

Under the agreement, the signatories offered Ukraine ""security assurances"" in exchange for its adherence to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The memorandum bundled together a set of assurances that Ukraine had already held from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) Final Act, the United Nations Charter and the Non-Proliferation Treaty\[1\] but the Ukrainian government found it valuable to have these assurances in a Ukraine-specific document.\[45\]\[46\]

>Your point about M1s in the back field is a far more viable option. But you still have all the parts requirements with adding more and more types of equipment.

My reasoning for back field is two fold. First, that they won't be getting as much wear by sitting in a position running their APU (auxiliary generator, added to avoid running the turbine), so wear would be minimized, mitigating the need for parts. Second, they are closer to the Polish border and thus the supply line of alternate parts would be shorter.

It was a simple security guarantee from UK, US, and Russia to Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus that stated the three former would not attack the latter, except in a defensive mode. It further stated that any attack on the latter by a third party would be reported to the UN security council by the former. That did happen - the US and UK brought it before the UN security council, but Russia quashed it. The US fulfilled their end of the bargain. The UK fulfilled their end of the bargain. Russia broke a couple/few different agreements by taking on Ukraine.

But, again, Ukraine was not in a defensive alliance with any other countries, especially NATO. NATO requires countries to codify in law that any attack on one will be considered an attack on each and every member AND requires a response. Contrary to popular belief, that response does not have to be militarily enacted. That said, the US is far and away the largest military force in NATO and would certainly respond with military force to any military action against a NATO member, with few exceptions.

Ukraine tried to join NATO but was at the time under very corrupt leadership and couldn't be called a functioning democracy. They couldn't meet the requirements for NATO membership, for a variety of complex reasons (including Russian meddling), and did not have a large enough internal push to meet those standards and drive for membership in NATO or the EU. It really sucks, but it is what it is. Considering those facts, I am impressed with the level of support they have received.

That is just a part of what is starting to really bite Russia in the ass, they are running out of the ability to repair tanks in the field.

re the indirect fire thing; there have been instances of Ukraine doing it in this war.  There is an unconfirmed (like most things in war) kill by a Ukraine tank on a Russian tank at over 10km this fight (this was a few days back now).  Again it isn't SUPER important, but when every single thing might win or lose a battle they all are worth considering.
