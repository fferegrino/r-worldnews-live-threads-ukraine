🪖  [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1560079899330842624), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559956582942785540.html),  and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1560037224015695873.html) covered today’s border changes.

🍄 In a followup to yesterday’s attacks; Ukraine claimed responsibility for [the three bombings in Crimea](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1559941610141523968).  Unfortunately, [no major damage](https://twitter.com/RALee85/status/1560034331409764353) was observed at the airbase.  The attack has scared russia though as it [pulls its aircraft out of Crimea](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1559963717860737024) to base them in russia.

🍄  US policy on the Crimea strikes is crystal clear — [Crimea is Ukraine](https://twitter.com/alexbward/status/1559996922470998018).

🍄 Roughly [100 russians](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1559958199700160512), the majority of whom were the leadership of the 2^nd army corps and 20 representatives of the security services of russia were killed in the HIMARS [attack on a russian military HQ](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1559584173731586050) in Lysychansk Tuesday.

🍄  We’re also getting [some footage](https://twitter.com/CasualArtyFan/status/1559893620454563842) of what’s left of a russian base in Nova Khahovka in Kherson.

🍄 russia says the IAEA [cannot visit](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1560024534308343810) the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant because “Ukraine is shelling it” which is odd because Ukraine and the UN are desperately trying to get [an IAEA mission to the power plant](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559970793060241412).

🍄  Ukraine caught a nice *LOUD* [boomer](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1560088806921015296) in Amvrosiyivka.

👉 A lot of things just become background noise in this war, [air-raid alerts](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1560052463411027973), inbound missiles, missiles shot down, missiles landed.  It’s so common it doesn’t even feel like news, until a missile hits a mall or a school or a hospital or as it did Wednesday morning, a [residential building](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1560014541848825868) in [Kharkiv](https://twitter.com/maria_avdv/status/1559992847775973379).  The death toll from the attack is [7 killed, 17 injured](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1560027013280403456).

👉 Here is a sample of russia's Wednesday’s missile strikes that didn’t kill a building full of kids but still changed lives forever.  [Zatoka](https://twitter.com/ana_alekseienko/status/1559798093255774209), [Odessa](https://twitter.com/EmineDzheppar/status/1559873586315264001), [a Kharkiv Playground](https://twitter.com/KharkivKherson/status/1559890449250353152), and a [University in Mykolaiv](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559818243996622850.html). 

🥷 russia has gone all in on the theory that bands of Ukrainian saboteurs are roaming the Crimean peninsula bringing explosions and mayhem everywhere they go.   [Facts don’t matter](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1559987929593786368), as long as [it looks like](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559905103745880067.html) they’re doing *something*.  Some security theater has been enacted on the Crimean bridge to russia as [outgoing vehicles are being searched](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559946854363811843.html) so as not to allow saboteurs to enter russia, with an added bonus of maybe slowing the exodus of residents.  Of course russia is using the attacks to justify labeling Ukraine [a state sponsor of terrorism](https://twitter.com/SamRamani2/status/1559865855890055168).

🥷 A large [explosion took place](https://twitter.com/KyivPost/status/1559851840052887553) next to the city commandant’s office in occupied Melitopol.  Reportedly russians have [blocked all exits](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559935723305943051) to the city and are strip searching everyone who goes through.

🥷  If you like all the partisan attacks in the news recently, then you’re in for a good time as Ukraine [plans to push this strategy](https://twitter.com/GuardianUS/status/1559602386179690496) to its limits.  It is [the same strategy](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1559658564863524864) that paralyzed the russian army around Kyiv, bled it with a thousand cuts until the only thing it could do was withdraw.

👉 Ukraine has 10,000+ troops being trained in Britain, and more in the US, Germany, the baltic states, and elsewhere.  The troops actually inside Ukraine have ground the russian army to a standstill and set them back on their heels.  And all of this means that Ukraine is not looking [to increase the size of its army right now](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559842473765126149).  russians on the other-hand are taking everyone they can [beg](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1559799443532255235), borrow, or [steal](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1559878504409403393.html).

👉 Members of Ukraine’s [international legion](https://twitter.com/RichRaycraft/status/1560080261831966721) are speaking out against perceived misconduct.

🛩 The destruction of the russian air defense in the south continues to pay dividends as Ukraine [flies more group sorties](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1559970818968338433) that are strafing russian positions, with a bonus downing of a russian Ka-52 helicopter on Wednesday.

👉 russia is holding “army games” that is meant to show off its weapons but so far the biggest highlights have been, a tank crew [that got lost](https://twitter.com/ConflictsW/status/1559582554105184256),  a tank crew that [crashed their tank](https://twitter.com/ConflictsW/status/1559916742272483334), and a BMP that [can’t shoot straight](https://twitter.com/pmakela1/status/1559993275477626880).

👉 Chechnya is reported to be sending [four battalions](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559805711802040320) of “volunteers” to Ukraine.  Chechnya troops usually serve in the rear lines to shoot russian deserters.

👉  russia may be [preparing for Ukraine’s Independence Day](https://twitter.com/Tsihanouskaya/status/1559786535121305600) on the 24^th by building up a [huge missile stockpile](https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1559818195372064773) in Belarus.

🇩🇪 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz [stated](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1559834272323833856) it’s possible to restore normal relations with russia only after the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine and the conclusion of peace “on reasonable terms”.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 18 August 2022
 

- The heavy attrition of Russian Main Battle Tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia's failure to fit and properly employ adequate Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA). Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank. This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the First Chechen War in 1994.

- It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely. These deficiencies probably contribute to the widespread incidents of turret ejection, which are well documented in eye-witness videos from Ukraine.

- The war has seen numerous failures by Russian commanders to enforce low-level battle discipline - such as the use of ERA. The cumulative effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia's forces.

Day 176 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today there was shelling again, at 10pm, but there’s no info about what was shelled yet. The usual missile strike is yet to happen today, yesterday it did happen very late, at 4:30am, and today it could happen at that same time. Hopefully it doesn’t happen, but it probably will.

Yesterday there was not one, but two missile strikes, first one at 9:25pm, which destroyed the *first*, and then the second missile strike, in which they fired 8 missiles, destroyed a *second* dormitory. They killed 17 people, including a 13 year old boy and some elderly people. The scumbags over at the Russian MOD admitted that they destroyed 2 dormitories, but said that they killed “over 90 militants” in those strikes. 

That is a complete fucking bullshit, we know exactly who was killed, and they weren’t soldiers. Those fuckers also named another dormitory where they are saying “AFU is stationed, with a lot of military vehicles around”. Which is yet another lie, but they just pained a target on that building, I hope that if there are any people in there they will see it and leave immediately.

All those explosions in Russian controlled territory are so nice to see, they can’t feel as if they can kill our people and suffer no consequences. Crimean bridge being destroyed would be the best thing. That would completely shatter any pride Russians still have left, but they will probably come up with another excuse, like “we didn’t need that bridge anyway, it was old and was going to be dismantled soon”. 

What I find extremely funny after reading Russian comments in their telegram channels about their ammo dumps and bases being destroyed on Russian controlled/occupied territory is that they are just extremely delusional. They are seriously complaining about “there not being any retaliatory strikes for hitting their territory”. You literally destroyed **two dormitories** full of civilians in the morning, and now you are complaining about your military bases being destroyed later in the day? This is just fucked up.

1. Neutralize the RF Airforce. 

2. Draw more men from the Donbas into garrison duty in Crimea. 

I've got this weird hunch that refuses to go away which screams at me the primary target is Melitipol. It's the key to the entire Russian southern occupation. And the supply situation into Crimea is across a vulnerable jugular: The Fucking Bridge. The capture of Melitipol would mean the eventual liberation of all of Crimea and every city west of Melitipol. It's got a massive grass-roots partisan movement, and a small garrison deep behind enemy lines. A blitzkrieg south from Zaporizhzhia, through Vasiylvika, would mean a path straight south to Melitipol. Take the city, hit The Bridge, and that's checkmate.

“Since 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations.”

And this seems to be the case with the “Special Military Operation” with neither side officially issuing a “Declaration of War”. So no War has been declared where does that leave the various Geneva Conventions and Protocols?

“The Geneva Conventions extensively define the basic rights of wartime prisoners (civilians and military personnel), established protections for the wounded and sick, and provided protections for the civilians in and around a war-zone.”

It has been widely reported that Russia has systematically committed “war crimes” against civilians and POWs. They clearly have the view that no war exists and so the Geneva Conventions don’t apply.

The question of declaring Russia a Terrorist State (which also means a State that sponsors Terrorism) has been discussed here and many other threads and forums. It seems that any Nation can, with some cause, declare another as being a Terrorist State. International practice over the past twenty years or so seems to give the declaring State the right to pursue “terrorists” no matter where they are and however they like.

So perhaps Russia should be condemned as a Terrorist State and their various functionaries, no matter where they are, be pursued and removed. Maybe start with Fox News and it’s many “entertaining” mouthpieces, now there’s a thought.",False,1660823837.0,t3_wr9g06,t3_wr9g06,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

This is clearly an issue that's having a direct impact on the ability of the soldiers in this unit to effectively fight off the Russian invasion. 

If Ukraine will integrate with EU and NATO in the future, it is essential they display accountability and look to differentiate themselves from Russia as much as possible. Letting a former organised criminal run army units in an irresponsible, dangerous and thuggish way while sending soldiers on suicide missions does not help Ukraine in any way. 

I really hope they show the kind of accountability needed to prove they are changing old corrupt and broken practices to ensure such people don't end up in positions of authority in their army. Ukraine's saving grace will be in differentiating themselves as much as possible from the Russian MO. This is a chance to do that

Edit: lest I be accused of being a pro-RuZZian troll (I think my history should be pretty clear on that front), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/wr0q7d/kyiv_independent_international_legion_fighters/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is a thread from r/Ukraine discussing the same issue. It appears that even Ukrainians working with soldiers who have come across this unit are confirming the accounts in that article.

This is an important issue to _Ukrainians_ that they want to see addressed. This is something directly affecting the ability of Ukrainians to survive. When a Polish organised criminal who should not be able to serve in higher posts sends soldiers on suicide missions, tries to steal from his own soldiers and harasses female medics, it is hurting Ukrainians.

This is a fantastic piece. I love everything about it, but especially the few paragraphs which includes insight into Putin and Simonyan.

The latter had long vexed me in that she is currently supporting/defending the same kind of atrocities her family had fled from. It seemed especially galling that she is not only unwilling to spare others from the terror her own kind had faced, but is even willing to support it at the forefront in media. It's a 'Fuck you, got mine' mentally, except there isn't even any benefit of money involved. If anything, the war is probably a disaster on her finances and she has already gotten sanctioned due to her support.

Here is how she reacts when directly confronted with those atrocities:
>In early March, with the station already closed, Venediktov met with Margarita Simonyan, the head of RT. He calls her Margo, and the two are friends. Venediktov had brought photos of Ukrainian children killed in the war. ""I said: 'Margo, they're kids like yours.' I thought she would tell me something about collateral damage now. But her eyes glazed over, and she said: 'The Nazis bombed themselves. This is staged.'"" Venediktov says: ""She's not pretending. She really believes it."" He broke off contact.

>Venediktov views Simonyan's lack of empathy for Ukraine's children as reflective of Russian society writ large. ""Eleven million Russian families have close relatives in Ukraine. That means there are 40 million people who have mother, father, brother, sister or grandchildren there. And then such support for the war. How can that be?"" He says the propaganda alone isn't enough to explain it. ""There's something bad that runs deep in people.

Maybe someone should try to explain to those of us who are thinking straight, what exactly would be the point of a Ukrainian ""provocation""?   Are they trying to provoke Russia into retreating?  It's quite obvious to anyone with two functioning neurons that Ukraine has no need whatsoever to ""provoke"" Russia into conflict.  Russia is doing that all by themselves. 

Further, since Ukraine's stated desire is to reclaim its territory, surely they do not want to reclaim a radioactive hazard. 

I suspect this ""provocation' is designed to give Russia the excuse to either call in peacekeepers (to freeze the lines of conflict), withdraw from the area, or use tactical radiological weapons. 

I suspect Ukraine's best strategy would be to have forces stand back in the region and go all out against Kherson or Crimea while Russia's focussed on its false false-flag, and really rub their nose in it.

'Stop resisting or nukes!', like 'Remove sanctions or nukes!', is ridiculous as policy but can be obfuscated with enough bullshit rhetoric to make it seem an alarming possibility we should avoid by doing whatever Russia wants.

> ... but pretending that nuclear escalation could and would never happen under any circumstances is...

...not something that is happening.

Because the amount of material in the jet is minimal, 'reactive armors' were invented.  Once inside the tank the extreme heat of the metal or plasma is enough to burn all the oxygen inside the tank.

The most effective reactive armors work by putting two metal plates around a birthday cake sized explosive charge.  When an anti tank missile approaches the explosive goes off and the outer metal plate explodes towards the missile.  This accomplishes two things (1) it triggers premature detonation of the missile's warhead; and (2) it causes the missile to expend its very limited super heated jet of material on the outer metal plate which is exploding towards the missile.  (Of course modern ATGMs like the Javeline and NLAW have two stage warheads, the first stage fires to trigger reactive armor, the second stage hits the tank).

The reactive armor is the metal boxes you see on the exterior of modern tanks.  The boxes are for anti-tank missiles.  The main armor is for tank rounds, which are super dense metalic darts fired from the main cannon, and artillery.",1660808991.0,1660808775.0,t3_wr9g06,t1_ikrg9gx,,2,27,0,27,0,0,

The threat from this plant is not prompt critical nuclear explosion, but release of radioactive material. That can happen if the plant is functioning or not, mostly likely from breaking of fuel in the spent fuel pools, or dry casks. I am unsure of dry casks storage situation at this plant.

Edit:
There's a good bit of hope. Dry casks are the only things outside, and while they won't stand a direct hit, they're built sturdily. Cracking multiples will be hard, and the fuel inside those has had years to decay the greater majority of the truly awful shit away. A meltdown from that is all but impossible. (As in I can't figure out how to make that shit melt under the worst scenario)

The spent fuel pool is a bit worse off. It's got one giant protective layer of concrete in the main buildings, the fuel is hotter, and if you break one, you've probably broken a lot. And breaking the concrete to get a shell in would remove their ability to use the emergency ventilation system, as it assumes the containmemt is still whole.

I don't know how many shells it'd take to bust it open, but I'd say probably more than one 120 mil.shot. 

Likelyhood of meltdown is still poor, as the spent fuel is literally kept in a 25 ft deep pool of water.

>Litvinovich has conducted focus groups to investigate what is going on in the minds of Russians who support the ""special military operation."" She speaks of an almost religious conviction of the correctness of the war. ""You can't convince them with rational arguments. They claim we didn't start the war – because we're the good guys. We don't kill peaceful citizens – because we're the good guys. We don't destroy cities – because we're the good guys. When you ask people about Bucha and Mariupol, they say: Our soldiers aren't capable of doing that.""

>""People can't accept the idea that we're the bad guys. It would destroy their world, their country, their view of everything that has happened in the past 30 years,"" Litvinovich says. She compares it to the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time, as a teenager, she had just joined Komsomol, the communist youth league. ""It was a shock when everything that had been good was suddenly considered to be bad. There was constant talk of Stalin and his repressions.""

Honestly, this is something that isn't difficult to see either. You can basically see it any time a war happens.

For most people, the idea that they're 'the bad guys' is unbearable so the negative actions of their country must be justified somehow and they must also shut down any news that can't be easily justified, e.g. murdering children.",False,1660826612.0,t3_wr9g06,t1_ikrpgsa,,3,17,0,17,0,0,

With that said, there were reports early into the war of racism against Indian and African Nationals who were trying to flee Ukraine.  
Those reports had a fair bit of truth in them, but also in several cases lacked important context that could explain at least some of the observed poor treatment.  
For example there were some reports indicating that SOME nationals from African nations as well as from India, attempted to force their way through the evacuation lines. This needless to say caused a fair bit of anger and resentment from Ukrainians,  including of course the Ukrainian authorities handling the evacuation process, and this may explain some of the poor treatment that Indian and African nationals received during those days. **I'm sure there was also a fair bit of racism in the mix of that as well, racism is very much present in pretty much every country out there, and in times of war, with chaos, those prejudices tend to become a lot more prevalent.** 

There was also reports of Indian students that were not allowed to enter Poland, while Ukrainians and European Union citizens were allowed to with very little issue. Obviously EU citizens were allowed without any issues because they have the right to enter Poland anytime they want. Ukrainian citizens were allowed easily because the Polish government pretty much opened their borders for Ukrainian citizens. The same was not true to other foreign nationals, so that may explain why some of them found it harder to get in. I know of a few cases of Brazilians who were stucked on the border, and at least in their cases the Brazilian government had to basically strike a deal with the Polish government to repatriate those people. I'm guessing that the same happened for the Indians students that were stucked on the border during those early days.   


Basically what i'm saying is that the issues in the border with Poland was probably a result of Poland being adamantly against accepting any refugee that wasn't a Ukrainian citizen, therefore those people needed the help of their home country to get them out of there.",False,1660802466.0,t3_wr9g06,t1_ikrd79r,,3,11,0,11,0,0,

It may decay multiple times before coming stable.

Not quite. They are absolutely used to manage gas prices and end up being at a much lower percentage after the winter than before.

> This winter is going to be incredibly tough for us in Europe. Our energy bills are going to be 5-10x what they have been in recent years.

That's already the case right now. The question is when the price crunch comes. Right now the price is high because Russia has reduced supplies while the reserves need to fill up, not because of actual usage. If the combination of the current gas reserves plus the LNG deliveries come out to a point where Europe can survive without Russia, the price will plummet. 

>  Its going to be a brutal winter economically and a cold one for many Europeans who won't be able to afford to heat their homes.

I really think you're overstating the situation. A lot of the ""brutality"" is happening right now already since Russia has reduced supply by about 75% and we're filling up the reserves under those conditions. Consumers will helped by governments and it will mostly be industry that will be told to cut back if it comes down to a crunch. As a whole however, Europe has been more successful than anticipated to find alternative gas supplies, either through using existing pipelines better (such as from Norway and Algeria), or by getting more LNG than previously thought possible.

So your statements about ""brutality"" are frankly alarmist and have no basis in fact.

If you frighten a crowd of Americans they call for guns. Most people on this reddit were trying to get more arms to Ukraine.  They were direct about saying people should feel a hot pepper in the bum ""just"" because of the war crimes.  

Causing a stampede in a crowded theater by shouting ""fire"" is a wrong thing to do because people get trampled.  If you were shouting ""stampede now!"", arguing for stampede, and throwing people toward the door then you probably do not see much adverse consequence.  

I have heard it said that shouting ""fire"" is a good idea if you are getting raped.  It brings a bunch of attention that the attacker does not want.  Unfortunately people are more likely to respond to ""fire"" than they are to ""help"" or ""rape"".  It is sad if true and I would rather not test it.  

Suppose there really is a fire.  It is not even dishonest.  ""Look! An arsonist is burning the balcony"".  Sure, the arsonist might be burning the building because of a psychotic desire to see people rush out.

Edit: I did an online search [this source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1980.tb00729.x) says it is better to scream ""help rape"".",1660867090.0,1660866121.0,t3_wr9g06,t1_ikuvndy,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
