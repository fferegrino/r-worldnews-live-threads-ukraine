Russian officials have been subject to ""increasingly severe foreign travel restrictions"" since the invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. 

Some officials likely have even had to forfeit their passports to Russia's FSB, the Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence update. 

Those closest to the centre of power are under more severe restrictions, with Kremlin officials banned from all international leisure travel. 

""The measures are likely designed to prevent the flight or defection of increasingly disaffected officials,"" the MoD said. 

Numerous reports have emerged of tensions within the Kremlin and discontent among officials about how the war in Ukraine is being managed. 

The MoD said travel restrictions were originally tightened after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but the measures have been widened further. 

""There is a realistic possibility that as the securitisation of the Russian state continues, travel restrictions will be tightened for an increasing number of public sector employees,"" the update added.

Day 385 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was definitely not a quiet day here, especially in my district of the city. They fired a couple of missiles from Belgorod around 10:15am, but I’m pretty sure only one of them made it to Kharkiv, and that one missile landed about 550-600m away from me, thankfully our windows didn’t break this time because there was no direct line of sight to the explosion. We barely even felt the shockwave, but it was extremely loud, this was definitely the loudest explosion we heard in the last 6-9 months, because usually my district doesn’t get targeted much by missiles, as there are literally no military targets anywhere nearby. 

I would say that this was the closest “big” missile explosion that we personally experienced so far in this war. When Kharkiv was still being shelled every day there was that one Grad rocket (about 20kg of explosives) that hit the roof of our apartment building, and it hit pretty much directly above our flat, so we were only about 7-10 meters away from the explosion that time, but we were never hit with anything big. The explosion from today was probably just as loud, if not louder, than when we were hit directly. Well, I guess it’s not really that surprising, as the S-300 missile has about 7 times more payload than the Grad rocket.

And the place that they were most likely targeting was extremely stupid, but that’s nothing unusual by now. What do Russians hate the most? Educational institutions, of course, so this time they decided to hit a special school for deaf children. Brilliant targeting by Russians, they really showed those deaf children who’s the boss. Well, not really, they actually missed by about 10-20 meters, and hit the road between the school and an apartment building. There were no casualties, and all that they managed to destroy were some civilian cars. One of them was destroyed by a manhole cover that was launched by the explosion, it almost cut the car in half as it landed on the front window. If there was anybody in the driver’s seat they would have died, thankfully it was empty at the time.",False,1678922300.0,t3_11rlimh,t3_11rlimh,,0,166,0,166,0,0,

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said its staff has held productive talks and made ""very good progress"" with Ukrainian officials today, concerning a set of policies that could underpin a new lending programme for the war-torn country. 

Ukrainian officials have said they hope to agree a $15bn (£12.5bn) multi-year programme with the IMF. 

This would be the IMF's biggest loan to a country involved in an active conflict. 

The seven-day meeting of staff and officials in Warsaw came as a result of the country's request for a fund-supported programme.

Vahram Stepanyan, the IMF representative to Ukraine, said discussions should be concluded in the ""coming days"". 

Once terms of a loan are agreed upon, IMF staff will write a recommendation to the executive board to endorse the country’s policy intentions and offer financing.

What is an IMF loan and how will it help Ukraine?

A loan from the IMF aims to help member countries tackle payments problems, stabilise their economies, and restore sustainable economic growth. 

It is typically part of a 'crisis resolution' for countries that are in need of support.

The loan allows recipient countries some breathing room to adjust economic policies and pave the way for sustainable growth.

Experts have said Russia managed to increase the amount of territory it controls in Ukraine by less than 0.04% in February. 

In the same month it launched its long-awaited new offensive, Russia managed to capture just around 90.3 square miles of territory, analysts from the Institute for the Study of War told Insider.

This increase is similar to what was reported by tracking group War Mapper, which said there had been a 0.01% increase. 

A senior US diplomat was scathing about Russia's progress and said: ""Russia has declared that it is launching a new offensive. Well, if this is it, it is very pathetic.""

Despite only gaining a small amount of territory, Moscow appears to have lost a large amount of men and equipment. 

Around 1,200 soldiers were killed in one day of fighting in Bakhmut, US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley told Politico in late February. 

In the same month, the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated Russia had lost half its main battle tanks since the invasion began. 

The British Ministry of Defence also reported this week that Russia is suffering from severe ammunition shortages.

By Stuart Ramsay, chief correspondent

Through the night and all day, the sound of outgoing fire has reverberated through towns and cities we travelled through nearer to the frontline in Bakhmut. 

The dull thud of outgoing artillery is a constant, incoming fire less frequent when we were there.

We met Artem, a young commander at a secret base where he and his team were watching real time picture of the battle for Bakhmut.

He showed me the Russian positions that are now surrounding three sides of Bakhmut and explained that Ukrainian forces themselves are now attempting to out flank the Russians by attacking those positions from the rear.

""The Russian tactic at the moment is to attack everything, everywhere,"" he said, adding that the battles are fierce, and that every time the Ukrainians kill or clear out a Russian unit, another wave of men are sent in the next day and the whole process starts again.

""That's how they try to push; they have unlimited manpower, they just push, push, push, no matter the cost.

""They don't care about their men, they just don't care,"" he told me.

Ukraine is determined to defend Bakhmut, and their military says they are wearing the Russian forces down. 

As each day passes the invading army is losing considerably more men and equipment than they are, although the losses on both sides are awful.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 March 2023  


* Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian public officials and workers have been subject to increasingly severe foreign travel restrictions. Some officials have likely had to forfeit their passports to the Federal Security Service.  

* Employees closer to the centre of power face more severe restrictions; Kremlin officials are banned from all international leisure travel.  

* This is a widening of existing measures which date from the Soviet era. Travel restrictions were tightened after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.  

* The measures are likely designed to prevent the flight or defection of increasingly disaffected officials.  

* There is a realistic possibility that as the securitisation of the Russian state continues, travel restrictions will be tightened for an increasing number of public sector employees.

Now, he only said that if were to leave—and that is up to Zelensky—that withdrawing would not indicate that Ukraine was losing. (*I’m summarizing here.*)

General Austin also said he told Shoigu that the US would continue to fly “wherever international law allows,” meaning they don’t consider what Russia claims to be theirs alone as restricting, and putting on notice that USA will be back. 

General Milley said that given the depths where the drone was downed, it would’ve broken up, will be difficult to retrieve, and won’t have much value in comparison.  He repeated that it was US property and there’s allies in the region.^1  (Not sure if implying that allies would/could prevent retrieval?)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran–U.S._RQ-170_incident




They did it by hacking the controls and piloting it themselves to where they brought it down safely inside their territory. This was a much more advanced drone than the one that was downed yesterday, and Iran captured it in perfect working order. 



I don’t doubt that the US military was not very pleased, but that is the reality of putting things out in to the real world. That was 12 years ago. The specific bug that allowed Iran to commandeer that drone has been fixed, they say, but there is no way of knowing that every potential weakness has been addressed. I don’t know that there is a solution to getting rammed by a MiG.



Iran says that they successfully reverse-engineered the Sentinel, and maybe they did, but they certainly aren’t manufacturing Sentinel copies in any sort of numbers, the drones that they do make a lot of are flying lawnmowers that use 1970s technology.



I have no doubt that Russia would love to put pictures of drone pieces on television and are desperately trying to scoop up every part that they can, but I’m extremely skeptical that there is anything besides propaganda points to be gained. They have had 12 years with everything that there is to know from capturing a more advanced drone, and that doesn’t seem to have helped them. 



What they are doing is pissing off Turkey. The Black Sea is a Turkish lake (as far as Turkey is concerned). If anybody gets to fuck with things flying over the Black Sea? It’s Turkey, and nobody else. Russia really doesn’t want the Bosphorus closed to commercial traffic heading to or from Russia. Turkey could, with a wave of the hand, re-classify Russia as a “belligerent” and under the Montreux Convention block all trade. That would be a major escalation, obviously, but it’s out there as something that could happen.

However Ukraine will not be able to continue with dispersed operations after receiving Western jets.  There will be too few trained ground crew and spare equipment to supply many bases.  This is a major problem because Russia still has ballistic missiles that can strike fixed positions, and which Ukraine cannot intercept.

That is where Patriot comes in.  New block Patriot interceptors have excellent ballistic missile defense capabilities.

I am extremely skeptical that the C&C links were unencrypted, as I know for a fact that there are requirements that they be secure.  The only way it's possible that they managed to hijack that link is if it was an early prototype under evaluation.
  
What is far more likely is that they got lucky with a more basic EW attack which forced the drone into a failsafe mode.  Typically there is a cascading series of failsafes for these things - the drone will loiter until comms come back, and automatically attempt to return to base if that takes too long.  If the fuel is too low to return to base, it will attempt a soft landing somewhere else.  You obviously can't really let it just run out of fuel and crash into hostile territory because it could hit something noteworthy and be seen as an act of war (also, you don't want to kill civilians).  
  
What most likely happened is that the drone was already near the edge of its fuel limit, lost comms, kicked into a ""loiter for 5 minutes"" mode, during which time it ran through enough fuel that it didn't have enough to return home.  A stupid bug, for sure but far more plausible than encrypted comms being hijacked exactly once.

Right now most of the US aid to Ukraine is being done via two mechanisms. Presidential drawdown authority and ukraine security assistance initiative. 

Presidential drawdown authority allows the president to give away X amount of existing US stuff to an ally. X is the amount authorized by congress. Any aid given using it must be priced against the budget congress has given at replacement price. And this is really important because it really affects what aid the Biden admin has given. If the US sends a Bradley from the 90s to Ukraine it 'costs' them the price of a brand new 2023 Bradley from their aid budget. Could the Biden admin send Ukraine 50 F-16s, yes, and that would drain their entire drawdown budget. No more Himars missiles, no more artillery shells. Biden can't give away more than Congress authorizes. Now, as to why congress hasn't authorized more for the drawdown, that's a damn good question that I have written to my rep and senators about. I don't have the answer, except that it runs up the budget deficit and that gets into the whole fight about the debt ceiling. Should it, I don't think so, but that is how the current laws work. 

The other main aid mechanism is the USAI, ukraine security assistance initiative, a bunch of vouchers that Ukraine can use to buy stuff from US defense contractors. Ukraine sends the order to Lockhead, the US pays the bill, up to the amount allocated in the fund. Defense contractors don't make stuff a customer hasn't ordered, so when Ukraine uses this it is for new things that are produced for that order. These take time to produce and, again, the funding isn't unlimited so Ukraine has prioritized high need systems that can be produced quickly and don't use up all the money. So this doesn't help Ukraine get existing stuff we've got sitting around. 

People ask the question, 'Why doesn't the US...' and try to treat the US as one person. Or maybe a unified group of people. But it isn't. And the people that control what happens to old equipment isn't the Biden administration, it's congress. And congress is 535 different people who have wildly different agendas and priorities.",1678947567.0,1678930313.0,t3_11rlimh,t1_jcdao66,,1,43,0,43,0,0,

>📎Berhivka – Rozdolivka:  
>  
>✏In the Khromov - Bohdanivka section, the defenders continue to hold on heroically, preventing the aggressor from closing the encirclement ring.  
>  
>✏On the section Orihovo Vasilivka - Zeleznianske - Vasyukivka (towards Slavyansk), the Russians managed to capture Zeleznianske, so their bridgehead on the road towards Slavyansk continues to expand. We remind you that about a couple of days ago, they achieved a slight victory and drove a small wedge into the Ukrainian defense line. We hope that with the help of artillery and counterattacks, this driven wedge will be eliminated. On the other hand, the Russians not only maintained, but also expanded the territory under their control. A more intense movement of the aggressor is expected in the development of his success towards Slavyansk.  
>  
>✏Vasyukivka - Rozdolivka - Vesele (towards Syversk) the aggressor continues to fail to advance. It cannot be ruled out that here the occupiers are only maintaining the tension, and they hope to solve the Syversk issue by attacking together towards Slavyansk.  
>  
>📎The situation in the city continues to deteriorate. The Russians push into the territory of the metalworking factory and the surrounding houses, thereby creating a bridgehead on the western bank of the Bakhmutovka River. However, the defenders in the southern part of Bakhmut managed to hold out.  
>  
>📎Heavy fighting continues south of Khasiv Yar - Ivanivsk. The Russians announce that they managed to advance to Ivanivske, but this is more like disinformation to multiply the effect of tactical success achieved in other sections of the sector.

The supply routes in and out are still open and the defensive ground around them is very solid so it’s unlikely Russia will be able to encircle the city in the very near future. The fear of Russia directly capturing or encircling Bakhmut seems to rapidlybe diminishing. 

The new fear is that Ukraine’s losses in holding Bakhmut may be (relatively) impacting them more than Russia’s losses. Various “experts” have tried to give their opinions but ultimately no one outside Ukraine’s war room really knows what the Ukrainian losses are and both sides are making projections about future strength on very limited data. Things are highly uncertain so taking anyone’s word that “this is right or wrong” should be avoided regardless of if it’s a random Milblogger or a four star general from a country that’s not directly fighting.

The Venturi effect also happens to ships if they get too close.  The air is a fluid.  If two objects are close enough the pressure between will drop and they slam together.  

Compounding problems occur when you have an agile fighter designed to easily change pitch.  Extra pressure drop over the nose/cockpit would tilt the plain.  That tilt change should cause a sudden climb same as using the elevator on the tail.  Then the su-27's tail gets sucked up as the nose clears and the back enters the stream.  

Approaching from behind and below the drone the nose and cockpit can avoid impact but still be close enough for one of the vertical stabilizers to hit the propellor when the jet rises suddenly.

>I'll show you the other side of Bakhmut's defense.

>On 12.03, a T-90M ""Breakthrough"" tank was discovered in the eastern part of Zabakhmutka. It's an expensive thing, the most stock version starts at $2.5 million.

>After the discovery, artillery fire was launched, but due to the place of parking behind the house (see video) and the terrible shell hunger of ALL artillery systems defending this outfit, the target was not hit. The closest gap is in the roof of the house.

>But he managed to stall the tank, and the crew took cover in the nearest building. The shooting was over, see the background above.

>The information was sent up on command. In the evening, the people of God (hereinafter referred to as LB) came to me with the task of hitting this tank with some overseas wunderwaffe (hereinafter referred to as WFZ) ....

>And the whole thing goes to shit in the best traditions of the Soviet system.

>13.03 Interaction with the LB is established, a plan of destruction is worked out. But! In the afternoon, the LBs say that their cabinet leadership has forbidden the use of high explosive weapons on a standing tank! Because... It's inappropriate, you fucking morons, only on targets that are being targeted. The argumentation is expensive!

>Tank - 2.5 million dollars < VFZ - unknown cost. But using the math of the 5th clan, we prove that it is more expensive than 2.5 million dollars.

>14.03 The tank moved a block north. The LBs close the art of the senior officer on us. We try to work it out - two shells and we're done. Technical malfunction. 3 hours ago, the T-90M ""Breakthrough"" safely left in an unknown direction.

>I think it will return at night (or later, but it will definitely return) and will definitely kill someone. And this is just the tip of the existing cunt! The enemy is moving unimpeded in the captured areas, at a distance of 1-3 km from the front line (hereinafter - the CL)!

>Passenger cars, jeeps, gazelles, URALs, Tigers, infantry fighting vehicles and tanks. Even the bastardized foresters (you may have already seen a video on DeepState of one of them accidentally getting hit by 82mm on the streets of Zabahmutka). BM-21 Grad arrived at a distance of 3.6 km to the LBZ (fortunately, they managed to drive it away and did not allow them to make a volley). Fuck, I'm no longer happy about the damage, but just because the enemy was scared.

>There is a catastrophic lack of ammunition. The consumption of 5-7 shots per target, and this is in a ""fruitful year"". We know 75% of the enemy's main firing positions, command posts at the battalion company level, but they are sitting idle!

>The guns are active only in the areas where there are breakthroughs and assault. They are fucking tired of promising improvements, because everyone who has a mouth promises them. The first time I heard about this was on February 18, from Mariana Bezugla at the Batu KSP: ""A week and the shells of the main calibers will be at the firing positions"" (c).

>On the calendar, 14.03.......This is for you to counteract the information you get from ""experts"" and ""true news"" and to expand the spectrum of your view of the universe! And of course the proofs are attached.

>DO NOT CONSIDER THIS POST AS A CALL FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF UNITS FROM BAKHMUT!!! WE WILL FULFILL OUR DUTY TO THE END, WHATEVER IT MAY BE!

He's careful to clarify that he isn't trying to influence the military's decision on whether to withdraw, but to call that situation ""stable"" requires ignoring this account and lots of other assessments consistent with it.

Take, for example, [one of the many interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMgsg9vbYxY) the military analyst Michael Kofman has done after his visit to Bakhmut last week, where he expounds on a number of serious issues with Bakhmut's current status:

- The battles going on all over Ukraine differ greatly from one another. The character of the fight for Bakhmut is quite different from the fight around Vuhledar, and both are themselves different from the fights around Avdiivka and Vuhledar. Knowing one battle means exactly that, you know one battle.

- The biggest problem facing Ukraine right now isn't equipment, but force quality. Ukraine has lost most of its best trained troops and it hasn't done a great job with training replacements, and Western training has been quite small with mixed reviews according to Ukrainian troops. Kofman claims that most Ukrainian troops are mobilized personnel who have no previous military experience at this point.

- Kofman once again listed what he sees as Ukraine's greatest needs in order: artillery ammunition and the replacement of artillery barrels, air defense munitions/platforms, and armored fighting vehicles most importantly IFVs and APCs. Ukraine has a lot of manpower, but it needs more protected mobility to be able to conduct offensives. He also noted the need for more drones/ISR as well as communications equipment for Ukraine.

- When he was in Bakhmut he saw a reinforcing tank platoon that was composed entirely of T-80s that were captured in Izyum from the 1st Tank Guards army. He also noted that the problem for Ukraine is that it doesn't have enough replacement parts to keep running all of the Russian vehicles its captured.

- Once again reemphasized that providing Western planes will take a long time for their effects to be felt and their effects won't be worthwhile compared with their cost. There's a limited amount of funding available for Ukraine and providing planes will consume a lot of those funds with no effects during the upcoming decisive period of the war.

- Ukraine still has a positive casualty ratio against Russia around Bakhmut, but the ratio is worse now than its been previously. It's a fight that doesn't play to Ukraine's strengths.

- Kofman thinks the decisive period of the war will be in Spring-Summer of this year. There is the possibility that this offensive will have the effect of altering the future trajectory of the conflict, especially if Ukraine is able to sever the Russian GLOC between Crimea and the Donbas. Kofman thinks that whatever happens at Bakhmut is unlikely to be important longterm, but Ukrainian offensive could have a major impact on Russia's ability to sustain the war and potentially even cause a breakdown of cohesion like what happened during Kharkiv (though he's caveats this as being less likely). This doesn't mean the war would be close to being over though, Russia is really the one who decides when the war ends.

Also consider Russia is starting to gain ground across almost the whole front (aside from Southern).  Strange that they're gaining it now, during mud season, instead of winter which is better conditions.

At the same time not every MLRS is quite up to par with the HIMARS.

USA does not do that sort of thing.  Assuming a war remains conventional, the initial focus would be Russian ships and submarines.  Then occupation of ports though some might just be blockaded.  There would be early attempts to destroy Russia's ability to target the United States and Allies.  That makes it hard to avoid escalating.  The bombers would be target saturated.  There would not really be any assets available to divert to the Donbas.  

All aid to Ukraine would abruptly stop.  Hard to be certain but the Pentagon would probably pressure Kyiv to reduce frontline forces to minimal levels and slowly retreat.  Instead, the hope would be for Ukraine to link up with Estonia.  Ukrainian armies moving north could pressure Belarus to step out of their alliance with Moscow.  A link up between Estonia and Georgia cuts the Donbas off completely.  There is no reason for NATO to care about it.  Romania might clear Transniestra and Turkey might tear up Russian positions along the Black Sea.

This was fuelled by several atrocities in the years before independence. So it was decided that there should be a Muslim majority (Pakistan) and a Hindu majority India. But on paper it was easy to do, in reality the communities where geographically entertained and several princely state that had some autonomy under the British (for example Hyderabad, Kashmir) were ruled by rulers of different faith than the majority population.
The British drew an artificial border line. When partition came , all hell broke lose and hundreds of thousands were massacred, driven out of their villages or attacked while en route to their new countries. 
The ruler of Kashmir which was mostly Muslim was Hindu and decided to join India. Pakistan answered this by arming tribal militias who then invaded Kashmir. 
This was the first Indo Pakistani war. Since then two others followed. Hostilities continue to this day with ongoing shelling. 4 years ago, an Indian jet was downed and India bombed a meadow in Pakistan.
