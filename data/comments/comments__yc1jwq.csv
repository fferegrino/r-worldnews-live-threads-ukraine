Day 243 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was also quiet, but a bit less so than yesterday. There were no missile strikes, but we had 3 air raid alerts throughout the day, which is actually somehow better than not hearing one during the day. When they do happen we know what to expect, but if it’s completely quiet we don’t know what is going to happen next.

It’s still pretty weird that they haven’t fired any missiles or drones at us in the past 2 days. We did have a massive air raid alert that was active in the entire country, but nothing followed, they fired no missiles in our direction. There was one time where we though that they were launching missiles from Belgorod in the direction of Kharkiv, but it was just their air defense firing at something again.

It’s so funny that Russia keeps screaming about a dirty bomb that we supposedly want to detonate for some reason, but they were the ones who stole everything one would need to make a dirty bomb from Chornobyl NPP while they were running away. With how much they have been talking about it recently, they must really want to detonate one and then blame us for it.

Basically it breaks down to this.  Russians living in Russia are so far gone, that it's almost impossible to convince them of anything outside what they know from propaganda.   It's not all bad.  There is a very small percentage of people, mostly younger generation, who are aware and have their eyes opened.  But they are scared for their lives because of snitches and on some occasions, beatings.

There were few Russian soldiers who are now back in St. Petersburg  or Russia in hospital with injuries.   They told me about how they had to kill Ukrainians and now they have to live with it.  Some had truly deep regrets about it, but it still doesn't justify what they did and they understand  it.

When speaking with Ukrainians, it's like speaking with people of different mental caliber.  Educated.  Worldly. Strong.  Young and old, doesn't matter.  All unified and ready to do what is necessary for their country.  Spoke with some soldiers on the front lines too.  My heart breaks for what they have to go through every day, but their spirit is, holy shit.  Just fire.  Morale is 1000%

One dude from Bahmut told me that Russians attacking them in droves.  Usually drunk or high.  They are dropping 100s of bodies each week.  It's like a zerg they said.

One interesting bit.  When asked Ukrainians if there is ever a chance to forgive Russia or Russians and every single time the answer was a resounding ""No!""

If you can, help Ukraine and her people.  Anywhere.  Anyway.  Anyhow.

>The missile programmers are part of the Russian Armed Forces’ vast Main Computation Centre of the General Staff (GVC), and working with @the_ins_ru and @derspiegel we’ve identified the 33 military engineers involved with cruise missile attacks in Ukraine.
>
>Some of the members of this unit also took part in planning cruise missile attacks on targets in Syria and/or worked at Russia's military command centre in Damascus. Some are also recipients of various military awards, including from Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
>
>The unit within the GVC that we identified appears to consist of three teams of approximately 10 engineers each, with each team dedicated to programming flight-paths of one specific high-precision missile type, launched from the sea, land, and air.
>
>The direct commander of the missile pre-planners sub-unit appears to be Col. Igor Bagnyuk. This was established on the basis of the analysis of telephone data of eleven members of the group of engineers obtained from data sources on the Russian black data market.
>
>One of the team members, Maj. Andrey Ivanyutin, can be seen in the background of this photograph of a meeting between President Putin and Syrian President Assad held in a secure Russian compound in Damascus in January 2021.
>
>By examining telephone metadata from the members of the unit it has been possible to link phone activity to attacks on Ukraine, including the October 10th strikes on Kyiv.
>
>During the investigation we discovered Lt. Col. Bagnyuk was also an active user of the auction website Avito.ru, where he actively sells coins, even taking time to do so during the attack of Kyiv.
>
>His current offerings include a medal awarded by President Putin in 2014. Based on descriptions of other offerings of the same type of medal, it was awarded “for contribution to the organisation of the Sochi Olympics”.

Any effect it might have on soldiers pales in comparison to the existing risk of the kind of lead poisoning that occurs at very high velocity.

A dirty bomb goes off in Kherson. Russia blames Ukraine.  Russians declare evacuation in order to preserve the lives of their soldiers.  Kherson is emptied.  And Russia has an excuse to do what it's been doing all along (withdrawing from Kherson).   

It's not a military defeat.  It's just a prudent thing.  

It will be just a coincidence that just prior to the bomb going off, Russia will have removed as much personnel and value from the city. Kherson will have been made uninhabitable by sabotage of infrastructure - comms, water, heat...  It will have been made indefensible as well as uninhabitable.

Following the break-up of the USSR, the West convinced Ukraine to give up its nukes (and don't even bother with the ""they didn't have the codes"". No nuke is tamperproof given time enough, and Ukraine could easily have dismantled their existing nukes and gotten to the weapon cores, to build their own mechanism). 

&nbsp; 

However you twist and turn the legal document signed, the intentention was to make Ukraine feel they were given enough security guarantees against Russia to safely hand over their nukes. And they did.

If we do not keep delivering on those promises, Ukraine is **still** going to win in the long run. The hate for Russia in Ukraine is now universal, there is no way Russia could militarily supress them long enough to change that, without the costs to Russia breaking their state. They no longer even have the military power to even occupy the whole country. Even if the West stopped their aid. Nothing short of full nuclear annihilation of Ukraine would lead to any other result than a Ukrainian state remaining, partially of its former borders, or whole.

&nbsp;

If that state wins its war at too great a price, and abandoned by us in the west, the country has nuclear power plants, uranium mines, large scale production facilities and industrial capacity and plenty of savvy engineers and researchers. Building a nuke is not even that complex. The delivery systems are. And they already *have those*, and the know-how to expand on them. They would uparm with nukes so fast, a certain North Korean dictator would cream himself thinking about it.

Here's what they have been doing:

* Organize a massive evacuation. They are probably using civilian movement to hide/shield  military movement. I do think they are trying to retreat from Kherson in an orderly fashion.
* An army official explaining the situation <- highly unusual
* Admit difficulties <- highly unusual
* Accusing the opponent of doing something evil: this is a very common thing, but it often means they are doing it themselves. So this could mean they plan to destroy the dam and/or use a dirty bomb.
* Calling foreign Nations to inform them about the false flag operation <- highly unusual

Two possible scenarios of what this could mean:

1. Scorched earth/escalation.  Destroy Kherson and everything they leave behind. Militarily this does not make that much sense, but after all they have done so far, this wouldn't shock me..

2. They're only trying to scare the West with all the talk about dirty bombs etc. in hope of reducing Western military support.

Any other ideas what the evil fuckers are planning to do?

Edit: some sources say that the military is not leaving Kherson and that in fact they are bringing in troops. So they would be using civilian movement to hide military movement, but in the other direction.

So, in a modern thermonuclear device, you have three stages. An initial fission explosion, which kicks off a fusion reaction (known as the spark plug), which then kicks off a secondary larger fission explosion.

Now, for the longest time, the fuel used for the fusion mid-stage was tritium. Fantastically expensive, and it only has a half life of 12 years. It must be replenished constantly.

Now, the modern US arsenal, at great cost, switched to lithium-7 deuteride, which is shelf stable. It doesn't need to be replaced.

I am curious if the soviets made the same switch before the fall of the USSR. Because if they didn't, I guarantee you the Russian oligarchy did not spend the money it would have taken to make that switch.

If they didn't, then two and a half half-life cycles for tritium have passed. And seeing how poorly maintained the rest of their military equipment has been, I doubt they have been replenishing the tritium, at least in their land-based ICBMs. Their submarines have probably kept their nukes up with the times, but that is speculation on my part.

Now, if 2.5 half-life cycles have passed, the tritium in their bombs will be \~80% helium at this point. The initial fission explosion would detonate, but the fusion reaction would fizzle out. That means the secondary larger fission reaction wouldn't happen. All of that radioactive material would just become unreacted ejecta, leaving you with... a dirty bomb.

I seriously suspect the vast majority of their land-based ICBMs have been reduced from thermonuclear warheads to dirty bombs due to tritium decay and poor upkeep.",False,1666632566.0,t3_yc1jwq,t1_itku7ag,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

`DARVO is an acronym for ""deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender"". It refers to a reaction that alleged perpetrators of wrongdoing, particularly sexual offenders, may display in response to being held accountable for their behavior.[1] Some researchers and advocates have indicated that it can be a common manipulation strategy of psychological abusers.[2][3][4] An abuser (or alleged abuser) denies the abuse ever took place, attacks the person that alleged abuse (often the victim) for attempting to hold the abuser (or alleged abuser) accountable for their actions, and claims that they are actually the victim in the situation, thus reversing what may be a reality of victim and offender.[2][4] It often involves not just ""playing the victim"" but also victim blaming.[3]`

> I'm not sure how widespread the MAGATs believe this but Russia must be paying some of these guys.

Russia definitely pays a tremendous number of English language posters, but their messages also permeate a small fringe element of the right, maybe 10% of the population.  I have a sister from Idaho Oblast that spouts all of the Kremlin's talking points, and I go back and forth between trying to engage with her and implying she's stupid/gullible.  She's early 50s and is surrounded by other Magat's too.  On some level she thinks Russia is the savior of white christiondom (christiandumb) by tormenting gays and transexuals and riding horses shirtless.  She breathlessly repeats all of Russia's fantasies over text to myself and the rest of our family, everything from the annexed territories are now Russia's forever (lol) to they were free and fair to there was genocide in E. Ukraine (lol), euromaiden too, the entire Russian fantasy list.  Oh and the Russian government is trying to keep the catholic church and illumanati from mass murdering mankind.  Even my conservative parents and other sister think she's got more than a few screws loose.  

1) Genocide in E. Ukraine.  Wikipedia says something like 8k or 10k were killed in E. Ukraine from 2014-2022, somewhere in that range, including rebel fighters.  Russia sponsored media Sputnik has had a special section calling that period genocide in E. Ukraine lol   That headline has been up there since the war started and has aged poorly, as Russia has slaughtered perhaps 50,000 or more Ukrainian civilians and at least as many allied soldiers.  The UN does not call 2014-2022 ""genocide"" of course, it's a Russian fantasy.

2) Western support behind Euromaiden.  I don't know if we can definitely rule out for sure there wasn't some western or other support behind parts of the overthrow of the government along the way.  Russia was certainly hopping mad about the whole ordeal.  Zalensky was freely and fairly elected however, by huge margins.  

3) Annexations were legitimate (lol).  This one doesn't pass the laugh test for most people.  Russia has been driving non-Russian Ukrainians out of those areas for at least a decade, and many have fled the war.  And then a referendum at gunpoint after Russia kidnapped or killed anyone who disagreed with them?  Please.  Of course Russia agreed to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity many times in the past.  

Russia posts thousands and thousands of trollposts on fringe websites, and dumbdumbs find the fringe websites and think they are very wise and privy to insider knowledge.

They've also released a “clarifying statement”

> In a letter to President Biden today, my colleagues and I advocated for the administration to continue ongoing military and economic support for Ukrainians while pursuing diplomatic support to Ukraine to ensure we are helpful partners on efforts to reach ‘a solution that is acceptable to the people of Ukraine.’ Let me be clear: we are united as Democrats in our unequivocal commitment to supporting Ukraine in their fight for their democracy and freedom in the face of the illegal and outrageous Russian invasion, and nothing in the letter advocates for a change in that support.

> “Diplomacy is an important tool that can save lives — but it is just one tool. As we also made explicitly clear in our letter and will continue to make clear, we support President Biden and his administration’s commitment to nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”

The US has a layered anti-missile defence system. Near North Korea, a number of Aegis platforms can intercept missiles with Standard Missile types but they have to be close to the launch point and launch immediately. That isn’t possible in this situation.

There are very limited options for intercepting in the mid-course, it’s hard as fuck. The US only has 44 mid-course interceptors of its own, and it’s only estimated to have a probability of intercept of less than 60%. This is a very bad option.

The terminal phase is where Ukraine would need to defend itself, which is covered again by Aegis and also THAAD. A THAAD battery costs multiple billions of dollars and has a very limited number of interceptors available, which is problematic because any ballistic missile threat is likely to separate into multiple nuclear weapons per missile, *and* carry decoys, *and* may be able to be manoeuvre to avoid being hit. Russia is infamous for overengineering even its older nuclear missile designs. Whether they work is questionable, but it’s the threat that matters.

The problem is that if Russia - or any indeed, any nuclear state - wants to nuke you, you’re getting nuked.

It may also interrupt control signals as well. By the way these ""guns"" most of the time also use those cheap consumer components for jamming.

Now.. When control signals are interrupted different drones can have different ""behaviours"" programmed to deal with it. Majority of consumer drones are programmed to gently go down and land. [Here's an example][1] of this behaviour in action. Reason being: if someone is stupid enough to fly a consumer drone around airport, military based or other sensitive areas - drone should not be actively avoiding countermeasures. I.e. security, police should be able to take those drones down relatively easily. Or you, as a manufacturer, will have hard time selling those drones. Governments may ban imports of your production and/or sue you if you have a presence in a country. There's probably laws/legal requirements for that as well.

As I mentioned some military drones may also be using same consumer radios due to costs. But they may have different ways of dealing with radio jamming/interference. They may be programmed to keep altitude and leave the area using GPS or simply turn around and fly in general direction of the launch location using compass. Or circle the area until control signal is re-established. In the linked tweet we can see a taken down military drone. Why it did not have this behaviour of ""return to base"" - I cannot tell. Maybe manufacturer cheaped out on designing software for it or something.

And finally there's all kinds of ""serious"" military drones which do not have to comply with consumer regulations. They may use wider spectrums of frequencies, use directional communication with satellites flying above them and similar to avoid jamming. In that case ""guns"" we see in the photo will not help much at all.

You can't even pump gas without power (which you need to run generators).  There's no analog way to do it.  You have to operate the machinery in the factories to make all the goods needed to run the war, much less a community.  Even if we're *just* talking about the military and what the military needs, they need a great deal of infrastructure functioning normally for production, processing, packaging, and transport.  

A section of the front can run on generators, an apartment building can run on generators, but unless everybody has their own generator, the system that supplies those areas cannot.

 >The 2020–2021 Belarusian protests were a series of mass political demonstrations and protests against the Belarusian government and President Alexander Lukashenko. The largest anti-government protests in the history of Belarus, the demonstrations began in the lead-up to and during the 2020 presidential election, in which Lukashenko sought his sixth term in office. In response to the demonstrations, a number of relatively small pro-government rallies were held. The protests intensified nationwide after the official election results were announced on the night of 9 August, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner.

Russia would quickly find themselves caged within their own borders.

From there, I don't know if there is any point actually going into Russia, or if we settle for resetting the board, minus the deployed Russian forces.


I can see the west not wanting to deal with that, and instead drawing on the treatment of the French Empire, where France's illegal holdings in other countries were seized, the 1792 borders were returned to, I think reparations were enforced, and the only notable changes weren't even about France, such as Spain's slide into irrelevance, or the shake up in alliances among the German states.

Read up on the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll. This was not even intended to be a dirty bomb but caused widespread catastrophic contamination; which persisted for 50+ years. (still can't grow food that's safe to eat there).

Then, there's intentionally-created nuclear devices (which Russia had in their arsenal in the 1970's, but likely dismantled them in the 1990's - but maybe not) - since it's a nuclear detonation, it would spread the contamination over a wide area, and could be engineered to generate very, deadly, very highly-radioactive byproducts (like Cobalt-60; or polonium-210) which would be very difficult and costly to clean up.

Finally: if a regular nuclear device detonated in close proximity to an operational nuclear power plant (or waste storage), that could potentially cause catastrophic spread of highly radioactive materials over a wide area; possibly worse than the Chornobyl fallout. (if the neutron flux from the bomb is able to trigger a chain reaction in the fuel core: the device is a few kg of highly enriched material. . . the active fuel or spent-fuel can be several hundred TONS of material.)

The first ones will be ship borne, and they’re the reason why the most recent US ships have massively excessive power plants. But there are a number of issues with these.

First, long-range ballistic missiles follow a really hilarious trajectory. They don’t skim the atmosphere. They go *really* high, potentially thousands of kilometres. So even with this alternative weapon, you can’t intercept at the mid course. Lasers just don’t shoot that far.

So these directed energy weapons are all in a class called “point defence”. Their job is to defend their own location, and a small area around them. They’re being designed essentially to defend aircraft carriers.

Unfortunately, the only thing that can hit and kill a multi-tonne missile moving at hypersonic speed at long enough range to defend a wide area is another missile.

Regardless of whatever you personally are arguing, the fact is that this is a dog whistle that is used by people who want Ukraine to surrender.  So there's no 'good faith' when you say that Ukraine needs to negotiate.

One reason, for example is that Russia has no internal legal way for them to give up the land that they annexed.  Their constitution doesn't allow it.

So how exactly can Russia negotiate when they cannot legally give up land that they stole?

  
\> What is to stop them from continuing to bomb Ukraine for forever?

Sanctions and force.  Bringing Ukraine into NATO and bringing them under the protection of NATO.

Exactly the same thing that would need to happen regardless of what they 'negotiate'.

\>  What is to stop them from building up their military again, and coming back at Ukraine, again?

Well it certainly wouldn't be a negotiated piece of paper, now would it?

It would be weapons and threats of violence.

How does a negotiation stop them from building up their military again and coming back at Ukraine again?

The only thing that can prevent that is getting Ukraine into NATO.  And that doesn't need Russia to negotiate.

\> Putin ""annexed"" those territories to provide an internal pretext for waging war on Ukraine for years and years. He needs to sign an internationally recognized treaty recognizing Ukraine's sovereign borders, including all of the Donbas and Crimea, and acknowledging that Russia has no claim there.

There are two fundamental problems with this:

1. Putin cannot sign such a treaty, because it's against their constitution to give up land.  This was an amendment to the constitution in 2020: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020\_amendments\_to\_the\_Constitution\_of\_Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Russia) 
2. Even if he did sign such a treaty, it would be void because another amendment was:  
""The Russian Constitution should take precedence over international law;""

\> Ukraine then needs security guarantees from other powerful countries who will come to their defense if/when Russia violates their agreement - because they will, as long as Putin and his ilk are in power.  


This also has a major logical flaw:

Why on earth would Ukraine and powerful countries need Russia to be involved at all in those security guarantees?

Thanks, I'll flic him a message and ask if he has any spare $$ for me. Seriously though, as you've taken the time to have a look at who I am, might as well explain my position. I hold Russia 100% responsible for the war.  If I was Ukrainian I'd 100% support fighting this war for as long as possible, and I would be trying to convince the West to keep funding it.

I'm not Ukrainian though, and I care about 3 things: how much this war will cost, who will pay to prop up the Ukrainian economy longer term & how big is the risk of nuclear escalation. These are admittedly selfish things, but they are things that people in the west like myself will vote on (like it or not)

As for my comments on Iran, well I'm old enough to know what the CIA and US foreign agencies get up to at times of war & maybe its a coincidence that anti-government protests are breaking out at a time where Iran started funding arms to Russia, or perhaps it isn't. But the US has a long history of trying to overthrow the Iranian government by funding internal  groups so really not a huge stretch to say maybe its happening this time. BTW if the CIA are covertly supporting the protests - I think its a smart move & probably a good way to force Iran to disengage from supplying Russia.

Yes. That's what the security guarantees are for.

""The Russian Constitution should take precedence over international law;""

What? The only way Russia would be involved in security guarantees is being told that the countries *guaranteeing Ukraine's freedom* will jump in and whoop his ass if he starts anything.

>NATO does not need Russia's permission for Ukraine to join NATO.

Look at how long it is taking to get Finland and Sweden into NATO. It will take even longer for Ukraine. How long do you want them to be at Russia's mercy, while they wait? They need guarantees from the day that paper is signed, not a year later.

Second, It's not just any non-NATO state under attack, it is Ukraine, which was specifically given security assurances in the Minsk agreement in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons in the 90s.   


Third, Ukraine has been caught between accession to NATO and the EU versus Russian attacks for the last 17 years, going back at least to the poisoning of the pro European presidential candidate in 2005. There's an open question on the table of what NATO's obligations are to a country on its borders who has been trying to get in the club while Russia deliberately destablizes the country to thwart their NATO membership.  


Fourth, it is widely believed that if NATO backs down following the use of tactical nukes in Ukraine that Russia will deploy the same tactic in the Baltics, which are NATO, and that Putin's endgame is ultimately to see NATO dismantled by continuing to drive wedges in the alliance.   


Fifth, outside of NATO, it is a fundamental question of how the world community will respond to the use of nuclear weapons. The world does not want the use of nukes normalized. If Russia gets away with nuking Ukraine, that will have immediate strategic repercussions across all the nuclear powers in Asia, and likely trigger a new arms race.

You are completely missing the point. The issue is that Putin is using nuclear blackmail in an attempt to force the rest of the world to let him do whatever he wants. If we cave to it now, we will under Russia's thumb for the foreseeable future. Do you *want* the world to have to bow to Putin? 

You're a perfect example of the person this poem talks about:

>First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.

>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a trade unionist.

>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.

>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

As for the CIA: Putin claims that the CIA is behind *every* uprising in the world. He doesn't believe that ordinary people can care enough about things to protest on their own. Blaming the CIA for everything is 1) a denial that people have a will and morality of their own, and 2) a denial that people could be so dissatisfied with government leadership that they would publicly protest about it. So he encourages people to blame everything on the CIA, and to create paranoia and suspicion regarding it's activities.


I agree that we were misled about Iraq, and the reasons for the invasion. But you are blaming the entire CIA for providing misleading information, when the blame lies with Bush and the warhawks in his administration who *wanted* that war. At the time, the CIA director was *also* the head of the entire intelligence community, so a single person had control of all of the intelligence information provided to Congress. That situation was ripe for an abuse of power, and **has since been rectified** by Congress, who passed legislation to reform the intelligence community in 2004.

Here's a refresher, in case you're unaware of what happened:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tenet

>According to a report by veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward in his book Plan of Attack, Tenet privately lent his personal authority to the intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in Iraq.[54] At a meeting on December 12, 2002, he assured Bush that the evidence that Iraq had WMDs amounted to a ""slam dunk case"". After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet stated that it was taken out of context. He indicated that it was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq.[55] The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led Coalition forces yielded no significant WMDs.[citation needed]

>In September 2002, the Senate Intelligence Committee met with Tenet in a closed-door session. Sen. Bob Graham requested a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq. Tenet responded by saying ""We've never done a National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq"" and resisted the request to provide one to Congress. Graham insisted ""This is the most important decision that we as members of Congress and that the people of America are likely to make in the foreseeable future. We want to have the best understanding of what it is we're about to get involved with."" Tenet refused to do a report on the military or occupation phase, but reluctantly agreed to do a NIE on the weapons of mass destruction. Graham described the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting with Tenet as ""the turning point in our attitude towards Tenet and our understanding of how the intelligence community has become so submissive to the desires of the administration. The administration wasn't using intelligence to inform their judgment; they were using intelligence as part of a public relations campaign to justify their judgment.""[56]

>Congress voted to support the Iraq war based on the NIE Tenet provided in October 2002. However, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee Report on Prewar Intelligence released on July 7, 2004, concluded that the key findings in the 2002 NIE either overstated, or were not supported by, the actual intelligence. The Senate report also found the US Intelligence Community to suffer from a ""broken corporate culture and poor management"" that resulted in a NIE which was completely wrong in almost every respect.[57]",False,1666650649.0,t3_yc1jwq,t1_itmq7hi,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

Even if we suppose that strategic missile interceptors in the US arsenal are 100% accurate, they [currently](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/usmissiledefense) have only 40-odd GMD interceptors and 200 THAAD interceptors. The THAAD number is actually an overstatement because they only have 42 launchers, and reloading takes an extremely long time because these missiles are enormous. That leaves only Aegis, which isn’t in or near Ukraine, and Patriot, with the same problem. Even if we put Patriot into Ukraine, the range is severely limited in the context of strategic missile interception and a battery contains dozens of missiles, not hundreds.

So now we’ve successfully intercepted *maybe* eighty nuclear warheads if the US’ entire strategic defence system were relocated to Ukraine. If Russia has launched a single missile, great. But if they really want you to get nuked, they can just fire more.

That’s the problem here. This isn’t a technology issue. It’s a scale issue. The Cold War produced such a stupidly large nuclear arsenal that this has become unsolvable.

In the absence of a surprise strategic nuclear strike on NATO by Russia (which we could not prevent, but which would of course be complete suicide by Russia), it takes a spiral of escalation by two nuclear powers to arrive at nuclear war, and the point I do not see discussed at all is how far we on our side should be pushing upwards on that ladder of escalation at which point.

Let’s say you’re walking outside with your family, and you see a heavily armed robber threatening an unarmed man in a back alley. Of course the morally correct thing would be to jump in try to defend the victim, but this comes at considerable risk to you and your own family, and I don’t think many people would actually take that risk - nor would they be expected to.

Of course the waters can be muddied by arguments like “if you don’t stop this armed robber now, he’ll come to your house tomorrow and try to rob you, so best to stop him right now” or “We don’t want to live in a world where armed robbers can just take anything they want, so of course it is our duty to take any risks in a situation like this” - those statements might feel good, but you and your children would surely be forgiven for not caring all that much about these constructed arguments when your own survival is on the line.

It seems to me that one underlying assumption in all discussions here is that “if we don’t stop Russia now, they’ll attack a NATO country next, so we need to pick this fight right now anyway”, but I’ve not seen a single convincing argument for this at all - it seems very much like saying “you need to stop the back-alley robber before he comes to your house tomorrow”, ignoring completely the fact that the robber pounced on an opportunity now where he did not expect significant push-back but would be extremely unlikely to attempt the same thing in a context where red lines (such as a security system and potentially a well-armed home owner) and risks were clear ex ante; this however is precisely what NATO is - a clear set of red lines where Russia knows exactly what to expect in the case of an attack, and which in turn makes it extremely unlikely that they would attempt such an attack even if an opportunistic attack outside of NATO now were to be successful.",False,1666652013.0,t3_yc1jwq,t1_itne37t,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

Even the proposed action in response to a goddamn **nuclear strike** isn’t nuclear in nature. The only reason these are being painted as “escalations” by Russia is because they’re more effective than Russia’s tactics of brutality. We are, paradoxically, winning this war while deescalating it.",False,1666655236.0,t3_yc1jwq,t1_itnghg1,,5,2,0,2,0,0,
