We've been hearing from an adviser to President Zelensky who says Ukraine can beat the renewed Russian offensive in the east with the right weaponry.

Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky's office, says Russia started heavy shelling with artillery yesterday, as its forces began the ""concentrated offensive"" in the east they've been planning.

He tells BBC Radio 4's Today Programme it's ""very important for Ukrainian forces to have heavy weaponry"", including artillery systems, tanks and armoured vehicles.

If Ukraine has these weapons, it will be able to withstand the Russian offensive and have victory in the eastern region, he says.

Zhovkva says arms shipments from the West are ""getting better"" – and the latest $800m batch of US military aid included ""the items we really need"".

Zhovkva adds that Donbas - where the latest offensive is taking place - is very important symbolically for Moscow, as it is where Russia began its ""aggression against Ukraine"" in 2014, capturing parts of the region and establishing ""so-called republics"" there.

(Besides the fact it goes against just about every Regulatory Agency's statutes the world over).

I work in aerospace manufacturing and our site mostly does commercial sensors work for Boeing and Airbus. We have an R&O (repair and overhaul) shop that does airline repairs. Most of our tech is legacy (20+ years old designs), but there are some 21st century designs that we make for valves that end up on GE's engines. Nothing is flight critical per se, but it's going to throw a ton of warning lights when your sensor can't tell you where your flaps are at. 

With that out of the way, most position sensors work using an RVDT (Rotary Variable Differential Transformer). It's relatively simple for a sensor. Rotor spins, magnetic flux changes voltage, boda-bing! You have a change in electrical output that tells you the position of your actuator! 

We're having trouble source these parts from our normal international supply base with the effects from COVID. There is no way, with Russian sanctions, that they are going to be able to obtain a functioning RVDT to repair our sensors with. You can cannibalize from another one of our sensors, but either way you're down a sensor. And good luck testing the part to make sure it works. How are you going to ensure the part meets the functionality requirements if you don't have the test hardware to test the units? 

LVDT's (the linear version of an RVDT), RVDT's, and pressure transmitters are not sexy pieces of technology; they won't march in the May 9th parade, but they're absolutely needed in commercial aerospace. The manufacturers are all American, Japanese, or otherwise privy to sanctions against Russia. 
 
Our parts are pretty simple for Aerospace parts, something more complex like a fuel flow valve assembly, or engine turbine blade? Good luck, Volodya.

A Russian tycoon has blasted Moscow's ""massacre"" in Ukraine and called on the West to end the ""insane war"", in a profanity-laced Instagram post.

Tinkov, one of Russia's most well-known entrepreneurs, founded Tinkoff Bank in 2006.

On Instagram he added: ""Waking up with a hangover, the generals realised that they have a shit army.

""And how will the army be good, if everything else in the country is shit and mired in nepotism, sycophancy and servility?""

Before Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Tinkov's wealth had been estimated at more than $4.4bn (£3.4bn).

But he has since lost his billionaire status as shares in his bank have plummeted, Forbes reported last month.

Day 55 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today they are continuing shelling eastern part of our city, they killed 4 more civilians. They are blind firing into districts where there are no military targets at all. My area is pretty quiet as always with the occasional sound of our own artillery, which actually started sounding heavier than before, probably some new weapon arrived.

Remember when Russia posted article about them winning the war on day 3 and then deleted it almost immediately? Well, they did it again today, but this time the article is way more ominous. Their emergency services posted instructions on what to do in case NATO fires RETALIATION nuclear strike at Russia and then deleted it saying they were hacked.

Not only did they post it, they even included the date of said nuclear strike – April 24th on Easter. I suppose everyone understands what that means? This is not the first time they posted their plans so we can expect them to launch nukes in a couple days. Have they truly gone mad now? Not even China will be able to support them after that, considering that since 2013 we have an agreement with China saying that they will protect us in case of a nuclear attack.

Look at the tags for the article. Originally it was about wildfires in the Nizhny Novgorod region of the country. Another clue to the article being BS is that the image used to describe the effects of a nuke is in English and uses Imperial measurements. Why would a Russian government website use a (probably) American-made infographic? 

Another bit in support of this is, oddly enough, Lavrov’s comments. His spiel about Russia not using nukes were not a planned announcement, they were made in response to questions from the media and are in line with that Western intelligence officials are currently saying: there are no plans for Russia to use nukes at this stage of the conflict.

In Slovyansk, men in uniform began to outnumber civilians on once-busy streets, many of them stocking up on dwindling supplies in the few remaining supermarkets before heading back to the front. Fuel stations were already closed. In Luhansk, electricity was down in most towns after Russian shelling disrupted the main power line.

Slovyansk holds high symbolic importance for both sides. The Donbas conflict began here in 2014, when Russian military veterans led by a former FSB intelligence service colonel seized the local administration. A Ukrainian military offensive retook Slovyansk and nearby Kramatorsk weeks later, but failed to seize the region’s main cities, Donetsk and Luhansk.

Russian troops now are pushing from several directions. The biggest effort is coming from the direction of the town of Izyum, north of Slovyansk, using as many as 50 battalion tactical groups, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of the civil-military administration of the Donetsk region.

“We have no choice but to fight and to hold on to our territory. If there will be no fierce resistance, and if we don’t achieve a victory here, Putin will not stop at us and will keep going further, toward Kyiv, and onwards to threaten the countries of the European Union,” Mr. Kyrylenko said.

I wouldn’t be too alarmed if the eastern Donbas forces are encircled, they will have prepared for it. In such an event the Russian lines will be stretched very thin and will be far more vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery and anti armour attacks.

The concern that Ukraine had with this game-plan is the fate of civilians who stay behind in towns that are given up to Russia.

Regardless, even if Russia is acutely aware of the Ukrainian ploy to stretch out the logistical lines, there isn’t much they can do about it except by advancing a lot slower. That risks allowing western material support to catch up, and for the Ukrainian mobilization efforts to start tilting the numerical advantages on the field. It also risks letting Ukraine to take offensive initiatives along other fixed lines near Kharkiv and Kherson.

Lastly, I think the urgent shift of a lot of Russian material and infantry support in the south away from Mariupol and into the eastern Donbas fight may prolong the siege, which will prevent additional Russian reinforcements from joining the encirclement attempt from the south flank.",1650397461.0,1650397243.0,t3_u6w4fn,t3_u6w4fn,,0,41,0,41,0,0,

The reinforced structures allow Ukrainian fighters to move about and position to skirmish with Russian forces.

The underground facilities on the eastern edge of the city center are shielded by tons of steel-reinforced concrete that can be several yards thick, according to a Russian military analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity because of Moscow’s new censorship law, which threatens lengthy jail time for comments deemed to disparage or undermine Russia’s military. Inside are beds and likely food supplies stored in preparation for a nuclear war. Though vastly superior in number and firepower, Russian forces would struggle to physically expel defenders, the analyst said.

Western analysts believe that Ukrainian forces were provisioned with food and ammunition before the war began on Feb. 24, hoping to hold on for a long fight.

“Russian commanders will be concerned by the time it is taking to subdue Mariupol,” British Air Vice Marshal Mick Smeath, London’s defense attaché in Washington, said Monday, summarizing the British Defense Ministry’s intelligence analysis. “Concerted Ukrainian resistance has severely tested Russian forces and diverted men and materiel, slowing Russia’s advance elsewhere.”

This kind of lines up with my thinking that Russia might make some gains in the east, but in all likelihood will not be able to sustain those gains without great cost. Russia seems most vulnerable when they advance far and quickly before they can establish sustainable supply lines for their front. In this way, it's a sound strategy for Ukraine to purposely cede ground to the Russians and harass them while they are vulnerable.

Beau brings up a good point that Ukraine may not want to employ this strategy again given the way they've treated the civilians in the places they've occupied. 

One way or another, if Russia makes territorial gains, there are going to be analysts (and redditors) who are going talk about it like it's a sign Ukraine is faltering against the mighty Russian army.

> A 140-million-strong population exists in a somnambulistic state, on the verge of losing the last trace of their survival instinct. They hate the authorities, but have a pathological fear of change. They feel injustice, but cannot tolerate activists. They hate bureaucracy, but submit to total state control over all spheres of life. They are afraid of the police, but support the expansion of police control. They know they are constantly being deceived, but believe the lies fed to them on television.

> Russia is a country that lives in contradiction. For example, the president tells us that he is fighting the oligarchs, then awards those same oligarchs with medals ‘For Service to the Country.’ Or the government tells us that prices for consumer goods will not rise, and a month later they double. Or the church teaches us that greed is a sin and ‘it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven,’ while the Patriarch rides in a motorcade and befriends the rich and mighty. Or officials tell us that there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine, while the media talks constantly about Russia’s military successes on the Ukrainian front.

> All that remains for those ashamed of the present and afraid of the future is pride in the past. When there’s no reason to love your country, hate your neighbours. If you are unable to improve your life, ruin someone else’s.

Lesser-known bits (entire article is worth a read):

> ...

> Officials in Washington are now grappling with how much intelligence to give the Ukrainians about bases inside Russia, given that the Ukrainians have already made small helicopter raids on Russian fuel depots. The White House has also held back on supplying some weapons that could strike Russian forces across the border, like rocket artillery, ground attack planes and medium range drones.

> ...

> The United States has also agreed to provide some 155-millimeter howitzers, along with 40,000 matching rounds, while trying to buy Soviet-standard ammunition from countries that use it, including nations outside of Europe, like Afghanistan and **even India**, a longstanding buyer of Russian arms.

> ...

> Unlike the early part of the war, when many countries seemed to compete to announce what they were providing Ukraine, the current race is being run largely in secret.

> ...

> Since the invasion, the Pentagon has cranked up its vast logistical and transportation network. Within four to six days after the White House approves a transfer of weapons from American military stockpiles, the Pentagon has been able to load the matériel onto cargo planes and fly it to about half a dozen staging bases in countries near Ukraine, chiefly Poland and Romania.

> From there, American officials say, the weapons and equipment are loaded onto hundreds of trucks and shipped into western Ukraine using a variety of overland routes. John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said it takes about 24 to 48 hours for the weapons to make their way from the staging areas into the hands of Ukrainian troops.

> “Eight to 10 flights a day are coming into the region, not just from the United States, but from other nations as well,” Mr. Kirby said. “That stuff isn’t sitting around.”",1650408559.0,1650408044.0,t3_u6w4fn,t3_u6w4fn,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

> The party’s leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, who was under house arrest pending a treason investigation when the war began, initially managed to escape but was recently captured by Ukrainian security forces.

> While the party’s other leaders in Kyiv have condemned the Russian invasion, many of its lower-level politicians in the south have chosen to collaborate with Moscow.

Bank of Russia Gov. Elvira Nabiullina said lawsuits are in the works, calling the freezing of Moscow’s gold and foreign-currency reserves “unprecedented on a global scale,” in comments carried by state news agency RIA Novosti.

The U.S. and European Union, as part of a broad package of economic penalties, blocked the Russian central bank from selling dollars, euros and other foreign currencies in its reserves stockpile, constraining its ability to stabilize the ruble and fight inflation. The freeze also limited the government’s efforts to meet its debt obligations. To stabilize the currency, the bank sharply raised interest rates and imposed restrictions on ruble selling.

Ms. Nabiullina didn’t provide details on how Russia would contest the freezing of its assets.

According to Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, sanctions have frozen roughly $300 billion of Russia’s gold and foreign-currency reserves. Its international reserves reached an all-time high of $630 billion in December, according to central-bank data.

The US and France are the two top arms suppliers in NATO. They also happened to be the targets of two of the most successful destabilization campaigns by Russia.  

In France - by funding Le Pen and right-wing radicals with russophilic positions, they have successfully kept France under internal turmoil rather than a more active participant in the ongoing war. Successfully neutering NATOs 2nd largest arms supplier. 

In the US - by funding/promoting Qanon and other alt-right movements, supporting GOP positions with massive propaganda farms,  and hacking democrats' email servers and releasing them to harm Hillary and help Trump... Russia essentially won the election for Trump, who infamously directly intervened to remove supporting Ukraine from the GOP platform. He even got impeached for fuckery with Ukraine and Russia...

I've done my best to keep up with what's happening but I missed this. Does anyone have the full story on what happened? The Russians promised safe passage out of Mariupol but did a double cross as soon as they left? How would that even work? If you double cross the first batch that's leaving, obviously the rest won't leave at all. They'll camp until you attack and try to kill as many of you as possible. I want to believe that they didn't communicate the agreement to other Russian military units and that's why the evacuees got attacked, but after everything I've seen in the past 55 days it honestly sounds like just another 60 IQ move by the Russian military.

Personally, he probably did do this. The lifestyle he was living is something that most of us, if any of us, will never compare to. Throw that in with his entire career, literally being money, add some Russian propaganda with a mix of Kremlin pressure and BOOM.  We either get fertilizer or a selfish murder/suicide. 

I have seen the aftermath of such crimes and have even witnessed the killer do themselves in, in front of me before. Unfortunately, there is never much of a note left behind, typically the ‘note’ is very apparent through some sort of substance abuse, or seen in their financials after the fact. 

Many of these incidents involving white collar individuals, the suspect displays qualities that their life’s work has been foiled and their family and families name is forever tarnished from their, what is seen to them, failures. This type of human may ultimately be categorized as a narcissist and with what limited I know about the extremely wealthy in Russia, I’m sure in their mind, they find this to be a more noble out then what the government will inflict upon them. 

So for us that can, once again I’d love to throw in my personal PSA. Get educated, read up on your history, and vote for those who will allow for the great and horrible to be taught to our youth. Coming from the US, I’m appalled right now by seeing just local school board elections being funded by corporate extreme right groups who want to suppress literature and sciences being taught to our youth.

>These statistics spell trouble for the IMF’s solidarity mandate. But perhaps the best illustration of the Fund’s approach to solidarity can be found in its surcharges: the punitive, pro-cyclical and entirely unnecessary fees that the IMF extracts from its most heavily indebted countries. One might imagine the IMF would reduce if not eliminate its surcharges to align with its “new spirit of solidarity”. But again, the opposite: surcharge fees doubled from $1bn to $2bn between 2019 and 2021, while the number of countries facing surcharges rose from nine to 16. By 2025, the IMF expects that number to rise to 38.
>
>The IMF’s surcharges directly target the world’s vulnerable populations. In Ukraine, for example – where Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government struggles to stave off Russian invasion while providing for over 7 million displaced people – the Fund will have extracted $423m worth of surcharges in just two years: 25% of the country’s entire healthcare budget. “Surcharges are going exactly against what [the IMF is] supposed to be doing,” Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said in a recent event at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “It’s supposed to be helping countries … not extracting extra rents from them because of their dire need.”

Maksim Katz is a Russian oppositional leader currently in Israel. I’ve found his videos to be hugely informative as they provide a lot of insight into what’s actually happening in Russia. I find this particular video very telling “what do people in Moscow think of the war”. Of course, there are plenty of Russians who are very pro Putin and pro war. But there are also a lot of Russians who are clearly horrified with what’s happening. His argument is that the more people believe that they are unique in their opposition, isolated from others in the country, the more they’ll stay quiet.

Oh btw around that time in February the west wasn't even supplying Ukraine with real time intelligence out of fear escalation and tanks and missiles were considered ""offensive weapons"". Artillery was 100% out of the question.

Nowadays after real time intelligence, anti air advanced systems, howitzers, helicopters, tanks, vehicles, anti ship missiles has anyone felt the ""greatest consequences in history"" that Putin mentioned? No. because they were always a bluff.

Putin was always dead scared to engage with the West but a lot of people in the west are buying the Russian ww3 and nuclear Armageddon psy op about some theoretical nuclear war that Putin has no plan to do.

History shows that people like me who always advocated for 100% weapons support for Ukraine from the beginning were right while the scaredy cats were just doing Putin's bidding.

Of course, ""aircraft"" can include things like the still very critical drones and helicopters, but there seems to be a lot of back-and-forth about whether actual fighter aircraft have been sent. I don't think this answers it decisively, but still interesting information from the Pentagon spokesperson in that *Ukraine has more operable fighter aircraft than it had two weeks ago*. That would include any fighters that were lost in the interim. It's possible that there was some critical path components or munitions that the fleet was lacking, and once provided a not-insignificant number of them would be immediately flight-ready.

There are two scenarios in which Putin will use nukes:

1. The madman theory
2. Official reasons

If the madman theory is true and Putin is truly a mad dictator then there is no point in worrying about nukes since Putin can nuke the world at any time. Putin can wake up one day, say that the archangel Gabriel spoke to him in his dream last night about how the USA is the spawn of the devil and then order a nuclear strike on the USA. Nuclear Armageddon happens either way. No point about worrying about it.

If the official reasons are true then Putin will use nukes in two limited scenarios: if a nuke is used against Russia or if the existence of Russia is being threatened (existential threat). Providing Ukraine with weapons doesn't fall in this category since no one will give nukes to Ukraine and Ukraine does not threaten the existence of Russia. Also reminder that Putin doesn't have the nuclear button by himself and a lot of generals have to agree to use nukes.

Now if you are arguing that Putin will use nukes in Ukraine to subdue the Ukrainians in this scenario nukes would have been used when Russia admitted defeat in the Kyiv campaign and retreated from Kyiv. That was when Ukraine won the main campaign of the war since Russia's main goal was to take Kyiv and install a puppet government ala Belarus. Ukraine won the main phase of the war. Putin could have used nukes then but he didn't.

Therefor unless the weapons and aide Ukraine receives involve literal nuclear warheads and hydrogen bombs and unless Ukraine plans to invade Moscow it's pretty pointless to worry about Russia starting a nuclear war regarding any type of aide that the west send.

Also if you are a Russian agent thinking of replying to this comment with nuclear panic with something along the lines of ""yeah dude but there is a LINE and we shouldn't cross that line"" please explain in your comment what the ""line"" actually is, how do you know that is the actual ""line"" and how sending for example airplanes is different than sending howitzers.",False,1650417120.0,t3_u6w4fn,t3_u6w4fn,,0,9,0,9,0,0,

These YouTubers confirm that major brands have left and some people are out of work. They have documented inflation of food/gas which we are all experiencing and inconveniences such as problems with VISA/MasterCard or internet restrictions (circumvented with VPNs).

I’m not saying I disagree nor do I think it’s a bad thing to be hopeful / optimistic, it’s also important to be realistic about what the UA is up against in this next phase of the war.

With the usual caveats about how analysts have been underestimating Ukraine’s chances from the start, the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-donbas-strategy.html?smid=url-copy) reports how Russian forces have learned from their earlier mistakes and seemingly changed strategy. In relevant part:

“Now, Russia has launched a new campaign with a narrower goal focused primarily on capturing Ukraine’s east, and it promises to be much more methodical, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Instead of lightning attacks from the Russian front lines, Moscow’s forces — arrayed in a semicircle that stretches west to east from the city of Izium to Sieverodonetsk — have increased their artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian lines. Many of the Ukrainian troops that are in this region, known as the Donbas, are entrenched in earthworks that have been there for the better part of a decade.

Known as “shaping operations” in military circles, these smaller Russian attacks are often precursors to larger troop movements, or serve as a distraction from other fronts. In the past several days the Russians have sent around 11 more battalion tactical groups into the Donbas, bringing the number there to around 75, according to Pentagon officials. Each group has roughly a thousand troops.

While there have not yet been any large offensives, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Tuesday that Russian forces are laying the groundwork for a future push: more surface-to-air missile systems have been shuttled to the front to protect important positions and more artillery positions have appeared.”",1650391702.0,1650391622.0,t3_u6w4fn,t3_u6w4fn,,0,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Do you or your peers deal with ball bearings? Because from what I heard, Russia has been cut off from high quality ones. If so, not only their aviation industry is fucked, but their factories will begin to shut down one by one. 

I'm thinking about this because it already happened [with LOT flight 5055.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOT_Polish_Airlines_Flight_5055). Soviets were short on roller bearings, so each bearing had only half of the rollers it needed. This seized the engines mid-flight and downed the plane. 

If we were to compare: Russia has almost as almost as many air crash casaulties as USA (10 828 in USA compared to 8 468 in Russia as of 2022), despite their aviation industry being 33x smaller than USA ($19B of supported GDP for Russia compared to $641B for USA).

Eh. Wouldn't be that optimistic. That's a very far advance for Ukraine to sustain at this point, while under significant risk of getting cut off in its own right from its flanks deep within occupied Russian territory.

This attack near Chuhuiv is far more likely motivated by the desire to *create pressure* on the Izyum salient and force the 22-BTG-sized force to be more conservative in its advance, for fear of potentially being cut off.

No. A commander dying isn't evidence of either possibility. It's consistent with Russia winning decisively, Ukraine winning decisively, a stalemate, and everything else in-between.

Folks need to stop trying to read tea leaves about these small micro-battles.

The loss of the Separatist Lieutenant Colonel confirmed this week verifies that the Russians are still making the senior officers lead operations from the front since comms are compromised.  The loss of the Moskova to cover the Black Sea Fleet, rumors of soldiers no longer being paid anymore, and stiff resistance from a now reinforced Eastern UA army who has the benefit of the seasoned troops and equipment from the successful Northern counter offensive is going to make a lot of headaches for the Russian Army.  Couple that w/ the latest batch of US equipment in hand compared to whatever the Russians can pull out of storage and things are going to deteriorate for the Russians.

Even if the Russians manage to just dig in where they are right now they're going to continue to lose men and material at rates they can't replace.  The UAs precision artillery strikes make it so fox holes and fixed Russian positions become open air graves.  Ukrainian counter attacks in the South of the Donbas appear to be working resulting in at least one city being liberated despite the offensive, progress South of Izyum is stalled for the Russians, and if reports are correct 22 BTGs, about a third of the remaining Russian manpower in Ukraine, could be cutoff, starved, and forced to retreat back over the border.

Given the situation at Mariupol w/ bunker busters being used on the last bastion of resistance there, and the Russian reluctance to move the limited amount of bombers they have further into the country who knows if a surprise attack on a bombing run along w/ the airfield on the Russian side of the border could be in the cards?

The UA has made it an edict to launch daring raids and operations that inspire the Ukrainian people as well as international confidence in their cause.

Putin doesn’t believe that there really is such a thing as free will for smaller countries. Putin thinks that the world operates in terms of superpowers - that is US, Russia (because ofc in their mind they are a superpower), China, maaaaybe UK, FR, GER (but even those they believe operate under US influence). Therefore, Ukraine and people of Ukraine don’t have free will, somebody must’ve pushed them towards not wanting Russia, somebody must’ve pushed them towards euromaidan etc. I know the theories about US influence and CIA and whatnot, but people who believe that democracy and stuff happens here only because someone else is pulling the strings really follow Russian propaganda and put no agency towards what we want ourselves. 

But in Russian eyes, Poland, Ukraine, even Germany and other countries in Europe follow what the US wants them to do. Since they believe that Ukraine cannot in any way want democracy and Europeanness on their own, they therefore MUST be guided by someone. And since Russia wants territorial gains from their neighbours, it must also mean that all the other countries must want the same. Since CEE history is basically a long tale of losing and gaining land, same with Ukraine, in Russian mind - and because they believe ukraine is a fake state - it’s totally normal that countries surrounding Ukraine want pieces of it (especially as Orban is in their pocket and he keeps screaming how they want the areas that have Hungarian minorities).",False,1650403048.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5e7vb4,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

41173a5ffe4b7dcd410272e4c8f95afc,u6w4fn,i5ciozd,"> It seems like tanks and other expensive, heavily armored things are obsolete to me, or what am I missing?

Tanks are 120mm gun platforms.

1. 120mm guns are fucking massive -- You can't run into the trees, the gun blows up the tree. You can't run into a house, the gun blows up the house. You can't run into a building. If that gun fires upon you, you are dead, no matter what kind of cover you're behind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyE33Mc6dk

2. There are many kinds of tank rounds -- Canister rounds (aka: Tank-shotguns), Air-burst rounds (aka: defeats trenches by blowing up over the trench), anti-tank rounds (kills enemy tanks), etc. etc. The humans inside the tank decide which ammo to use. 

3. Tanks are invulnerable to soft weapons -- All rifles, sniper-rifles (50-cal), and even 30mm autocannons are ineffective against the Tank's frontal armor. Even ""antitank"" weapons like the AT4 are only somewhat-reliable (450mm of penetration, but tanks have 500mm to 700mm worth of frontal armor), so an AT4 only works on the weaker side, rear, or turret armor at stronger angles (above).

4. Guns are cheap. Those tank rounds are likely $500 or less per shot. Its cheaper to kill enemy tanks with a tank-gun ($500 per shot) rather than with Javelins ($70,000 per shot).

5. Tanks are fast: 45mph on roads is 5x to 10x the speed of a human, especially if that human is running around with a 50lb Javelin system. Tanks can reposition themselves on a dynamic battlefield extremely quickly. If your Javelin is in the ""wrong spot"", the human has to run to the new position at maybe 5mph (50lbs worth of weaponry is really heavy and hard to move).

----------

If you wanted to kill a column of 10 tanks, a **single** tank can kill all 10 enemy tanks. Even if you miss half your shots, 20x shots is only $10,000.

But if you wanted to kill 10 tanks with Javelins, you need 10x Javelins, or roughly $1.7-million bucks worth of Javelins (launchers + missiles, because the missiles can't be reloaded during combat). And what happens if you miss a shot? Now what? What happens if your Javelin is out-of-position? What happens if the enemy tank is hiding inside a tree-line, so that the Javelin isn't reliable?

If you have a tank, you just blow up the trees in front of the enemy tank. Brute force and win.",1650379326.0,1650378875.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5ch8lp,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

So far, there are 18 howitzers being shipped over, which if the standard US Army TO&E that I remember are still in place, makes up an artillery battalion, with 3 sections of 6.   Each section has a Fire Control Unit that's composed of counter-battery radar and signal units to direct fire as needed, plus a HQ-level Fire Control Unit to coordinate for the battalion.   I vaguely recall that 4 counter-battery radar units were sent over in the first batch, which would sort of line up.  That's what I suspect the US is trying to push the Ukrainians towards.

One aspect for both Ukraine and Russia in setting this deadline, though, is that it gives people a light at the end of the tunnel for the sacrifices they have to make. It is infinitely worse in Ukraine than Russia, but Russians are also suffering the effects of sanctions, and by saying that this will all be over in 3 weeks gives people hope that lets them tolerate current conditions. People who have lost jobs because of sanctions or see their paychecks cut because of inflation can believe these things are temporary, and that's enough to continue to give support. If people in Russia were to instead believe that this war will drag on for years where jobs will disappear, quality of life will decline, and families have to worry that their conscript-aged children will die in a war, support for this war would probably decline. 

Finally, while it won't immediately change the dynamics of the war, Russians aren't exactly completely swayed by propaganda. Many don't have a hard opinion on the war and might reflexively support their own country, but that doesn't mean they believe the idea that the war was supposed to drag on like this. The more these deadlines get blown, the more it also strikes at Putin's carefully cultivated persona as this calculating mastermind who's had a long term agenda meant to restore Russia to greatness.

American army commanders and the officer corps went through *trauma* in Vietnam. They suffered from a conflict that was *different* than the one they were set up to fight (which at the time was against the USSR in Europe), where they met hybrid warfare and guerilla warfare against a *very* competent enemy in terrain they were not prepared properly to fight. It was all made worse by the enemy getting access to a lot of USSR equipment, and at the time the USSR had competitive equipment. Their tactics failed them, their equipment failed them often, their training failed them and the politicians most of all failed them.

&nbsp;

That officer corps returned broken hearted. And rose from the ashes to find new purpose in turning the armed forces into a killing machine tailor made to meet the USSR tactics and equipment they frankly underperformed against in Vietnam. A lot of desillusioned officers left the army to find jobs in the arms industry, where *they* brought their lessons with them and together the two, the armed forces and the arms industry, set upon a task to create a force that would be able to take on the USSR and pay them back for what they felt had been done to them in Vietnam.

&nbsp;

Fast forward from 1975 to 1989, and the USSR starts to fall. The Berlin wall comes down, and over the next three years the USSR unravels. Almost at the exact same time as the fruits of the labor put in by the Vietnam officer generation have resulted in what was an *insanely* capable vast machine geared with *one* real purpose in mind: Have the ability to take on the combined armed forces of the USSR and massacre them. And they were. In retrospect, they had equipment in all categories so much better than the Russians that they would have turned the Fulda gap into a killing field of epic proportions. It was the crowning achievement of modern combined arms, high tech equipment and training and military doctrine unmatched at the time.

&nbsp;

And then their intended opponent just collapsed in on itself (it should be mentioned; not in a small part *because* they were trying to keep up with the American arms development). So how do we know that they really were this good? Well, in 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. He had just fought a very long war with Iran in which Iraq's advantage was their enormous stock of, you guessed it; USSR equipment. Iran had manpower, Iraq was backed by technology and superior equipment.

&nbsp;

So the US fought two wars with Iraq; at the time the largest USSR equipment customer outside Russia itself. It really was the USSR equipment vs US equipment field test of all times. The most lethal war machine the world has ever seen, against a USSR equipped very large army. And the USSR development lag since they 70's became painfully obvious. It *was* a onesided massacre.

&nbsp;

The problem for Russia, is that their arms industry was inherited from that USSR. And in reality, because of economic problems and  a really chaotic period lasting almost up until the early 2000's, Russian arms development lost *at least* 15 years. Practically nothing happened in those years of note. And even after that it took time to start ramping up again. Meanwhile, the US remembered the lessons from their slow down in development between the end of ww2 up until after the Korea war, and did NOT stop development. In fact they have kept up pace. 

&nbsp;

And this, is where Russias problem lies when comparing to US equipment. The lost two generations of weapons development. They have never caught up. There are other factors like their brain drain and how small their economy comparatively is. But all in all, Its not even on the same playing field in conventional weaponry.",1650416694.0,1650416325.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5ezz41,,1,11,0,11,1,0,

The Ukrainians are adept at rebuffing Russian advances, but they may lack the hardware to launch a large scale counteroffensive of their own.

Russia may then be willing and able to let it become a stalemate with entrenched troops staring across fields at each other during a ""temporary ceasefire"" or a semi-hot war where shells are fired but no real land changes hands.

Then they just annex or puppet it all, letting a Crimea (if annexed) or Transnistria/Abkhazia/South Ossetia (if puppet states created) situation persist for decades. Nobody will recognize the states/annexation, Ukraine will complain, the West will continue to sanction, and Russia will get poorer and more dependent on an increasingly ascendant China - who will be more than happy to let NATO worry about the Russian paper bear.

Then, maybe someday when Putin is dead and Zelenksyy is out of power, Russia and Ukraine will be able to come to an agreement which would be unthinkable now to both sides (Crimea's annexation recognized and water guaranteed, Donbas goes back to Ukraine in name only but is highly independent and Russian-influenced).

In that nightmare scenario for Russia, EU could obtain energy self-sufficiency without Russian oil/gas, and relegate Russia to seeking markets in India and China, which it is ill suited to serve.   That would be the death-knell for the Russian economy as a ""world power"".  

I'm pretty confident this was the calculus going into the ""special military operation"".  What he didn't bank on was the west pivoting on the moral indignity of Russia's invasion of a sovereign neighbour to drive energy self-sufficiency with or without Ukraine's oil, and also galvanizing neighbouring countries into joining NATO.   And satellite countries afraid that perhaps they should reconsider purchasing Russian equipment... because Ukraine would be armed to the teeth by now, if only they were not hamstrung by lack of operational experience with NATO gear.

Ukraine has essentially dealt Russia the quintessential no-win scenario here.  No matter what happens, they emerge from this a Chinese vassal state.

[edit: my point being, this may be tantamount to an existential threat, and while I'm not a nuclear doomsayer, it would be unwise to discount thinking along these lines... the question is whether or not Russia wishes to continue as a vassal state, or a wasteland of radioactive black glass, and I suspect the former is preferable if cool minds prevail]",False,1650419490.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5f8dnb,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

In Germany, back in 2008, I was asked if we have computers and internet at home and the host (a well off person from former West Germany) was 110% sure that we all spoke Russian as our native tongue (and also that we’re stealing and prostitution, of course). All of these things have been said about Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles etc. based on our history and geographical location -  because we’re in the Eastern Europe, we therefore MUST be poor, stupid, criminal, live either in igloos or mud huts and clearly be inferior in every way to clearly more superior Western Europeans.

Because of such opinions which have been told to me, to my face, and many others, I dislike saying that nation X is XYZ.

That said….. I find it really really hard not to judge Russian people. The dislike of Russian interpretations of history, culture, and their own importance of greatness has been ebbing and flowing here this way and that way for 30 years. It’s never been gone completely because Russia has ensured that it wouldn’t be gone by being antagonistic and plain old bully, but there have been periods where we’ve been able to kind of just ignore who our big neighbour is. For Eastern Europe, Russia has always been a bit like St Helen’s - a sleeping giant, potentially erupting in the future. The west had the pleasure of imagining that Russia had changed, but here those illusions were kind of dashed already back in 2007-08 and we’ve been monitoring Russia with growingly ill at ease. Had Russia been a normal neighbour, I think after 30 years we in CEE would’ve been already differently minded towards them. 

Russia has just single-handed my proven that every bit of fear and xenophobia directed at them in the past 30 years has, in fact, been kind of true. They’ve single-handedly undone any and every kind of progress in eastern and Central Europe of the last 30 years. The fear was slowly, ever so slowly, abating, because whilst the younger generation lacked memories and personal experiences and knew stories, they hadn’t actually seen the big bad Russia of our grandparents and parents; now they see too, now they hear too, and they too will be telling this to their kids and grandkids. That’s another 50 years of wariness and fear and Russia has single handed my done this.

German people were made to see their complicitness in Nazi crimes. German people were deprived of their self-governance for nearly a decade (not saying this should happen to Russia btw). Germany didn’t change out of the goodness of its heart and attitudes towards German people were still so and so even a few decades post-WWII. Put they’ve largely redeemed themselves, or had prior to Ukraine and the mess that is their political messaging. 

Russia and Russian people need to actually face their nation’s problematic facets. We shouldn’t attack the whole nation, but they also need to understand that they cannot just say that they decide nothing and they answer for nothing. If they say that Germans as a nation were guilty of fascism during WWII (and they do), then they shouldn’t be hypocrites about themselves. 

We should remain civil and European in our attitudes, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t call their opinions or their state’s behaviour for what it is.",False,1650395031.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5debmg,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Russia has no reason to believe a single thing we say (they think we don't of them, and they're not wrong).

Therefore, should we put boots on the ground, regardless of what we say we're going to do with them, their assumption is ""they're coming for us"".  That once we cleanse Ukraine, we'll simply keep on going.  They know in that scenario they're going to not only lose, but disappear as a singular entity, so they'll go scorched earth.

Therefore we need to do everything we can to help, without giving them something they can interpret as ""we're coming for you"".  Which means boots on the ground are the last in a long list of options.  There are tons of other things that come first, and we're running down that list.

I don't see China as being in the same boat about Taiwan.  For starters, this debacle (and i'm sure they see it as one) has taught them a bunch of things:

1. Better to restrain and be thought of strong than to invade and expose your weakness
2. Sanctions are a lose/lose, at best
3. Don't give your enemies a unifying cause/rallying cry
4. If you can take it politically, as opposed to militarily, do so
5. Nukes are really only good at preventing the worst consequences/retaliations

I imagine right now China is asking, how can we get a unification-friendly government elected in Taiwan like Hong Kong.  Going with military is probably no longer a plan that is being entertained.  That's not to say they aren't doing military things, just not in the direction of invasion.  They don't want sanctions (a lose/lose) and don't want a hard check against their military might to see if it's real or paper.  So they talk big, but are looking for a way to accomplish their goals with subterfuge rather than might.

So, I wouldn't be worried about China - not that way.  They'll probably get Taiwan but it'll be a long, slow, multi-decade Hong Kong-type osmosis/infiltration.  And I bet there are think tanks in the west deciding what we should do about it.

It's the lack of military action by the west that concerns me too.  In 1990, we liberated Kuwait from Iraq and held an active no-fly zone over Iraq for \~20 years.  Were they part of NATO?  No. We put troops in Saudi Arabia to protect the country from provocation from Iraq.  Was Saudi Arabia a part of NATO? No.

All that is superficial, there were many reasons why we went into these conflicts, but the sentiment still stands.

True. Unfortunately, this doesn't change the fact that Russian attack, however counterproductive and destructive for the Russia itself, is also incredibly destructive for the country that was attacked.

The mere fact that you can repel the attack doesn't mean you want to be attacked.

Unfortunately, also true, because of goddamn nukes.

If you are neighbors with someone who has nukes, and you can't feasibly get nukes, and that someone wants your land, the only reliable course of action is to get into an alliance that forces someone who has nukes to respond if you are attacked.

Our parts run on a decently complex gear assembly that drive a shaft from connected to an RVDT. 

It's simple stuff any upper classman in any engineering department should be able to toy with and figure out once the case is open, it's getting the complex magnetic assembly replaced, set right, calibrated, and locked in place that's the hard part. 

RVDT's themselves aren't hard to understand. Spiny bit (rotor) changes how the pixies (magnetic flux) dance and that changes the voltage in the coils of the stationary bit (stator). Think like an electric DC motor, but AC. It's replacing them when they fail that's hard. 

Who is Russia going to get fresh RVDT's from? Tamagawa, Moog, and Honeywell (and their distributors) are out of the picture. It's not easy to go from 0 to 100% on manufacturing stators, rotors, bearings, etc. that go into these sensors without that industrial knowhow and supply.

1) The political system itself is slow, made worse by a three coalition government. Great for deliberation, not so great for fast reactions. More action will come, it will just take time.
2) Foreign policy considerations: Getting Macron back into office and preventing le Pen is even more essential from a german PoV than whatever happens in Ukraine. So a lot of hesitation is related not to do anything which could mess up the French elections (like an early oil embargo which would rise inflation in France even further).
3) The simple fact that there are very few arms to give. Germany has some fancy weapons systems, but not much in storage. Given a couple of months production can be upped significantly, but right now there's not much left without completely striping an already undersupplied army. (For example the patriots send to the east (Slovenia I think) to free up the S300s for Ukraine make up 25% of our total long range air defence). Same goes for our old stock of tanks etc. if anything that's in worse shape than the Russian reserves.

Additionally the gas issue is seriously discussed here, but opinion is very split since the cost will be severe (less so for oil, I definitely see a chance of that happening).

ISIS-L tried to fuck up the relationship with an attack, but USA / Taliban were too smart for that. Taliban performed rear-guard duties, protecting the Kabul airport from ISIS-L, while US Army processed US Citizens / Afghan citizens on the airlift operations.

------

USA has been leveraging those diplomatic channels to try to argue for things like Afghani women should remain in school (and the Taliban clearly don't care about that). So we don't have **much** control of the Taliban, but we do have some mutual interests and clearly some kind of diplomatic contact.

In any case, the Taliban may be an adversarial group, but diplomacy is clearly possible with them. Its not a very good relationship between USA and Taliban, but if we have diplomatic ties, we might as well try to do stuff with it.

I think its an uncomfortable truth for all involved: the Taliban are acting better than expected diplomatically (bad for US politics, because we demonized them so long), and bad for Taliban-politics, because they demonized USA for so long (It also sets up a fight vs ISIS-L / ISIS-K and the Taliban). But both sides clearly were tired of fighting and begrudgingly accepted the peace terms.

Don't get me wrong... the Taliban are still an ass-backwards group of anti-women fundamentalist extreme Muslims who hate music, freedom and democracy. But the Taliban also have wants: they want USA to unfreeze funds, they want more global recognition, etc. etc. These wants/needs of the Taliban allow USA some opportunity for trades and diplomacy. I don't know what the USA can offer specifically to the Taliban, but that's the job of diplomats to figure out.

Taliban would also be the owners of all that military equipment left over in Afghanistan. An arms-deal with the Taliban is not entirely out of the question.

Lubricant isn't as good once you scorch it all away.

I've seen mortar rounds get stuck instead of sliding down due to this.

One easy trick is to have a rag on a stick and a bucket of water to wash it out every few rounds. I wonder if in a vehicle that tight a small can of dry silicon lube might not help out, just a shot in the chamber now and again.

The word ""President"" was traditionally used to describe the head of a club or social group. George Washington specifically chose the term so that USA's leaders would remain humble and ""small"".

Of course, that didn't work out as George Washington hoped. But it was a good attempt on behalf of George Washington. 

-----

The word ""Prime Minister"" is grandiose. People look up to ""Ministers"", and a ""Prime Minister"" is even grander than that.

In contrast, USA's leaders are ""humble"" words: our ""President"" leads our ""Secretaries"".

Generally the strategies are pushing the pain onto businesses, foreign investors and normal Russians.

Russia opening up in the 90s was a great investment opportunity for the West. Untapped or under-utilised resources and manpower.

In this case some of the main issues I see are going to be:

1. Stagflation. Interest rates are already high, growth is neutral/negative depending on who you listen to and inflation is rising. Russia is likely to slip into a high inflation situation without the interest rates buffer to control it, and without many of the other keys given its international situation.

2. Foreign investment. Asset stripping foreign companies doesn't make them likely to return. Locking foreign investor capital into your stock market and preventing selling makes people a *little* risk averse in the future - it's kinda a ""burn the bank down"" play.

3. Sovereign debt. Russia has less debt than a lot of countries, but it won't take much for that to spiral, and interest on it will be sky high due to its credit rating

4. Fossil fuel divestment/energy security. Russia's economy significantly runs on fossil fuels, with many countries and companies moving away from fossil fuels in the longer term, and trying to cut down on energy exposure to Russia in the short/medium term, the size and Russia's access to those markets will shrink.

Please note that Russia has done the same to all of its Slavic and non-Slavic neighbors over the course of its existence.

A different take on it

If you add that traditionally Germany get's blamed when there are problems within EU too, add there Germans tend to accept guilt easier because of their past, add that other countries are doing the same like Germany but nobody cares/cared, add that countries shift their own responsibility to Germany by saying ""we would do it, if Germany does"", when they know they can never accept those conditions, but fully knowing they couldn't either. Some part of me wants to cut all fossil fuel, so they see the effects of what they demand atm lol. They could do more, I would agree, but most of the news and especially twitterexpert opinions are very superficial, and don't take into account the difference in political systems we have here in EU and Germany.

Edit: Also add that Germans are naturally critical of their politicians, they like to read how everything sucks and are never satisfied. That is kinda the mentality the newspaper like to present. Scholz would do better if he would confront those critics and praise efforts more, he leaves too many openings by being vague",1650403175.0,1650402868.0,t3_u6w4fn,t1_i5e88qm,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Germany cannot do messaging if their lives depended on it. 

Germany almost took a perverse pride in underfunding its military, to the point where it was causing issues. I'm not sure what their inventory is like, but it's probably not good. 

If the fucking AfD support your position, please consider if its correct or not. It's like being endorsed by the Klan 

Scholz is trying to stop his economy from crashing

&#x200B;

This last one is me:

I just don't think the will is there to send more. Germans had no problem pushing through NS2 despite US sanctions, Polish concerns, Ukrainian fears. etc. Yes it's a complex and nuanced process. But at the end of the day Germany wanted a fucking pipeline and Germany got it. 

Merkel took all the credit for standing up to the EEVVVIIILLL USA. The German people wanted it. Now all of a sudden there's ""Analysis paralysis"" ""Germany needs to move in concert with it's Allies"" that it told to fuck off recently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Valid critique is not infighting, valid critique is valid. As every fucking European told me during the BLM riots, no matter how much anyone tried to explain nuance to them. If the facts make you look bad, better change what you're doing, not explain away the facts.

Context matters, and it remains true and worth pointing out that Russia has turned war crimes into their indefensible state policy. 

Whataboutism is not a valid defense for committing awful actions anyway. The only difference between America and Russia is that while both have awful nationalistic wings in their body politic, America's democracy has in-built accountability mechanisms, such as a free press and regular elections. The result - most Americans eventually realized Iraq was an awful, stupid exercise of neo-imperialism.

Tactical nukes will escalate the war and potentially open up Russia to tactical nuke attacks and escalate into a global nuclear war and winter.

Russia will never be invaded or face an existential threat as long as they have their nukes as deterrents. But using it will make it very possible. So unless Putin and Russia are prepared to lose their lives and get wiped off the Earth. It’d never be used.

And even then what I see is less about destroying the Russian people, more about dealing with the systemic issues of Russia.  Russia has struggle with the same corruption, strongmen, imperialism, religious cult issues going back to when the Duchy of Moscow started working for the mongols and conquering its neighbors.  I mean they have had multiple different government types yet always end up with a strongmen with an ideological/religious following who is imperialist and hyper corrupt.  I mean,  go back and read documents on Russia from the 1800s… they literally read like they could’ve been written today.

And big difference here between the Arabs and 9/11.  Al Qaeda wasn’t the chosen government by the Arab world, they were a criminal group.

I didn't bring it up as it was apparently AGAIN brought up by Russia and this time in a very particularly creepy way.  My posts are all designed to demystify and lower the fear level over such weapons.  60 odd days of conventional weapons have done more physical destruction (and likely more killing) than a tactical nuke would.   

Use of strategic nukes has never been consider likely.  Full stop.  

Any intervention including the US provision of weapons, or any EU country's provision of weapons, and the escalations thereof (which are occuring as we speak) COULD lead to WWIII.  Of important note WWWIII and use of tactical nukes are neither one assured to lead necessarily to the other.  That critical error of logic, and tactics, is a dangerous one, in and if itself, as it is a fear Russia would exploit.  

Russia has practiced and gamed out the use of tactical nukes as an ""escalate to deescalate"" maneuver.  I'll leave it to you to look that up although I am sure it has come up an ungodly amount of times.  It is precisely being mentally unprepared for such an eventuality that gives it meaning.  It is not dissimilar to US and USSR above and below ground tests in the past.  If they try it we ignore it and proceed or deploy one that their people will notice and induce similar fear.  As I mentioned these could be detonations above oceans that demonstrate capability and resolve and result in less destruction than previous ground tests ever did.  Or it could be their use on the battlefield.  The latter obviously more escalatory and dangerous but still not a defacto beginning of WWIII or the end of the world.  Our position has always been one where we would not use them first.  That has never been Russia's.

Russia has limited ability to just ""set"" such a price.

They have like 20X the range of the Turkish drones meaning they can loiter longer and be based further from the front lines preventing them from being destroyed on the ground. They have a way higher flight ceiling meaning the Russians are less likely to detect them and only the most advanced ground based AA systems can even reach them. They carry a way bigger payload too meaning they are armed with longer range and more powerful weapons so they can often fire them from out of Russian AA range. 

Even if they aren't used as much for attacking Russian positions, they provide a much better intelligence platform from a range that's generally pretty safe compared to smaller drones that must get in close to be of much use. These this will probably be hanging out between 25,000 and 50,000 feet and a couple dozen miles from Russian positions. They also move like 3 or 4X faster than the Turkish drones again making them a faster reacting, harder to hit, target:

>But comparing the TB-2 to an MQ-9 is like comparing a Humvee to a passenger sedan. The MQ-9 has a wingspan of 66 feet compared to 39 feet for the TB-2. The MQ-9 weighs in at about 11,000 pounds fully loaded with fuel and weapons, compared to 1,400 pounds for the TB-2. The Reaper is twice as fast, with a speed of about 300 miles per hour versus about 135 miles per hour for the TB-2.

>Perhaps most significant is the MQ-9’s vastly superior range: up to 1,200 miles for the base model and 1,600 miles for the ER (extended range) version, compared to just 93 miles for the TB-2. The Turkish drone would have to operate fairly close to the front lines in eastern and southern Ukraine, rendering it more vulnerable to Russian air and missile strikes on airfields. But the MQ-9 has the range to operate from safer bases in eastern Ukraine: given that the distance from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv to Kiev in the east is 291 miles – and Lviv to the southern port of Odessa is 800 miles – the extra reach of the Reaper could be crucial to preserving Ukraine’s drone fleet from Russian retaliation. Indeed, the MQ-9 would have the range to strike deep into Russia, and as far as Moscow.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpeck/2022/04/13/ukraine-may-get-us-mq-9-reaper-strike-drones/?sh=3c240cf85b3b

Most shockingly the range of these drones would make it possible for them to strike special targets deep into Russia including Moscow itself. Obviously Russian air defense would be a risk, but remember, a rogue Ukrainian drone from the Soviet era made it across like three NATO countries air defenses before crashing earlier in the war. If these was a target of significant enough importantance there's no reason these drones couldn't be risked to take it out.

Of those:

- Moldova has no real ability to conduct warfare operations.
- Azerbajan has already started with renewed actions against Russia supported Kazakhstan.
- Georgia is a possibility, but no idea if they would decide to take back the part of Ossetia that Russia stole.

Countries with active non territorial disputes with Russia, but who are governed by Russian puppets that may decide to throw the yoke off:

Belarus and Chechnya.

- Chechnya already has fighters in Ukraine on the Ukranian side, but the Russian cleansing of Chechnya has been so aggressive that a large scale uprising against their puppet regime is unlikely. Their government has openly and actively supported the Russian war.
- Belarus also has fighters active in Ukraine on the Ukranian side, less than Chechnya has. They have a more recent Puppet regime, or at least has not been as brutally subjugated as Chechnya has. There is also evidence of active resistance to the current government's support for Russia in the war, and their government has also resisted Russian pressure to join or support the war.

Other areas or conflicts that may be impacted by Russia nosediving on the International ""partner to have"" charts.

- Syria: Assad has long been propped up by Russia and Russian military support, both in material and active combatants. Russia has already moved some of their mercenary forces and troops from Syria to Ukraine. If Assad loses or has diminished support from Russia his regime may be under intense pressure militarily, as well as diplomatically. I expect that should Russia implode in the coming year that Assad will finally be overthrown, or to save his skin and not go the way of other recent middle eastern dictators, that he start reaching out to the West for a settlement that gives him a way to transfer power and stay alive.
- India: India has a looming border kerfuffle (""Yes Raymond, I am causing a _kerfuffle_."") with China, and India has historically relied on Russian shootie stuff to fight their battles. While India has made large efforts to negate their relyance on Russian gear, it may be a short term problem for them given that China has decided to start looking at their border region with hungry eyes.
- Japan: Japan recently told Russia ""you are talking mad smack for someone occupying our Islands."" If Russia gets further bogged down in Ukraine they might decide to take their islands back in what would effectively be a continuation of World War 2. The two countries never officially signed a peace accord after WW2 so are technically still at war.
- Iran has recently cosied up to Russia, even though Russia has tacitly supported sanctions against Iran. They have allowed Russian aircraft to use their airspace for missions in Syria, with videos showing Iranian Tomcats escorting Russian strategic bombers during and leading up to missile strikes in Syria. If Russia is no longer a good prospect for them as an international partner, they might decide to look towards China for support and partnerships.

So, we over spend on healthcare by 19-8.5=10.5% of GDP = 3 entire militaries.

When one opponent in a conflict has no nukes the likelihood of any forward steps on that spectrum is low, but introduce multiple nuclear armed countries to the mix and likelihood of some kind of release of nuclear weapons increases dramatically. And that release could be unpredictable as warfare works on its own internal logic that can create enormous pressure to respond to imperfect information. A spiral of escalation can ensue that pulls all participants towards a nuclear exchange they never contemplated. 

For example, NATO sets up a no fly zone. They are obliged to destroy or cripple Russian AA capabilities. They use cruise missiles to strike AA sites inside Russia. A handful of civilians are killed in those strikes. Russia responds by attacking Western weapons bound for Ukraine inside Poland. They strike a number of railway yards and trains and kill a number of civilians as well. NATO responds by attacking Russian Iskander missile systems in Belarus and Russia.  The Russians, fearing their nuclear capabilities are being threatened manage to locate and destroy an Ohio class nuclear submarine carrying quite a few trident nuclear armed missiles. The Pentagon is now going insane because they fear the nuclear triad is at risk. Nuclear bombers are scrambled in Alaska and all missile silos are put on high alert. The world is now a hairsbreadth from nuclear annihilation and no one even planned for it to go this way. It is a series of stepwise escalations that eventually lead to unintended nuclear war.

 >One element of the demonstrations of the Velvet Revolution was the jingling of keys to signify support. The practice had a double meaning – it symbolized the unlocking of doors and was the demonstrators' way of telling the Communists, ""Goodbye, it's time to go home"". A commemorative 2 Euro coin was issued by Slovakia on 17 November 2009, to mark the twentieth anniversary. The coin depicts a bell with a key adjoining the clapper.

 >On 30 June 2018, in Amesbury, two British nationals, Charlie Rowley and Dawn Sturgess, were admitted to Salisbury District Hospital in Wiltshire, England. Police determined that they were poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent of the same kind used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, 8 miles (13 km) away, almost four months prior. Sturgess died on 8 July, and Rowley regained consciousness two days later.

 >Alexander Litvinenko was a former officer of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the KGB. In 1998, Litvinenko and several other Russian intelligence officers said they were ordered to kill Boris Berezovsky, a Russian businessman. After that, the Russian government began to persecute Litvinenko. He fled to the UK, where he criticised the Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.

Taliban performed rear-guard duties. Perhaps they weren't the most competent at it (ISIS-L still managed to hit the area with a suicide attack), but they seem to have done what they could.

Russia needs those soldiers to defend their gains. But those soldiers will be dead from this new offensive. In effect, this new Donbas offensive Russia is pushing is obviously a strategic error and only serves to weaken Russia's position in the long term.

But everyone chanted ""Defund the police"" like it was an easy solution to a complex problem. Or referred to the cops as slavecatchers. Then the ongoing ""Third world country with a Gucci belt"" memes.

Yes, removing funding from Police agencies would reduce shootings, but they do actually suppress QoL crime. It sucks having your car broken into 5 times a year. It really sucks when the DAs won't charge people for these crimes.

So without more complex harm reduction strategies, all you're going to end up with is people paying the price for petty crime, feeling unsafe, and then voting in ""Tough on crime"" judges, DAs, and Politicians. Which is what happened. I believe that the Democrats despite their garbage messaging are the right people to solve this problem. Tackle it incrementally and iterate out. Voting in Republicans because you feel unsafe is likely to make sure you don't have a broken car window, but you won't have healthcare, or a house.

So with that background in mind, when I kept pointing out that ""Defund the police"" as a rally cry around the nation was stupid. It played well in some markets, but caused the dems to lose in others. It was dismissed and I was called a slavecatcher apologist who was trying to shy away from the legacy of racism. etc etc etc. I needed to change immediately or else I was as bad as people shooting PoCs. The fact is, ""Defund the police"" is a braindead slogan that may have cost us a few House seats. 

We need to keep the (R)s out of Congress until the party is sane again or it disappears and someone else comes to power. We need to be smart about how we vote and we need to mobilize people. And we have to keep showing up.

But nope. We're all just racist fucks who would never achieved the level of enlightenment of our superior European peers because we'll forever be backwards hicks. etc etc etc. There was a lot of vile hateful shit thrown at the US over the last few years. That was part of it.

Now Europe is under attack by a hostile power, France and Germany are nowhere to be found (Leadership wise), all of a sudden the US/UK are doing the heavy lifting for Ukraine and supporting through the crisis. We're not as bad, and people say they were only joking. etc.

>Every moment in war, every moment of death, is experienced in a different way by those who are involved.

There's no reason to wax poetic/humanistic about it. To the guy in the trench, it doesn't matter if his unit was spotted by a pilot with binoculars in a biplane or a drone, the artillery barrage hits him all the same.

Russian held Ukrainian territory != Russian territory

And just like you’re arguing that no one knows what Putin is thinking and he won’t follow the doctrine, how would you know if NATO won’t respond in kind? 

Also there’s a ladder of escalation before tactical nukes will even be considered. Killing civilians and using phosphorus bombs are already escalations. Next would be chemical weapons. Russia has only reached this step. 

Tactical nuke considerations are still pretty far off. Tactical nukes are an escalation, I’m not saying it’s MAD but it’ll open the door to that scenario. Consequences of using nukes are real. Both Putin and Russia knows it. So why would they want to open the door?

If Russia loses this current push in the east then they've defacto lost.  I fully expect a tactical nuke to be used before that happens.  Could be in Ukraine or over the North Atlantic (unpopulated of course with low to no causulties). Technically if over open international waters this isn't an attack on anyone.  NATO responds with a tactical nuke over arctic or Pacific waters near, but not in, Russian territorial waters...or even over Siberia.  For Russia this is psychological warfare with the scariest weapon.  Would this break the alliance?  It will if people find it so terrifying it is ""unthinkable.""  As described this is no more frightening than the many above ground tests done in the 1950's by both Russia and the US.  It was so common people would have bought tickets if they could have.  When detonated above ground the radiation mostly goes into the atmosphere and is diluted.  Consider that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are both now inhabited but Chernobyl area is not (nor will be in foreseeable future). Putin is a psychopath and only worried about his survival.  He may be smart enough to know he won't survive a full exchange.  But he also may be smart enough to know what you fear.  Stay calm and carry on...here are some fantastic pieces on Putin.

The mobilized are sent to the line of collision to reveal the arrangement of firing positions of the Ukrainian army at the cost of their lives.

>With a weight of 4,200 kg (9,300 lb), the M777 is 41% lighter than the 7,154 kg (15,772 lb) M198 howitzer it replaces.[9][10]. Much of the weight reduction is due to the extensive use of titanium.[11] 
  
It's also explicitly *not* a design feature of the M198 (15,772 lb):

There was plenty of doubt as to how the TB2s were perform.  The Azerbaijan drones were a warning, one that Russia seems not have learned from.  But, to be fair, Russia is not Armenia. There were multiple defense/OSINT analysts who were absolutely stunned at how much damage the Ukrainians were doing in the early days of the war.  They probably should have paid more attention to how Turkey used the Bayraktars in Syria and the Azerbaijan/Armenia war.

The Army, Airborne, and Special Forces combined only account for about 350,000 of that 900,000, according to their own data.  That's a much more accurate number for their available ""combat personnel"".

Security trumps economic and other concerns.

Escalate to de-escalate doesn't mean escalate forever or escalate into lose-lose situations.

The sanctions are hitting Russia's economy harder than the West, but it's still impacting the West as well.

The West has weak links as well and there will be elections in years to come. A couple of pro-Russian leader getting elected and withdrawing from these harsh actions will make the Western alliance crumble.
