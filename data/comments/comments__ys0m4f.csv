Day 261 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet in the city, but the same can’t be said about Kharkiv oblast. Starting around midnight missile launches from Belgorod were reported, and all of the missiles landed somewhere in oblast, we don’t know where exactly. There were a couple more air raid alerts throughout the night, all of which were, thankfully, uneventful. Then just recently, at 8pm, another missile launch from Belgorod happened, with about 4 missiles, all of which went somewhere to Kharkiv oblast again.

The speed of Russian retreat was really impressive. Just 2 days ago they announced that they are leaving Kherson, people were predictably saying how they are probably setting up a trap for us, and that it will probably take weeks for them to leave, if they were even going to leave at all. And now, just 2 days later, they are already gone, faster than anyone predicted too. I guess their retreat from Kharkiv oblast was just a training exercise, so that they can improve their skills before Kherson retreat. 

Finally the people of Kherson are free from the “Russian world”. The difference between how Russians were “welcomed” in Kherson by the people who were stopping their tanks with their bare hands, and how our military was welcomed today by everyone with love and Ukrainian flags is very apparent. What were Russians saying, “87% of people in Kherson wanted to join Russia”? Yeah, that so “believable”. 

I bet that if Russians weren’t thrown out of Kharkiv oblast before their “referenda” they would have said that we wanted to join them as well, probably with some stupid percentage like 95-99%, because in their sick minds they think that everyone here wants to be Russian, even though here we hate them with passion, honestly probably more than anyone else in Ukraine. Because a lot of people here, including us, have/had families from Russia, and all of them turned into brainwashed zombies as soon as the war started, immediately started calling everyone here Nazi and saying that they are coming to liberate us. Never again will we trust Russians, and hopefully we will get a big wall with a moat along the entire border as soon as the war ends.

Like I don't think if we went back in time and told ourselves where we would be today that even the most optimistic would believe it. The initial invasion was so fast and it did not look good at all. In the south, Russia had taken their first administrative capital in Kherson, were on the outskirts of Mykolaiv, and pushing north and east very fast. In the north, the Russians rapidly advanced and were right on the outskirts of Kyiv and had surrounded and blockaded Chernihiv. In the east, Sumy was surrounded and the Russians were starting to probe into Kharkiv city itself.

Even as we wanted to hope for the best, it was looking very grim at that moment and I think many of us were expecting the worst. But then something happened, Ukraine won 3 key battles early on in each region that were major turning points in the war:

1. Battle of Irpin: This stopped the main Russian force on the outskirts of Kyiv and was the city before Kyiv itself. If it fell, Russia would have an open lane to Kyiv.
2. Battle of Kharkiv: This was instrumental in keeping that entire region under Ukrainian control. If it fell, not only would it be massively demoralizing to Ukraine, but it would let Russia push west far deeper into Ukraine.
3. Battles of Voznesensk: Ukraine repelled a couple attacks on this town north of Mykolaiv. Had it fallen, it would've given the Russians a bridgehead over the river and another route to Odessa without needing to take Mykolaiv first.

If Ukraine had lost any one of those battles, the situation would likely be very, very different today. It's crazy how far Ukraine has come from relying on mostly outdated weaponry and ambush attacks to launching full offensives with modern western weapons and pushing back the ""second strongest army in the world.""",False,1668187973.0,t3_ys0m4f,t3_ys0m4f,,0,87,0,87,0,0,

> Mykhailo, the 14 years old son, regained consciousness first.  He miraculously pulled out his younger sister Irina, 9 years old, and then he pulled his mother out of the car.  His older brother and sister, Oleksandr and Tetyana, died in the explosion.

> The mother and her 2 surviving children then set out to look for a village nearby.  Two hours later, they reached the destroyed Cairo bridge.^1  

[*They were all still badly injured . . .*]

> To save his family, the boy then swam across the inlet,^2 and reached the village of [Novokairi](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Novokairy,+Kherson+Oblast,+Ukraine,+74362/@47.0140804,33.5802974,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x40c37b4465431c29:0x4223e037959a49fe!8m2!3d47.0141796!4d33.5992625?hl=en-us). There, the 14yo Mykhailo saw our soldiers.   Our soldiers took a boat to the other shore to rescue the mother and sister.  The family was then evacuated to Krivy Rih and is now in our hospitals. 

> The conditions of the mother and sister are serious, but stable. Our doctors did everything to save them.

> This story goes through the soul. These are the destinies of people. This is the heroism of the children of our generation.

> I am sure that Mykhailo is worthy of the highest state awards. And I will definitely make a submission for the award. And the a!#&$%s that fight the women and children will burn in h*ll. And we will help them in this.

>First information about losses of the RF Armed Forces in retreating from Kherson and Berislav. AFU bridgehead in Novaya Kakhovka

>By the afternoon of November 11, the AFU occupied Beryslav and entered Kherson. There is no light or water in the city because Russian troops blew up infrastructure before leaving. But this does not prevent locals from greeting the Ukrainian army in the streets.

>On the same streets, the Russian soldiers and Russian guards remaining in the city are also roaming the streets. Many of them have changed into civilian clothes. Some are hiding in basements, others are moving or have already moved to the Korabelny district. From there, one can still try to cross the Dnieper.

>According to one of our sources, he left the city this way around noon, along with several soldiers and officers who had lost their units.

>""There were up to two thousand of ours left in the city, according to my estimates. Mobs of motorized riflemen, Rosgvard, some stragglers or drunks of soldiers and officers. I took out the group I was able to gather. The rest are all getting out as best they can. Someone decided to hide on Korabel (the area of Kherson behind the Koshevaya River). Some just hung back. Everyone is scared of the locals. They understand that it's okay if they turn them in, but they will be killed, because there is a reason for it. We didn't have matinees there for half a year. Why do I think it was up to two thousand? Because the freshest brigades, which were brought to the right bank two or three days before the escape, had to be the last to leave. They do not know the terrain, they do not know the city, they are afraid of everything. They were supposed to be led to the crossings, but they were not. They spent the night at the assembly points, but no one came for them. I know this from the guys' own words. And I also know that more than half of them did not make it across at night. That's over a thousand. And there are some more who simply did not manage to get to the crossing point or did not get the order"", - says the Russian officer who left Kherson around noon on November 11.

>According to Ukrainian officers, up to 1,500 more Russian Armed Forces soldiers remained near Berislav and scattered in the vicinity. As for those killed by artillery and rocket fire, so far we only know that there are many. At night, several watercrafts were destroyed on the river, on which the soldiers were trying to cross.

>Staff officers of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation in Melitopol and in Crimea believe that 800 to 1,700 people could have been killed and wounded (in this case almost guaranteed to be captured or die of wounds) while retreating from the enemy fire. Between 3,500 and 4,500 servicemen of the Russian Armed Forces and the Russian Guard could not make it across in time. They are now divided into small groups and trying to wait it out. Some of them will try to cross this night. We are waiting for the middle of the day on November 12, when the first data will appear from the retreated units and from the headquarters about those units that are missing in their entirety.

>The Ukrainian Armed Forces were able to seize a bridgehead on the left bank near Novaya Kakhovka, which they not only hold, but also expand. In the next 24 hours, they will probably continue to clear the city, after which they will start setting up crossings to continue the offensive on the left bank of the Dnieper, where the Russian Armed Forces do not yet have a built-up line of defense.

>As for the Russian military equipment, no more than one-fourth or even one-fifth of what was left on the right bank in the evening of November 10 could be removed to the left bank.

>""When the crossings were covered with fire, they just started throwing the equipment. I think that the Ukrainians took several hundred units of armored vehicles alone, not counting trucks and other vehicles. There might have been helicopters left in Chernobaivka, which had no pilots to pull them out, or had malfunctions that could not be flown with. I think there were transports and old assault vehicles left there. I don't know how many,"" says the commander of one of the Russian units who crossed the Dnieper at night from November 10 to 11.

>According to Ukrainian military estimates, up to a third of the servicemen of the Kherson group of the Russian Armed Forces and up to three-fourths of the military equipment remain on the right bank. We are waiting for exact data as early as November 12.

That already showed that Russia has trouble supplying their troops a few hundred kilometers from their border and that due to their inability to establish logistical lines, any further escalation to neighboring countries is a wet dream, nothing more. 

Remember the wooden cages cobbled together and attached to the top of MBTs to protect them from Javelins because they had no reactive armor? Remember the commercially available Garmin GPS inside the cockpit of the shot down russian fighter jet? The Orlan drone with a likewise commercially available Sony digital camera inside? The tanks towed away by Ukrainian farmers? The woman destroying a russian recon drone with a jar of pickles?

> Russian servicemen! As expected, after the retreat of the main group of Russian army troops from Kherson, Ukraine, your command left you to your own devices. Your commanders urge you to change into civilian clothes and try to escape from Kherson on your own. Obviously, you will not succeed.

> Kherson returns to the control of Ukraine, units of the Armed Forces enter the city. Retreat routes are under fire control of the Ukrainian army. Any attempts to oppose the Armed Forces of Ukraine will be stopped. Every Russian serviceman who resists will be destroyed.
You have the only chance to avoid death—surrender immediately. In case of voluntary surrender, Ukraine guarantees your life and safety.

> It is safe to surrender, you can call the hotline *I want to live* at +38 066 580 34 98 and +38 093 119 29 84 (24/7) or use the chatbot *I want to live*.

*Russians who do not have the opportunity to contact the ""I want to live"" project are given the following instructions for how to surrender:*

> Unbuckle the magazine and hang the weapon on the left shoulder with the barrel down, raise your hands with a white flag (any white cloth will do), shout ""I surrender!"" and approach the Ukrainian military, follow commands, and fulfill all their demands.

*There is also an instruction on how to surrender as part of a group or unit:*

> Put down all weapons and leave, stand in front of your military equipment (before that, silence or turn off any equipment—it should not be in combat mode), send a negotiator (an officer or a senior by rank)—he must be unarmed and have a white flag.

> Citizens of Ukraine from the occupied territories, who were forcibly pressed/mobilized, forced to fight on the side of the Russian Federation, should inform the Ukrainian military about this.

Consider how hard it was for US to hunt Scud Launchers during the Gulf war, even as they ruled the sky:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scud_missile#Scud_hunting

""During the war, while patrolling, strike aircraft managed to sight mobile TELs on 42 occasions, but only eight times the aircraft were able to locate the targets well enough to release their ordnance.[65] In addition, the Iraqi missile units dispersed their Scud TELs and hid them in culverts, wadis, or under highway bridges. They also practiced ""shoot-and-scoot"" tactics, withdrawing the launcher to a hidden location immediately after it had fired, while the launch sequence that usually took 90 minutes was reduced to half an hour. This enabled them to preserve their forces, despite optimistic claims by the coalition. A post-war Pentagon study concluded that **relatively few launchers had been destroyed by coalition aircraft**.""

UK special forces sent to hunt Scuds did not do much better: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_Two_Zero

- continued technology usage development on the battlefield 

- Russian command becoming less stupid (Kherson withdrawal instead of “not one step back”)

- mobiks replacing casualties (the survivors of which, while currently untrained, will become effective soldiers purely by learning battlefield survival)

- China / Turkey / India continuing to purchase Russian energy with no consequences (providing a stream of revenue)

""On a hill at Bomma near the mouth of the Congo dwells Namvulu Vumu, King of the Rain and Storm. Of some of the tribes on the Upper Nile we are told that they have no kings in the common sense; the only persons whom they acknowledge as such are the Kings of the Rain, Mata Kodou, who are credited with the power of giving rain at the proper time, that is, the rainy season. Before the rains begin to fall at the end of March the country is a parched and arid desert; and the cattle, which form the people’s chief wealth, perish for lack of grass. So, when the end of March draws on, each householder betakes himself to the King of the Rain and offers him a cow that he may make the blessed waters of heaven to drip on the brown and withered pastures. If no shower falls, the people assemble and demand that the king shall give them rain; and if the sky still continues cloudless, they rip up his belly, in which he is believed to keep the storms.
  
Among tribes on the outskirts of Abyssinia a similar office exists and has been thus described by an observer: “The priesthood of the Alfai, as he is called by the Barea and Kunama, is a remarkable one; he is believed to be able to make rain. This office formerly existed among the Algeds and appears to be still common to the Nuba negroes. The Alfai of the Barea, who is also consulted by the northern Kunama, lives near Tembadere on a mountain alone with his family. The people bring him tribute in the form of clothes and fruits, and cultivate for him a large field of his own. He is a kind of king, and his office passes by inheritance to his brother or sister’s son. He is supposed to conjure down rain and to drive away the locusts. But if he disappoints the people’s expectation and a great drought arises in the land, the Alfai is stoned to death, and his nearest relations are obliged to cast the first stone at him. ""

The Golden Bough by Sir James George Frazer, Chapter 8. Departmental Kings of Nature.

""The Dinka are a congeries of independent tribes in the valley of the White Nile. They are essentially a pastoral people, passionately devoted to the care of their numerous herds of oxen, though they also keep sheep and goats, and the women cultivate small quantities of millet and sesame. For their crops and above all for their pastures they depend on the regularity of the rains: in seasons of prolonged drought they are said to be reduced to great extremities. Hence the rain-maker is a very important personage among them to this day; indeed the men in authority whom travellers dub chiefs or sheikhs are in fact the actual or potential rain-makers of the tribe or community. Each of them is believed to be animated by the spirit of a great rain-maker, which has come down to him through a succession of rain-makers; and in virtue of this inspiration a successful rain-maker enjoys very great power and is consulted on all important matters. Yet in spite, or rather in virtue, of the high honour in which he is held, no Dinka rain-maker is allowed to die a natural death of sickness or old age; for the Dinka believe that if such an untoward event were to happen, the tribe would suffer from disease and famine, and the herds would not yield their increase. So when a rain-maker feels that he is growing old and infirm, he tells his children that he wishes to die. Among the Agar Dinka a large grave is dug and the rain-maker lies down in it, surrounded by his friends and relatives. From time to time he speaks to the people, recalling the past history of the tribe, reminding them how he has ruled and advised them, and instructing them how they are to act in the future. Then, when he has concluded his admonition, he bids them cover him up. So the earth is thrown down on him as he lies in the grave, and he soon dies of suffocation. Such, with minor variations, appears to be the regular end of the honourable career of a rain-maker in all the Dinka tribes. The Khor-Adar Dinka told Dr. Seligman that when they have dug the grave for their rain-maker they strangle him in his house. The father and paternal uncle of one of Dr. Seligman's informants had both been rain-makers and both had been killed in the most regular and orthodox fashion. Even if a rain-maker is quite young he will be put to death should he seem likely to perish of disease. Further, every precaution is taken to prevent a rain-maker from dying an accidental death, for such an end, though not nearly so serious a matter as death from illness or old age, would be sure to entail sickness on the tribe. As soon as a rain-maker is killed, his valuable spirit is supposed to pass to a suitable successor, whether a son or other near blood relation.""

People might ask, why does the Tsar steal all of our money for healthcare to build palaces, why can't we be like Ukrainians having less corruption and amazing wonders like indoor plumbing?  A peaceful prosperous Ukraine puts a target on Putin's back and calls into question his plans to grind his Russian slave population into dust for his own personal benefit and the benefit of his concubines.  A prosperous, peaceful, west-aligned Ukraine was the threat.  

I think it's that but also simply that Putin has felt perpetually humiliated by the west and has poor emotional control and has been trying to flip the script.  When his Ukrainian puppet and his American puppet went down in flames he couldn't control his little tantrum and tried these wild gambles that instead blew up in his face.  One thing that's certain is all of this has significantly increased the chances of his buttocks having a date with a bayonet.",False,1668177441.0,t3_ys0m4f,t1_ivxz1lf,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

You think Russian society is collectively asking the question “why aren’t we more democratic” and someone has answered “because we are eastern slavs”? This is not a topic of discussion. Older people want order because that’s what they are used to and are traumatised by the fall of the USSR. Young people prefer order because that’s all they know and were taught from the older generations.

Quite frankly as autocratic as Russia is the government wont be an obstacle for 99% of the people living their daily lives. Russian society has never asked this question you think is the basis of Putin’s rule. The ones who are against Putin is not because of his autocratic rule but because they have become westernised and like much of the world romanticise the West and find Western values appealing (for good reason). 

When you live in a democratic country I understand how you might believe Putin is having an autocratic experiment and how the Russians instinctively want democracy. But Russian society is not Western and did not go through the same development stages as the West nor do the people have the exact same values. Democracy is not a universal solution in everyone’s minds and as crazy as it might be to you most Russians wont tell you there is a lack of freedom.",False,1668174503.0,t3_ys0m4f,t1_ivxz1lf,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

Hmm, not sure about how good of idea would be to attempt a ""river"" crossing even if the river is frozen. It would be pretty difficult to do such a complicated maneuver without the Russians knowing about it, and once they know about it, a few rounds of artillery would do a lot of damage to any force attempting to cross it, and as you mentioned would create a real possibility of that force being trapped on the other side of the river with no supply lines once the ice is shattered by artillery.   


So i find the idea of Ukraine attempting a large push across the river to be very much out of the question, even if the river freezes it enough to allow for such an operation. 

I do agree with you that a very cold winter will be extremely detrimental for Russian military operations in Ukraine, while Ukraine, thanks to continuous support from western powers, especially when it comes to the supply of winter equipment, may still be able to continue counter offensive operations during the winter, even if limited in scope than the previous two counter offensives.",False,1668204098.0,t3_ys0m4f,t1_ivzyjtn,,1,13,0,13,0,0,

Tactically? Yes, getting your troops out of a salient and behind a large river with minimal crossings makes a lot of sense, especially when the enemy has artillery zeroed on your supply lines.

Operationally? Almost certainly not. Now Ukraine has the same defensive river to hold behind, their artillery can reach further, and most importantly: Ukraine has (or will soon have) control over Crimea's primary fresh water supply. With the Kerch bridge only partially operable, that could be a disaster.

The big question is, strategically? We still don't really know what Russia's strategic goals here even *are* anymore, because they bungled their previous operations so miserably that the obvious strategic goals (total control of Ukraine, security for their already controlled territories, destabilization of NATO-allied states and the US president in particular) are completely impossible to achieve.

Utilizing high level intelligence and precision munitions along with SOF ground recon and infiltration they identify command and control nodes, transportation and supply hubs, and high value targets of opportunity (radar, anti-air, artillery) they weaken and bleed Frontline Russian units. 

Those units frequently don't have reliable communication, supplies of basic necessities, or artillery/air support and are hit until they become combat ineffective.

This leads to extremely low morale, uncoordinated offensive operations, disjointed and ineffective defense. 

Once forces in an area are whittled down over several months they become combat ineffective and the Russians are either forced to retreat, surrender, or suicide in irrational attacks.

1. Even though the likely result would have been a military success, adding lots of Russian casualties, it would likely have been a civilian disaster - urban fighting tends to be. The Ukrainians, I think, wanted to avoid that. 

2. Urban battles are notoriously casualty-intensive. The urban landscape offers up all sorts of impromptu fortifications. Even though the Ukrainians would certainly win, they could get badly chewed up.

The main reason why Kherson was done so more successfully has to do with the fact that the Russian command knew they had to retreat for weeks already. And were preparing to do so since October.

I also wouldn't put a lot weight on what WiU has to say about the fighting capabilities of the Ukrainian military. His hot takes are often utterly bogus, seriously  one video in early September, WiU criticize the Ukrainian army in Kherson because they were unable to create the success that the Ukrainian army was able to achieve in Kharkiv. What he failed to realize in his bogus analysis was that the army in Kherson was facing a far stronger enemy, and not only that, it was facing an enemy that was actually prepared to meet them, this wasn't the case in Kharkiv where the Russian high command was moving troops out of that front and sending them to Kherson.

WiU is a useful data point, his analysis of the ground situation is fairly accurate, so he's a good source for information about the daily situation in the frontlines, but his hot takes of the big picture in this war are full of his own pre-conceived opinions about the Ukrainian government, its military, as well as its allies.

Instead, they've acted methodically and dispassionately, giving better odds to the overall war effort at the risk of occasionally exposing civilians slightly longer to enemy tyranny in the short term.

They absolutely wouldn't cheer for suffering or death for anyone, but they don't necessarily believe that Ukrainians are suffering as much as they are, or if they do believe it, they resign themselves to deciding that the world isn't fair and it sucks, but that's life. 

Now obviously there's no way to know for sure exactly where those percentages lie, and it may well be more like 30/50/20, or in my view, more like 5/90/5. It's really hard to understand just how fatalistic and head-buried-in-sand Russians are until you've lived in the country for a good length of time. I'm lucky that Petersburg tends much more liberal and in this city, that ratio is probably more like 1/60/39, but even the Putin haters (which is almost every person I know) are not willing to risk their lives or their family's lives to speak out about it. 

Again, you can absolutely judge them for that apathy - call it cowardice, ignorance, or whatever. I agree with you. But I can say for sure that 80% are not happy with death of anyone. Not even close. Russians are not bloodthirsty monsters. They are passive bystanders with chronic Stockholm Syndrome and severe fatalism.",False,1668182538.0,t3_ys0m4f,t1_ivy2y15,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Fair enough.

As for the rest of it, your explanation doesn't make sense. Doctrines can be whatever, but the fact is russia has been the aggressor and Ukraine the defender. Both armies are not doing the same activities & the aggressor acting like russia does takes far more casualties. Furthermore they are fighting on Ukraine's home turf.

I also highly disagree on the doctrine issue. Ukraine doesn't attack head-on without a regard for troops while russia does. While defending Ukraine trades space for time and lives while russia stubbornly holds Kherson until the whole front collapses. The doctrines couldn't be more different.

Take out a tank and infantry loses support for attack/defense causing more casualties, take out artillery and a side loses much of the ability to repel attacks or provide covering fire etc.

If either side were to run out of tanks or artilllery it would significantly reduce their combat ability. NATO won't be able to cover all Ukraine's needs as they simply don't have that much what Ukraine needs. This equipment is invaluable.

Ukrainian doctrine is basically old Soviet with now NATO modifications. Both sides heavily rely on artillery on both attack/defense and mechanized infantry for offensive operations while NATO is all about air superiority and precision missiles.
