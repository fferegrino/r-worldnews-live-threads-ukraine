I was watching sky news about 15 min ago and they interviewed a Ukrainian woman living in Western Europe (can‚Äôt remember the town) who had parents she was in contact with living in Kyiv. She had spoken with her parents 30 min prior to the interview and relayed more or less the following regarding the situation. 

Her parents want to leave but logistically cannot. Their car would run out of gas in the middle of nowhere at night before reaching relative safety. It‚Äôs likely similar for most people there. Everyone the woman has spoken to, her parents included, have heard explosions in varying degrees. ‚ÄúThe windows are rattling‚Äù. The woman also manages a team that lives in Ukraine as a part of her job. They had all said they were willing to fight and were preparing a means to do so. Apparently there* is an arms shortage as rifles are hard to come by and the city has run out where they were giving them to civilians earlier. Her teammates are preparing Molotov cocktails and similar guerrilla style weapons with available materials. They are hunkering down and preparing for an invasion. 

My anecdote, I lived in Ukraine, specifically Kyiv, for 10 years of my childhood but live and have lived in the States since 2005. I‚Äôm equally heartbroken and inspired by what I‚Äôm seeing coming out of Ukraine. I‚Äôve cried many times seeing the places I enjoyed as a kid ruined by war* and at the same time the people are so inspirational. The stories coming out are such a fresh and pure example of people fighting for democracy and personal liberty. Compare that to the last 18 months of propaganda fueled examples of people standing for freedom by refusing to put on a mask and other, equally dramatic and frivolous examples of people making a ‚Äústand‚Äù for freedom. That for me is why seeing President Zelensky stand in the face of tyranny with his people is inspirational, it‚Äôs truly inspiring!

If we were fighting 'along side them', something upwards of 3000 NATO jet fighters would be making around 9000 sorties a day, and killing 30,000 Russians a day.  Serious shit.  Russia's own airforce would take down a good number of aircraft, and their AA would be a serious threat, but would disappear from the skies and ground as quickly as they appeared.

Check out this 1st gulf war video, especially the bits where he shows the orbiting massed formations of aircraft: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxRgfBXn6Mg&t=14m0s

The RAF alone could probably clear russian jets and helicopters from Ukranian airspace (but would have trouble with Russian S400 batteries closer to the front lines, and so wouldn't be able to provide direct ground attack support).

Not as told to us afterwards by some media outlet, not as shown to us through carefully-curated clips and secondhand testimonies, but rather **as it was occurring live**.

Russia has one 5th generation Fighter Jet, the SU-57. They have 5 combat ready SU-57's. The rest of the Russian Air Force has a mix of 4th to 4.5th generation planes. These range from SU-27's to Mig-35's. Don't be fooled by designation of the Mig or SU 35's. They are essentially upgraded versions of the SU-27 and Mig-29.

Their airforce consists of about 600-800 of these fighter jets and multirole jets.

The Ukranian airforce consists of SU-27's and Mig-29's. These have been upgraded as well just not to the extent of the SU-35 and Mig-35. Ukraine has about 200 of these fighter jets and multirole jets.

The fighting ground for these air forces are about even in terms of capability which makes the fighting come down to numbers and pilot talent.

As for ground forces. Russia's mechanized units consist of tanks ranging from the T-72 (upgraded) to the T-90. There are no operational T-14's (a next generation tank).

Russia has about 2800 operational MBT's (main battle tanks) with 16,000 older tanks in reserve.

Ukraine has tanks ranging from the T-64 (upgraded) to the T-84. Of these MBT's Ukraine has roughly 2000.

The leader of Russia's Chechnya region says he has deployed his fighters to Ukraine to join battle with Russian troops.

In a video posted online, Ramzan Kadyrov said Chechen forces had so far successfully captured a Ukrainian military facility without suffering any casualties.

The leader of the southern Russian republic is a key ally of the Russian president.

Justifying the invasion, he says Putin's decision to attack Ukraine will prevent Moscow's enemies from using the country to launch an attack on Russia.

Chechen fighters loyal to Kadyrov have a notorious reputation and stand accused of human rights abuses.

A senior Turkish official has denied that it has closed two key waterways to Russian warships, saying that Ankara is still evaluating its response to a plea from Kyiv to do so.

Ukraine‚Äôs President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Twitter after a phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that the Turkish leader had agreed to prevent Russian naval vessels from transiting the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus straits, which link the Mediterranean to the Black Sea.

But a senior Turkish official told the Financial Times that Ankara was still assessing its position. ‚ÄúThe evaluation of the situation is still under way,‚Äù the official said, adding that Zelensky‚Äôs Twitter message had been misinterpreted.

Abramov is one of Roman Abramovich‚Äôs business partners, and controls a huge amount of Russia‚Äôs steel through industrial giant Evraz.

In 2007, he started picking up interests in the United States. These included Oregon Steel Mills and Claymont Steel.

**Yesterday I wrote a huge text about what is happening on the other side of the barricade. Today I will continue my discussion, because it may be important and useful for someone to understand how it feels to be embroiled in a war that you never wanted, a government that you never chose.Original discussion link --** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t10d3t/rworldnews\_live\_thread\_russian\_invasion\_of/hyd6l6f/?context=3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/t10d3t/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/hyd6l6f/?context=3)Last night, protests took place in all major Russian cities. Even bigger, more bloody than the day before yesterday, as people begin to understand that what happened with Crimea (they came, they met with practically no resistance, since many there really weren‚Äôt against it) definitely won‚Äôt happen. I protested as well.

Many Russian bloggers and journalists yesterday talked to random people on the streets, asking them about their attitude towards the war. Out of a hundred people, only three or four answered that they would go to war if they were called. These men clarified that they are not against Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, but see it as their duty to defend their land in case of counter attacks on the country.In Moscow, a few hours ago, an operation began to prevent uprisings and revolution, as well as sabotage by Russian Ukrainians and any ""sabotage"". Cars moving south are stopped and searched, men are checked for weapons, many corporations have recommended employees to stay at home, explaining this both by the official political agenda and by questions of possible terrorist attacks, as a protest reaction from the Ukrainian community. There are a lot of soldiers with dogs in the subway.The longer this war goes on, the more questions arise.

1. Why and **for what did HE send ""children"", not profi to fight**? A huge number of ordinary military recruits (guys from 18-27 years old) who are required to do military service for 1 year (training) were forcibly transferred to contract military and sent to a hot spot a few months after they first picked up a machine gun or put on a uniform. Russia is full of professional military, but right now they are ""guarding the cities"" and not fighting a foreign war.Do not consider me a cynic, but unprofessionalism, disorganization and a complete lack of fighting spirit (morality), on the one hand, give odds to the Ukrainian people, and on the other hand, they drag out this war, where the number of victims, death and destruction increases every day.Also striking is the strange, outdated weapons that they were given. Russia has much more modern versions of almost everything that they use now, but they are ... hidden? Do not want to demonstrate in a public fight? I don't have any other options yet.
2. The second most bizarre thing is how much they probably **delayed the capture of Kyiv by themselves**. This is not pro-Russian propaganda, of course (because the whole post is about the fact that I do not understand why this is happening). In the morning I spoke with several friends and relatives in Kyiv. Two confirmed that the city could indeed be taken, despite the heroic defense of the Ukrainians. Through bilateral propaganda, information is leaking to them that literally before the assault, someone canceled (postponed) this assault. Why? What for?
3. **Internet and calls.** The very fact that a country that forced shutdowns from the Internet to any neighboring country with protests (and itself) has not disconnected from the Internet the country it seizes for three days, allowing the dissemination of information about movements, propaganda - is shocking (sorry reddit, but propaganda it is always a two-sided distorting mirror and it touches both sides of the war). People from Kyiv call Moscow. People from Moscow call people in Kyiv without problems. Even in a mobile online game, we calmly correspond with the players who are now sitting in a bomb shelter! Are European military conflicts in the 21st century supposed to be like this?
4. **Propaganda.** They write on reddit that Russia is drowned in pro-Russian propaganda and does not understand anything. This is not true. The strangest thing is that there is a feeling that those who should do this propaganda work very poorly (or do not work at all). One particular civilian Ukrainian woman, whose city was attacked was photographed 1000 times from all sides and conditions. They made her a media star, a symbol of this war. The foreign Internet is full of fake news and videos of various military conflicts over the past 10 years. It‚Äôs stated to be Ukraine now, but it‚Äôs not!. From the Russian-language media, even pro-Putin ones, there are practically no slogans, symbols, all the news looks like ""they took this city, the dollar is growing and now the weather for tomorrow."" No one even writes about the Alley of Angels in Donetsk, an obvious and one of the very few rational symbols why a war could have been unleashed at all.

They have literally never been a democracy in their entire history. Not under the Tsar, not under the Bolsheviks, not under the Oligarchs. The average Russian has absolutely no say in their destiny. They wake up every single day shivering in bleak, miserable weather. Nobody has any children - because why would you? - so their demographics are tanking, there is no replacement generation, their entire ethnicity is actually disappearing. 

Everybody understands that things aren't ever going to get better, so the politicians and educated class have no problem siphoning off whatever wealth they have into foreign havens. The average citizen has no better coping mechanism than to do krokodil until their skin falls off and drink so heavily that the men all end up dying in their 60's. We like to make movies and games about sad post apocalyptic societies, without understanding that that's already happening in places like Russia. 

And why is all of this happening? Why all the non-stop, consecutive episodes of misery? Because the country is cursed. Even a non-believer could look at Russia's history and start to believe that, just maybe, the idea of sin and divine punishment were perfectly adequate analogies for what happens when you try to jump-start your society by shooting the Tsar's three perfectly innocent children to death in front of him. Maybe there's something to be said for how founding your country in murder, makes it easy to kill millions of peasants via starvation just as an experiment in collectivism, then shrug your shoulders and say, ""Eh, it was just an experiment.""

My heart literally aches for the people of Ukraine, not figuratively, I literally feel this affecting my heart rate. I always believe that decisions should be made from a logical standpoint not a place of emotion.
Somebody in here just suggested (probably mostly as a joke, but partly serious) that the west should casually misplace military equipment near the Ukrainian border.  I was all for that for a minute, but then I had a red flag pop up in the back of my mind.  The last time we armed an insurgency to fight back against a Russian invasion it was literally the Taliban we were sending munitions to and then we had to fight against our own weapons in Afghanistan.  Now I don't equate Ukraine with a Middle Eastern religious extremist cult, but if we fast forward this 10 years, if Ukraine survives this they're going to come out stronger and prouder than ever. And they're going to be PISSED OFF at America shitting on the Budapest memorandum. TLDR, they gave up their nukes in exchange for our protection and now we're mostly just sending thoughts and prayers.
We did learn from the Taliban fiasco so most military aid we ever send is low tech stuff like guns and bullets and we hold onto the big boom high tech trillions in R&D stuff ourselves so it can't be turned against us decades down the road. There is an opportunity though, Ukraine is screaming for armaments right now and if we actually send more than token support we could have a strong unified Ukraine as an ally for years to come.

Javelins pierce through armor *then* blow up. It's not on first contact. It's why they're getting fucking ripped.

Edit: for those wondering why it looks like chicken wire or fencing, it's due to weight. You don't need anything heavy to initiate the explosive mechanism, you just need something with enough resistance to set off the charge. Same concept of supports in 3d printing to not waste material.

Update from Kyiv

I was watching sky news about 15 min ago and they interviewed a Ukrainian woman living in Western Europe (can‚Äôt remember the town) who had parents she was in contact with living in Kyiv. She had spoken with her parents 30 min prior to the interview and relayed more or less the following regarding the situation. 

Her parents want to leave but logistically cannot. Their car would run out of gas in the middle of nowhere at night before reaching relative safety. It‚Äôs likely similar for most people there. Everyone the woman has spoken to, her parents included, have heard explosions in varying degrees. ‚ÄúThe windows are rattling‚Äù. The woman also manages a team that lives in Ukraine as a part of her job. They had all said they were willing to fight and were preparing a means to do so. Apparently their is an arms shortage as rifles are hard to come by and the city has run out where they were giving them to civilians earlier. Her teammates are preparing Molotov cocktails and similar guerrilla style weapons with available materials. They are hunkering down and preparing for an invasion. 

My anecdote, I lived in Ukraine, specifically Kyiv, for 10 years of my childhood but live and have lived in the States since 2005. I‚Äôm equally heartbroken and inspired by what I‚Äôm seeing coming out of Ukraine. I‚Äôve cried many times seeing the places I enjoyed as a kid ruined by was and at the same time the people are so inspirational. The stories coming out are such a fresh and pure example of people fighting for democracy and personal liberty. Compare that to the last 18 months of propaganda fueled examples of people standing for freedom by refusing to put on a mask and other, equally dramatic and frivolous examples of people making a ‚Äústand‚Äù for freedom. That for me is why seeing President Zelensky stand in the face of tyranny with his people is inspirational, it‚Äôs truly inspiring!",False,1645893262.0,t3_t1zcqi,t1_hyj2mhr,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Attacking Ukraine was *probably not* going to work out for Russia, but it was a geopolitical move that at least had a *small chance* of return to Russian relevance.  When you're losing a game but intend to continue playing, it's important to play the high volatility moves with a *chance* of winning, instead of the safe moves that maximize your expected value but are guaranteed losses.

Russia was once a great empire and is slowly collapsing:

* Population is declining and population pyramid is inverting, leaving both fewer workers compared to the old and fewer men of military age.
* Economy has been stagnating under sanctions since Crimea.
* The one key sector of their economy, petroleum, will become less and less relevant over time with renewables.
* Russia is less and less relevant as a cultural force.
* Diplomatically, their past misdeeds have left them increasingly marginalized and irrelevant.

Going after Ukraine probably doesn't reverse that, but is arguably one of the best ways to try and keep relevance. That is, when all of your moves remaining are bad moves, one might as well make the move that has at least a chance of winning if your opponents screw up.

THREAD 1/7 Intel from a Ukrainian officer about a meeting in Putin‚Äôs lair in Urals. Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days. 

2/7 Russians didn‚Äôt have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can‚Äôt physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do. 

3/7 The next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months ‚Äì if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off. 

4/7 If Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions. 

5/7 Alpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians ‚Äì women and children ‚Äì to sow panic. This is their trump card. 

6/7 Russia‚Äôs whole plan relies on panic ‚Äì that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered. 

7/7 The Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is. Ukraine must stay strong and we must provide assistance!

Editing to add quote from the article: 

""Berlin‚Äôs position, which Germany has defended as a long-standing policy aimed at preventing bloodshed, now means that weapons stockpiled across Europe cannot be sent to Ukraine. German officials have said that the request from Estonia remains under consideration.""

Apparently some weapons require consent from manufacturers, and because Germany (a major manufacturer of weapons currently in Europe) is withholding consent, the weapons are just stockpiled, even though the buyer countries want to send them to Ukraine. Just madness.

So I think, in terms of the regular boots on the ground grunts, you've got some Russian troops that are basically in denial that they are at war at all. And others that have sort of bought into the idea (or at least want to believe the idea) that they are liberating Ukrainians from a tyrannical regime or liberating them from some fringe militia. And others who perhaps don't buy into that idea at all, but still don't really want to fight the average non-uniformed Ukrainian because they *do* see them as a sort of brothers. And in addition to all of this, it was supposed to be all over very quickly - an instant blitz to the capitol and game over. There would be no reason to stop the average Ukrainian from their day to day activities in such a scenario.

And for all of these troops I think the reality that the average Ukrainian hates them for being there and wants them OUT, to the point of taking up arms against them, is a sort of morale shock they aren't quite ready to deal with yet. In addition to miscalculating Ukrainian resolve and fighting strength, Putin seems to have made a major error by assuming the average Russian soldier shares his hardline mindset.",False,1645891059.0,t3_t1zcqi,t1_hyivmut,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Mychajlo Podolak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj, told Reuters news agency Ukraine had prepared a negotiating position but faced unrealistic negotiating conditions from Russia.

""Their comments that we have cancelled negotiations are merely part of their tactics,"" it also said in a statement. ""They seem to want to steer the negotiations into a dead end before they have even begun."" Podolak called for talks to yield a ""fair solution"" in the interests of Ukraine's people and nation-state.

Podolak also criticised Kremlin statements that Russia had suspended its offensive on Friday evening in view of expected negotiations. He said reality had shown this to be a lie. ""The fighting was brutal, with maximum intensity. Precisely because President Volodymyr Selenskyy categorically rejects unacceptable conditions and ultimatums for Ukraine. Only full-fledged negotiations.""

They'll probably take in hundreds of thousands of refugees... again.

They stopped Nord Stream 2 (thank you Green Party by the way!) after stalling it out for months on end - which both seemed like impossible tasks before the election last year.

The head of the German foreign intelligence service had to be extracted by special forces because he delivered vital intelligence in person (the German BND has an extensive HUMINT network in Russia with connections into the highest echelons of power).

But you also have to realize that Germany has a new government in which two of three involved parties ran on a promise to restrict weapons exports to countries involved in conflicts. This new government is actually way more anti-Putin than Merkel IV before it because of the smaller parties involved.

And I'm sorry but Germany stalling a bit on SWIFT is prudent in a situation like this because it risks cutting off the Russian oil and gas supply immediately. It also risks multiple sources of raw materials for the EU market. It's easy to scream for this measure if your country has no connection to Russia. If it could lead to a recession in the biggest European economy (which can cause a domino effect) you should take a second to contemplate what will happen.

Estonia, in particular, had said it wanted to send old howitzers but was prevented from doing so because of Germany‚Äôs refusal to allow the shipment of lethal weapons. Estonia bought the weapons from Finland, which gave its approval, but Germany also has to sign off because it originally sold the howitzers to Finland.

In the first case, the issue is that you're most likely boosting enemy morale when they get victory after victory against outdated stuff. A much more effective way is using overwhelming power from the get-go, to destroy enemy morale and get a victory as soon as possible.

Not enough.  Russia has thousands (plural) of nuclear tipped missiles.  The anti-ballistic-missile systems the US has are to protect themselves from a rogue strike from North Korea - which can't have more than a couple, maybe someday a dozen.

> We need to set a precedent and let other nuclear powers know that just because you are capable, doesnt mean you get free reign to fucking kill anyone you want.

You're right, but at the same time it takes a LOT of time to organize a coalition and get a big game together.  IF we'd intended to openly oppose them, we'd have needed massed formations of forces and aircraft in Europe to begin with.

If we trickle forces of our own in - there's a chance that crazy vlad might lob a single tactical nuke at a staging area or airfield, and then what do you do?  Do you escallate?

The thing with NATO is that being a member - means instant war if you attack one of us.  That's what protects us.  The fact that any adversary of one of our members, knows that it means instant war against all of us, if they attack.  So that prevents a war right from the get go.

Because the strategic stalemate that kept the peace during the cold war is called Mutually Assured Destruction. Neither side is willing to attack the other side because doing so would be suicide on a global scale. 

The thought was that if one side were to develop a system to stop the other side's nukes, they might consider a war winnable, and strike first. So we signed a treaty saying we wouldn't do it.

However, in the 1980s Reagan wanted to exploit a loophole in the treaty that apparently allowed for an orbital defense system using lasers to shoot down missiles. This was called the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) but was commonly referred to as the Star Wars program.  The US spent a ton of money on it, but never got it to work, the Soviet Union collapsed and the US didn't think it was necessary any longer.

However, I. The 2000s as Iran and North Korea began developing ICBM technology the US started thinking the treaty with Russia preventing development of anti ballistic missile defenses needed to be amended to allow for protection against rogue actors. The US wanted Russia to allow it, even offering to Share the technology with Russia, but the talks never went anywhere because key to the system was deploying it on eastern Europe to protect against a possible.launch of an Iranian missile Targeting Western European allies.

Eventually the treaty was abandoned, but neither side has yet claimed to have an operational ABM system capable of taking out nuclear armed ICBMs.",False,1645890647.0,t3_t1zcqi,t1_hyiujoc,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

That was one of the things they wanted to severely restrict after they got elected at the end of last year so thats why this right now is a giant mess.

The helmets weren't meant as an insult but the truth ist that the German government is new and completeley overwhelmed right now.

Putin played them (and Merkel beforehand) like a sucker and repeatedly lied to their faces.

What Germany is doing right now is less about having sympathy for Putin or not wanting to side with the Ukrainians but more about getting caught completely with their pants down and now facing a serious crisis with terrible options on the table (Germany might not have enough gas and oil to get through next winter if they approve the SWIFT sanctions) and they are forced to  abandon or atleast re-think basically large parts of their political identities and what they had believed and promised their voters.

Its nothing in comparison to what the Ukraine and their government is facing but you have to understand that Berlin is in shambles now. Merkel would probably have been able to deal with a crisis like that far better and quicker (even though she is largely to blame for many things as well that went horribly wrong in German politics recently).

2) ID friend or foe system. It‚Äôs a handshake system in which the other aircraft must transmit a certain response.
3) Doppler drive signatures. Jet engine fans and propeller blades and helicopter blades (because they are spinning very fast)  return unique and identifiable radar signatures.

Do you think there is any truth to that? I haven‚Äôt seen much reporting that the units that are invading are any less well armed than expected

It is the question of why they were so armed that remains open and haunts many nowadays. This good weaponry is really there, as well as professional soldiers. You see, without any stupid propaganda like the red threat, Russia is historically the country of ""Lieutenants Dan Taylor"" (that guy whose father was a warrior, grandpa, grandgrandpa and so on). 

But for some reason he chose not to send them to war. Do not give appropriate new weapons. As the commentator rightly noted above, there are rumors that he is hiding something and most likely this is not at all the third world war that Europe is afraid of, this is something for which he needs these weapons and these soldiers right here and now. Obviously, he provokes the iron curtain, the separation of the former Soviet Union countries from the rest of the world. He does it on purpose. It is possible that he is not even against ""losing"" this war, if only to cut off the rest of the territories and people from the West, to deprive them of the opportunity to flee, take money abroad, emigrate.

I wrote yesterday that Russia has an amazing history, where the process of oppression was most often associated not with the enslavement of other nations / religions / races, but with self-oppression, when a white Christian oppresses the same white Christian. It is this fact that makes me (at least for now) be sure that what is happening will not turn into a third world war without the intervention of other countries. He is simply trying to seize as many lands as possible, whose history would confirm these strange processes of oppression, and close himself off from the whole world, closing the entire territory of the former USSR with him.",1645892776.0,1645891911.0,t3_t1zcqi,t1_hyiw47z,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Yup.
And the truth is, Ukraine is in this position because the UK, U.S. and Russia promised Ukraine security if they de-nuclearized.

People aren't talking about that. They aren't talking about how they were screwed over by our country that is now saying ""we don't want to get involved in another war"".

Like, bitch WHAT?! You got yourself involved when you promised Ukraine protection and then turned your backs on them.

If I didn't know better, I could guess it was all a plan from the jump....U.S., U.K. and Russia were making backroom deals without Ukraine.

SMDH. Shsme on the U.S.!!!

We have no problem bombing countries of brown people who can't fight back for our own financial interests. But to get into conflict with a country literally going against democracy and stealing another's freedom? ""We don't want to get involved"".

Because it would provoke a military response between NATO and Russia, and one side would lose. And as stated at the beginning, we assume the nuclear enemy is willing to use their nuclear weapons. 

> to me, MAD means you don't go into a nuclear powers home turf and try and conquer them, but anything else is fair game if needs must.
