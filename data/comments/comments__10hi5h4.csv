Day 331-332 of my updates from Kharkiv.

We had no missile strikes in the past 2 days in Kharkiv, but towns closer to the border were still getting shelled. Today they killed 1 civilian and injured 3 more, including a child, when they hit someone’s house in Kharkiv oblast. Yesterday they also hit a school in Kupiansk with an S-300 missile. They never manage to hit any military targets when they aim at schools, but they continue to do it anyway, simply because they really love destroying schools.

There were no Shahed strikes for quite some time, but yesterday they launched around 4 of them at our cities. Thankfully none of them made it through our air defense this time, it was not nearly enough drones to overwhelm it, and I’m pretty sure they launched them from different directions, so it was only 1-2 drones per launch. Not sure why they would waste them like that, they should know better that unless they launch a group of 10-20 Shaheds at the same time, there’s basically no point in launching them at all.

Yesterday’s Ramstein meeting was honestly pretty weird. It’s understandable that most of the discussions stayed behind the closed doors and not revealed to public, but because of how little of anything was said most media already declared the meeting a failure, and said that no tanks will be delivered. But then our defense minister said that our forces will be starting training on Leopards very soon, which almost certainly means that we will be getting them in the end. So why make a scene out of it in the first place by saying the opposite of the truth? Making it look like there are disagreements between allies when there are none doesn’t really help anyone. Well, there are obviously some disagreements, but this makes it look like much worse than it really is for no reason.

Back in the fall, near the village of Ilyino in the Berdyansk region, a convoy of Russian military equipment came under fire, most likely from HIMARS systems. Consequently, one of the pieces of destroyed equipment was a Russian anti-aircraft missile system.

The destroyed system was then mistakenly identified by Ukraine, due to its resemblance to the S-300 air defense system.  The Russians had brought hundreds to the Zaporozhye region, and use them to bombard the cities and villages of the region every day. 

Recent photographs indicate that the Ukrainian military destroyed a much more significant “trophy.”  The recent data confirm the destruction of the latest Russian S-400 *Triumph* air defense system in the Zaporozhye direction.

The 5P85SM2-01 launcher was identified by military experts by characteristic components and details that are not found in S-300 systems.

In fact, **this is the first ever documented destruction of the S-400** ***Triumph*** **long-range and medium-range air defense system**, which has been in service with the Russian army since 2007. The Russian invaders are very protective of these complexes and tried to the last not to use them in the Ukrainian war.

They really are unparalleled in history of warfare. This is war reporting of a whole new level, a daily dose of 30+ minutes of raw commander's view of battlefields. 

They tell incredibly detailed stories of what Russians are going through at Soledar. We are seeing things we could never gleam from MoD briefings or quick money-shot clips showing things going boom. 

Two-three weeks ago Russians still used unsupported 5-man squads that acted like untrained civilians knowingly walking towards their deaths. Then we started seeing much larger units, suicidal platoons of 40+ that almost looked like the real military, breaking up into nine-man sections and working together, ducking explosions and running into crossfire, ignoring their buddies dropping like flies all around them.

That stopped after about a week. 

Now we're seeing a complete collapse of command and control as well as morale. His latest series of videos show mass ""must report we hold the land to Moscow"" tactics. Madyar's latest series of videos shot in the last 36 hours around Sil show 40+ men waves attempt to occupy the same trench in an open field. They all get pulverized, one after another. Madyar stops counting after 50 dead and they just keep on coming to the same shitty trench littered with half-buried earlier waves. Never a heavy weapon in sight, much less a vehicle. The final video shows yet another lightly-armed platoon take casualties while getting to the trench, then a couple more once they hop in. And then at a 10-minute mark after a couple more shells land in their vicinity, about half the unit runs out of the trench and high-tails it to the nearby woods, where they just aimlessly wander around as airburst shells hit all around. 

The video ends with a catalogue of corpses, and a Ukrainian counter-attack that cleans up the stragglers in the woods. 

I'd never believe such a thing was possible. Just mass human sacrifice.

>  
>The past 12 months has forced European leaders to seriously rethink their approach to national security.  
>  
>If Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has confirmed one thing, it’s that peace on the continent cannot be taken for granted. The status quo – decades of low spending and defense not being a policy priority – cannot continue.  
>  
>This is especially true in Germany, which has for years has spent far less on its military than many of its Western allies but is now reconsidering its approach to defense at home and abroad.  
>  
>Germany’s decision to dig in on sending tanks will likely go down badly with its allies, both in the immediate and long-term.  
>  
>“It’s like acid eroding through layer after layer of trust,” a senior NATO diplomat told CNN on Friday. The diplomat added that Germany’s hesitance could also have a lasting impact on the rest of Europe and potentially push other members of the alliance closer towards the US, even if Germany is reluctant to do so.  
>  
>For all of the criticism of Germany’s hesitance on tanks, Berlin has played a crucial role in supporting Ukraine over the past year. The US and the UK are the only two countries to have delivered more military aid to Kyiv than Germany since the invasion began, according to the Kiel Institute.  
>  
>Germany’s military support for Ukraine has evolved over time. It ditched its longstanding policy of not delivering lethal weapons to conflict zones and recently has stepped up deliveries of heavier equipment to Ukraine, including armored infantry fighting vehicles and Patriot missile defense systems.  
>  
>The government, however, sees tanks as a massive step up from the weaponry it’s delivered to Ukraine so far, and fears that authorizing German tanks to be used against Russia would be seen by Moscow as a significant escalation.  
>  
>Experts say the reticence is partly borne of Berlin’s pragmatic approach to conflict in general, and a relatively timid military posture going back decades, informed by what Scholz himself has described as “the dramatic consequences of two world wars that originated in Germany.”  
>  
>It is often said in diplomatic circles that Germany’s 21st century model for success has been built on three pillars: cheap Chinese labor, cheap Russian energy, and American guarantees of security.  
>  
>Many believe this well-known preference for diplomatic pragmatism and subsequent reluctance to pick sides will mean any defense reforms will be severely limited.  
>  
>One German official told CNN that it will be hard for mainstream politicians to break free from old habits: “They have an inherent skepticism against siding overtly with the USA and a subtle hope that the relationship with Russia can be fixed.”  
>  
>But the security map of Europe has been redrawn, as have the dividing lines in the international diplomacy. Russia’s unprovoked invasion of another country has demonstrated more clearly than ever that moral values are not universal.  
>  
>Germany, Europe’s wealthiest country, has undeniably benefited enormously from its policy of keeping feet in two camps. It is protected by NATO membership while maintaining economic relations with undesirable partners.  
>  
>That policy has been called out and Germany must now decide exactly what kind of voice it wants to have in the current conversation taking place about global security. The decisions it takes in the next few years could play a crucial role defining the security of the entire European continent for decades to come.

>
>*Officials tried to play down the rift. But Germany is still insisting it will not be the country to take the first step alone, for fear of incurring Moscow’s wrath.*
>
>BERLIN — Western defense officials meeting in Germany said on Friday that they had failed to reach an agreement for sending battle tanks to Ukraine, in a setback to Kyiv’s hopes to quickly receive weapons that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called crucial to the next phase of the war.
>
>The officials had hoped to reach agreement on sending advanced, German-made Leopard 2 tanks, which are stocked by many European countries. But Germany has refused to send its own Leopards to Ukraine or to give its approval to other countries to export them, not wanting to be the first to take the step and asking that the United States send its best tank, the M1 Abrams, as well.
>
>Still, American and German officials sought to play down the disagreements, emphasizing that Germany might yet approve sending Leopards to Ukraine. The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, told reporters at Ramstein Air Base that Germany was “a reliable ally, and they’ve been that way for a very, very long time.”
>
>His German counterpart, Boris Pistorius, said his country would begin an inventory of its vehicles, in case of a future deal, and would begin training Ukrainians on how to use the tanks.
>
>German officials insist Berlin is not standing in the way, and have hinted that perhaps other countries, too, have concerns about making that move without a broader coalition.
>
>“There is no unified consensus,” Mr. Pistorius said. “The impression that has occasionally been created that there is a united coalition and that Germany is standing in the way is wrong.”
>
>Mr. Austin and Mr. Pistorius denied there were demands connecting U.S. and German tanks, though they provided no explanation for what was stalling a deal.
>
>“There is no linkage between providing M1s and providing Leopards,” said Mr. Austin, adding that officials at the meeting were “pushing hard” to meet Ukraine’s needs for tanks and armored vehicles. The defense chiefs said that the United States and Germany would both step up training for Ukrainian troops, including on Leopard 2 tanks.
>
>Mr. Pistorius said there was no timeline for a deal on tanks, suggesting it could take days or weeks. Mr. Austin, on the other hand, said the clock was ticking.
>
>**“We have a window of opportunity here, between now and the spring, whenever they commence their counteroffensive,” he said, referring to the expected Russian campaign. “That’s not a lot of time.”**
>
>The lack of agreement was certain to disappoint many in Ukraine, including President Zelensky, who had appealed directly to the officials before the talks began. “Hundreds of thank-yous are not hundreds of tanks,” he said in a video address. “All of us can use thousands of words in discussions, but I cannot use words instead of guns.”

Former German Minister of Defence Lambrecht wasn't agreeing with supplying MBTs to Ukraine and resigned shortly after the decision was taken in NATO/alliance circles without her being able to influence the decision.

She officially resigned 2 days after Challenger 2 announcement. She's member of the more pacifist SPD. She reportedly blocked Bundeswehr from surveying the state of Leopards shortly before her resignation.

New German Minister of Defense Pistorius has been more vocal and seems to be more in favor of Leopards, just going from his rhetoric and overall mood/actions. He stressed, that the decision hasnt been taken yet, but theres no disapproval of tanks. He further stressed the joint movement of NATO/allies in this regard.

Now we're seeing reports from Ukrainian Minister of Defense Reznikov that Leopard 2 training has started, which would be in the same timeline as Challenger 2 training.

Conclusion: Decision has been taken behind closed doors, Lambrecht has been exchanged/removed iot do this properly. We will see Leopard 2s together with Challenger 2s.

People asked me why Germany's @spdde is so obsessively blocking and delaying help for Ukraine...

Well, in the last 20 years the russians invited EVERY male SPD politician to russia for conferences, events, ceremonies, etc. and the russians paid for it all... and all these...

SPD men got the same rooms in the same hotels and totally ""by chance"" met beautiful young women (or men), who adamantly insisted to have sex with these old SPD men in front of the mirror in these exact hotel rooms - naturally with the lights on.

It's that simple.

And it turns out that France has exactly 222 Leclerc tanks. So his theory was that they couldn't spare a single one due to that NATO commitment and having replacements so they always have 200 ready.

I assume it's the same for Germany, but worse given everyone is talking about the poor state of their military. Probably they can only barely field the necessary equipment and this whole fiasco is exposing them.

These countries have to follow german laws. 

So a country who wants to send german weapons equipment, etc to germany has to request the german governemt in paper, what they want to send to whom.

Then the german government has to inform the members of the Bundessicherheitsrat about that request.

These members then have time to check that request and get more information and name people who should be attending the next meeting of the Bundessicherheitsrat, which can speak but not vote.

After some time when all members checked the request there will be a meeting and a vote. This vote is binding and the government has to follow the orders of the Bundessicherheitsrat. After that the german Bundestag has to told about the meeting of the Bundessicherheitsrat.
The government has to inform the country making the request about the decision after.

So the Bundessicherheitsrat can only work reactivly, after a request was  made and this process have to be made for every single request separately.

in June there was a discussion about spain sending leopards, then germany didnt get any request and spain claimed after that the leopards are in an unfit condition and repairing would cost to much.

Poland needed 5 days, if the not named country requesting leopards sending to Ukraine are them, to put up such a request in written form after their government asked publicly and the request arrived yesterday.

So far, Ukraine was mostly on the defensive, using cheaper portable anti tank weapons to destroy unsupported Russian vehicles which was very cost effective vs Russia. They also managed to do large offensive movements without western tanks already. It's doubtful that they would have done more of those with a few Leopards.

So Germany says that “they are not standing in the way” - but at the same time “they are not allowing it”.

I am very annoyed with Germany’s attitude towards this.  They had a chance to show some leadership, but flunked it badly.

The new German defence minister said that “it’s a red, red, red line for them” and that they can’t agree to it “on moral grounds”

So the Russians - who lets be honest have been behaving like Nazis - are going to be supported by Germany, in as much as they are not going to support opposing them - when we know this spring offensive is coming up.

Without these Leopard-2 tanks, there will be a lot more Ukrainian casualties.

The new minister has said they won’t support deployment unless the USA deploys Abrams tanks.

The US were not keen on that - because they know it will create logistical problems for the Ukrainians, as the Abrahms need a lot of support and spares and different fuel.

It would take too long to train Ukrainians on Abram’s maintenance, so it would need putting US troops on the ground - which would be an escalation.

The US could perhaps have a US maintenance depot in Poland.

But really the Germans are in the wrong here to demand it.

I think the other countries should go ahead with their Leopard-2 deployments without Germany’s agreement.

Holding things up is unacceptable.
Germany’s ‘moral position’ is on the wrong side on this one.

Taking a position that will result in giving the Russian Nazi’s an advantage is not morally right.

If Germany cannot be trusted to support such operations, then future NATO equipment sourcing countries may need to be rethought.

Hopefully the German government will change its mind about this.

2. The Ukrainians are dug in and prepared, with uncommitted reserves and no element of surprise to exploit.

I remember people posting here before that if neighboring countries provided staging locations or repair facilities for Ukrainian weapons, it would be equivalent to directly joining the war whereas simply selling weapons and leaving the Ukrainians to do with those as they please wouldn't be.",1674333995.0,1674333773.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j5b9i74,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

In an emergency, how long would it take Germany to produce a nuclear weapon. The rough answer I have heard touted around is a couple of months... You need easy access to raw materials, engineering to a certain level and production capability.


Now, Ukraine might have access to raw materials (as they have nuclear power stations) and they certainly have the engineering capability (the barriers to manufacturing a nuke are surprisingly low). Where they will hit a bottle neck is having the current production capability. You need to be able to enrich uranium in centrifuges... Not something that non-nuclear states tend to have hanging around. How long to build a centrifuge facility??? . How long does the process to enrich uranium take??? Can you do it in secret, without the Russians lobbing a Kaliba missile at it???


THREE. It is incredibly unlikely to the point of incredulity. Without writing a essey... It is not in any countries sovereign interest to ever hand nuclear weapons to another state. I'm real sorry, but Ukraine is living proof of this. What is much more likely is that that Ukraine would be pleced under the NATO nuclear umbrella. That is to say... If someone nukes kyiv, nato responds in kind.


FOUR. If Ukraine somehow magically got a few nukes, Russia would not necessarily back down. In a pure numbers game of 'would you like a game of thermonuclear war', Russia with its serval thousand warheads would win.

The VKS has been reported to be establishing combat air patrols behind the front line where they have been throwing very long ranged R-37 missiles at Ukrainian aircraft.

Reports are that it's becoming a significant problem despite low altitude flying by Ukrainian pilots. It's been attriting the few Ukrainian aircraft that venture near the front.

Low altitude JDAM lofts still require planes to enter the engagement zone of Russian aircraft.

In this kind of fight you don't want to use JDAMs. You also won't really get to use the other HARM modes because they are all shorter ranged modes.

Leopards are readily available from multiple countries in Europe. Only a small number of Abrams are there, as part of American military deployment. So, ready availability is a factor.

Leopards are easier to maintain and repair, and numerous countries bordering Ukraine already have facilities and parts available. Not so for the Abrams.

Easier and faster to train Ukrainians on Leopards, since so many European countries have them. Multiple countries can participate in training separate groups of soldiers/repair/maintenance personnel. Training on Abrams would be a bottleneck.

Yah, that came to mind as well. Personally, my entirely unfounded opinion: I think both party's actions before the war were a mix of pacifistic naivete and pro-business greed (neither of which are necessarily bad in moderation), but each might have had a different balance of the two. One could be so naive as to believe that the old strategy could still work if we returned to it. But, if watching Russia ruin all that economic progress was sufficient to convince one that they were being naive, then they might still want to position themselves to return to business, but not without seeing a change in Russia first.

What we need now is a person in charge that shows and exerts leadership. Sometimes you have to break through resistance, even at a cost. It has been done by German Chancellors in the past. For example Schröder – for all his terrible mistakes especially after his terms – forced through a very big reform of the German social system. In the end it cost him his position. That was brave. He came to the conclusion that this is the only way, and he used up all his political capital to make it happen. Even and especially against very fierce resistance from within his own ranks. His party, the SPD, split in the wake of this crisis, and the party Die Linke has been formed from SPD and PDS elements afterwards.

The individual redditors in these threads are, on the whole, better informed about the war than your average person. But we are also banded together on this page in a unorganized pack, the wise clumped in a mass with dilettantes, the new, the young and uneducated, and let's not forget to add a generous sprinkling of shit-talking trolls and genuinely malignant insincere propagandists reading from a script — just to spice things up.

This creates a breeding ground for misinformation and poorly-thought-out hot takes. 

FFS reddit may be better than most but this information churn is what the internet *does*. The worst ideas that provoke the most emotional responses rise to the surface. We know this by now, at least those of us who have been paying attention, but apparently just knowing this isn't enough to overcome the incessant rip tide that wants to take us out to sea and drown us. It takes a dedicated effort to swim against the current.

That said, OP makes a good point. I personally think a lot of shrewd players are making a much more sophisticated play than we would ever guess, having a lot more information than any of us have, with parts that are public and parts that are not. In that context, even at our most insightful we're gonna miss some shit. 

It's a shame what OP is saying needs to be reiterated daily, sometimes twice a day, but here we are. We're analyzing, teaching and fighting an information war all at the same time. It's ok to be redundant, though, and say the truths over and over. Saying it clearly helps the people just joining us now, and helps the others keep their bearings.

Go back farther to the civil war and even bullet wounds in seemingly minor areas (ie a hand) could lead to amputation and/or death due to infections.

I am of the opinion that it was TOTALLY worth a try. It could have been successful; but the west should have realized around 2010, that it was not working and headed in a bad direction, politically.  Instead of disengaging, the doubled-down, and let Russia abuse their position.  That argument might even be made about 1996-7 or so, with Russian atrocities in Chechnya. But much moreso after 1999 when Putin rose to power.  Germany, of all nations (if they're truly traumatized by their Nazi past), should have recognized this. Rather than letting their elites grow fat on the profits of fascism.

Even the USA remained too dependent on Russia, in their partnership with the ISS. We were absolutely in a situation where we could not pull-out of that partnership, and risked throwing the entire investment away if we had pushed back politically on Russian aggression.  That's not as big of an issue now, near the end of the lifespan of the ISS.  But in 2000, or 2010 when we became dependent on them for crew missions, the USA should absolutely have done something. (develop a replacement crew vehicle that could be launched on Atlas V, or Boeing Delta IV - - and they DID, with the x-37 variant - but that should have had enough funding in the 1990's to become useful, rather than relying on Russia). 

We all fell for Russia's bullshit, and held on to the international relationship too long. But for people to still be hanging on in 2023, well, that's just fucking ridiculous.  It's frankly being very North Korea-like.",1674320915.0,1674320385.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j5aem9u,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

No one's saying the Ukrainians couldn't operate them. But unlike other tanks, it is not made to be maintained in theater, it requires specialized facilities. The US has maybe 10,000ish M1 Abrams, so we would have flexibility in a conflict to either rotate back damaged tanks, or if we felt a large number were required, set up a specialized facility nearby. Neither of those options are very workable in the present conflict; the economics of building a specialized shop for a force of 100-500 Abrams is very non-optimal compared to the US using its requisition dollars to send platforms that the Ukrainians can use and maintain to their full life cycle.

I'm not very familiar with the Leopard 2, but a lot of experts have pointed it out as the tank that best meets Ukraine's needs for this specific conflict. The frustration with the Germans is not that they won't give their own; it is fairly well-understood that the Germans are under-provisioned. The frustration is that Germany has dragged their feet at allowing others who have bought Leopards in the past to provide them to Ukraine.

> We can do almost anything militarily if we have the political will.

Before the elections he was speaking Russian, selling his TV shows and movies to Russia and in general was perceived as potential Russian asset. Shortly before the elections he gave an interview where he said he would like to look into Putin’s eyes and ask him what does he want and reach some consensus. This was perceived by many as hand over of occupied territories including Crimea. It was especially hard to hear for those who fought for these territories since 2014 and for the relatives of those who died. After the elections he started to speak Ukrainian and after first meeting with Putin he returned with so called “Steinmeier formula” which said that occupiers should hold an election and those who they will elect will become part of Ukrainian parliament. It means Kremlin can install whomever they want into Ukrainian parliament. This caused massive protests (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_to_capitulation!) and Zelensky was almost pronounced as Russian asset. And the then the longer he was in office the more his position shifted towards pro-Ukrainian one with its culmination in spring 2021 when he started openly requesting for Ukraine to be accepted into NATO, appointed Zaluzhny, Budanov, Reznikov and many others. And when the war has started he just removed all the doubts from those who still suspected him to be a Russian asset. 

Many of these things happened thanks to the huge pressure from the civil society, protests, etc. So I’d say he is who was pressured to become who he is. And the next after him will be pressured even more if he will suddenly decide to reach “a consensus” with Putin.",1674318506.0,1674318318.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j59w93p,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Giving Ukraine systems like HARM and JDAM gives Ukraine new capability and it also forces Russia to adapt to counter such systems. Those counters make Russia operate differently and less efficiently, but it's not decisive. I recall when it was first discovered that Ukraine was sent the HARM: Everyone who comes out and screams ""game changer"" doesn't know how armies at war think and fight... because the enemy gets a vote, too.

In the case of the HARM, Russia merely practiced discipline on their radar systems' use. They kept radars on briefly and then shut down, allowing other radars to pick up the slack while they moved.

Unless the West is willing to send some very advanced weapons that have been specifically designed to defeat modern Russian air defenses, Ukraine is still locked in an attritional fight. No amount of HARMs are going to change that.

> How does R-37 detect the ukrainian aircraft flying low?

The R-37 is an active radar-guided missile. It is launched from the Mig-31 and Su-35 aircraft. Both of them- and especially the Mig-31- possess powerful radars with look-down, shoot-down capability that allows them to detect low-flying aircraft from a great distance. These systems have been around for over 40 years and the Mig-31 was specifically designed to be able to fire missiles at targets flying near to the ground.

What the VKS does is have these aircraft sit back at high altitude out of range of Ukrainian SAMs. They're capable of detecting aircraft well inside of Ukrainian airspace and due to them firing their missiles at high altitude, the R-37 has a much greater range than anything that the Ukrainians have. The R-37 is guided by the Russian fighter's radar through a datalink, but once the R-37 gets close enough to detect the Ukrainian fighter with its own radar, it goes active and takes over until impact.

> The differences between AA detection coverage and toss bombing are quite thin and thus the favourable terrain must be in play.

When you're dealing with high-flying aircraft with powerful radars, terrain becomes less of a problem. By flying high you can see over mountains and trees that would be a problem for ground-based radars. This is why many countries put radars on [dedicated planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airborne_early_warning_aircraft).",False,1674305036.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j59pigj,,4,6,0,6,0,0,

Prussia had also divided Poland with Russia, and at that time there were also parts of the population in Prussia that were more pro-Russia.  Then we have the Napoleonic Wars and so on.

If this is your take on the Russian military, then you need to study your history. Russia is fighting wars the way that it always fights their wars, and it works roughly half of the time. The other half involves the other side able to grind down the Russian army to such a point that domestic upheaval ends the war.

Russia is trying to rebuild their army. They get a vote in this process, and if they want to spend a year on the strategic defensive while they train one million men to try to storm Ukrainian positions, they can do it. Indeed, there are plenty of warning signs that Russia is planning on using their new army in a brand new large scale offensive sometime later this year.

> ... For GLMRS they never really developed any real counters despite having them on the paper and had to resort into dispersing the stockpiles 

That is the counter to artillery, yes. Dispersal. There is nothing new about this.

> ... damaging their war effort **significantly.**

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I'd say that's a bit of a stretch.

What GMLRS did was destroy Russian logistics and identified command and control points. While satisfying to see its effects, GMLRS biggest success was actually the destruction of the Antonivsky Bridge, and all that did was exacerbate the supply situation of an already critically overextended Russian force.

What Russia did was:

* Disperse their forces, including their supply depots (as you noted). This makes them less efficient, but not critically so.
* Build/purchase abroad artillery shells to replenish those lost. This is where news reports of Russia buying North Korean shells comes in along with reports of brand new Russian shells being used on the front.",1674311981.0,1674310586.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j59v2d1,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

True, but Ukraine's weapons are just as old. 

Russia hasn't exactly been ignoring their systems either. Both the Mig-31 and R-37 have been upgraded over the years to make them more capable.

> I'm sure NATO has a way to counter R-37

NATO's way to counter the R-37 and the Mig-31 is to use AIM-120Ds at extreme range, or to use 5th gen fighters to defeat the radar on Russian aircraft and get close enough to kill them. Or to fire cruise missiles at known Mig-31 bases until those bases cease to exist.

>  It's likely that if F-16s are on the table, that they will come with some counter to R-37.

It's going to be very, very hard for F-16s to take on the Mig-31/Su-35 armed with the R-37 missile:

1. Russia is firing these weapons well inside of Russian territory and are protected by Russian Surface-to-Air Missiles
2. These missiles outrange any missile that the F-16 can carry, though the AIM-120D comes closest. The R-37M has roughly a 110 mile range while the AIM-120D is thought to have a range of about ≈90 miles.
3. The F-16 has a relatively tiny radar, so it would have trouble detecting a Mig-31 out that far anyways.
4. The F-16 will be unable to operate at high altitude due to the presence of Russian SAMs inside Russia that have the range to shoot into Ukrainian airspace.

To beat these, Ukraine will need:

* Airborne early warning aircraft capable to detecting Russian aircraft deep inside Russian airspace.
* SAM suppression that can defeat Russian SAMs
* AIM-120Ds

Ukraine has none of these. They're not going to get the AIM-120D anytime soon, nor are they capable to operating any kind of AWACS- assuming that the west would even give them any. Ukraine might be able to suppress Russian SAMs if they were given enough F-16s, but it'd be a bloodbath and only a temporary victory given the size of the VKS and the number of Russian SAMs they have.",False,1674311491.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j59ualh,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

Like where is the blatant ""no, it wont happen"" ?, only some SPD outliers may voice that, but not actually people in power, as far as I know of. 

Germany is a big arms exporter and that probably won't change. I'm not exactly sure what aspect you mean when you speak of industry. I think the heavy metal industry and some other areas are vanishing or getting smaller and/or more specialized, because of the economical pressure. The most industrious area for companies like ThyssenKrupp and Evonik/Rag was the Ruhr-Area years ago, but that all changed with other emerging markets like China and even Ukraine/Mariupol were producing for less than what the production cost was here. The quality was a bit better, but in a globalized world quality doesnt matter that much, but quantity, if you are familiar with the concept then you know it from blue chip companies that apply that like Amazon, Apple, MCDonalds etc. The German politicans didn't wanna protect that industry against dumping prices from China, so the companies had to sell it or let off workers. So that kinda industry, doesn't really exist anymore, not in the largescale versions it existed a decade or two ago. The area now becomes more and more a service industry, than a production industry. I could see why it may be more difficult to produce for the defense sector now, add supplychain-crisis to it aswell. Not everyone makes the steel you need for tanks and armour plates, it is a bottleneck. 

What Scholz mentioned at the WEF/Davos, the still existing industry sector (mainly chemicals and medicine, BASF), needs to change in a way that they don't use fossil fuels anymore. And that is the big challenge we face. We created and invented chemical methods that rely on machines that rely on gas, and they were made effecient and got optimized a lot. For companies to change that takes time and money, and then it needs to get exported to the world so everyone can get rid of fossil fuels. And some big companies are very resistant to adaptions to their traditions, as the leadership is old and not very innovative, or we wouldn't be even in this situation. They rather look at a post-Putin Russia that lets them trade with them again like they used to.

Germanys reputation is always bad in this conflict, there will be always something that doesnt satisfy people. But the ones who receive the aid will be thankful.

I don't think they've ever claimed that the R-37M was only designed to kill large aircraft at extreme range. That seems to be how the western press sensationalize it, but real life experience show that it can and does engage low-flying Ukrainian aircraft all of the time.

> The VKS has been firing up to six R-37Ms per day during October, and the extremely high speed of the weapon, coupled with very long effective range and a seeker designed for engaging low-altitude targets, makes it particularly difficult to evade.76 The long range of the R-37M, in conjunction with the very high performance and high operating altitude of the Mig-31BM also allows it significant freedom to menace Ukrainian aircraft near the frontlines from outside the range of Ukrainian defences. The VKS has also started employing the R-37M from at least a few of its Su-35S fighters, which not only increases the reach of the latter in combat but may also suggests Russian stocks of the R-37M are in little danger of running out.

However, there are several larger factors in play:

> Any deviation from the status quo into the future means a reduction in US power.

The US get a lot of benefits from being the world currency, but its arguable that those benefits outweigh the disadvantages it faces from being the guarantor of global security, and being far more open when it comes to trade than most large trading blocs, including the EU.  

> Preventing that is their national interest - and I don't blame them for doing what is in theirs. But it's not necessarily in the national interest of others - Europe included. 

Sure, the U.S. does what is in their national interests, but unlike most top dogs in a relationship, the U.S. does look out for the interests of their friends and allies.  We're literally funding a war that is far more in Europe's interests than ours.  If the U.S. wasn't a more benevolent partner than Russia, Ukraine wouldn't be desperately sucking up to the US to avoid getting subsumed by Russia.  If the U.S. wasn't a more benevolent partner than China, then Japan, S. Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and practically every democratic country in Asia wouldn't be trying to partner with the U.S. over their closer neighbor.

> For instance a realpolitik outcome of this will be Germany having a decimated economy that can't make anything profitably, because the cheap Russian gas underpinning it is gone forever. If you're the US you're making a very risky bet allowing them to choose their national interest.

Germany is free to choose to join the Russian bloc.  Belarus did.  Hungary seems to be going down that path.  The U.S. didn't stop them.  What the Ukraine war did was make it so that Germany can't have it both ways.  They can't have cheap Russian gas and free security from America simultaneously, not to mention all of the other advantages that come with being a friend to America.  Russia would be the guarantor of Germany's security, and if you think American security comes with strings attached, try Russia.  Germany has to choose, and they're choosing.  They're free to choose the other way.  Hell, if Germany did join the Russian bloc, it would likely encourage other EU countries to forge a closer relationship with the U.S. unless they also want Russia to be their guarantor of security.  U.S. national interest is benefited whichever way Germany chooses.  That's realpolitik.",1674349747.0,1674349065.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j5clvj2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Every operator of the Leopard tank in Europe will have facilities to repair Leopard tanks to varying degrees. There are no operators in Europe of the Abrams.

Well that is exactly the problem. Even moving the tank to Germany or Poland doesn't repair/overhaul/rebuild the tank. The resources to do this are highly limited.

European armies don't have the gigantic logistical backbone (as in supply chaines for spare parts, available technicians/engineers, delivery times for spare parts, ...) the US can rely on. Most of them have fuck-all and have to contact/ship to the manufacturer.

This works okay for peace times more or less, but even then you have a massive backlog/delivery times if there are workload peaks for the few companies.

.. and now suddenly we don't have peace times. Depots at the different armies are more or less empty due to underfunding, everyone needs spares, experts, etc. and only a really small amount is available. Sure, there are some... but not enough to 'go to war', so to speak. That's the point PuzzleHeadedEnd4966 made.

I guess we're coming from different directions and experiences in this matter.

Edit for /u/EvilMonkeySlayer: There technically are repair/maintenance facilities, but they're already at maximum capacity in peace times with the normal workload. The repair work is largely being done by private companies, not state owned military institutions.

There's no realistic way to quickly upscale this without converting to a war-time economy for a lot of parts.

You can penetrate on this technicality all you want, there still is no realistic way to suddenly have vast amounts of supplies, engineers and facilities appear from thin air for Leopard 2s.",1674336472.0,1674335921.0,t3_10hi5h4,t1_j5bml1r,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

I think without the US underwriting Ukraine, the EU would have sold out most of Eastern Europe.  They would have come to an entirely Russian favored arrangement and have nothing but hope that Russia abided by it, an arrangement which would only be temporary until Russia decided to advance again.
