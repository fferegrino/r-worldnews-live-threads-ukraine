""The ""successes"" of Russian mobilization - refusals, reports, concealment and self-mutilation
April 8, 2022

A unit of Russian special forces with experience in hostilities in Syria, in full, refused to participate in further attempts to storm Mariupol. In the battles against the Armed Forces from April 2 to 4, this unit lost about 30 servicemen. Therefore, in the future, special forces decided not to try their luck.

Recent data on selection for military service in Russia indicate a low level of Russian interest in contract service. According to a report on the results of recruiting in the city of Ekaterinburg, even less than 1% of citizens in reserve agreed to talk about the possibility of signing a contract.

Of the 397 candidates, only 2 agreed to the interview. Refused - 52, did not get in touch - 203, work on 140 candidates is underway.

There is also an extremely low morale of those already mobilized. In particular, on March 7, two PAZ buses with wounded Russian servicemen were sent from the Novoaidar Polyclinic in the direction of Luhansk. It is noted that the vast majority of them have leg injuries. According to doctors, the most probable cause of these injuries is self-mutilation in order to avoid returning to the combat zone.""

 ""Other Russian military sources which I'm not gonna quote even argued that Syrian experience was negative for Russian army. For example, much of their role was convoying Syrian and Irani supply caravans through a flar desert where it's difficult to set up an ambush unnoticed""

 ""In Syria Russians learnt that convoying caravans is easy. Now they try to repeat this Syrian experience in Ukraine. Being used to convoying caravans through desert, they now convoy them through  forests or residential areas. There they get into ambushes and are exterminated""

From CNN's Isil Sariyuce, Jomana Karadsheh, and Masha Angelova

Russia has complained to Turkish officials about the Ukrainian military using drones manufactured in Turkey.

Speaking at a media briefing on Friday, a Turkish official said Ankara had told Moscow that Turkish drone-maker Baykar Technologies is a private company and Ukraine's purchase of the devices had been completed before the war.

According to CNN reporting, Ukrainian officials have been touting Baykar's Bayraktar TB2 drones as one of the most effective weapons in their arsenal.  

Last week, CNN gained rare access to the Baykar production facility in Turkey for an exclusive interview with its chief technology officer, Selcuk Bayraktar.

Bayraktar, who is also the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the drone was ""doing what it was designed to do and upgraded to do.""",False,1649484367.0,t3_tzl30n,t3_tzl30n,,0,40,0,40,0,0,

NATO officials told CNN that discussions about Sweden and Finland joining the bloc have gotten extremely serious since Russia’s invasion.

US senior State Department officials said the matter came up at this week’s NATO foreign ministerial, which was attended by the foreign ministers from Stockholm and Helsinki.

Officials said the discussions underline the extent to which Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion has only served to reinvigorate and unify the NATO alliance — the exact opposite of Putin’s stated goals before the war began.

In the photos from Rob Lee, 2nd guy looks to be carrying an AS Val. Very rare to see them in use, odd rifles and very odd used in 21st Century against an enemy with body armour although their proprietary ammunition does come in an AP variant. 4th guy seems to be wearing a British MTP smock. 

In the photos from the Canadian: VSS Vintorez in the first photo leaning on the helmet, which apart from a nice monocular, also seems to have a GoPro on the side - wonder what's on that? You can see the Vintorez more in the second photo of the row of rifles, looks to be very clean and in good condition. Real mishmash of SVDs in the lineup, quite a few with modified wooden furniture (including cheek risers, all manner of scopes), and in the middle, just behind the camo-painted polymer SVD are a pair of very new SVDMs, the one in all-black and the one in what looks suspiciously like a babypoop paint scheme. Added in edit: Not sure what's under that big green digital camo tarp towards the back, might be a KSVK, might just be another SVD but it looks longer than the rest.

The rifle 2nd from front is interesting, it's another SVD (probably an SVDM) but the stock and handgrip, possibly even the foregrip, look to be taken from another rifle entirely, possibly an Osiris? They definitely don't match and something weird is going on where the stock joins the receiver.

Today / 10 : 00 ID: 62507c404909af00134b6867

The forty-fourth day of the heroic opposition of the Ukrainian people to the Russian military invasion continues.
The armed forces of the Russian Federation continue to conduct a full-scale armed aggression against Ukraine. The enemy is being prepared for an offensive in the east of our country.
The Russian occupiers continue to destroy civilian infrastructure by launching missile and artillery strikes at railway junctions and roads, stations, residential areas and evacuation sites of civilians from areas of hostilities.
In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, the enemy continues to increase the number of troops.
The occupiers did not abandon attempts at offensive in the direction of Popasna and Severodonetsk. They are not successful.
In the direction of Pivdennobuzhsky, the enemy fought in the area of ​​the settlement of Oleksandrivka. He tried to carry out fire in order to inflict damage on units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the area. He did not reach the goal.
In the Slobozhansky direction, the enemy continued to blockade the city of Kharkiv, shelling residential neighborhoods using artillery, including multiple rocket launchers and large-caliber mortars.
The occupiers completely withdrew their troops from the Sumy region to the Russian Federation.
The enemy has significant problems with the recruitment of military units that suffered significant losses during hostilities in Ukraine. According to available information, more than 80 percent of the personnel of some units involved in the war do not want to take part in further hostilities. The commanders of the occupying forces of the occupiers forbade the release of servicemen whose contracts had expired before the end of the so-called ""special military operation"".
In the temporarily occupied territories, the enemy continues to violate international humanitarian law by committing illegal acts against civilians, including looting, theft of vehicles and detention of Ukrainian citizens.
The occupying authorities in the temporarily occupied territory of Donetsk region have received instructions from Russian curators to return to these territories people who left for the Russian Federation in January-February 2022. According to the instructions of local administrations, citizens must return to the settlements at the place of registration / residence after two months of stay in Russia.
Ukraine's defense forces successfully repel enemy attacks in all directions, inflict losses on the enemy and are ready for any changes in the operational situation.

This was announced in an interview with CNN by the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major General Kirill Budanov.

""They plan to attack Kharkiv in the first place. They will try to finish the city of Mariupol and only after that they can try to attack Kyiv on their own initiative, ”he said.

In addition, to compensate for its significant losses in Ukraine, the Russian army is transferring additional troops to Belgorod (Russia), from where it will redeploy them to Kharkiv region.

According to the head of Ukrainian intelligence, the weaknesses of the Russian army were revealed in the war against Ukraine. They had big problems with the offensive due to difficulties in logistics, and in the area of ​​Kiev, the occupiers were severely defeated.

The head of the GUR of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine informed that the war continues and Ukraine needs serious military support from the allies so that our soldiers can more effectively resist Russian aggression.

“Ukraine will always be grateful for this to Boris and Britain,” Zelensky said. 

Johnson met with Zelensky in a surprise Saturday visit to Kyiv to outline the UK's plan to provide further financial and military support. 

UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss tweeted the UK is sending additional “lethal aid” to Ukraine, including 120 more armored vehicles; new anti-ship missile systems; and $130 million in high-grade military equipment.

They seem to think that it will be some time before the Russian units will be capable of making another meaningful thrust to penetrate the Ukrainian defenses, and they are also very skeptical that any of the worn-down units being transferred from the north will make a significant difference in the near term.

Bottom line - for now, the danger of the Russian advance from Izyum trying to break out and get behind the Ukrainian forces in the Donbas seems to have passed.

Day 45 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today my district was pretty quiet again, but shelling elsewhere still continues, especially around Saltivka. Also Russians started dropping some [weird parachute bombs](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/u00pso/parachute_bombs_began_to_be_dropped_on_kharkiv/) in Kharkiv, not sure why they started using them, but this is the first time they were seen during this war.

Russian soldiers really don’t give Russia any chance to deny their war crimes, do they? It’s like they are in competition for the worst war crime imaginable. What THAT soldier did that was posted all day today (including in this thread and on twitter) is just insane, why the fuck would he film his crimes and post them online, is he braindead? 

At this point they can’t deny anything that happened in any of the occupied territories, their army is literally posting videos of their war crimes. Just how much lower can they go? Each day the stuff that we see coming from Russians just gets worse and worse, just imagine the shitshow if every Russian soldier had a phone to record their atrocities with. Thank god I didn’t see the video itself, the summary that people wrote was horrible enough.

Update: Apparently those weird parachute bombs are a type of heatseeking cluster munitions (9M55K1) fired from a Smerch, that seeks targets while it glides down, so that sucks, they seem really dangerous.

The Vice-Speaker of the State Duma made a proposal to extend the local state holidays (May holidays - the equivalent of a conditional golden week) by a couple of days, and he did it this way:

“It's spring and soon we will have a planting season! Don’t worry, not THOSE plantings, but the planting of vegetables”

For non-Russian speakers, let me explain: 

posadka=planting means both agricultural work and slang for imprisonment in Russian. 
Literally planting in a cell/ labor camp.

""We're at war with a fraternal nation where every 3rd person has relatives in Russia, our main political ally is Eritrea, and the Vice Speaker of the State Duma jokes about gulag right from the political podium and (surprise) no one laughs, only twitches and swallows nervously.""

""""Analogovnet"" - Russian shipyards stop the production of ships due to lack of foreign components


April 9, 2022

The Russian shipyards are in a critical situation regarding the implementation of existing contracts for the construction and maintenance of warships. Reasons: difficult financial situation and lack of foreign components.

In particular, JSC ""Eastern Shipyard"" (Vladivostok) must fulfill government orders totaling 35 billion rubles. Including construction and supply of two sea tankers, two small missile ships, two mobile sea berths, repair and maintenance of ships and boats of various types.

However, from the letter of the military representative of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation it becomes clear that at the beginning of April 2022 due to the difficult financial situation all work was suspended. Staff are being laid off and contracts are being broken. It is the companies that are preparing for the beginning of the bankruptcy procedure.

The next letter from the military representative indicates a total lack of foreign components to continue work on the construction of warships and systems for them. The list of equipment whose production had to be stopped, in particular, includes steering columns, navigation systems, radio stations. The authors of the letter report that it is impossible to find Russian or Asian substitutes for imported components.

The production of powder charges for naval artillery was also stopped due to the lack of foreign components and the lack of Russian analogues.

It is obvious that the Russian military-industrial complex remains dependent on imported high technologies. Without the supply of which Russia is unable to continue production of modern weapons.""

First, there's Ukrainian Intelligence saying that Russian shipyards have stopped production due to sanctions. Also Russian powder charges are no longer being produced either. 

Then there's the propaganda from Russia saying the bridges to Crimea are fake mined. 

It's a bit of a stretch, but Russia might have to pull their Navy out of Crimea to protect it from irreplaceable damage. Especially since their ship ammo is no longer being produced.

> The BBC reports that the Southern Military District will now be in charge of the operation in Ukraine. This makes sense for a few reasons: 

> 1. Its commander, Army General Alexander Dvornikov, outranks the other district commanders who are Colonel-Generals.

> 2. Dvornikov has also been the commander of his district the longest, since 2016, and the Donbas is a priority for that district. This also makes sense because the focus of Russia's operation is now on S/SE Ukraine, which has been the Southern Military District's responsibility

> 3. I think the Western official is wrong to focus on Dvornikov's time in Syria. All of the district commanders commanded Russian forces in Syria, and [other military district commanders] Zhuravlyov and Chayko both commanded forces there twice and have more experience in Syria.

> 4. [Quoting Michael Kofman] The question is what will the command structure look like. Will Dvornikov be coordinating it from [his Southern] district’s joint strategic command? Is it staffed to manage an operation of this size with a significant part staged from Western MD [i.e. forces withdrawn from Kyiv/Chernihiv front]? Or will they create a new command layer?

In a Facebook post, Denisova alleged that an 11-year-old boy was raped by Russians in front of his mother who was tied to a chair and forced to watch as it happened in the Ukrainian city of Bucha.

“The level of brutality of the army of terrorists and executioners of the Russian Federation knows no bounds – raped children …,” wrote Denisova, who has been appointed by the Ukrainian parliament to monitor human rights abuses.

Also in Bucha, Denisova wrote, a 14-year-old girl became pregnant after she was allegedly raped by five Russian soldiers, and a 20-year-old woman was raped by three Russians “in all possible ways at once” in the city of Irpen.

“There is no place on earth or in hell where racist criminals can hide from retribution!” Denisova wrote, adding that rape is strictly banned by Article 27 of the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.

Denisova also urged the UN Commission for Investigation Human Rights Violations to take into account “these facts of Russian war crimes in Ukraine.”

“The racist occupiers must bear the strictest responsibility!” she said.

They have a president and generals that rose to those positions on merit. They learn and think and listen and question. They empower their military and their people to take bold action...and damn the Ukrainian people are fierce.

Then there is Russia, which has done a fantastic job funneling funds into yachts. Promoting the least capable instead of the most to insure the military is run by idiots who could never threaten the kleptocracy.

Thus, the indicator of external irradiation (gamma background) in the measurement sites was 3.2 - 4 μSv / h (microsieverts per hour), which is 10-15 times higher than normal.

One of the indicators that forms the internal radiation received by the occupiers from the soil surface (beta-contamination) in the places of measurement was 90 Sr - 160 times more than normal.

Another factor of internal radiation is alpha pollution, which is formed as a result of fragments of irradiated nuclear fuel, graphite masonry, etc. scattered in this part of the Red Forest. These fragments are now located at a depth of 40-80 cm, but the occupiers dug deeper, according to Energoatom.

“When ingested, this type of radiation has tens and hundreds of times more powerful effects than gamma and beta radiation. Consequently, all the occupiers, who were based and dug in the Red Forest for almost 30 days, will suffer from radiation sickness of various degrees of severity , ""the statement reads.”

Longer read on the upcoming Donbas War:

*In the coming days the JFO is destined to become the focus of Russian attention. Having seized a land corridor from Rostov to Kherson, Russian forces are preparing to punch northwards to cut off lines of supply to Donetsk. Further Russian units – some newly formed and some repositioned – are forming up to push south around Luhansk from Kharkiv to complete the encirclement.*

*The battle will be very different from the advance on Kyiv. Russian units at the beginning of the war were not ready or supplied for heavy fighting. Now the Russians appreciate what they are up against and with only two axes to support can concentrate their supplies. Russian air defences have good coverage over the Donbas and they will likely be able to bring significant air power to bear. Combined with their advantage in artillery, and the fact that the fighting will be in the countryside rather than into urban centres, Ukrainian troops will need to manoeuvre to survive.*

The Srebrenica genocide saw over 8000 indigenous European Slavic Muslims(Bosniaks) murdered by the Bosnian Serb army, Serb army, Serbian paramilitary, Greek and Russian volunteers. More than 8000 civilian men and boys were brutally and systematically executed during the course of 3 days. That is an achievement in and of itself. In places like Prijedor, Vlasenica, Visegrad, Foca, Bijeljina and so forth, genocide also took place by any parameters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre

The infamous white Z symbol that Russian forces use on their vehicles are a textbook play from the Bosnian Serbs who painted every Serb-owned house in certain colors, to mark that those properties would be spared from destruction or to be owned by incoming Serb families in the future.

Systematic killings and rape of civilians were the norm for Bosnian Serb soldiers and paramilitary during the Bosnian war. The images we saw from Bucha a few days ago could easily have been taken in Bijeljina in 1992 after Arkan's paramilitary indiscriminately killed non-Serb civilians on the streets of that town, bordering Serbia to its north. Of course the war would get many times uglier throughout its course, culminating in the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. I hope history does not repeat itself in Ukraine. It seems headed in that direction, considering the footage we got from Bucha. However Bosnia was under a weapons embargo during the war, Ukraine is not. Equipment can flow in via bordering NATO nations. Bosniaks had the displeasure of being one of the few ethnically European population groups that happen to be muslim, which realistically impacted the level of neglect seen from the rest of Europe at the time. Also, today we have social media, instant uploads, camera phones, and most of the world knows what Putin and Russia are capable of. We will not see the scale of systematic civilian killings, rape camps, torture camps to the level of Bosnia, but what we are seeing are indiscriminate shellings targeting civilians in a less direct, but as lethal manner. Bucha definitely brings chills down my spine because those pictures could easily have been taken in early 92 and the first killing sprees by Bosnian Serb soldiers.",1649510441.0,1649510344.0,t3_tzl30n,t3_tzl30n,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

Conventional wisdom, pushed by US intelligence, usually goes that the Kremlin legitimately expected ordinary Ukrainian citizens to welcome their troops with open arms, and only shifted gears once they realized it wasn’t working out. It seemed plausible and explained Russia’s military’s failures very well. 

But something about with it never quite made full sense to me, and with it becoming increasingly clear that the Kremlin was in fact expecting massive political, civilian, and likely military casualties even all the way from Day One like the mass graves, missiles pointed at city centers, mobile crematoriums, field hospitals, etc. as well as the ease and speed at which Putin seemingly shifted those gears of his plan—from the attempted takeover of an independent nation using brutal violence as a tool simply because of the fact that it usually works, to an operation with very strategic, dedicated aims of the ultimate total annihilation of everything Ukraine and Ukrainians, beyond what we’ve seen even in places like Chechnya or Georgia—I think the uncomfortable reality is that Putin already had plans for his genocide in the back of his mind for a long time now, and Zelensky’s refusal to capitulate **didn’t cause** them but **simply accelerated** them.

Honestly, I think that the top men in the Kremlin were probably counting on the Moscow-backed politicians behind Kyiv’s reported ill-fated shadow coup, to help keep the order in Ukraine and prevent chaos from different units in the Russian Army, Rosgvardia, et al. sent into the country relying on only being told parts of the plan (and with some being given different intel than others), in the time period before the invasion, as well as having the current people in Ukrainian government killed and shutting off as much aid from the West/NATO as possible.

And why would Putin come up with such a contrived plan? Because the top Kremlin officials knew their endgame—actual genocide—was so morally reprehensible that if more people knew about it, they’d be met with too much opposition to make it work. In fact, I suspect that just like the “special operation” charade for the purpose of tricking the Kremlin’s domestic audience, the Kremlin never legitimately believed the “common folk” in Ukraine would actually welcome the Russian presence. It was just a lie told to some of the invasion forces.

Also, as a quick side note, I’m about 99.9% sure that Putin knows a lot more about how his invasion is going than certain Western officials are making him out to. Edit: also yes, they underestimated the sheer strength of the UAF.",1649505202.0,1649504266.0,t3_tzl30n,t3_tzl30n,,0,4,0,4,0,0,

I think if there was enough popular opposition in Russia to stop this war, it would have already happened.  

So protect yourself.  

As for the rest of the world: We got this.  Ukraine will win.  Russia will lose. End of story.  The only thing Russia can do to even pretend to deter western allies from helping Ukraine, is to try to attack us. And if Russia does that, it will be the end of Russia.  And if Russia does not attack western allies, they're going to lose this war anyway. The sooner Russia withdraws the better.

So I'm not going to encourage war dissenters to sacrifice themselves to get murdered by their authoritarian regime. Especially when it's not really going to make a difference in the long run.

What I *would* encourage, is to GTFO of Russia.  If you have combat experience and are male between 16-50; go sign up to help defend Ukraine, or help refugees. But just leave Russia, because things aren't going to get better there until this regime is kicked out, and until all the collaborators and puppets of this regime are also removed from any position where they have power to do more harm.

Russian military propaganda channels are starting to release visuals from inside the port of Mariupol where they claim a mopping-up operation is about to end. The port was one of two main areas of Ukrainian resistance in the city thoroughly destroyed after weeks of hostilities.

Cobalt-60's main emission is a beta particle - which probably would not penetrate whatever container it's in. Unfortunately, that decays it to Nickel 60; which will emit two high energy gamma rays. Which will go through even several inches of lead. 

So it doesn't really matter if he picked it up with his bare hand. Just being close to it; he was exposed to quite a bit of gamma. This substance is commonly used as a radiation source for treating cancer patients.  To give an idea of how powerful it is.

I can see how someone might process and label this as “another Russian horror”.

I don’t think we’re desensitised exactly (at least, not all of us), but I think many people are operating from a kind of moral script where we feel we’re doing something useful by ‘bearing witness’ and judging the Russian horrors. Maybe we are — that’s certainly one of the lessons that came out of the Holocaust - don’t shy away from the horror, watch the footage and read the testimonials and realise what happened, and then be *angry* and *appalled*, so this never happens again. So we might think that by seeing this stuff and being appalled and angry we’re avoiding apathy and contributing towards a political environment where stuff gets done.

But child abuse - while maybe marginally less grievous than murder - has a different status when it comes to observation of the act. We think of observation as a kind of complicity or endorsement or continuation of the act, in a way we don’t for eg watching Russians murder civilians.

However if a radioactive emitting particle gets into the lungs then there is no protection from the very strongly ionizing alpha particles. You will likely suffer damage to the DNA of the cells of the lungs which will likely manifest itself as cancer.

This is way radon gas in the basements of buildings is such a big concern. You can easily breathe the radon into your lungs then at some points in its decay process an alpha particle is emitted directly into your lungs where there is little defence.

And that's in Delaware county, I don't venture there are could only tell you what the Rich suburbanites in Powell area think (support Ukraine) and not the people in the rural area.  Amongst the immigrants at my kids school there's support but it's a lot more bitter, a lot more sad, and I guess that reflects to there parents complicated feelings.

There are a lot of refugees at my kid's school.  A few people even walked from Guatemala, some kids parents grew up in refuge camps in Kenya.  One or two families fled area where Putin's thugs are at in Africa.

Now being critical of Biden because they disagree with some or all of his moves, yeah that’s part of trying to dominate in the midterms, but supporting Ukraine is very mainstream in America across both parties.  The fringe is the part that is against Ukraine (liberal and conservative for different reasons) or you get people that really just want the war over so it doesn’t escalate into more military spending and troops overseas (libertarian and socialist leaning folks - Bernie voted agains defense spending increase for instance).  

I kinda land in the latter group (not a Republican though), not stopping funding but rhetoric about not removing sanctions until Putin is gone is exactly how Ukraine doesn’t feel empowered to negotiate for peace on its own terms and it gets drawn out longer than necessary.  I hope they win every inch back but if they decided they could save 100k lives and years of rebuilding by making a peace on their own terms, I fully support that.",1649532438.0,1649532144.0,t3_tzl30n,t1_i42h3le,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

There are conservatives that support Ukraine, but more in the lens of using this as an opportunity to beat in a global rival, and strengthen our economic independence. Elon Musk is a great example, he sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine not only help the Ukrainians, but Starlink's performance also got the US military interested in it.

That attack had global ramifications, including shutting down one of the largest worldwide shipping countries in the world(and among other countries infected they were lucky enough to only hit New Jersey companies in the states).  They had also disrupted every olympics they were banned from for being cheating fucknuts.

The Ukraine cyber attack was so deep it shut down public transportation and all bank transactions. Should NATO have prepared better and faster weaponry then? Well, NATO doesn't really do that. USA, Canada, Israel, and the UK all did plan for it to an extenet, and more importantly agreed about freezing Russian ability to trade money with the world. This has been one of the biggest blows against them.

As for preparing faster to use newer weaponry, it's Russia. The last cold war ended when USA found out the union was all but in the stone ages and buiding copies, rather than advancing everything.  Between that, and an extreme wariness towards an actual war, what could be offered without obvious incident was pretty mediocre. If you'd recall, there has been an awful lot of training exercises by allies over Poland, Norway, and the like. But even those only happened after the Russian tourist should down a passenger plane of dutch citizens. While USA has many things to deal with to justify another visit to a country, even Canada has a great group of guys just hanging out at the border totally not training volunteers before they go in.

Finally, there's been such a long standing worry and dare I say expectation for China to try to take back their capital (as Taiwan is the de facto capital of China and the rest of China are just rebellious and refuse to accept it). I really felt like Russia wanted China to do the same, especially after what they did with Hong Kong, but have been wholesale shut down.

In the end, Russia is attacking a country that was already about half pro-Russian, but the reasons and how well it is going is so lame that even their state news broadcasts aren't enough to unify the people as neeeded.  The reason was that Ukraine had a democratic election, and the dude that was elected was a comedian who made fun of the Russian instilled officials. Turns out that comedian also has the balls to stand and fight for his country.

Finally, on the Ukrainian side, the Russians literally committed the Holodomor towards them, which if you aren't aware it's where the USSR was made over something and their solution was to take every single grown crop from Ukraine and distribute it elsewhere. I know what you're thinking, it can't be every single one, or maybe they didn't have that much to begin with? Nah fam, there was an abundance, all were stolen, 3.5 to 7 million people were starved to death. Many countries still don't denounce it as the genocide it was.

Even lacking as strong a military as they would need to stand against Russia, which is ridiculous, most would just get in the way. Those that stay to fight are fighting like rats, no hold bars.... and yet the recent vid I saw about Ukrainian forces murdering Russian prisoners were actually Georgian, who have a whole other level of hatred.

(EDIT: Also depends on what they can reveal publicly without unintentionally revealing classified intel sources.

 >Flag of convenience (FOC) is a business practice whereby a ship's owners register a merchant ship in a ship register of a country other than that of the ship's owners, and the ship flies the civil ensign of that country, called the flag state. The term is often used pejoratively, and although common, the practice is sometimes regarded as contentious. Each merchant ship is required by international law to be registered in a registry created by a country, and a ship is subject to the laws of that country, which are used also if the ship is involved in a case under admiralty law.

 >A loitering munition (also known as a suicide drone or kamikaze drone) is a weapon system category in which the munition loiters (waits passively) around the target area for some time and attacks only once a target is located. Loitering munitions enable faster reaction times against concealed or hidden targets that emerge for short periods without placing high-value platforms close to the target area, and also allow more selective targeting as the attack can easily be aborted. Loitering munitions fit in the niche between cruise missiles and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), sharing characteristics with both.

This could have an impact on how much aid America is willing to provide.  This could also change American will to deal with price increases or other issues caused by sanctions and build support among some to reduce those sanctions.  All of which could affect a war between European countries.

Also I would point out that while it is a war between European countries, there is some amount of historic precedent to indicate that someties wars between European countries can escalate and involve America.

1. The Ukrainians by default are maintaining a defensive stance in their operations. Even in their counter offensives they fire, maneuver, dig in, and pretty much wait for the Russians to engage them just like how the US Marines did the same thing with the Japanese. Russian Command just can't stop ordering attacks that shouldn't be attempted and it's annihilated Russian combat units.

2. The Ukrainians are well supplied and have made a concerted effort to provide professional first aid and escalated medical attention to their wounded. Chances are there are guys who were wounded last month who are back out there fighting. The Russians on the other hand not only possess little in the way of first aid, they don't even police up their dead. With the exception of officers Russian soldiers die in droves.

3. Russian military operations that are successful appear to entail their cruise missile strikes on military infrastructure and civilian targets. The latter there not only has nothing to do with impacting Ukrainian capabilities, it only emboldens Ukrainian resistance.

Basically Imran has been snubbed by Biden, for many reasons, and he has felt that sting personally. Also, as a Oxford educated former playboy who is constantly attacked for being too Westernized, he has been trying to burnish his Islamic/Islamist chops by championing the cause of condemning Islamophobia and fashioning himself as an international leader who is on a charm offensive to convince the West that blasphemy against the prophet shouldn't be condoned and hurts the sentiment of Muslims arounds the world. In the absence of being deprived of any other international relevance or importance, he has positioned himself as the brand leader and Muslim ambassador on this particular issue on various international fora like the UN and OIC. Now before Putin started his Ukraine war, he knew he would be short of allies and about a month or so before the invasion, the guy who had committed Grozny in Chechnya and otherwise considered Muslims as cockroaches, suddenly discovered a love for the prophet and made a statement (that got a lot of traction in the Muslim world) about how awful it is that Western leaders promote/tolerate blasphemy of the Prophet Muhammed. It was a lame attempt to drive a wedge between the Muslim world and the West, weak as the attempt was. Imran who has been mostly shunned and ignored by the West leapt at this opportunity of being relevant and immediately called Putin. Putin very warmly invited Imran to come to Russia on a state visit on exactly the date he had set to launch the Ukraine invasion. He was going to use Imran as an example of a national leader that was there to make new alliances with Russia at the exact time he knew he would be feeling the heat and international isolation from the West. This would be a great prop for domestic audiences. New countries seeking out alliances with Russia and business as usual in statecraft was the optics he wanted to project to his domestic audience while bombs had started to rain down on Ukraine. The trip was organized with unprecedented haste and Imran Khan was supposed to go on a full state visit of Russia in just a month from then. Little did Imran know that his visit would come on the date Putin had decided to launch the invasion of Ukraine. Putin recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk 2 days before the visit, and the day Imran khan landed, his invasion had started. There was a lot of angst in Pakistani diplomatic circles to postpone/cancel the trip or to cut it short once Imran was there but Imran carried on regardless. It was extremely embarrassing to be used as a prop in Putin's chessboard but Imran had committed to this too deeply and his ego wouldn't let him course correct. As a result, Pakistan got inadvertently inserted into an international crisis and the grand plans Imran had to appear relevant and show up the Americans for ignoring him, lead to nothing but embarrassment in the moment. Furthermore, in the immediate aftermath the European Union upbraided Pakistan for their supposed show of support for Russia and pretty much Pakistan had egg on their face from all sides. Imran had been mortally wounded both domestically and internationally by what he had imagined would be his greatest diplomatic masterpiece.

 >The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy. The equation was formulated in 1961 by Frank Drake, not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the first scientific meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. It is more properly thought of as an approximation than as a serious attempt to determine a precise number.

They've mobilized over 120,000 territorial guard personnel, and they are receiving an enormous volume of military assistance and they are beginning to receive the more advanced and heavy weaponry they need to successfully repel the Russians. As more and more Russian atrocities are uncovered, Western reluctance to hand over advanced weaponry is easing. 

The real question is what losses are the Russian military prepared to accept.

 >The Toyota War (Arabic: حرب تويوتا, romanized: Ḥarb Tūyūtā, French: Guerre des Toyota) or Great Toyota War was the last phase of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, which took place in 1987 in Northern Chad and on the Libyan–Chadian border. It takes its name from the Toyota pickup trucks used, primarily the Toyota Hilux and the Toyota Land Cruiser, to provide mobility for the Chadian troops as they fought against the Libyans, and as technicals. The 1987 war resulted in a heavy defeat for Libya, which, according to American sources, lost one tenth of its army, with 7,500 men killed and US$1. 5 billion worth of military equipment destroyed or captured.

Trade builds interdependence, it builds mutual interest, it builds vulnerability. Soviet era USSR had extremely strong high tech heavy industry, chemical, electronics, rocketry etc. Not as good as America but second only to America. But for the last 20 years we have been actively trading with them, encouraging them to specialize in petrochemicals and to rely on imports for everything else. When they sell oil to Germany they get a bunch of euros which are only useful for buying shit Germany (or France etc.) makes. They buy a nice Mercedes. Each euro sold hurts the Soviet legacy car industry, manufacturing industry etc. They buy German, not Russian.

Mutual trade is the whole basis for postwar peace in Europe, we bind them together to make war so stupidly self destructive nobody would ever do it. For 20 years they’ve taken our money without recognizing the strings that came with it. Everyone plays nice and everyone gets rich.

It turns out Russia is sufficiently stupid to break the rules but that doesn’t mean that the trade was a bad idea. They have fucked around and soon they will find that their industry was allowed to wither on the vine. The trade built the dependence that allows the rug to be so completely pulled out from beneath Russia.

Meanwhile Britain, the US, and Canada have been actively training the Ukrainian military for this very war for years. The idea that the west allowed this to happen or discounted the possibility ignores the colossal effort made to prepare the Ukrainian military to defeat Russia.

It’s a classic carrot and stick. The west gave dependence on one hand and built up resistance on the other.

 >No first use (NFU) is a pledge or a policy by a nuclear power not to use nuclear weapons as a means of warfare unless first attacked by an adversary using nuclear weapons. This concept is also applied to chemical and biological warfare in case of the NFU policy of India. NATO has repeatedly rejected calls for adopting NFU policy. During the lifetime of the Soviet Union it argued that pre-emptive nuclear strike is a key option, in order to have a credible deterrent that could compensate for the overwhelming conventional weapon superiority enjoyed by the Soviet Army in Eurasia.

We skipped the attempt to nation build, to infrastructure build, to actually do the thing we set out to do in Afghanistan.

Saddam Hussein was a monster, that is true. But he was a monster who was entirely boxed in, who did not represent an external threat. If we had spent 10 more years in Afghanistan without splitting those forces in half to go to Iraq, Afghanstan would have had a chance to stabilize. Hell, even Vladimir Putin personally helped the United States get materiel in and out of Afghanistan.

I didn't know until I watched/read the fantastic [The Putin Files](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_pPc6-qR9Zzqyps3_JmrNG6h2kMXGfEE) from Frontline - that Iraq was just the 1st of many intended targets.  Apparently the Bush administration had a plan lined up of one country after another - Iraq, then Syria, then Lebanon, and then refocus on Iran afterward.

I don't think if Hitchens knew that this was the goal at the outset, that he would have taken the same line. Maybe he would have.

The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between Laboulaye, a staunch abolitionist, and Frédéric Bartholdi, a sculptor. In after-dinner conversation at his home near Versailles, Laboulaye, an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War, is supposed to have said: ""If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort—a common work of both our nations.""

> In another essay on their website, the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences, ""With the abolition of slavery and the Union's victory in the Civil War in 1865, Laboulaye's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States. In order to honor these achievements, Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France. Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States, the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy.""

Germany has offered to pay for those old tanks to be sent to ukraine but ukraine wants the already modernized tanks that are in duty. So germany would have to give up active duty tanks and wait for the modernization of the old tanks to keep the forces in eastern europe stocked.

This is literally what this discussion is about. 

The point is still that Germany has no more in stock to give.

However, that does not mean that there will be no more deliveries from germany. It just means that those will come directly from Rheinmetall and the others. Germany will happily pay for them. But the storages are empty. Germany has fucked its own military for years. This is the price for this.

I hope so, keep in mind you'll still be bitching about us whatever happens since we don't want to be aligned. It's almost like we cherish our independence, so much for people liking being invaded right ?",False,1649541131.0,t3_tzl30n,t1_i433xwm,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

Btw I have absolutely no issue admiting being arrogant there, as I told you I was trying my best and it wasn't a joke. The issue is you thinking I'm actually being serious when it's all shit talk to piss you off. How exactly do you intend to engage into a proper discussion if you start it by enforcing stereotypes on people like you did first in the thread ? I have to admit, you complaining about people not acting nicely towards yourself while being at fault first is quite weird. If you don't want to engage into shitty banters maybe you should think about not starting them. And if you actually start them actually acknowledge it. I don't know where you're from but that's how it works here in Europe and our anglos at least tend to master that. It's not necessarily productive but it can be fun. 

On a more serious tone, you absolutely wanting to lecture me about my own country is also quite surprising especially when it comes from someone complaining about said ""arrogance"" while basing his own arguments on some really shaky knowledge. 

Ps : whatever you think our national motto means, it's not what it actually means and pointing that out does not make me arrogant.",False,1649545865.0,t3_tzl30n,t1_i43bsh6,,7,1,0,1,0,0,
