As we were meeting this morning Russian missiles struck the town of Vinnytsia and killed at least 20 people, including three children.

It is disgusting, but sadly, it’s become a reality that we contend with each and every day in this Council.

>“A series of torture chambers separated by concrete walls were discovered in a summer camp in Bucha.  At the front, there was a room that appeared to be used for executions, with bullet holes in the walls.  The following room contained two chairs, an empty jug, and a wooden plank.  The Russians had brought in two metal bedsprings and leaned them against the wall in another.  The tableaus suggested to Ukrainian investigators that prisoners were tortured here:  tied to the bedsprings and interrogated; strapped to the plank and waterboarded.  In that chamber, five dead men dressed in civilian clothes were discovered.  They were covered with burns, bruises, and lacerations.  Also, in Zabuchchya, a village in the Bucha district, 18 mutilated bodies of murdered men, women, and children were discovered in a basement: some had their ears cut off, while others had their teeth pulled out” (p. 38-9).

>Colleagues, this report was harrowing to read.  The scale of Russia’s atrocities is vast.  For example, the mission cited “abundant” reports of women and girls being raped and sexually abused by Russia’s armed forces (p. 90).  The report mentions the case of 23-year-old Karina Yershova in Bucha who was abducted, raped, tortured, and finally shot dead by Russian troops.  The report also highlights a report by Commissioner for Human Rights Denisova that 25 girls aged 14 to 24 were kept in a basement in Bucha and gang-raped by Russian troops, resulting in nine becoming pregnant (p. 91).  The report also states that a one-year-old boy was sexually abused and a 78-year-old woman was raped by Russian troops (p. 94).

Day 142 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was probably the quietest day in a long time, we didn’t get shelled, and not a single missile reached the city this time, though 3-4 missiles landed in Chuhuiv. But it’s not like Russians didn’t fire their missiles at Kharkiv this time, and we didn’t intercept them either, actually something much better happened. 

Their missiles just love Russia so much, that they decided to stay there and bombed yet another village in Belgorod oblast. 
Apparently there were 3 missiles, one fell somewhere close to the border and the two remaining missiles fell on their Yasnye Zori village. Not sure if they destroyed any buildings, but Russians were saying that it broke some windows. Russians really didn’t like that; now they are saying that if the missiles can’t reach Kharkiv – they shouldn’t fire them at all.

So they’re completely fine with bombing Kharkiv, but they don’t like being bombed themselves? Well, then they should get used to it, their missiles will only get worse with time, and more of them will start falling in Russia instead of Ukraine. It’s even better when they bomb their own villages, that way some Russians might even come to their senses, but honestly I doubt it. 

Also yesterday’s missile strike damaged 2 more schools and some train tracks, but Russian MOD reported that they “killed 200 nationalists and 50 mercenaries” with that missile strike. Did their MOD hire a fiction writer to make those reports? Do they not understand that saying such unbelievable stuff makes them lose all credibility?

🥷🏿 In Mariupol, partisans destroyed the [sunflower oil factory](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1547629516939337729) to prevent russia from stealing the oil.

👉 The big news of the day is that russia launched 5 Caliber cruise missles from submarines in the black sea.  While Ukraine's air defense managed to [knock down 2](https://twitter.com/IAPonomarenko/status/1547639530303303681), 3 [hit the center of Vinnytsia](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1547534137556455424).

📡 Under the Radar: Today, it was announced that Japan wants to [reactivate 9 nuclear reactors](https://twitter.com/ArjenDeHeus020/status/1547676744722685955) by winter.  These reactors, shuttered since the Fukushima tragedy, will allow Japan to reduce its use of imported gas and free up LNG ships which can be used to help Europe through, perhaps, the worst energy crisis it has ever faced this coming winter.

>In announcing the session, the State Duma said “issues that need urgent solutions have accumulated” and “government initiatives” need to be considered.

There's a few things in here I found interesting. One is this new Deputy Prime Minister position that Putin just created.

>Manturov, 53, was officially nominated for the position of deputy prime minister, minister of industry and trade, on July 13 after Putin signed a decree increasing the number of deputy prime ministers to 11.

>The news agency also quoted Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin as saying the introduction of the new position was necessitated by the need to make quick decisions in the face of unprecedented Western sanctions leveled against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.

Also:

>There also have been reports in Russian media quoting unidentified sources indicating that a broader government shakeup could be in the works.

There's been reports of alleged changes like Rogozin being removed as head of Roscosmos and Borisov being moved to that position, as well as, possibly, some other changes, but I've not seen those claims substantiated yet.

Paroev said that factories in both “friendly” and “unfriendly” countries belong to five or six major companies headquartered in unfriendly nations, which have therefore refused to supply to Russia.

e61e3fa1c93925ba758ad08281b58b4b,vzf52e,ig88k8g,"They warned me, 40 years ago, that peak-oil would lead to an era of global conflict. They were right, but the reason they gave me was wrong. 



The term ‘peak-oil’ has been used and abused to mean 18 different things, but the first time that it started getting talked about was in the context of peak oil-productivity. They should have called it valley-oil, the point when the cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground and to the market was the lowest.



The theory was that the standard-of-living increases that the planet experienced in the 20th century were a direct product of our ability as a species to tap the free energy that was stored in buried hydrocarbons. And it made sense. You could graph average prosperity against average energy use and the two lines matched up almost perfectly. The more we burned, the more we made.



And it also made sense because almost all of the ways of making money that there were used a lot of energy. Transportation. Manufacturing. Farming. If you wanted to make more money? You had to burn more oil.



But then something weird happened. The lines started to diverge. Industries that used hardly any energy started becoming a bigger and bigger part of the overall economy. We already had movies and music. But then came computers. Bill Gates became the richest person in the world by selling floppy-disks that hardly required any energy to produce, and he charged hundreds of dollars for them. Today, the entire internet-based economy, games, social media, everything digital, is a huge chunk of the economy, and all you have to do to generate economic activity energy-wise is to keep the lights on and the air-conditioner running for some people at some computers. 



40 years ago, they didn’t see that coming. The assumption was that there was going to come a point where supertankers couldn’t get any bigger, when drilling couldn’t get any more efficient, and when most of the easy oil had already been burned. They worried that a reversal of the trend of ever-cheaper oil would mark the end of ever-better living.



They were wrong. Between energy costs loosening their grip on economic growth, to the truly massive strides in the advancement of alternative energy production technology, the global depression sparked wars due to peak-oil that they predicted didn’t happen.



The energy war that has happened, the one that Vladimir Putin started, has because those other wars didn’t. Vladimir Putin is playing the old game, the wrong game. He’s playing it like the non-energy-intensive economy never blossomed, like PV-cell technology was still in its infancy. He read those same warnings that I read 40 years ago, but he didn’t see them as warning signs, he saw them as a roadmap. Vladimir Putin is trying to wage energy-wars the way it was predicted while it’s still even remotely a game that can sort of be played. 



We don’t need to burn ever more hydrocarbons to live better lives. We know that now. A viable path to a brighter future has become apparent. We still have to take it, of course. But Vladimir Putin definitely doesn’t want it. He’s bummed that those fears turned out to be wrong. I’m thrilled. Once we are rid of Putin I think we will have a much easier time of making a better future.",False,1657862686.0,t3_vzf52e,t3_vzf52e,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 15 July 2022
 
- In the Donbas, Russian and pro-Russian Luhansk People's Republic separatist forces claim to have entered the outskirts of Siversk. This has not been corroborated, however, Russian forces have been slowly advancing westwards following shelling and probing assaults towards Siversk from Lysychansk to open a pathway onward to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. Bakhmut is likely to be the next objective, once Siversk is secured.


- Since withdrawing from the strategically located Snake Island on 30 June 2022, Russia has been attempting to deny its use by Ukraine. However, on 13 July 2022 airstrikes by two Su-27 Russian fighter jets failed to hit the island. This follows the pattern of Russian air forces failing to successfully engage in the tactical battle.


- Over 2.5m people have now been evacuated from Ukraine to Russia since the start of the invasion. Russia continues to face accusations that it is forcibly deporting Ukrainians; in many cases Ukrainians have reportedly been mistreated in filtration camps set up by Russia.

The Russians, may it be out of habit, budgetary restrictions, lack of consistent and experienced manpower, or whatnot, never assessed their readiness on a realistic level.   When they conduct exercises and practice, they're pretty much having each and every group perform their own thing on their individual checklists from up top.   There's never any cross-check against realistic circumstances or random events - basically, you run in, do what you've been told is your role, and you're considered ready.

Western army approaches run differently.   When western armies perform exercise, it's usually full on 'red on blue' engagements, where all of the forces designated to be on a side have to coordinate the overall effort, as well as verify that each element can perform the operational tasks assigned to them as part of a more detailed doctrine on a platoon and brigade level.  You exercise like you're trying to win a battle, and there are thorough breakdowns on what you did right, and what you got absof\*\*\*inglutely wrong.

The Russians probably performed an assessment of their armed forces on their readiness for a conflict.  The groups probably said 'we're completely ready for a battle', based on the limited scope of their self-evaluation.   Then they went straight into planning an overall game plan, but didn't build any contingencies or stopgaps their troops could take if they encountered issues.

The previous coalition ceased to function one month ago (PM fired all the ministers from the other party).

The opposition was afraid to call for a vote of no confidence to remove the PM because the president may declare an emergency election. Poll numbers show that Kallas' party would probably gain seats by such an election.

As such, there was this weird limbo phase where half the ministers were fired but no new government.

After a long period of talks, Kallas' Reform party formed a new coalition with the Social Democrats and Isamaa (directly translates to *Fatherland*). So now the PM finally resigns to form the new government.

We know that some of the most experienced and well supplied russian forces were the ones stationed in Crimea, and was responsible for the significant occupation of a large part of South Ukraine.

What was sent to Donbass, was either the incapable Buryati forces which was among other things, responsible for the Bucha massacre alongside Chechens and ''newly'' formed army groups. Or part of the decimated forces which struck Sumy and Kharkiv. They had numbers combined with the ''volunteers'', but lacked in many areas.

What Ukraine has been facing in the south are likely a significant source of Ukrainian difficulties. I came to consider this after seeing the massive signs of fires from artillery on the southern front, mainly on the Ukrainian side, that the satellite firewarning system showed us.

I'm old enough to have lived through a ton of conflicts and the cold war too. I live in what is deemed one of the most peaceful nations on earth. We border Russia, we have had relations to Russia throughout these periods. 

Half a year ago, people were *shocked* that electricity prices were record high. We've had various public debates about immigration waves through the years, from Chile, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria to name a few. People here live well and they worry about anything that can jeopardize our quality of life, but they have always also landed on reaching out to help. We're one of the world largest foreign aid contributors, and we did take in lots of refugees, but it was always controlled and discussed publicly. We are *adamant* about not exporting weaponry to conflict zones, despite producing amounts of advanced weaponry. People here have had good relations to Russia, we have a lot of Russian work emigrants in industry and tech.  

&nbsp;

Enter the Ukraine war. People were literally hounding the government to speed up getting refugees here. Calls for weapon deliveries were instantaneous. No one, and I have an unusually wide contact surface both online and off, and I mean it when I say **no one** has any comment to the drastic rise of fuel prices, even further increases in electricity price (we export more now because Central Europe are stocking up on gas), the rent going up, living costs increasing across the board, other than ""Fuck Russia, and fuck them sideways with a broomstick, push aid and push it harder"". Everyone wants us to support Ukraine even more. No one supports Russia. And we have taken in lots of refugees, we've sent Ukraine funds, Antitank missiles, Anti-aircraft missiles, Ammunition, Self-propelled 155mm artillery wagons and next up is an advanced modern anti-aircraft system in collaboration with the US. I'm telling you...in my close to 50 years, I have **never** seen such a shift in public opinion. This country as a whole fully supports Ukraine, and will continue to do so indefinetly. We will undoubtedly help rebuild when they win, and I suspect we will be doing so to the tune of pretty vast sums. There's suprisingly many saying ""let Ukraine join NATO *now* and fuck the consequences"".

It's not so much about taking out missiles as it is about getting aerial superiority, denying russian planes and drones the ability to operate over ukrainian territory and (eventually) making it impossible for Russian troops and tanks to move in large numbers due to the ever present risk of airstrike. Those sorts of numbers of modern planes in the air would also allow the ukrainian airforce to be extremely aggressive about going after AA sites because they could accept a few losses knowing they weren't operating on the shoestring they are at the moment where every UAF plane shot down is a huge loss.

At the moment Ukraine has more troops on the ground than russia but needs to be extremely cautious with troop movements and concentrations because the risk of airstrikes or just drone spotting + artillery. Which means they can't go on the offensive on a large-scale and exploit their numerical advantage.

If Ukraine had control of its airspace everything changes, suddenly the extra ukrainian volunteers on the ground come into play and russia is heavily outmatched and facing a larger army that can move freely on the offensive.

Mobilisation is on the critical path to fixing that.

Their doctrine for fighting a war against Nato assumed full mobilisation and so the motorised rifle brigades were built on the assumption that their contract soldiers would make up 70% of the nominal strength (notably including officers, specialists, technicians, etc - a much higher proportion of tail than tooth, and of the tooth it's disproportionately armour & artillery instead of infantry) while conscripts would be the other 30%, to be mobilised when needed and otherwise participating in the peacetime economy (and hence paying taxes and not needing to be paid wages). Without those conscripts, we're seeing ridiculous things like mid-level officers leading small formations and BMPs being driven without any infantry inside.

If Putin declared full mobilisation today, just on the basis that mobilisation is necessary to fixing one of their big effectiveness problems, it'd be concerning to see. Ukraine's definitely got a big head start on mobilising and training - you can't just grab a guy off the street, hand him a rifle, and the next day he's effortlessly coordinating with armour (as experimentally proven by the DNR) - and HIMARS really has changed the game for Russian supply lines. But Russia fixing one of its major problems can't help but be bad for Ukraine, even if there are still other major problems (and there are), even if the fix won't actually start being evidenced for months.

But that's contingent on Russia mobilising. The missing infantry problem was clear *months* ago. It's also clear that Putin doesn't want to mobilise, maybe for fear of domestic reaction, maybe because of the worry that the economy couldn't stand it. I don't know what would be different now to, say, mid-May that'd make mobilisation suddenly palatable.

That got deleted while I was writing a response, the goal of which was for him to make an effort to make sure his uncle was alright medically, from a physical standpoint, that is.  I spent some time on that responses, too - those were symptoms (really, not making it up) that my next door neighbor was experiencing (not joking) while literal cancer was secretly eating him alive.

... You know what, I spent some time on that and copied it to my phone's clipboard once I tried to submit it but couldn't...

For posterity:

---------

Dude - I'm not making this up - my next door neighbor started doing the same thing.  He even dropped of some wack job article at a point in our mail box about how our sons were in danger (the thing kinda went from 2017-19).  He had started watching Fox non-stop and swallowed Tucker.  His immediate family refused to be alienated as his health slipped further and further but he refused to see a doctor - and iirc, he pulled some BS from Fox as the reason doctors and hospitals are BS themselves and blamed it on a bad reaction to a blood pressure med - never bothered looking for another opinion, just said forget it, doctors don't know anything.

Now, understand, this guy has always been 100% - I mean, he looked out for everyone on the block, was always doing some act of kindness, and loved to hate squirrels.

Long story short, one evening the family called a former neighbor who is a doctor and knew them because things were really bad that night.  She came over, looked at him and said call an ambulance.  He protested and went up to this bedroom where his young adult son saw him trying to work the gun lock on his pistol box - and heard him mutter something along the lines of 'I'm not going to the hospital.'

So he comes down stairs and mentions it while the doc is on the phone with 911 and the operator hears it.

... So we spent the next three and a half hours in our basement because of a 'barricaded gunman' situation (found out later that the ex-neighbor/doctor was *absolutely out-of-her-mind* angry with the police), with swat team members hiding around our house as we watched movies in the basement with the kids telling them it was a 'freak, localized weather event in the middle of JANUARY' because this guy had never been anything but kind to them (and every other kid on the block regardless as to ethnicity).  Hell, they even had a sniper down the block - probably the best position for the guy in his big frosty the snowman camouflage suit... Looked like he hadn't jogged around a block since 1976.

Anyway, I digress.  They finally made entry just to find him sleeping on the couch, no firearms around him... And they took him to the hospital via ambulance.

That's where they found out that it *wasn't* a reaction to a blood pressure med, years earlier, no, it was cancer starting its thing - and by this point, the cancer had spread throughout his entire body and was eating him alive - there was nothing that could be done about it.

He spent the next six months on hospice and, with the pain under control, he had a few good days where he was able to sit on his front porch and watch the kids fall off their bike and, maybe, if it was a real good day for him, he was strong enough to throw a nerf football at a squirrel.  He passed on an absolutely beautiful summer day - the weather was perfect.

*Sorry about that - I included the tl;dr because of that rant.*

Also to note Russia might be able to keep producing artillery, but they do not have a high capacity production to do that. As Russia does not currently have factories that even make towed artillery. They switched their arty factories to producing MSTA-S SPGs which ARE more expensive than a M777 (\~1.6 Million).  They have produced \~1000 of them since 1988, but that averages out to about 30 SPGs per year.   So they will run out of the good long range artillery if those keep getting hit, and replacing it with shitty WW2 era stock arty that only has 1/4 to 1/3 the range which they have a lot of in storage. That is a huge diminishment in capability.

We've still got transport bottlenecks that are most of the reason the Ukrainians haven't gotten lots of other gear faster.  Adding in the support needs of modern fighters will be another supply burden on an already overloaded system.  


Now, I'd expect we'd keep their operational numbers stable, so if they lose a plane it would get replaced pretty quick, but how large that number is will depend on how big a slice of the logistics stream we want the fighters to consume.  


Still, even a small force of operational fighters would make a big difference here.  I'd be leery of using them to take on AA defenses directly though, wouldn't it be better to use HIMARs to take out the AA?  Which probably takes us back down the road of supplying Ukraine with those 300km missiles so they can push out their air cover curtain.  

I'd expect any actual grant of fighters to Ukraine would come with a requirement that they not be used to attack Russia.

Similar experience.  My buddy's got a good collection of firearms and we'll go shooting once in a blue moon.  The comparison between his AR and the AK is night and day and the most contrasting difference that I noticed was just *that*.  ... The AK rattled - I mean I could *feel* the internal parts begin to make contact with each other *inside* of it as I pulled the trigger back.  It was a *completely* different experience than his AR's or the M-16's I've used in the past!

With the latter two, it was a unit. I never felt components make contact with each other as I pulled the trigger - it was just a smooth glide with a little bit of a hump (I haven't touched a 16 in more than twenty years, so I might be a bit foggy on it - but the AR's he has are butter).

That said, I even think the SKS he has has smoother trigger action.

Another point worth noticing is that a notable number of the parts to an AK are *stamped* and then formed by being bent by machinery - again - that's a stark contrast to its American counterparts where they seem to be mostly (if not entirely) machined.

Of course, the argument for the AK is that it can be produced relatively inexpensively and with fewer/less advanced manufacturing practices.  And, of course, the counter to that argument is that *that* doesn't matter if you're in range of the other guy before he's in range of you, I suppose, but I digress...

Military targets would also be much more protected so fixed civilian targets would be easier to select and hit.

Why is it about this and not invasion lines? Simple, because of the Nuclear deterrent and because it has been clear for decades that Europe would rather peacefully trade with Russia than engage in war.

 - European powers SHOULD HAVE, but DID NOT (due to their own internal political problems - (sound familiar?)) strictly enough enforce sanctions and restrictions on post-WWI Germany's military build-up.

*A $40 billion spending package passed by Congress last month aims to replenish these stockpiles. But the problem goes deeper than short-term supply disruptions. Military planners and defense contractors have long prioritized spending on big-ticket “platforms,” such as aircraft carriers and fighter jets, over making weapons themselves. Pandemic-related disruptions in the supply chain for microchips have made the problem worse. And the erosion of the military’s industrial base has made it harder for the Pentagon to accelerate production. Defense-industry concentration, cumbersome contracting rules, and a shortage of skilled workers have slashed the number of companies in the business. A 2020 Pentagon report found that in an alarming number of cases, the military relies on a single, “often fragile” supplier to make critical components.*

*The weakness of the Pentagon’s supply chain threatens not only aid to Ukraine but also America’s ability to respond to future crises — including a potential conflict over Taiwan, whose military depends on US-made hardware. To address the current strain, President Joe Biden should consider invoking the Defense Production Act, which requires manufacturers to prioritize delivering goods for defense-related needs over orders from other industries. Although sometimes misused for political purposes, the authority could in this case help to ease production bottlenecks for military vehicles and heavy weaponry.*",False,1657923136.0,t3_vzf52e,t1_igbg8rm,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

1. They didn't care about heavy losses, taking KIA numbers of more than double *all* of Germany's deaths across all fronts, and still winning.

2. They had the US supplying them with hardware and had spooled up their own domestic industry too.

The result is a basically unstoppable Soviet swarm - their lack of training and high death rates absorbed by just being near infinitely replaceable. Germany was fighting a Soviet Zerg Rush.

There are two scenarios that would have resulted in a US/UK victory over the USSR without completely untenable loss of life on the US/UK side:

1. Use of US nuclear weapons against USSR in 1946/47, either strategic strikes on population centres or more likely as battlefield tactical weapons eliminating huge swathes of the Red Army to a level beyond their sustainable limits.

2. The canning of lend-lease as far back as 1942/3, allowing the Eastern Front to grow and grow, Germany having to pull forces from the West, Soviets falling back to the Urals, before either Nazi Germany or the unsupported USSR would fail and capitulate to the other, and then US forces pushing in to sweep up the mess of two spent factions.

It's the logically absurd result of the contrived attempt to equate filtration camps to concentration camps. In order to call a filtration camp a concentration camp, you are trying to make out a filtration camp to be the filtration facility within a concentration camp system and then call that facility by the name of the entire thing it is grouped under, namely a concentration camp system (except we arbitrarily also remove that last 'system' part). I'm trying to show by reductio ad absurdum how it logically doesn't work:

Those who 'pass' Russian filtration camps either get to stay in occupied Ukraine or get sent to some backwater place in Russia. Those who 'pass' 'filtration facilities' in concentration camp systems get sent to other concentration camps - or stay in the concentration camp the facility is part of - to be worked to death.

So, if Russian filtration camps are part of a concentration camp system, the places they send their 'passing' inmates would have to be concentration camps as well (see the previous paragraph). That means that since passing women, children, collaborators etc may get to stay in occupied Ukraine, in order for the 'filtration camp' = 'concentration camp (system)' equivalence to work, the places they are sent would be concentration camps as well which means their original residences in occupied Ukraine are concentration camps. It's absurd, so the equivalence doesn't work.

Since 'filtration camp' is already an established term from the past - see .e.g. NKVD filtration camps - that is conceptually very close to the present-day filtration camps: places of interrogations, torture, killings, and not generally the end destination that undesirables are sent to like concentration camps are, they are better suited under that term.

Edit (added after the reply below since the topic is locked): when I say 'pass' I refer to people who get a favorable outcome and leave the filter. Not the people who get filtered out. This is standard terminology (think band-pass, high-pass, etc).",1657954975.0,1657921884.0,t3_vzf52e,t1_igb3t21,,8,1,0,1,0,0,
