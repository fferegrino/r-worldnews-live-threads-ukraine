- Hitler embarked on the first of his territorial ambitions by ensuring the union of Germany and Austria. Putin has pretty much done the same thing with Belarus in all but name by making Lukashenko his lapdog.
- Hitler then demanded that the Sudentenland, a part of Czechoslovakia (an independent country) become part of Germany and annexed it. Guess what Putin did with Crimea!
- Hitler wasn't satisfied with just the Sudentenland tho, he wanted ALL of Czechoslovakia, so he invaded and split the country into 2, one becoming a ""protectorate"" (i.e. puppet governement) of Germany, the other becoming the First Slovak Republic. It looks like Putin is trying this right now, invading so that he can install a puppet government in Eastern Ukraine and possibly leaving a weaker, ""neutral"" government in Western Ukraine
- What next? Well Hitler then raised issue with the Polish corridor, which cut off East Prussia from the rest of Germany, and used it as a pretext to invade Poland. Guess what, Kaliningrad Oblast is cut off from the rest of Russia by the Baltic States (in particular Lithuania)...

China will be there to alleviate most the sanctions. 

Can NATO do more? No, not really. NATO is primarily a defensive alliance not for provoking war. Sending NATO troops into Ukraine will almost be unlikely as it undermines the whole alliance (One way is if - Article 4 invoked by some countries, invokes article 5).

Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian eurasianist, fascist, and nationalist who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.


> In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the United States and Atlanticism to lose their influence in Eurasia, and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.

> The book declares that ""the battle for the world rule of Russians"" has not ended and Russia remains ""the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution"". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed ""on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.""

> The book states that ""the maximum task [of the future] is the 'Finlandization' of all of Europe""

> In Europe:

> * Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe.
*  Kaliningrad Oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term ""Moscow–Berlin axis"".
* France should be encouraged to form a bloc with Germany, as they both have a ""firm anti-Atlanticist tradition""
* The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe
*  Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".
* Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence
* Latvia and Lithuania should be given a ""special status"" in the Eurasian–Russian sphere
* Poland should be granted a ""special status"" in the Eurasian sphere
* Romania, North Macedonia, Serbia, ""Serbian Bosnia"" and Greece – ""Orthodox collectivist East"" – will unite with ""Moscow the Third Rome"" and reject the ""rational-individualistic West""
> * **Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"".

Well both assumptions were proved wrong and there are hundreds if not thousands of Ukrainians dead for no reason. Fighting a war you were never going to win is not a viable strategy to pursue. 1 vs 1, Ukraine army is just no match for Russia. 

Hundreds of lives butchered due to Putin's madness and blood thirst but also because Ukraine miscalculated in a big way

Downvoting doesnt change facts or whats going on. Having nukes is also not an option for tiny states.

As an Austrian I am neutral to both sides, so for me the Russian aggression seems more like a reaction on the expansion of NATO alongside with placing nuclear military equipment around them (Baltic states, Poland) and defense mechanisms against them (Turkey).

Although I would have preferred Russia to just accept the US dominance over Europe (even more an independet, self defending Europe), for me the aggression is legit from a politic point of view. This is why Russia is trying to harm as few Ukrainians as possible. I really hope for a quick surrender without much bloodshed. The East becomes independent, Russia has shown its strengh an gets a buffer to NATO, the rest of the Ukraine stays independent with a new government.

It seems to me that the Ukrainian government was naïve to trust in US support for their remote controlled playing with fire (interrupting gas transition and even the water supply for Krim). They pokered high and lost, while the US can even profit off cutting NordStream2.

At the same time also Russia was playing the same role for China, who consecutively increased granted support and bought Russian exports over the last years, to eventually become the new major power and annex Taiwan.

Doing that takes a significant amount of time and planning no matter what.

As bitter as it might be until Russia crossed the point of no return NATO couldn't just build up it's own forces significantly without an actual provocation. Even if Ukraine falls to Russia, the best strategy is containment. Ramp up defensive forces across the eastern countries to deter any further aggression, blackball the Russian economy, support the Ukrainians in their fight against invaders with supplies.

When your dealing with an idiot with a gun (in this case nukes) the most effective strategy is to bide your time and wait em out. Putin seems to have lost the plot and got notions of grandeur to relive the good old days of the soviet union, the only way to stop that without a direct conflict or things going nuclear is to make the costs so prohibitive that he's forced to either relent or he's driven out by his own people sick of his shite.

- Separate Britain from the rest of Europe
- Take back the Ukraine
- Incite social unrest within the US and encourage isolationist policies in American politics

The endgame of the book is essentially resurrection of Russia as a world power and the erosion of American/Western European dominance.

>Do you reckon Russia just takes Ukraine and walks away?

With more sanctions, but yes. It's hard to sell a direct war with Russia over a country that isn't either a NATO or EU member. Specially when Russia already threatened ""Consequences they have never seen"" is someone steps into this conflict. No one wants to risk nuclear war, specially over Ukraine.

>What comes next?

Hard to say. Putin could do this to Ukraine because it wasn't EU/NATO. The Baltics are both, Poland is both, Finland also is a no-go. My next guess is consolidating in central Asia, in the former Soviet Republics (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, etc). Georgia is also tricky, because while it isn't in NATO, it does have bilateral defense pacts with NATO countries. So Russia can't really expand West without being suicidal, can't expand East because that's China and, well, the Pacific ocean. They can only go south, so I can see them using Azerbaijan to fight proxy wars in Armenia and Georgia. They won't go into the middle east, they already lost a long and expensive war in Afghanistan and won't mess with Iran.

e48a394b305ca2363cd7c45494fd08ff,t08urg,hy8ak5z,"The problem is that Putin ""feels uneasy"" with having NATO nations on his borders.

Quite why he has this unease is pretty obvious. It means he can't expand his borders in order to distract from problems at home by annexing territories that don't belong to him without facing serious reprisals from NATO.

So the question really is what can he annexe next.

In the south Georgia, Azerbaijan are NATO partners - like Ukraine - while Turkey is a member.

In the north Finland is a NATO partner while Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are members.

So if I had to hazard a guess I would say he'd go after Georgia or Azerbaijan next while making threatening gestures towards Finland.

The problem is that someone who has nothing to lose is dangerous af for everyone else and is better being put down. But it's not like that scenario doesn't have major complications. Unfortunately life isn't a movie and we can't send in Steve Seagal to fatly assassinate him while dressed as Gordon Ramsey. Plus in many ways Putin isn't the problem - it's the people who control him and the money they use to do it.

It's why going after that money and crippling those people's incomes is so important.",False,1645703388.0,t3_t08urg,t1_hy89l4f,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Using america as a reference, mainstream media(left leaning) have been making fun of anyone who says Russia is a threat/bad for 15 years now. Seeing Russia as a major geopolitical threat has become a fokey, “old man” opinion. 

Russia has been systematically favored over countries like China in terms of trust and deals. China is a more flashy threat but Russia has been a bigger worldwide military threat and anyone with sense knew. But everyone acted like it was OK to prop up Russian government.

With all of that said Ukraine is far from an innocent puppy. Ukraine is not a true democracy. It’s an oligarchy. They put political rivals in jail and did not join NATO because they didn’t want to comply with human rights requirements. I’m not defending the invasion AT ALL, but I am pointing out why the west is condemning Russia going to war at all instead of specifically jumping to Ukrainian aid. I hope I threaded that needle and didn’t come off as justifying.

This part shouldn't be controversial and you will see lawmakers on both sides all over the world arguing this in months/years to come.

This is more controversial but also if the west had no intentions of letting Ukraine join NATO, where we would have to defend them if the Russians attacked, they should have told them that instead of bringing the people of Ukraine down this path.  
 

Putin shouldn't be attacking Ukraine today, but people acting like its exclusively Putin or the Russian oligarchs who put us here are wrong. If Putin wasn't in power, Russia would be doing the same thing because a Russian aligned/neutral Ukraine doesn't stop being an area of strategic importance for Russia just because Putin isn't in control.

Replacing a gas powerplant with a nuclear plant might seem feasible, but certainly not replacing 6.8 million individual and privately owned gas heaters. Plus, you make yourself again dependent on the countries which produce Uran, and guess who is on that list in the top 10. Additionally, Germany exports more electricity than it needs, with renewable energy sources being a big producer. Storage capabilities in the form of pump hydro stations exist as well. The one infrastructure which needs updating though are the transmission lines.

The usage of Gas for electricity has not increased since the closure of nuclear energy plants in Germany, and electric energy produced by oil and coal decreased as well.

Not exactly the same, there reasons to avoid conflict are different now.

Back then there was no NATO so countries where ""free"" to decide to join or not, so that decision was harder, what if they joined the fight and no else backed them up? There was no guarantee that help would come if things went south, so they were more reluctant. Remember France during WW 2? 

Now with NATO we have Article 5, when triggered they're all ""obligated"" to join, so countries are safer if they're attacked because they know help will come. But at the same time, sending help basically means NATO sending help, so it has to be ""worth it"" because most of the world will be dragged along and, sadly, from a economical and geographical standing point, Ukraine is not worth this price.

So NATO now has to wait... if Putin mess with a NATO country they have no choice but help, that's Article 5. Also, Putin making a new move after Ukraine, even against a non-NATO country would basically mean he will go after a NATO country after that, so they would probably act preemptively to stop him. For now the only thing at stake is Ukraine, which again sadly is not worth enough for the EU and US start a war over it.",False,1645706427.0,t3_t08urg,t1_hy8cbkb,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Russian troops sent to Belarus for military exercises will remain in the country indefinitely, Belarus’s defence ministry has said, in a decision that will further fuel concerns Moscow is planning an imminent Ukraine invasion.  
  
They include 30,000 combat troops, elite Spetsnaz units, Su-35 fighter jets and S-400 missile defence systems.

If that were the case, then big bad Russia and Putin wouldnt feel so ""threatened"" by Ukraine and feel the need to invade.

That is not ""balanced"", that is echoing the propaganda from the Kremlin. NATO is not a threat to Russia and has never made a move to attack Russia, if this were remotely true...then why did nothing happen in 1991?
