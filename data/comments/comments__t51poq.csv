c51014ebc84ac587e0f52d5010f13179,t51poq,hz1z2ye,"Thousands of Ukrainians have volunteered to defend their country and to fight Russia’s invasion, with recruits including IT workers and builders taking part in basic training before setting off for battle.

The volunteer centre in Lviv was packed on Wednesday with new soldiers who had signed up to join territorial defence units. Some were in military uniform. Others wore civilian clothes and baseball hats and carried shiny backpacks.

They lined up for the first time in a street on Taras Shevchenko Avenue, named after Ukraine’s national poet. “Raise your hand if you have a car,” their new commander barked. The recruits divided into groups and introduced themselves. Around them snow fell.

“History is happening right now. I don’t want to be on the sidelines,” Vitali, the 35-year-old boss of a Lviv startup said, speaking an assembly point. “I want to make history. Finally the world should know what is evil and what is good. We have the whole world’s support.”

He added: “The main reason we are going to win is because of people.” What was his message for Vladimir Putin? “I don’t negotiate with terrorists,” he said. “He is going to die soon. His regime will fall into dust.”

Vitali said he and his company’s 15 employees had begun weapons training five days before Russia’s attack. He had volunteered the day of the invasion. The recruits were going to learn combat first aid and other skills at an undisclosed location outside the city, he said.

With Kharkiv and Kyiv under brutal bombardment and the Ukrainian army encircled in the city of Mariupol, volunteers from western Ukraine are being brought in as reinforcements.

It's entirely based on this preconceived notion that Russia's army is this powerful juggernaut. It's cold war thinking about Russia's capability. There's no reason to believe that Russia hasn't sent in their ""true strength"" yet.

For all intents and purposes it seems like Russia drastically underestimated Ukrainian resolve and the west response. You don't send thousands to needlessly die unless you are convinced of a few things. 

1. That your army is better than they are
2. That your enemy is weaker than they are


It seems likely the actual reason this is being fucked up so bad is Russian forces are poorly trained and maintained, army leaders are afraid to tell Putin the truth about any of it, soldiers were not told the real reason for being there, the belief that this would be a cake walk, and the idea that the Ukrainian people would welcome them with open arms.

Keep in mind that this fuck up and poor Russian operation is only miles from their border. They have a direct connection to their country and it's supplies and it's still going this badly. There is absolutely no excuse for it beyond incompetence and poor morale.

I think military analysts are having a hard time figuring out what's going on is because we have our notions of what the Russian military is like and suddenly that seems to be all on its head. So because of that they are rushing to quantify it with our idea of the Russian military and that's where we get this idea that the real forces somehow haven't been used.

Asking something else to this. Despite the fact that Russia's army is 5+ times larger than Germany's, their spending is less than Germany's per year. This should be a red flag as to Russia's military claims.",False,1646232710.0,t3_t51poq,t3_t51poq,,0,227,0,227,0,0,

At a prime minister’s questions that began with the rare sight of MPs standing in unison to applaud the Ukrainian ambassador, Vadym Prystaiko, who was watching from the public gallery, Starmer repeatedly called for tougher action against Russian oligarchs.

2e5c690ea662c97d13b1d9b4648beab6,t51poq,hz20axx,"WHY RUSSIA COULD DEFAULT ON SOVEREIGN DEBT:
Eurobonds are in Euros. Russia sold a bond (a promise to repay) to a European country in exchange for let’s say 100m Euros. Let’s say the interest rate on the bond is 5% (idk what it really is). Russia has to pay 5m euros every year to the country that gave them initial 100m euros. Usually these are made in semi-annual or quarterly payments (so 25% of 5m ever 3 months for quarterly).

The reason this is a big deal for Russia is because 5m Euros is worth 50% more in rubles than it was like a week ago, and that’s with markets closed. 

So Russia’s debt payment bill in rubles (the currency they collect in taxes) is now suddenly MUCH larger than anticipated because they must pay Euros. This coincides with basically a freeze of economic activity in Russia which in turn means a freeze in tax collections. Which means the government is probably low on cash flow. 

This means they might not have the funds on hand to pay their debt. This USUALLY isn’t a big deal, you just take out more debt, when you’re an established country like Russia, you usually have a pretty damn good credit rating.

HOWEVER Russian foreign debt markets are frozen by both the west AND PUTIN HIMSELF. If Russia defaults on its debt, EVERYTHING they do becomes massively more expensive. They’ll be unable to borrow for a LONG time without paying junk bond interest rates (even from friendly places like China) and basically will NOT be able to fund their economy through short-term struggles (like sanctions)

if this had happened to the US during say ‘08 (a financial disaster), we would’ve seen a collapse of our entire financial system as confidence in borrowing is built upon the belief that the government will eventually be able to pay.

Defaulting on debt is seen as a big snowball event, if they do indeed default in 2 weeks, it will have worldwide financial impacts that are felt for generations. Credit ratings do not forget about defaults, ever.",1646233310.0,1646233135.0,t3_t51poq,t3_t51poq,,0,49,0,49,0,0,

There are a lot of people who go, ""it's hard to know what Putin is thinking now, and why he's doing this."" I don't think so. It seems pretty clear. I'll try to do a quick run-down:

**Putin's time as a KGB Officer During the Cold War**

Putin was a 37-year-old KGB Officer stationed in East Germany when the Berlin Wall fell. Embarassed by the might of the USSR seemingly falling overnight, he maintained that bitter resentment over the years and stoked the embers of disdain for the West from the likes of Clinton's airstrikes in Serbia, to the wanton neoconservative aggression stemming from Cheney & Rumsfeld's war in Iraq under the Bush Administration. He began shaping his plans, using past instances of wrongdoing as precedent to permit further atrocities at the behest of his own legacy and Russia.

**COVID Lockdown Madness**

It's been speculated by intelligence officials and ambassadors that Putin's mental health has declined considerably during covid lockdown protocols within Russia. There, isolating himself from a wider range of voices, he was surrounded by the most ardent Yes-Men and extremist voices within his bunker. In Stalinistic fashion, anyone who dissented would've liked been seen as traitors and summarily fired or worse. It's thought that during this time his most radical ideas floated were lapped up by his ardent loyalists and amplified back to Putin, pushing Putin to act on what he otherwise might have more cautiously resisted. 

**Putin's 5,000-word Essay of July 2021**

This potentially led to Putin foreshadowing the Ukrainian invasion in his 5,000-word published Essay on thew Kremlin's website. In it, he talks at length about restoring Russia to its former glory as the Russian Empire. Within that, he explicitly notes that the entirety of Ukraine is of Russian territory and that, ""Russia was robbed."" 

This is thus much larger than any immediate economic gains; Putin wants blitzkrieg gains in territory for Russia, and he wants to cement his legacy as a leader who helped to restore Russia to its glory-days by way of military conquest. With covid-lockdown madness, he seemingly abandoned his attempts at soft-power, for it was taking too long.


**How does Putin Justify This?**


Cutting through the propaganda of the official line, how does Putin justify the actions he knows he's taking to *himself*? 

As with most autocrats, ethics and morality are largely tossed out of the window with an, ""Ends Justify the Means"" mentality, substituted by a deflective Tu Quoque fallacy of, ""You Did it, Too!"". Simply by saying, ""This is for the greater good and you'll all be happier once we're through this,"" Putin likely rationalizes that this is the needle of a vaccine before inoculation. In his own words, Putin believes that ""If a fight is inevitable, you should be the one to throw the first punch."" This of course speaks to his Cold War grudges and alludes to what he may have done during the Cuban Missile Crisis, contingent on the false-premise that the fight was ever inevitable in the first place. 

In his past, Putin has had no qualms with supporting dictators like Assad who used chemical-weapons blatantly on his own people. He's had no problem killing off or throwing opposition in prison via Kangaroo Courts. Even the Apartment Bombings of 1999 are considered by many a false-flag to bring him to power, journalists ruthlessly murdered who started connecting the dots with ease. 

This has nothing to do with Nazis in Ukraine (reminder, Zelenskyy himself is Jewish, and Russians just hit the Holocaust memorial as they killed civilians int he process); that is propaganda to rally his own troops and domestic support. It has nothing to do with Ukraine, a sovereign independent nation, joining a defensive alliance like NATO—that was only to ensure Ukraine remained vulnerable to seizing. Ukraine or NATO was never a ""security threat"" to the borders of Russia. In fact, neo-nazis have been on the rise in Russia perhaps more-so than many other nations. The reality is this conflict has everything to do with Putin ""rightfully taking back"" what he believes is his. *Whataboutism* AKA ""Two-Wrongs-Somehow-Make-a-Right""/Race-to-the-bottom propaganda, is just a convenient excuse. Even now, there are suspicious users online like /u/haekz incessantly spamming these rhetorical deflections to divert attention away from the Present, timely, and large-scale atrocity that isn't a matter of history but ongoing and can be stopped in its tracks *now*. Be wary of users like this, for their end-goal is that same race-to-the-bottom mindset. 

Ultimately, it is a race against time on whether the blanketed economic sanctions return Russia to the collapsing soviet union faster than Putin can rally these forces and take his gains... But lingering around every dinner-table in Russia and even among the Oligarchs is: ""How is this worth it to Russia?"" The value of Ukraine in its entirety gained means nothing to the crippling financial costs that will sustain against Russia for years to come, leaving them as isolated and marginalized as North Korea. Even more so, the ironic thing is that if Russia takes Ukraine, that puts their border up against NATO no differently than what they were alleging to care about in the first place. 

**Why did Putin Pick Now?**

Putin is personally living the good life. He has a MASSIVE mansion, yachts, and the balls of a nation largely at his grip. You thought Fox News was bad. Propaganda runs deep in Russia, and dissent is brutally-oppressed. The only thing left for him is cementing his legacy. On the verge of 70, Putin knows his final years are upon him. Whatever action to ensure that legacy and his goals, he must take now. Now consider:


- Trump lost when he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet, for whom he and Oligarchs invested a lot of time and money, would withdraw or defund NATO as Trump publicly and privately floated. 
- Covid further happened, which likely delayed his plans.
- Putin then opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew and engaged with Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- The mud of Spring is fast-approaching, leaving a mechanized offensive vulnerable to further logistical challenges. 
- The domestic grip of a country is slipping, and historically there is no better way to rally domestic control than start a conflict somewhere and start stoking the feelings of Patriotism. Interestingly, this isn't working too well this time, it seems.


There were many things that didn't go as planned for him: dissent among his military; low morale; confusion; logistical challenges; dissent within his borders. The outward propaganda and his online misinformation war got summarily rebuked, and this conflict went on already twice as long as anticipated, according to intelligence. It was supposed to be a blitzkrieg, but now it's going to turn into a financially-draining and publicly-humiliating occupation that could go on for years. The public attention by Western nations got ahead of Russia's plans, seemingly causing them to hesitate and then jump the gun. It bought enough time to bring threatening Anti-Air and Anti-Tank weaponry that significantly delays Russia's advancements. It put Russia in a position where they could only hit targets from afar via cruise-missiles / artillery-strikes. But lurking around every corner are loyal Ukrainian citizens fighting for their homes, wielding weaponry to take out an enemy who isn't even sure why they're there and why they aren't being greeted as liberators. This to me is partly suggested by the fact that 90+ attack-helicopters remained staged on the border of Belarus for so long.

This ultimately seems to fork Russian plans: They either must (a) Continue with the bullshit premise that this isn't an outright war and a special operation intended to mitigate civilian casualties, and thus cannot blatantly bomb city-centers and target the civilians (I know, they have), thereby exposing your true motives, or (b) Sit back with your mechanized infantry and support helicopters and tediously precision-target installations because you're too afraid to advance your tanks and air because of the literally thousands of NLAWS, AT4s, Javelins, and manpads (AA, e.g., stingers) waiting dispersed among the ground.

It was the second day of the war. I was really nervous – we were hearing explosions. I was praying to meet my son. I started to clean everything in my house, preparing for the baby, and even when I started to feel the pain, I couldn’t believe I’d be giving birth during war.

Me and my husband were afraid to drive to the hospital because of the explosions. First we had to spend about 30 minutes in a queue to get gas. Then we were riding through Kyiv and it was empty – I’d never seen such an empty city. We heard the sound of sirens. It was scary, like a movie, but I was trying to stay positive.

When we arrived, all the lights were turned off because hospital staff were afraid about being bombed. My doctor met us and showed us to a very comfortable and colourful room.

But two hours later we heard sirens. It was very loud. It was unreal to look through the window and see all the beautiful Gothic architecture and hear the sirens. While I was pregnant I had taken yoga classes, prepared for gentle birth-giving, took courses. It wasn’t like this.

The doctor said we needed to go to the bomb shelter. There was panic as people were rushing. I couldn’t even put my trousers on because it was too painful. When we entered the shelter we were shocked. It was built in Soviet times and wasn’t maintained, it was crumbling and very wet and cold.

For us there was a small room without any doors, only a shower curtain that separated us from the main room with 50 people in it. There was no medical technology, just a gynaecological chair. I was trying to not even look over there and hoping to go back to the hospital soon.

Then my waters broke. My doctor looked at me and said: “OK, we will do it here, it’s too dangerous to wait.” At that moment I wasn’t afraid. I trusted my doctor – the only thing on my mind was holding my son and ending the pain.

Basically, United Nations resolutions are formal expressions of the opinion or will of United Nations organs. About the Draft Resolution itself,  


\> Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the draft text determines that the situation in Ukraine constitutes a breach of international peace and security, and that Russia has committed acts of aggression against Ukraine. It appears that during the negotiations, China expressed a preference for a Chapter VI resolution. (Chapter VI addresses the pacific settlement of disputes and Chapter VII deals with threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression. Chapter VII allows the Council, once it determines a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace or an act of aggression, to take measures, including the use of force.)  


\> The draft resolution also reaffirms the Council’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and condemns Russia’s military operation. In this regard, the text decides that Russia shall immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine and completely withdraw its military forces from within Ukraine’s internationally recognised borders. Condemning Russia’s decision to recognise the independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, the draft resolution decides that Russia should unconditionally reverse its decision and work towards the full implementation of the Minsk agreements.

Ghebreyesus told a press conference that the WHO is working to verify the reports of “attacks on health facilities and health workers”, and said attacks on healthcare would be “in violation of international humanitarian law”.

The sanctity and neutrality of healthcare, including of health workers, patient supplies, transport and facilities, and the right to safe access to care must be respected and protected.

The WHO confirmed a report last week in which a hospital came under attack from heavy weapons, killing four people and injuring 10, including six health workers, the WHO chief said.

It's going to effect economies around the world. It's going to affect the future. Saying this now to the people in the future who will all insist nobody was saying it.

We all know this. People aren't ignorant of this. Part of the reason everybody is watching this is the knowledge that there will be unintended consequences.

Anybody taking a reasonable look at this situation in terms of the degree of escalation, though - the nuclear threats, the missiles, the shock and awe, the paratroopers - should not be surprised that economic escalation was also going to happen, and that it would also cause a lot of damage in return. It was never going to be the case that Russia was going to escalate and escalate and escalate in these theatrical ways and never run into any big error or pushback or blowback, just as it was never going to be the case that the West was going to keep expanding its influence in Eastern Europe and Russia was never going to do anything, just as it was never going to be the case that the Soviet Union was going to run a multi-state centrally planned, closed economy and have it not eventually collapse leading to the predictable expansion of the influence and ambitions of their neighbors. It all makes sense. The problems exist and they can't be unmade.

But they didn't have to be managed this way, with this escalation. It's a meaningful change with clear agency.

So please don't come here in a year or two years and say Joe Biden or NATO had some great other option they didn't use and because they didn't everything that happened is by their hand only - or that they should have just ""not done"" what they did because you can imagine an impossible scenario where nothing else happened - if you think the West can influence Russia and shape its behavior, then you must also think that Russia can do the same to the West, and Russia has been calling a lot of the shots here - even to the point of denying that anybody else has any right to call shots at all.

And the reason you don't just roll tanks into places - other than care for human life and there being more helpful things to do with your time - is because the escalation becomes mutual and hard to stop with tons of follow-on consequences. Brinksmanship games don't just end with people folding all the time, and it's not reasonable to expect they would.

Of course there was going to be extended conflict over Ukraine. Of course there was. But it didn't have to be this. And the difference is the invasion.",1646237781.0,1646237561.0,t3_t51poq,t3_t51poq,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

I'm seeing a lot of people getting understandably excited about all the news around Russia's economy failing, the apparent disjointedness or reluctance of the Russian military, the convoy being stalled, the strength of the Ukrainian resistance, and so on.

But I think it's really, really important that people, particularly people on social media and especially here on reddit, appreciate something:

All of these little individual stories we see on social media are excellent moral boosters and they're very, very important to share so Ukraine can keep winning the information war against Russian propagandists.

But they are still not the whole picture. The outlook on all of this, coming directly from US intelligence and defense analysts, is still grim. If Putin doesn't pull back, and it is unlikely he will, there is still a very real chance, even a likely chance, Kyiv will be encircled and this will result in Zelensky's capture or death. 

Putin will be cutting off his own arm to do this, make no mistake, and Ukraine will absolutely not be held by Russia in the long term, but that does not mean he can't or won't keep pushing until he takes the objective. Without air support and more manpower, Ukraine can only slow the invasion, it is unlikely they can completely halt it for long. This only ends when the Russians stop, whether by Putin's direct order or some other reason.

I don't say this to be defeatist, but I do think people need to be prepared for bad news in the next week. It isn't a certainty, but this is far from over and the worst is yet to come.",1646233588.0,1646233140.0,t3_t51poq,t3_t51poq,,0,25,0,25,0,0,

This is… not good. I was speculating earlier that they were in fact getting ready to switch strategies after their idiotic stroll into Ukraine didn’t work out, finally acknowledge that it was a war, and eventually announce martial law. This would also add credence to the claim via Ukraine intel that Russia is planning on staging a false flag attack either today or tomorrow.   

People are laughing now, but such a scenario would be very bad. Along with the Belarusian representative saying that the sanctions would impact “everyone” and the Kremlin not even denying that said sanctions would be harmful to Russia at all- all this suggests that the Kremlin is planning on propagandizing the war as an attack on Russia by the West/NATO with Ukraine as its proxy. 

This would also lead many, many Russian citizens who were opposed to the war based on economics, to rethink said opposition, and further radicalize them against the West as well, and finally give many soldiers a reason to be angry and kill Ukrainians.",1646240322.0,1646240217.0,t3_t51poq,t3_t51poq,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

First of all, impossible that Russia can sustain it for that long. They either win quickly or peace out. 

Another problem is that Ukraine is not ideal for guerrilla warfare. It's not a massive mountainy region like Afghanistan, or a huge jungle, like Vietnam. With today's technology it is almost impossible to conduct military operations on a huge plain like Ukraine without being detected by planes, satellites, or just people with smartphones. I don't think Ukraine will be capable of major military resistance if the big cities fall. Russia would have plenty of time to slowly clean up the remaining units going village by village, using their air force mostly. 

That being said, I'm not sure that Russia can actually defeat Ukraine completely before they have to quit the war. I wouldn't be shocked if the war's unpopularity and the economic cost were too much to bear. I expect Ukraine and Russia to make peace eventually. 

What kind of peace? I don't think that Zelenskyy would let Crimea go, but I also don't think that Russia would give it up. If the Russians were to succeed at removing the current leadership from the picture, I can see the new government basically giving up Donbas and Crimea.

The best case scenario is that the Russian offensive will collapse due to bad logistics and low morale. I think that's still wishful thinking. Worst case scenario is a complete Ukrainian defeat and annexation by Russia. I don't think either is very likely. 

Even a victory would be a huge problem for Russia. Trying to subjugate 40 million people won't work. The country would be crippled under the economic burden, so annexation can't be a real option. 

Another thing to consider is that the Russian troops might be unwilling to kill civilians and commit war crimes now, but the longer this war goes on, the more that will change. Over time the dehumanization of the enemy is unavoidable. Eventually they will realize that the sooner they crush the resistance, the sooner they can go home. That's the sad reality of war.

Could it be the case that their nuclear weapons are old, deteriorated, and wouldn't even work properly decades after they were built?
Perhaps Putin's weapons is just a bluff, he has nothing? If so, this is a window of opportunity here for the US to strike with all it's conventional firepower and get rid of the Russian Political Oligarchy/Communist menace once and for all from history.

Putin has demonstrated that he is comfortable lying and inventing false pretenses to move forward with his domination of europe. If he wants to use nuclear weapons, do you think he'll wait for a ""legitimate"" reason like the west overreaching or make up an excuse to get his way? 

Do we continue to allow megalomaniacs to roam free, forever?

Yay or Nay?

**Countermeasures**

* don't repeat the disinformation
* repeating the counterinformation
* providing an alternative story to fill in the gaps created when false ""facts"" are removed
* forewarning people about propaganda, highlighting the ways propagandists manipulate public opinion
* countering the effects of propaganda, rather than the propaganda itself; for example, to counter propaganda that undermines support for a cause, work to boost support for that cause rather than refuting the propaganda directly

Sanctions will remain and deescalation off the table until hostilities stop. But he needs a strategic victory if he wants to survive at home. 

As for their economy, it's in for a deep recession even if the conflict ends tomorrow. The ruble could become something of an internal currency, simply to manage trade. People won't be happy, but in other places in the world, with economies who have hyperinflation (venezuela) and are in the midst of an economic crisis, their leadership has the military to crush domestic unrest, I mean look at Maduro. 

So, with the world throwing up a wall cutting RU off, they won't be able to throw the latest weaponry at the conflict or anything like that, but RU will throw meat and metal at Kyiv if Putin still eyes Kyiv as a strategic goal and feels their internal red lines are not yet crossed.

All of Russias military industry is state owned and Russia produces all the fuel and food the country needs within Russia already. The only things they lack are some sophisticated parts, but Russia could simply reverse engineer the ones they have and make copies.

War is a combination of will and capability, So long as the Russian population and military does not revolt, the war will continue because Russia still has the capability to fight it.

Could Russia collapse due to revolution? It's certainly a possibility, but those estimates assume Russia does not and continues to fight. 

With that in mind, the estimates are logical. They also show that Russia will still lose despite all that simply due to the will of the Ukranians. Ten to twenty years is a long time, eventually the war will become so unpopular/costly that Russia will have to pull out. 

Will is arguably more important than capability in war. The United States wars are perfect examples of this. In both Vietnam and afganistan the United States had the capability advantage by light years, yet they still lost in the end because those they were fighting never gave up.

Main topic -> side topic doesn't.

A headline that says ""Crypto is bypassing sanctions aimed at influencing the Russian invasion of Ukraine"" makes sense. Ultimately the topic is the war in Ukraine. The sanctions are discussed in the context of how they influence the war, and now crypto is being discussed in a direct line of consequence for how it can disrupt those sanctions.

But if you go in reverse and talk about how the war is influencing the price of crypto, and how this may bring about new regulations or whatever, I don't think that belongs here. That is a good topic for a crypto thread. Ultimately your topic is crypto and you're discussing how the war affects crypto. It's the reverse of the above.

Same with all the things you brought up. Threat of WW3 is influencing this conflict as nations aren't engaging as they might if they weren't worried about it. Also they're uniting pretty strongly politically perhaps also because of the threat of WW3. That seems to fit. 

US politicians -> Ukraine war make sense. 

US politicians <- Ukraine war doesn't.

If you say ""xyz senator says he will block funding humanitarian aid for Ukraine due to party politics"", I think that makes sense to be here, you're talking about how party politics will affect the war.

It's hard. But if we escalate first, we risk backing Putin into a corner. For all of his whining to the contrary, he's not backed into a corner yet. He started this, he escalated this, he can stop it any time and save whatever face he still has. All we've done so far is levy the consequences we told him he would face should he choose to invade. None of this should be a surprise to him.

That becomes infinitely more difficult once we start being aggressive and escalate further without him doing so first. What's happening is horrifying but the consequences of mishandling our reaction would be even more horrifying.

No matter how bad a situation is, it can *always* be made worse. This is judo, not chess.

Edit: What I'm suggesting isn't appeasement. He stays in Ukraine, the sanctions remain and we should keep loading more on him as this progresses. If he attacks a NATO country, all bets are off and we should hit him with everything we got. He escalates to nuclear strikes, then I guess we're going to have ourselves a little atomic rodeo.

We don't escalate, but we also don't back off at any point unless he backs off.

Russia is very tech savy, there are still people out there uninformed sure. But I'd also classify you in that boat despite you living in a civilized nation.

I personally sent BTC and ETH last night to my wallet in under 2 mins time each for about $1.80 in fees (gas is cheaper late at night, fees on Ethereum are priced by traffic like an UBER ride is). 

BTC has had a few major forks (updates) since 2018 to reduce the fees and speed things up via ""Lightning network""

You may be misled about all that. Don't get me wrong ETH has some high fees regarding swaps of ERC20 tokens, for now until 2.0 update, and sending other ETH based tokens (essentially a lof of the shitcoins out there like SHIBA INU are just tokens created ON the Ethereum blockchain...like a subreddit vs Reddit as a whole).

The Russian modus operandi, as per Dugin's [Geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics) and the mistakenly published [victory article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-60562240) coming out of Russian state media the other day has been based on recovering Russia's place as one of the major world powers. This is a normal goal for such a huge country to aim for. On paper (as in in terms of population, resources, miltary, regional influence or any combination of these) the major geopolitical powers of the world should probably be the USA, Brazil, Argentina, EU, Egypt, Russia, China, India. In practice since the Cold War it has been the USA with the EU a potential rival, and one which is an ally, and then China. India also emerging and Egypt starting to make very strong moves but they are not there yet. Brazil and Argentina are chronically mismanaged.

In the context of the two documents I linked we can see how it has been in Russia's interests to divide Europe and USA internally. This gives credence to the claims of Russian interference in western politics. From the perspective of the current administration in Russia, there are peoples who are ethnically and culturally Russian in Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and perhaps other countries and they must be brought back into the fold to form part of the globally important Russia in this new world.

I believe this is why Russia has chosen now to invade Ukraine like this. The west looked weaker than ever. Brexit, the cost of living crisis, racial tensions spiking in the USA. Boris Johnson has been extremely lucky to still be in a job given the past few months. I think they underestimated how strongly and how quickly the west would be able to come together.

From their perspective any efforts to move Ukraine towards the west (EU and/or NATO) are essentially hostile since they count Ukraine as lost territory which needs to be brought back. The 2014 revolution/s in Ukraine were started and won by Ukranian nationalists - among them ultranationalists such as Azov, Right Sector etc. I have no proof, but given the history of the USA and UK funding, arming and training the Mujahadeen in their fight against the USSR in the 80s only to fight these same people themselves in the 00s - I wouldn't be surprised if the west did support the more militant far-right in Ukraine.

The thing is that post-revolution in Ukraine these groups barely won any seats in parliament. They are electorally insignificant. I can't tell you how prominent their capacity for influence from 'the streets' is, but I imagine it's not huge. It could be that Putin has convinced himself that these militias are in control of Ukraine or maybe he's just using it as an excuse. He can't simply invade saying he's there to reunite Russia and Ukraine because that's the opposite of what the west wants (also the opposite of what Ukranians seem to want!) and they wouldn't stand for that. I think Putin gambled they'd buy the nazi thing a little more.

His 'you left us no choice' thing from his point of view I think is because he sees EU/Nato expansion eastward as being hostile to Russia- because they consider it to be a western annexation of a russian province (Ukraine I mean) and therefore undermining Russia's rightful (to their view) position as a global leader.

Investments in the Russian economy (as long as they’re in rubles) will be seen as EXTREMELY risky, making investments unlikely unless they are viewed as a donation or type of aid (something you’re not expected to get back). 

Think of it like this: generally speaking, 90% of transactions are made on “fake money” which is debt.  For a bank (like PNC) it creates $10 of economic activity for every dollar it has in its actual bank accounts.  This is all done because everyone believes in a financial system where (generally speaking) people pay back debt.  A government default COMPLETELY destroys that belief, because what should be the most reliable borrower in the country cannot pay its loans back. It results in a massive economic contraction as everyone stops loaning money (theoretically could slow it up to 90%).

•Huge scandals were caused by Blavatnik's charity projects, in particular, the investment of £75 million to Oxford University, which not only accepted his money but also named a new unit after him. The decision to accept Blavatnik’s money in Oxford was made by people implicated in oligarchic scandals and financial fraud themselves.

•According to a number of experts, Leonard Blavatnik earned the main assets in Russia, thanks to his friendship with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman, as well as his close relations to the Russian leadership and FSB, and personally making a profit from their illegal actions.

•Illegal enrichment at the expense of Russian taxpayers due to his close relations to the Kremlin; corruption of the Western elites in the interests of the Putin regime.

•According to Ilya Zaslavsky, a former consultant to TNK-BP, the best illustration is the sale of TNK-BP to Rosneft, as a result of which Blavatnik received about $7 billion: “Blavatnik and his oligarchic comrades from the Alfa Access Renova (AAR) consortium joined forces with Russian security services and other government agencies, including the main pro-Kremlin media in a government-sponsored baiting campaign to oust BP from the TNK-BP joint venture in 2008-2009.” As a result, “in 2012-2013, the government-controlled Rosneft bought back a stake from Kremlin-related oligarchs for $30 billion in cash through payments via offshore accounts, while the market value of AAR’s stake was about $20 billion.” Blavatnik is not just a businessman, but an insider of the Russian system. Zaslavsky also indicates that Blavatnik’s company Amediateka is featured in the Panama Papers as having a joint venture with former Russian Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Makhonov.

That's what our propaganda convinces you of, like in Lybia. ""The people fighting against the tyrant they don't want"".

It was the will of the protesters you saw in Kiev and Lvov.

Eastern Ukraine definitely didn't share the same feelings as the protesters you've seen in maidan square.

Also, even after months of protests [more ukrainians disapproved of maidan than those that approved](https://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine-politics/more-ukrainians-disapprove-of-euromaidan-protests-than-approve-of-it-poll-336461.html).

So because the Ruble is experiencing such significant volatility, it makes the day-to-day price changes of other currencies (including gold) fairly immaterial. So for purposes of explanation, let’s assume they don’t move at ALL. 

Dollar to Gold holds steady, as well as dollar to every other currency including euro:gold. 

The Russians would theoretically need to pay off its Eurobonds with rubles or gold. Say they sell all the gold in the next 2 weeks and pay off 80% of its debt with gold. The other 20% would still need to be paid off with rubles. Rubles have devalued so significantly that the 20% they need to pay off, will require substantially more rubles than just a week ago. This effectively makes their debt bill significantly larger for the Russian government (by making their cash reserves and new cash collections worth less). 

215 -> 400 was assuming they don’t use gold to pay down foreign debt (which is pretty likely btw, I bet they save the gold for buying hard goods like food). The Ruble is down 40%, which is worse than it sounds bc of how the math works 1/(1-40%)

Regarding funding NATO:

>All 30 Allies contribute to the NATO budget on an agreed cost-share formula based on Gross National Income, which represents a small percentage of each member’s defence budget. This is the principle of common funding, and demonstrates burden-sharing in action.

It seems this is done in proportionality, which seems reasonable.

Additionally, it should be noted that the bolstering of NATO was actively a part of US Foreign Policy for literally decades. In other words, *we wanted to fund it* heavily in order to ensure that chiefly Russia during the cold war didn't establish their grip in the region. USA, after all, was one of the co-creators of the alliance post-WWII with a vested motive themselves. 

It is outright odd and downright suspicious that Trump started peddling this Anti-NATO sentiment, both in terms of the funding, and beginning to threaten total withdrawal. Makes me wonder what he'd do if he won his second term... Fortunately, NATO withdrawal was so unpopular that it spelled doom to his 2020 run if he did it during his first term, I suspect.

Regarding the pipeline, yes I can say that it's canceled now because three-months-ago, Russia hadn't outright invaded Ukraine apart from supporting the ""separatists"".

If they install a puppet regime and leave they will be overthrown. Ukrainian history is full of shit like this. Unless the Russians kill every Ukrainian I don't see this stopping.

The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov. A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915.

As someone who served, you know damn well that war isn't a humanitarian mission. You don't get the luxury of saving a school bus full of children if its going to sabotage the mission. There are times where that school bus is an intended distraction or, even worse, a trap.

We have a strategy in place. These are some of the heaviest sanctions that have ever been levied against a nation. Russia's economy is a crashing basketcase and, if it pushes further, it's going to have a costly occupation on top of that. 

*Don't you understand that our enemy has already set the conditions for its own destruction without us escalating with actions that would back it into the type of corner that might justify nuclear action.*

If that weren't the case, I'd be more inclined to agree with you. *But it is.*

Now, chances are that Russia will reach a point where they threaten us with military action or nuclear strike to call off the sanctions. That's where we hold firm and take it to war if necessary and, yes, even escalate up to the brink of nuclear retaliation and beyond if we must. 

But we're *already winning* with what we're doing now. We risk the mission if we try to save the school bus of children that *is* Ukraine. War has awful casualties and sometimes you allow for those in order to seize the greater victory. They eat at you every day afterwards but that's the cost of war.

It sucks but, like I've said, it is the only recourse we have to put pressure on Putin's administration. Weak sanctions that hurt the Russian economy but only minimally do nothing.

>just because they MIGHT rise up against Putin.

Again, they will. If 144 million people realise their life savings are gone and they can't afford food, they will revolt.

This is a fact. There is no MIGHT about it. Their only other option is to starve which most humans aren't too thrilled about. Mass revolts. Killing of officials. Calls for Putin's removal. All of these would be inevitable.

Putin and his puppet masters will give up their war if they know that these are becoming increasingly likely.
