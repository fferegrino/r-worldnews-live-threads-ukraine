Day 230 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was much quieter than yesterday, there was no shelling and no missile or drone strikes. We still had some times when there was no electricity, but this time it was because of scheduled outages to conduct repairs. We had a couple of outages during the day, each time for different districts of the city. For our district it was at around 10am, for some others it happened at 7:40-50pm, and there’s another one planned for tomorrow in some parts of the city.

They still fired quite a lot of missiles at our cities today, I’m pretty sure it was around 20-30 this time, most of which were shot down. When air defenses are not being saturated by dozens of missiles at a time, like yesterday, it’s much easier to intercept those missiles when they are flying at us one by one. 

Apparently the first Iris-T system arrived today, so let’s how it will compare to the old Soviet AA which we were using up till now. Though I’m not sure where it will be placed, these days Kharkiv is not being rained with missiles nearly as much as before, so we don’t exactly *need it* here now. It might go to Zaporizhzhia because they are getting hit with missiles a lot recently, so placing new AA there could be a good decision.

It was nice seeing a substation in Belgorod oblast having a “smoking incident” and blowing up, leaving some thousands of people with no electricity. I’m looking forward to seeing more careless smoking incidents on substations in Russia. I don’t know what they were expecting, that we won’t hit them back? Well, yes they did, that was what they thought when they first invaded, they thought they would be welcomed as liberators. But it’s baffling that they *still* think we won’t be hitting them back even after 8 months of war.",False,1665535662.0,t3_y0z2g2,t3_y0z2g2,,0,150,0,150,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

>I think that we Europeans are facing a situation in which we suffer the consequences of a process that has been lasting for years in which we have decoupled the sources of our prosperity from the sources of our security.
>
>Our prosperity has been based on cheap energy coming from Russia. Russian gas – cheap and supposedly affordable, secure, and stable. It has been proved not [to be] the case. And the access to the big China market, for exports and imports, for technological transfers, for investments, for having cheap goods.
>
>So, our prosperity was based on China and Russia – energy and market. Clearly, today, we have to find new ways for energy from inside the European Union, as much as we can, because we should not change one dependency for another. The best energy is the one that you produce at home.
>
>The access to China is becoming more and more difficult. The adjustment will be tough, and this will create political problems.
>
>On the other hand, we delegated our security to the United States. While the cooperation with the Biden Administration is excellent, and the transatlantic relationship has never been as good as it is today – [including] our cooperation with the United States and my friend Tony [Anthony] Blinken [US Secretary of State]: we are in a fantastic relationship and cooperating a lot; who knows what will happen two years from now, or even in November? 
>
>These are some questions that we have to ask ourselves. And the answer for me is clear: we need to shoulder more responsibilities ourselves. We have to take a bigger part of our responsibility in securing security. 
>
>You - the United States - take care of our security. You - China and Russia – provided the basis of our prosperity. This is a world that is no longer there. 
>
>So, we have a difficult cocktail – internal and external – and the old recipes do not work anymore. We have mounting security challenges and our internal cohesion is under threat.
>
>Some things have happened in the past that we knew they could happen, but some of them have been a surprise. 
>
>First, how not? Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has persisted. We did not foresee how effectively Ukraine would resist. First, we did not believe that the war was coming. I have to recognise that here, in Brussels, the Americans were telling us “They will attack, they will attack”, and we were quite reluctant to believe it. And I remember very well when [US Secretary of State] Tony Blinken phoned me and told me “well, it is going to happen this weekend”. And certainly, two days later, at five o’clock in the morning, they started bombing Kyiv. We did not believe that this was going to happen, and we did not foresee that Ukraine was ready to resist as fiercely and as successfully as they are doing.

I guess the easiest method is to remove the track bedding, cut some steel locally to perform tests in a lab to see the properties of the steel.  


In another method they could use some Finete element model like DIANA FEA but i remember it was very hard to use for complex structures.  


I just hope gasoline spilled trough the track bed and really damaged the structure under the tracks:

&#x200B;

A good fire can reach 1200 degrees, but steel only melts around 1500 degrees. The weakening of steel does not require melting either; the microscopic changes that occur in the steel, such as the growth of steel crystals, are sufficient to weaken the steel. In a very intense fire, the temperature of the steel becomes so hot . above 720 degrees Celsius - that new steel crystals are formed with a different crystal structure. This complicates the predictability of the behavior of steel during a fire. With sustained fire, these crystals grow, resulting in weakening. The higher the temperature, the faster crystals grow and the easier it is to deform the steel.",False,1665523801.0,t3_y0z2g2,t3_y0z2g2,,0,22,0,22,0,0,

So close to 80 missiles in total (some sources claimed over 100 in total, but let's be a little sceptical). I counted 9 hits. 

Worst part for Russia - Kh-101 is pretty new missile and they were ramping up production in last years. Yearly they can produce maybe 200 - if everything will go right - 300 Kh-101s.

I'm speculating here, but expect things in Russia to get much worse in the upcoming months.

In reality, prices do get lower in Russia during summer for food products etc. But when winter come, Russia has to rely on imports.

I hope that pointing it out for what it is and doing analysis about it, will prove to be useful in removing its effects. 

Today’s latest propaganda effort is showing examples of US and Ukrainian bombing campaigns.

Similar videos of Donbas explosions post 2014 are also going around.

The catch: the argument is moot. Even if we accept that the Americans or Ukrainians committed war crimes, Russia’s retaliatory strikes on civilian centers is still a terrorist attack and a war crime. Attacks on civilian infrastructure is wrong. The Americans (a non-combatant in the war) doing a war crime does not make it acceptable to commit them yourself

One of the claims of the Russians for why they are invading Ukraine is “in response to the Ukrainian war crimes in the Donbas.” This claim becomes ridiculous on its face if you proceed to bomb playgrounds in retaliatory strikes

What Putin has done and what pundits love talking about is the rhetorical corner that Putin has deliberately painted himself in to with his words. He’s done this deliberately to create the narrative that he is “backed in to a corner.” But he’s not.



Putin does well in these rhetorical battles of narratives, it’s no wonder that he wants to fight on that battlefield. But he fucked up. When he launched his full-scale invasion he chose to leave the war of words in favor of a real war.

&nbsp;
I've heard enough from ruzians to know how they really feel. They DO NOT blindly trust in propaganda aside from very old boomers or people who genuinely gave up on life. They are actively a vile, xenophobic and vengeful group of people, and I picked words carefully here. Not everyone of course, but the ones who are - they drown everybody else out and majority of decent ruzians sit quietly in the corner. First rule, every offense done to their mighty country needs to be punished 100-fold. They have pretty good idea of what is happening and the propaganda is just a convenient way to sidestep moral boundaries. Same way nazis just ""followed orders"".

&nbsp;
 These degenerates are gleeful that they are terrorizing civilians. Constantly, on Ukrainian music videos they will post disgusting shit like they can't wait when their ""musicians"" (Wagner) will defile/rape so and so female artist, and I see these comments all the time, especially on Tik Tok. Tik Tok is cancer, but sadly many soldiers/""influencers"" use it and every comment section will be 50 % a stew of nastiest shit imaginable with ruzians describing what acts they wanna see in the future. 

&nbsp;
When they will lose the war, they will inevitably cry and play ""victims of propaganda"" card and I don't want anyone falling for it and giving them benefit of doubt.

&nbsp;
Edit: just to clarify on why what we see is more than just propaganda campaign. If you follow ruzian news and listen to their hot takes , you will realize they have no one direction and struggle to make a point. A lot of propaganda shows consist of circus freaks arguing and talking over each other. It's entertainment and filler, not brainwashing. They will downplay things that could actually make people angry. 

&nbsp;
The ruzian can also easily fact check any sensational or fishy bs. They don't have language barrier or some great firewall stopping them from lurking. Ukrainians are more than happy to educate them. Very often, they even have friends and relatives across the border. They don't wanna hear none of that. What they want is to win at any cost and then rewrite history.

Oh Mr. ""I understand war"", please enlighten me how this means that Russia is winning. Saudi-Arabia is nothing in comparison to the west. What could they give Russia that would really help them? Russia doesn't need oil, they need advanced technology to keep producing their military machinery and rockets (so they don't have to buy from North Korea and Iran). 
How exactly does bombing civilians help the Russian war effort? Spoiler: it doesn't, it just depletes their already low running stockpiles.
And how exactly is Russia escalating? They have drawn so many red lines (first ""no Western involvement"", then ""no heavy weapons"", then ""no long range HIMARS"", then ""no attack on Russian territory"", then ""no attack on Kerch bridge"") and Ukraine and the west crossed all of them? Putin is as impotent as his own military and cannot enforce any of the ""red lines"" they have drawn.
At the same time, Ukraine is kicking their asses in the area that really counts: the battlefield. Russian troops are fleeing faster than Ukraine can advance, the fronts are collapsing, men are fleeing Russia, and rusty old Soviet equipment is distributed.
Russia's shelling of civilians does nothing but galvanize western support. It's nothing but the temper tantrum of a bully that finally found someone to stand up to them.

-----


**++**   Ceiling for Russian oil prices (strongly reduces the ability to finance Putin's war)

**--**   Only 30 individuals in the list of sanctions (there are names in the list that should have been sanctioned 100 years ago / Navalny's team suggests over 6000 people to be sanctioned but also given a way out by leaving Putin / right now Europe is sanctioning a few people but also not giving them a way out so they stick even closer to Putin)

**++**   Ban on providing Russia with consulting/architecture IT services (strong hit against Putin's operations)

**--**   No ban on Russian diamonds (ALROSA - one of Putin's closest friends owns it and earns a lot of money for Putin by selling Russian diamonds and will continue to do so)

**--**   Ban on Russians owning Crypto (dont understand whom of Putin's friends this causes pain to / right now Russia's central bank allows to withdraw a million US dollars per day, any Putin friend just opened a bank account in Dubai and they have legally been sending their money over there /  crypto was needed for Russian dissidents, independent journalists, those that worked with opposition political parties against Putin - they all needed to somehow get money and crypto was a safe way, consider this to be a counterproductive to EU's goals.)

How is it possible that one country is attacking the other and they are not automatically at war?

It's kind of shocking to me that people some people are so gullible they can't identify that Musk is almost always wrong, almost always offering stupid ideas, has never invented anything new, has never contributed an original engineering idea, has never personally solved an important engineering problem, and has never demonstrated himself in public to have any meaningful degree of intelligence. He's exclusively been making moronic statements, proposing obviously idiotic ideas, and taking credit for publicly talking about concepts and ideas that were thought up over a century ago without actually offering anything new or original to improve them.

There is literally no redeeming quality, no hidden intellect, nothing underneath. He took inherited wealth and bought out other people's work so he can coast on their efforts.

Russia says it is open to talks with the West about Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says his country has not yet received an invitation after the US White House suggested on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not be ready for a meeting.  
A spokesman for US President Joe Biden said, according to ABC News, that the war in Ukraine must end and that the two camps must therefore come to the table. But Putin is said to have given no indication that he is ready for a ""diplomatic and peaceful solution"".  
""That's a lie,"" according to Lavrov. ""If there is a proposal, we will consider it."" If it is up to the foreign minister, a meeting between Putin and Biden is possible at next month's G20 summit.  
Putin will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Kazakhstan on Thursday, the Kremlin said. When asked whether Erdogan should lead the talks between Russia and the West, Lavrov replied that the Turkish president can propose this to Putin at the meeting in Kazakhstan. This was organized by the consultation group CICA, of which 26 Asian countries and one African country (Egypt) are members.

>Even as Biden scrambles to hold together his global coalition, cracks are showing in political support at home for the billions in aid the United States is sending Ukraine. Those fissures are likely to widen significantly if Republicans recapture the House on Nov. 8.

>A Pew Research poll shows that the share of Americans who are extremely or very concerned about a Ukrainian defeat fell from 55 percent in May to 38 percent in September. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 32 percent say the United States is providing too much support for the war — up from 9 percent in March.

And:

>Early in the war, Zelensky called repeatedly and publicly on the United States and other Western countries to do more — to send additional weapons and impose harsher sanctions on Russia — even as Biden and Congress were already sending unprecedented amounts of aid and advanced weapons to Kyiv.

>Biden understood as a fellow politician that Zelensky had to advocate forcefully for his people, but he also told the Ukrainian leader privately that it would be hard for him to keep asking Congress for money if Zelensky appeared ungrateful and kept saying it was not enough, according to a former White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.

Russia's claim of only 6,000ish a few months ago is likely very low (or does not include *any* Wagner/separatists etc.).  If total Russian/Merc/separatist losses totalled 6,000, and maybe twice as many wounded, then they wouldn't need to order a mobilization. Plus, the confirmed vehicle losses suggest higher casualties than this. I suppose 6,000 Russian military deaths and 10,000-15,000 more Wagner/separatist deaths *might* be plausible. Even then, their confirmed vehicle losses seem a bit high even for that (though maybe most were abandoned?).

Meanwhile, Ukraine's published losses look unrealistically high due to the fact that if twice as many have been wounded, then the Russians would have collapsed utterly already (they'd be down to less than 30% of their total initial invasion force! And they haven't replaced their forces at that high of a rate).

The liberals currently have a *very tenuous* grasp on power that might well officially end in an elections next month. Now, and this is important, the conservatives exploit *every opportunity* to show liberal action as misguided treason, and their loyal base of let's say 40% to 50% of the voting public swallows it all up. This is how it is with auth-conservatives: they just consume twitter takes by pundits and internalize them. In the US they were told vaccines are terrible, so that's what they believe. In Israel they were told vaccines are amazing, so that's what they believe. It's just how it is.

Since the liberals backed Ukraine *of course* the conservative psy-op war machine immediately adopted a contrarian position where saying or doing anything to anger Putin is treason, and is subservience to US interests over national interests. So while PM Lapid is technically speaking a great supporter of Ukraine, he is under effective public opinion siege: everything he does to favor Ukraine costs him with the war machine immediately riling the zombie 40% with the whole ""poking the bear is treason"" narrative. Even condemning the missile attacks cost him dearly, the bots and the useful idiots are in full force right now everywhere in the news and on social media trying to make him bleed for it.

In conclusion Israel's political system is fucked right now and liberals are just scared shitless. Their ability to maintain power is very ephemeral anyway; any mis-step or mis-use of public goodwill and it slips away further. Too much Russian money and effort has been spilled into the public arena here, and, crucially, the local conservatives being in on it sealed the deal in Putin's favor: Israel is paralyzed and can't support Ukraine fully.

And that's not all either, it's probably a fair assumption cracks have formed, or will form, in the concrete. As a result water can flow into these cracks which if it freezes can cause even more damage due to ice expanding.

Energy in Europe is anything but cheap compared to the international competition.

Our prosperity was never based on having cheaper access to energy than other parts of the world, it just needed energy prices to be ""not much higher"". All yes for more sustainability and more diverse sources of oil&gas but european companies are already competing (on the world market) while paying more for energy. 

And the part of our industry which will survive the next few years will have a massive competitive edge over the rest of the world if they ever decide to battle climate change.

In addition to that, Russia has demanded that countries buying its main exports, oil and gas, pay in rubles, which drives up demand.  

In the end though, the exchange rate means less than ever because Russia has become isolated.  Both imports and exports dropped significantly since before the war.  The ruble may be stronger, but there isn't much that Russians can buy with it from the outside world.

The concrete deck was saw-cut and removed because it’s not possible to know whether the steel reinforcing inside was compromised.  So this repair was a precaution.  New metal deck forms were placed, and a new concrete deck cast.  The steel superstructure was inspected and determined to not be compromised.  Idk what method they used to determine this.

All of the usual non-destructive tests check for physical material defects; cracks, welds that aren’t fully penetrated, or material thicknesses that you can’t otherwise measure.  So to test if the steel reached a sufficient temperature to have been weakened, I think you have to remove a small section for lab testing and install a patch.

If it’s determined the bridge steel was compromised they probably will have the choice of closing it for repairs or simply de-rating it’s capacity until such time that repairs can be made.  Of course they’ll choose the latter.

The US has 450+ patriot AA launchers in active service, and has been operating and selling them for several decades. Multiple other NATO countries have them in active service as do the Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese military. And they are plainly a completely defensive technology, they shoot down incoming planes and missiles, that's all they are for. They are readily transportable and there are a substantial number already in Europe within a days drive of Ukraine. 

If the US and NATO wanted to they could, within a matter of days put fully crewed patriot batteries in and around Kiev and the other major cities, well away from the front line or combat zones , with ukrainian infantry units assigned to protect them just to be safe. Hell if someone wearing a UN blue helmet wants to ride along or perhaps some of those heroically impartial defenders of human rights from amnesty international to verify they are purely trying to protect the airspace from incoming missiles, that would be fine.

Russia would no doubt bitch and moan but so what?  a) their propaganda is already telling everyone that NATO troops are actually fighting on the frontline so it's hard to see what the hell they could actually say they haven't already b) noone could rationally think that an AA battery is escalatory- it is plainly an exclusively defensive piece of equipment meant to protect airspace and stop civilians from getting killed by russian cruise missiles. Like what are they actually going to say? How dare you attempt to defend cities from our missile strikes?! 

Or if that's considered too risky, given how long and how widely they have been in use there are literally thousands of ex military in the US and elsewhere, who have worked with the patriot system. For the right price you could recruit multiple battalions and send them in as contractors.

They were defacto at war, but it was in both sides interest to keep it low level. Russia didn't want a full blown war, like the current one, because it would get a reaction. They were in no rush - after all, if the situation changed they could escalate, safe in the knowledge that they could crush Ukraine with ease. 

Ukraine meanwhile was in dire straits. The Ukrainian military at the time was nothing like what they ended up within in Feb. Their military was shambolic, a joke that made the current russian conscripts look like special forces. They needed time, and they needed time when Russia wasn't going at them full pelt. 

So both sides accepted the quiet lie, and kept it localised to east Ukraine. Ukraine was quietly very, very vocal about the need for support and the issue, but they didn't want to set things into high gear until they were able to complete the reforms to their military. There was also the recognition that if it escalated, the majority of the cost would be absorbed by the Ukrainian people. 

So: Russia pretends it’s not a major war because if it was, then things escalate into a confrontation they don't need at the time. Ukraine has a dual issue where they recognise it as a war, but don't want to make too much fuss while they desperately try to reform and build up their military. 

The calculus changed over time. Russia realised that Ukraine was going to slip out of their grasp if they didn't act soon, and that Ukraine was modernising (though they clearly underestimated the impact). There were now less benefits to wait and let it simmer, and better to just quickly crush Ukraine, spend a few months in a spat with the west, before things began to gradually move on. 

Of course, Ukraine then had the audacity to not roll over and die, and those 8 years since 2014 of Ukraine not being on total war meant that they had had time to develop their defence to the point that they could check the Russia advance and gain long term western support.

It's why war is almost never declared in modern times. Vietnam war? Not a war officially. Congress authorized sending troops but never declared war.

Civil wars are rarely called wars because it recognizes the other side as a state, which feeds their legitimacy. The British never considered the war for Irish independence as a war for this reason.

The long short of it is that declaring war is a formality that's inconvenient and brings no benefits, especially in the modern international framework.

 >On the morning of 7 April 2017, the United States launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea into Syria, aimed at Shayrat Airbase controlled by the Syrian government. The strike was executed under responsibility of U.S. President Donald Trump, as a direct response to the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack that occurred on 4 April. The strike was the first unilateral military action by the United States targeting the Syrian government during the Syrian Civil War. President Trump stated shortly thereafter, ""It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons"".

I had two threads on it in the recap and even then it basically boiled down to not-so-good at protecting big cities, is good at protecting single targets.  Plus the systems really do require a lot of training.  The US has been planning to supply 8 NASAMS for 3-4 months now and started training as soon as they were announced and building the systems too.  They will be delivered (with certified operators) by the end of the year.   

Germany is also providing 4 IRIS-T systems and they also had to be built from scratch.  Not even Germany has these systems.

So its complicated, especially when there are so many targets in the air.  The sad thing is, even with the 8 NASAMS and 4 IRIS-T fully installed and working, missile swarms like Monday are still going to get a few missiles through to hit their targets :(

Elaborating, they cut production quotas - how much they're *supposed* to aim to produce.

But they were already producing 3.6 million barrels *less* than their quotas overall. Reducing a number that doesn't have a whole lot to do with the **actual** amount of production by 2 million just means (by itself) that they're...lying by less.

There may be a small reduction in oil output, but it's almost certainly going to be far less than that 2 million bpd claim.

But hey, the Japanese devised the concept, so it's fitting that the word used to describe it is in Japanese.

Out of interest, how do you feel about guerilla warfare being conducted by non-hispanic peoples? The word means ""little war"" in Spanish and its etymology is from wars that Spaniards fought against Napoleon. I'd argue that *kamikaze* and *guerilla* are both the correct word to describe a specific military technique, and that there's nothing semantically equivalent to either without using such a loanword.

I mean, ""suicide bombing"" isn't strictly accurate here because nobody is dying, again the concept of a ""suicide drone"" is an oxymoron. Neither is totally accurate, whereas the word *kamikaze* explicitly describes an aircraft used as a weapon itself, which is what is happening here. *Kamikaze* doesn't actually require that the pilot is sacrificed in the attack, indeed some pilots do attempt (or succeed in) bailing out of an aircraft that's on a crash course with the enemy.

I think Ukraine really can get Russia pushed out by the end of the year, with what they have.

But Ukraine does not currently have the capability to stop the Russian strategic/terror bombing campaign. (nor can Russia be forced to return prisoners and abducted civilians, nor can Russia be forced to pay reparations).

The open question is will Russia continue to prosecute this war, even if their forces are pushed-out of Ukrainian territory.  It seems pretty clear that the answer is YES.

The next question is: Is there a level of western air-defense support that will stop the terror-bombing campaign, and restore Ukraine's institutions to some degree of normalcy?  I think the answer to this is probably YES: however, this ""game"" is always a moving target. Russia may start developing and building new missiles that can get around this air defense, and then Ukraine will be forced to develop and build or procure upgrades to their air defense, so there will always be some risk that Russian missiles or bombs will get through.

The final question is whether Russia will force Ukraine to push this conflict to the next level (Ukraine must destroy targets inside Russia, in order to halt their ability to attack Ukraine).  Ukraine does not really have this level of capability, and there's always the fear that this would escalate into nuclear war.

Old Testament God totally would. One example:

>	In 2 Samuel 24, we find that King David decided to take a census of the men of fighting age. The prophet Gad was sent to David to announce God’s displeasure with the taking of the census. The punishment for David’s sin: “The Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from that morning until the appointed time; and seventy thousand of the people died” (2 Samuel 24:15). David makes a decision that does not please God, and God kills 70,000 Israelites for it?

And another:

>	God instructed the Israelites to kill every man, woman, and child among these Canaanites. In Deuteronomy 20:16–18, Moses gives these instructions: “As for the towns of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, you must not let anything that breathes remain alive. You shall annihilate them—the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—just as the Lord your God has commanded.”

>	In Joshua 6:20b–21, you can read about what this looked like as the Israelite army entered the town of Jericho: the Israelites “charged straight ahead into the city and captured it. Then they devoted to destruction by the edge of the sword all in the city, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and donkeys.” After the destruction of Jericho, next would come the people of Ai, then the people of Makkedah and Libnah and Lachish and Eglon and Debir—every man, woman, and child slaughtered and dedicated to God. In the end, the entire population of thirty-one city-states was utterly destroyed.

2019 US aid made up 90% of what ukraine was getting, Trump withholds 400 million at that point? why? not why trump, we know that, why was US aid 90%? because only countries who thought they could defeat russia in a war were willing to give large amounts to ukraine.

2015-2019 average aid 418 million (combining state department and armed force, but excluding humanitarian aid) 

biden administration prior to march 2022 one billion, during march 2020 1 billion (press release 3/16, but that surely went up from there) including 2,000 javelins

trump for his part approved 47 million (210 javelins) and delivered them 4 months later where they were promptly stored as a ""symbolic deterrence"" to russia.

They are also trying to optimize production from their existing fields, more than one of which is in tertiary stage production. They do have more conventional production that can come online though to the best of my knowledge it has not yet.

They are trying to get all the technology in place to be able to handle all their needs so that they are not dependent on other nations for continuing production as countries shift from oil and gas to more sustainable energy sources.

Now they moved the talking points to Rogan.  His audience consists of people that watch Fox but a much larger swatch of his audience doesn't.  So they've moved from base Republicans getting lined up against Ukraine and now they're moving to the next tier of influence.  Let's not forget that when the war started, base Republicans instictively were pro-ukraine.  Only very hardliners and protofascists immediately came out for Russia.  It's taken Republicans this long i guess to feel good about where they've been able to move the base on this.  I'm sure they're doing polling.

This is all prep work for something down the line.  I'm assuming it's to make it palatable to yank all support for Ukraine when they gain Congress back.  My thought is that they will demand that Biden stop sending everything to Ukraine or they're directly harm the country in some manner. Debt ceiling, killing SS, whatever and blame Biden.  

Putin needs them to move quickly, so I don't think we will see them wait quietly for the Presidential, which I think a Republican winning will lead to pulling out of NATO.

He seems to have a tight grip on his security services. Could he not simply claim some sort of victory? 

No because he took the cat out of the bag already. Now he has pissed off a lot of influential people in Russia, even if he still has iron grips on them it's not the status quo it existed before. And it never will be.

Him pulling back without a victory will bring home all these wounds that are festering. The army has been humiliated, the security services are fighting each other (more than the usual for Russia's intelligence apparatus). There is a lot of spilled blood already and he depends on the support of the few yes-men that are looking for blood.

Additionally, there would be a good incentive for someone to actually kick him out post-war. As long as there is Putin regime, there will be tight international sanctions. Kick Putin out, blame him for everything and you may get some ease in sanctions, which makes everyone in Russia happy.

Integrating them into a country's air defense network is tremendously compicated, and the training necessary to operate them so that you can tell the difference between an incoming cruise missile and a friendly jet takes months. (Not to mention the training needed to keep them running.)

>If you want to say we should start the work to get the Ukrainians ready to accept and use Patriot systems, I'd completely agree. But that's not a fix for the current Russian missile barrage, even if you teleported a bunch of Patriot batteries to Ukraine tomorrow.

As I said, there is no earthly reason why the operators couldn't go in with the system immediately or failing that, ex military contractors with experience with the systems.

The idea that a real life american (or german or dutch or greek or south korean or taiwanese) team of operators of a purely defensive static system hundreds of kilometres from the front line = russian freakout and ww3 is another of the logic defying positions that the appeasement crowd have taken early in this conflict and clung to with absolutely no evidence or justification because it avoids doing anything meaningful to help. Shooting down missiles   over ukrainian cities is not a provocative aggressive act. 

Logically the russian government has already told everyone who cares to listen that NATO troops are fighting on the front line. Their domestic propaganda is absolutely rife with this claim. So given they are already saying that and given they have already hugely escalated the war, how could they possibly justify doing anything else in response to NATO troops operating an air defence system hundreds of km behind said front line? What are they supposed to do? Complain to their three friends at the UN that the US is deliberately saving Ukrainian lives?

He invested $6.5m into a start-up electric vehicle company in 2004, when nobody else was doing the same thing because he saw a different future than the rest of the world did. Who cares if he built the car by hand himself.

hint: The difference is: SpaceX boosters can actually attain orbit, and even send payloads into solar orbit (min speed is about 25,000 mph).  Blue Origin can't even put a payload into orbit and can only get a vehicle above the earth's atmosphere (but can't stay there for more than a few minutes).

Nobody wants nuclear war, and NATO is being very careful in how much help they give Ukraine in order to prevent it, but strong countries can not be permitted free reign to swallow smaller countries with impunity simply because they have nukes.

Indeed.

And there will be peace... as soon as Russia GTFO of Ukraine.

Given that Ukraine is pushing Russia back, that Russia is running out of trained soldiers, equipment, and munitions, why should anything less than that be the minimum that Ukraine settles for?

If Russia presented those terms and backed them up by pulling his troops back to the Russian side of the border, then I'm sure that despite Zelenskyy's bluster about never negotiating with Putin, they'd come to the table.

It is the scenario that caused the US to pass the Logan Act out of frustration for the problems Dr. Logan caused. The text of the actual law, however, is more narrow and requires attempts to intentionally affect policy:

>Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

So far, if all Musk has done is hear Putin out, then it is unlikely to be enough to sustain a Logan Act indictment. If he's exchanging information with Putin in order to change how Russia behaves towards the United States so that Russia can better accomplish its foreign policy goals, then it's a deeper problem for Musk.

>At no time did Logan represent himself as the US. 

Not what I mean by ""representing policy promises."" What I mean by that is a statement by Musk to Russia telling their leaders that he is intends to help accomplish X. Whether he says ""I'm doing this with the US government's blessing"" isn't the issue. It's whether he's attempting to get policy changed or telling Putin that he will try to get policy changed.

>In my opinion Musk just did this and then published the Putin position while Putin didn't have to do anything.

The only POSSIBLE thing Musk may have contributed that other financiers would not, is his irrational acceptance of risk. (ie. enduring all the failed tests: (which are absolutely necessary in that business; if you look at the last 100 years of history of rocketry), a lot of other financiers would have backed out.)

Other than that, all he did was sign checks.  
The actual engineers did the engineering.

(I happen to work adjacent to that industry, and I knew a former payload specialist, his office was next-door to mine for 10 years - and most people who spent their lives working on these rockets, were 100% convinced that the SpaceX reusable rockets would never work.  As their enterprise progressed, it was a pretty commonly-held view that SpaceX was going to run out of money.  The guys at Lockheed-Martin and Boeing would have had their plugs pulled very quickly.  So I do credit Musk for supplying the money long after other ""very smart people"" would have dropped the axe.  But I credit the actual engineers who solved this problem; which had actually been worked on by ALL the other companies since the 1990's, and is still being worked on with no real success - except maybe Bezos, but he still cant make orbit.  This is a hellaciously difficult problem. )

I also tend to think that his tenacity and appetite for risk is why Tesla succeeded.  The history of the US auto industry is littered with hundreds of other startups with a ""cool idea"" that got hammered by the big-3. Again: most other financiers would have pulled the plug on Tesla before the first Model S made it to prototype.

Since you insist on this line of thought though, the 1763 proclamation that forbid settlement in the newly acquired territories was not intended as a permanent boundary with the natives. It was supposed to allow for advancement of the frontier in a more “orderly” manner for the purpose of Britain maintaining control over territory and settlers not starting wars with the natives that the army would have to fight. It was never meant to protect the indigenous peoples, just to make it easier for the Crown to maintain taxes and management. Why does that make the British “good?”

The Americans claimed that this was enabling the Native Americans to make war against them in the declaration, which was kind of BS, but they aren’t “good” here either. The American Revolution is not a war that has a lot to do with questions of morality outside of representation. 

The Confederacy on the other hand isn’t considered wrong because they wanted independence (although that too would have resulted in war), they were wrong because they wanted it specifically to maintain slavery. Russia is wrong because they said they wouldn’t attack Ukraine, and then they did, and they are ignoring all “normal” rules for war.

This is naive. People have made this argument, but it's wrong. NATO keeps growing because democracy = prosperity and peace. Not every nation wants to make the bargain, fine. But NATO isn't an empire, and it's not a government either. It's a defense treaty. Russia doesn't and shouldn't have any say in how many countries join NATO, especially when they're treating their neighbors as if the Soviet Union (or the Russian Empire) never left.

NATO isn't ""annexing"" Ukraine any more than it is Sweden and Finland. Russia is the one trying to expand its borders by force. If Russia wants its neighbors to stop trying to join NATO, maybe they could stop threatening them. Which they have literally never stopped doing since the Romanovs were around. Even in the late 90s/early 00s Russian nadir, they were picking on the Chechens.

>  Imagine if they did that to a country/region near the US? 

They *can't.* These kinds of analogies are always doomed to fail, because former Soviet and Warsaw Pact states are coming to NATO and asking for help. Russia can't just bat its eyelashes at Mexico and then Mexico's going to drop 150 years worth of neutrality in exchange for ?????.

There are certain things guaranteed to European citizens through taxes.

This is what being taxed in NL gives me (not an exhaustive list):
  * Unversity education cost me 6000 euro to get.
  * A monthly cap of healthcare cost for me is about 300 euro, everything else would be covered by insurance (this includes dental).
  * Workplaces required by law to provide a minimum of 4 weeks (20 days) paid vacation to employees per year.
  * Welfare cheques if I were to loose my job.
  * Subsidies on medicine, insurance covers all medicinal needs prescribed by a doctor. I've never had to pay for my prescription medicine, which means people never have to choose between a meal and medicine.
  * Government issued medical insurance if you don't earn enough to get private insurance. 
  * Legal cap on insurance cost.
  * Well maintained road public transport systems.

On tax: 
We have Tax brackets here, so I pay 49.50% tax on any income in excess of 69.398 per year. Any income below 69.398 and above 35.572 is taxed 37.07% and anything below that is taxed 9.42%. 

This means if you earn say 100.000€ per year. 
  * First 35.572€ are taxed 09.42%. Which leaves 64428€.
  * Next 33.926€ are taxed 37.07%. Which leaves 30502€.
  * Final 30.502€ is taxed 49.50%.

We add that up and which means from 100.000€ yearly income you pay ~31.024€ in tax per year.

This is the tax system that enables the standard of living most western European countries have. So no it isn't free, and yes it has a higher up front cost per year if you don't get sick, but if shit goes sideways you won't go bankrupt.

Edit: I got the tax rates a bit wrong but the gist the system should be clear.

Correction, tax bracket rates as of 2022 are:

Oh Mr. ""I understand war"", please enlighten me how this means that Russia is winning. Saudi-Arabia is nothing in comparison to the west. What could they give Russia that would really help them? Russia doesn't need oil, they need advanced technology to keep producing their military machinery and rockets (so they don't have to buy from North Korea and Iran). 
How exactly does bombing civilians help the Russian war effort? Spoiler: it doesn't, it just depletes their already low running stockpiles.
And how exactly is Russia escalating? They have drawn so many red lines (first ""no Western involvement"", then ""no heavy weapons"", then ""no long range HIMARS"", then ""no attack on Russian territory"", then ""no attack on Kerch bridge"") and Ukraine and the west crossed all of them? Putin is as impotent as his own military and cannot enforce any of the ""red lines"" they have drawn.
At the same time, Ukraine is kicking their asses in the area that really counts: the battlefield. Russian troops are fleeing faster than Ukraine can advance, the fronts are collapsing, men are fleeing Russia, and rusty old Soviet equipment is distributed.
Russia's shelling of civilians does nothing but galvanize western support. It's nothing but the temper tantrum of a bully that finally found someone to stand up to them.
