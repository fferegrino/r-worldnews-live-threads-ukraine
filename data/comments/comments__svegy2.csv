I figure I‚Äôd chime in with a few indicators because I‚Äôm seeing a ton of people on flight radar.

You‚Äôre going to be looking for a mass influx of IL-76s to a few select locations. So far I haven‚Äôt heard much about VDV amassing at airfields yet, but I‚Äôd expect to see it occur around the time the aerial campaign begins. You also probably won‚Äôt see their shit rigged for a drop on Twitter/TikTok. It can happen in hours in garrison. Ivanovo, Pskov, Tula, Ryazan, Kostroma is where you‚Äôd likely see them come from.

VKS will likely go dark before shit gets real.

You won‚Äôt be seeing Russia establish air superiority in real time with flight radar- UKR would be a complete no-fly zone for all commercial air and VKS transponders would be off. EW equipment would also be active.

Edit: just saw Estonian intelligence say 1 Russian VDV Division is deployed. Pretty sure they have 5 divisions and 3 or 4 further separate brigades they can call on. That‚Äôs off the top of my head- but those are the shock troops you‚Äôd expect to be air dropped in.

106th GAD preparing for an airdrop and moving the vehicles at night isn‚Äôt a good sign. I‚Äôd expect other airborne divisions are doing the same, even if we don‚Äôt see it.

ad12327ba3c48fdab8ae6aac4edbde93,svegy2,hxhkuh7,"From The Institute for The Study of War, today. 

Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine on Saturday, February 19, 2022. 

The attack would likely begin with an air and missile campaign targeting much of Ukraine to decapitate the government and degrade the Ukrainian military as well as the ability of Ukrainian citizens to prepare to resist a subsequent Russian invasion. US and allied governments have been warning of such an attack for some days, pointing to the size of the Russian forces concentrated on Ukraine‚Äôs borders.

[1]¬†Western officials have additionally said that Russian troops have moved to jumping-off positions for an invasion over the past 24 hours. 

The following additional conditions and indicators point to February 19 as an optimal date for a Russian attack:

1. Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelensky will be in Germany at the Munich Security Conference. He is scheduled to speak at 1530 Munich time.[2]¬†

His absence from Ukraine will degrade his ability to coordinate a response to any Russian attack and create more propitious circumstances for a Russian-sponsored attempt at a coup d‚Äôetat.¬†

Russian forces could close Ukrainian airspace to prevent Zelensky from returning to Kyiv.

2. Russian President Vladimir Putin will reportedly oversee Russian nuclear drills on Saturday, February 19, as well.[3]Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko will accompany Putin.

Those drills are being conducted out of the usual exercise cycle and are clearly intended to deter any Western response to an attack.

Putin and Lukashenko will observe the exercises from an unspecified ‚Äúsituational center‚Äù in Moscow, likely the Russian Ministry of Defense‚Äôs National Defense Control Center (NDCC). That would put them in the best position to oversee conventional military operations as well.

Launching the attack during those drills would take maximal advantage of their deterrent effect.

3. Russian proxy provocations in eastern Ukraine have increased dramatically since February 16, including an artillery barrage that damaged a kindergarten in unoccupied Ukraine and multiple other proxy attacks.[4]¬†

Russian proxies have increased the frequency and drama of their claims of Ukrainian attacks on them as well as their false claims that Ukraine is preparing to invade occupied Donbas.

Russia‚Äôs proxies in Donbas began evacuating civilians to Russia ahead of a claimed Ukrainian offensive.[5]¬†

Russian senior officials, including Putin, have been increasingly repeating and expanding on those claims this week.[6]¬†

4. The proxy campaign is likely intended on the one hand to draw Ukrainian forces into a response that Russia would then claim to be an attack and, on the other, to use false flag attacks and outright disinformation to fabricate justifications for a Russian attack to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù ‚ÄúRussian citizens‚Äù in occupied Donbas. This rhetorical and kinetic activity has crossed thresholds pointing to the likelihood of an actual Russian attack.

This update reflects a change to our assessments and forecasts. We have previously assessed that Putin was setting conditions to move Russian forces overtly into occupied Donbas and possibly conduct a limited invasion in unoccupied southeastern Ukraine and/or an air/missile campaign. We now assess that those Russian activities are extremely likely and imminent and that a much larger-scale Russian invasion is very possible",False,1645214241.0,t3_svegy2,t3_svegy2,,0,35,0,35,0,0,

Ukraine wants to join NATO. They are also a fledgling democracy with aspirations of joining the EU. Ukraine would be a key ally and a great economic partner to NATO and the EU. Democracy is also fragile and should be respected and protected, something that Putin would like to destroy. 

Basically, the West has a lot to gain in a friend, ally and trading partner with Ukraine, and Ukraine has even more to gain by allying itself with the west, specifically it stands to gain greater economic stability, access to better markets, and a LOT more protection from Russian aggression. Additionally, Ukraine WANTS to join NATO. If NATO and the US allowed Russia to determine who does and does not get to join NATO or the EU, then these alliances begin to lose credibility and power. Fuck Putin

Edit: I heard a foreign policy expert say that from the perspective of the United States, ‚Äúa Ukraine that is willing to defend itself is worth defending.‚Äù Despite what Russian trolls would like you to believe, the United States and NATO see it in their best interest to ally themselves with other democracies that are willing to stand together and fight for the right of self determination and human rights.

Second, and I'm going off the assumption there is going to be an invasion, but limited NATO involvement. All the news I get is around the U.S. thoughts and preparations. What are the feelings from the other NATO nations?

I figure I‚Äôd chime in with a few indicators because I‚Äôm seeing a ton of people on flight radar.

You‚Äôre going to be looking for a mass influx of IL-76s to a few select locations. So far I haven‚Äôt heard much about VDV amassing at airfields yet, but I‚Äôd expect to see it occur around the time the aerial campaign begins. You also probably won‚Äôt see their shit rigged for a drop on Twitter/TikTok. It can happen in hours in garrison. Ivanovo, Pskov, Tula, Ryazan, Kostroma is where you‚Äôd likely see them come from.

VKS will likely go dark before shit gets real.

You won‚Äôt be seeing Russia establish air superiority in real time with flight radar- UKR would be a complete no-fly zone for all commercial air and VKS transponders would be off. EW equipment would also be active.

Edit: just saw Estonian intelligence say 1 Russian VDV Division is deployed. Pretty sure they have 5 divisions and 3 or 4 further separate brigades they can call on. That‚Äôs off the top of my head- but those are the shock troops you‚Äôd expect to be air dropped in.

7 hours ago a video was posted showing VDV IFVs rigged for an airdrop at one of the cities I called out in my previous post: Tula

https://mobile.twitter.com/pmakela1/status/1494552690717872133

106th GAD preparing for an airdrop and moving the vehicles at night isn‚Äôt a good sign. I‚Äôd expect other airborne divisions are doing the same, even if we don‚Äôt see it.

‚ÄúThere were photos of BMD-2 airborne armored vehicles from the VDV's 51st Airborne Regiment in Tula rigged with parachutes. If we include those VDV battalions that could take part in an airborne operation, we may need to add 3 or more BTGs to the figure.‚Äù

Putting aside that I've grown attached to watching this fledgling democracy grow out of the smoldering ruins of the USSR to becoming a developing democracy for a group of people who have long been under foreign powers yet retained a unique culture, language, and identity, this is also going to have huge ramifications in a world now absorbed in social media.

Within the past decade, we've gotten glimpses of this with Syria, Hong Kong, and the various civil conflicts that have erupted in the face of social media. But Ukraine is not only a rather developed and westernizing nation with a strong connection to the global audience, but they have a much larger population involved, over 40 million, who all have connections to the outside. Even if people wanted to avert their eyes, I think it's going to be impossible to avoid this on the internet.

Baltic States (1940 - gave up without fighting)

Romania (1940 - gave up Bessarabia without fighting)

Moldova (1992 - gave up after some fighting)

Georgia (2008 - gave up very quickly once Russia went in)

Ukraine (2x in 2014 - gave up Crimea without a fight, gave up twice in Donbass after Russia invaded and started creating/eliminating pockets of Ukrainain forces).

The missile systems (–ò—Å–∫–∞–Ω–¥–µ—Ä-–ú) are to replace the obsolete OTR-21 Tochka systems, still in use by the Russian armed forces, by 2020. The Iskander has several different conventional warheads, including a cluster munitions warhead, a fuel-air explosive enhanced-blast warhead, a high explosive-fragmentation warhead, an earth penetrator for bunker busting and an electromagnetic pulse device for anti-radar missions. The missile can also carry nuclear warheads.

NATO looks 1000x more appealing than Russia on the world stage--the world sees NATO throwing its support behind Ukraine even though they are not a member, and they see Russia attacking its neighbors when and if they feel like it. Furthermore, Ukraine is now more heavily armed than they have been at any point since the first and still ongoing invasion in 2014.

I know the US has encouraged other NATO members to increase the percent of their GDPs they spend on defense (the former guy did it by being a total asshole but on some level, European members of NATO *do* need to contribute more), and this whole scenario will nudge Europe to increase their defense spending dramatically I think.  Russia's campaign in Ukraine has made the threat that Russia poses to Europe as a whole more real than at any time after the cold war. 

Russia's actions haven't resulted in greater complacency on the part of NATO, but have emphasized why the alliance is still extremely important to the security and economy of Europe.",False,1645207451.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxh0sv8,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Putin is an autocrat, but autocrats never lead alone.

Stealing the wealth from one set of elites (those in Ukraine that defied the Kremlin), and giving control to those loyal to Moscow.

My two cents as an amateur but deeply involved observer.

Putin‚Äôs one goal is to end the Zelensky government. He will do this by any means necessary. This may be the start of WW3. However, I think an under hyped possible reality is that Putin invades but Ukraine straight up defends and wins the war outright.

If you are a peaceful, independent person then send your good vibes to the Ukrainians. They have the largest army in Europe and will be the people who has the first chance to win ‚ÄòWW3‚Äô and they could simply take matters into their own hands with a resolute defense.

I can‚Äôt prove to you in any way that I know what I‚Äôm talking about but I‚Äôll point out that a few days back I [mentioned a Russian push to the Dnieper to seize right back Ukraine](https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ssryw0/_/hx04z01/?context=1), a hypothesis that has now been released by the British Ministry of Defense. You can take what I‚Äôm telling you here with whatever degree of credibility you want, I‚Äôm just a stranger on the internet.

Russia‚Äôs plan is to blitz Ukraine in a 48-72 hour offensive that decapitates the Ukrainian government and traps the Ukrainian military; you can see from their troop positions that they intend to come in from the north, south, and east simultaneously, which will trap Ukrainian forces east of the Dnieper. The Dnieper provides a natural border that‚Äôs relatively easily defended and once the troops in the east are cut off they can either be forced to surrender as they run out of supplies or straight up annihilated piecemeal while a relatively small force holds the line on the Dnieper against a Ukrainian counterattack (which is unlikely anyway). They‚Äôre not allocating enough troops to seize major urban areas against stiff resistance which means they expect Kharkiv to fall without much of a fight and possibly Kiev as well (although I doubt they necessarily try to take all of Kiev, might just take the right bank for the time being, consolidate their hold, and basically have a dagger pointed at the heart of the remainder of the city). They‚Äôd have tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers as POWs and the populations of entire Ukrainian cities as negotiating chips to get whatever else they wanted. This is a very complex and ambitious plan that relies on Ukrainian resistance melting away.

But blitzkrieg is very risky too. You have to lead with your best units and everything has to go VERY smoothly or the whole thing goes sideways. They haven‚Äôt allocated an overwhelming force, they‚Äôre relying on their troops being better led, more motivated, and better equipped to make up the difference in manpower (you‚Äôd normally want a 3:1 ratio of attackers to defenders and they aren‚Äôt even close to that). Now they know from experience that they don‚Äôt NEED a 3:1 ratio because the Nazis made it to Moscow on a 1.25:1 or lower ratio, so it‚Äôs POSSIBLE. Whether or not it‚Äôs LIKELY here is debatable.

And that‚Äôs where the great risk arises. This plan is very popular in Russia with a huge caveat: it must be relatively bloodless. The expectation among the Russian people is that it will be short and casualties will be light, Desert Storm and not Chechnya. The conditions on the ground make that assumption tenuous at best. The Ukrainians seem genuinely willing to fight and they‚Äôve been equipped with the tools to make it very costly, particularly the Javelin missiles and similar devices. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how easy these types of missiles are to use: they require a 3 second lock and then they automatically track and kill the target. The solution is to screen your armored vehicles with air cover like helicopters, which is why Ukraine was given man portable air defense weapons as well - updated Stinger missiles like the Afghans used to shoot down helicopters in the 1980s. Each vehicle destroyed kills several soldiers (their tanks have a crew of 3 and their armored personnel carriers have a 3 man crew plus 8 soldiers for a total of 11, their attack helicopters have a crew of 2-3 and room for 8 troops as well). Each missile hit will cause multiple casualties and Ukraine now has thousands of these weapons, maybe ten thousand anti tank missiles. The casualties could be very high.

And this is where the greatest risk comes in. Back in June 2020, Russia updated their strategic nuclear doctrine to make clear that they would use nuclear weapons in a regional conflict if a conventional attack posed an existential threat to the state. They‚Äôve made statements to suggest that an existential threat doesn‚Äôt mean NATO troops in Moscow or something but could be triggered by the destruction of a substantial portion of of the Russian Army such that the security of the state would be compromised. Currently, something like 40% of their active military is poised to invade Ukraine so if it turns into a bloodbath (and for the reasons I outlined above it very well might if anyone miscalculated at all) then they might ‚Äúescalate to de-escalate‚Äù which would involve the threat or actual use of tactical nuclear weapons.

Basically this is a VERY dangerous game that will get MUCH more dangerous if you see Russia start to take heavy casualties or fail to take critical objectives quickly. It‚Äôs almost better for the rest of the world if Ukraine collapses immediately but they don‚Äôt seem inclined to do so (rightfully so) and the West has given them the tools to mount an effective resistance if they have the will to use them (which made sense if they deterred an invasion in the first place but could really backfire in the long run if they‚Äôre used effectively to annihilate large portions of the Russian Army). That‚Äôs the problem with playing these stupid games that Putin seems to love so much - eventually you end up winning a stupid prize.",1645211121.0,1645210909.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxh4dkh,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

To elaborate, the weapons and resources that the United States stations in NATO countries aren't just under the command of the United States. Granted, they won't do anything unless the U.S. government gives the go ahead, but they are also under the command of NATO joint command. This means that the U.S. can't just launch an attack from these countries without their permission. Doing so would be ruinous to diplomatic relations with these eastern European countries.

So how are we supposed to picture these forces in Eastern Europe? The answer is that they are acting as supplemental forces serving at the pleasure of the host country. Ultimately the United States is limited in what it can do with its assets in those countries by the wishes of the host country. When viewed through this lens it's pretty obvious that the reason why Putin doesn't like the United States in Eastern Europe isn't because the U.S. is going to launch a surprise attack on Moscow. Rather, it's because it means that countries that are supposed to be irrelevant and subservient to Moscow (Poland, Lithuania, Estonia etc.) can instead go toe-to-toe with Moscow and gives them and equal seat at the table.

But the US and Europe never made hostile moves toward Russia. Strengthening their defense against Russian expansion didn't lead to any shootouts. The US didn't sneak its borders into Russian territory like Russia has been doing against its neighbors.

What really got Putin fired up was the combination of protests in Ukraine, the loss of his proxy ruler in Ukraine, protests in Moscow, and Putin's worse than anticipated showing in Russian elections around the same time. He isn't genuinely afraid that NATO is about to trigger a nuclear war by invading. He is afraid that all his work to harden his own authority will be undone when Ukraine becomes prosperous and self-determining like South Korea to Putin's North Korea. He is afraid that he will never be able to realize his dream of standing alone against the rest of the world if he lets Ukraine go.

Putin invaded or propped up nearly all of his weaker neighbors at some point. He didn't need NATO on his southern border to go into Kazakhstan. His apologists blaming the US for putting too much pressure are conveniently overlooking the fact that Putin would have been much more overbearing toward his neighbors earlier on without NATO and democratic Ukraine in his way.

That being said, regardless of whether it was smart or stupid for Germany to rely on Russian gas/oil, it is a fact that they rely on it for the vast majority of their energy needs. It is HUGELY consequential that Germany could see oil prices double or triple, or perhaps even see some plants shut down for lack of fuel. They are not wrong to be panicking.

My hope is that they are furiously trying to negotiate with the US and Saudi Arabia to ensure supply isn't interrupted when and if Putin decides to cut exports to Europe. They would be utterly insane not to have contingencies in place for this scenario. 

I suppose they have to keep Russia happy enough that they don't fuck with the pipeline until they can get these contingencies ironed out, but also try to show some support for NATO/Europe.

 >The Little Russia Office (Russian: –ü—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑ –ú–∞–ª—ã—è –†–æ—Å—Å—ñ–∏) was a Muscovite state agency (Prikaz) and  administrative body of the Tsardom of Muscovy in charge of affairs connected with the Cossack Hetmanate and the Left-bank Ukraine. Created on 10 January 1663 [O.S. 31 December 1662], the office existed until 1722 when it was transformed into the Collegium of Little Russia and moved to Hlukhiv. The Little Russia Office was part of the bigger Ambassadorial Office and since 1671 was chaired by the head of the office. Located in Moscow, since 1707 the agency had its resident general in the hetman's capital.
 
**[Holodomor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor)** 
 
 >The Holodomor (Ukrainian: –ì–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º–æÃÅ—Ä, romanized: Holodomor, IPA: […¶olodoÀàm…îr]; derived from –º–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–∏ –≥–æ–ª–æ–¥–æ–º, moryty holodom, 'to kill by starvation'), also known as the Terror-Famine or the Great Famine, was a famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It was a large part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932‚Äì1933. The term Holodomor emphasises the famine's man-made and allegedly intentional aspects such as rejection of outside aid, confiscation of all household foodstuffs and restriction of population movement.

""Finnish concessions and territorial losses exceeded those demanded by the Soviets before the war. Finland was forced to cede approximately half of Finnish Karelia (with Finland's industrial centre, including Vyborg/Viipuri (Finland's fourth-largest city) and K√§kisalmi; Sortavala and Suoj√§rvi and the whole of Viipuri Bay, with its islands; in total, approximately 9% of its territory) even though large parts were still held by the Finnish army. Military troops and remaining civilians were hastily evacuated to inside the new border; 422,000 Karelians, 12% of Finland's population, lost their homes.

There was also an area that the Russians captured during the war that remained in Finnish hands according to the treaty: Petsamo. The treaty also stipulated that Finland would grant free passage for Soviet civilians through Petsamo to Norway.  
  
Finland also had to cede a part of the Salla area, the Finnish part of the Kalastajansaarento (Rybachi) Peninsula in the Barents Sea, and in the Gulf of Finland the islands of Suursaari, Tyt√§rsaari, Lavansaari (now Moshchny Island –æ. –ú–æ—â–Ω—ã–π), Peninsaari (now Maly Island, –æ. –ú–∞–ª—ã–π) and Seiskari. Finally, the Hanko Peninsula was leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base for 30 years at an annual rent of 8 million marks.

Additional demands were the handing over any equipment and installations on the territories that were ceded. Thus Finland had to hand over 75 locomotives, 2,000 railroad cars, and a number of cars, trucks and ships. The Enso industrial area, which was clearly on the Finnish side of the border, as it was drawn in the peace treaty, was also soon added to the Finnish losses of territory and equipment.""",False,1645194294.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxg4e18,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

‚≠êÔ∏èüïô‚≠êÔ∏èUrgent statement of the official representative of the NM DPR

 ‚ÄºÔ∏èBurning Message!
 üîªIn the Gorlovsky direction, the servicemen of the NM DPR prevented an attempt by an enemy sabotage group to penetrate the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic.
 ‚ùóÔ∏èAlong the forest belt near the settlement  ZELEZNAYA BEAM our observers revealed the movement of two special-purpose groups of VFU in the amount of 10 and 12 people.  Our defenders were forced to open fire from on-duty weapons.  The enemy suffered losses of at least TWO militants killed, THREE wounded and was forced to retreat.
 ‚ö†Ô∏èAccording to our intelligence, saboteurs planned to blow up a container with chlorine on the territory of a sewage treatment plant near the city of Gorlovka.
 üîªAt the scene of the clash, foreign-made personal protective equipment and ammunition, as well as an action camera mounted on a bulletproof vest, were found.  Apparently, with the help of it, the militants planned to provide their leadership with confirmation of the completion of the task.
 ‚ô¶Ô∏èAs evidence of the criminal intentions of the Ukrainian side, we present the footage from this camera to your attention.
 ‚ô¶Ô∏èShortly before the clash, we intercepted the conversations of saboteurs in Polish.  We have previously reported on the participation of Polish mercenaries on the side of Ukrainian militants.
 ‚ùóÔ∏èIn addition, according to information received from the Ministry of State Security of the DPR today, at about 4.00 am in the city of Gorlovka, a group of Ukrainian saboteurs attempted to blow up the ammonia storage tank at the Stirol plant.  During the attack, a security guard of the enterprise, who discovered a group of saboteurs, was wounded.  He received medical assistance, there is no threat to life.
 üîπ Special services are working at the scene.
 ‚ô¶Ô∏èWe appeal to the world community and representatives of international organizations, we ask you to give a critical assessment of the criminal actions of the Ukrainian side.
 ‚ô¶Ô∏èThe armed formations of Ukraine are purposefully trying to sow fear and panic among the civilian population of the Republic and for this purpose they choose vital civilian objects for strikes.
 ‚ùóÔ∏èOnly in the morning, the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out attacks on the oil depot in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement.  ELENOVKA, to the sewage treatment plant and the Stirol plant in Gorlovka, and also put out of action TWO transformer substations.
 ‚ÄºÔ∏èThe above facts are direct confirmation of the preparation of the Ukrainian side to unleash hostilities.",False,1645186636.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxfr2sx,,2,-1,0,-1,0,0,

Russian shipbuilding (except their Navy lmaoooo) and in particular their stabilisation systems, are world class they require substantially less electricity to run and are significantly easier to maintain (ie: you CAN maintain it without an electrical engineering degree) than something from say, a Finnish or Dutch boat builder. They beat you guys to space (and by extension, ICBM's), they built the first 'space station', they've had numerous jet fighters leapfrog US homegrown capabilities (especially in maneuverability) multiple times over the decades (manned air superiority and air - air dogfighting seems to be on the downtrend anyways, but the US is the king right now with the F-35, but NOT for it's maneuverability) and have successfully detonated the largest bomb to ever exist.

As of recently, atleast with the way US DoD and the media is reporting it, they've got you on hypersonic missile tech, and their cyber-warfare is much better established. Underestimating your enemy is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. They could cripple any country the flick of a switch and the execution of a computer program. They have almost single handedly shifted the landscape and concept of war over the new millenium.

I personally believe the usual metrics (army size, GPD, import v export %'s, etc)  to measure a countries strength are outdated and just could not be applied to Russia to begin with. 

How do you get an accurate estimate of Russia's army size in the modern day? Is it just the armed forces on the border? What about the off the books but definitely on someone's books mercenaries? Dark ops? Cyber-warfare?

How do you get an estimate of Russia's GPD when so much of their economy is corrupted and funneled off the books? What about their absolutely enormous (the biggest, and still growing) gold reserves? Their network of dark solid/liquid assets across the globe?

I'm scared of what they could be become in the future.. they're one of a few countries that stand to BENEFIT from climate change, they've proactively setup a country wide backup intranet, they are extremely energy independent with a very large homegrown manufacturing and materials sector, fantastic geographical location and size, with an enormous compliant population to boot.",1645225119.0,1645224207.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxhylfi,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. Then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.

 >The Donbas or Donbass (UK: , US: ; Ukrainian: –î–æ–Ω–±–∞ÃÅ—Å [donÀàb…ës]; Russian: –î–æ–Ω–±–∞ÃÅ—Å—Å) is a historical, cultural, and economic region in south-eastern Ukraine, some of whose territory is occupied by two unrecognized separatist states, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic. The word Donbas is a portmanteau formed from Donets Basin, an abbreviation of ""Donets Coal Basin"" (Ukrainian: –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü—å–∫–∏–π –≤—É–≥—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –±–∞—Å–µ–π–Ω, romanized: Donetskyi vuhilnyi basein; Russian: –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π —É–≥–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –±–∞—Å—Å–µ–π–Ω, romanized: Donetskii ugolnyi bassein). The name of the coal basin is a reference to the Donets Ridge; the latter is associated with the river Donets.

Its key for Russia that Ukraine doesnt join the NATO/EU for which those republics are so instrument.

 >The Winter War, also known as First Soviet-Finnish War, was a war between the Soviet Union (USSR) and Finland. It began with a Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939, three months after the outbreak of World War II, and ended three and a half months later with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940. Despite superior military strength, especially in tanks and aircraft, the Soviet Union suffered severe losses and initially made little headway. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union from the organisation.

I agree. What I disagree with is that people here actually care, as indicated by basically doing nothing but talk about it on reddit.

I have a hard time saying ""I care about this"" when I'm doing nothing about it.  


It's not that I have a disregard for human life. I'm simply pointing out that this is only news because of the % of probability it has to be devastating to people personally. Though minor, it's cold-war risk. Though minor, it's nuclear war risk. Though minor, it's WW3 risk. 

That risk is extremely minor - but the only reason it's in the news cycle is **not** because of innocent civilian lives. The lives realistically lost here will pale in comparison compared with the world's problems. 

I think the only reason people care is because of that tail risk % of extreme consequences is higher than usual. It has a minute % to start something huge - **and that's what people care about**.

Stop right there. No, no they could not have. Anything within like 20~30km of the shore was fair game for the battleships to bombard, and anything they missed would have been hit by bombers. There was no ""digging in"" under those conditions. 

There's this common misconception that the Normandy landings were some sort of grueling, barely accomplished ordeal, but in reality that was only at Omaha, where weather prevented Allied naval and air support from having the desired effect - the rest of the beaches required little to no effort to capture because bombers and battleships had vaporized everything within 30km of the landing zone. I think Utah didn't even break 200 casualties, for example. Trying to dig in close enough to cover the beach would have just resulted in the Allies bombing it all, which would be a staggering loss of men and materiel for no gain.

Kosovo was an autonomous province until 1974, when it became de facto independent if not de jure, with a central bank, rights to legislate, its own courts, police, education, health care, cultural institutions etc, protected in the constitution. These were illegally overwritten in 1990, Kosovo had its first referendum on independence with 99% in favour which was overruled. There was a conflict which was so severe the first ad hoc court since the end of WW2 was established, solely to determine genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. 

Crimea was on paper an independent region until the 50s when in 15 minutes Khrushchev made it an oblast of the Ukrainian SSR. There were no legal challenges, protests, or referendum - Crimea accepted it because it was only independent on paper, not in reality. 

It had some special economic rights from the 1990s, but it never had its own central bank, policing, courts, healthcare, or legislative rights, like Kosovo had for decades. 

Independence had never been a major topic in Crimea. None of the major Crimean political parties, even United Russia, supported independence until 2014. 

Crimea certainly had some political tribulation from the protests happening 600km away, but it's offensive to say its on par with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. 

Also, importantly, Kosovo's self determination was for independence. Crimea's self determination was for becoming part of another territory. These are very different principles.

The Germans were dug in and still capable of resisting the allied invasion with great ferocity, despite their small numbers and limited armaments.

Also, the types of bombs that the allies were using during that era were not ""vaporizing"" anything. They were ineffective against deep, reinforced concrete bunkers and only effective against lighter surface bunkers if they happened to land right on target, which was rare. They weren't anything like today's modern weapons, which can accurately identify deep fortifications and penetrate them prior to exploding or utilize advanced fuel-air explosions. They primarily relied on surface concussions and incendiaries.

The Germans weren't idiots. Digging-in to resist an invasion wouldn't be sending a bunch of infantrymen to dig trenches in the sand. It would include mining water and the beaches and establishing a layered defense going back at least 50  kilometers, sending fresh troops to the forward fortifications under the cover of artillery fire against the beach and ocean and rotating them with rear guard to resist any airborne insertions from behind their lines.

Yes, it does have a choice. NATO is a defensive alliance. That means it's only a threat if you invade a NATO member. It wasn't that long ago that Russia participated in joint exercises with NATO. Clearly, the perceived ""threat"" they pose to Russia is manufactured. Either that or it's problematic for some future visions of conquest that Russia has.

Russia is scared of Ukraine becoming a functioning democracy, which poses a threat to the autocracy that Russia is currently operating under. Corruption in Ukraine is no secret, but they've made some significant progress in rooting it out at the highest level. Putin looks at civilian movements like those as threats to his own power, not because of some military threat, but because they serve as examples of the type of power people hold over their government.

d9f8e6a757b9f39217c8ab0c53065385,svegy2,hxi71p4,"Well let's breakdown your 6000 number.  Russia's total stockpile is approx 6,257 warheads.  So you are on the money there.

Of those 1,760 are non-operational and awaiting dis-assembly.  

4,497 are assigned to be potentially deployed on military vehicles, however, ""only"" 1,458 of them are actually officially marked as actively deployed.  (The rest are stored and would take time to equip and arm for delivery, days to weeks at a minimum, too long to be relevant in an all out exchange that wasn't pre-meditated).

So now let's break the 1,458 number down further, since that's what we assume are actively in service (the US count is 1,389 for the record so similar numbers, proving these aren't entirely out of someone's ass, and similarly they have 3,750 in the assigned for potential deployment bucket, again close enough that in an all out exchange it doesn't matter).

A portion of those are assigned to the air wing.  Russia doesn't have bombers capable of realistically delivering those warheads to targets without being shot down.  A further portion is assigned to their sub fleet, where both the fleet and the delivery systems are in questionable condition.  Let's say the first two legs of the triad account for just 50% of the warheads.  That takes us down to 800 warheads give or take in ICBM launched scenarios.  

800 warheads is a far cry from the 6,000 number, which sure, it sounds scary and 800 warheads can still do a lot of damage, but there are weapons designed to deal with those.  Additionally the SLBM from the submarines that may work and fire have their own counter-measures.  

So a reasonable estimate might be 100-200 warheads get through.  Still untold amounts of death and destruction, but not enough to be a kill shot, end of the world type of scenario.

Compare this to the US forces, which has a similar number of active warheads.  Their bomber fleet has stealth technology, backed by better missiles and radar and support craft (radar is debatable I suppose if I want to be fair in this analysis, maybe a draw is more fair).  Much higher likelihood of delivering their ordinance. 

The US sub fleet is in MUCH better shape than Russia's and is likely to deliver the vast majority of their payload to target.  

The ICBM fleets are likely similar, although no one really knows the state of Russia's ICBM fleet across the board.

The west has multiple rings of intercept capability that aren't present in Russia precisely due to NATO and geography.  Russia's ability to intercept inbound warheads, while perhaps technically on par doesn't match the breadth and depth of NATO deployments in this regard.  So let's assume that roughly half of the US warheads make it through.. that's 600+ warheads hitting targets, which IS definitely a kill shot.

In this quick and dirty break down I have omitted the 500+ warheads of the UK and France, which are all at a very high state of readiness and are able to effectively be put on targets.  

You are welcome to Google for yourself the state of the various nation's weapon systems, delivery system information, estimated states of combat readiness, etc.  I'm not here to break all of that down for you (nor would you accept it if I simply did, so I will let you ""do your own research""), but I think you will find upon such research you will find most of the reasoning above is reasonably sound and based in best known information.

Caveat as always; either side may have some delivery system or other technology that isn't known about to skew these numbers in either direction, but that is dealing in a totally different realm and won't 'win' this debate for either of our positions.",False,1645223120.0,t3_svegy2,t1_hxi1z5s,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

 >An anti-ballistic missile (ABM) is a surface-to-air missile designed to counter ballistic missiles (missile defense). Ballistic missiles are used to deliver nuclear, chemical, biological, or conventional warheads in a ballistic flight trajectory. The term ""anti-ballistic missile"" is a generic term conveying a system designed to intercept and destroy any type of ballistic threat; however, it is commonly used for systems specifically designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

In my brain, I'm a realist in my understanding of foreign relations. Russia is acting in its own interest to expand its sphere of influence to defend its security which NATO expansion is undermining. Security needs to be reciprocal, it's when things get out of balance that wars break out. And I agree with you that war is inherently unjust (unless war is thrust upon you).

But I'm a liberal democrat in my heart. I see a frightening realignment of the world towards more right-wing authoritarianism (imo a Republican-led US is just as dangerous to world peace as Putin).
