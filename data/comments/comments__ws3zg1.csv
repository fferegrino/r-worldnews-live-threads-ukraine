Day 177 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we were shelled one time at around 10pm, but we don’t know what was hit yet. Yesterday the missile strike was extremely late, at 5:50am. We even thought there would be no missiles, but they came anyway. There were at least 5 missiles that hit the city, and they destroyed a company that produced hygiene products, a college, where they killed a guard that was inside, and then some of the missiles fell in the middle of a random street.

They also did a missile strike today, at 1am, but it was pretty different from their usual ones, you could say it was *“special”*. People don’t know how many missiles were launched exactly, but it was between 8 and 12. The first special characteristic that it had was that 4 missiles malfunctioned and blew up in the air right after being launched. It was also caught on video, so we have proof of that. That means that up to 50% of their missiles were faulty today, this is just insane. 

Then another special thing about those missiles was that instead of the usual 1-2 minutes travel time from Belgorod to Kharkiv, those missiles flew for over 5 minutes to get here. What the hell were those missiles? Don’t tell me they’ve actually ran out of their usual S-300 missiles, and now they found something even older? That would be completely laughable.

What is also just very funny to me is that regular Russians always brag about their hypersonic missiles Kinzhal and Zircon, and how they are *definitely* the weapon that will make them victorious. The good thing about those missiles is just that they are very fast; their warhead is the same 500kg of explosives. But the thing is, we can barely intercept their usual Iskanders as is, and they have the same exact warhead, they are just slower. So how exactly, a missile, that in our eyes, is the exact same thing as the far cheaper Iskander, going to help them in any way?

As I’m writing this, at 4am, they’ve just launched their missiles a second time. A double missile strike in a single day is very rare for them. As far as I can tell they are the same really slow 5+ minutes travel time missiles that fail a lot. Are they mad about the fact that those missiles are garbage, so they are substituting quality of their missiles with their quantity?

IAEA visit to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant might happen in early September, Russian official says 

From CNN's Uliana Pavlova and Tim Lister


A delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency may be able to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in early September, according to Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian representative in Vienna where the IAEA is based.

Ulyanov said during an online briefing on Friday: “It’s too early to say anything about the details, these are all extremely sensitive issues, we are discussing and will continue to discuss the modalities of the mission, the route, the number of people who will be involved in this, how long they will stay at the station, for what tasks they are there sent.""

""When the mission can take place -- forecasts do not always come true, but, according to my feelings, we can quite realistically talk about the first days of September, unless some extraneous factors that are not related to the goals arise again,"" Ulyanov said.

Ulyanov said that the organization of the mission is currently being discussed with the IAEA secretariat. 

""Almost every day I communicate with the director general of the agency, Rafael Grossi ... On Monday, he will appear here in Vienna, and work in this direction will intensify,"" Ulyanov said.

The Russian and Ukrainian sides are at odds over the arrangements for such a visit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday an IAEA mission would have to travel only through territory not occupied by Russia.

As for the status of the plant, Ulyanov said: ""So far, there are no serious consequences, but, as the IAEA director general rightly said at an extraordinary meeting of the UN Security Council a week ago, at any moment this could end badly,"" Ulyanov said.

He said the situation at the plant was ""extremely alarming. What the Ukrainian military is doing when shelling this nuclear facility is completely unacceptable,"" he said.

Ukraine has denied shelling the area, and blamed Russia for doing so as a provocation. Some facilities at the plant have been damaged.

Ulyanov said he did not think the IAEA would support Ukraine's insistence that a demilitarized zone around the plant be created.

 ""I think IAEA won't support it, and for one simple reason -- the creation of demilitarized zones has nothing to do with the IAEA's mandate,"" he said.

Russian officials have rejected the idea of demilitarizing the plant, saying that it needs to be protected.

Amid a steady stream of accusations by each side, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Friday that Ukrainian recklessness was to blame for posing ""a threat to the largest nuclear facility in Europe with potential risks for a huge territory, not only adjacent to this plant, but far beyond the Ukrainian borders.""

""Our air defense systems in the region have been strengthened, we are taking all measures to ensure the safety of the station,"" Ryabkov said, according to Russian state news agency TASS.

Ryabkov said that the presence of the Russian military guarding the nuclear plant was a guarantee that such a Chernobyl scenario would not be realized.",False,1660913724.0,t3_ws3zg1,t3_ws3zg1,,0,29,0,29,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 19 August 2022
 
- Russian strikes on residential areas of Kharkiv killed at least 12 civilians on the afternoon of 17 August 2022. Although the front line in this sector has moved little since May, Ukraine's second city has been one of the most consistently shelled since start of the invasion, when Russian forces probably aimed to reach the outskirts with 24 hours.

- Sitting around 15 km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery. Multiple rocket launchers and generally inaccurate area weapons have caused devastation across large parts of the city.

- Russian forces hold the Kharkiv sector relatively lightly but continue to conduct local raids and probing attacks against Ukrainian forces. They are probably trying to force Ukraine to maintain significant forces on this front, to prevent them from being employed as a counter-attack force elsewhere.

We also have countries like Finland and France secretly sending weapons to Ukraine without telling the rest of the world what or how much they're sending.

The only problem is that European countries don't have enough weapons themselves. Ukraine alone has destroyed more Russian tanks than the entire tank fleet of the UK, France and Germany put together.

Since the collapse of the first offensive, this has been a very artillery driven war. This is due to a very specific set of technological conditions: Both sides had strong air defense, and not very good air forces. Russia had thousands of tanks but Ukraine had anti-tank guns that were one or two generations more advanced than 99% of them. 

This meant most modern offense was neutralized and it became a very defensive war. Essentially the only way to move forward was through absolutely massive barrages of low-precision artillery followed by infantry probes. Essentially WW1 tactics but with small infantry advances rather than massive charges. Ukraine couldn't do this because they didn't have enough artillery, so it was a slow, expensive Russian advance, with any Ukrainian advances mostly due to Russian gaps and collapses rather than any real offensive impetus. 

The next turning point of the war was the HIMARS coming online. Now, a lot has been made about Ukraine getting high-precision middle (and long?) range munitions and degrading Russia's ability to advance by blowing their ammo dumps and blunting their artillery advantage. But the more interesting targets are Russian air defenses; a lot of these HARM and GMLRS strikes seem to be on S-300's and S-400's. This combined with removing Russian aircraft from Crimea, and reports of bolder Ukrainian sorties, suggests it may be working to soften Russian air-defense and Ukraine may be slowly gaining air superiority in the south. 

Air superiority would do a lot more to change the actual initiative of this war than blowing ammo dumps. Russia's supplies of artillery shells are practically bottomless, but their supply of surface-to-air platforms is not. If Ukraine starts making regular sorties freely, it will basically neutralize Russian artillery in one go (Artillery is loud and slow and airplanes are super-effective against them). But beyond that it would give Ukraine actual offensive options, which they have lacked, without waiting on western supplies of tanks which may never come.

Not sure about this source but the story it tells seems to be repeated elsewhere so I'm gonna assume it's not making it up

It talks about an amazing and hilarious episode in the early hours of the Russian invasion, where about 80 riot police that were going to be part of the occupation force got into some trouble. Somehow despite starting behind the main invasion force, they overtook the main column and, ordered simply to head to Kyiv and await further instructions, just drove at full speed along the motorway past Hostomel and towards Kyiv, well behind Ukrainian lines.

> “I don’t know what happened,” Lt. Colonel Mikhailovich later wondered. “We rode at the tail of the column, but for some reason, we got in the front, and there was no one else there.”

> How exactly the police officers became separated from the large convoy of mechanized ground forces remains a mystery.

> All of the survivors have maintained that their orders were just to go towards Kyiv, and they’d receive further instructions. If there was a designated rally point outside the capital, none seemed to know about it. Likewise, none of the police officers appear to have had any clue about the plans to recapture the airfield at Hostomel.

After causing some initial confusion (though probably nowhere near as much as their own confusion), they were eventually spotted on CCTV, intercepted, and utterly destroyed. 3 out of 80 survived the ensuing ambush.",1660946303.0,1660945874.0,t3_ws3zg1,t3_ws3zg1,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

# Translation 

*Background*

*...at the end of June, the Serhiy Prytula Foundation, together with blogger Igor Lachenkov, announced the start of side funds for Bayraktar drones. Ukrainians  collected UAH 600 million.  However, Baykar decided to provide three Bayraktar TB-2 drones for free. In this way, the volunteers had the opportunity to direct the collected funds to the purchase of a satellite.
For the 600 million hryvnias that Ukrainians raised for Bayraktar drones, the Serhiy Prytula Foundation bought a satellite and access to a database [for one year] of satellite images for the Ukrainian army.*

*The Strategic Communications Department of the Ukrainian Armed Forces explained that the ICEYE satellites, one of which was bought by the Serhiy Prytula Foundation with funds collected by Ukrainians, will provide a number of significant advantages for the Ukrainian military. The agency also [published an example of images](https://glavcom.ua/country/society/chim-suputnik-iceye-korisnij-ukrajinskij-armiji-868922.html) that this satellite can provide.*


**What is this satellite for Ukraine and the Armed Forces of Ukraine?**

Owning the ICEYE satellite allows Ukraine to receive exclusive images continuously, guaranteed and 24/7 under any weather conditions, despite rain, snow, fog, smog and dust, day and night. These pictures help to plan operations better, and therefore to destroy the enemy more effectively.


**Is it a purchase or a lease?**

According to the agreement, the Ukrainian side receives both the satellite and access to the database of the constellation of satellites.
When the paid period of access to the database expires, this satellite remains in full ownership of Ukraine—until the end of its functionality in orbit.

Further re-registration of the satellite in the relevant registers for Ukraine is planned. This is a legal procedure that takes a certain amount of time, because it requires compliance with the necessary norms, making changes to registers, etc.

The owner of the satellite is Ukraine, and it is the Ukrainian side that determines what and when it shoots, as well as in what format and spectrum we receive data. That is, we fully own, manage and use the images of this satellite.

According to the agreement, the satellite is insured. If something happens to it before the end of the guaranteed period of operation, the seller company undertakes to provide the Ukrainian side with an identical satellite.


**How does it work?**

Unlike an optical satellite, which can only work during the day and in a clear sky, a SAR satellite acts like a lantern—it ""illuminates"" the earth's surface with its own radio waves. Therefore, obstacles, night, clouds, rain, fog, smoke are not important for shooting. The SAR satellite ""pierces"" everything with its radio waves.

**Frequency of flights**

The satellite flies over our territory twice a day. Satellite images of the territory of our country are received only by the Ukrainian side as the owner of the satellite, therefore access is exclusive. When the satellite does not fly over the territory of Ukraine, we can receive data thanks to access to the constellation of SAR satellites of the ICEYE company. Thus, uninterrupted data reception is ensured.

**resolution**

From 0.5 meters to 1 meter depending on the area covered by the picture. One picture can cover an area of ​​up to 225 square kilometers.

**Data acquisition speed**

Foreign partners do provide Ukraine with satellite images, but with a delay.

Due to the fact that Ukraine bought the satellite, the process of data transfer from the moment of the picture to the moment when it is received directly by the military units is shortened to a few hours. In the conditions of war, the speed of receiving information is a significant advantage.",1660933331.0,1660933133.0,t3_ws3zg1,t3_ws3zg1,,0,45,0,45,0,0,

We do not know with any certainty if Ukraine has ATACMS.

None of the footage so far has shown a missile hitting any of the distant targets that are beyond range of known Ukrainian capabilities.

All the footage starts after the first hit. Even when there are different hits, we cannot see a missile incoming.

There are lots of theories about each of the hits and for all we know, any of them could be valid for any of the strikes.

The supposed ATACMS footage from today doesn't definitively show a HIMARS loaded with ATACMS. https://twitter.com/OAlexanderDK/status/1560743445748076546?s=20&t=wVGDaY-gK7ZJJ1ZYa4mlTA

All we know is that the back of the pod is covered. If you search for images of ATACMS pods online, there is nothing distinguishing them from the regular GMLRS pods that we know Ukraine has.

Ok there you go, look at [this grainy ass photo of an ATACMS production line.](https://imgur.com/a/06x6pFs). The photo clearly shows two standard pods that have the exterior shape of six missiles when in fact, the interior clearly shows a round tube meant to contain one ATACMS.

I want to explain how Zelensky looks to westerners. 

There is a stereotype of Slavic nations being ruled by 8000 year old corrupt drunken white haired old dinosaur people who last got an erection before the nose fell off the sphinx. Poroshenko is a perfect example of this stereotype. I have no idea if he is this person, just that I guarantee westerners would see him this way. 

Zelensky by nature of being a young 40 something somewhat handsome man, and his charisma as an actor has allowed him multiple propaganda victories and his willingness to trust his generals to fight the war without micromanaging has been impressive. 

Slavs have a saying ""as insincere as an american smile"", and this isn't far from the truth. American culture is hugely image based, and Zelensky hits the right image for us Americans perfectly. 

Zelensky has been the perfect leader to get the west to give supplies and advanced weapons. I really, really doubt if poroshenko could have done the same thing. We would have just dismissed him as another corrupt drunken white haired old dinosaur slav.  

This is likely why there is a disconnect between Zelensky's popularity abroad and his popularity in Ukraine.",1660964697.0,1660961371.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_il0hhtb,,1,27,0,27,0,0,

If an element of the army tried to take over, they would face elements of the army as well as the population. At a certain point of popularity, you would have a Hugo Chavez situation, where he just resumes power. Of course they could just kill Putin. But once again that would be suicide given his poll numbers at the beginning of this war. 

Because I know this will be mentioned, his polls at the beginning of the war were done by independent pollsters, before the new harsh measures which made even saying something to a friend or on the phone became illegal, so his strong support was considered credible and genuine. At that point as long as you weren't actively working to organize against Putin or a threat, ordinary people could still gripe or say something to pollster. Of course now, with the new laws and the encouragement to snitch on anyone who even talks to a friend about the war, we don't really have any way to guage how Putin's popularity has changed, and whether a coup would be doable or not.

People have gone on quite a bit on the survivability issue, so I'll skip it.    But there are components that require ammunition and specialized equipment on the A-10 that might make it difficult to source from anyone besides the US - namely, the big honking GAU-8.   

If the GAU-8 can't be supplied with enough ammunition and reloaded easily by Ukrainian crews (remember - Ukraine's been keeping their air forces alive by constantly rotating the fields they're operating from), you're talking a potential anchor that may tie them down from operating beyond a certain set of airfields.

Here goes the funniest thing — the same word, ‘chlopok’, but when the 1st syllable is stressed, means ‘cotton’ in English and ‘bavovna’ in Ukrainian.

The TOW is a great choice for having guided capabilities without having to expend the much more numbers limited Javelins on targets they're literally wasted on. The US used them right up until the end in Afghanistan against insurgent operated early APCs (like the BTR-40s) and against homebrew plate armour technicals.

They also have a good track record against helicopters, are potentially very effective against quadcopter and slow flying fixed wing drones, they may well mount on some of the Humvees going, and if not a TOW launcher can be easily fitted to almost any vehicle with a flat bed. They can also be used against defensive entrenchments and bunkers, including the log bunkers we see a lot of in parts of Ukraine.

The TOW is versatile by virtue of being able to be more manually controlled than a fully automated launcher like the Javelin. You can be unconventional in how you use it, which matches well to Ukrainian doctrine so far. Basically, if you're targeting anything other than an MBT there's no reason not to use a TOW and save the Javelins (and NLAWs, AT4s, Panzerfaust 3s etc) for the high value tanks.",1660943019.0,1660942821.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_ikzcy34,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Then follow up with some bayraktars.

while true, easily misleading for those not familiar with the German parliament. **Every** party in the Bundestag gets a vice president. Meaning right now there are 5 different vice president of the German parliament. One for every party except the (right wing/nazi) AFD.*  
  
So Kubicki is indeed moneyhungry jerk, as well as a vice president of the German Bundestag, but not nearly as important as the title might imply. More importantly, he is pretty much isolated with this demand, except for maybe the right wing AFD and left wing Linke. And if these are the only guys who are agreeing with you, it is a good reason to reconsider your standpoint.

Fellow hoser, Kawartha Lakes Oblast

This conflict has changed my world view. Ukraine reminds me a bit of us, large border with world power. Fortunately our neighbour isn't lead by a delusional tyrant, the likes of we haven't seen since the previous world wars.

I always thought we had balls after our performance in WWI and WWII, we were known as among the best even with our small population. Obviously I wasnt around to see it, but have read a lot, and mostly from non hoser sources for a different point of view.

Ukrainians right now remind me a lot of that. Ive followed this since day 1, and man, I feel so much respect for them.

Also, this has changed my view of the US and its military. I was as anti war as you could get going into this, and thought that these kinds of things would never happen again. Well thank god the States is sending them the weapons they need to prevail. Ukraine had the men, they just needed the power.

Watching Russia get rope a doped by Ukraine has been just awesome, as it sends the message that the 20th century land grab mindset is no longer a thing for any civilized nation.

So, I salute you my Ukranian brothers, and my USA neighbours, I salute you guys as well. 

Putin was born 100 years too late, and he needs to pay the price.

Whether Ukraine is winning or losing requires information that i do not have.  Certainly many people who post here are of the opinion that they are winning.  It does appear to be ""a war of attrition"".  Wars of attrition suck for everyone involved in the war.  

Are you expecting USA to fight in Ukraine just as hard as USA fights its own wars?  Is that even reasonable?

The 1991 gulf war is widely considered an ideal model.  Iraq invaded Kuwait August 2 1990.  The first shots were not fired (by USA/coalition) until January 17th 1991.  Heavy ground units started advancing February 24th.  War ended February 28th 1991.  

Saudi Arabia and the gulf states spent decades preparing for Desert Shield/Desert Storm. There were extensive airfields and ports.

The ""will an A10 kill a modern tank"" question is up for debate. Tanks really have a lot of armor, but the A10 fires very big bullets very very fast.

Here's the A10's gun: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:GAU-8_meets_VW_Type_1.jpg

--------

The modern CAS replacement, the AC130, just avoids the question by sticking a 105mm howitzer as the main cannon. No question, that gun will kill a tank, and basically everything else within a 50m radius. The A10's gun just wasn't big enough for the Air Force, so the Air Force got an even bigger one. https://www.businessinsider.com/weapon-on-ac-130-gunship-makes-a-10-warthog-cannon-look-like-a-toy-gun-2018-5",1660939245.0,1660938918.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_ikyxkel,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

The issue with TOW is that you need to manually control the missile (albeit with that neat optical unit, but manually nonetheless). This means that if **someone kills you** while you're spending 20-seconds shooting the missile (and yes, it takes up to 20 seconds for it to reach its target), then the missile veers off course and misses. You have to be a brave soldier to stand there, staring at the target until the missile strikes.

Javelin is fire-and-forget. That means that the Javelin has a computer that will keep homing to its last target. This means you can shoot the missile and **immediately** run away behind cover. If somehow the enemy tank kills you (or a sniper or whatever), the missile will keep homing on the last target and blow it up.

----------

There's a reason why we upgraded our shit to Javelins. So to answer your question:

> Do you imagine Russian BMP's and older tanks have special vatnik magic that makes them immune to TOW missiles?

No. I just know how combat works. Being forced to stay out-of-cover to guide the missile into the target is a high-risk maneuver. I know it fucking works, that's not the problem. The problem is the risk this maneuver poses to the soldiers who use TOW missiles.

That being said, other people have pointed out some advantages of manual aiming that I didn't think of before. So I can see the use, but I still think its high-risk. If the Ukrainians want it (and it seems like the Ukrainians really do have some creative use of manually aimed missiles), then they should have it.",1660949934.0,1660949627.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_ikzw0v2,,2,-2,0,-2,0,0,

They are not doing bad, it seems most other western EU countries escape the medial shit storm easily, thus it seems that most German critism is a targeted effort, if you exclude the others. While the EU contribution kinda shows that EU is united.

Politicans and journalists know Germans bend under much pressure and criticism, because of their eternal guilt feelings after ww2, so they try to get the most money out of it.

What a perfect post.

In any kind of authoritarian regime, there has to be an ""enemy"". Someone who is a threat. They are to be shunned and treated like the animals they are, because if you don't, they will kill you.

Also, you have nothing because the ""insert ethnicity here"" have it all. You have no job because ""insert ethnicity here"" took them all.

North America has become very multicultural. Canada especially. Slavery still exists in some parts of the world, and we even had a modern form of it with ""nannies"" for the rich brought in from other countries.

5cef7035c20141fce18b16399eba4d54,ws3zg1,ikzsgnk,"In 2011 military GPS used 3 signals:

L1 C/A - Unencrypted course acquisition, this is what civilians use.

L1 P(Y) - Precision signal encrypted with the ""Y"" code. Transmitted at the same frequency as L1 C/A.

L2 P(Y) - Precision signal encrypted with the ""Y"" code. Transmitted at different frequency as L1 allowing increased resistance to jamming and dual frequencies to completely remove ionospheric errors. 

It is ""easy"" to jam L2 and leave L1 alone. L1 C/A and L1 P(Y) are transmitted orthogonally to each other. I *think* how they did it is using this method:

1) Jam L2

2) Spoof L1 C/A with 0 meters error compared to true position. The drone at this point still has a correct location fix.

3) Jam L1 quadrature phase so the drone is only using L1 C/A. Even here the drone has a correct location fix.

4a) The drones have inertial navigation systems along with GPS, the errors of these systems grow over time so they are continuously corrected using GPS. 

4b) Slowly pull the spoofed signal away from the true location. This needs to be slow as otherwise the inertial sensors will throw up an warning/error and probably automatically turn around.

5) The drone is programmed to land at an airfield at a specific altitude. Spoof the GPS signal to where you want the drone to land, but it needs to be within ~100 feet elevation of where it was programed to land.

I am an RF engineer who works on communication systems, and I have designed GPS receivers, but all of the above is just my assumptions of how they did it based off of reports I have read.

The GPS satellites are being replaced with new ones that support the M, military, code that has significantly more jamming resistance.

The North Korea scenario explicitly will not be accompanied by regime change. This is when Putin managed to hold on to power through ever repressive means. He loses the war but stays in power. Possible, but not likely. A large part of Russian compliance is based on apathy, not real support. 

Regime change after a lost war is the most likely outcome, but not assured. If there is a regime change, the most likely outcome again is that the new regime will not continue the aggression. They will put blame on Putin and try to restore ties to the west to recover the economic and political position of Russia on the global stage, as this will provide them and their constituencies with the most benefit. Putin's regime right now needs the war to stay in power, and thought the war would aid them politically. A new regime will not need that as they have someone to blame, which Putin does not. 

Lastly, there is a difference in anticipating the most likely outcome and counting on it. Nothing is set in stone and there are no certainties. But back to your original question ""Why would Russia stop?"" Because regime change is the most likely outcome, and the most likely scenario is that the new regime will not continue the war, as there is no advantage in it for them, and they will not get penalized for stopping the war politically speaking - which Putin right now would.

Meaning, the most probably outcome of Russia being pushed out of Ukraine is a change in regime and a cessation of hostilities. That does not mean it's an *assured* outcome, but it certainly must be seen as the *most likely* outcome and should be considered in that light, though clearly planning must take all options into account. 

For now however, Ukraine is still quite a ways from pushing Russia out completely, so it's a very hypothetical situation.",False,1660933035.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_ikyqf3u,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Yes after the chaos of the 90's things did improve when Putin came to power but things aren't so good anymore are they? I'm not saying I think another revolution is likely but neither would I say revolt is rare when the last one happened barely 30 years ago.

Yes, it's a diaspora. That's expected behaviour.

> . Regardless, they don’t deny that people like Putin. Putin and his war is generally popular with Russians both inside and outside

So they say it's true so it must be true. There's actual research and data on this subject by real scientists. I will opt to follow that instead if you don't mind.

>  You can’t put a nation through a 70 year communist dictatorship and then through 30 year dictatorship of a different form and suddenly expect their society to be “Western”. 

Didn't say I expected them to be ""western"". Just said that they, like most normal people, don't want war.

> Their thinking is backwards and nationalistic and you are clueless if you are trying to understand them from a Western perspective because their framework is simply different.

Please stop projecting your assumptions onto me. I'm not trying to understand them from a western perspective. I'm looking at the numerous articles that have been written and linked in this thread about this. Fact is that polling response has dropped significantly since the war started, fact is that when asked neutral/non-threatening questions the responses swap in favour of peace and noninterference. These are pieces of evidence that point to a largely scared and subjugated population that simply don't want any trouble from the regime, not fanatical zealots that support Putin through everything. I will take that factual data every day over your hearsay stories and jaded assumptions.


But whatever man, you really want to have a certain idea about Russians. I get it, that's fine. If you live in a country with a significant Russian minority, that's easy to understand. But fact is, you are cherrypicking your data, you want to believe these are ignorant inferior people who are all stupid and love Putin. It's simply not true. 

Ask yourself this: if this was really the majority of Russia. Then why hasn't Putin mobilized? He desperately needs it. His military has been clamoring for it for months. And yet he resists. If they all supported him so much, it wouldn't be an issue right? 

The truth, as it often is, is simply in looking at what's important. If Russia were as you painted it to be, there would have been full mobilization, without a doubt. The fact that there hasn't been, should make you start to doubt your own assumptions, if you are intellectually honest enough for that.",False,1660951036.0,t3_ws3zg1,t1_ikzyc5a,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

3f09a1cb8b14f34c25f739eafd21e523,ws3zg1,il0734d,"The only concrete data we have show Putin has wide support. The data we have from after the Crimea invasion which was a time where there were no laws about discrediting the military showed Putin had a significant rise in support. You can speculate about all the surrounding data all you want but if the war was unpopular there would be protests, and big ones. Before you say it’s difficult to protest in Putin’s Russia I will point you to the last whole decade where numerous times there were massive violent protests. Yes, it’s tougher than in the West but if the Russians want to protest they will. The truth is not only does the data show a rise in Putin’s popularity but a renewed optimism that the country is on the right path which tracks with the data after the Crimea annexation.

I have never said that Russians are stupid or inferior. They are different to Western Europe which is where all the misunderstandings come from. Only Eastern Europe understands the Russian mindset, because it’s very similar to the mindset our grandparents had. Nationalism, conservatism and exceptionalism. 

Why hasn’t Putin mobilised? Many reasons. First of all, to mobilise he would need to galvanise the population. You don’t start a “special operation” and then down the line mobilise without a narrative. Americans are scarily patriotic but look at what 9/11 did. No point in mobilisation without fanning the flames first. Secondly, you made a major mistake by overlooking the fact that Russians can support the war without wishing to fight themselves. Thirdly, and most importantly the cost. Transitioning a country of 140 million to a war economy will take time, have massive internal costs and will probably be faced with a complete trade embargo. Then there’s the possibility of a war with NATO which is off the cards. Any return to normalcy at any point in the foreseeable future will be doubtful. So of course mobilisation is an option but it’s a massive risk and not an easy solution as you present it. And as a matter of fact older surveys show that most Russians are willing to fight for their country if they are attacked and I guess I don’t need to explain how easy that would be to sell.

What I have said about Russia and Russian society, is not something I pulled out of my ass and it’s things people much more qualified than me, have studied, have talked and are talking about. The problem arises from typical Western universalism and it’s not a mystery why the closer you go to Russia the more anti-Russia the people. They have memories and they understand the mindset. No one in Eastern Europe has a realistic fear that French imperial nostalgia will take over or German nostalgia for the reich or that the Swedish empire will make a comeback. Everyone is legitimately worried about Russian expansionism because the Kremlin has aspirations and society allows/encourages them. Keep in mind that while Western Europe and Western society has repented for it’s colonial and World War sins, Russia never has, not even for its soviet sins. A proud Belgian/Austrian/Dutch/Norwegian is nothing like a proud Russian in this context.
