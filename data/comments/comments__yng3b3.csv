Day 256 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day with no missile strikes or drones, though at one point we did think that missiles might be flying in our direction, but a bit later we found out that explosions happened in Belgorod oblast and that an oil depot was hit there, which is always great to see. After that nothing much happened throughout the day, it was pretty uneventful and that is not a bad thing at all.

There’s a big chance that tomorrow morning we will be hit with yet another big wave of Russian missiles aimed at our energy infrastructure. They pretty much always do their big missiles strikes in the morning on Mondays, and it will probably happen again. There’s also a good chance that NASAMS are already here and operational, which is what Zelenskyy was hinting at just recently when he was talking about incoming good news concerning our air defense. Hopefully we will be able to intercept much higher percent of missiles from their next missile strike.

It’s also interesting seeing that just a week ago Russians were posting about their “big victories” in Pavlivka which is under Vuhledar. They were saying that our first line of defense had “disintegrated” and that they will be in Vuhledar soon. But today Russians suddenly started doomposting, saying that everything is lost in Pavlivka, most people are dead and the assault has completely failed. Always great to see Russian plans crumble before their eyes. And apparently people that were assaulting Pavlivka weren’t new conscripts either, but their regular army plus marines, which means that this loss is even more serious for them.

The staff lit some candles, we had gas heaters, and the place remained packed.

He and his wife had been “unlucky enough” to live adjacent to the local school—the premises that Russians “had local girls come to” [unclear if implying rapes were happening or prostitution]—but were ordered “not even to look in that direction”—and he and his pregnant wife complied.

After kidnapped, Balan says he was not killed bc he was not originally *from* the village of Velika Oleksandrivka^1 —so others taken to the basements didn’t know his work history, and thus no one ever disclosed under torture that he was ATO (the precursor to the Territorial Defense Forces).  When the Russians found a tattoo in German on his ribs, it solidified in their minds they found a Nazi.  The electrocutions were so bad, he broke—he told them where he buried his weapons (or more accurately, *some* of the buried weapons).  They seized the weapons, then tried to bargain with him, to become one of theirs, they’d even promote to a chief of police.  He declined.  He probably would’ve been let go, but the Russians found packed suitcases and forbid traveling to anywhere but Russia.

He was transferred around to different places of custody around Kherson, different levels of torture—when he was in the left bank, he was in a cell with ten others, the Russians had found a German Cross on another captive, and told them they’d all be killed if it was still there later.  They were then forced to hold him down, cut the skin off their fellow captive. 

He eventually was released, a few days before the wife was to give birth—he arrived home and he had to deliver his daughter himself, as the Russians would not allow going to hospital!  

The Russians have been driven out of his village.  And he dug up those other weapons, going back to policing.

Analyzing the situation in retrospect, because in real time I didn’t fully understand, it is clear Ukraine knew Russia would attack at least 7-10 days prior to the attack. And they were fully prepared. When Ukraine made those preparations, Russia should have aborted.

Rather than aborting, Russia sent all their men to their death. They’ve sustained crippling casualties and achieved nothing.

>On 03 November 2022, Major General Alexander Linkov was reportedly appointed acting commander of Russia's Central Military District. Linkov replaces Colonel General Alexander Lapin who was purportedly removed from office at the end of October 2022.

>If confirmed, this follows a series of dismissals of senior Russian military commanders since the onset of the invasion in February 2022. The Commanders of the Eastern, Southern, and Western Military Districts were replaced earlier this year.

>Lapin has been widely criticised for poor performance on the battlefield in Ukraine by both Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Wagner head Yevgeny Prigozhin.

>These dismissals represent a pattern of blame against senior Russian military commanders for failures to achieve Russian objectives on the battlefield. This is in part likely an attempt to insulate and deflect blame from Russian senior leadership at home.

A man who lived his younger life as an agent trying to steal free societies tech and ideas to prop up a failing dream.

Then it collapses and he finds a way into power due to the KGB needing a safely corrupt piece of shit to help them steal and control of Russia's resources for themselves, a loyal and corrupt puppet.

Since taking power all he's done is be a coward, pretending he's not a dictator behind total bullshit legal pretences as he murdered or imprisoned any opposition via cowardly methods.

He pretended to defend Russia as he and his cronies pilfered Russia for themselves.

Russians must wonder why they are getting their asses kicked in Ukraine? Why the ""conscripts"" have no weapons? No armour? No clothes? No food? Why they are used like dog meat in front of a pitbull? 

All while Putin and his KGB mafia steal all the countries money, resources, future, and dreams?

They let a dictactor hollow out their entire nation into a corrupt shit hole.

One man and his mafia, has totally ruined what could be a vibrant, open, wealthy, and free nation.

So the assholes could chase fantasies of past glories, at the expense of innocent men, women, and children of all the entire region and world.

> The reason it didn't happen before October is that Russia had the Crimean bridge. After the rail line was hit, both sides knew how important it was for Russia to push Ukraine further back from the rail line by Marinka and Pavlivka and both began preparing.

So this is russia being desperate to keep any sort of railway supply lines operating in the South. They can't have Ukraine pounding those rails with artillery. It is a make or break situation, and so far the result is a break.

Wasn't it around there where Ukraine was generating force too? We thought it were for an offensive (and still could be), but Ukraine probably also could evaluate ahead of time where the most intense battles would be fought once the Kerch bridge became unoperational.

Without precision munitions though they are required to do low altitude attacks which leaves them slow and vulnerable to every form of antiair in existence including an autocannon on an IFV.

Now? While they technically have the numbers to gain air control they again don't have the correct type of munitions. Namely SEAD.

Storm Shadow is the weapon's British appellation.

The missile is based on the French-developed Apache anti-runway cruise missile.

To me it just seems like a way to keep those people happy to pretend some type of negotiation or diplomacy is happening or at least publicly being open to it even though many might argue Putin will only respect power so looking weak and willing to speak might only bait him into thinking concessions is close.",False,1667742743.0,t3_yng3b3,t1_iv9yuy9,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

Failed to me means some effort was put into destroying them. There are many reasons the Air Force would just not try to destroy them including loss of life of civilians and bad PR from civilian infrastructure being hit.  Alongside it not being important from a mission perspective. 

Scuds were fired into Israel in the hopes of other Muslim countries becoming involved. They killed no one during the war, but caused some damage. HIMARS are the reason Ukraine is now on the offensive. They are a high value target of the Russian military. Basically I’m saying the comparison isn’t a great one.

Wars don't work that though, they are usually short spurts of large territory gains followed by long stretches of consolidation. September was the largest territorial gain of the AFU since the beginning of the war taking back thousands of square miles in a matter of weeks, and it while some of the peeling back of Russian forces from natural obstacles extended into October, most of that month was a consolidation period for Ukraine. 

Likewise the campaign in Kherson looks pretty slow going, but there will come a breaking point like in Kharkiv where the AFU will likely take the city and most of the surrounding countryside all at once. And every time these campaigns are successful it frees up Ukrainian forces to join another front.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNNoaRp5lz0

tl'dr and iirc - they still have tons in storage, all the sites still had 75% of their stocks.  ( Something like 25 thousand T-72's were built , even if two thirds went to foreign buyers it's an enormous number. )

So the real question becomes what is the condition of those tanks in storage, and how capable is Russia of servicing them and repairing them and putting them back into service.

At this point - a better way of gagueing how things are going, would be to draw a graph over time of how many Russian tanks the Ukranians report as destroyed.  When that number starts significantly dropping, if it can't be linked to changes in Russian behaviour... 

So, anyone have a graph of the tank loss numbers day by day?

Russia annexed the parts of the country they hold, and according to their constitution, no part of Russia can be broken off - it is treason. So the only thing the Russians could offer is not to take any more territory.

Do you think it is acceptable for Russia to invade, annex, and Ukraine to forced to “negotiate” to legalize the annexations?

Because that is what is on the table here. Your talk about St Petersburg and Vladivostok is either nonsensical or spoken in bad faith. Ukraine is not the aggressor here, they have never in any shape or form threatened the territorial sovereignty of Russia. Their troops are on their own territory, attempting to push to their own borders and expel and invading army.

The Democrats positions in practice on healthcare, student debt, welfare payments, have been in line what what these countries would consider the far fringe of their right wing parties. There's no serious politicians in these countries publicly advocating for privatized healthcare, for-profit student loans, or minimal welfare as democrats continually vote towards. You can look at Nordic countries and comparably wealthy countries across Europe and see basically the same thing. 

Democrats do sometimes say they do support these obvious measures. In practice it's just not true. The last time Democrats got power they refused to implement any of these positions. It's also notable that US states are allowed to raise taxes and could fund these programs - so it's not just a few times they've been in control of both federal houses, but we can look at every time they control a state and their complete inaction.

It should be noted theses aren't left positions. Free healthcare, non-profit student loans, and reasonable welfare, are centrist positions. Each one pays itself off by it's economic benefit and is a morally good thing to do. It doesn't make you left wing to support these positions that are the norm of most comparable countries.

*During the Third Period, the KPD (the creators of Antifa) viewed the Nazi Party ambiguously. On one hand, the KPD considered the Nazi Party to be one of the fascist parties. On the other hand, the KPD sought to appeal to the Strasserite-wing of the Nazi movement by using nationalist slogans. The KPD sometimes cooperated with the Nazis in attacking the SPD. In 1931, the KPD had united with the Nazis, whom they referred to as ""working people's comrades"", in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down the SPD state government of Prussia by means of a referendum.In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.*

*The KPD regarded the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as its main adversary and adopted the position that the SPD was the main fascist party in Germany. This was based on the theory of social fascism that had been proclaimed by Joseph Stalin and that was supported by the Comintern during the late 1920s and early 1930s, which held that social democracy was a variant of fascism.*

The hypothetical experiment would involve checking if junior officers would have refused the invasion orders in February 2022.  Political science and history are not testable in this way.  

""Sufficient deterrent"" is poorly defined.  If your deterrent is strong enough that junior officers take a few small steps toward reducing the number of crimes then the deterrent had some value.  Perhaps it is insufficient to prevent a war, but in some village an officer tells his troops to avoid making him look bad.  Sometimes that might be a really weak effect like commanders order troops to cover up the evidence.  That inconvenience can still greatly reduce the number of tortured or dead civilians.  It matters to the one person not tortured.  

Most of what I see on reddit is not mentioning the war crimes at all.  People are actually suggesting that Russia should be allowed to walk out with none of them prosecuted.  

It should be a risk all future warriors are at least aware of.  If you stand up and moon the enemy you might get shot in the backside.  If you commit war crimes you might get prosecuted for war crimes.  Russian soldiers are posting their war crimes on social media.

But, we are outnumbered by new people coming in here and asking silly questions or making ridiculous claims/comments, we are inundated with trolls constantly. Most of the time, it's people just wanting to know something more than what their local news channel is telling them.

What I mean is, the reality is the available information we have in the moment. Like I said, none of us can tell the future, but, following trends of support, trends of actions on the battlefield, trends of actions within Russia, etc can lead people to conclusions and that doesn't mean they're detached from reality.

It's becoming more and more likely every day that Ukraine will exit this war favorably (it's not lost on me that ""favorably"" isn't the right word here - Ukrainians are dying every single day, so there is no favorable situation for Ukraine right now).

We can only take leaders at their word. Many have dedicated support ""for as long as it takes"". In 6 months? No one knows. A year or two? No one truly knows. We're all living in the reality of the moment as this war unfolds for us daily. Macron and Scholz both have waffled on things they've said, but, it's unlikely they would be the only two hold-outs for keeping Ukraine out of NATO if every other country was on board.

No one wants the war to continue (except Russia). They show this every single day by continuing their wasted efforts. How can you even genuinely ask ""but what if it does?"" If Russia was serious about negotiations, they would stop attacking. They would pull their troops. They would make an actual effort to show they no longer want to pursue these fruitless efforts.

But they don't. They don't do any of these things. This is why your line of questioning doesn't fit inside of the reality we've all been experiencing since February 24th. Russia has lied at every single turn. They have fabricated. They have gone back on their word.

What I think is missing entirely in this perspective though is how exactly officers of a nuclear power with thousands of strategic nuclear warheads would ever be put into a position of having to answer for any crimes in front of a tribunal composed of international judiciaries - it seems entirely a hypothetical thought experiment to me, because of the following two hypotheses:

1) only the outright losers of a war will ever be put in front of the tribunal of the winners

2) a strategic nuclear power will never lose a war to a sufficient extent for 1) to take place, as they would always escalate and flip the board in a last-ditch attempt to ensure at least a stalemate rather than concede outright and utter defeat
