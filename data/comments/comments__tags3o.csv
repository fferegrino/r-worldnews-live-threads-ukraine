The Ukrainian Navy shared details of the operation which was aimed to destroy the modern Russian patrol boat '\[Vasily\] Bykov' in Black Sea two days ago. Burned out, it finally sank today  
  
As the Odesa-based newspaper Dumskaya reported, it was a specially designed secret operation of the Ukraine Navy. Two Ukrainian speedboats provoked the Russian boat to follow them, so it sailed right into the prepared area of artillery fire and was successfully destroyed.  
  
The Dumskaya claims that this is for the first time in the world military history when the military vessel was destroyed by the land-based MLRS system. (To be verified by historians).",False,1646858981.0,t3_tags3o,t3_tags3o,,0,586,0,586,0,0,

Day 14 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today the sound of artillery‚Äôs or a tank‚Äôs shooting continued again and sometimes it sounded like it was extremely close to us, it‚Äôs probably our army‚Äôs artillery or a tank, but that is also scary in the sense that if there‚Äôs return fire it might hit nearby buildings, and there‚Äôs only residential buildings nearby.

Actually there hasn‚Äôt been any major shelling in the past 2 days as our governor said that their artillery that was previously shelling my district was destroyed in a counter attack just yesterday and right now it‚Äôs mostly quiet, though some explosions still can be heard there are far fewer of them.

I'm actually starting to think the idea of 'Because X country has nuclear weapons, they can do what they want' isn't fully correct. Has the US committed atrocities? Yes. Absolutely. No disagreement here. Has China? Yes. Of course.

But I feel like there's a massive difference between US/China and Russia.

The US does what what wants (much to the chagrin of voters) not because 'it has nukes' it's because they have the biggest, most powerful military in the world. I HONESTLY have zero doubt that the US, especially the military, ever REALLY even entertains the idea of ACTUALLY using nuclear weapons. They don't wave them around to ward people off, as we've seen with this crisis, they carefully (and correctly) avoid nuclear escalation rhetoric. 

China doesn't get messed with because, well, outside of the Uighers thing (I have no idea if I spelled that right,) what China normally does is their 'Belt and Road Initiative.' They use their financial means to build up infrastructure of lesser countries and make those countries look to China for help more often. Which, in that case there's no reason to even go after China. They've done nothing militarily to provoke it (yet.) China uses its economy as its weapon and they know that.

India, Pakistan those countries have been going at it with other countries and both have nukes and nothing has come of it, and as far as I've seen, nukes have never even been threatened.

North Korea is North Korea. No need to say more.

Russia on the other hand, constantly and consistently threatens the Use of its nuclear arsenal, whether tactical or otherwise. They either threaten it bluntly or (attempted) subtly. They have the West fearing about a possible 'escalate to de-escalate' doctrine using nuclear weapons. They constantly chest-puff about their nuclear modernization. They have a leader who seems to be stuck in a rather dangerous mindset, which makes the nuclear threat all the more serious.",1646858214.0,1646858068.0,t3_tags3o,t3_tags3o,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Allow the military to keep their secrets and have their talks. They should be lying to us. 

A beautiful moment in the Gulf War was Schwarzkopf talking about how he used the press to mislead the enemy about their real actions, to which a reporter asked, ""Is there anything else we helped you with?""

Think about it like this.  They are watching Russia, probably their primary rival in the region, completely obliterate itself economically to the point they are desperate for anything.  China is going to have Russia by the balls for decades after this since nobody else will touch them.    
   
Meanwhile they are learning everything they need to know about how the world will react to one country claiming another as it's own.  This is invaluable research for a possible Taiwan invasion.  They now know how far the west is willing to go to aid the invaded nation and also what they are not willing to do.  
  
Now consider that China's military is far superior to Russia's and their ability to countersanction the world if they are sanctioned for invading Taiwan is also much more dangerous.  The world is far more dependent on Chinese goods than we are on Russia.  In short they hit harder and take harder hits.    
  
And finally consider that with Taiwan out of the picture, China would become an almost exclusive provider of computer chips to the world, able to name their price.  All of this is already troubling enough, but the gravy is they've managed to remain out of this war in any meaningful way.  They aren't suffering anything from taking Russia's side and they aren't getting the worst of the economic blowback that Europe and Asia are from oil costs.  If anything they'll be able to buy Russian oil on the cheap soon as the only customer, again naming their price.

I find it hard to imagine Ukraine does not understand this. Therefore are we back to the idea that the continued asks for a NFZ and more jets is in order to pressure Western countries to step up additional sanctions and keep sending the other weapons?

‚ÄúItalian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini had imperial ambitions in Abyssinia. Italy was already in possession of neighbouring Eritrea and Somalia. In December 1934, there was a clash between Italian and Abyssinian troops at Walwal, near the border between British and Italian Somaliland, in which Italian troops took possession of the disputed territory and in which 150 Abyssinians and 50 Italians were killed. When Italy demanded apologies and compensation from Abyssinia, Abyssinia appealed to the League, Emperor Haile Selassie famously appealing in person to the assembly in Geneva. The League persuaded both sides to seek a settlement under the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 but Italy continued troop movements and Abyssinia appealed to the League again. In October 1935 Mussolini launched an attack on Abyssinia. The League declared Italy to be the aggressor and imposed sanctions, but coal and oil were not included; blocking these, it was thought, would provoke war. Albania, Austria, and Hungary refused to apply sanctions; Germany and the United States were not in the League. Nevertheless, the Italian economy suffered. The League considered closing off the Suez Canal also, which would have stopped arms to Abyssinia, but, thinking it would be too harsh a measure, they did not do so.‚Äù",False,1646872707.0,t3_tags3o,t3_tags3o,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

As the name suggests, it's literally called a ""commodity"" because each molecule within the product is interchangeable with the other.

Because of that there is a globally standard price. When you hear ""the oil price"" on TV, that's what it is. When supply goes up, all things equal, the price comes down.

People who say Keystone XL won't help prices don't understand how this market works. It doesn't matter where the oil _actually_ travels.

We operate under a capitalist system. Every market participant is making their own decision. Someone in Texas could sell the oil they receive from a pipeline for local use, or export it to Japan, or Mexico, or Taiwan. Meanwhile someone in New York might be buying crude oil from the Saudi Arabia, someone from Michigan could be buying from Canadian refineries via rail, or someone in LA might be buying bunker fuel from India. But if there is more oil around, even if some of it goes to say Mexico, the price is still lower for an average driver in Oregon.

Bottom line: More supply = lower prices. All other things equal.

NASIC is a component of the U.S. Air Force, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It is self-described as ""the Department of Defense's primary source for foreign air and space threat analysis.""

The new law also requires quarterly reports to Congress on UFO/UAP phenomenon. A previous statute enacted a few months ago had only required yearly reports. Prior to December 2021, there was no law requiring continuing UFO/UAP research or reporting.

Last thread locked so I'll continue here.

You claim that NATO would say the same thing, but with the caveat that they would not protect their non-member allies.

I'll posit to you a hypothetical scenario, generalised. A global nuclear power attacks a key trading partner of NATO, that is not a NATO member. I can think of at least one scenario in which that would absolutely trigger a NATO response and many more that would have the potential.

Let's construct two unlikely but not implausible scenarios.

1. A Chinese invasion of Australia. I cannot see any situation in which that does not draw in the majority if not entirety of NATO in support of Australia. Granted, the Aukus pact between Australia, the US, and the UK exists, so it automatically draws two key NATO players, but I can see all of NATO moving to aid Australia militarily without significant hesitation. The prime reason Australia is *not* a NATO member is down to geography alone, and the practicality of coordinating it with a pan-European military machine that has no rapid logistical link or established strategic deployment, unlike say the US presence in Europe. However, because of its geographic isolation combined with its military support for NATO members in past conflicts, that's precisely the reason I could see NATO intervening.

2. An Indian attack on Singapore. Unlikely, granted, but Singapore's approval of India has cooled and in this hypothetical world, India makes a military decision against another neighbour that Singapore's markets sanction, and India retaliates in a show of force. This one presents a more interesting hypothetical for me, and perhaps goes further the other way than the Russia-Ukraine argument. Singapore is a huge economic hub that the West relies on, but military intervention in this scenario might produce uncertain results, particularly given that Singapore has little military power of its own. Presumably, the Five Power Defence Arrangement is triggered which draws in a significant portion of the British Commonwealth, including the UK and Australia, and that might be a sufficient response / deterrent for further escalation. I can see the rest of NATO being more hesitant on this one, although Singapore has substantial strategic and economic value.

So, I think where I'm going with this is that there are potentially grounds for NATO to engage, or not, in the defence of a non-member ally. Ukraine is a particularly interesting situation given that it has had the opportunity in the past to join NATO but was not successful - that arguably counts against it as a reason to defend it, but also opens up the counterargument that Ukraine is a vulnerable target precisely *because* it was an unsuccessful NATO candidate in the past.",False,1646858516.0,t3_tags3o,t3_tags3o,,0,0,0,0,0,0,

There's definitely been a lot of bad faith whataboutism by Russia apologists + blaming ""NATO aggression"" to deflect from what Russia's doing, but some of you really are acting like this is the first time in history that innocent civilians have been killed (even intentionally) and hospitals/schools have been bombed. It's evil and tragic, but it's not unprecedented (besides our access to raw information about it.) And I know it's uncomfortable to think about, but nobody has done more of this in the last half-century than the United States. It's not even close either.

The main reason I point this out is because a lot of you say shit like ""what are we gonna do, just stand by and do NOTHING?"" as if rightfully sanctioning Russia + sending Ukraine billions of dollars of advanced weaponry + training their military + providing intel is nothing. Even worse, some people say ""Nuclear winter wouldn't even be that bad."" This sounds like the bloodthirsty American media and political establishment before Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Vietnam, etc. It turns you into fucking chumps who fall for every single piece of mis and disinformation imaginable. The fog of war makes nobody immune to this, but don't treat it like a spectator sport. You lose your humanity as result.

And how would you feel if the rest of the world demanded that ""something be done"" to combat the U.S. slaughtering literally millions of innocent civilians across the globe? The U.S. knows it is above international law. It has an [insanely evil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Service-Members%27_Protection_Act) that prevents Americans from being tried in the International Criminal Court by ""all means necessary."" You cannot deny that America has never been held to the same standard that Russia is being (rightfully) held to now. Stop acting like everyone who points this out is engaging in whataboutism. Pointing out the double standard is NECESSARY if we want to build a better world for all nations and end imperialism altogether. As the climate crisis hits, do you think the United States would be above invading another country if deemed ""necessary?"" Do you think American officials give a shit about human rights when the rubber hits the road in their eyes? Look how the U.S. and Europe treat migrants from the Global South now. It will only get worse unless something changes. 

Have some perspective and don't become irrational, hypocritical, or jingoistic. We're seeing what it looks like when an imperialist nuclear power knows it can destroy another country without military intervention from the broader enemy--all livestreamed to the internet. We're not heroes standing up for human rights by opposing Putin--the Ukrainians are. We're advancing our self-interest by seeing our enemy crush itself from within.

Putin reinforces the Suwalki corridor, says that any attempt at aggression will be met with a tactical nuke, and separates the Baltics from Europe. What is our response? If you say ""nuclear war because Article 5"", that is just a lazy and unserious response.

Say we call his bluff and ""attack"" whatever he has done with the Suwalki corridor, he then launches a tactical nuke at an unmanned NATO installation causing no fatalities. Do we respond in kind with a nuclear bomb? Is it in our best interest to escalate this to nuclear war when we have a considerable advantage conventionally but not nuclear?

The jet thing is overblown because Poland could not keep a secret and decided to telegraph to Russia where a delivery point was.

At this point the idea is to continue to have the 'world' in general donate 'goods' in general and deliver them. Volunteer fighters are arriving, cash and materiel are arriving.

If I'm reading the US correctly, they're hoping that level of group contribution means nobody gets singled out of the international community. It's not a bad strategy overall and it's a good example to future nations (say China) who might want to invade Taiwan. ""We as a group will donate bits and drabs of our military and kick your ass.""

Now, US might be donating A TON of stuff and making it look like Ukrainians are doing it all themselves. I'm okay with that.

What I would compare this to is a particularly arduous migration of wildebeest in Africa. There's a river they all have to cross but it's filled with crocodiles. The first one in gets dramatically ripped to shreds in seconds, but millions of them get to pass with only a few casualties afterward. 

Nobody wants to be the first wildebeest and they're hanging out on the other side of the river waiting.

Doesn't seem like ammonia can be used as a weapon on its own, but: 

>Ammonia has some role as a precursor in the production of certain chemical warfare agents. The so-called Andrussow process and the BMA process for making the chemical warfare agent (and industrial chemical) hydrogen cyanide (HCN) use ammonia.  
>  
>Ammonia is also used in the production of the nerve agent Tabun. The   
manufacture of Tabun generally starts with a chemical compound known as   
dimethylamine. Dimethylamine can be produced from ammonia and methanol,   
and it was thus produced in Nazi Germany. Tabun manufacture also   
requires hydrogen cyanide, which can be produced from ammonia as above.   
However, this is the very beginning of a lengthy process and having   
ammonia is no indicator of Tabun production, as it is quite far down the  
 supply chain of chemicals and processes needed to make Tabun.",False,1646865591.0,t3_tags3o,t1_i015a3q,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

 >Appeasement in an international context is a  diplomatic policy of making political, material, or territorial concessions to an aggressive  power in order to avoid conflict. The term is most often applied to the foreign policy of the UK governments of Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald (in office: 1929‚Äì1935), Stanley Baldwin (in office: 1935‚Äì1937) and (most notably) Neville Chamberlain (in office: 1937‚Äì1940) towards Nazi Germany (from 1933) and Fascist Italy (established in 1922) between 1935 and 1939.

[How to reach someone who has been radicalized ‚Äî Mindful Communications](https://mindfulcommunications.eu/en/prevent-radicalization)

Self discovery is an important part of deprogramming someone.

Make general statements that will get him to evaluate things on his own. For example, ""lately you seem angry all the time."" Then change the subject to something less contentious.

Direct confrontation will only make him more resistant. Nudge him gently while reinforcing that you care about and accept him.

Putin supported Trump from the beginning and Trump's campaign had several high level connections to the Russian government. This is an established finding by multiple bipartisan government committees and investigations. Trump's initial reaction to the invasion was almost positive, complimenting Putin (as he done many times before) for being ""smart"". Only when his position proved to be unpopular, he started highlighting the negative aspects of the invasion. And unlike what you may think, American politics do not dictate what happens in the rest of the world. This invasion would have happened under any US president. The difference now is that Biden actually spent time to create an international coalition that actually managed to come together. He has been working on that for months. Trump did not have the trust of the Europeans and considered himself Putin's friend. The international response would have been much weaker if he was in office. Which is exactly why Putin supported Trump's election bids. Additionally, Trump is literally the one who withheld 400 million dollars in defense aid from Ukraine for personal political reasons, a fact made additionally suspect by his elaborate Russian ties. To think that this wouldn't have happened under Trump is a self-conceited nonsensical talking point that is not based in fact or even reality, and betrays an extremely narcissist world view in which everything revolves around him. This invasion has nothing to with the US president or even the US, and everything to do with Putin, his perceived legacy, a shrinking window of opportunity and a whole host of other things none of which are about who sits in the oval office.""",1646874355.0,1646873632.0,t3_tags3o,t1_i01nkkc,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

But taking the assets, you have to be really sure that the person is Funding Putin. You also risk alienating other nationals who own property and assets in your country, as they may feel that the government could take the assets for no fault of their own. So you may see a flash sale, which could cause problems (although would likely lower house prices which is only a good thing).

On the other hand, they might do it with the reasoning that the war is costing them money, and it costs money to re-home those fleeing. So seizing and selling the assets helps raise capital toward those goals.

I could see it go eithe way, but for me it's more likely not.

P.s. I say lowering house prices is a good thing. Obviously not for people like myself who do own a house.

More planes doesn't automatically mean air superiority. The reason NATO has the potential to achieve a no fly zone is because they can come in and knock out any radar and surface to air missiles from miles away. 

So long as the ground is littered with S400 and S300 no one can really use the air space without risking their planes.

* One - General logistics. Nobody wants to donate all these planes to Ukraine and then it turns out that Ukraine does not have enough mechanics / supplies etc. to keep most of them actually airworthy. Nobody wants to be the guy that delivered all this and then it turns out you were basically throwing them into a giant hole in the ground and wasting them.
* Two - Stingers and Anti-tank weapons are more or less defensive weapons. They can only attack things that wander into their area of influence. Or, if used offensively, can only advance as much as the soldier using them. Aircraft are the exact opposite of that. Even if it isn't likely, nobody wants to donate these and then it turns out some Ukrainian general had the bright idea to use them to do an airborne strike on Moscow. The Ukrainians could use these in ways that are more escalatory than other weapons they've been given.
* Three - the actual transfer. Nobody wants to be the one to actually deliver these. Anti-tank weapons can be discreetly brought in via regular cargo trucks at the border. The planes need to fly in. So, say we do the original Polish donation to US plan. Ukrainian pilots take a train to Germany and pick the planes up at the American Airforce base. Now you've got a big potential problem.

Both Ukraine and Russia would say no to this

A. Ukraine doesn't want Russia anywhere near crimea especially its a strategic point

Both Ukraine and Russia would both say no to this

A. There's a real chance that they would vote to leave so Ukraine would never accept that

B. Putin doesn't actually care about what they want, so the risk of Donbass rejecting independence would be something they would never accept

 >The Capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder on the night of 23 January 1795 presents a rare occurrence of an interaction between warships and cavalry, in which a French Revolutionary Hussar regiment came close to a Dutch fleet frozen at anchor in the Nieuwediep (river), just east of the town of Den Helder. After some of the Hussars had approached across the frozen Nieuwediep (river), the French cavalry negotiated that all 14 Dutch warships would remain at anchor. A capture of ships by horsemen is an extremely rare feat in military history.

We see a few videos of protesting and Russians hating Putin, but the general population now believe Putin is saving Ukraine and protecting Russia with this ""special military operation"".

The majority are still supporting Putin, if Ukraine lose this Putin will be able to spin it into being ""the biggest victory"" against their ""enemies"" and further deepen his influence on the people. Which is why every country supporting Ukraine, needs to keep it up, we can't just turn our backs on them or get complacent thinking ""this is good enough"". It won't be good enough until Russian troops go home.

I think you've seen a few protest arrests and disgruntled Russian civilians and now have this false idea that the majority are opposing Putin. Unfortunately it's still far from true and I Too, don't understand how the major majority of Russian people can still stand by that pathetic monster. If this isn't enough to light a spark in them, then I don't know what the hell will.",False,1646863373.0,t3_tags3o,t1_i00zy3d,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

... Sustained by scholarship, peanut butter and a sense of mission, American Bryan Rigg is exploring an eerie and uncharted no man‚Äôs land of Holocaust history.

Rigg interviews former German soldiers of Jewish heritage, some of them high-ranking officers, who fought for Adolf Hitler‚Äôs Third Reich in World War II--during the Holocaust, when the Nazis slaughtered 6 million Jews.

‚ÄúThousands of men of Jewish descent and hundreds of what the Nazis called ‚Äòfull Jews‚Äô served in the military with Hitler‚Äôs knowledge. The Nazis allowed these men to serve but at the same time exterminated their families,‚Äù Rigg said.

Rigg said he has documented the Jewish ancestry of more than 1,200 of Hitler‚Äôs soldiers, including two field marshals and 10 generals, ‚Äúmen commanding up to 100,000 troops.‚Äù In about 20 cases, soldiers of Jewish heritage were awarded the Knight‚Äôs Cross, Germany‚Äôs highest military honor, he said.

This fall, Rigg, Yale ‚Äô96, arrived at England‚Äôs Cambridge University to begin a graduate degree in history, lugging his clothes, computer and documentation in a bulging knapsack. Jonathan Steinberg, a Cambridge historian, read Rigg‚Äôs files and hurried to find a safe place for them.

The scenario I'd posit is the one where NATO members independently move such ""peacekeeping"" troops into Western Ukraine, Lviv and Vinnytsia for sure, maybe as close to Kyiv as Zhytomir, and possibly to the Dnipro river, such places as Cherkasy and Kremenchuk. The boundaries could reach as far as the last major cities outside of Russian grasp, so Kryvyi Rih and Dnipro, maybe even across the river to Poltava.

The situation would be firmly one of no forwards movement and no aggressive actions - a boundary line for the maximum extent of permissible Russian control.

People have a preconceived notion of the justifiability of U.S. intervention to protect democracy + the ""liberal, rules-based order"" that has been propped up since WWII. However our geopolitical interests trump everything, and they always have. Sometimes our interests align with what's right--like Ukraine and WWII. But the list is not long.

We do support the liberal democracies of Europe, but we also partner with them to exploit the Global South. We've also ‚Äãsupported the majority of the world's right-wing dictatorships over the last 50 years. Overall, anything that threatens Western capital goes against our interests. China is currently the main enemy here.

First, it is incredibly difficult to hit an ICBM, and the appearance of MIRV warheads (or a missile that can carry multiple nukes) appearing in the 70s only complicated things more.  

More importantly, everyone figured out early on that one way to easily defeat these systems was to overwhelm them with nukes or just build more of the latter; in most cases, missile defense systems are actually more expensive than nukes.  Both the Soviet Union and the US realized that because of this, the anti-ballastic missile systems could actually result in an arms race where everyone tries to build more nukes to overwhelm the other side's counter measures.  Thus, some of the nuclear treaties ratified back during the Cold War put limits on the number of ABM systems to prevent that from happening.

Even then, that didn't stop Russia's nuke count from peaking at 45,000 back in 1986.  To put things into perspective, every country in the world today with nukes combined total only works out to be roughly a 1/3 of that.

US in Iraq or Vietnam, not genocide, etc. No excuse whatsoever for what‚Äôs going on in Ukraine today, and it could obviously lead to genocide, especially if it were allowed to escalate (as you seem keen on) but what‚Äôs happening now is not genocide, it‚Äôs classic war, with war crimes.

Edit: And btw the reason it matters is because there may be a duty to intervene under international law in cases of genocide, but not in cases of classic war, even with war crimes.",False,1646870022.0,t3_tags3o,t1_i01fjdt,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

It seems like the rise of humanitarianism is more a symptom of abundance and the resultant reality that it's easier for the United States to maintain power by satiating the public rather than oppressing it, to a greater degree than the historic precedent. I don't see society trending toward some kind of ideal egalitarianism, even though it seems like that's what people sometimes expect from those in power. I think that plenty of powerful people have good intentions, but plenty also don't, or at least have warped ideas about what must be done, and I think there's a tendency for powerful people to think that they have to play dirty now to gain enough power to improve the world later.

These kinds of conflicts brew out of fear and distrust, and often there's good precedent for not trusting each other. I'm not sure if there will ever be a solution to people's distrust of each other and the resultant occasional calamity. Even in a borderless, one world government, people would work against each other for fear of losing what is possible for others to take. 

Even if our brains were all networked together into a hive mind, sharing conscious experiences with no privacy, as one mind made up of individual intelligent, emotional minds, then intelligently processing each mind's experiences against each other into a conglomerate memory flow which is sent back to each individual mind would still result in worry that the others may alter or destroy your mind or restrict it's freedoms and agency.

It looks like the end game of humanity is either destruction, or a single surviving super-intelligence of some kind.

I would suppose that if the US never waged war, that it likely wouldn't exist right now, and that the game of geopolitics is to do whatever it takes to get on top and stay there. Will there ever come a time when global government can achieve lasting peace and prosperity, or is it part of the nature of society that, no matter the style of government or division of power systems, peoples will always have to be on guard to preserve their freedom and opportunity?

It is widely known for its use by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. In addition to its damaging environmental effects, traces of dioxin (mainly TCDD, the most toxic of its type) found in the mixture have caused major health problems for many individuals who were exposed, and their offspring.

Taiwain remains independent from China, Iran and Israel haven't lobbed any nukes, NK Korea has literally done nothing to effect Japan other than bolster support for the US military to keep their bases.

It is actual literal insanity for you to say ""someone is going to have to use the nuclear weapons they're bluffing with someday. In order to prevent that, we have to match every nuclear bluff with extreme military force. Unless we escalate into forcing nukes as the only option, our enemies might escalate into using nukes."" You can't believe that escalating a conflict will de-escalate that conflict. It's a contradiction in terms right from the outset. I understand you want to punish Russia as much as possible, but try to think logically. Nobody is just going to let Russia occupy Ukraine forever. Their economy is in freefall and Putin is getting visibly desperate. The plan is to force them to pull back their military in exchange for lifting some sanctions. If they don't pull back, they get fucked economically until they change their minds or get some new leadership in place. I know it's not as exciting as jumping headlong into WW3 but it's a plan based around getting as few people killed as possible.

Also, to be clear, Putin really, *really* wants NATO military forces to engage directly in Ukraine. It's literally his only way out as this point, which is why he's ratcheting up the brutality and threatening nukes and chemical weapons. His goal is to get angry, reactionary people like yourself to push NATO into engaging. The second NATO officially fires a bullet in this war, Putin's domestic support instantly hits 100% and stays there for at least a decade. With sufficient domestic support, Putin can ignore his economy getting fucked because literally the only thing that threatens him personally is a domestic uprising/coup. Without that domestic pressure, Putin can continue to do whatever the fuck he wants, including wars like this.

One thing that continues to give me pause though is all of the commentary on Russia's relative ""restraint"" in this invasion, particularly with respect to what Western military officials have called an ""unreasonable hesitation"" with using its air force.  That is, Russia has seemed so unwilling to put its air force at risk that it really defies rational explanation, *if* you assume that the most pressing and necessary goal for Russia was to establish air superiority over Ukraine for the purposes of this invasion. 

One worrying explanation is that this assumption is incorrect and that Russia still has much more significant medium-to-longterm goals in mind, ones that it anticipates will invite conflict for which they need all the air capabilities they can preserve.  

Now, this somewhat butts up against some of the intel coming out of the West about how this invasion was planned to be accomplished very quickly, intel which I don't doubt.  I think the stagnant super-convoy on the road to Kyiv is all the proof one needs to see that things are not going according to plan for Russia, and that certainly creates impetus for plans to change.  

But my point is that, *even if* the intel about this being a planned ""two-week"" invasion is correct, that doesn't necessarily rule out the idea that Russia's broader plan involved a much more slow-creeping conflict of attrition, one where they just continue to manufacture justifications for expanding....then de-escalating when necessary...then expanding again, and so on.

Calm down cowboy. No need to get caps lock happy at me.

Does Putin want to start a nuclear war? Doubtful. No one does. Yet in last 80ish years we have had atleast a half dozen incidents that were close to launch nukes at each other if not for one or two rational people. Eventually we won't get so lucky. 

In war things can escalate quickly and out of control. 

I am not saying we sacrifice 44 million people. I am saying we should try literally every single other option before we risk the other 8 billion people's lives. Sanctions are working, arms supplies to Ukraine are working, diplomatic pressure is working. 

We have a path forward that is working that has a low risk of nuclear. Why immediately jump to a different very dangerous path when the one we are currently on is working. It is like playing poker and slowly winning a bigger and bigger chip count then going all in blind.

NATO, US, EU, and most of world seems to agree with me. They have people vastly smarter than either of us doing the risk management of where the line is. I trust them more then some rando Reddit arm chair general.",False,1646860504.0,t3_tags3o,t1_i00qz80,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Yes, the state-run media has gotten even more locked down, but that's not something you do when everyone is cheering you on. More importantly, people don't give a shit about the media beyond believing what they wanted to believe already. They give a shit about buying nice things, paying rent, and in general having a functioning economy.

Emphasis mine. Why the rush? If even you are willing to acknowledge that the Russian military won't be able to face down NATO for a long time (I'd actually argue never, but we can go with ""not any time soon""), then there is no time pressure to do anything rash. Best to wait until Putin has dug himself a deeper pit with more atrocities (which build international support for NATO) and more economic failure (which weakens his domestic position *and* his ability to maintain his military).

*Especially* if you take the frankly insane stance that Putin has 100% committed to using nukes already, then it makes way more sense to wait until Putin drops one, *then* move in with NATO forces. Otherwise you're literally demanding the we send NATO troops into the target zone of a nuke that you are positive is coming.

Of course they weren't. 

The problem is that they are deployed now, and threats from Putin against the nuclear powers of NATO might (I argue) be enough to get them to stay home. The tangential point is that treaties, in and of themselves, don't do anything.

The broader point I'm trying to make - whether or not you agree, and I guess you don't - is that the US, UK, and France having nuclear weapons may not actually protect Estonia or Poland in the event that they are threatened.

Our support of several African nations has been critical in them developing well.

You're holding up a few public failures and condemning the entire system for it. We were not involved in Libya until the EU fucked it up and asked for our help. 

The Pentagon budget isn't that big %GDP wise, and the reason we spend so much so that if we do have to go anywhere, we don't look like the Russians do right now, which is a collection of idiots on a walkabout.

Education funding was tied to NCLB which has nothing to do with the Pentagon, but I can definitely see you're a product of its failures.

War kinda sucks, hot take I know.

Russia has interfered in our electoral process, that didn't lead to war.

Russia took out bounties on our soldiers, that didn't lead to war.

Russian and US forces fought in Syria, that too did not lead to war. We killed quite a few of them actually. We even told them we'd kill them.

It is not a binary choice, there are escalation steps, but not escalating at all means that we kowtow whenever a nuclear power wants something and people need help.
