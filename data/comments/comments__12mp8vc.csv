A US Patriot air defence system is expected to arrive in Ukraine sometime after Easter, Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat has said.

In the Orthodox Church, Easter is this weekend.

The public will know the new hardware has arrived ""as soon as the first Russian aircraft is shot down"", Mr Ihnat said on Ukrainian state TV.

A group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers completed their training at Oklahoma's Fort Still Army Post last month.

They then learned more about the missile system, which is used to track and shoot down enemy aircraft, when they arrived back in Europe.

A Patriot missile battery typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, power generator and an engagement control centre. 

Germany and the Netherlands have also pledged to provide a Patriot system each to Ukraine.

In addition, a SAMP/T anti-missile system pledged by France and Italy ""should enter Ukraine in the near future"", Mr Ihnat said this week.

My closest friend is Russian, and apparently is planning on going to Russia in 2 weeks.  He's going back for his grandma's funeral and to spread her ashes.  My suggestions that she won't mind waiting a few months/years has not been effective.  He's been very successful in tech, but went through a recent breakup which may or may not be impacting the decision.

My friend is military aged (38), a dual US/RU citizen, and has lived in the US since the mid 90s. He actually has about a decade of military experience from the US national gaurd.  He's a staff sargaent.  Basically, Russia couldn't ask for a better recruit.

In my eyes, its a bad idea for any male to go to Russia right now, given rumors of another draft and a bunch of news stories recently about Russia loosening rules (allowing draft via text, etc).  For someone who fairly obviously has military experience (he's in decent shape, military haircut, etc), it seems downright asinine.  It feels like there's a non-zero chance he gets drafted at the airport.

My friend says that because he doesn't have a permanent address in Russia, he can't be drafted.  That seems ridiculous to me, but I don't live in Russia so I'm looking for better information.

Is there anyone here who can share what his actual risks of being drafted are / how bad of an idea is this?  Or a forum where I could get objective answers?  Thank you!",1681601324.0,1681600435.0,t3_12mp8vc,t3_12mp8vc,,0,60,0,60,0,0,

The first Leopard tanks from Denmark should be ready to send to Ukraine ""very soon"", the country's acting defence minister has said. 

The Danish government partnered up with Germany and the Netherlands in February to donate at least 100 Leopard 1 tanks to Kyiv. 

Some of those tanks have been undergoing repairs at a military vehicle manufacturer in Flensburg, northern Germany. 

""It is a large and important donation to the Ukrainian freedom struggle,"" said Troels Lund Poulsen, during a visit to the factory. 

Germany has already sent at least 14 Leopard 2 tanks, with potentially dozens more to come.

Yet another example of Russia choosing optics and propaganda over actual military necessity. The Russian Pacific Fleet is a joke and since Turkey closed the Bosphorous to Russian warships the Pacific Fleet can't actually help the invasion in any meaningful way. Every ruble that goes to the Pacific Fleet at this point is money that Russia can't spend on actually fighting the war but apparently a ""show of force"" to Japan is more important. I also don't buy the argument that China will see Russia's Pacific Fleet and then suddenly decide to send Russia the heavy weapons they need for the war.

There is a common motif that dictators will do what is ""hard but necessary"" to achieve their goals and yet when I watch Russia, Putin regularly refuses to make hard choices. Instead he prioritizes propaganda and optics and indulges in fantasy and delusions because they seem nicer. Ukraine's decision to concede some territory to Russia early in the war and then target Russian supply lines was a hard choice but necessary for their survival. Russia's current choices of Pacific Fleet Propaganda over military pragmatism shows that Putin is either unwilling or unable to make the hard choices required to be a capable wartime leader.

Ukraine's planned spring counteroffensive is more likely to succeed than fail as Russia is in a state of ""crisis"", the head of the Russian mercenary Wagner group has said. 

Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been critical of Moscow's efforts in Ukraine for some time, has warned a ""deep state"" of selfish independent elites are at a crisis point due to the military's ""failures to secure a victory quickly"". 

He accused members of this specific community, which he defined as ""near-state elites that operate independently of the political leadership of the state and have close ties and their own agenda"", of sabotaging Russia's success to return to their privileged lifestyles. 

US think tank, The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), says Mr Prigozhin believes their ""internal enemies"" will push the Kremlin to make serious concessions, including returning territory to Ukraine over the course of a few years. 

""Prigozhin explicitly rejected the notion of any negotiations to end the war and urged Russians to continue fighting, even if it results in Russia’s temporary defeat,"" the ISW said. 

The mercenary leader has urged Russia to ignore the elite's temptations to cut losses and settle, saying the military cannot stop fighting now.

It comes at a time when intelligence agencies have reported a closer co-operation between Russian forces and Wagner fighters in recent days, particularly in the ongoing fight for Bakhmut.

> So, we keep control, although it is difficult, and the situation changes every hour, because someone, somewhere, feels something, we do not allow the bastards to gain a foothold in new positions, but it also affects us, there is no other way, that's all. 

> Therefore, there is no point in saying much about that news now. Yes, in the central part it is simply hell, where even Satan himself would be baptized in fire, but this situation will not get better, that's for sure.

I’m thinking specifically about “offensives”. We’re sitting here eagerly anticipating The Big Offensive tm. We’re picturing something like Norman Schwarzkopf's ""left hook"", like the Wehrmacht through belgium, D-Day, a massive spear thrust through the defensive lines.



But stuff like that requires a lot of planning. And you know what they say about plans. “No plan survives first contact with the enemy“. I wonder if Ukraine might want to take a more flexible approach. 



This war is different. The people fighting it are only just learning how to fight it. Drones, artillery that can hit within inches from 20 miles away, cameras, thermal sensors, satellites… but no airplanes? And now a whole hodge-podge of new equipment and capabilities is being added in to the mix. Nobody knows how a combined Leopard tank, commercial drone, special forces, Archer artillery, but no air-cover unit would perform because nobody has ever tried it.



A Big Offensive would be a big experiment, with a lot being risked on its outcome. I think that Ukraine might want to be more cautious with their new stuff. I think that it’s possible that we don’t get so much of a Big Offensive as much as we get Offensive Season, and that Ukraine starts taking whatever low-hanging fruit that they can find as they find it instead of going for big strategic red arrows on big table-top maps.

> My friend says that because he doesn't have a permanent address in Russia, he can't be drafted. That seems ridiculous to me, but I don't live in Russia so I'm looking for better information

Any moment you are in contact with Russian officials is an opportunity to be drafted. A prime recruiting tactic is to pick people up on small charges, inflate them and then give them a choice: long prison sentence or a ""short"" stint in the military. Airports are a great opportunity to force people to give up their social media accounts and go through them - and with how repressive the regime is now, basically any statement could be interpreted as ""anti-war"". And let's face it, they *absolutely* are going to be suspicious of *any* US citizen entering the country under these circumstance. 

Your friend additionally also falls into the prime category of people they would like to draft. Not even because he's ex-military, but because simply because he's a foreigner. The whole mobilization strategy is centered around keeping ethnic Russians from the Moscow/St. Petersburg area out of the army. He basically has no status in Russian society, and therefore will be seen as a prime candidate for mobilization.

No-one here can say what realistically the chances are that he'll get drafted or in any sort of trouble. But neither can he. Even if it's a small chance, that is a big fucking bet for the rest of your life. Imagine that out of every 100 times you'd step into a car, you'd end up in a car crash at least once. You wouldn't ever step into a car again with those odds.

> I wonder if Ukraine might want to take a more flexible approach.

Western forces are already structured in this way, where there is freedom for a brigade, company, or squad to use their own judgement and use flexibility in achieving their goals. This as opposed to e.g. Russian forces that are far more hierarchical, and have to go up the chain of command to get permission to deviate from the plan.  
Ukraine has been implementing this western philosophy for quite some time now, and we've seen this flexibility also on a bigger scale, e.g. when looking at the Kharkiv counteroffensive last autumn. 

> I think that it’s possible that we don’t get so much of a Big Offensive as much as we get Offensive Season, and that Ukraine starts taking whatever low-hanging fruit that they can find as they find it instead of going for big strategic red arrows on big table-top maps.

This is how all offensives work in practice. You start with shaping operations, you start poking and prodding, figuring out where the lines are weak, and only commit once you've found an opportunity. Again, i'd say, look at the Kherson/Kharkiv counteroffensive last autumn, where they pushed in multiple places, and once they found a weak spot in the Kharkiv area, committed more forces to exploit the breakthrough.

> When you’re good? You don’t need a plan. Plan on kicking ass. Put together big combined units that can kick Russian ass and then let them loose. They’ll figure out how.

Yeah.... no. This is where you go wrong. Plans should be dynamic, adaptable, and open to change when the opportunity arises. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't plan! You need multiple plans, including backup plans, and backup plans for those backup plans. But that is something entirely different from ""not having a plan"". Lets say you start your ""offensive season"" as you describe it, and unexpectedly manage to find a weak spot and exploit it, you need to know what to do next. should you grab the plan that exploits this breakthrough and encircles/flanks another part of the frontline? should you bunker down and fortify your gains before the enemy has a chance to respond? Should you take next bridge/town/obstacle while you can? Or does that mean you risk having unsecured supply lines? And where to commit your reserves if you have multiple breakthroughs?

This current defensive war is slowly draining Russia’s military. The man power Russia are throwing at Bakmut now do not seem to be expendable. This certainly works in Ukraine’s favour.

I think the delay is also extremely damaging for Russia politically. Sitting and waiting for Ukraine to launch its offensive does not make Russia look strong.

The current electronic draft that has apparently been initiated in response to the anticipated Ukrainian offensive is a political disaster for Putin. This kind of nationwide drafting is exactly the kind of thing that makes him look desperate in Russia.

I also agree that Ukraine has no reason right now to hurry. I’m not sure Russia has much of a defensive plan right now. 

While it’s true that no one has implemented an offensive like this in 80 years, and the real effects of new technologies is essentially unknown in an operation this size, it is also true no one knows how to defend against this type of attack.

Imagination is not Russias strong point. We know what  Russias defensive will be. It will be have they usually do. Mines, arty, and Trenches. The only possible exception is they might be willing to sacrifice their jets more an usual.

While it might be political conventional wisdom to try to take back your land as soon as possible, I think the Ukrainian generals will be seeing things very differently. In fact, they might be thinking exactly what you are.

U.S. citizens residing or travelling in Russia should depart Russia immediately. Exercise increased caution due to wrongful detentions. ... In September, the Russian government mobilized citizens to the armed forces in support of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia may refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, deny their access to U.S. consular assistance, subject them to mobilization, prevent their departure from Russia, and/or conscript them.

And that's a very irresponsible thing to say and shows a complete misunderstanding about what kind of state Russia is.

Russian leadership's constant desire for expansion is a fact, which is prevalent for more than 500 years. So if Russia isn't weakened, it will continue to pursue this policy after the end of this war again, and we'd be talking about new wars in Northeastern Europe (Ukraine, Baltics, Moldova, Poland, Finland) in a decade or so.

If Russia (and the image of its leadership) is actually weakened, it might collapse like a house of cards, as there are a lot of ethnic republics which share barely anything with Moscow and its governors, and do not benefit much from a centralised governance in Russia. There also might be a chance for democracy and peaceful partnership with newly established states, as they would try to naturally distance themselves from a centralised government in Moscow.

So I'd say Macron's ideas about Russia being equivalent to post-WW1 Germany are completely wrong. Germany was a humiliated, relatively wealthy, mono-ethnic unitary state in the age of empires, while Russia is a 19th to early 20th-century dinosaur in a 21st-century world, which is getting by selling its natural resources and terrorising almost all its neighbours (and its own federal subjects as well).",1681570494.0,1681570028.0,t3_12mp8vc,t1_jgc6bgw,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
