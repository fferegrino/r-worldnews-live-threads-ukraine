Day 66 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Around 3 AM there was a sudden big fire from shelling in the Northern Saltivka district, and it illuminated a big part of the sky. In the morning we saw what was burning and it turned out to be a 16 story apartment building, it literally just folded down the middle.

I don’t think that was normal shelling, it wasn’t confirmed, but from what we saw it had to be a big missile like Kalibr, as the whole building was completely destroyed. The good news is that it looks like it was empty, as most of the district is already a ghost town, there’s not a single undamaged building in the Northern Saltivka area, so they just wasted an expensive missile for nothing.

Today shelling wasn’t as bad and it happened during the day instead of the usual time. After the shelling stopped, news appeared about the liberation of 3 more settlements near Kharkiv, so what we were hearing most likely came from there. Right now we only hear our own artillery shooting at something.

And about how we can differentiate between incoming shelling and our own artillery, there are some subtle differences that we only started noticing after around a month of living under constant shelling. 

First difference is that when our artillery shoots we don’t just hear an explosion, we can actually hear the sound of recoil, as in the sound of moving metal parts right after the shot, and after it shoots we hear the shell fly through the air for a couple of seconds until it gets too far from us to hear it, most of the time we don’t actually hear where the shell lands.

The second difference is in the shockwaves, when there are explosions nearby, you can feel it because the building itself starts to shake, and windows almost break from the pressure, but when your own artillery fires nearby the most you feel is slight air pressure on the windows, despite the fact that the sound it makes when firing is still incredibly loud and can be easily mistaken for incoming shelling. 

And the third difference is that the sound of the explosion is very different. A shot from something like a howitzer sounds like a normal explosion, but when a shell lands it sounds exactly like thunderclap. Seriously, if you ever heard thunder, it means you know what incoming shelling sounds like. Now we will forever associate thunder with war.

Again I really appreciate all the support we’ve been getting, and I’m extremely thankful for it, it helps us immensely. Though it still feels very strange that complete strangers worry about us more than our own friends and relatives that live in Russia, the level of brainwashing they are under is just unreal, it feels like they can’t even process that there’s a war going on and we are in the middle of it.

From CNN's Michael Conte and Oren Liebermann

The US has begun additional training for Ukrainian armed forces at US military installations in Germany, the Defense Department announced. 

“These efforts build on the initial artillery training that Ukraine’s forces already have received elsewhere, and also includes training on the radar systems and armored vehicles that have been recently announced as part of security assistance packages,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a news briefing with reporters.

Kirby said that Germany is one of “roughly three” sites being used by the US to train Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, but would not disclose the others.

He also said “the bulk of the training” will be conducted by the Florida National Guard who had been training Ukrainians before being repositioned out of Ukraine in February prior to the Russian invasion.

“The recent reunion now of these Florida National Guard members with their Ukrainian colleagues, we are told, was an emotional meeting, given the strong bonds that were formed as they were living and working together before temporarily parting ways in February,” Kirby said.

Meanwhile, a senior US defense official said Friday that ""more than a dozen flights” carrying military assistance for Ukraine from the US are expected to arrive in the European region for transport into Ukraine “in the next 24 hours.""

Those flights will include shipments of “Howitzers, more 155 rounds, some of those Phoenix Ghost UAVs and even some of the radars that we talked about,” the official said.

This security assistance is all coming from US President Joe Biden’s latest presidential drawdown authority package, the official added, saying that 155 artillery rounds “continue to flow into Ukraine even over the last 24 hours.""

Two evacuation buses have gone missing - military official

Two buses sent to rescue civilians from a Ukrainian town under heavy attack by Russian forces are reported to have gone missing.

A military official from Popasna, in the Donbas region, said one of the two buses, driven by volunteers, had come under fire inside the small town.

Mikola Khanatov said there was no news about the second vehicle - a school bus driven by a local history teacher.

One of the volunteers, Galina Kroshka, said three buses had been sent to Popasna on Friday to help with the evacuation of hundreds of civilians.

Two buses failed to return to the town of Bakhmut. Earlier in the day 31 civilians had been brought to safety.

“We’re very worried. Our buses didn’t come back, and we’ve had no contact with them since yesterday. We can’t go to Popasna ourselves until the situation is clearer,” said Galina, who, with her husband, has been ferrying civilians, and humanitarian aid, between the towns for several weeks.

Ukrainian commander inside Mariupol steel plant says evacuations of civilians have begun
From CNN's Julia Kesaieva and Tim Lister

Some civilians have been evacuated from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol after a ceasefire was introduced, according to a commander in the Azov Regiment, one of the Ukrainian soldiers trapped at the plant.

Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, said the ceasefire, which was supposed to begin at 6 a.m. local time, ended up starting at 11 a.m. local time.

""As of now, it's the truth, both sides follow the ceasefire regime,"" he said.

The evacuation convoy was very delayed, he said. ""Since 6 a.m., we've been waiting for the evacuation convoy to arrive, which only arrived at 6:25 p.m.""

""We have brought 20 civilians to the agreed meeting point, whom we've managed to rescue from under the rubble. These are women and children. We hope these people will go the agreed destination, which is Zaporizhzhia, the territory controlled by Ukraine,"" Palamar said.

""As of now, the rescue operation is ongoing, conducted by the servicemen of Azov - we rescue the civilians from under the rubble,"" he added.

""These are women, children and the elderly,"" he said in a video message on the regiment's Telegram channel.

""We hope that this process will be further extended and we will successfully evacuate all civilians,"" he said.

""As for the wounded — those people who require urgent medical care — it is unclear to us why they are not being evacuated and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,"" he added.
""I emphasize that we ask to guarantee the evacuation not just for civilians but also for our wounded servicemen who require medical care.""
TASS, Russia's state news agency, said earlier Saturday that a group of civilians left the steel plant. A correspondent on the scene told TASS that a total of 25 people came out, including six children under the age of 14. CNN cannot independently verify the TASS reporting.

There are thought to be hundreds of people inside the steel complex, including dozens injured during an intense Russian bombardment over the past several weeks. The latest satellite images of the plant show that many of its buildings have been reduced to ruins.

The defenders of the Azovstal plant said that attacks on Wednesday night had hit the makeshift hospital inside the complex, greatly adding to the number of injured.

**The Zelenskyy effect: Why Ukraine’s “Ze” is defeating Russia’s “Z”**

*Rarely has a politician so visibly surprised so many. The man Ukrainians call “Ze” has come to symbolize his nation’s fierce resistance to what many experts initially thought was a Russian military juggernaut. Following his lead, tens of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians have joined the all-volunteer Territorial Defense Force and one poll found 39 per cent of adult citizens are actively volunteering to support the war effort more broadly. Farmers have used their tractors to “reclaim” military hardware. Every day, protests occur in towns and cities under temporary occupation. And across the country, elderly villagers try to stop tanks with their bare hands.*  
  
*Yet this full-on Ukrainian mobilization, and Zelenskyy’s potential to rally it, should have been no surprise. The reason for its success is not that Zelenskyy’s special leadership traits set him apart from his country. Instead, what is making him extraordinary in war comes from his very ordinariness as a Ukrainian. As such, he inherits a tradition of dissent and a fierce civic sense that is baked into the country’s identity. He is a Ukrainian everyperson, albeit in a way few others could be.*

“We are actively demining the liberated territory. Every day several dozen settlements are added to the list of those where demining has been completed,” he said.

Zelensky also said officials are “doing everything” to restore roads and access to medical, educational and financial services.

Pootin does not have limited objectives. If he could, he would take the whole of Ukraine and subjugate or completely annex it. No matter how long it takes or how many lives are lost.

After that, presumably, he'd hope the West would give up or slow down on following sanctions due to Ukraine being a lost cause, like Crimea.

This failed for a variety of reasons.  Practically minutes after Putin declared war, it was reported that Russian saboteurs were attempting to take over Kyiv's airport, which would allow Russian troops to basically fly in to Kyiv unopposed and take the capital with little resistance. This failed, and the rest of the nearby airports were either purposefully or unintentionally destroyed, as places like Hostomel Airport were destroyed from constant fighting. Plus, even if the Russian were to land, they would likely get immediately hit by Ukrainians running on US fed intel.

The second reason, which is related to the first, was in the skies. It was also presumed by many that Russia would immediately take air supremacy, as they did in Syria, allowing Russian fighters and bombers to do whatever they liked. This also failed, as Ukraine was able to shoot down several fighter jets, either with jets of their own or by hitting them with AA. It's also reported that the infamous VDV paratroopers were mercilessly killed, either by getting shot upon touching down or the aircraft containing them getting blown up.

The third reasons was Russian supply lines. Although Russia might have some fancy equipment at military parades and a good reputation from fucking up Nazi Germany in a defensive war, it has become clear that Russia hasn't really learned any lessons on how to mount an offensive war since the Winter War, in which they massively underperformed. You would see some monty python shit on the streets, Russian tanks and vehicles breaking down and stuck on civilian highways. Russian vehicles are literally unable to go more than a dozen miles or so from their bases without running out of gas or breaking down. In an offensive war, that's completely disastrous.

All of this has combined to place Putin in a war that is more or less unwinnable, at least without a draft, which has the potential to cause chaos domestically. The Ukrainian army has been able to fully mobilize, set up defensive lines, and hunker down in cities, effectively turning them into giant tank land mines with buildings providing great cover for NLAWS and Javelins. Foreign military aid is flooding in, as militaries across the world give hand-me downs of their old NATO equipment that is still miles better than the Ukrainians, and Russians, Soviet era equipment.  But now, with even better equipment such as Howitzers, Bushmasters, and a  Lend Lease act pending, Ukraine is about to get some truly world class equipment. This could potentially allow Ukraine to break through the existing separatist/ newly made Russian defensive lines, and allow for a decisive Ukrainian victory. There was a report from a top British official that this is now the goal, to destroy Putin's ability to wage war right here, right now, in Ukraine while their hands are tied.",False,1651359535.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,56,0,56,0,0,

Despite these losses, Russian troops still have equipment to launch additional attacks, Zelensky said.

 ""Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory,"" he added. ""But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow.""

Russia plans to hold its traditional Victory Day parade in Red Square May 9, commemorating the German surrender to the Soviet Union in the Second World War.

The Ukrainian President also said Russia has already lost more than 23,000 soldiers since the invasion began. CNN cannot independently verify this claim. 

Russia has sporadically released casualty figures that are low and which observers deem to be a massive underestimate. Two days prior to Russia’s update, two senior NATO military officials estimated the number of Russian soldiers killed in action in Ukraine to be between 7,000 and 15,000. Around the same time, other US officials had put Russian losses in a similar range -- between 7,000 and 14,000 Russian soldiers killed -- but they have expressed “low confidence” in those estimates.

Earlier in the month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov briefly admitted Russia had suffered “significant” losses of its troops in Ukraine, calling the losses “a huge tragedy” for the country in an interview with Sky News.

On the southern borders of Ukraine's defense, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the enemy electronic warfare station ""Repellent-1"", 3 anti-aircraft guns, anti-aircraft missile system ""Arrow-10"", as well as a communications vehicle and 42 invaders.

Source : OK ""South""

Literally : ""On the Nikolaev-Kherson direction fighting continues. The enemy having no activity in advance, has fixed on positions and continues artillery and mortar attacks.

At new attempts of reconnaissance of a situation by drones, the enemy lost 2 more ""Eagles-10"" in the Nikolaev area. The strikes of our units were devastating.

In the Kherson region, our soldiers destroyed the enemy electronic warfare station ""Repellent-1"" with artillery fire.

Another attack on enemy targets on Zmiiny smashed 3 anti-aircraft guns, the Strela-10 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as a communication vehicle - a server with telecommunications equipment. ""

Details : In addition, OK ""South"" reports the destruction of 42 Russian invaders.

A missile strike was fired on Odessa again . This time, 3 Onyx missiles were launched from the occupied territory of Crimea by the Bastion missile system, which hit the runway. The destruction led to the impossibility of further operation of the runway. There are no victims.

On the eve of May 2, the campaign to shake up Odessa, border regions and attempts to incite pro-Russian forces continues.

Thus, information about the sabotage was obtained promptly - the circulation of the newspaper ""Transnistria"" from May 2, 2022 with the alleged official appeal of the people of Transnistria to Putin for protection from the attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

""Disclosure of this provocation discredited the actions of enemy forces,"" the OK South said in a statement.

The enemy's naval group continues to blockade navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea and threatens to launch missile strikes throughout Ukraine.""

**Sanction the Right People in Russia**

*Sanctions have affected Russian politicians and propagandists — but not ideologues.*

*But I would say that Western sanctions seem to be missing much more important targets. People like Solovyov, Skabeyeva, and Sheinin are brainless clowns who may voice some thoughts by no means produced by them.* 

*But those who created the modern Russian ideology and actively disseminated it for years remain untouched. As Mr. Putin now rejects the fundamental rules of the current international order, I should remind readers who first proposed the vision of “a world without rules” that will appear if Russian interests are neglected: Sergei Karaganov, Fyodor Lukyanov, Timofei Bordachev and their colleagues at the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy and Valdai Discussion Club.* 

*Dr. Karaganov frantically defended Russia’s right to reshape post-Soviet borders; argued that NATO is a “political cancer” that aims to kill the “healthy” Russian state; that Ukraine has no right to be a sovereign state, etc. This trio, together with Dmitry Suslov, Andrei Ilnitsky, Andrei Sushentsov and some others have for years glorified Russia's “pivot to the East,” claiming that Moscow’s alliance with Beijing would end American supremacy.*

Here’s some highlights:

>	If these Ukrainian claims are at all accurate (it should be noted that documented, photographed claims of Russian losses are about two thirds of those claimed, so they certainly should not be out by much) then the Russians have lost 217 tanks and 404 APCs since the battle started

>	Even if they are exaggerrated by 20 percent, Russian losses would be extreme, around 20 full strength BTGs worth? And according to the Pentagon, the Russians have 92 BTGs in Ukraine.

>	That means they could have lost 20% of their tanks and APCs in Ukraine since the battle started (thats if the BTGs were at that point close to full strength. If they were considerably weaker, it could be higher).

…

>	And now some worrying signs are creeping in for the Russians. 1st, there are indications that the Ukrainians are starting to deploy the loitering munition UAVs (Switchblade type) that were sent just a little while ago. This could be a major Russian problem

…

>	Another worrying sign for the Russians are growing reports (and pictures) of accurate, long range artillery fire by the Ukrainians. Considering Ukr artillery capabilities should grow over the coming weeks, this will add to Russian losses.

From CNN'S Teele Rebane in Hong Kong

Shelling has hit a village in the Russian region of Bryansk, which borders Ukraine, causing damage but no casualties, according to a local official. 

Governor Alexander Bogomaz said in a statement that the village of Zhecha came under fire as air defense systems intercepted a Ukrainian aircraft entering Russian territory.

The blast wave from the incident damaged the casing of “technological buildings of the oil terminal” and the surrounding area, Bogomaz said, adding that no one was hurt.

The Ukrainian Armed Forces have not commented on the incident.

The governor's announcement comes a day after he said the border department of the Federal Security Service (FSB) reported another incident of shelling in the nearby village of Belaya Berezka, allegedly carried out from Ukrainian territory.

“On April 29, a branch of the border department of the FSB of Russia in the Bryansk region in the village of Belaya Berezka, Trubchevsky district, was subjected to mortar fire from the territory of Ukraine,” Bogomaz said Friday in a post on his official channel on messaging app Telegram. He said there were no casualties.

Source : General Staff of the Armed Forces

Details : These are units from the Eastern Military District.

In the Slobozhansky direction , the enemy is concentrating its main efforts on holding positions and striking at the Armed Forces.

The enemy inflicts air and missile strikes and fires on artillery targets in the depths of Ukraine, the positions of our troops along the line of contact and in border areas. Regrouping and strengthening of Russian troops continues.

In the Volyn and Polissya directions , the enemy did not take active action, without changes.

In the northern direction, the Russians fired on the positions of Ukrainian troops in the settlements of Kindrativka, Katerynivka, Svarkove and Bilokopytove.

Russian units tried to launch an offensive in the direction of Sulyhivka and Dovhenky, but were unsuccessful. To cover the groups of its troops in the Kharkiv and Izyum directions , the enemy is trying to deploy air defense forces and means.

In the Eastern Operational Zone, the enemy continues to advance on the Lyman (in the areas of Yampil, Ozerne, Lyman), Severodonetsk , where it is trying to complete the capture of Rubizhne, Popasnyansky (in the direction of Kalinovo and Popasna) and Kurakhiv (Olenivka and Novomykhailivka) . There is no success, the fighting continues.

Artillery shelling of units of our troops does not stop in the Zaporizhia direction .

There was no active enemy offensive in the South Bug direction . there are isolated shellings of our positions.

In the Bessarabian direction without significant changes.

On the Nikolaev direction the enemy intensified air reconnaissance in operational depth of defensive positions of ZSU, probably, for exposure of existence and character of actions of reserves.

The Armed Forces hit 10 air targets: one plane and nine Orlan-10 operational-tactical UAVs.

14 enemy attacks were repulsed in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Eleven tanks, seven artillery systems, twenty-eight armored vehicles and fourteen vehicles were destroyed.""

**Why Russians Swallow Propaganda**

*Even independent sociological centers record no change in the Russian majority’s support for the so-called “special operation”. Even considering that the data cannot be completely reliable under repressive conditions, sociologists paint a rather bleak picture, in which the majority of the population is in favor of the war, at least passively.*  
  
*This situation persists even though the goals of the so-called “special operation” are only vaguely understood by the population, and the authorities contradict themselves, trying to explain what exactly they want to achieve. Thus, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the goal of the war unleashed by the Kremlin was to “end the US course of dominating the world,” while Vladimir Putin again returned to the mantras about “helping the people of Donbas.”*  
  
*To understand what makes Russians believe in absolutely irrational and illogical ideas, it is important to recall the most common psychological defense mechanisms that the Russian population has been resorting to for many years.*

Just so everyone is aware of her extensive background in human rights advocacy - since it seems everyone thinks this is a PR stunt:

• Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia. Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world.

• To address crisis of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal. She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.

• Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.

• Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.

• She became noted for traveling to war zones, such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict, the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War, where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces, and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.

• To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world; she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.

• Traveled to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.

• In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. This helped end poaching and remove left over mines from the landscape.

• In 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie.

• In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.

• Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.”

• Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.

• Jolie advocates for an end to child marriage, for children's education. Since 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions. In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups. Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.

• Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit; she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.

• Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan.

• In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.

• In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.

• In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, to treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.

• Jolie is executive producer of the BBC program My World which aims to teach teenagers how to think critically about what they read and how to tell high-quality journalism from bad.

• In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries. Its member attorneys have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.

• Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency.

• In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague. Jolie spoke on the subject at the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date.

• In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject,which resulted in a protocol endorsed by 151 nations.

• On September 9, 2020, Jolie made a generous donation to two young boys, who were running a lemonade stand in London. The boys were raising money through the stall for the people of Yemen, as the country was on the brink of humanitarian crisis caused by the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels.",1651353358.0,1651353263.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

People rightly pointed out there would be considerable resistance within the Russian population, which is why Putin hasn't tried it yet. However, it's a gamble he'll likely see as necessary soon.  
For Putin, giving up and withdrawing is not an option for both personal survival and nationalistic reasons. Historically, autocrats who embark on wars of choice and fail have a very low survival rate. Thus, For him, admitting defeat is tantamount to suicide. At the same time, he now finds himself in an all out war of attrition against a country supplied by countries making up half the world's economy. Ukraine now stands to not only destroy the Russian invasion, but recover at least some of its territory lost in 2014.   
As long as the West remains committed, it's an utterly hopeless fight for Russia. Using WMDs would likely draw in the West directly with catastrophic results for everyone. That leaves only one way out - draw out the war as long as possible and hope the West loses the will to continue. The only possible way to achieve this is to commit Russia in its entirety to the war. Now, this may result in a wholesale rebellion by Russian society, but the alternative - sure military defeat and his likely resultant overthrow - is likely worse in his mind.

Russia's ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov has rejected Pentagon spokesman John Kirby's accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin acted with ""depravity"" in his invasion of Ukraine.  
  
Yesterday, Kirby became visibly emotional as he asked how anyone ""moral"" could justify the atrocities committed by Russia.  
  
But in a social media post, Mr Antonov described Kirby's statement as ""offensive and unacceptable"".  
  
""It has become a norm here that administration officials base their judgments on dirty lies of the Ukrainian authorities,"" Mr Antonov said.  
  
The Russian ambassador added that the US did not want hostilities in Ukraine to end.

Khrushchev's great-granddaughter says world closer to nuclear war than during Cuban missile crisis

Russia and the west are nearer to nuclear war than during the Cuban missile crisis, the great-granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev has warned.

Nina Khrushcheva, an academic whose great-grandfather was leader of the Soviet Union during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, warned the war in Ukraine appears to be more dangerous as neither side seems willing to “back off”.

Khrushcheva said that both US president John F Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to de-escalate as soon as nuclear war became a real threat.

Speaking on the Today programme, Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in New York, said of the 1962 crisis:

What really saved the world at the time was that both Khrushchev and Kennedy, whatever they thought of each other’s ideology and disagreed with it, and didn’t want to give in and blink first, yet when the threat appeared of a potential conflict of any kind they immediately backed off.

We are closer to more issues, nuclear, than any other way, because I don’t see today any side, particularly the Russian side, backing off, and that’s what really scares me the most.”

Khrushcheva also claimed that Russia’s war in Ukraine was “a proxy war” between the west and Russia in which Ukraine is “to some degree a pawn”.

While former MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger seconded her concerns about the threat of nuclear war, he rejected her view of the conflict as a “proxy war”. He said:

The idea that this is a broader war, that we’re in a broader conflict with Russia, simply plays to the Russian narrative as they come under pressure because they’ll be able to tell their people that this is a defensive war.”",False,1651322554.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,-3,0,-3,0,0,

People's stuff has more energy in it than the Russians could realistically put into a bomb.  In Western USA fire fighters will sometimes drive around with bulldozers leveling people's houses.  It becomes a tense situation because the houses are not on fire yet.  The fuel (house and things) then gets lit on fire and burned.  The small low fires are less likely to jump the fire break.  Home owners just see that someone knocked over the house and lit it on fire but the houses across the street were not hit by the firestorm.  The motive was to save the houses in the next block and all the ones beyond it but that is not always easy to accept. 

In WWII the Air Force used a combination of one large bomb blast and a swarm of little incendiary devices.  The big blast would break open doors and shatter windows.  The incendiaries were a burning metal which, I believe, is the same as ""4th of July sparklers"" that we burn on holidays.  The bomb version was more the size of a brick so that it could punch through a wood roof.   Because of the open windows the small fires could grow into a large one.  In the west German cities that were bombed frequently people kept a bucket of sand and a shovel so they could use the sand to smother the fire and they scooped in incendiary into the bucket.  People in Dresden did not have fire drills.  Small fires can grow and merge into something much larger.

Germany attacked the Soviet Union.  The USSR included Ukraine and Lithuania. 

The USSR won the war.  Or at least Soviet tanks rolled in to what was left of Berlin.  I have seen figures like 4 million Soviet soldiers killed or captured in the first summer.  The Soviet opening was not tactical masterpiece that anyone would ever repeat.  

No one is sending ""old NATO equipment"" (though I am not informed of details)  Countries that were in Warsaw Pact but are now in NATO were sending old Soviet/Warsaw Pact ammunition and equipment.  Ukraine's army used Warsaw pact standards so it is easier to integrate.  Ukraine is now getting new NATO stuff or whatever is/was on hand.  

""Howitzer"" is a more general term than how you are using it.  Modern artillery is a mortar, a howitzer, or a gun.  Ukraine had hundreds of 152mm howitzers at war start.  The NATO standard is 155mm.  So Ukraine could not fire NATO ammunition.  Someone will get all pissy and insists that howitzers are not the same as howitzers.  You hear the same thing with M16s and AK47s they are not identical. People can rant for hours about the merits and demerits but bottom line both are clearly ""infantry assault rifles"".  Assault rifles are a type of gun.

that being said.. this could in theory be possible if the plant had a complete lapse of infrastructure security. 

To keep it simple, industrial complexes like these can use SCADA/ICS systems(industrial control systems). These are embedded or SoC type setups that are dumb devices that basically can control valves, or measure flows of electricity, gas, etc. 

Now on a VERY BASIC level of security the first and most important thing of a SCADA/ICS is that its Air gapped(isolated from public WAN). Meaning that the outside internet could never reach this network. Now beyond that the security gets more lax as the devices are rarely patched because they come from proprietary vendors, and usually the network traffic isnt monitored because well.. its air gapped. 

So in theory if this plant was a complete dunce and published(exposed) their ICS to the public WAN or ran it off a unsecure and unencrypted WIFI, a malicious entity could overload the valve, or give false data readings, etc. 

Most times when the complete lapse of security is present on these networks all the dumb devices become IoT botnets.",False,1651332541.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6soahv,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,uf35hi,i6syxhw,"Well, quite frankly, Putin had a lot of reasons to think that. Mostly the weak EU/US reaction to his excursions in Georgia and Crimea in 2008 and 2014. Additionally, Putin believed he would run over Ukraine in a matter of weeks, which would present a ""fait accompli"" that the West would have no choice but to accept. Additionally, he thought that the divisions in the west could be exploited to prevent the heaviest of sanctions from coming through. Then, in a few years as things would normalize the worst sanctions would be removed and all would be ""well"". 

However, there were three factors that he completely misjudged that brought him to this error. First is the successful Ukrainian military defense. This prevented the ""fait accompli"" and gave the West needed time to formulate a strategy and execute a response. Secondly, the role of social media that showed the enormous suffering happening on the ground, which allowed western audiences to relate directly to the Ukranians. Ukrainian people were sharing their stories everywhere in good spoken English, and people sympathized creating a groundswell of support and pressure on EU politicians. And lastly, the stellar performance of Zelenskyy and his team, which performed great PR and diplomacy, further adding to domestic support in EU countries for sanctions and actions, allowing them to extract the maximum possible concessions out of the EU/US.

Because of these things, the EU suddenly was given the time and the ability to form a unified response. If Ukraine had been overrun, or had its leadership failed, there would have been division (""Why incur huge economic damage if it's already too late for Ukraine"") that Russia could have then exploited further. 

The brutality and war crimes of the Russian military has only served to stiffen the resolve after that. Again, those war crimes would likely not have happened without strong Ukrainian resistance, or at least to a much lesser degree.

So all in all, it was not entirely unreasonable for Putin to think he would get away with it, based on the information he had at the time. Clearly his information was *wrong*, and therefore his calculation also. But ultimately, his actions were ""rational"", in the sense that they were logically structured to achieve his desired outcome, it's just that their factual foundations were not sound.

Edit: I do think some additional credit belongs here to Biden and his team. They have been ahead on the Russian's at every step and started to build a coalition against Russia months before the actual invasion. US sharing of highly classified intelligence as well as putting pressure on the EU absolutely helped as well. Likely Biden was underestimated by Putin as well, and the US appetite for sanctions and foreign intervention (after the Afghanistan debacle) was estimated to be lower than it came out in reality.",1651337654.0,1651335655.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6swthn,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

Then you are not bad people, you are just better at it. because you're better at it, you in fact are superior, better people and even good. 

One apparent fact that isn't being mentioned here is the reports that the Russian government had paid out huge sums for bribes and thought they had bought a show of capitulation and immediate surrender from the local governors and mayors in the oblasts and cities. 

The story that the Ukrainians would accept the Russians with open arms as saviors would have had PR materials to back it up, and after that, who's to say what the real truth was? 

It was a good plan, if you leave morality out of the equation, but it backfired because it relied on corruption to succeed. What happened, apparently, is that the middlemen in charge of dispensing the bribes stole all the money! The Russians only seem to have successfully bought one city government, Kherson. 

Thieves-in-law follow the law of thieves. Because Putin's government was corrupt he assumed everyone in Ukraine was just as corrupt (error number 1) and his plan relied on extremely corrupt accomplices that were not in-country (and hence less controllable) who turned out to be even better at corruption than they were (error number 2). 

It sort of makes a beautiful, horrible sense in the end.

I totally agree, and few seem to grasp, this is all about Putin's survival.  I am not sure he's not willing to kill us all if it appears his safety is compromised.

Though this would in reality be a failure, control of the media and an underlying popular anxiety about a possible draft and or nuclear war would make it domestically sellable.

\- **2** Waiting for the West to crack in reality boils down to the US cracking. Realistically that requires a new President to be in post, which means enduring 2 years and 7 months of having the country's armed forces wrecked just for a throw of the dice.

(While I would never attempt to diagnose anyone I have not personally seen) I would reserve my judgement on any Parkinson's until there are more signs, especially if language/handwriting begins to be impacted. 

Please take anything ANYONE says on the internet with a grain of salt, but I am a neuropsychologist in training and have completed many pre/post testing on Parkinson's patients for DBS surgery.

• Jolie first witnessed the effects of a humanitarian crisis while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) in war-torn Cambodia. Jolie contacted the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for information on international trouble spots. To learn more about the conditions in these areas, she began visiting refugee camps around the world.

• To address crisis of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, she donated $1 million in response to an international UNHCR emergency appeal. She covered all costs related to her missions and shared the same rudimentary working and living conditions as UNHCR field staff on all of her visits.

• Jolie was named a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador at UNHCR headquarters in Geneva on August 27, 2001.

• Over the next decade, she went on more than 40 field missions, meeting with refugees and internally displaced persons in over 30 countries.

• She became noted for traveling to war zones, such as Sudan's Darfur region during the Darfur conflict, the Syrian-Iraqi border during the Second Gulf War, where she met privately with U.S. troops and other multi-national forces, and the Afghan capital Kabul during the war in Afghanistan, where three aid workers were murdered in the midst of her first visit.

• To aid her travels, she began taking flying lessons in 2004 with the aim of ferrying aid workers and food supplies around the world; she now holds a private pilot license with instrument rating and owns a Cirrus SR22 and Cessna 208 Caravan single-engine aircraft.

• Traveled to Ecuador, where she met with Colombian refugees, and she accompanied Guterres on a week-long tour of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq, to assess the situation of refugees from neighboring Syria.

• In an effort to connect her Cambodian-born adopted son with his heritage, Jolie purchased the park's 60,000 hectares and turned the area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. This helped end poaching and remove left over mines from the landscape.

• In 2006, Jolie expanded the scope of the project to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals.By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie.

• In name of their Namibian-born daughter, they have funded large-animal conservation projects as well as a free health clinic, housing, and a school for the San Bushmen community at Naankuse.

• Jolie has pushed for legislation to aid child immigrants and other vulnerable children in both the U.S. and developing nations, including the ""Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2005.”

• Since October 2008, she has co-chaired Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a network of leading U.S. law firms that provide free legal aid to unaccompanied minors in immigration proceedings across the U.S.

• Jolie advocates for an end to child marriage, for children's education. Since 2007, she has co-chaired the Education Partnership for Children of Conflict, which provides policy and funding to education programs for children in conflict-affected regions. In its first year, the partnership supported education projects for Iraqi refugee children, youth affected by the Darfur conflict, and girls in rural Afghanistan, among other affected groups. Since April 2013, all proceeds from Jolie's high-end jewelry collection, Style of Jolie, have benefited the partnership's work.

• Jolie additionally launched the Malala Fund, a grant system established by Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai, at the 2013 Women in the World Summit; she personally contributed over $200,000 to the cause.

• Jolie has funded a school and boarding facility for girls at Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, and two primary schools for girls in the returnee settlements Tangi and Qalai Gudar in eastern Afghanistan.

• In addition to the facilities at the Millennium Village she established in Cambodia, Jolie had built at least ten other schools in the country by 2005.

• In February 2006, she opened the Maddox Chivan Children's Center, a medical and educational facility for children affected by HIV, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh.

• In Sebeta, Ethiopia, the birthplace of her eldest daughter, she funds a sister facility, the Zahara Children's Center, to treat and educate children suffering from HIV or tuberculosis. Both centers are run by the Global Health Committee.

• Jolie is executive producer of the BBC program My World which aims to teach teenagers how to think critically about what they read and how to tell high-quality journalism from bad.

• In January 2011, she established the Jolie Legal Fellowship, a network of lawyers and attorneys who are sponsored to advocate the development of human rights in their countries. Its member attorneys have facilitated child protection efforts in Haiti in the wake of the 2010 earthquake and promoted the development of an inclusive democratic process in Libya following the 2011 revolution.

• Jolie has fronted a campaign against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency.

• In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague.

• On September 9, 2020, Jolie made a generous donation to two young boys, who were running a lemonade stand in London. The boys were raising money through the stall for the people of Yemen, as the country was on the brink of humanitarian crisis caused by the Saudi-led coalition and Houthi rebels.",False,1651353241.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6tz74u,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

But in the opening days of the war, circumstances were very different. Russia lost a shit ton of planes, ground vehicles, and personnel. 

Considering how many kills WWII aces racked up, (many hundreds, in many cases), I don't think it's too far outside the realm of possibility.

In the Gulf War, there was a Saudi pilot who took out two Iraqi AF planes (and chased-off a third) in one engagement:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/01/25/saudi-pilot-says-downing-two-mirages-was-easy/0f0e9bbd-9b47-48f4-9020-9b77aa6a5a54/

It was considered fairly extraordinary, by modern standards.  And he had a huge advantage, given the platforms (F-15 vs Mirage F-1s).

Again: in Ukraine, the defending side has a HUGE advantage; with attacking planes being unfamiliar with the terrain, not expecting resistance, and not having any idea where the enemy's air defenses were located (which is a HUGE constraint on where they can fly missions), plus: not all 40 of the planes he could have shot down were air-superiority fighters like his MiG-29.  An experienced and talented pilot can do some pretty amazing things in a MiG-29 in a dogfight scenario, and against bombers, transports, and other older planes, in a massed attack, it could very easily happen.

I would tend to believe it more, if the kills were verified by gun-camera footage, or ANY kind of documentation.  We haven't seen any of that.

>War in Ukraine...

>Ukrainian soldiers from Mariopol are surrounded. Yet they are still resisting and Mariopol is not entirely in Russian hands. Here's why…

>In war, there is nothing more expensive than taking territory with infantry (soldiers on foot). Taking a city with infantry, against infantry, causes the attacker a lot of casualties. This is why it often takes at least 3 times as many attacking soldiers as defending soldiers. When the terrain is easy to defend, sometimes up to 10 times more soldiers are needed.

I feel like the current conflict in eastern Ukraine with the Russian, north-izyum encirclement action against the JFO is very similar to the Japanese strategy in WWII of Kantai Kessen, the decisive battle doctrine. 

The Russian forces have been pushing hard at Izyum, apparently trying to break through the defenses there and encircle the entrenched forces on the Donetsk and Luhansk fronts. 
I guess I don't quite see where an encirclement becomes very helpful for them. They don't have the forces to secure the encirclement and they just spread their supply lines out for attacks like those against the forces in Sumy and Chernihiv. 
It's, at max, something like 40 BTGs attempting the encirclement. All of which have been heavily attritted from the fighting over Izyum and Mariupol. Like the lightning runs in the north, there is no second echelon of troops to sweep in and secure the conquered territory after a breakthrough. And like the past fighting, this means that if they do break through, they become streched thin and vulnerable to a defeat through logistical attrition. 
So, if the Russian idea is to break through and encircle, they would be repeating the mistakes of 1 month ago, and I don't want to think of the Russian commanders as that stupid. 
The other, smarter option, would be to threaten encirclement to draw the reinforcements and quick response brigades that would be going to the JFO and then attempt a decisive battle over the JFO, destroying the Ukrainian army in detail there.

If the DPR and LPR sources are to be believed, the Ukrainian forces in the JFO are doing fighting withdrawals. They describe it as the Ukrainians forcing the RU/DPR/LPR forces to fight for every bit of territory but not become decisively engaged. Instead, they retreat to another set of pre-prepared fighting positions and the fight continues again. This is very similar to the US Navy's response to Kantai Kessen at the start of WWII where they would fight the Japanese in small skirmishes, inflicting damage but then giving up territory before becoming decisively engaged. Once the US Navy had gained enough strength, using intelligence intercepts, they picked the time and place of the decisive battle and won at Midway. If this pattern were to hold, the 5-10 Ukrainian brigades that are being trained up using western equipment and trainers in the west would suddenly arrive and break RU forces at a point of their choosing, sort of like a land version of Midway. With the Western arms and intelligence, along with the near completion of their 3rd wave of mobilization, this is certainly possible.

Anyways, that's my current semi-informed thoughts on the matter based on the patterns I'm seeing.",False,1651374944.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6v59nm,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

There is no guaranteed outcome. People going on about Russia being doomed to lose, that makes us feel good, we want them to suffer.

Not everything is a bed of roses for Ukraine, sometimes things don't go well, but they are doing great despite it all.

Take nothing for granted as far as western nations supporting Ukraine. World powers have many times thrown smaller countries under the bus or forced them to accept a bad deal to make a problem go away. This is what putin is hoping for, this can never be allowed to happen.

If you keep your outlook on the situation realistic, you will not be driven down on days or moments that may not go well for Ukraine, because even if and when Russia advances, their paying a price that is likely too high.

Now what do I think will occur?

I think at the end of the day, Ukraine would let go of Crimea, in exchange for Donbas and the Luhansk. If the deal meant they would have security guarantees from the the EU and the US while they pursued those things. I think it would require that they allow the water to flow and not block it.

I think it is unreasonable and dangerous to expect Russia to pay any more than what they've already lost (sized and frozen assets) because in the long run, crippling them for too long strengthens China and makes regular Russians bitter (repeat Germany after WW1).

I think that is realistic at the end of the day and will require Ukraine to continue to grind up Russian military forces, while the sanctions must become tighter and tighter.

An outcome that sees Ukraine realistically break Russian forces and cause them to retreat? They would need more advanced weapons, including missiles they can launch from a safe location and be able to hit far into occupied territory (including Crimea) but infrastructure and military much deeper into Russia. Will we give them these weapons? I hope so, but it hasn't happened yet, it may be a case of continuing to boil the frog.

Also, cluster munitions fired from M270s will make it far easier for Ukraine to soften up dug in Russian positions and push forward.

Ukraine is faced with the prospect of fighting the additional Russian mobilization and perhaps another 250,000 soldiers--even if older reservists not in tip-top shape and training--coming across the border to bleed both countries dry.

In the end Russia keeps Crimea, gets to keep some (but not all) of their captured areas in the south and east, and a ceasefire comes in the late summer or autumn.  Russian troops stay in the area and an ugly insurgency and atrocities against civilians eventually ensues, threatening to throw both countries back into war.

It will take much longer than I think they currently realize. They're high on their own supply and their core leadership is still profoundly in denial when it comes to the challenges they face. In the meantime, Ukraine will only continue to grow stronger militarily and begin slowly making any Russian occupying forces pay a severe price for hanging around; first with heavy artillery barrages and precision strikes with drones, then eventually full on offensives with tanks and armored vehicles. 

I expect the Kherson region to eventually be fully under Ukrainian control once again and I have high hopes that Russian forces in the east will be pushed back to at least the 2014 boundaries. Russia will not be able to reinforce these areas before Ukraine has the strength to push them back. As for Mariupol and the land bridge that links up Russia to Crimea though, I'm less certain. There could be a prolonged stalemate over it as I'm sure Russia will be beyond desperate to have achieved some kind of victory from this disastrous war.

Long term? I think Russia's reputation as a world power is shattered beyond repair for at least a couple generations. Heavy doubt has been cast upon their ability to project power even modestly beyond their borders and that could lead to some unpredictable outcomes as its neighbors might sense an opportunity to use this to their advantage (Kazakhstan openly aligning itself more closely with the west is one possibility).

Ukraine will take years (possibly decades) to rebuild and the process will likely be highly uneven. So much has been destroyed and its people are traumatized. That doesn't get fixed overnight. They will also have no choice but to maintain a powerful military to guard against future Russian aggression and the costs that this will impose will come at the expense of reconstruction efforts.

As others have noted, many Cold War era risks related to the former no longer exist, e.g., looser control of weapons, communication/understanding between the actors, overall military mobilization, etc.

That said, some of the same factors that lower the risk of a world-ending exchange might make the limited use of nuclear weapons more attractive, as it could be argued the potential for escalation is much lower.

Since plenty of young Russians aren't brainwashed by state media because they've been using the internet and social media, they're aware of what's going on and that Putin and his government are the problem, not the Ukrainians.

 >The Yom Kippur War, also known as the Ramadan War, the October War, the 1973 Arab–Israeli War or the Fourth Arab–Israeli War, was an armed conflict fought from 6 to 25 October 1973 between Israel and a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria. The majority of combat between the two sides took place in the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights—both of which were occupied by Israel in 1967 — with some fighting in African Egypt and northern Israel. Egypt's initial objective in the war was to seize a foothold on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal and subsequently leverage these gains to negotiate the return of the rest of the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula.

The USSR while comprised of a couple non-Russian countries was still mostly Russia, which made it a little confusing. Ironically, it was our Lend Lease act that helped sort out several of the Red Armies problems. Too bad they're on the receiving end now.

There's all sorts of shit coming in from various countries, both NATO and non NATO, so it's a little hard to keep up. The Warsaw era stuff should be easy to integrate in the short term but from what I have seen the US is heavily involved in training the Ukrainian forces with their newer equipment. It helps that things like Javelins and NLAWs are fairly easy to use from what I have heard.

I'm with you on the assault rifles, on them being in the same class and all with slight differences. The Ukraine army seems to be running on a combination of Soviet/Russian equipment and designs of their own, which would make it hard for the  US to integrate its weapons. Nevertheless, an AK-74, which the Russians themselves have begun to replace, is their standard weapon, and the Russians won't be handing out ammo any time soon. The Ukraine SOF has already been spotted with the MCX Spear, a new assault rifle that's about to become the US standard rifle. It works very similarly to existing rifles from what I recall, unlike the bullpups which were shot down, except it uses a new type of ammo that will presumably become mass produced as it enters US ranks. With the Lend Lease Act, the US might be willing to give the rifle and a ton of ammo to go with it",1651375120.0,1651374906.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6uymhh,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,uf35hi,i6t2lxe,"> But the thing is why was his information wrong? 

Corruption is the most important factor. Putin believed the state of the Russian military to be much better than it actually is. So did Western intelligence, however. Putin didn't know because his underlings kept their corruption away from him, the Western intelligence services definitely made mistake as well however. Point is, everyone thought the Russian military was a lot stronger than they actually were. 

Another reason is that Putin thought he had bought the cooperation of a lot of Ukrainian people. Turns out those people just took his money and then didn't end up supporting him. However, Kherson is a rare ""success"" story, in the sense that the town leadership cooperated with the Russians allowing for an easy takeover. That was their plan for many more places. By all accounts, they really did think they would be received as ""liberators"" by the local populace. In that sense, it definitely was an intelligence failure from the Russians.

As for Zelenskyy, Putin underestimated him. But then again, so did everyone else. Before this war Zelenskyy was not a hugely popular president. People regarded him as inexperienced and not doing the best job. His performance is essentially seen as a wildcard and hugely unexpected. 

Timing was another problem. With Ukraine aligning itself ever closer to the EU and his own health getting visibly worse (either through sickness or age) he saw a closing window of opportunity. He desperately wanted to be the man to reunite Ukraine and Russia. He wanted to be remembered as a great leader five hundred years from now, that restored Russia's place in the world. So he got too eager, he wanted it too much and wasn't critical enough of his own plans.

And lastly, Putin simply fell into the trap that all dictators fall into. They create a system of authoritarianism and cronyism that does not reward merit but simply obedience. In other words, he started to enjoy the smell of his own farts a little too much and surrounded himself with people that agreed with him. In that sense, this last element exaggerates all his other mistakes. An impartial and self-critical leader would have perhaps looked more deeply into the state of the Russian military, or would have appointed competent people to run the FSB, or would have accounted for the possibility of Zelenskyy to rise to the occasion. 

But when no-one is around to challenge you, and you have convinced yourself out of desire of something. Then you lose grip on reality and you end up making one of the largest geopolitical blunders in history. And then it turns out you weren't some cold and calculating genius, but just yet another dictator that fell into the same trap that they all do.

b39fd45ebb854bb91ed3f18dede905bc,uf35hi,i6v2cnb,"Went through the study. As you said most of the costs were not related to war material.

Wait, didn't I specifically say ""Want to include economic losses"". I could have sworn..

But these costs in the study are all were based on the fact that the war exists. Therefore sanctions exist, therefore SWIFT action exists, therefore Russia as pariah state exists, therefore frozen assets exist, the Russian economy will ebb a certain percent this year, etc. But these are not based on the number of days of the war. Many of the highest costs in terms of sanctions happened early in the war, the low-hanging fruit. And there are limited options now, and they are at a much smaller scale (than say, freezing 300 billion). In other words, the sanctions, reduced economic activity, their entirely hypothetical social breakdown, these are not continuing at a daily rate. They are essentially one time costs (even multi-year GDP losses, since they also do not depend on the length of the war, at least in a proportional fashion). We will not sieze another $300 billion next month, and every month after that, for example. 

Now one exception is the oil and gas embargo, which can improve over time. But even if Russia loses 100 billion a year from reduced sales in Europe, and this war lasts 120 days, that would mean it would take 30 years to reach the $3 trillion losses projected.

And this study predicts that not only all of these things will happen, but that they will continue to happen for years! Russia will lose oil and gas revenue in the next few years because they can't instantly redeploy some of their sales (lack of pipelines, etc), but they can shift oil fairly quickly and gas over the course of a few years. The entire world is not Europe. And they haven't even started to lose these revenues yet. Which makes the ""losses so far"" sort of ridiculous

When you have a $1.5 trillion GDP and a study is projecting you will lose that entire GDP every 60 days, you have to predict these losses essentially for decades,  steady. But we can't predict that, and it's very unlikely that Russia will ""fall apart"" economically as they say. There will be some serious GDP losses and sanctions plus shortage of parts will affect many of their economic sectors. It will be a mess.  But their not going to just totally collapse, they will shift some sales to Asia, they will eventually find parts suppliers or develop some on their own. But they're just too much of a resource industry nation to collapse immediately.

And maybe they will eventually totally collapse due to a variety of factors, which isabout the only way this ridiculous study would come true. But we can't predict that. And it would require political collapse not just economic, because Russia can still be a successful economy with its resource-intensive economy and decently educated population. It will certainly take a hard hit, I'm talking significant GDP loss the first year, and fairly sizeable ones for a few years after that. But we can't project these far enough in advance to come up with say, 300 trillion for a war that lasts twice as long as this one.

But not to miss the main point... BARELY ANY OF THESE COSTS ARE DAILY. Russia won't be twice as isolated if the war lasts another 60 days. They won't have twice their assets seized. They won't have Europe decide to go from 0 oil to -20% oil. There is nothing Russia did specifically each day this week to incur more economic losses. The sanctions are already there. They are not escalated at a steady rate each day. The only daily losses are direct, which as the study showed, are not nearly that high.

And don't get me started on the fucking theoretical ones that they posited as fact. Significant social strife? They predicted this at the beginning and we all really hoped it would happen but Russia actually solidified behind Putin with no major resistance movements. Sort of like we predicted the Russian economy would collapse instantly and it didn't. These are guesses, and from an absolute worst-case scenario. Oh, and did I mention they aren't DAILY COSTS.

P.S. I can anticipate that Reddit will respond that ""the sanctions haven't kicked in yet"". True, and I look forward as much as any of you to hopefully see their economy start to ebb once they do. I'm just stating that we have been wrong before, and we honestly don't know how effectively we will be able to isolate them. We could crush completely or they could finagle their way out into a moderate recession. We don't know. And did I mention that these aren't daily costs?

In the study's defense, with direct costs it looks at the first 4 days of the war. And many of the sanctions happened in the first 4 days of the war. So maybe they were merely stating that they have lost $20 billion a day SO FAR. But that still doesn't forgive their failure to mention that long-term losses would not be proportional to the length of the war.

P.P.S. I want the Russian economy to completely collapse. And I hope it does. But this is ridiculous. In terms of actual daily costs incurred by the war, they are not spending anything remotely close to $25 billion and I showed in my earlier posts that this was impossible. To make that figure work you would have to predict theoretical future economic collapse which is not only guesswork BUT IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE FUCKING MEAN when they say ""the war is costing $25 billion a day.

However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the U.S. had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. The U.S. had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe.[148][149]

What about the cost of domestic violence in Russia?  That sounds crazy, but a lot of the cultural tolerance for domestic violence in Russia stems from losses in WWII.  ""Keep you man no matter what!"" That costs Russia money to this day.
