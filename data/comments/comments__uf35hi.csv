Day 66 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Around 3 AM there was a sudden big fire from shelling in the Northern Saltivka district, and it illuminated a big part of the sky. In the morning we saw what was burning and it turned out to be a 16 story apartment building, it literally just folded down the middle.

I don’t think that was normal shelling, it wasn’t confirmed, but from what we saw it had to be a big missile like Kalibr, as the whole building was completely destroyed. The good news is that it looks like it was empty, as most of the district is already a ghost town, there’s not a single undamaged building in the Northern Saltivka area, so they just wasted an expensive missile for nothing.

Today shelling wasn’t as bad and it happened during the day instead of the usual time. After the shelling stopped, news appeared about the liberation of 3 more settlements near Kharkiv, so what we were hearing most likely came from there. Right now we only hear our own artillery shooting at something.

And about how we can differentiate between incoming shelling and our own artillery, there are some subtle differences that we only started noticing after around a month of living under constant shelling. 

First difference is that when our artillery shoots we don’t just hear an explosion, we can actually hear the sound of recoil, as in the sound of moving metal parts right after the shot, and after it shoots we hear the shell fly through the air for a couple of seconds until it gets too far from us to hear it, most of the time we don’t actually hear where the shell lands.

The second difference is in the shockwaves, when there are explosions nearby, you can feel it because the building itself starts to shake, and windows almost break from the pressure, but when your own artillery fires nearby the most you feel is slight air pressure on the windows, despite the fact that the sound it makes when firing is still incredibly loud and can be easily mistaken for incoming shelling. 

And the third difference is that the sound of the explosion is very different. A shot from something like a howitzer sounds like a normal explosion, but when a shell lands it sounds exactly like thunderclap. Seriously, if you ever heard thunder, it means you know what incoming shelling sounds like. Now we will forever associate thunder with war.

Again I really appreciate all the support we’ve been getting, and I’m extremely thankful for it, it helps us immensely. Though it still feels very strange that complete strangers worry about us more than our own friends and relatives that live in Russia, the level of brainwashing they are under is just unreal, it feels like they can’t even process that there’s a war going on and we are in the middle of it.",False,1651359927.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,259,0,259,3,1,{'gid_2': 1}

From CNN's Michael Conte and Oren Liebermann

The US has begun additional training for Ukrainian armed forces at US military installations in Germany, the Defense Department announced. 

“These efforts build on the initial artillery training that Ukraine’s forces already have received elsewhere, and also includes training on the radar systems and armored vehicles that have been recently announced as part of security assistance packages,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said at a news briefing with reporters.

Kirby said that Germany is one of “roughly three” sites being used by the US to train Ukrainians outside of Ukraine, but would not disclose the others.

He also said “the bulk of the training” will be conducted by the Florida National Guard who had been training Ukrainians before being repositioned out of Ukraine in February prior to the Russian invasion.

“The recent reunion now of these Florida National Guard members with their Ukrainian colleagues, we are told, was an emotional meeting, given the strong bonds that were formed as they were living and working together before temporarily parting ways in February,” Kirby said.

Meanwhile, a senior US defense official said Friday that ""more than a dozen flights” carrying military assistance for Ukraine from the US are expected to arrive in the European region for transport into Ukraine “in the next 24 hours.""

Those flights will include shipments of “Howitzers, more 155 rounds, some of those Phoenix Ghost UAVs and even some of the radars that we talked about,” the official said.

This security assistance is all coming from US President Joe Biden’s latest presidential drawdown authority package, the official added, saying that 155 artillery rounds “continue to flow into Ukraine even over the last 24 hours.""

In the last 24 hours, “there have been almost 20 deliveries via airlift from seven different nations,” of security assistance, the official said.",False,1651294744.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,82,0,82,0,0,

A senior US defence official said on Friday that the Russian offensive is going much slower than planned in part because of the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.

“We also assess that because of this slow and uneven progress, again, without perfect knowledge of every aspect of the Russian plan, we do believe and assess that they are behind schedule in what they were trying to accomplish in the Donbas,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the US military’s assessment.

He said the US believes the Russians are “at least several days behind where they wanted to be” as they try to encircle Ukrainian troops in the east.

As the troops try to move north out of Mariupol so they can advance on Ukrainian forces from the south, their progress has been “slow and uneven, and certainly not decisive in any, in any event,” the official said.

Two evacuation buses have gone missing - military official

Two buses sent to rescue civilians from a Ukrainian town under heavy attack by Russian forces are reported to have gone missing.

A military official from Popasna, in the Donbas region, said one of the two buses, driven by volunteers, had come under fire inside the small town.

Mikola Khanatov said there was no news about the second vehicle - a school bus driven by a local history teacher.

One of the volunteers, Galina Kroshka, said three buses had been sent to Popasna on Friday to help with the evacuation of hundreds of civilians.

Two buses failed to return to the town of Bakhmut. Earlier in the day 31 civilians had been brought to safety.

“We’re very worried. Our buses didn’t come back, and we’ve had no contact with them since yesterday. We can’t go to Popasna ourselves until the situation is clearer,” said Galina, who, with her husband, has been ferrying civilians, and humanitarian aid, between the towns for several weeks.

Ukrainian commander inside Mariupol steel plant says evacuations of civilians have begun
From CNN's Julia Kesaieva and Tim Lister

Some civilians have been evacuated from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol after a ceasefire was introduced, according to a commander in the Azov Regiment, one of the Ukrainian soldiers trapped at the plant.

Capt. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, said the ceasefire, which was supposed to begin at 6 a.m. local time, ended up starting at 11 a.m. local time.

""As of now, it's the truth, both sides follow the ceasefire regime,"" he said.

The evacuation convoy was very delayed, he said. ""Since 6 a.m., we've been waiting for the evacuation convoy to arrive, which only arrived at 6:25 p.m.""

""We have brought 20 civilians to the agreed meeting point, whom we've managed to rescue from under the rubble. These are women and children. We hope these people will go the agreed destination, which is Zaporizhzhia, the territory controlled by Ukraine,"" Palamar said.

""As of now, the rescue operation is ongoing, conducted by the servicemen of Azov - we rescue the civilians from under the rubble,"" he added.

""These are women, children and the elderly,"" he said in a video message on the regiment's Telegram channel.

""We hope that this process will be further extended and we will successfully evacuate all civilians,"" he said.

""As for the wounded — those people who require urgent medical care — it is unclear to us why they are not being evacuated and their evacuation to the territory controlled by Ukraine is not being discussed,"" he added.
""I emphasize that we ask to guarantee the evacuation not just for civilians but also for our wounded servicemen who require medical care.""
TASS, Russia's state news agency, said earlier Saturday that a group of civilians left the steel plant. A correspondent on the scene told TASS that a total of 25 people came out, including six children under the age of 14. CNN cannot independently verify the TASS reporting.

There are thought to be hundreds of people inside the steel complex, including dozens injured during an intense Russian bombardment over the past several weeks. The latest satellite images of the plant show that many of its buildings have been reduced to ruins.

The defenders of the Azovstal plant said that attacks on Wednesday night had hit the makeshift hospital inside the complex, greatly adding to the number of injured.

**The Zelenskyy effect: Why Ukraine’s “Ze” is defeating Russia’s “Z”**

*Rarely has a politician so visibly surprised so many. The man Ukrainians call “Ze” has come to symbolize his nation’s fierce resistance to what many experts initially thought was a Russian military juggernaut. Following his lead, tens of thousands of ordinary Ukrainians have joined the all-volunteer Territorial Defense Force and one poll found 39 per cent of adult citizens are actively volunteering to support the war effort more broadly. Farmers have used their tractors to “reclaim” military hardware. Every day, protests occur in towns and cities under temporary occupation. And across the country, elderly villagers try to stop tanks with their bare hands.*  
  
*Yet this full-on Ukrainian mobilization, and Zelenskyy’s potential to rally it, should have been no surprise. The reason for its success is not that Zelenskyy’s special leadership traits set him apart from his country. Instead, what is making him extraordinary in war comes from his very ordinariness as a Ukrainian. As such, he inherits a tradition of dissent and a fierce civic sense that is baked into the country’s identity. He is a Ukrainian everyperson, albeit in a way few others could be.*

“We are actively demining the liberated territory. Every day several dozen settlements are added to the list of those where demining has been completed,” he said.

Zelensky also said officials are “doing everything” to restore roads and access to medical, educational and financial services.

After that, presumably, he'd hope the West would give up or slow down on following sanctions due to Ukraine being a lost cause, like Crimea.

This failed for a variety of reasons.  Practically minutes after Putin declared war, it was reported that Russian saboteurs were attempting to take over Kyiv's airport, which would allow Russian troops to basically fly in to Kyiv unopposed and take the capital with little resistance. This failed, and the rest of the nearby airports were either purposefully or unintentionally destroyed, as places like Hostomel Airport were destroyed from constant fighting. Plus, even if the Russian were to land, they would likely get immediately hit by Ukrainians running on US fed intel.

The second reason, which is related to the first, was in the skies. It was also presumed by many that Russia would immediately take air supremacy, as they did in Syria, allowing Russian fighters and bombers to do whatever they liked. This also failed, as Ukraine was able to shoot down several fighter jets, either with jets of their own or by hitting them with AA. It's also reported that the infamous VDV paratroopers were mercilessly killed, either by getting shot upon touching down or the aircraft containing them getting blown up.

The third reasons was Russian supply lines. Although Russia might have some fancy equipment at military parades and a good reputation from fucking up Nazi Germany in a defensive war, it has become clear that Russia hasn't really learned any lessons on how to mount an offensive war since the Winter War, in which they massively underperformed. You would see some monty python shit on the streets, Russian tanks and vehicles breaking down and stuck on civilian highways. Russian vehicles are literally unable to go more than a dozen miles or so from their bases without running out of gas or breaking down. In an offensive war, that's completely disastrous.

All of this has combined to place Putin in a war that is more or less unwinnable, at least without a draft, which has the potential to cause chaos domestically. The Ukrainian army has been able to fully mobilize, set up defensive lines, and hunker down in cities, effectively turning them into giant tank land mines with buildings providing great cover for NLAWS and Javelins. Foreign military aid is flooding in, as militaries across the world give hand-me downs of their old NATO equipment that is still miles better than the Ukrainians, and Russians, Soviet era equipment.  But now, with even better equipment such as Howitzers, Bushmasters, and a  Lend Lease act pending, Ukraine is about to get some truly world class equipment. This could potentially allow Ukraine to break through the existing separatist/ newly made Russian defensive lines, and allow for a decisive Ukrainian victory. There was a report from a top British official that this is now the goal, to destroy Putin's ability to wage war right here, right now, in Ukraine while their hands are tied.",False,1651359535.0,t3_uf35hi,t3_uf35hi,,0,57,0,57,0,0,

Despite these losses, Russian troops still have equipment to launch additional attacks, Zelensky said.

 ""Of course, the occupiers still have equipment in stock. Yes, they still have missiles to strike at our territory,"" he added. ""But this war has already weakened Russia so much that they have to plan even fewer military equipment for the parade in Moscow.""

Russia plans to hold its traditional Victory Day parade in Red Square May 9, commemorating the German surrender to the Soviet Union in the Second World War.

The Ukrainian President also said Russia has already lost more than 23,000 soldiers since the invasion began. CNN cannot independently verify this claim. 

Russia has sporadically released casualty figures that are low and which observers deem to be a massive underestimate. Two days prior to Russia’s update, two senior NATO military officials estimated the number of Russian soldiers killed in action in Ukraine to be between 7,000 and 15,000. Around the same time, other US officials had put Russian losses in a similar range -- between 7,000 and 14,000 Russian soldiers killed -- but they have expressed “low confidence” in those estimates.

Earlier in the month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov briefly admitted Russia had suffered “significant” losses of its troops in Ukraine, calling the losses “a huge tragedy” for the country in an interview with Sky News.

On the southern borders of Ukraine's defense, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed the enemy electronic warfare station ""Repellent-1"", 3 anti-aircraft guns, anti-aircraft missile system ""Arrow-10"", as well as a communications vehicle and 42 invaders.

Source : OK ""South""

Literally : ""On the Nikolaev-Kherson direction fighting continues. The enemy having no activity in advance, has fixed on positions and continues artillery and mortar attacks.

At new attempts of reconnaissance of a situation by drones, the enemy lost 2 more ""Eagles-10"" in the Nikolaev area. The strikes of our units were devastating.

In the Kherson region, our soldiers destroyed the enemy electronic warfare station ""Repellent-1"" with artillery fire.

Another attack on enemy targets on Zmiiny smashed 3 anti-aircraft guns, the Strela-10 anti-aircraft missile system, as well as a communication vehicle - a server with telecommunications equipment. ""

Details : In addition, OK ""South"" reports the destruction of 42 Russian invaders.

A missile strike was fired on Odessa again . This time, 3 Onyx missiles were launched from the occupied territory of Crimea by the Bastion missile system, which hit the runway. The destruction led to the impossibility of further operation of the runway. There are no victims.

On the eve of May 2, the campaign to shake up Odessa, border regions and attempts to incite pro-Russian forces continues.

Thus, information about the sabotage was obtained promptly - the circulation of the newspaper ""Transnistria"" from May 2, 2022 with the alleged official appeal of the people of Transnistria to Putin for protection from the attack of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

""Disclosure of this provocation discredited the actions of enemy forces,"" the OK South said in a statement.

The enemy's naval group continues to blockade navigation in the northwestern part of the Black Sea and threatens to launch missile strikes throughout Ukraine.""

**Sanction the Right People in Russia**

*Sanctions have affected Russian politicians and propagandists — but not ideologues.*

*But I would say that Western sanctions seem to be missing much more important targets. People like Solovyov, Skabeyeva, and Sheinin are brainless clowns who may voice some thoughts by no means produced by them.* 

*But those who created the modern Russian ideology and actively disseminated it for years remain untouched. As Mr. Putin now rejects the fundamental rules of the current international order, I should remind readers who first proposed the vision of “a world without rules” that will appear if Russian interests are neglected: Sergei Karaganov, Fyodor Lukyanov, Timofei Bordachev and their colleagues at the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy and Valdai Discussion Club.* 

*Dr. Karaganov frantically defended Russia’s right to reshape post-Soviet borders; argued that NATO is a “political cancer” that aims to kill the “healthy” Russian state; that Ukraine has no right to be a sovereign state, etc. This trio, together with Dmitry Suslov, Andrei Ilnitsky, Andrei Sushentsov and some others have for years glorified Russia's “pivot to the East,” claiming that Moscow’s alliance with Beijing would end American supremacy.*

Here’s some highlights:

>	If these Ukrainian claims are at all accurate (it should be noted that documented, photographed claims of Russian losses are about two thirds of those claimed, so they certainly should not be out by much) then the Russians have lost 217 tanks and 404 APCs since the battle started

>	Even if they are exaggerrated by 20 percent, Russian losses would be extreme, around 20 full strength BTGs worth? And according to the Pentagon, the Russians have 92 BTGs in Ukraine.

>	That means they could have lost 20% of their tanks and APCs in Ukraine since the battle started (thats if the BTGs were at that point close to full strength. If they were considerably weaker, it could be higher).

…

>	And now some worrying signs are creeping in for the Russians. 1st, there are indications that the Ukrainians are starting to deploy the loitering munition UAVs (Switchblade type) that were sent just a little while ago. This could be a major Russian problem

…

>	Another worrying sign for the Russians are growing reports (and pictures) of accurate, long range artillery fire by the Ukrainians. Considering Ukr artillery capabilities should grow over the coming weeks, this will add to Russian losses.

I've been listening to a lot of the recent intercepts from the Russian front and the status seems to be that most BTG's are severely understaffed and afraid to report troop numbers. Their artillery works fine but often they end up shelling positions the Ukrainians have already left (though they are still getting it right at times). Air support with CAS seems absent.

They severely lack infantry. This would explain why the front is moving so slow. They use their artillery as much as they can but have very little forces to exploit it. This could just be that the intercepts come from the BTG's that have it especially bad so I wouldn't get too high on the hopium but it's still something that corroborates many predictions about Russia's struggle with the front.",False,1651327332.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6sa7je,,1,10,0,10,0,0,

a6df2a26d9d85787221ade1dd186d6fa,uf35hi,i6syxhw,"Well, quite frankly, Putin had a lot of reasons to think that. Mostly the weak EU/US reaction to his excursions in Georgia and Crimea in 2008 and 2014. Additionally, Putin believed he would run over Ukraine in a matter of weeks, which would present a ""fait accompli"" that the West would have no choice but to accept. Additionally, he thought that the divisions in the west could be exploited to prevent the heaviest of sanctions from coming through. Then, in a few years as things would normalize the worst sanctions would be removed and all would be ""well"". 

However, there were three factors that he completely misjudged that brought him to this error. First is the successful Ukrainian military defense. This prevented the ""fait accompli"" and gave the West needed time to formulate a strategy and execute a response. Secondly, the role of social media that showed the enormous suffering happening on the ground, which allowed western audiences to relate directly to the Ukranians. Ukrainian people were sharing their stories everywhere in good spoken English, and people sympathized creating a groundswell of support and pressure on EU politicians. And lastly, the stellar performance of Zelenskyy and his team, which performed great PR and diplomacy, further adding to domestic support in EU countries for sanctions and actions, allowing them to extract the maximum possible concessions out of the EU/US.

Because of these things, the EU suddenly was given the time and the ability to form a unified response. If Ukraine had been overrun, or had its leadership failed, there would have been division (""Why incur huge economic damage if it's already too late for Ukraine"") that Russia could have then exploited further. 

The brutality and war crimes of the Russian military has only served to stiffen the resolve after that. Again, those war crimes would likely not have happened without strong Ukrainian resistance, or at least to a much lesser degree.

So all in all, it was not entirely unreasonable for Putin to think he would get away with it, based on the information he had at the time. Clearly his information was *wrong*, and therefore his calculation also. But ultimately, his actions were ""rational"", in the sense that they were logically structured to achieve his desired outcome, it's just that their factual foundations were not sound.

Edit: I do think some additional credit belongs here to Biden and his team. They have been ahead on the Russian's at every step and started to build a coalition against Russia months before the actual invasion. US sharing of highly classified intelligence as well as putting pressure on the EU absolutely helped as well. Likely Biden was underestimated by Putin as well, and the US appetite for sanctions and foreign intervention (after the Afghanistan debacle) was estimated to be lower than it came out in reality.",1651337654.0,1651335655.0,t3_uf35hi,t1_i6swthn,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

Consequently, he doubled down by pushing the northern attack. Which was … disastrous.

At that stage he’d cooked his elite units and admitting defeat was completely unacceptable because he’d have to face the music at home.

So he’s now doubling down on the East offensive.

He’s trashed his entire regular army if this doesn’t work. The problem is he has no way of turning back… it would involve him admitting he’s wrong.
