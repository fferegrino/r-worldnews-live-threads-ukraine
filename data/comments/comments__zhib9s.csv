Day 289-290 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday not much happened and it was mostly quiet with no missile strikes, though the shelling of Kupiansk and other towns close to the border still continues every day. Apparently, that missile that hit residential buildings 2 days ago landed somewhere around Pisochyn, which is why we heard the explosions so clearly, it’s not far away from Kharkiv at all. Sadly 1 of the 4 civilians that were injured by the missile did not survive. 

They are actually starting to use their Shahed drones again, but as usual they are not aiming them at Kharkiv, they pretty much never did. Today they sent 15 drones at Odesa’s energy infrastructure, 10 of them were shot down, but the remaining 5 managed to hit their targets and now the entirety of Odesa is without electricity, though apparently there is still enough electricity to power critical infrastructure, so that’s good.

Yesterday it was pretty funny seeing Putin talking to the journalists and saying that he is the only one they can trust, everyone else, including their own military correspondents, is lying to them about the “special military operation”. Of course, he also said that they are having absolutely no problems on the front and that everything is going according to plan, does he even believe in his own words? 

He also basically said that he doesn’t regret starting the war, but he does regret not starting it sooner, while we were still weak and easy to conquer. And then people continue to tell us that we should negotiate with Russia anyway. I wonder if those same people would negotiate with Russia if they were in our position? Somehow, I doubt it.

He tells of flying in (back in March) in a group of 4 helicopters, flying so low that they’d brush tree-tops.  That the choppers were loaded with medical supplies, starlink, ammunition, so full that he had to stand.  He had no fear Bc of his adrenaline.  He says that when landed, the helicopters were unloaded, then loaded up with wounded and flew out, in less than 20 minutes, all while artillery teams drew Russians’ fire away.  More deliveries were made clandestinely by boat.

He tells of the surgeries performed under fire, the constant bombing of their medical ward, operating room, the walls collapsing and killing all the wounded soldiers—more than once.

He points out that he wasn’t supposed to be taken prisoner—that Geneva puts him in a special class, and he was supposed to be immediately returned to Ukrainian-held territory. But he was taken to Olenivka as a POW. He continued treatment on the soldiers there—but wounds were healing and mostly needed antibiotics. He was in the barracks adjacent when the terrorists bombed the POWs.  He that that barrack had been cleaned, arranged, outfitted the days prior (new POWs arriving.

And then also had chat groups of other underground resistance fighters.  This was good in that he could plan—they followed collaborators, attacked them—but bad bc too many loose ends when so many locals know.  They bought weapons, explosives thru local inventor-mechanic-machinist types.  But then had to figure out how to get around with these.  He says that to get materials, weapons thru checkpoints, need women or children/youth.  But that expands how many people know the secret, and it’s just a matter of time until someone gives you up under torture. 

He was taken, without a chance to erase his secret phone, together with another partisan in July, from their secret meeting spot in a raid.  The location also housed weapons and lots of pro-Ukrainian items people asked to store there for safe keeping (flags, books, etc). Spent months under daily torture.  

But he was released due to **Russian incompetence**.  He says that while there, the Russians rotated personnel twice.  The first group of Russians, who had loads of evidence thoroughly tortured with the aim of extracting information.  Beyond being resistant to divulging, he would be beaten so severely around his lungs and diaphragm he struggled to breathe, much less speak. Also, the beatings could be worse if speak, bc wrong answer.

He says those Russians, however, **left for Ryazan, with all his property, and consequently all major evidence against him (on iPhones, iPad, computer).** The second batch were only torturing him as revenge when UA attacked them, so became less frequent.

By October, there was a second change—this was the third set of personnel—and **no one told these occupiers that he organized resistance**.  All the “evidence” against him—which indeed was plentiful—was long gone.

The new guards told him to write a bio, so he spewed out lies about Russia/Fatherland/greatness, and he was wrong to resist being “liberated”—the **Russians read it, said “well there’s no evidence against you,” and released him** in October, a month before liberation.

He now wants to officially join the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

^(Two things make me chuckle reading this story.  One, was during the early days of electric shock and waterboarding, 8 Russians were in there screaming questions at him, all interrupting one another, trying to find out who else was in the underground resistance.  But one was asking, in earnest, “but why do you call us vatniks?”)

^(Second, this: *Once I was taken from my cell to another room, things found during the search of the apartment were laid out—flags from Ilovaisk, portraits of Bandera and Shukhevich—which an acquaintance had asked me to hide.  Russian journalists were in the room, one standing with a camera, the other asking questions. She held up Bandera’s portrait and asked if he is a hero of Ukraine. I replied that I did not understand history. She then asked if I knew that Bandera collaborated with the Germans. I asked how he could cooperate if he was sitting in their concentration camp? They said they knew it for sure. I snapped: what do you say about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact then? And then I notice that the guy looks out from behind the operator's camera and threatens me with his fist.”*)",1670707659.0,1670697737.0,t3_zhib9s,t3_zhib9s,,0,94,0,94,0,0,

In a Novosibirsk publication, practically everything tagged *SVO* is scathing—stories of those deployed, those who volunteered, those who were mobilized, those who have returned, and those who are wounded.  

- Multiple stories of visibly wounded Russians denied promised benefits—together with pictures of their handicaps and official letters of denials.  It’s so prevalent that “wounded from SVO” has not become its own section of the newssite.

- A general indifference towards the plight of this region’s men.  Explaining how these men are from villages, they have to travel 6hrs to get to Novosibirsk, rent a hotel room, just to see vet affairs office.  Then, they follow vet affairs office paperwork, it’s sent off to Moscow, comes back denied for some trite reason.  Story after story. The men from the region only went because promised enormous sums, descriptions of their poor families—but promised benefits are not issued.  Not even to the wounded.

- Multiple stories of volunteers quitting due to command incompetence, inadequate supplies, no training.  (But written in support, not critical of the choice.) One man was close to retirement, was to get a certain wage, verified it with a general—and was in no better position to obtain his promised wages or necessary equipment than any of the mobliks. 

- Sending them in unequipped.  It’s depicted as being as dire, as deficient in needed supplies, as incompetently led, just as it is in western press. Maybe more so, bc it’s all first hand accounts.  Inadequate clothing, sent forward with no weapons.  Photos of summer boots in snow.

Actually, looking back on it Russia *should have* been able to take Kyiv in just *two* days.  But for two issues.

FIRST: The Army had much of its best trained men—the most trained and hardened Russian troops from the Trans-Baikal, Siberian and Ural districts, the so-called ""combat Buryats” like sitting ducks.

>*""Kyiv could really be taken in two days. What prevented them from doing this... Crazy centralization of the military leadership. Since they had the order ""already on already""—\[meaning only proceed for known- order\]—when they reached a certain point, they did not know what to do next. During these pauses, their columns were destroyed. The fact that they didn't know where they were going—they didn't know the geography, map, location \[was the first mistake that prevented quick capture\].*

SECOND, despite the CIA Director personally telling Kyiv of Russia’s plans for Gostomel, it apparently was inadequately protected, but was eventually able to prevent Russian takeover:

>In addition, he noted the feat of the Gostomel brigade of the National Guard—which at that time consisted of 150 men, because most of them then left for the east and only the defense of the airfield remained.  
>  
>On the morning of February 24, the defenders of the airfield had to deal with 30 helicopters that tried to land from 700 to 1,500 trained paratroopers of the Ryazan division on the airfield.  
>  
>*“Four helicopters were shot down at once. For two days, the airfield changed hands, reinforcements of special forces arrived. The Russians had anticipated the landing of their landing force there, which was supposed to create a bridgehead for 30 cargo aircraft, which at that time were ""hovering"" over the territory of Belarus. If all those \[Russians\] had successfully landed in Gostomel, the way to Kyiv would have been open to them.""*

He points to their potential in showing how far reached:

>According to him, the Russians managed to reach the final tram line that leads from Kyiv to [Pushcha Voditsa](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pushcha-Vodytsya,+Kyiv,+Ukraine,+02000/@50.49465,30.3805201,12.21z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x472b2d7cbab263ab:0xcd17a7b8c2df72a9!8m2!3d50.5392207!4d30.3544038?hl=en-us) that is, from the north, the enemy stood on the border of the capital.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 10 December 2022

- Iran has become one of Russia's top military backers since Russia invaded Ukraine.

- Iran's support to the Russian military is likely to grow in the coming months: Russia is attempting to obtain more weapons, including hundreds of ballistic missiles. In return Russia is highly likely offering Iran an unprecedented level of military and technical support that is transforming their defence relationship.

- Russia has highly likely expended a large proportion of its stock of its own SS-26 Iskander short range ballistic missiles, which carry a 500kg warhead up to 500km. If Russia succeeds in bringing a large number of Iranian ballistic missiles into service, it will likely use them to continue and expand its campaign of strikes against Ukraine's critical national infrastructure.",False,1670656813.0,t3_zhib9s,t3_zhib9s,,0,67,0,67,0,0,

Lånen är amorteringsfria och ska betalas tillbaka till unionen inom tio år.

Förslaget antogs av rådet skriftligen på lördagen och läggs fram för Europaparlamentet – EU:s andra lagstiftande organ – för ett möjligt antagande i nästa vecka.

Russia wanted a high profile hostage who wouldn't garner any sympathy from within Russia. And they knew her being gay and black would instantly make her less sympathetic to right-wing voters in the US and Europe. They knew a drug charge would take away any sympathy she might get.

The guy they traded her for is useless to them. His contacts and networks are severely out of date. He has likely leaked what he knew to the US just to get better prison accommodations.

The psychological effect of the recent Ukrainian counter attacks was considerable, but I'm skeptical about the possibility to destroy these bases to a point, that Russia is no longer able to carry out such terror attacks. For that, there would be much more needed than just some long range cruise missiles and drones.

Especially drones don''t need much infrastructure to be used. They are a kind of poor mans air force. Even if Ukraine manages to render all major air bases (including the ones in Siberia) unusable for heavy bombers, the relatively small and primitive drones, like the ones Iran is supplying, would still be usable from improvised bases. 

Because of that, im not convinced that it would be the right decision to spent a lot of resources into enabling Ukraine to engage in large scale long range attacks on air bases all over Russia. The same resources would be much more useful to strengthen the Ukrainian ground forces that are pushing the Russian invaders out of the occupied territories of Ukraine and thus ending the war as fast as possible.",False,1670660571.0,t3_zhib9s,t1_izmnvf4,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

The US also has as philosophy that it should have enough material and men to fight two different wars at the same time. If the US can't even help Ukraine against the country that has done the most to hurt the US in recent years, then they have failed badly and it's a major scandal.
