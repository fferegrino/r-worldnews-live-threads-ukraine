Day 375-376 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were somewhat quiet, there were no missile strikes, but there was one pretty big drone attack yesterday. Well, it was only 15 Shaheds, so it’s not exactly a lot of drones, but it’s the biggest attack in quite some time. The vast majority of them were intercepted, but apparently 2 of them weren’t, and I’m not sure where they landed. Another 2 of the drones were flying somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, not sure what their target was, but thankfully they were intercepted without reaching it.

Our officials keep saying that the chance of new missile strikes is very high right now, but they were saying that for the entire past week and so far no big missile strikes happened. It really does seem like they are actually *very* short on all of their precision missiles now, before it was just Iskanders that they stopped using because they ran out of them, but now they are barely even using any of their Kalibrs. I think the last “massive” missile strike was not only small (just 32 missiles), but also happened almost 3 weeks ago, so they are not even following their usual pattern of doing a new missile strike every 10-14 days.

That execution of one of our soldiers by the Russians was really enraging, by the looks of it the guy was standing in a shallow grave too, fucking bastards. What the fuck do they intend to accomplish by doing this? They just created a martyr for us for no fucking reason, and they don’t even get anything in return. We won’t start killing our POWs in revenge as that would just be extremely stupid. Even completely disregarding the moral point of view, POWs are a valuable wartime resource, you don’t just throw it away to spite your enemy. This is such a monumentally stupid thing to do, and for what exactly? And why the fuck were they filming it too?",False,1678146282.0,t3_11jns6n,t3_11jns6n,,0,118,0,118,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 6 March 2023  


* The Russian military has continued to respond to heavy armoured vehicle losses by deploying 60-year-old T-62 main battle tanks (MBT).  

* There is a realistic possibility that even units of the 1st Guards Tank Army (1 GTA), supposedly Russia’s premier tank force, will be re-equipped with T-62s to make up for previous losses.  

* 1 GTA had previously been due to receive the next-generation T-14 Armata MBT from 2021.  

* In recent days, Russian BTR-50 armoured personnel carriers, first fielded in 1954, have also been identified deployed in Ukraine for the first time.  

* Since summer 2022, approximately 800 T-62s have been taken from storage and some have received upgraded sighting systems which will highly likely improve their effectiveness at night.  

* However, both these vintage vehicle types will present many vulnerabilities on the modern battlefield, including the absence of modern explosive reactive armour.

There is a frenzy of rumours and speculation in the Russian media about who might have been the patient of the German ambulance plane that visited Moscow's Vnukovo airport.

According to Flightradar 24, the plane took off on Saturday 4 March from Frankfurt and flew to Moscow via Latvian airspace. At Vnukovo airport, the plane waited for more than 2 hours and then departed for Nuremberg, Germany, according to flight information.

It is not known who was a passenger and presumed patient on the plane. There is even speculation as to whether the plane was taking a patient from Moscow to Germany or whether the plane was bringing a patient from Germany to Moscow.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the European Union banned Russian aircraft from flying in its airspace. Russia has also imposed its own restrictions on aircraft from ""unfriendly countries"", so the ambulance flight from Germany to Moscow has most likely required some special permissions.

\- The plane has hardly flown to save a perfectly ordinary citizen of Moscow. Something special has happened when even Latvia has opened its airspace for this flight, Russian political analyst Andrei Okun wrote on his Telegram channel.

Russian media and social media channels have been abuzz with wild rumours about who might have been the patient transported on the flight.

One speculation is that the patient could have been cellist and businessman Sergei Roldugin, a close friend of President Vladimir Putin, whose health is said to have deteriorated. Another speculation is that the patient could have been Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is also said to have health problems.

There were also rumours that the patient might have been Nikolai Rastorguyev, lead singer of Putin's favourite band Lyube, but Rastorguyev soon came forward to deny the allegations. Rastorguyev was also demonstrably in Russia at the weekend, when he performed with his band in Vladimir on Saturday night.

The Ambulance plane is of the same type and from the same private airline that once flew its plane to bring Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny to Berlin for treatment after his Novichok poisoning.

In August 2020, Navalny was picked up from Omsk to Berlin by a German Bombardier Challenger 604 with registration number D-AFAD, while the Bombardier Challenger 604 that arrived in Moscow on Saturday carries registration number D-AFAA. Both aircraft are owned by FAI Rent-A-Jet, a company headquartered in Nuremberg, Germany.

In the summer of 2022, the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported, based on its own investigations, that private planes and helicopters belonging to Russian businessmen have been flying in European airspace despite sanctions. In total, the magazine found dozens of such flights.

> The Ukrainian government told Bild that the decision to stay with Bakhmut was the right one. While holding on to Bakhmut, the Russian army suffered serious damage both in terms of personnel and material. For example, many tanks and armored vehicles were destroyed.

Zaluzhny POV:


> . . . although the losses of the Russians are much greater, many Ukrainian soldiers also died during the selfless defense of the city— it was against this background that Zaluzhny insisted on a possible exit from Bakhmut at an early stage.

> ...from a military point of view, the city has no strategic importance, the exit from the destroyed city would not be of decisive importance. 

> Zaluzhny’s position is shared by the majority of Bakhmut fighters. A Ukrainian military analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Bild that the vast majority of soldiers in Bakhmut do not understand why the city is being held.

Imagine for a moment.  Putin and his close knot of confidants are huddled in a bunker: calling every shot. Imagine the consequences of a loss are unacceptable to them, therefore every possible avenue for ""victory"" must be explored without reserve.   

This leads us to suppose a siege mentality where ""optimism"" is rewarded and ""pessimism"" is punished.   And finally, add in that leadership is informed of the state on the ground by folks with a keen and clear understanding of this situation, no desire to die, a deftly practiced skill laying blame on someone else.  

And imagine what the advisors are hearing, and putting in their reports.  Up until recently they will be hearing from all over the information sphere that (a) Ukrainians are fighting hard, but preparing to retreat, (b) the tactics are expensive but working, and their reports conclude:  (c) if we continue for just a bit longer, we'll get there.   Thus, an ""optimistic"" plan is approved to send the resources needed to finish the job, whatever it takes.  And Russia's hope is pinned on the shoulders of Wagner, with a bit of scurrying in the corridors of power for the military to climb upon Wagner's shoulders and stand tall at the moment of victory.

This sets a logistics chain in motion, like a wave, where men and materials are moved into theatre from other staging areas.   Unlike sound waves, which travel quickly, logistics waves take weeks.  Ukraine and her allies watch this wave, and gauge its approach, and equip to ride its crest.   

And then dash the hope.  By not leaving.  By counter-attacking.  By reinforcing rather than withdrawing.  And it's clear to everyone that the wave of hope is likely to break on the rocks of this fortress.

Back in the bunker, the advisors can see the hope fading.  And begin to lay the blame. Right between the shoulders of hope, also on Wagner.   Where deniability is plausible. Where failure has a name that is not Tzar.  And hope is shifted elsewhere.  New orders are cut, redirecting logistics to the new focus of hope. 

But logistics have momentum.   Men and materials continue to flow into Wagner's now-doomed mission... setting up a pocket of men and materials, ahead of supplies and reinforcements that haven't yet cut off... giving the illusion of continuing resupply. A pocket, to be smashed once it starves.

... 

The beauty of fiction is that you can invent any narrative you want. I just made this up.  It's just as likely there's some other strategic purpose that fits the ""reversal"" of position in the information space.

While this may not be what's going on, unless I miss my guess, something else IS going on.  I strongly  suspect Ukraine is using lag in the Russian chain of command to whipsaw Russian logistics back and forth, like a kid playing in the bathtub making monster waves.  Except with deadly consequence.

You're right.  Sometimes you fight were the enemy is because that is where the enemy is.

Ukraine has built up defenses and a plans for multiple contingencies for Bahkmut, including evacuation.  They know they are going to kill Russians there.  Why give up the city for unknowns later if defense of the city is still practical?

&nbsp;

The most offensively capable forces the Russians have at the moment are tied down in a dirty dog fight where their armor and IFV's mean nothing, gain them no advantage.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, what is happening on the Ukrainian side?

Think about it for a second. Is this a case of Ukraine being stretched to the limits, feeding what they can manage to into Bakhmut, desperatly trying to hold, and this is it, this is what they have available?

&nbsp;

Where is all the western gear? Its been pouring into Ukraine for months upon months. Where is it? We saw Bulldog's and Humvee's to some extent being used in the Kharkiv and Kherson offensives. But where are the AMX10's, ACMAT Bastion's, Dingo's, Marders, Iveco LMV's, the Armored BV206's, Dzik2's, BVP M80A's, URO Vamtak's, BMC Kirpi's, Stormer's, Samaritan's, Samson's, Scimitar's, Spartan's, Mastiff's, Wolfhounds's, Husky's?

&nbsp;

Where are the now *hundreds* of M113's, *hundreds* of M72's of upgraded variants, the Bradley's and yes the new Tanks? 

Its nowhere near Bakhmut, thats for sure. 

And despite now having been backfilled with *a lot* of artillery, Ukraine's artillery usage is pretty moderate at the moment.

From May and onwards last year the amount of gear delivered is staggering when you check the lists. And we have very good Osint sources for both gear committed and gear lost.

&nbsp;

Very few of these have been observed comitted to the frontlines. Very few. The numbers are telling a pretty clear history when you look into it. 

&nbsp;

Ukraine has been building and training operational reserves for 6-8 months now. And they have got to be fucking big by now.

>How do we know the security forces wouldn’t flip to Prigozhin’s side? “The F.S.B. can’t stand Prigozhin,” said Roman Dobrokhotov, editor of The Insider, Bellingcat’s Russian investigative partner, which has unmasked numerous G.R.U. and F.S.B. plots. “The F.S.B. hates everyone who is untouchable because they want to control everything.” It’s true. The F.S.B. also famously loathes the only other man in Russia with a personal army, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, though his ambitions are focused more tightly on Chechnya and the Muslim world. Kadyrov’s own security forces rule Chechnya with ruthless efficiency and the power of the F.S.B. stops at Chechnya’s borders, though it is technically part of the Russian Federation and therefore under their jurisdiction. The fact that it is not actually under their control drives the F.S.B. insane. It’s not hard to imagine that there is also no love lost between the F.S.B. and Prigozhin, especially given that he is affiliated with a rival security service, the G.R.U. “If Putin says execute Prigozhin, I’m sure they not only wouldn’t hesitate but that they would do it with tremendous glee,” Dobrokhotov said, of the F.S.B. “They’re just waiting for this order.”  

>Moreover, how much does Prigozhin actually control Wagner? “In Russia things like this aren’t really private,” Kofman explained. “Your money isn’t really private. The regime sees these as public resources and they can be taken away at any moment. The money isn’t his, the position isn’t his, Wagner isn’t his.” Said the former Western intelligence official, “My guess is if things went belly-up, Prigozhin’s not a big deal.” That is, it wouldn’t be a big deal to do with him what he’s done with others: nullify him.",False,1678077556.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb3mam9,,1,24,0,24,0,0,

IMO this ""threat"" (or rivalry) to the Russian MoD is exactly why Putin wants Wagner around.  Putin is, of course, paranoid.  He wants structures around him to protect his power.  Historically, the most common group to overthrow a leader is... the military.  Just recently, the domestic military overthrew the elected Egyptian government and the government in Myanmar.  History has a bunch more examples of this.  Stalin was terrified of Zhukov.  

Wagner lets Putin have this counter-balance to the Army that can prevent the Army or any general from becoming too popular because Wagner and the Army will constantly fight over who won what battle or who's fault a failure was.

She said that like all the the other elites, Prigozhin only has whatever power, influence and money that Putin wishes him to have. Putin and Prigozhin also have a history of working together in the past. He isn't considered to be a threat to Putin. Putin can just as easily take away what he's granted. The elites know that Putin is in charge and makes all the decisions.  

The fact that Prigozhin is able to speak disparagingly about others publicly regarding the war shows he currently has backing from Putin. An ordinary member of the public who tried that would have the brutal police knocking on their door.  

Julia also wrote that the private armies in Russia, such as Wagner, are granted by Putin. They know full well that Putin is really calling the shots with their private armies and can just as easily take them away.  

You do not attain anything of any meaningful degree in Russia without Putin wishing it to happen. He rewards loyalty and weeds out those perceived to be disloyal by having them murdered, imprisoned, exiled or exiled and then murdered.  

Putin is incredibly paranoid. If he thought there was a plot against him they'd be as good as dead.  

There's one other thing Julia mentioned in an interview for PBS Frontline. She said that there are far worse people than Putin in Russia who may become the next tyrant after Putin dies. It's a sobering and rather chilling thought.

His basic stance, and it makes sense, is that most PMGs are light infantry, i.e. non-mechanized or only partially mechanized because they have to depend on their employer's logistical structure for ammunition, replacement parts for equipment, etc.  He also goes into how Russian PMGs, especially Wagner, are probably Russian military affiliated, but that's besides the point right now.

Even with the increase in the size of Wagner, these new formations are still only light infantry.  And in the video Perun explains correctly that light infantry can make incremental small gains, the type we're seeing around Bahkmut, but is not capable of a war changing breakout attack.

My point is, as we've seen, the Russian is incapable of committing enough forces to a breakout attack, they just don't have the heavy units anymore (or the air superiority needed) to make one.

As overconfident as he was he would also never be so stupid as to think that NATO would ever accept attacks on their territory. He thought western resolve on Ukraine was weak and that if the invasion was already a done deal in a matter of days or weeks the west would be forced to accept a Russian controlled Ukraine. He thought there would be tensions in NATO and that the alliance would be weakened maybe, not that it would cease to exist completely.

Why would eastern European countries ever accept a no fly zone over their own country? Even if Russia took all of Ukraine they don't have any leverage to make it happen. Why did he think article 5 would just disappear? It doesn't make any sense.

Russia has destroyed various Ukrainian equipment several times over. Russia has begun fielding older and older equipment, which is what we would expect if Ukraine's claimed equipment destroyed numbers are true.

I'm sorry you know someone who was trapped in Mariupol but that doesn't have any influence on the information space. It's a war and there are a LOT of Ukrainians who are missing, and probably a large number of Russians (soldiers, mercs, prisoners) as well.

Point is - Russia has consistently been full of shit, Ukraine has been rather reliable. And yet so much of the media still gives them similar air time or written weighting... ...

Ukraine isn't even using the newly trained soldiers. I dunno all of the countries that are training Ukraine soldiers but the UK, France and the US are all training them. None of them are going to the front line when they are finished. Zelensky said last year that he knows how many soldiers he has and how many need to be trained before Ukraine goes on an offensive this year. That he is holding back all freshly trained soldiers so when they go on an offensive they have a large well rested army to conduct the offensive. I know the UK is training 10k at a time. The US has said that they are finishing training of 500 Ukraine troops per month and France is doing 2k at a time. Germany and Poland, maybe others, are training Ukraine troops on equipment. The UK is doing the same. This has been taking place since late 2022.

With all of these being trained it wouldn't be hard to believe that Ukraine is sitting on 75k or more well trained soldiers that are just waiting to go on an offensive with a large group of western equipment. That and the fact that Russia is having to already pull troops from the rest of the line to fill in weak spots mean that they are starting to have a manpower problem again.

If Wagner forces take Bakhmut, he'll use a history of comments like this to stake the position that the Russian military is incompetent and that Wagner was able to take the city even with the army failing to deliver needed supplies and ammo - and thus, the Russian people should push for more support for Wagner.

in the first six months, the Russian milbloggers were incredulous, indignant that “training officers” were being pulled first to Crimea or Belarus to lead units, then deployed to front.  That there’s no one whatsoever back in Central or Eastern military districts to train anything at all. (It’s true, everyone mobilized has gone to Southern military district for training—or no training.) That this was being done because so, so many trained specialists and officers killed.  
But then, to make it all worse, those pulled aren’t even commanding in their areas of expertise.  Which then increases likelihood they are also killed.  

Regardless, no Ukrainians go to the front with zero training.  (Although, I’ve read 1st hand testimonies of soldiers who went with inadequate training or experience, [like this one](https://www-pravda-com-ua.translate.goog/articles/2023/02/5/7387851/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui).)
 But by and large, Ukraine endeavors to train the men for the roles they’ll be performing. Which makes them a more qualified 1 in the 3.5:1.

Actually, when consider that Russians aren’t trained adequately, their numerical superiority is lessened somewhat.  Like from 3.5 to 1 down to 3 to one.  Or at least 3.2 to one.",1678138610.0,1678138174.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb6olfk,,2,19,0,19,0,0,
043c155ba5cc328b5b19963ca0ed0254,11jns6n,jb6yad9,"I think there's another important and far harder to quantify part of the population equation that skews things in Ukraine's favour.

Within any pool of conscripted population there will be a huge variance in raw quality both in terms of physical and mental attributes and motivation. There will be some A graders (ie intelligent, physically fit people who want to fight) and then a spectrum of older or less fit people and motivations ranging from 'I'm prepared to do my part' to 'I don't want to be here but I'll follow orders' 'I just want to get through this alive' and 'fuck this I'm deserting/surrendering at the first opportunity'. You can do some things with lower quality troops but in terms of how well training sticks, how they react under fire, how capable they are when attacking, the difference between a reasonably well motivated soldier and a malingerer is light years.

For Ukrainians for the vast majority of their population this is a war of national survival. Even if they absolutely hate being a soldier and are scared every minute, they are fighting to prevent things (the end of their country, their hometowns, their loved ones murdered or raped, their kids deported to Russia) that are so horrific that it's an entirely rational choice for them to risk their life fighting for their country..hell, because of the constant targeting of civilians by russia many will already have suffered personal loss and want revenge. 

Against that russian manpower have some vaguely defined, constantly shifting goals about fighting nazism/satanism/lbtq issues/NATO/hunter biden's secret biowarfare labs/the donbas whatever. Some will swallow enough of the propaganda to be useful but plenty of the smart ones already fled the country before conscription hit and at the end of the day even the most pig stupid conscript can't fail to appreciate that if they go home the war ends. So for most it's probably just about getting through this alive.
 
I think once you factor in the smart russians fleeing their country and the huge difference in motivation the manpower difference probably evens up or slightly skews in Ukraine's favour. The reason there are such lopsided casualty ratios is there is only so much you can do with terrified uncomprehending conscripts against an intelligent well motivated citizen army fighting for national survival.",1678140894.0,1678140529.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb6olfk,,2,14,0,14,0,0,

I think you might be right about the ""killzone"".   I don't have a complete picture and have never been there but the description is a low farm field below hills further west.  Sniper blinds in the Bakhmut ruin skyline look down on the farm field.  If Ukraine built east-west communication trenches they offer very little protection for Russian troops that temporarily occupy them.  

I'm not convinced that the word ""pincer"" is appropriate in cases where an entire maneuver takes place underneath artillery range.  M777 howitzers in the hills can shoot all the way across to the east side of Bakhmut.  If we zoom in the map the front line has the pincer appearance.  

It could be a friendly fire nightmare.  Well trained and highly disciplined troops might be able to devastate an opponent in this type of field.  A SEAL team could come and go from Bakhmut freely.  Perhaps kill a few Russian and replace antipersonnel mines while passing through each time.

In the late 60's, along with the wave of anti-vietnam protests, and civil rights protests in the US, youth in Germany called for, among other important things, an end to the ""Embarassed Silence"" regarding the Holocaust.

In 1978, the telecast ""Holocaust -  The Story of the Family Weiss"" was broadcast, depicting persecution and genocide of the Jews during WWII. It marked the beginning of the real end of silence regarding the Holocaust, sparking a national effort to take ownership of their dark past.

> Russia uses lancet drones which are similar. Some people say that the Switchblade 600 is like a javelin missile in terms it's top attack function.

Unlikely. The flightpath of the Javelin is computerized and automated. A rocket flying at 500mph is just going to be different than a drone flying at 120mph.

Still, with the same explosive power as a Javelin, the Switchblade 600 probably can destroy tanks reliably. The warhead has a significant amount of penetration, so even if its not 100% the weakest point of enemy tanks, its still probably going to destroy it.

But a rocket is just innately more maneuverable than a drone. The drone will be slower and probably less maneuverable. However, the drone can loiter for a longer period of time, and also provides cameras for scouting information during its loiter period.

I've heard of more Switchblade 300s being used than 600, possibly because the cameras / scouting information is way more important than the Javelin warhead (which is heavy and hampers its use). IIRC, you can carry like 6x Switchblade 300s in one backpack, but the same backpack can only carry 1x Switchblade 600, because the warhead is just so big.

So 6x camera systems / drones is more useful to a typical soldier than 1x anti-tank drone, typically anyway.",1678128023.0,1678127681.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb61hgh,,3,16,0,16,0,0,

>It is also not quite clear how Wagner really came to fruition. Was it Prigozhin’s own idea? Was it Putin’s? Was it the military’s or the G.R.U.’s? It seems it was a combination, and by February 2014, Wagner fighters appeared as auxiliary “little green men” in Crimea. That spring, they sprouted up on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine as “volunteers” and “separatists” in what Russia continued to claim, however implausibly, was a Ukrainian civil war in which Russia played absolutely no role. Wagner’s commander was a man named Dmitry Utkin, a retired officer of the G.R.U., or Russian military intelligence. (According to some reports, it was Utkin’s fondness for German culture that earned the group the moniker Wagner, after the composer, and their fighters the nickname “musicians.”) Wagner’s military supplies allegedly came from the Russian Ministry of Defense. And their money allegedly came from, or rather through, Prigozhin’s catering business, Concord. 

>First, Prigozhin allegedly muscled his partner out of the business, then pushed him out of the market by seemingly (non-fatally) poisoning a banquet he was catering to various high-placed St. Petersburg functionaries. Korotkov, who reported on the event, said that after ambulances were called, it was over for Prigozhin’s competitor. “That’s how they started, joking around; they weren’t killing anyone yet. Just poisoning banquets, spreading cockroaches in hospitals, et cetera,” Korotkov said of Prigozhin and his people. “Then they started breaking limbs.”

>Soon, using his Kremlin connections, Prigozhin, who was now known as “Putin’s chef,” started getting massive state contracts worth tens of billions of rubles—as well as billions in financing from state banks—to feed the military, the police, and school children. Much of this money went right through his catering company to fund projects that were far more interesting to the Kremlin, like Wagner and the Internet Research Agency, also known as the “troll farm.” This project was a key part of the Russian government’s efforts to influence American presidential elections, for which Prigozhin and a dozen of the agency’s employees were indicted by Robert Mueller in 2018.

Once HIMARS arrived and the front lines stabilized it meant Ukraine could keep their poorly trained forces back and only send well trained troops into combat. 

Overall expending blood is more politically costly to Russia than expending ammo or military hardware however as the hardware and ammo falls for Russia they will be forced to expend more and more blood and as you pointed out the decision to send Russian trainers into combat has likely only hurt them.

Aside from fighting our friends which we don’t want to do in the first place Problem with fighting Europe would not be gaining ground but what to do with it when we gained it. I think the US formula for occupation is one soldier for every 40 residents of a given area and Europe right now has some ~750million people. That’s twice our actual population. So assuming even civilian casualties of 10% (which is considered decimation) that’s still ~675 million which would take something like 15 million soldiers to occupy. Not even we with our bloated military budget have that many. 

Our current military strength with all branches is currently about 3 million military personnel with about 500K of those in our army.

Never mind the front lines and attrition there against a force of modern nations with really good motivations to fight back. 

Not to mention it’s not just a matter of breaking the continent and calling it a day. As we gained ground we’d have to occupy territory leaving sizable occupation forces along the way, along with that supply lines across an ocean. 😵‍💫

Cars came far after and most people live in cities and suburbs-- perfect for walking, biking, public transportation. We 'need' cars because we designed our cities (really the suburbs post WWII) for cars, making it an absolute nightmare to get by without one.

Cars only exist because of government subsidies to hide the true cost of cars-- look at any highway project, road project, the costs are astronomical (not to include all the negative externalities like micro plastic from car tires, exhaust pollution).

Rail works. You have a trunk/main line and branch lines everywhere. From the trainstops you have walkable, bikable, busable cities and suburbs.

Same concept works for industry too. Short branches from a mainline are efficient, can delivery far more, far faster and with less labor than highway trucking.

What do you think we did during the industrial revolution? Check out some of these old maps before passenger service was discontinued for just one of the railroads in the area.

They called somewhere...were told something like, “better find a hiding spot, we got incoming too, we’ll be there later, stay alive.”  Sorta a nightmare scenario.  Then ended up hiding in a cellar, two groups off Russians approach, hours apart, and toss grenades into the cellar, and due to a comedy of errors, none of the Ukrainians (5 of them in cellar) are killed.

In another article someone (a Chechen journalist whose name isn't given for their safety) Julia interviewed said that Kadyrov was offended by being left out of a prisoner swap:  
>The second theory is a little more complicated and harder to prove. It is that Kadyrov was extremely slighted when there was this prisoner exchange in which [Putin crony] Viktor Medvedchuk was swapped for Ukrainian prisoners, and there were a couple American prisoners in the mix. One of the negotiators was Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. Kadyrov apparently didn’t like that because his traditional role was to be the go-between between Russia and the Arab world. And here he wasn’t asked, he was totally ignored. Apparently, he was very offended by that.  

As for the FSB and Kadyrov:  
>Kadyrov has long exploited the myth of the Chechen warrior, made famous in the West by the Chechens’ fierce resistance to Russian colonization in the 18th century, and then by their fight for independence in the 1990s, brutally repressed by Putin in his rise to power. That myth is tinged with a lot of fear and racism, both in Russia and Ukraine, as well as in the West, but it is also one of the keys to Kadyrov’s hold on his throne. He took power as the head of the Chechen Republic in 2007, after two savage wars, the latter of which became a never-ending series of Russian counter-terrorism operations. Countless Chechens disappeared and it bred a Chechen insurgency that reached deep into Russia with terrorist attacks. Kadyrov, with the help of Kremlin money and firepower, was able to quell the restive republic, ruling it through sheer terror. Indeed, he has terrorized people both inside Chechnya (where any dissenters are hunted down with ghastly efficiency and punished, as are their relatives) and outside of it (the reach of the almighty F.S.B., for example, stops at the Chechen border).",False,1678086159.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb3yg6e,,5,3,0,3,0,0,

https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/urban-rural-populations.html

More people live in urban areas in the West than the Northeast-- traditionally seen as dense with some of the best rail corridors in the US. I'm not advocating for the elimination of cars as transportation methods, but I will confidently say that the idea that we need cars because the US has wide open spaces is false. Just because ~11% of the west lives in rural settings doesn't mean that the other ~89% should also use cars (or really worse, SUVs and trucks in suburban and urban areas).

We built our suburbs for cars, not people, and I think that's why you think we need cars. We can shift this development model, build spaces people first, build mixed use spaced and end R-1 zoning (or really most zoning all together check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNe9C866I2s).

It's not easy shifting our minds to accept that maybe we can't just hop in our movable couch and park right in front of a store, but it's a mindset that we need to change. I've been car free for over a year, and sure, it's difficult, I have to walk more, take transit, and things take longer but I'm healthier and I don't have to waste money on fuel and cause the environment more harm.

1. Communicate through backchannels that any nuclear launch ordered by Putin would end very poorly for Russia -- they pop one tactical nuke, they get a full counter-force strike. Anything bigger, they're still getting the same response. Not attacking population centers, just removing all silos, sub bases, bomber bases from the map.

Kasparov recently said that people should stop caring about what Putin wants. When a reporter started to mention nukes Kasparov asked hasn't Putin caused enough carnage already and what could possibly be worse than all the people who have already died because of him.

Kasparov said that at the moment there is a degree of isolation between the Russian people and the war. They see what the Kremlin allows them to see, but it's this far away thing that isn't directly hurting them and making them feel vulnerable and publicly questioning Putin.

There is a reason why brutality is used to deter people, because it's very effective, even against the most resilient people. For example in a mafia or criminal structure, brutality is used to control people who don't like to be controlled. Who have no morale, no values, no anything, and yet brutality works on them.

This is because while brutality can be talked about and deformed with words, it has a very strong and real impact on our brains when you have to directly face it. This is also used in the animal world and even is a strong factor of evolution. So while I understand your viewpoint, your words and emotions might hide the crude reality.

I think our own strength is to understand this factor and address it with our own tools. To understand it, we can't just ignore it or deform it, we have to truly accept that it exists.

This was for example an issue with serial killers. At first we only claimed that they are crazy people and that was all. We were inefficient in dealing with them. Police was dismissing the cases, did not build any tools to counteract it and people just lived in fear because the issue was ignored. We thought that ignoring the deep aspect of it and just deform its nature was enough to avoid the issue, but it was wrong.

The film they watched was called The Day After (1983). You may find [this section on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After#Effects_on_policymakers) interesting. It talks about the effect watching The Day After had on people.  

If you're interested why not try and find out if there's an old bunker opened to the public as a museum near where you live.",False,1678153282.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb78l3y,,9,2,0,2,0,0,

Looks like the first railroad there was built back in 1895!

Passenger rail isn't used because cars and their roads and highways are subsidized.

I just want to stress, I'm not against your lifestyle or the desire to own a car. I just believe we need to offer people real options and offer competition to the car. I don't want to own a car, but unfortunately that means I can only live in a few geographically limited areas in the US and I think that's absolutely tragic. Let's rebuild our cities and our social fabric. Humans are designed to walk and move. Cars are a weird aberration and we're not designed to live this way as social creatures.",1678153761.0,1678153460.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb7qcmp,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Thank you for your intelligent responses. I didn’t finish reading the Jerome railway story to see if it is still working today, but that would be a scary ride up that mountainside. I hate the thought of even driving up the 89 into that town. Done it twice and that’s too much.

On the other hand, I hope world leaders won't let Putin get away with all this out of fear for what he may do. If he's allowed to get away with things then any would-be dictator will do exactly the same. We know dictators copy what works from each other just the same as world leaders and politicians copy from each other.  

It's like Kasparov said, we all need to stop thinking about what Putin wants or what he may do. Instead the world needs to do what's right and do it quickly.",False,1678157037.0,t3_11jns6n,t1_jb7vf3i,,2,2,0,2,0,0,
