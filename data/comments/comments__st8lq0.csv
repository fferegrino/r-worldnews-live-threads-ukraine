The other thing is, we have no fucking idea what's going to happen, so it's pointless to pretend like we have it all figured out.",False,1644961617.0,t3_st8lq0,t3_st8lq0,,0,47,0,47,0,0,

I figure I’d chime in with a few indicators because I’m seeing a ton of people on flight radar.

You’re going to be looking for a mass influx of IL-76s to a few select locations. So far I haven’t heard much about VDV amassing at airfields yet, but I’d expect to see it occur around the time the aerial campaign begins. You also probably won’t see their shit rigged for a drop on Twitter/TikTok. It can happen in hours in garrison. Ivanovo, Pskov, Tula, Ryazan, Kostroma is where you’d likely see them come from.

VKS will likely go dark before shit gets real.

You won’t be seeing Russia establish air superiority in real time with flight radar- UKR would be a complete no-fly zone for all commercial air and VKS transponders would be off. EW equipment would also be active.

Edit: just saw Estonian intelligence say 1 Russian VDV Division is deployed. Pretty sure they have 5 divisions and 3 or 4 further separate brigades they can call on.

I'm dying for the situation to be resolved asap. Too much pressure. 
Most people here do not believe the war is imminent though. As of climate, I guess there are some trigger-happy folks, but any average citizen with two brain cells isn't happy with the idea of their relative/friend/spouse returning in a zinc coffin. Or their livelihood deteriorating.
Average citizen enjoys their iPhone, travelling, goods and international technology. And doesn't like when national currency is worth a sweet wrapper.
Also, rn I'm kinda relying on one particular drug really popular in the US. I'm sweating just thinking of supply shortage. There would be non-combatant people dying without medicine. Tragic.

PS. Media is just like any other media, portraying only one side of events. Younger generation doesn't watch TV that much, and is heavily integrated in western pop culture. Nowadays you wouldn't be as successful recruiting cannon fodder as in 20th century. Yeah, we've got some fancy weapons, but we also got the shortest male lifespan in Europe.

PPS. I personally don't like Putin's warmongering, but I see situation isn't just black and white. It's that our diplomacy is so damn piss poor we can't get anything out of our counterparts without sabre rattling... Le sad.

3. China takes Taiwan preferably through no conflict but conflict if need be.

4. China uses Taiwan to completely lock down the south China sea, and cuts off all trade routes for Japan from the west.

5. Japan joins a treaty with China and Russia.

6. Germany drops from the EU to follow their economic interests with China and Russia. Leaving the EU deeply in debt to the new economic regime consisting of Germany, Russia, China, and Japan.

7. Then with a weak EU and with Africa, South America, on their side, China, Russia, Germany, and Japan, attack the US or at the very least start pressing the US economically into submission with sanctions until they provoke an attack from the US.

Once the Russians take control of the region and dig in, there is no way the Ukrainian army is going to be beat the Russians back. Russia will control the air, making it very hard for Ukrainian armor to do much of anything. Also the area of land Russia is going to take is near the Black Sea where the Russian navy has an entire fleet of warships. These naval assets are capable of launching missiles that can help Russian ground forces in Ukraine. 

I think we will see a very short but bloody war, once the Russians dig in and Ukraine starts losing lot of lives and equipment they will negotiate a ceasefire.

Russians sow divisions based on ethnic and political lines, fund opposition groups, news sources, and fake activist organizations, and now employ troll farms and bot swarms.  Eventually leverage any cracks that emerge.  At some point though, you need to get the local population to consent, likely under duress.  

1. Grievances and Othering and Distrust in institutions set the stage
2. An event comes that looks like the bad guys are oppressing the good (pro Russian) guys--such as claims of genocide, political oppression or terrorism in recent cases
3. Get an invitation from locals to help intervene 

Stuffing the local area with outsiders helps a lot (notice how Russian media claims they've lost 6 Russian citizen soldiers recently to Ukranian fire inside of Ukraine territory).  Stuffing with armed forces / little green men helps with inviting fighting (conflict that shows the Ukrainian gov't has lost control or the locals want out) and intimidation as political resolutions are proposed.  

Recognizing a local area as independent helps too.  Russia just did that again. 

**The key is, in my mind, that Eastern Ukraine itself is not so strategically important (like Crimea arguably is).  But notice how** it is shaking the confidence and allegiances of NATO members, and will certainly invite political trouble for all members, and shows how weak the West is because they aren't willing to shed blood and resources for small causes. It makes civilians of those govts think again about what values the country stands for and what their military and government can do.  

The exact same process is underway, certainly with different final steps, all across the West. 

PS also it keeps nations like Ukraine into active border conflict and thus ineligible for NATO membership.  If a square km of a breakaway region can persist for 30 years, then Ukraine cannot join in that time period.   

PPS the cost-benefit calculation also changes as things evolve.  Imagine no occupation but lots of conflict over the next 12-48 months.  Draining Ukraine's money and energy, pitting Ukrainians against Ukrainians, not knowing who to trust...nothing getting done politically, crackdowns on civil liberties due to war, etc...  Is more chaos favorable to Russia?  Would it enhance the willingness of local groups to ask for Russian help or pursue breakaway movements?  He doesn't need to pull a WWII invasion for that to happen.  

There are many benefits and few costs if you think of it not as a real ground invasion with an aim to hold Ukraine but instead as a kind of demonstration and proxy war, with benefits.  Though who knows, maybe he is dead serious about invading Ukraine in this winter window and holding it.

Maybe Russia is just conducting a +150k strong combined army/navy/airforce exercise a short drive from the Ukrainian frontier...  But they've also built field hospitals and barracks. They've repositioned fuel reserves along with huge amounts of armor, artillery, earth moving equipment, helicopters and all other sorts of material to the boarder.

Edit: copying my reply to a response asking for sources:
>why would the governments of nations that were thriving in a capitalist system enter into a war with their European trading partners and disrupt these profitable businesses? One argument is that European governments didn’t want to go to war at all. Many business and finance experts also believed that their governments wouldn’t want a war. British journalist Norman Angell wrote in his book The Great Illusion, first published in 1910, that European powers would be financially devastated if they entered into a war with each other. He said it was ""because of the internationalization and delicate interdependence of our credit-built finance and industry"" (Angell, 31). In other words, the economies of the nations of the world at the start of the twentieth century were already intricately woven in economic interdependence (what we would today call globalization or interconnection). If Europe went to war, then the financial systems built upon this interdependence would crumble. World markets would then crash and businesses that relied on capitalist systems would be devastated.

On another article from the Economist who actually reported during the first world war.
>The leading European nation that was the most reluctant to join the war was Britain, the centre of finance and world trade; so much so the French were close to despair >that Britian might back out of the alliance. And if anyone was urging the Britons to war, it was not the titans of finance. The Economist itself, which back then described itself as a ""weekly commercial times, bankers' gazette and railway monitor"" thundered against war. On August 1 (three days before Britain's entry), we fumed against the attempts of the yellow Press and of the Times to drive the government into a European war saying that the quarrel is no more of our making and no more of our concern than would be a quarrel between Argentina and Brazil or between China and Japan

>The next article was designed to give our readers some faint notion of the extent of the financial calamity which has suddenly overtaken Europe and the world...the financial world has been staggering under a series of blows such as the delicate system of international credit has never before witnessed, or even imagined. A week later, Britain had joined the war but the Economist's writers had hardly been overcome with a fit of patriotic fervour, bemoaning the disasters which have befallen manufacturers, merchants, shipowners and shopkeepers in all parts of the country.

 >The Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-blade, twin-engine, medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the United States Army's Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the YUH-60A and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the Boeing Vertol YUH-61. Named after the Native American war leader Black Hawk, the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the Bell UH-1 Iroquois as the Army's tactical transport helicopter.

Put the shoe on the other foot.

What if China and Russia created a new alliance that specifically existed to fight the US.  They get 28 other countries to join including Canada and they park a bunch of missiles pointed at the US in Canada. 

Then they play a massive part in a coup d'etat in 2014 in Mexico to oust a government sympathetic or not aggressive to the US, then begin funding and supporting neo Nazis in Mexico and continually aggrevate the US by sanctioning them via the UN.  Then, say the Yucatan peninsula democratically votes to become part of California and the US accepts and then pushes some troops into Yucatan to dissuade Chinese/Russian forces from taking it back on behalf of Mexico.  

Then Mexico announces it wants to join this alliance against the US.  Should the US just say ""ok, good show guys!""

Get fucking real.  Everybody that thinks the US is in the right here has only ever heard one side of this story and it's full of fucking holes.  It's nonsensical and ridiculous on every level.  I swear, some people see the world with the nuance of a fucking Superman comic book.

One argument is that European governments didn’t want to go to war at all. Many business and finance experts also believed that their governments wouldn’t want a war. British journalist Norman Angell wrote in his book The Great Illusion, first published in 1910, that European powers would be financially devastated if they entered into a war with each other. He said it was ""because of the internationalization and delicate interdependence of our credit-built finance and industry"" (Angell, 31). In other words, the economies of the nations of the world at the start of the twentieth century were already intricately woven in economic interdependence (what we would today call globalization or interconnection). If Europe went to war, then the financial systems built upon this interdependence would crumble. World markets would then crash and businesses that relied on capitalist systems would be devastated.

On another article from the Economist who actually reported during the first world war.
>The leading European nation that was the most reluctant to join the war was Britain, the centre of finance and world trade; so much so the French were close to despair >that Britian might back out of the alliance. And if anyone was urging the Britons to war, it was not the titans of finance. The Economist itself, which back then described >itself as a ""weekly commercial times, bankers' gazette and railway monitor"" thundered against war. On August 1 (three days before Britain's entry), we fumed against

    >the attempts of the yellow Press and of the Times to drive the government into a European war saying that the quarrel is no more of our making and no more of our concern than would be a quarrel between Argentina and Brazil or between China and Japan

>The next article was designed to give our readers some faint notion of the extent of the financial calamity which has suddenly overtaken Europe and the world...the financial world has been staggering under a series of blows such as the delicate system of international credit has never before witnessed, or even imagined. A week later, Britain had joined the war but the Economist's writers had hardly been overcome with a fit of patriotic fervour, bemoaning the disasters which have befallen manufacturers, merchants, shipowners and shopkeepers in all parts of the country.

>This was the end of the first great era of globalisation. It would be the 1980s before the world was so open again. The Economist warned that

    >Death, anguish, starvation and despair are written over western Europe...It is the triumph of diplomacy over common sense, or force over reason, of brutality over >humanity

Ukraine will take it. That's all they can do and their preparations seem to be well ahead of my opinion. They are preparing for a worst case scenario of a full invasion and making it costly due to the disparity in equipment. 

Neither nation can afford large losses with an already declining and aging population. So no nukes, no full scale war. Just Russia pushing boundaries a few more inches and saying if they get hit back they will unleash nuclear hell. Its pretty typical theatre just taken up a notch. 

Then in the end Putin will say Russia bested the West and pushed back having claimed the separatist regions and if opportunity allows a few extra ""cheap"" peaces of land.

The world will condemn them (mostly) but breathe a little easier when they agree to stop with out Nato stepping in. Artillery and border skirmishes will keep people occupied for years to come and Russians and Ukrainians will all be the worse off.

Everyone wants dollars and Euros!!  They can't even figure out an equitable way to trade in their depressed currencies (I'd predict it'd go forward in Yuan as China has a veritable smorgasbord of goods to sell).  And let's not forget what the pandemic has taught us all (world wide) that reliance on China is a dangerous and stupid situation to be in.  We likely will bring home key industries even if we have to subsidize them (from microchips to feedstock chemicals).  I would imagine Europe will also.

 >Hear, hear is an expression used as a short, repeated form of hear him/her. It represents a listener's agreement with the point being made by a speaker. It was originally an imperative for directing attention to speakers, and has since been used, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, as ""the regular form of cheering in the House of Commons"", with many purposes, depending on the intonation of its user. Its use in Parliament is linked to the fact that applause is normally (though not always) forbidden in the chambers of the House of Commons and House of Lords.

That said, I agree with you. While we cannot be everywhere, the US is the largest reason for relative peace among developed nations since WWII. Certainly we have to debate cost and morality, but the US has, at least mostly, been in the right.

I think Trump was wrong to even suggest leaving NATO, but hyperbole has always been his favorite form of communication. At the end of the day, everybody knew he was simply saying that the US should not be so overweighted in NATO, which is a reasonable and debatable position.

The real clear aggregator includes liberal polls from  CNN, MSNBC, and huffington post as well as republican polls from Trafalgar and Fox. 

No matter which way you try to spin it Biden’s approval is in the toilet at the moment. It doesn’t matter that Trump has better approvals currently, or what his rating was at this time during his respective presidency. That’s whataboutism. We’re talking Biden’s objective overall favorability which is about 2 points lower than Trump. That’s objectively factual at the moment

There's already a lot of pushback and the bloodier it is the worse the international response would be. I also imagine they want to maintain as much infrastructure and industry as they can. They value Ukraine, they're not trying to lay waste to it. They want an outcome similar to the Taliban retaking Afghanistan, hoping that the country collapses like a house of cards. Ukraine has been prepping the citizens to fight back and to maintain an insurgency if the government falls, and if they're successful and the citizens have the will it's just going to be even bloodier.",1644974037.0,1644973647.0,t3_st8lq0,t1_hx408uh,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

The most alarming thing to me has been the accusations that Ukraine is committing genocide. There are concerning aspects from the military buildup but those could indeed be training excercises, but you don't start selling justification just for training exercises. We discussed wrongdoings from the US in the past, so to draw examples, you don't generally tell the world or your people that a country has weapons of mass destruction or have an ambassador's daughter claim soldiers killed babies just so you can deploy 150,000 troops, some over thousands of miles, just so you can send them home. That being said if they're going so far as to accuse Ukraine of genocide as part of an effort to trick the west, it's worked and it may strain NATO relationships and it has already damaged Ukraine. However, it's also meant that Ukraine has gotten significantly more aid than they were getting just months ago, which is a bad outcome if they genuinely ever want to conquer the country. Maybe that doesn't matter to them, they know it's not like Ukraine would invade Russia. The reality is Russia has an incredibly advanced intelligence system and its difficult to truly be sure with anything.",False,1644975282.0,t3_st8lq0,t1_hx437vd,,4,2,0,2,0,0,
