Day 150 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet again, quieter than yesterday, as today we didn’t get shelled. Turns out that yesterday they shelled yet another university, it wasn’t damaged much, but many windows broke. Just why are they so obsessed with destroying educational institutions? They also shelled someone’s house, 1 person was injured, but thankfully nobody died. 

The missiles were launched at 3:30am today, just 2 of them, and they also aimed them at Chuhuiv again, they have been shelling it for over a week now. It’s weird how they fixate on some specific town, and then shell it for weeks straight. They did that same thing before with Merefa, I think around 2 months ago, which they’ve been shelling for a couple of weeks with everything they could reach it with.

That missile strike aimed at Odesa port today was not exactly unexpected, but I also don’t really understand why Russia would want to make itself look even worse than they already do. They are basically saying “you can never trust us”, which was already known, but they are reaffirming it even further. 

Them also saying that they didn’t fire those missiles was especially funny, they are the only ones who use Kalibrs, and we don’t even have any cruise missiles to fire, so they can’t say that it was a false flag. Apparently later one of their officials said that they did fire them, but that they were aiming at Harpoon launchers. So which is it? Why can they never stick to just one story, and have to change it all the time?

Also about the time I post my updates, it is definitely weird, mostly because sleeping at night is basically impossible since the start of the war. They have been conducting their shelling and missile strikes later in the day, it was 8pm in the first 2 months, then 11pm in the third and fourth months, and now it’s like 2-4am. So it gets progressively harder to sleep the longer the war goes on.  

Some people just ignore all the missiles flying over, or landing in the city and sleep anyway, their mindset is basically “if I die, then it’s fate”, but I feel pretty uncomfortable sleeping during missile strikes, it’s better to always be prepared for anything.

🪖 On Friday, **NO SUBSTANTIAL TERRITORY CHANGED HANDS**.   Despite this, you can feel the momentum shifting towards Ukraine with the russian occupied town of Vysokopillya near Kherson either encircled or [caught in a cauldron](https://twitter.com/mdmitri91/status/1550574757543911425), with [a report](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPR/status/1550586379859640320) of russia petitioning for a green corridor.  Regardless, the usual suspects [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1550617961966206979), [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550436748072738817.html), and [Andrew](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550651738935410689.html) will guide you through all the battles of the day.

🍄 Ukraine is still busy [destroying](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550437581258735616.html) russian [ammo dumps](https://twitter.com/by_Ukraine/status/1550673228217171968), bases, and [command posts](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua/status/1550622544247627776)! 

🚀 Some bad news today as, the US is not ready to supply Ukraine long range ATACMS HIMARS munitions said [Jake Sullivan](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/1550558455798370304) at a security conference in Aspen.

🚀 russia is increasingly using air-defense S-300 rockets in a [ground attack role](https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1550355179622600704). While technically the S-300 [was designed](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1549169658061901824.html) to also be a ground-to-ground system, russia’s use of these rockets may indicate a growing shortage of other, more specialized, ground-to ground systems.

🌾 Today, Ukraine, Turkey, the UN, and russia [signed agreements](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550505492186910722.html) to allow for the [safe passage](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550521975034060806.html) of Ukrainian grain shipments from three ports in Ukraine.  russia and Ukraine [separately signed agreements](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550434640585949186.html) with the UN and Turkey to get the deal enacted.  And here's some analysis on [what it all means](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550537176592822272.html).

🎁 The US [officially announced](https://twitter.com/AlaskaOutpost/status/1550646518775889921) another round of [weapons for Ukraine](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550535685932605440.html), included were the already announced HIMARS systems, 36k rounds of artillery, and 580 Ghost Drones.

🎁 The German Iris-T air defense system is still in production and will be sent to Ukraine at the end [of the summer](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550351136426758145).

💰The port of Rotterdam announced it is no longer accepting russian ships.  And there is a report russia’s economy is [imploding](https://twitter.com/780thC/status/1550637610560671744)

👉 Transnistria is in the news again today as Moldova prohibits russia from using it’s territory to [rotate troops](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1550396790381363205) out of the occupied territory.  Transnistria says it intends to [join russia](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1550368718399619072) which would make it an exclave of the federation.  And [Ukraine told Moldova](https://mobile.twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550545539044876290) it would be happy to help rid Transnistria of russian troops.

👉 russia has [blocked Google](https://twitter.com/UaBabel/status/1550422770768650242) in the occupied territories.  And like Ukraine’s grain, russia is looting [Ukraine’s steel](https://twitter.com/GlasnostGone/status/1550381855299469312)

🥷 It’s not just partisan attacks in the south of Ukraine, ordinary Ukrainians are [refusing to work](https://twitter.com/pravda_eng/status/1550480788948410373) for russian occupation forces.

🔥 Gas is back in news today as Hungary [successfully negotiated](https://twitter.com/vtchakarova/status/1550240226467094529) an increased supply from russia.  In good news, we have some figures that show the EU has [substantially decreased](https://twitter.com/jakluge/status/1550505968198459392) its use of russian gas and all the more impressive as the cost of gas has gone up so much since the invasion.   As one of the, very few successes russia is having, russian propaganda is ratcheted up [to the max](https://twitter.com/francis_scarr/status/1550468003598319616).

☢️ We got [some video](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1550606162797674499) of Ukrainian drone strikes on russians at the occupied Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant.

More reaction now on reports Russia has bombarded infrastructure in the Black Sea port of Odesa - a day after agreeing to resume grain exports.

Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, has ""unequivocally condemned"" the reported strikes.

He said: ""Yesterday, all parties made clear commitments on the global stage to ensure the safe movement of Ukrainian grain and related products to global markets. 

""These products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe.

""Full implementation by the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Turkey is imperative.""

Foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell added: ""EU strongly condemns Russian missile strike on Odesa's seaport. 

""Striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of Istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible & again demonstrates Russia's total disregard for international law & commitments.""

Following a call between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a Downing Street spokeswoman said the UK is working to expand its efforts to train Ukrainian troops.

The statement said: ""The Prime Minister outlined the recent steps the UK has taken to bolster Ukraine's resistance, including training thousands of Ukrainian troops in the UK. The UK is working to expand this training effort, including through the involvement of international partners.""

It added that Mr Zelenskyy had said military support from the UK and others is making a real difference in the conflict. 

Ukrainian soldiers have received weapons training in the UK in a bid to strengthen its forces against Russia. 

Ukraine's deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has also met soldiers training in the UK during a visit.

""It's not something that would be executed in the near-term,"" Kirby said.

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,w5ualx,ihabdfk,"Russia may be forced to pull out of key city within days, top expert predicts

Dr Mike Martin, visiting fellow in war studies at King's College London, has suggested that the Russians may not be able to spend much longer defending the strategically key city of Kherson - and may be forced to pull out within the next week or so.

It has been the location of some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict, but the prominent expert predicts Putin could frame a withdrawal by his forces as a ""goodwill"" gesture in the next 10 days.

It is operationally important to the Russians, due to its access to Crimea, and its position north and west of the Dnipro river.

Saying the war was currently ""at a very interesting point"", Dr Martin pointed to operational pauses to fighting in the Donbas.

Now, Ukraine has been using pauses in fighting as Russia regroups to hit back at Moscow's troops, striking command centres and control posts with western-donated weaponry in Kherson.

Ukraine has also been hitting supply drops and bridges, slowing Russia's access into Kherson.

And he says Kyiv's relatively recent access to longer range missile systems means Russia will now have to move its supply dumps back considerably, so they are beyond the range of Ukrainian strikes.

""It means that Russia, who rely on a very artillery heavy way of fighting war (and artillery is the most logistics intensive thing ever), can probably no longer get enough supplies up to the front line to conduct offensives; they can probably only defend on the Kherson front now,"" he says.

Dr Martin's adds: ""If I were a Russian soldier in Kherson I would be pretty scared right now.""

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said a cease-fire with Russia without reclaiming the lost lands would only prolong the war.

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), he warned that a cease-fire that allows Russia to keep Ukrainian territories seized since the invasion in February would only encourage an even wider conflict, giving Moscow abadly-needed opportunity to replenish and rearm for the next round.

""Freezing the conflict with the Russian Federation means a pause that gives the Russian Federation a break for rest,"" the WSJ reported, citing comments by Mr Zelenskyy.

In the interview he also added that while Western supplied HIMARS, artillery rocket systems, were making a material difference, his country needs more to turn the tide.

As we've been reporting this afternoon, Ukraine has noted Russian strikes on the Black Sea port of Odesa this morning.

It comes around 24 hours after the two warring nations agreed to ensure the ""safe movement of Ukrainian grain"" from the southern city.

Now, Mykhailo Podolyak - an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy - has accused Russia of being ""predictably worthless"".

He said: ""The ink has not had time to dry out, yet there are two vile provocations: attack on a sea port in Odessa and a statement by Russian Defense Ministry that Ukrainian ports are 'dangerous for shipping'.

It was claimed in the last hour that the damage was minimal, and it did not impact any grain storage areas in the southern city. 

No casualties were immediately reported.

Mr Zelenskyy said the bombardment demonstrates that Moscow would always find a way not to implement the grain deal struck with the UN, Turkey and Ukraine. 

""This proves only one thing: no matter what Russia says and promises, it will find ways not to implement it,"" he added.

He added: ""The Russian missile is Vladimir Putin's spit in the face of UN Secretary General António Guterres and President of Turkey Recep Erdogan, who made enormous efforts to reach an agreement, and to whom Ukraine is grateful.

Ukraine claims it struck a bridge in the occupied Black Sea region of Kherson on Saturday - targeting a key Russian supply route.

It comes as Kyiv prepares for a major counter-offensive in the war with Moscow, which has reached a 150th day.

The strike hit the Daryivskyi bridge across the Ingulets river used for supplies by Russian troops, days after a major bridge over the nearby Dnieper was hit, said an adviser to the region's governor. 

""Every bridge is a weak point for logistics and our armed forces are skilfully destroying the enemy system. This is not yet the liberation of Kherson, but a serious preparatory step in that direction,"" Serhiy Khlan said. 

The deputy head of the Russian-installed regional authority said the bridge had been hit by seven rockets from Western-supplied high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS), Russia's TASS news agency said. 

Despite this, it was claimed that the bridge was still in use.

Ukraine has been using Western-supplied long-range weapons to hit Russian supply lines and ammunition dumps in an effort to turn the tide in the war and prepare a counter-offensive in Kherson region.

The MoD says ""heavy fighting"" had taken placed in the last 48 hours as Ukrainian forces continue their offensive against Russia in Kherson province, west of the Dnipro River.

It added that Russian forces are using artillery fire along the Inhulets River, a tributary of the Dnipro.

""Supply lines of the Russian forces west of the river are increasingly at risk,"" a statement said.

It added that additional Ukrainian strikes have caused further damage to the key Antonovsky Bridge, though Russia has conducted temporary repairs.

I had a thought about the S-300s being used against land targets. Some say that using them in a way that they weren’t designed for indicates that Russia is running out of precision weapons, others say that the S-300 was designed this way as a secondary function, so it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything. But with all the talk of the US donating advanced fighter jets, it seems really stupid to be using them this way. Right? It seems like they are running out of precision weapons AND they are so desperate they can’t afford to plan for months or a year into the future.

Erdogan believes his relationship with Russia has given him a bargaining position. In the past he has threatening the United States by cozying up to Putin, and then moving away from him when he wants something from Washington.

This is 100% the play. Putin knows he can extract whatever concessions he wants from/via the UN by appealing to their desire for diplomacy, then do whatever he wants without repercussions.

This is an example of when/how excessive focuses on diplomacy is a bad thing. Bring the US and other allies to the table, and outline clear consequences for breaching agreements (eg special weapons transfers to Ukraine each day the agreement is violated).

If you and I made an agreement together, we would be at the total mercy of other authorities if we breached it. Without clear consequences for violations, there is no incentive whatsoever for Russia to follow any agreements. And they won't.

For example, if a humanitarian corridor is attacked (regardless of who by), then international troops will move in to secure humanitarian corridors, without it being a declaration of war.

The low price tag is one remarkable feature.  Further is a small start-up company.  No surprise lobbyists and PR clowns are not racing to support it.  

The pricetag on switchblade 300 is likely much lower than the sticker price.  They sold 1000 of them for $6,000 each.  They must have had a manufacturing space and a few employees.  $6 million total does not buy a whole lot of stuff.  Suppose, instead, we spend $600 million.  We probably get more than 100,000 unit.  For $6 billion we should get much more than a million of them.  There were only 260,000 Russian soldiers.

But it turns out it has a very limited frag grenade warhead, short range and due to its suicide nature it's a bit hard to get good practice on.

I remember people (me included) thinking it'd be great against soldiers in trenches but then we see regular drones dropping bombs do work or just arty that's accurate enough. Maybe it'll have some usage vs the troops holed up in the nuclear power plant now though?

Sadly we don't know what the Phoenix Ghost drone does which was actually a new type of drone that's more adapted to what Ukraine wants. Chances are it's something that has a bit better ranger and is good at recon and maybe a bit better against EW but I dunno.

Ua pilots not only need to learn that muscle memory they need to forget the totally opposite memory that they have from the Soviet jets.

Putin really has sort of pulled off a Christmas miracle.  In one fell swoop he has

1) convinced Russia's neighbors that Russia is a paper tiger and they no longer have to give a fuck what Russia says on any topic whatsoever.  Nations will fall out of Russia's orbit because of Putin's debacle

2) permanently damaged the Russian arms industry by convincing would-be buyers that Russian weapons aren't quite ready for prime time

3) Permanently damaged multiple Russian industries, including not just foreign-dependent industries but many domestic ones too like tech as Putin's blocking of things like Google permanently impacts Russian software developers and other tech.  

4) Dramatically decreased long term international investment in just not Russia but also other less-than-stable entities like China as investors realize China could receive the same economic beatdown Russia did if it invades Taiwan.

5) Significantly strengthened the mono-polar USA/EU world that Putin hates so much, removed Russia from contention in any category whatsoever, and left China awkwardly trying to be neutral between order and chaos.

6) Threatened his won hold of Donbas and Crimea, that latter of which Ukraine never had a prayer of taking back until this invasion.

7) Possibly ushered in a Russian societal collapse as the Russian public begins to realize there (will be) 100,000 or more dead Russians, their entire military destroyed for decades, and they (may) have less than nothing to show for it, could lose Crimea, Transnistria, not to mention McDonalds, Microsoft and IBM and be unable to have airbags in their cars.

8) There will likely be terror attacks in Moscow and Russia for decades as Putin's victims grow up and come for their pound of flesh.

The other places all face geographic problems of isolation.

So far my impression has been that the sanctions on the energy exports haven't been that effective because Russia has been able to compensate with new buyers or higher prices and some European nations are still stuck buying from Russia until much in the future. So the real threat is more in the future once things stabilize and Russia loses the entire European market on that front which can't easily be compensated in full.

To my knowledge the problem Russia has due to the sanctions is that it doesn't have access to critical imports it needs, especially for its industry and if they want to substitute it locally it's going to become a massive drag on the economy that will make them way behind the world. 

So yeah, it'd be interesting to hear from the people downvoting you on what they disagree with. To me the energy side of the sanctions feel important to make new connections so we don't directly pay Russia for their war and that we can prepare for a future Russia where doesn't have such a big influence over us but it's also not something that has had a direct and heavy impact on Russia's revenue stream in the short term while also causing a price hike as people fight for other options than Russia which previously couldn't compete with Russia and I think it's weird to look at this specific case of energy exports as sanctions working because it plays into the Russian narrative of the west mostly hurting itself more than them (which in the short term looks correct to me) and I'd rather focus on why it's needed or the more other succesful uses of the sanctions.

A few things worth keeping in mind, IMO, is that there's most likely not a singular cause behind the decision to invade as well as the fact that they weren't expecting a prolonged conflict.

My guess would be that the motivation for the invasion was the following:

**1.** To improve the public opinion of Putin's regime (it was at its highest when they stole Crimea). 

**2.** To distract from the downward trend of the Russian economy (they've gradually been forced to move their fossil fuel extraction operations closer and closer to the arctic as well as target more difficult and expensive extract sources), not to mention the world gradually moving away from fossil fuels).

**3.** The discovery of large reserves of fossil fuel in and around the black sea.

**4.** To try to prevent Ukrainian prosperity due to modernization and further integration with the west (since they're culturally very close to Russia and due to a lot of Ukrainians and Russians having family in either country; it would be a nightmare for Putin's regime if Ukraine were to prosper while the quality of life in Russia continues to deteriorate).

**5.** Megalomania and Soviet nostalgia. Putin definitely has imperialist delusions of grandeur (wanting to form Greater Russia by merging Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, etc). And if Russia were to want to push further west or southwest down the line, then taking Ukraine is definitely one of the first steps involved in this.

**6.** Fertile land. Russia is big, but only a small percentage of their land (mostly of it concentrated in the west-southwest near the border to Belarus and Ukraine as well as the North Caucasus). The fresh-water access is a factor here as well, of course.

**7.** Vengeance. Basically a combination of points 4 and 5. The Russian Federation's influence on Ukraine has been steadily dwindling since a bit before Euromaidan, which is something that is unacceptable to megalomaniac, abusive sociopaths like Putin.

So they probably figured that they have a lot of gain if they could take over Ukraine; but their domestic and foreign intel was both outdated and downright faulty so they completely miscalculated how their ""special operation"" would turn out. Likely they were banking on it going similarly to how the Prague Spring of 1968 went for the Soviet Union (basically invading with an overwhelming force without any resistance, deposing the leader, and conquering the whole nation with barely any blood spilled).",False,1658564183.0,t3_w5ualx,t1_ihanb3a,,2,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia needs a mass mobilization, but that can only happen with public support.  To achieve this they will need something like NATO intervening by opening a safe corridor.  The only way that could happen is if NATO announces to Russia that they will hit any ship that interferes.  

Russia needs an escalation that they didn't cause.  I don't see how they can survive this war without one.  Western support isn't falling, it's getting larger and more sophisticated.  Russia is experiencing manpower shortages with no replacements forthcoming.  No matter what Russia can't hold these areas 2-3 years from now, they will eventually lose.

And after that 2 year course, the pilots are taught how to fight.
