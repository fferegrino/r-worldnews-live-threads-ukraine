Day 286 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was much quieter than yesterday as we had no missile strikes, or rather no big ones, because some small ones still did happen in Dnipro in the evening, though I'm not sure what was hit. Also today Russians used their Shaheds for the first time in a couple of weeks. They sent some at Kyiv and some at Dnipro, but I don't think they actually managed to hit their targets this time, there weren't a lot of them.

I guess they decided to use them again because of our drone strikes against their military bases, which they probably thought they have to respond to. It's great to see that there were more of our drone strikes today, one of the targets was an air base in Kursk and the other was a fuel depot in Bryansk. Hopefully we still have more drones and continue to do more strikes, maybe one could even be happening right about now, the previous ones were in the early morning, so the time frame fits.

The problems with electricity right now are nowhere near as bad as the ones we had after the previous missile strikes. Pretty much the only 2 regions which were affected are Kyiv and Odesa, other regions basically didn't even notice a new missile strike happening. In Kharkiv scheduled blackouts continue as they did before, they didn't get longer, and we also had our curfew shortened by 2 hours, so now it lasts from 11pm to 5am (down from 10pm-6am).

This problem will only continue to get worse if Ukraine can successfully launch another offensive and continue to make the Russian public question why are we even fighting in the first place.

They wanted to approach this conflict like the player holding all of the cards, however now that the game has played out, the West knows what it has left in its hands. Russia can't bluff its way out of this, all it can do is threaten to flip the table over.

> I am currently in Moscow. Attempt #3 to take direct part in fighting against the armed forces of the respected Kiev partners (now referred to in MoD briefings as ""militants"" for some reason) was not successful, although it was very close to it.

> Briefly, without going into detail:

> I arrived (by appointment) in the first decade of October on the territory of the DPR, and on the 14th I went to one of military registration and enlistment offices of the republic, where I submitted a request to volunteer for mobilization into the DPR Armed Forces. On the same day I was enlisted in a march battalion of the n-th motorized rifle brigade of the 1st corps of the National Front of the DNR for subsequent enlistment in the n-th battalion of the n-th rifle regiment. Received the appropriate temporary certificate. (Enclosed). In the course of a number of business trips, I visited Donetsk several times. I was told (unofficially) that the ""uncoordinated"" enlistment into the DNR National Front had caused dissatisfaction among the ""higher command"", but was assured that the issue ""would be resolved in time,"" and that in the meantime I would perform my duties in the formal capacity of a private (which suited me fine, since the choice between ""form or function"" was always ""function"" and I had no intention of seeking command positions and the privileges and regalia associated with them).

> Then, after a fairly long stay at the military training ground as Acting Chief of Staff of the battalion being formed, in November, I left with a group of battalion men to the location of the main force of the n-th regiment in the town of Svatovo, where I spent little more than 10 days trying to perform the duties of battalion Chief of Staff in preparation for its forthcoming military deployment at the front. The unit's location was in the range of enemy field artillery fire, but during my stay it was never fired upon (although this town and its surroundings had been hit more than once before).
> I then departed again, first to the n-th brigade's home base and then on to the training ground.
At the end of November I was somewhat perplexed to find out that I was not only out of my battalion's commission but also not on the staff list of the n-th regiment. Further trying to understand my status I soon found out that I too was not listed in the personnel lists of the n-th brigade (march batallion that had joined when I enlisted).

>Further informal investigation made it possible to establish the following in general terms:

>\- Shortly after enlisting in the marching company I was transferred to the n-th regiment, to which I was enlisted for exactly one day (listed in the morning and taken out without a trace in the evening). All these manipulations (probably carried out under pressure from 'above') were not formalised by any orders.

>\- As a result, from October until the end of November I was in the n-th battalion of the n-th regiment illegally, carried weapons and ammunition illegally, travelled illegally to the area of military defense and to the >front-line zone. If anything had happened to me on those trips... do I have to explain that it would be represented only by ""amateurishness of adventurer Girkin"" or (in the best case) by an accident while carrying out ""volunteer activity""? - With a corresponding complete lack of obligations on the part of the RF/DPR forces and the state towards me.

>\- The n-th regiment and battalion commanders knew about all this, but - while receiving very substantial assistance to their unit (food, equipment, vehicles, funds for fuel and lubricants, volunteers, etc.) thanks to my presence in the regiment and battalion - they chose not to inform me about it.

> The discovery of all these circumstances made my further stay in the n-th regiment impossible. And since I was not (as indicated above) formally a member of the n-th regiment, I had only to surrender my illegally issued assault rifle, pistol, grenades and ammunition (because the battalion was not at the front or even in the front-line zone and it was unknown when or if it would ever get there), settle the pressing issues with the undistributed equipment and humanitarian supplies, as well as the volunteers (most of them redirected - together with ""Prapor"" - to the combat units and units with more adequate, responsible and competent commanders) and go wherever I like.

Most brazen? Moskva, section of the Kerch Strait bridge blown to shit, sea drone attack on Sevastopol harbor, Ukraine forces of course are not lacking for brazen attacks.


>The strikes signaled a new willingness by Kyiv to take the fight to bases in the heart of Russia, raising the stakes in the war, and demonstrated for the first time Ukraine’s ability to attack at such long distances.

This could be monumental, remember how much sneaking drones into Sebastopol harbor has changed their behavior, this delves deep into the Russian psyche.

I love this shit:

>Ukraine’s government declined to publicly acknowledge the strikes, in keeping with its practice with other attacks on Russia and Russian-occupied Crimea.

It's like the new humble brag, just don't think about them at all, leave them wondering: *are the calls coming from inside the house!?*

That way The West is not 'attacking' Russia by proxy through Ukraine. But then if Ukraine, all on its own, happens to build and deploy weapons that attack Russia? Well, that's between Ukraine and Russia and The West had nothing to do with it. I think it's a policy designed to keep Russia from e.g. sending drones into, say, Germany and bombing their air force bases.

I agree in practice all these distinctions seem silly (is this rifle a defending rifle or an attacking rifle?). But I think the main use is from a diplomatic perspective. The West is providing a clear scope of involvement to Russia and importantly that scope does not change. That makes The West predictable for Russia and in turn makes Russia more predictable to The West. An idea being if the chosen scope did not trigger WWIII, then continuing with that scope is safe. But that changing the scope of involvement would force everyone to re-evaluate and would therefore be riskier. Also, that if one party starts changing their rules, then they become unpredictable which in turns makes other players at the table unpredictable, which is probably in no one's interest. 

So I think at this point, The West *could* likely do more, but they also feel safe not to. Ukraine is clearly winning and there's nothing on the horizon that says things will get better for Russia (only worse).

If the contract for ammunition supply is with Germany and preexists the conflict then it can't be said to be non-neutral to supply Germany during a war, it's just fulfilling a contract.

Ukraine was given these vehicles during a time of war as a form of military support, and if Ukraine is at war then maybe it can be considered a different scenario, argued by Russia to be non-neutral.

I know people will say ""fuck their opinion"", but it'd still be something that sticks in the long term, and that might well be what Switzerland is concerned about if it is a genuine act on their part. Whether or not it is you can debate amongst yourselves. I'm not interested in that shitfest, but these export restrictions were in the contract long before this war started, so the restrictions aren't related to this war, they clearly have a reason to write those in.

Common sense would suggest that it'd still be just another business deal with the ammunition sale, not a free supply or support specifically, but this is the kind of thing where maybe there's some quirk of law and/or diplomacy that I don't understand that a lawyer might, so I would be interested a take on this by an actual lawyer with experience in this kind of thing.

All that said, Germany's take is entirely reasonable.

Planes can absolutely land with armaments. Aircraft can fly missions like combat air patrol or defensive counter-air (i.e- bad dude is coming your way, your job is to make him not get there) and not face a threat and come back to land.


What other people are saying is otherwise true. Planes will generally have a maximum landing weight, and that is generally a structural limitation, such as a landing gear's ability not to get damaged at max landing weight and max touchdown rate (overriding the max landing weight is permissive if there's an emergency that necessitates landing as soon possible, such as a fire, but that's neither here nor there).


What I don't know 100% is what the TU-95s (planes in question) max landing weight is and if their combination of fuel/missiles puts them over it. Moreover, I don't know what their restriction with landing with armament is (i.e- can't land with external weapons, internal weapons, can't land with weapons at all, they can land with them if they're under their landing weight, etc). The source tweet says it can't land fully armed so it may be that a full combat load would put them above their max landing weight, even with the minimum required fuel for landing (that's speculation under the assumption that the bit about armament in the tweet is true). In this case they'd either have to jettison the missiles or fire, which firing is the obvious choice if the missile would be lost anyway.

It's a council of 7 where the 4 biggest parties hold one or two seats each, the seat distribution is unchanging regardless of election results and incumbents are reelected without contest unless their own party boots them.

If our executive, comprised of SocDem, centrist, liberal and hard right conservative bureaucrats with 100% job security and really 0 angle for being bribed say that they're afraid of arms exports to Ukraine nullifying our international neutral status, then that's the reason they're blocking the export. We're already sanctioning RU and helping UA with everything but arms, there's no question on whose side we stand.

Edit: others accuse Switzerland of being opportunists. Neutrality on its own is the exact opposite of opportunism, you literally promise your country's sovereignty and standing in the world as collateral for the claim that you won't seek opportunities to intervene in anyone else's business.

and many sailors feared that if they sailed too far they
would ‘‘sail off the edge of the Earth,’’ a saying that
remains with us to this day. This may have provided a
convenient excuse for sailing expeditions that failed to
identify a passage. However, nearly a century later, the Italian astronomer, physicist, and scientist Galileo Galilei
(1564-1642) observed by telescope that the planets were
round (Letters on Sunspots, 1612), a finding that was still
considered new and controversial at the time despite the
previous circumnavigation of our globe. *Galileo also
hypothesized that the Earth rotated around the sun*
(heliocentrism), a view that went beyond controversy but
was considered blasphemy by the Roman Catholic
Church, as it explicitly contradicted the Holy Scriptures.
Galileo was tried by the Roman Inquisition in 1615,
convicted of heresy, and was forced to recant his views
and placed under house arrest for the remainder of his
life. He may have gotten off lightly because other

>Without the military industry and logistics to support an invading force, you can't just throw the entire population of your country at it.

Again, no one said that. OP wanted to know how many casualties Russia can sustain, and that very much depends on the population. I included the WWI figures because helpful way to contextualize what 90,000 killed means. 

For Estonia 90,000 soldiers killed would mean their entire military has been killed, twice. Reserves included. The war is over, Estonia lost. For Russia, 90,000 killed is about 10% of active personnel. Russia can keep taking losses like this, especially as mobilization means they can keep the 300,000+ Rosgvardiya interior troops inside Russia to keep order. They've done it before, repeatedly. The more people you have, the more you can lose. And Russia can lose a lot.

>They'd just make good target practice for artillery and not much else.

Most jobs in the military don't have you in artillery range. Even a freshly mobilized conscript will little training or equipment can load and unload trucks, file paperwork, and all the other tasks that make a military function.

>It's not a numbers game, you can't send naked, unarmed mobiks like a swarm across the border and pray for the best.

They aren't naked and they aren't unarmed. Stop drinking the kool-aid and try reading what Ukrainians who are fighting are saying. Try listening to some actual analysts. Not just one or two, but several. The fighting is tough and Ukraine is taking a lot of casualties. As many as Russia, no, but still a lot. And it's gotten more difficult since more mobilized troops started arriving. 

Some mobilized troops are being used in attacks, but mostly they are being used to filled out defensive positions. Private conscriptovich may be cold, miserable, and a lousy shot, but he's still in the trench with a AK and you have to deal with him if you want to take Svartove. You're life as a Ukrainian soldier would be a lot easier if he wasn't there on your part of the front. If he and his buddies never showed up, the whole war would be easier for you.

Was bombed 40 times or so - still operational, as repairs are not too difficult, unless special weapons, like the durandal are used. So it's limited to a vehicle if well organized or several at best. Each one is fairly high impact, though.

- Army bases - true, and valid, but the impact is fairly small. An attack here might kill a few conscripts, or a vehicle or two. All of which are obsolete, unless you somehow find where they're hiding the 3000 black armatas of Putin. And even then, it's more for morale. No big loss to the war effort.

- Munition stockpiles - solid targets indeed.

- Naval bases and fleets - Russian black sea fleet is already pretty much out of comission. They're too afraid to leave port, due to drones and neptunes.

So as effective targets you're left with air bases, munition dumps, and transport infrastructure. But if you hit the infra, they can't deploy the munitions or troops effectively, so it's a two for one effect. Ideally, you could hit all 3, but hey, there's only so many Tu-141s. And I'm skeptical about their accuracy/effectiveness, tbh..
Ultimately, as long as they don't have the ability to put out a significant number of such deep strikes, I think the biggest effect will be on morale, so it probably doesn't matter what they hit - so yeah, sticking to purely military targets is the more palatable option in that case.
