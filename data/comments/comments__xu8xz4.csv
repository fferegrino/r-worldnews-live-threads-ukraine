Day 222 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Sadly today wasn‚Äôt a quiet day, there was no shelling, but they fired 2 missiles from Belgorod exactly at midnight, both of which landed in Kharkiv. As expected the quiet days didn‚Äôt last for long, and those 2 missiles were very loud, one of them hit an industrial facility, the other hit infrastructure, some people reported their electricity being cut after the explosions, but it wasn‚Äôt widespread, they might have hit another substation.

This again just reinforces the fact that they are losing badly on the battlefield. They *always* shell or send some missiles at Kharkiv every single time they face a major defeat on any of the directions. It‚Äôs actually surprising that they *only* fired 2 missiles at us after losing in at least 3 directions at the same time. Usually when it‚Äôs that bad for them, they send anywhere from 4 to 16 missiles at us, but today it was just 2.

It‚Äôs also interesting to see that right after Russia started losing badly, suddenly a ton of posts started popping up on every social media, saying that we need peace talks *immediately,* because of course we can‚Äôt let Russia lose, because then it‚Äôs nuclear war, or even worse, that ‚ÄúUkraine can‚Äôt win anyway, so let‚Äôs just surrender now, and stop the mindless killing‚Äù like Musk did today. 

Do people really not see what state Russian army is in? Like no, the ‚Äúfull mobilization‚Äù won‚Äôt help them win, people they will be mobilizing are not professional soldiers, and the mandatory military service in Russia is a joke, it only teaches you how to build dachas for your superiors and clean toilets, not how to be an effective soldier. 

A son of one of our relatives from Russia literally had to make his family pay monthly ransom to his superiors at the place he was going through his mandatory service, just so that they won‚Äôt cripple or even kill him. I‚Äôm pretty sure that happened because he bragged to them about his family being wealthy, but do you see just how dysfunctional their ‚Äúreserves‚Äù are? Also my mom‚Äôs brother basically became a cripple, with permanent health problems, from dedovschina during his mandatory service. Though that was a very long time ago, I don‚Äôt remember if it happened before or after the Soviet Union fell apart.",False,1664843654.0,t3_xu8xz4,t3_xu8xz4,,0,158,0,158,1,0,

- Putin's unusually rapid acknowledgement of problems highlights the dysfunction of the mobilisation over its first week. Local officials are likely unclear on the exact scope and legal rationale of the campaign. They have almost certainly drafted some personnel who are outside the definitions claimed by Putin and the Ministry of Defence.

- As drafted reservists continue to assemble at tented transit camps, Russian officials are likely struggling to provide training and in finding officers to lead new units.

Ukrovskoe command show miracles of strategy and military leadership talents?  - NO!  They act ingenuously, having the fullness of intelligence, and all NATO intelligence is working for them, they are accumulating strike groups in those places where we are ‚Äúthinly‚Äù and hit.  Where our units resist, nothing comes of the Ukrainians, and they suffer huge losses.  But losses are not important for them, they have a lot of meat.  The main thing is that they do not invent anything, but use our mistakes.  Plus, they act the way we did in 2014 against the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  Bold, confident and sure.  Only then we did not have what the Ukrainians have.

 >Better late than never, but we need to prepare front-line cities and towns for defense.  Prepare for urban battles.  Motivation is very important for urban battles.  The commanders need to finally explain what the meaning of this war is.  Explain that if you do not stop the enemy here and now, then he will have to be stopped on the threshold of their homes.  And their cities can very quickly become front-line.  And it's not about the Donbass or Ukraine.  This war is more global and started many years ago by the West.  Ukraine tricked but voluntarily agreed to become a battlefield between NATO and Russia.  Either we will win on the territory of the former Ukraine, or we will have to win on the territory of Russia.  Every fighter must understand this - he went to war so that the war itself would not come to his house.

Minor age should not interfere with the training of the defenders of our Motherland. The grandchildren of the First President of the Chechen Republic, Hero of Russia Akhmat-Khadzhi Kadyrov - Akhmat, Eli and Adam are 16, 15 and 14 years old respectively. But their military training began a long time ago, almost from an early age. It's not enough just to know how to shoot. On the basis of the RUS, they are taught how to handle various weapons, how to use them at any distance, and the theoretical foundations. I always believed that the main goal of any father is to instill piety in his sons and teach them to protect the family, the people, the Fatherland. If you want peace, prepare for war! Akhmat, Eli and Adam are ready to use their skills in the NWO zone. And I'm not kidding. It's time to show themselves in a real fight, and this is their desire, I only welcome. Soon they will go to the front line and will be on the most difficult sections of the line of contact. I appeal to the idle talkers who claimed that my relatives do not take part in the SVO: in the near future you will have the opportunity to take positions with the guys and personally see that AKHMAT is POWER! Show on the spot your spirit, your ideology and what you are like in general. Prove that you are at least a little bit of a man.

Now, he made a video again, using recent satellite imagery: Russia has 800-900 less tanks in storage.

Edit: so a lot of people commented how degraded some tanks in storage must be. I fully agree. One reason is that the refurbished number of tanks fall short of even fully reinforcing the current losses.

This war was not about creating a buffer zone against the west.

The blitz could easily happen through Belarus, Finland, the Baltic, etc.

What was the war about? 2 things and both have to do with outings grasp on power. 1) Ukraine rejected Russia and challenged putins power over them after the maidan revolution. It is clear from putins speech at the Munich security conference that he wants to go back to a ""multipolar"" world where he has his sphere of influence that he is able to control. Ukraine made him look weak in 2014, and that is a threat to his power in general 2) War is a way to rally support from the Russian political right and as a way for him to boost popularity that he was losing as the Russian economy stagnated after gas prices dropped over the last 8 or so years.

The dynamic has not changed. Russia has a ton of land and barely any people working it along with a collapsing birth rate. War trades people now for land and people later. But Ukraine's birthrate is also terrible, so unlike in the old Czars serfdom expanding conquests there would never be a net gain of souls in the long run.

Killing nazis and the fake elections give him propaganda for using military force.  These elections help keep his propaganda machine going for easy putin support trying to ""liberate"" areas that want to be russia.  And they have reasons to sell why they are and will lose. 

Then with the mass mobilization of minorities, a larger civilian invasion force of refugees out of the country keep his power secure.  People who appose him are leaving.  Educated people are leaving.  Minorities in the rural oblasts are leaving.  putin is essentially doing his own purge as all ""great"" russian leaders do. 

Getting rid of minorities in rural russia (dead, wounded and those fleeing) also keeps power in moscow. Helps prevent rebellions from within.

If you game the outcomes it doesnt look likely they will go down that road. Cant find a single likely outcome where ruzzia wins.

1. Ruzzia uses a tactical nuke. NATO responds in accordance with what they have been communicating to Kreml for a while: destruction of the ruzzian forces in Ukraine and the Black Sea by conventional force. Ruzzia takes the loss (putin is put out of power) and de-escalates. Loss.

2. As above but ruzzia escalates to a broad strategic nuclear response to answer NATOs devastating blow. Depending on the state of ruzzias nuclear stockpile with regards to maintance the outcome might be different. Draw or loss.

3. Same as above but ruzzian nuclear forces refuses, in whole or partially, to launch. NATO most likely sees this even at full refusal from the ruzzian forces and strikes hard and fast. Loss.

4. Ruzzia escalates to a strategic nuclear response but isolated to Kyiv, Paris, Berlin or London. NATO de-escalates by annihilating every military force in ruzzia through conventional means. Ruzzia either takes the L or escalates further with full exchange as a result. Draw or loss.

Its also important to understand this: if anything comes close to a full exchange, China will be affected. There is a lot of talk about China and ruzzia beeing allies, in reality they are not. There is a very real chance China gets nuked as well to deny them future hegemony and China knows this. If things really start to hit the fan, they will make an herculean effort to de-escalate. And thats just from being directly hit.

Tl:Dr: Pacifists can't win  
  
The Pacifist Paradox  
  
Pacifism is a noble idea of no war and violence. However, in a world drenched in the blood of ancient crimes, it seems unlikely it will ever come to fruition, so long as there is a bone for someone to pick about something. This doesn't stop some from trying, however. Some may simply be optimistic, others might believe in pacifism on religious grounds. Regardless of the reasons, they can be the subject of verbal abuse due to their love for peace in a time of active war.  
  
This is compounded when one side in a war has strong evidence of crimes against humanity committed by the other, and furthermore when the pacifist is a leader of any kind. As a leader, the person in question must take a stance of some kind in relation to the war at the demand of their subjects. Here's where the paradox comes into place.  
  
On one hand, the leader may condemn the side that is accused of the crime and gain the favor of the international community. However, this goes against their pacifist beliefs by taking a side in the conflict. In addition, they can not go back to their prior neutrality/pacifism as they would be denounced by their peers for hypocrisy.  
  
On the other hand, the leader may call for peace and immediate negotiations between the two sides. However, peace most often benefits the side that is currently losing, and that can anger some into believing that the pacifist is in favor of said losing side. This only gets worse for the leader in question once you replace either side with one that has allegedly (with strong evidence) committed human rights and Geneva convention violations. Now, it appears the pacifist is content with letting this side commit these crimes and letting them go unpunished. Whether they actually do is up to peace negotiations, but obviously, some don't trust that.  
  
So here we got one option where the pacifist is a hypocrite to their peers, despite taking the morally sound side. And on the other, a side that coincides with their beliefs, but leaves them extremely exposed to criticism from others. This is a dilemma, not a problem, as there isn't a right and wrong answer, but simply two bad options. Either way, the pacifist loses, either to the world, or their peers.  
  
P.S. There is of course the third option, condemning the morally right side, but I don't need to spell out why that is bad for the pacifist. It only works out for the pacifist if both sides are committing violations.

Edit: I am not a pacifist myself, just thought this was interesting to point out. Slava Ukraine!",1664808058.0,1664807753.0,t3_xu8xz4,t3_xu8xz4,,0,-9,0,-9,0,0,

Firstly I want to say for me personally any loss of human life is a tragedy, but with that said, unfortunately we seem to live in a world were some life lost now will prevent more life lost later.

A lot of people have given Noam shit about his stance, which I totally understand, without US and broad European support Ukraine would be having a much harder time on the field, let alone the moral questions of how the conflict began, has been fought, and the aftermath of the populations who are immediately affected.

Chomsky is afraid of a nuclear response from Russia. He is not wrong to be afraid, there is a not 0 chance that Russia COULD nuke Ukraine. I do however disagree on the reasoning why Russia hasn't.

If the US and EU stepped out of this conflict, dropped sanctions, and withheld additional military support to the Ukraine, Russia no longer has any reason not to level the country. Western pressure through the current world market has clearly been a real leash on Russia.

All that to say, dialogue is important, I respect people's opinions and think it's good to ask questions about powerful countries decision making. I disagree with Noam Chomsky's opinions in this particular conflict, but I think his opinion brings up thoughtful discussion in the matter.

It's the classic order of an angry narcissist with no understanding of military strategy who cant understand why he's losing and wants to do something decisive.

There will  be times where retreat is obviously the right decision, where it is better to sacrifice some positions to have the troops available for more  crucial fights, and where you simply need to redeploy to prevent an enemy exploiting a weak spot. Those are often decisions competent commanders on the ground have to make since they are best placed to assess how much pressure a position is actually under and rapidly understand what an enemy is trying to do.

Taking that decision away from your commanders and replace it with a blanket politically motivated order and an enemy who is competent (tick) mobile (tick) and has good intel sources (tick) is a recipe to get absolutely fucked sideways.

ebfeb9bb30bf522444167d8c4b0ae268,xu8xz4,iqw2wdi,"The reason we hear so much about Dresden is that immediately after the war, the Soviets deliberately made it a piece of propaganda about how cruel the West had been to German civilians during WWII, in an attempt to win over the German population - completely shamelessly looking over the obvious truth that the Soviets had been extremely cruel, and indeed far, far more cruel than the western allies to German civilians, often just for the sake of cruelty, as revenge of the atrocities that Germans had committed on Soviet civilians. And in fact Stalin had repeatedly asked for the western Allies to bomb more German cities. 

Putin is just continuing this tradition. He is digging up all the old Soviet propaganda. It is also just another piece of whataboutism, and the unshakeable Russian belief that two wrongs somehow make a right. In the Russian worldview, it is apparently okay to kill thousands civilians, if you can point out that someone else killed a civilian at some point. 

Indeed, that is a classic dishonest argument used repeatedly by terrible people. They deliberately omit all the details and intensity and argue that two things are the exact same if they have some vaguely similar properties, e.g. that a civilian died. This leads to beliefs such as that the accidental death of one civilian makes a country or a leader completely morally equal to someone who deliberately killed a thousand civilians. A similar argument is used in other contexts by other terrible people, e.g. ""All countries just do realist geopolitics, get over it"" (which of course favours the most ruthless and selfish countries), ""All politicians are corrupt"" (which obviously favours the most corrupt politicians, because they are treated as equal to anyone who is arguably even slightly corrupt).",1664809943.0,1664809366.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqw13gf,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

This is also why k and h can be hard for young children, it's a quite complex set of movements and it takes development and practice to learn, just like fine motor skill for younger kids. 

If you take courses in slavic languages some teachers will work with the students on how to make the phonetics with the combination of the physical anatomy and how you expel your breath.  Once you work on it a little bit you can also start to hear the subtle differences between the sounds. 

From my experience the 'kh' in kherson is much softer than a hard 'k' sound but it has just a touch of the slightly back of the mouth tongue to palate movement that a 'k' has so you get just a bit harder start to the 'h' sound that you hear in english/latin based languages.",1664808463.0,1664808213.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqvrole,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Aged like fine milk, hasn‚Äôt it. 

As we now know, Russian military reforms were aimed at ‚Äúdazzling‚Äù observers - in other words, creating a ‚ÄúPotemkin Army‚Äù. Dazzling observers requires different things from winning battles. The latter requires commitment to military fundamentals, which are not ‚Äúdazzling‚Äù and largely go unseen by casual observers. 

Russia fooled many of the experts, so it is no surprise that we, who are not experts, were also fooled. Though there were always persistent rumours about Russian inefficiency and corruption, plus small relative size of their economy (how can they build a force that could challenge NATO when their economy is about the size of Italy‚Äôs?). Nonetheless, few really understood how disfunctional the Russian military really was - like in the above article, it was assumed Russian military reforms were largely successful. 

TLDR: no-one should beat themselves up about being fooled into thinking the Russian military was mighty. The Russians put a lot of effort into fooling the experts into thinking this way, and many were in fact fooled.",False,1664804285.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqvmpyo,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Of important note is that the fertility rate fell to 1.2 (2.3 is the replacement rate) during the 90s and early 2000s which means the pool of manpower that can be militarized (of traditional military age  and gender ) is low.  

Love this quote:

*Given the projected decline in men aged 20-34 by 2030, to maintain a military of 900,000 Russia would have to increase its militarization rate to 7.79 percent in 2025 and 8.01 percent in 2030. When viewed in a vacuum, these metrics mean very little. When compared to other countries, however, they reveal just how militarized Russian society already is. Here are the 2020 militarization rates for other powers: the United States, 3.86 percent; France, 3.62 percent; Turkey, 3.58 percent; Italy, 3.52 percent; Japan, 2.54 percent; Pakistan, 2.24 percent; United Kingdom, 2.21 percent; China, 1.24 percent; India, 0.77 percent. Russia is also more militarized than its neighbors; Ukraine‚Äôs 2020 militarization rate was 4.82 percent, Romania‚Äôs 3.80 percent, and Poland‚Äôs 3.16 percent.*

I don't think you can reasonably make Major before age 30. Using (reasonable) _**minimum**_ ages/timeframes. There are exceptions ofc.

Being an officer requires a degree, so that's ~22.

2nd Lt to 1st LT takes 24 months TIG, so that's ~24.

1st Lt to Captain takes 24 months TIG, so that's ~26.

Captain to Major is typically ~8yrs TIS, ~4yrs TIG, so that's ~30.

Each rank following Major is ~4yrs in between at the least. Captain is the highest 'guaranteed' rank an officer can make. The rest they have to compete for.

Between 9/8 and today is over 3 weeks.  That is about 1/6 of the land of the land Russia still occupies that it seized this year.

And almost all of that land was recaptured by 9/14.   Ukraine has seized little land between 9/14 and now.  At the current pace of seizing land, it will take years to retake all of Ukraine.

Ukraine is advancing.  But look at the big map to see what those advances really mean.  Don't listen to the hype of the names of lots of tiny villages a few miles apart and think that Ukraine is making huge advances at pushing out the Russians.

Interesting line too. If Russia fails to hold onto the parts of Ukraine it controls and retreats, there will still be a Russian state tomorrow. There is also no real evidence to suggest that Putin can't survive a failed invasion of Ukraine. He controls the propagandist narrative so deeply in Russia that they could spin this web of failures in any method they see fit.

In both the North and South the Russians had the ability to attack from several directions (From the South and East, from the North and East) and Ukraine wasn‚Äôt fully prepared. The main difference(aside from a bit more Pro-Russian sentiment in the South East, which hardly made a difference except perhaps in North Luhansk) is that the North was completely covered in swampy mud and Rasputitsa from the thaw and was often cold enough at night for frostbite, while the south was far warmer and drier with minimal mud and above freezing nights.

In the North, the Russians were forced to stick to roads, and thus had extremely easy to stall movements and logistics even with a underprepared Ukraine. Mud ruined vehicles and frost weakened soldiers, and Russia was only able to operate on highways. Sumy and Chernihivs ‚Äòsieges‚Äô were paper thin, Kharkiv‚Äôs southern flank was forested and safe, and Kyiv could only be attacked head on. 

In the South, minimal mud allowed the Russians to maneuver far more easily, operating on fields. Melitopol and Kherson were cut off and surrendered, same with Berdyansk and Enderhor. Mariupol held out with determination, but was eventually worn down and broke.

Would the North have ended up the same if the weather had been different, the fields dry and drivable? Would Kharkiv, Sumy, and Chernihiv have buckled just like Melitopol?

-----

I've seen analysis on the 1st Guards Tank Army, Russia's ""best"" and ""elite"" tank unit. They were good when the war started, but they've been overdeployed and took massive casualties. As Russia's best-of-the-best tank group got wiped out, Russia slowly lost the open-planes advantage.

Ukraine needs to be careful with their tank forces/mechanized forces. Ukraine never had the legions of tanks like Russia did, but Ukraine also had way better training, better morale, and better commanders who value the lives of these elite soldiers.

Top-end combined-arms teams are the best equipped, but as a tradeoff, they are always sent to the heaviest fighting regions over-and-over again. Their psyche / morale is hit the most.

The non-russian ownership of that portion of the line made them a major threat to the economic well-being of russia. Since 1/3 of their whole economy is funded by selling oil to the EU, Ukraine ramping up their own production was causing prices to drop. Poopin decided it was easier to murder their neighbor and take their oil reserves than to find ways of meaningfully contributing to the world economy.

Its the same reason russia went after Crimea and had a bunch of people move into that southeast area of Ukraine. They now sit on the two largest hydrocarbon reserves in Ukraine and made all the western investors unwilling to participate due to instability. The next step is to try and annex the major field so that other people can't be an alternative to their oil.

There's 2 major things

* Russia has fewer pilots than they do airframes.  They simply dont have a deep enough bench of talent to utilize all the jets they have in storage.


* Maintenance kills.  Military jet aircraft devour spare parts, and Russia has been operating their Ukraine air squadrons for months longer than anticipated.  Most military jets will become dangerous to fly in < 3 months of regular use if they arent able to get key engine components replaced.  Russia evidently lacks these spares and cannot get more.

AFU air defenses are also a factor, but dont fully explain the nearly comatose state of the Russian airforce in this war.",False,1664815256.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqwfoyz,,1,20,0,20,0,0,

Threading very carefully. Despite initial bombardment and usage of tools to destroy Ukraine‚Äôs air defenses, a lot them failed. Ukraine, being a part of Soviet Union in the past, had one of the best AA capabilities and coverage in Europe. They degraded over time, but remained strong enough to deter, and outright stop Russian air forces from dominating Ukrainian space, keeping it contested 7 months in to war. It is estimated that we lost about 40% of our radar coverage, and up to 35% of our rockets/launchers since the start of the war. 

We are now being provided with western handheld AA systems, such as Stinger, Starstreak and more. These systems, in combination with the dangers that Ukrainian AA provides to enemy aircraft, makes Ukraine one of the hardest targets to fly over and perform combat duties in the world. IF you do not have specialized tech, and munitions to counter those dangers, such as F-35 from USA. 

Luckily Russians own ""stealth"" 5 generation fighter, was not produced in needed numbers, and is not used in this conflict. Russians simply lack the tools needed to gain air dominance in Ukraine, and to complete their objectives relatively safe. 

Situation can improve for us in Ukraine, if promised NASAMS and other western AA systems get here in time and in needed numbers. It can also degrade, if a steady flow of western hand-held AA systems (like Stingers) stops. 

There is a wast array of tools US and allies can provide to Ukraine to fortify our AA forces against Russian threats. I hope they will be provided to us in the future to keep russian aviation at bay.",False,1664815296.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqwfoyz,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

**Anti Air -** Time and again proven to be compromised/mainly rubbish both in mainline systems and MANPADS.  Ukraine resupplied Mariupol for over a month by air whilst the city was totally surrounded.  That route was only found by dumb luck in the end. Abysmal failure

**Intelligence -** There has been a distinct lack of it throughout.  Very few genuine behind the lines targets have been hit.  Ukraine seem to have faked them out over and over with good decoys and they have wasted crazy amounts of very expensive difficult to replace rockets on nothing. 

**Long Range Rockets -** They've just about used it all.  They have dragged in some Iskander systems from God knows where just recently towards Kherson.  You can expect these to be blindly fired at civilian targets that they think ""might"" be housing Ukrainian ammo dumps or command posts.  There has been a complete lack of evidence of many of these being hit in the seven months to date.  There has been a lot of evidence of civilian infrastructure being hit by the Iskanders and their ilk. 

**Artillery -** Once HIMARS got involved with disrupting supply chains - Failure,  It has still been pretty strong in the Bakhmut/Southern Dnoetsk region.  Expect to see this diminish as more held territory comes into HIMARS range and supply routes are compromised by the Northern Donetsk Ukrainian offensive 

**Infantry -** There are some good ones and well trained ones despite all the mocking of them and Wagner now are their defacto army,  they are pretty effective in the main - the new troops are pretty laughable in equipment and training however and most of the main Infantry is nowhere near what you would expect to see from Mainline Western armies.  The UA special forces are having an absolutely field day and have been since the start - overall failure and likely to get much worse. 

**Navy -** They have been taken out of the war by a country *with no Navy* \- Resounding failure

**Propoganda -** It's always been their one main strength and something they used incredibly well against Western democracies.  I feel like this is starting to turn against them now as well as they have highlighted quite how dangerous their meddling can be. I would expect to see this theatre however become the largest threat as they realise militarily they are done. 

**Alliances -** They have just about destroyed any and all they had.  No one likes a loser and the countries they have bullied for son long have sensed their weakness and are circling. 

**Drones -** They have picked up a lot of Iranian tech and apparently might be able to manufacture themselves now.  This started strongly for them, it looks like UA have already managed to start jamming and bringing them down. 

**Technological arms race/innovation -** Drones brings us on to this.  I can't see anyone but UA winning this race now.  Russia has no chance of quick innovation.  Their industry isn't there and the sanctions are going to make it really tough to do any more.  Ukraine have proven time and again to be really really innovative and clever in their approaches in all fields of the war. 

**Nukes -** They have a lot.  Whether they work who knows? Whether they would ever fire them, who knows?  Frankly it has been used as a threat over and over to the point it has lost any effectiveness.  The West have called their bluff over and over and at this stage I would expect them to be more likely used internally then externally as the last throw of the dice in the coming coup.

Crimea has been a part of Ukraine for 68 years. That's a quite a lot of time in the modern age and I don't see why we should give Russia that just because they invaded, killed and tortured a bunch of people. Lots of things empires did were ""mistakes"" so weird to just classify this as that and a reason to hand a modern dictator his war loot.

This one is reasonable.

What does this mean? No defensive pacts with western nations? Swearing off NATO forever? No deals with Europe? Russia seems to think any workings with the west is being hostile to them so I'd be careful on how to define neutral and I think it's hard not to see it as pandering to Russia.

>The Poseidon (Russian: –ü–æ—Å–µ–π–¥–æ–Ω, ""Poseidon"", NATO reporting name Kanyon), previously known by Russian codename Status-6 (Russian: –°—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å-6), is an autonomous, nuclear-powered, and nuclear-armed unmanned underwater vehicle under development by Rubin Design Bureau, capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear payloads

>The Poseidon warhead can contaminate a large area with radiation. For this purpose, the Poseidon is speculated to be equipped with a cobalt bomb.[22][23] The Poseidon could be a radiological second strike weapon.

>Normal (not salted) thermonuclear weapons cause radioactive fallout primarily through neutron activation of material at the detonation site. Unless the detonation happens at low depths in shallow waters, an underwater detonation will have its fallout greatly reduced, except for at the surface immediately above, near the base surge. Much of the radioactivity will be deposited in the sea, and be carried by ocean currents.[26] Water (and air) will not form radioisotopes suitable for radiological warfare when neutron activated, however the dissolved salt will, and the seabed may.

>If used against an aircraft carrier battle group, the battle group would have reduced chances of defending itself against it. The drone could detonate its very large warhead at standoff range, and anti-submarine warfare units would have very little time to react because of the speed at which it travels.[27]

>The development includes also use of stealth technology, to elude acoustic tracking devices.[25][30][37] Poseidon uses a silent running strategy like other submarines. Its main stealth feature is its very low speed before it reaches the target area. Its high-speed mode activates upon reaching a short finish range (2‚Äì3 kilometers), when the probability of detection of the drone is considerably higher. It could travel for weeks toward enemy port cities, reaching high-speed only in the final stage.[36]",False,1664796424.0,t3_xu8xz4,t1_iqv9law,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Best case scenario they would need need a bomb roughly twenty times bigger than the tsar bomba (Aka the biggest bomb ever detonated.) to even begin to meet the same energy of the 40 meter height 2011 tsunami in Japan, and even that's being incredibly generous because just having the raw energy is not enough, you have to focus it in one direction. If you displace it over a full 360 then you have a large amount of energy loss. The 2011 tsunami was caused by a chunk of the planet pushing the ocean in one direction, a bomb would not/could not do that so you would have to increase the energy released by several times to make up for the loss.

Why this should remove your worries is as follows: Ukraine is able to quickly re-deploy their forces to concentrate offensive attacks on newly-discovered weak points in the Russian lines. If they've been this effective at doing this on offense, it's probably even easier to do it on defense given their access to intelligence.

It consists of brutalization by more senior conscripts, NCOs, and officers.

Do OCS while in college. Apply to law school, finish law school. Then you attend TBS, and then hit the fleet (Naval Justice School interim).

Now let's go back to that part when the guy was 20 and did OCS early while in college. The one perk marine lawyers get instead of having student loans paid is AFADB (active force active duty base date). This means that by the time they finish Naval Justice School and hit the fleet, most of them will be captains a year into hitting the fleet.

Even though they've only had basic military training (well, USMC. TBS is pretty comprehensive, but no fleet experience), here's these 28 year old Captains who technically have like a year of AD time, and one or two ribbons.

The nuclear issue doesn't impact Ukraine directly... vulnerable to missile strikes already anywhere in the country so it's not like they're concentrating resources in any one place where low yield weapons would have enough battlefield advantage to counterbalance losing allies immediately and for a long time and being subject to the largest and most unified economic sanctions in history. The perception that contributing to escalation by providing weapons risks nuclear escalation matters... but less and less as the countries with more on the line next door call the bluff (because they're screwed if the bluff works and better off if it's not a bluff to find out now than when Russia is in a position of strength and the world less united on this issue).

I guess Ukraine's realistic negotiating position whenever that happens will be demilitarizarion of contested areas and some long road to self determination... give time to rebuild with regions seeing what it's like to be able to buy and sell in the EU single market and also a low friction bilateral scheme with Russia. Schedule statewide self-determination referenda for +10 years based on who has established or re-established residency at +5 years. In this scenario, allowing this in the east is a trade-off for Russia allowing it in Crimea.

But, hasn't nuclear blackmail existed as long as the weapons themselves have? Honestly, it's a very complex problem humanity has built itself. I think the ""simplest,"" answer is nuclear de-armament, but is politically very complex.

I am not saying, ""the second Russia is losing (it sure looks like they are losing) it will launch nukes."" I am not trying to say that nuclear holocaust will occur if Russia loses. What I am saying, and I believe it is intellectually dishonest to completely ignore, is that Russia CAN blackmail with nukes. They can, they do, I mean how many times has a Russian politician in the last year brought them up?

I can't remember the US official's name but he basically said Russia sabre-rattling with nukes is apart of their defense doctrine, and historically, appears to be at least somewhat effective. 

Personally, I think the Russian Federation will collapse before they ever launch anything, but that's just my opinion. But to discount and ignore any possibility would be an example of Occam's Broom.

I'll tell you a story about my family. My father identified as Russian. A few years ago I was talking to his youngest brother and he told me ""We're Ukrainian"".

What's up with that?

Well, my father grew up in a household where the primary language was Russian. I remember going to visit Grandma, the children sat there quietly while Father and Grandma spoke to each other in Russian.

We went to a Russian Orthodox church and were part of a 'Russian-American' community.

But what about my uncle?

He's a (now very senior) local sports hero and he's written up in the local 'Ukranian Times' --  a newspaper for the Ukranian diaspora community.

I recently saw a death certificate for one of my father's uncles. His place of birth was listed as 'Austria' but I doubt that he would have told you that he was Austrian.

Identity is not a simple thing and it's not static. There will be fewer 'ethnic Russians' in Ukraine after the war. But Russia will continue to play its dirty tricks.

There will be people in Ukraine who have varying degrees of Russian identity. Some of those people will have a desire to 'be part of Russia'. Will they be a small minority? Sure, but not zero.

I live in a country that was nearly destroyed by a civil war over 150 years ago. In some parts of this country, that war is still simmering. The losing side of a war develops elaborate stories to explain why they lost and it's almost never because they were the bad guys.

If you wanted depression in a month, then I could give you an exact list of things you could do to end up depressed. As you said, it's a behavioural and chemical issue so it's just a matter of precipitating a certain state within the brain over time. If you drank for a month solid, you would become depressed. If a person who has religious beliefs started acting against those beliefs, they would become depressed. They could also work to change their beliefs over time so they weren't overly scrutinising certain behaviours. 

Helplessness is one of the main symptoms of depression and this idea that It's impossible to treat it is basically a mental disorder rationalising its own symptom. Smarter people are even better at rationalising that, as there are facts on their side, but the truth is that it will go away with the right behaviours and treatment.

Having said all of that, having natural resources does nothing to change the fact that the country is an underdeveloped junkyard and the world is moving towards renewable power at a faster and faster rate.

The location was at Mount Xingshi (ËààÂã¢Â±±), which is situated north of present-day Yang County, Shaanxi, and is now part of the Changqing National Nature Reserve. The battle was an attempt by Cao Shuang, the regent of Wei, to conquer Wei's rival state, Shu. It ended in complete failure.

He declared in the 90s that Western neoliberal democracies had won the societal game, which is patently false and we've experienced the crumbling of the neoliberal aspect of it since then, the rise of fascism is usually associated to a crisis of capitalism. We're definitely living in a slow burning crisis of capitalism: the rich got richer, some crumbles got fed down to us, the plebs, and we've been slowly squeezed by all the rent-seekers around us (landlords, subscription models vs owning stuff, etc.).

That's not something that happens in the United States of America. You might have lost some friends in 2003 by opposing the Iraq War in public. Maybe you didn't feel comfortable objecting to the war in a bar late at night. But you weren't risking going to prison, getting your house seized, or hell, being literally sent to the front line to die under an artillery barrage, as punishment for your views. A lot more Russians conscientiously object to this war than you're admitting. The problem is that they live in a literal dictatorship that can kill them or send them to jail or render their entire family homeless because of voicing that objection, so most of those people live in fear and are not going to express those views in public unless there is a critical mass of other people all doing it at once.

In aggregate, the vast majority of opposition to the Vietnam and Iraq Wars did not come from conscientious objectors. The driving force against Vietnam was ""I don't want to be fucking drafted to die in a goddamn jungle!"" And the driving force against Iraq came from emotional appeals for the fallen Americans who died in the policing / occupation, and from people bitching and moaning about the exorbitant dollar amount of the war.

 >The nutria (Myocastor coypus), also known as the coypu, is a large, herbivorous, semiaquatic rodent. Classified for a long time as the only member of the family Myocastoridae, Myocastor is now included within Echimyidae, the family of the spiny rats. The nutria lives in burrows alongside stretches of water, and feeds on river plant stems. Originally native to subtropical and temperate South America, it has since been introduced to North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, primarily by fur farmers.

Publicly, the white house has said that we (the U.S) will respond decisively if Russia nukes Ukraine. 

Intentionally ambiguous, but also quite clear.

Chemical weapons in Syria.. it was fuckin awful what happened to those people.  I don't want to understate that.   


But using a nuclear bomb, offensively, the only other time a nuke has ever been used for war, is a MUCH different kind of situation.  

Letting even a ""tacitcal"" nuclear bomb go unanswered is just plain stupid.  Inaction would essentially cement a new era of potential warfare, where using tactical nukes is all but allowed.   It was also make America, and NATO, look incredibly weak.  

Responding decisively, in other words, litteraly wiping Russias military off the map and hanging Putin in the streets, does two primary things:   One, it means you cannot use a ""small"" nuclear bomb and get away with it, under any circumstances.   Two, it'll show the world, mainly China, what NATO is capable of.    


I dont think I need to explain the difference of chemical weapons and nukes, especially during a time when most Americans didn't want anything else to do with the Middle East.    It was terrible, everyone knew that.   But so is war, and it's likely any military action would have escalated.

PayPal payout is what allowed him to get the ball rolling on his wealth, which led to the acquisitions of Tesla, Solar City, The Boring Company, Hyperloop, Starlink, SpaceX, and Neurolink. That isn't necessary a knock on him, as when you have money, it is *far easier* to acquire a market participant than it is to start new. So I will give him credit for the direction he was able to take the majority of those companies and disrupt stagnant industries.

Now, you could make an argument that his vision for those companies is what made them successful. But there's a big difference between being able to envision market direction and having the capital to brute force it a little to get it rolling versus being a genius.

To be clear, I am certain that you are correct that in Ukraine, to your experience, they pronounce it more like a g. And it's good to know; as I mentioned, I'd heard that before.

Basically, my Ukrainian is learned from:
1. Paternal grandmother from –ö–∞—Ä–ø–∞—Ç–∏
2. Paternal grandfather, dunno where he learned it
3. Father who learned it from his parents and from Ukrainian school in Poland
4. Ukrainian language tapes from I dunno where
5. Ukrainian school in Canada

All of these pronounce –≥ the same way as Google translate does. Which to me sounds like a soft h.

I also just visited Lviv in July, and also just went to a Ukrainian festival for charity in Denver, and when people said –≥–µ—Ä–æ—è–º —Å–ª–∞–≤–∞ (which was said a lot) I only heard ""h"".

I'd be interested, if you'd oblige, to type –õ—É–≥–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫ into Google translate, set to Ukrainian, and tell me whether that sounds like the way you'd pronounce it, or different?

Do you have ANY source for him threatening not applying article 5? I am Romanian and I watched this very closely, since for us article 5 is ...well...important. There were talks about this in the media (probably stoked by the media), but when our President went to meet him, he was plainly asked what his opinion is on  article 5, he gave a satisfactory answer that the US will protect the allies.

Don't underestimate them.  It's getting a lot sloppier lately, but they still have quite a few captive information outlets, and far too many news outlets just regurgitate ""both sides"" of an issue, rather than doing proper investigative journalism and figuring out the underlying truth.  I'm sure that's a good part of why the news seems out of sync with what you're personally seeing.
