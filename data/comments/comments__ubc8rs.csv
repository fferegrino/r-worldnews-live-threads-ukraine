Day 59, 60 and 61 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Those last 3 days were the worst yet. Just as 59th day was ending around 23:30 we heard one extremely loud explosion after which we ran to the bathroom, and that was just the beginning. Then after around 2 minutes the MLRS barrage started. This was the scariest thing we experienced during this war.

There were a lot of explosions and at least 2 of the rockets landed right on the roof of our apartment complex. One of them landed on our section of the building. It fucking broke through the roof of the building and into the maintenance/communications floor. It then proceeded to break the ceiling of the 12th floor apartment. The ceiling’s concrete panel fell into the apartment and left a hole to the sky, and of course rain started right after.

There was at least 1 (up to 3) person in there at that time. Miraculously nobody got hurt, they were probably also standing in the bathroom. Those explosions broke a lot of the windows on one side of the building, including ours, for some people the whole window frame fell out. The MLRS rockets landed in a really big area randomly, they destroyed some stores, a pharmacy and at least 3 cars, but most likely way more than 3 from what we heard. Firefighters got here around 5 minutes after the barrage and quickly extinguished the fires.

All our neighbors came to our flight of stairs and we were standing there for around 4 hours waiting for what might come next. Nothing else happened later that night, but in the morning most of our neighbors immediately left Kharkiv. We are still here, but now we will most likely also leave in the next couple of days, it’s not safe here anymore.

Yesterday we came out to go get drinking water and also looked around at the destruction that the “liberators” caused. [Here are some photos I took, some are of my broken windows (we already cleaned them up), of a big hole in a concrete fence (successfully demilitarized), and some of the destroyed windows from our buildings backyard.](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaberFlux/comments/ubtfy9/some_of_the_destruction_caused_by_mlrs_barrage/) I took more photos but I won’t post them all for now.

Previous night was also so loud it was almost impossible to sleep; we were constantly running to the bathroom because of the explosions nearby, with broken windows the sound is also much louder now. We mostly got used to the sound of explosions by now, but after that night we now again get very tense when we hear them.

All this just makes you feel so hopeless and empty, like you can’t really do anything and just have to endure, not knowing if the next explosion will happen next to you. Right now we are thinking about where to go now, we can only move to western Ukraine, but it’s hard to find a place to rent there and we don’t even have money to rent.

**Edit:** I'm really grateful to everyone for worrying about us and offering help, it really means a lot, and also sorry for not answering to everyone, I still do read everything and really appreciate it. For people asking about how they can help us, I'll look into ways of being able to donate to us tomorrow.

**Russia yet to achieve significant breakthrough - UK MoD**

  
We're getting the latest intelligence report on Ukraine from the UK's Ministry of Defence. It says Russia has ""made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas"".  
  
But it says that ""without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough"".  
  
It continues: ""Russia’s decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant means many Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed. Ukraine’s defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness.  
  
""Russia’s Ministry of Defence has proposed compensation payments for the families of deceased service personnel be overseen by military rather than civilian officials. This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia’s losses from the domestic population.""

*WASHINGTON: The invite list for a high-level military meeting around Ukraine, hosted Tuesday in Germany by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, includes 14 non-NATO nations ranging from Japan to Kenya to Israel, according to planning documents viewed by Breaking Defense.*  
  
*All told, 43 countries, including all NATO members, were invited to the meeting at Ramstein Air Force Base, where the US will make a push for how allies and partners can come together to best support Ukraine’s ongoing defense against Russia.*  
  
*Current plans, according to a source familiar with the discussions, are for four of those nations to attend remotely, with representatives from the other 38 all coming in person. Some will be represented by their civilian ministers of defense, while others will be sending chiefs of defense; a few countries, including the US, may have both in attendance. (Of course, attendance plans may change by the time the event actually happens.)*

Explosion in Russian-occupied Kreminna results in casualties, Ukrainian official says
From CNN's Kostan Nechyporenko and Tim Lister

A senior official in Ukraine's Interior Ministry says there has been a large explosion in the town of Kreminna in the Luhansk region, an area recently occupied by Russian forces.

Anton Gerashchenko said the explosion took place at an administrative building in the town. Ukrainian forces withdrew from Kreminna last week.

""As a result of a gas explosion in the city council's building in Kreminna, no one survived,"" he said on Telegram. 
""Simultaneously with the natural gas explosion in the building of the city council, there was a second explosion of domestic gas in the district police department, where a group of collaborators had gone for a meeting,"" he said.

>@Aftonbladet has, however, spoken to several sources with deep insight into the preparatory work for a possible NATO application and the picture that emerges is that Sweden would in no way stand alone before a possible application was approved.

>The government has received information from, among others, the United States and the United Kingdom about what the protection and support during a possible application process can look like, says a government source.

>The source states that the Government Offices are carrying out the same analysis as the former ambassador Krister Bringéus has expressed, that in practice Sweden will be treated as a full-fledged NATO member shortly after a declaration of interest.

>Another transparent source indicates that NATO countries such as the United States, under the rules of the Defense Alliance, Article 8 of the Washington Treaty, are prevented from expressing any formal guarantees of protection to non-members.

>To the extent that there is an impressionable situation for Russia, it is probably really until now that we submit the application. It is their ""window of opportunity"", says a source with insight.

>A government source states that there has been an irritation in the Government Offices over information in articles from DN and Expressen where Sweden and Finland are pointed out for lacking a guarantee of protection during an application process.

>This is because it risks contributing to fragmentation and insecurity in a sensitive situation, according to the source.

>The Armed Forces' command staff and the Ministry of Defense have confirmed that this weakens the threshold-raising Swedish security policy signals, says the government source.

""The explosions in the Transnistrian region are a planned provocation by the Russian special services. Document
April 25, 2022

A series of explosions erupted in the capital of the unrecognized Transnistrian Moldavian Republic (TMR) on April 25 at about 5:45 p.m. They took place in the premises of the offices of the local ""Ministry of State Security"" and the branch of the Russian ""Federal Security Service"" in Transnistria.

As a result of the incident, the building was damaged and the windows were broken. There are objects on the street near the room. Presumably used RPG-22 and RPG-27.

However, this event did not come as a surprise to the PMR leadership. On April 22, Vadym Shmalenko, secretary of the State Commission for Emergency Situations of the Transnistrian Region, wrote a letter to the head of the Kamensky district, Volodymyr Bychkov. It was about the urgent (until 16.00 on the same day) preparation of information on the availability and location of ""protected point of civil defense of the city."" Indicating:

- Name of the object;

- Accommodation addresses;

- Type of protective structure

In the absence of such an item, the question of its urgent creation was raised.

That is, three days before the incident, the leaders of ""PMR"" were already preparing for it and took care of the installation of a secure and comfortable bunker.

It is obvious that this case is one of a number of provocative measures organized by the FSB to instill panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment. According to the authors, they should justify the war on the territory of Ukraine or involve the Transnistrian region in hostilities. Either as a territory with a certain mobilization reserve, or as a territory from which Russian troops can carry out attacks on Ukrainian territory.

We remind you that on April 22, Deputy Commander of the Central Military District of the Russian Federation, Major General Rustam Minnekayev announced plans for an unrecognized ""Transnistrian region"". He said that the Russian army has the task of ""establishing full control over Donbass and southern Ukraine."" After that, the occupiers must break through the corridor to the unrecognized ""Transnistrian region"", where ""the facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population are noted.""

According to available information, the FSB will continue a series of provocative terrorist attacks on the territory of the Transnistrian region.""

But the gas is mostly in Algeria. Algeria is an ally of Russia. At least, they used to be, they’ve been extremely quiet about Ukraine, so who knows now. Maybe they’re wising up?



The reason Algeria has huge un-tapped gas reserves is because they never developed them. They never developed them because Russian foreign policy has been to stop gas development outside of Russia.

I don't think it is ANY coincidence this happened immediately after a high-level visit from US officials to Ukraine.  If Ukraine hit it they told the US they were going to and got the green light.  If they were planning on hitting it they would have discussed it today no doubt.  There is no plausible way to 'blame Ukraine' for this by the Russians that Europe would believe if Ukraine didn't actually do it.  And if they did actually do it, they likely cleared it.

The initial transshipment capacity of oil loading terminal, equipped with the facilities that meet the world’s technological and environmental standards, is 5 million tons of feed in a year, to eventually be expanded to 7 million tons. The terminal’s infrastructure also includes a 19.7 km oil trunk pipeline and a tank farm whose vessels store more than 60 thousand tons of crude, oil delivery-oil acceptance station from OAO Transneft, a modern automated on-spot station. Production facilities are located on an area of 62 ha.

In the course of the terminal construction at Zhecha a railway station building was erected and the railway lines at the stations of Zhecha and Unecha including the span between them were reinstated. Today Zhecha is a contemporary station with 12 receiving-and-departure tracks, dead-end and team tracks equipped with block route control interlocking system.

The oil loading terminal being the biggest investment project of the region means new jobs for the local population, more taxes in the local budget, favorable conditions for developing new kinds of activities in the area and rapid development of social and engineering infrastructure.""

*First comes the dehumanization. Then comes the killing.*  
By Anne Applebaum

**Atlantic article, soft paywall - worth a read.**

[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/06/ukraine-mass-murder-hate-speech-soviet/629629/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/06/ukraine-mass-murder-hate-speech-soviet/629629/)

IMO, key paragraphs:

>**\[During the Holomodor\] Some 4 million died of starvation.**  
>  
>**\[Communist\] activists felt no guilt.** Soviet propaganda had repeatedly told them that supposedly wealthy peasants, whom they called kulaks, were saboteurs and enemies—rich, stubborn landowners \[who should be\] crushed like parasites or flies.   
>  
>**The relationship between genocidal language and genocidal behavior is not automatic or even predictable. ... But while not every use of genocidal hate speech leads to genocide, all genocides have been preceded by genocidal hate speech.**  
>  
>From the first days of the war... **Russian military planned in advance for many civilians, perhaps millions, to be killed, wounded, or displaced** from their homes in Ukraine... In the first week of the war, Russian missiles and artillery targeted apartment blocks, hospitals, and schools.  
>  
>\[Russia propaganda\] stressed the dehumanization of the Ukrainians \[in\] an article arguing that the “de-Nazification” of Ukraine would require the “liquidation” of the Ukrainian leadership, and even the erasure of the very name of Ukraine,  
>  
>\[Re **Mauripol**\]One television anchorwoman, sounding sad, described the scene as **“a horrifying picture. \[Ukrainian\] nationalists, as they retreat, are trying to leave no stone unturned.”**   
>  
>**All of this—the indifference to violence, the amoral nonchalance about mass murder, even the disdain for the lives of Russian soldiers—is familiar to anyone who knows Soviet history**

The parallels to today, to the rise of right-wing extremism everywhere, of Putin's right-hand neo-nazi man Dugin.... 

For example, I just read a passage about how Hitler in the years leading up to the blitz and in eroding the Treaty of Versailles went on a speech tour, promoting the modernization of Germany, of how Germany wants nothing but peace and how, ""war does nobody any good but only serves to hurt the people..."" and ""what good ever comes from it!?""... This can be comparable to Putin's lead-up to his increasing acts of aggression in Chechyna, Georgia, Crimea, and so on. When Putin became ""Time Person of the Year"" and hosted the Sochi Olympics.

Vladimir Putin should leave all occupied territory in Ukraine including Crimea for true peace to be achieved, the UK Defence Secretary has suggested, as he said it is up to Ukraine what a resolution to the war would look like.

Commons Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood asked: ""What does success in Ukraine look like? Are we doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to make sure that they win? What is our strategy?

""Is it to push Russia back from the pre-February lines or indeed liberate the entire Donbas region? If it is in Europe's wider security interest to see Putin humiliated in Ukraine then the entire mainland must be liberated, that must be our strategic end.""

Ben Wallace replied: ""Our strategic aim is twofold. One is that Putin must fail in Ukraine, he must fail in his invasion and I think he is on course to do that actually. He must fail in his occupation of Ukraine and I think he has definitely failed in achieving that.

""To the fine tuning of that, that is as much a matter of Ukraine's choice as it is of anybody else - that Ukraine gets to choose where it wishes to settle for peace. We will do everything we can to support them.

Russia has enough nukes to wipe out humanity, and yet he managed to get into a position where the entire world is being upfront about grinding down Russia's military by supplying intel, weapons, and buckets of money to Ukraine.

Russia used their nukes to keep NATO troops out of Ukraine, which worked... but then the whole world called their bluff on every other threat of nuclear war.

How frustrating must it be to know that all of NATO is supplying weapons to be used directly against you, and that they are closely tracking how depleted your military is becoming. Grinding it down to neuter you.

And of course, the countries that now feel compelled to join NATO, and the NATO countries increasing their defense budget.

I'll bet the rumors are true that Putin is dying, and he jumped the gun to try and bring back the USSR as part of his legacy. And if I was a Russian official who wanted exactly that, I'd be so pissed that Putin rushed it and screwed them over.

> **At the same time, he stressed that Russia fundamentally considers nuclear war unacceptable.** “This is our principled position, we proceed from it, and, of course, I would very much not like that now, when the risks are very, very significant, I would very much not like these risks to be artificially inflated, and there are many who want them. The danger is serious, it is real, it cannot be underestimated.”

This is what else he said. And this is something you can actually believe from Russia. No one wins in a nuclear war, and they understand it as good as anyone else. 

What he is doing right now, though, is to saber rattle.

But there is a wide range of actions between „go storm Kreml” and „repeat propaganda with smile”.

While Poland fought with Russian-forced communist government not all of Poles were heroes, that is for sure. But there were many examples to express your dislike towards the government without getting in trouble. Some examples:
- talkung to family and friends, especially those who believed in propaganda. We did it in our kitchens with tap water running if one was afraid of police, it was believedonly water would be heard in their recording;
- ostentatevily walking around your block just the minute main propaganda audition started. Many people did that, that built the feeling of comunity and no you want get arrested for just walking around the block ;)
- making unpolitical graffities and comments with blink of the eye. Like a manifestation claiming they were supporting secret service went through Wrocław making police uneasy.

- storming places which were legal but disliked by government - gov did not like catholic church so poles would go to mass every sunday back then ;)

Sorry I do not get this approach that „if i am not able to stop putin single- handed i would rather just sit there and repeat his propaganda”.

MOSCOW, April 25 - RIA Novosti. The risks of nuclear war are now very significant, this danger cannot be underestimated, but there are many who are willing to artificially inflate this threat, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Channel One.
He recalled that in January the countries of the ""nuclear five"" reaffirmed the thesis about the inadmissibility of the use of these weapons.
""This is our principled position. We proceed from it. And I would very much not like that now, when, as you said, referring to respected political scientists, when the risks are really very, very significant, I would very much not like these risks to be artificially were inflated, and there are many who want them. The danger is serious, it is real, it cannot be underestimated,"" the head of Russian diplomacy said.
He also expressed hope that Western countries would not allow their troops to be sent to Ukraine. 
""In no case should we allow a third world war, it is in this context that they consider the constant provocations of Zelensky and his team, who demand almost the introduction of NATO troops in order to protect the Ukrainian government. And everyone always says that we will give weapons - which, of course, also adds fuel to the fire - and they want to force the Ukrainians to fight with Russia to the last soldier with these arms deliveries, if only this conflict dragged on longer, if only, as they hope, Russia would suffer from it more and more and more,"" Lavrov said.

Germany should give permission for the Leopard 1 sales, and Ukraine should consider taking them up on it.

Disclaimer: I'm an enthusiast and have just spent a couple hours with open source info with both theoretical numbers and real ones recorded. This is for us to discuss in theory, not to be handed to Zelenskyy as serious advice.

Many people will, rightly, point out that the Leopard 1 is an old, and potentially flawed, design. There is no way a stock Leopard 1 will win a fair fight against most anything short of a T-34 monument in a park.

But: They aren't stock. Presumably the ones Rheinmetall/Porche have in storage aren't stock. They are quite likely at least Leopard 1A4s. Probably A5s.

Still you say: ""It only has a 105mm gun, that will struggle with the turret or front armor of the latest Russian tanks.""

Again: You aren't wrong, but Russia has rolled out a wide variety of tanks ranging over the last 60 years. And their latest and greatest don't appear to be present in great numbers (or at all, in the case of the T-14). Additionally, some of the late generation NATO APFSDS and HEAT rounds start being competitive even against the turret and front of T-80 and late T-72.

Finally: Who said anything about a fair fight? Ukraine appears to have the intelligence advantage with drones capable of live video. The Chieftain (US armored officer, now historian on Youtube) pointed out that the side armor of an M1 Abrams could be penetrated by WWII tanks. Modern tanks are very front armor focused (checked in War Thunder armor viewer when Wikipedia didn't get me the details and I wasn't going to shell out of Jane's).

A Leopard 1A5, in an ambush or otherwise skewed fight will be perfectly sufficient to fight Russian armor. To say nothing of it engaging lighter AFVs, infantry, or generally any other place a tank is handy to have.

A group of “neo-Nazis” were planning to kill Solovyov under the orders of Ukraine’s Security Services, according to an FSB statement.     
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the arrest of the would-be assassins during a meeting at Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office.

**If** and especially **if** they weren’t just coincidence or for whatever mundane reasons, I think the bigger picture *could* indicate an ongoing trend of attempts at sabotage, by the Ukrainian government and/or the West. That does *not* mean they murdered the oligarchs. Rather, it could be possible there were secret arrangements for those oligarchs to go against Putin’s government, but Putin somehow found out, and uhhh… put a kibosh in that side of the operation.

Edit: for everyone saying the recent fires and damage were probably just Ukrainian soldiers or local opportunists, that would explain the sudden escalation (until now, such attacks were relatively rare after the war started) **but** it does **not** explain the string of murders of oligarchs and their families. Some of them weren’t even in Russia when they died.

Everyday if they attack they might ware down down the Ukrainian forces and surprise them with a massive attack. This also allows them to keep their supply lines more in tact and less stretched.

I think this is the Russian strategy. The new artillery needs to get their as fast as possible and in huge numbers. 

There has also been a sizable uptick in the amount of videos of Ukrainian losses in the past couple days.

My biggest fear is this becomes a Finland situation where even though Ukraine performs well on the battlefield they eventually get ground down due to the sheer numbers of Russians and the fact the have more AirPower and artillery.

Also the air defenses in the Donbass don’t seem to be working well for Ukraine? Shouldn’t they have as many s300 units there as possible? Why are Russian planes/helis doing 300 sorties a day?

At what point would Ukrainian strikes inside Russia become according to Russias nuke doctrine 'aggression against Russia with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is threatened', and therefore give them reason to use WMDs?

And if Ukraine are using missiles, aircraft etc. to carry out these attacks that were donated from NATO would Russia see this as a NATO attack on russian soil?

Poland should have refugee things set up so not much money needed. Works around the money issues, stresses of getting a new place and an income and might be safer. Might also be Ukraine government relocation programs in Ukraine?

I would get a map (digital), food and water (car issues, etc... might have to walk a bit) and fill up the vehicle with gas and head straight to Poland with no unnecessary stops (check tires, spare tire, oil etc...). Stick to main roads that have lots of travellers and are more likely to be safe (land mines). Road safety reports? Basically play the odds in your favour.

Some train stations hit with retaliatory attacks for the oil refinery and military depot in Russia. Seems normal that they do this. So if you are taking a train look at reddits live news and stuff. If there has been an attack in Russia then stations might be getting hit that morning/day. Need to balance the risks I guess.

RussNeft-Bryansk runs the operation of oil loading terminal in the Bryansk region near the railway station of Zhecha in order to deliver-by-railway crude oil to the Republic of Belarus, Baltic States and Eastern Europe. The initial transshipment capacity of oil loading terminal, equipped with the facilities that meet the world’s technological and environmental standards, is 5 million tons of feed in a year, to eventually be expanded to 7 million tons. The terminal’s infrastructure also includes a 19.7 km oil trunk pipeline and a tank farm whose vessels store more than 60 thousand tons of crude, oil delivery-oil acceptance station from OAO Transneft, a modern automated on-spot station. Production facilities are located on an area of 62 ha.

Hard to say exactly.

IMO, BMPs are almost certainly dead. BMP is an IFV, a ""glass cannon"" of sorts, designed for high-offensive capabilities but very little armor.

Tanks are a complicated story. Their armor is well designed and very thick. Even if the tank is disabled, there's a chance the crew survives. Especially if you hit the frontal-armor of the tank (the strongest, thickest armor of the tank)

-----------

The #1 effect is Spalling: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spall

As you can see in the GIF, the ""shockwave"" of the round hits the armor like a Newton's Cradle. There is a chance that the ""shockwave"" causes the internal armor to splinter and turn into fragments, killing people inside of the tank.

Tank armor designers do a lot of materials engineering, chemical / material science, geometry and simulations to minimize spalling.

This GIF cartoon makes spall very obvious: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation#/media/File:Spallation.gif

Russia wants a pretext to (a) use those troops plus Russian-backed Transnistrian rebel forces - Russian speaking Moldovans - to push east into Ukraine toward Odesa and (b) if they do get the whole southern part of Ukraine, cutting it off from the sea, to then use that land corridor to invade Moldova in similar fashion to the invasion of Ukraine.

The real test is the Ukrainian counter-attack, which seems inevitable. But attacking is very difficult and the ""KD-ratio"" will be tilted in favor of the Russians (defending land is far easier than attacking the enemy).

So as Ukraine goes from a defensive shift to an offensive-shift, I expect more of Ukrainian's soldiers to die in the coming battles. That's where the real test will be.

With any luck, we'll have given Ukraine enough good weapons to sustainably push an offensive and push Russia back to... some point? I don't know exactly what Ukraine wants here, but hopefully Ukraine can recapture the entire East and maybe even threaten recapturing Crimea.

But a sustainable push takes time, and will take weeks/months to execute (assuming the Russian front doesn't collapse). So its a big question if Ukraine can do it.

First, Russia doesn’t have a history of military/internal coups, for one. 

Second, Putin has removed everybody who is even remotely different from him (and would see the devastation that Russia is going to endure for this war they started) and kept/replaced the people who are exactly like him. Less chances there that his own compatriots would take Putin down. 

Third, he is so paranoid that I believe he has an army worth of people, for whom he is literally the commander of the force. His personal protection basically. 

Fourth, there is no public support for his takedown and he is still veneered as the man that brought Russia out of the swamp of the 90s. Make a wrong move with the takedown and you’ll get the angry public hating you before you’re even in position for taking down the man they believe has been the best leader for Russia. 

Fifth, unlike USSR, Russia today doesn’t have an apparatus and a line of men who can take over. Realistically, who could it be? Medvedev? He is 100% behind Putin. Shoigu? Doubt that. 

With all of that said though… if Russia continues to spiral downwards as expected and the sanctions/lack of certain goods really starts to bite, I’d expect the grumbling to start amongst the people. Would they, however, go out and protest or link their president to the sanctions, I’m still doubtful.

7eeb8f24fbe36461df0b6b9268079e25,ubc8rs,i63dq91,"> Zakaria proposes difficult idea to keep pressure on Putin

Historically this has 2 problems:

- OPEC is a cartel meant to price fix, and only flood the market if there is competition (like Mexico, or US shale). This has been the case since the 1970s and 80s, where OPEC used their oil as a weapon against the US and Mexico.

- OPEC is also divided among religious and ethnic lines, with Arabic countries allowed to do what they pleased by a country like Venezuela did not get this same treatment. This was a major reason Mexico rejected joining OPEC, OPEC only wanted to put controls on nations outside the region of Saudi Arabia so prices stay high.

Now as you can see, OPEC wouldn't want to lower their prices to benefit Ukraine because their only goal is to price fix. They will do whatever it takes to ensure their monopoly stands on the top of other people's sacrifice, even if that person is a fellow OPEC member. OPEC got into a price war with Russia and only called it off due to Covid 19.

There is one thing going for this though:

- High prices are a double edged sword. OPEC loves high prices, but not so high the US shale producers can turn a profit and ween the US off OPEC oil.

So in order for OPEC to agree, it would likely rely on the US sacrificing shale which would put the US back onto the path of relying on Saudi Oil. With America wanting to step AWAY from the Middle East, this is a hard ask especially with how badly Russia is losing. It would also likely rely on the nuclear deal with Iran stopping, which would stop Iranian oil from going into the global market.

Like the US would think Russia is losing so badly and can't keep the war effort up for long that it would be pointless to sacrifice shale to end the war that is quickly ending anyway, and to not try to restart nuclear talks with Iran.

Considering this is a month old with no follow up other than shouting matches over the murder, I have a feeling OPEC isn't going to do anything.

The reason Odesa was never attacked is because the Russians got pushed back from Mykolaiv. To establish a corridor to Moldova they need to push west, all the way past Odesa. To do that they need to first take Mykolaiv and then Odesa. They maybe had a chance of that early in the war if they'd successfully taken Mykolaiv and moved quickly on to Odesa, but at this point Odesa has had two months to prepare and reinforce, and the reality on the ground is that the Russian military has shown itself to be incapable of successfully assaulting and holding even Mykolaiv.

The reality for Russia is that their military relies on air superiority to support ground troops based on around tanks and other armored infantry. Mykolaiv is almost a worst case scenario for their military. It's a city established on a peninsula jutting in to an estuary of a river that flows in to the Black Sea. It's very difficult to use heavy, armored vehicles to assault the city. Because of this, the Russian army was and is severely handicapped in trying to take it. They attempted to go around it, but doing so stretched their supply lines even further, across a river, and left them vulnerable to attacks from their flanks. They also can't leave Mykolaiv uncontested in their rear while assaulting Odesa, as that would leave an entrenched enemy position on their flank.

More importantly Bush assembled a ""coalition"".  British marines were in there kicking down doors.  Iceland, Mongolia, Costa Rica.   Absolutely no other country is joining Russia.  We can point fingers at Germany buying gas, India buying fertilizer, and China lurking. No one sent Putjn any real support.  Russia attacked through Belarus but that is not joining a coalition.  

Second difference is not trivial.  USA never intended to annex or break off any part of Iraq.  The intent from day one was to form an independent Iraqi government.  It obviously was an oil grab.  But Baghdad was always going to legislate Iraqi law. 

Third is WMD.  It was obvious to me at the time that the Bush administration was at least exaggerating the risk.  As it turned out WMD was completely fabricated lie.  Humanity has to work on removing WMD.  There are good ways and bad ways to do this.  Ukraine had nuclear weapons and ICBMs and cruise missiles. Ukraine removed or dismantled their nuclear arsenal.  That gives Ukraine special status.  Ukraine needs to win this fight now in order for there to be a safe world in the next two centuries.  It is not ""just"" Democracy, though there is that too, human survival requires that nuclear arms do not always proliferate. The Bush administration is guilty of a crime.

They've been calling out Russia's moves days, or even weeks before it makes them. As well as announcing to the world that they are sending weapons to help Ukraine, and giving updates on what they know of the Russian military status.

They \*might\* be able to launch one small nuke at Ukraine without suffering a full-blown nuclear war, but the outcome still sucks for Russia. And that's assuming Putin's men do not refuse the order and turn on him, and that NATO does not have the capability to stop the nuke from reaching its target.

But it is a sure thing that NATO has a very clear action plan for what to do if Russia launches a nuke, and I'll bet it involves rapid, precision strikes to take out all known nuclear silos and any means of Putin ordering more launches.

&#x200B;

Launching nukes is a bluff. It's a scary enough bluff that everyone has to take it seriously, but still a bluff. Because it is guaranteed suicide for whoever does it. That's why you don't see Russia going beyond vague threats. And why you don't get Putin making ultimatums where he nukes NATO countries if they supply any more weapons to Ukraine. And he is not playing games where he initiates launch sequences, or launches dummy nukes towards Ukraine to make NATO sweat.

&#x200B;

If Russia were heavily counter-attacked, on the other hand, and at risk of being conquered... I could see nukes flying. Instead they are moving goalposts and shrinking their ambitions in preparation for declaring victory regardless of if they achieve anything.

&#x200B;

As it is now, Russia's nukes keep out NATO troops, and give Russia some chance of ending the war with Ukrainian territory. It's the only way they have any chance of ""winning"".

Don't flatter yourself, nobody wants to hate on Russia. It's just that Russia's behavior towards other countries is so despicable, so aggressive, so immoral, so nasty, that it is very difficult for other countries to be friendly towards it.

Ukraine has gone all in with everything that they have in the east, if they fail and get encircled then their army is done. 
On the contrary, if they succeed and push back the Russian before they can properly finish the ongoing redeployment of troops then it's their army that will be done for. Which for a country like Russia could mean anything, even civil war. 
Or there is the third option, none can make a decisive push in the next weeks, the war loses momentum and it will be dragged for months without major gains on both sides.

On paper all these rockets and guns and vehicles cost a lot of money, but, well: five thousand NLAWs in an arsenal in England are a fine thing to have, if we fear that one day the Russians will march west and we'll need to fight them close up on some European city street. That's why we made them, that's why we paid for them: we thought one day we might have to fight the Battle of Warsaw and there we would need the right weapons to blast a great many Russian tanks to pieces.

But five thousand NLAWs on a battlefield in Ukraine are a far better thing to have, because in Ukraine it's not a hypothetical but a present reality. Here the Russians are, here is the war. The rockets we made to blow up Russian armour are being used every day to do exactly that. Every Russian tank destroyed in the Battle of Kyiv is a Russian tank that will never again menace us with the prospect of the Battle of Warsaw, so I'd say the purpose for which we made those weapons - to uphold the security of Europe - is being totally fulfilled. If England is left with no NLAWs and Russia is left with no tanks, that's the finest bargain we could ever have asked for. And if we didn't send them to the fight, they'd only have sat in that arsenal gathering dust until the day came to replace them with something newer, and meanwhile Russia victorious might indeed have turned a menacing eye towards Poland. The price of the rockets is a sunk cost we're never getting refunded anyway; but the destruction of the Russian army is a prize!

As for China? They were never going to threaten Europe with a tank war. Taiwan is their target, and their hopes for seizing the island rest on the idea that, first, the West will not materially support friendly small countries that defy unfriendly great powers, and second, that Western equipment is not so greatly superior to their own Russian or Russian-derived hardware.

I remember discussions happening in public on CNN in the 1990s.  Iraq's foreign minister (Tariq Aziz?) was arguing that even though some of the bombs were concrete it was nonetheless bombing in an urban area and dangerous for civilians.  Air Force generals retorted that Iraq should not be placing radar or air defense in urban areas.  Iraq claimed the ajr defense was to defend the people.  It has been a long time and hard to remember details you can probably imagine the general outline.  

Then some congresspeople decided to intervene.  They started protesting in speeches about the pentagon/Clinton administration's reckless endangerment of our pilots.  They were outraged that the Air Force would make pilots carry concrete instead of real bombs.  This went on for a little while.  

Then the Air Force changed stories.  The General interviewed on CNN clarified that they wanted the concrete bombs.  A packed bundle of rebar has momentum.  It smashes through a wall and crushes anything behind.  Electronic equipment gets damaged by explosive bombs but iraqis could usually salvage many of the components and use them again in air defense.  Crushed electronics were completely useless and not recoverable.  

My impression is that some people may be trying to do the right thing.  USA is still capable of doing some profound evil.  The pressure should not be let up.

> Roosevelt believed that if the Soviets were defeated the Allies would be far more likely to lose. Roosevelt concluded that the United States needed to help the Soviets fight against the Germans.

> ...

> In total, the U.S. deliveries to the USSR through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials: over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386[57] of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans);[58] 11,400 aircraft (4,719 of which were Bell P-39 Airacobras)[59] and 1.75 million tons of food.[60]

> Roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment, vehicles, industrial supplies, and food were shipped from the Western Hemisphere to the USSR, 94% coming from the US. For comparison, a total of 22 million tons landed in Europe to supply American forces from January 1942 to May 1945. It has been estimated that American deliveries to the USSR through the Persian Corridor alone were sufficient, by US Army standards, to maintain sixty combat divisions in the line.[61][62]",False,1650867964.0,t3_ubc8rs,t1_i63km7y,,3,16,0,16,0,0,

Not commenting on this particular incident so much as generally, because I think you’re probably right in this instance, but the first part isn’t entirely true. 

Old Soviet propaganda was to simply present a single alternative narrative. But Soviet people weren’t stupid. They figured out pretty quickly when they were being lied to. If the paper said A was true, you could more or less count on the truth being something other than A.

Modern Russian propaganda is more about overwhelming people with multiple different narratives so no one knows what to believe. Dazzle camouflage - throw the truth out there along with ten different lies, see what sticks.

A good example is the foiled “Chechen” apartment bombing. Multiple conflicting statements directly from the police, Duma, FSB and Putin about what happened. It was a real bombing and the police were heroes... oh wait it was a only an exercise... there were no explosives, only sugar... no the bomb was real...etc. It quickly got so convoluted that no ordinary person knew what to believe. But it sure succeeded in making everyone angry and afraid enough to manufacture consent for a military solution in Chechnya. 

So a false flag could and probably would be presented in a number of different narratives in order to soften up the public and cover any inconsistencies. They might stage a series of escalating events, but downplay the early ones. Put the seed of doubt in people that Ukraine can strike within Russia, but make the government appear reticent to enact a mass mobilization until enough of the public (fed by state media) are openly calling for it. Then you appear like a reasonable President pushed to make a difficult choice.

All that said, I still agree with your overall assessment, since the targets hit seem too strategically valuable to waste in a false flag.",False,1650870367.0,t3_ubc8rs,t1_i63emr6,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

You provide Ukraine every means of obliterating invading forces any and all methods just short of boots on the ground so that it can't be interpreted as a western invasion force determined to push across the border.

However, because Ukraine gave notice that it accepts their jurisdiction, the ICC can try other war crimes that are alleged to have been perpetrated by Russia on Ukrainian soil.

Consequently, whilst we'd all like to see Russia held to account for the crime of aggression, there is no framework (besides Russia's voluntary submission to the court's jurisdiction, which obviously won't happen) under which that can occur.

Standard protective measures include a blend of steel and composite armour, smoke grenade dischargers, Kontakt-5 explosive-reactive armour and the Shtora infrared ATGM jamming system  The T-90 was designed and built by Uralvagonzavod, in Nizhny Tagil, Russia. The Russian Army curtailed purchases of the T-90 beginning in 2012.

This would be highly unpopular, and I’m pretty sure Putin operates/operated under the assumption it was not needed.

I think it’s becoming clear now that Russia cannot win this without mass mobilization. With each week, it will become less likely that they can win even with mobilization, as military support from the West is accelerating at the moment. Once Western equipment starts arriving at mass, and Ukraine sorts their logistics so they are able to quickly make it operational and start pushing it to the eastern front Russia will be struggling even with mobilization.

If it remains a “special military operation”, I think in the next few weeks Russia will have to withdraw from Donbas and Ukraine will start focusing on recapturing Crimea.

1. During the siege of Kyiv, western intelligence agencies couldn't get an accurate assessment on how far Russia would take things to accomplish their goals.

2. There was a high probability at the time that Kyiv would either get encircled or fall. Allies won't deliver their best equipment to the frontlines of an active warzone if the army its supplying is losing. You risk billions in aid getting seized by Russian forces, it would be counter productive to the goal.

3. It was unclear how high the Ukranian army's morale would hold up had Kyiv fallen and Zelensky being assassinated. Morale was high going in, but rapidly losing critical objectives would likely have lead to a real sense of dread and panic amongst ranks. Many in the JFO might have instead chosen to desert and surrender. A disastrous scenario like that means your Billion dollars in aid is actually paying the Russians for a ""job welldone"" rather than arming the Ukranians. 

The shift strategic tact in the types of equipment being sent can be explained by Ukraine's successful repelling of the Russian forces so far.

FFS.  There are rules in war, especially with regards to civilian/military engagement.  Who is more evil here?  One force deliberately places military hardware in civilian areas knowing that they will be targeted.  The other force will try to destroy it.  Now, in the rules of war you explicitly are not supposed to place military hardware in civilian areas.  Guess what?  People like ISIS and Russia do.  Why, because they know that countries like the US actually give a shit about civilian casualties.  Now, the US will still destroy targets like that.  However, they will try to figure out a way to try and limit collateral damage.  Why do you think the US has invested so much in precision weapons and recon?  Because civilian casualties are for one, fucking terrible.  Two, it's a pain in the ass.  There are investigations.  Journalists crawl up you butthole.  Holier than thou keyboard warriors on reddit scream about the evil of the US.  AAAAAAANNNNNDDDD it makes the population hate you and want to fight you more.  In the end killing civilians is COUNTERPRODUCTIVE to American strategy. So American forces will look at a target, choose the most expensive thing tax dollars can buy, figure out a time of day when casualties will be minimized, then blow it up.  Russia?  Fuck that.  Instead of taking out a single school where a SAM system is located their solution is line up the artillery and level the whole goddamn area.  War is terrible.  Innocent people die.  There are two ways to do it, the American/Western way or the Russia/ISIS/if more people die then the less I have to feed way.  Pick one.

6- Calling their enemies weak drug addicts and then getting their asses handed to them.

7- State media journalists calling for war crimes against the Ukrainian civilian population while their government attempts to frame Ukraine for assassination attempts against state media journalists.  This one is less funny, but more of a Leopards-ate-my-face moment.

>Using dynamite to ""blow out"" the fire by forcing the burning fuel and oxygen away from the fuel source. This was one of the earliest effective methods and is still widely used. The first use was by Myron Kinley's father in California in 1913. Generally explosives are placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives are surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material. A horizontal crane is used to bring the drum as close to the wellhead as possible. This method was depicted in the 1968 film Hellfighters starring John Wayne.

 >The Cobasna ammunition depot is a large ammunition depot located in the village of Cobasna. Legally and internationally recognized as part of Moldova as a whole, the unrecognized breakaway state of Transnistria controls the village and the ammunition depot and has denied access to international observers, an exception being the so-called peacekeeping military forces of Russia located in the region ever since the end of the Transnistria War in 1992. Currently, civilian access to the ammunition depot is restricted and only the Russian and Transnistrian authorities have detailed information regarding the amount and situation of the stored weapons.

I don't disagree that there is no way you can get a Ukrainian trained on them to the standards of the US Army or Air Force in hours or days. But unless there are infinite warehouses of T-72s that keep being ""found"" in Eastern Europe, Ukraine must eventually get trained on Western European/US tanks (Leopard 1, Challenger, M1A1).

It was a perfectly reasonable assumption on Feb 25, or maybe even April 2, that Ukraine was either going to fall or the sanctions would make Russia back down before an M1 crew (or F16, etc) crew could be trained, logistics arranged, etc. But here on April 25 we aren't in that place anymore, Russia is gearing up for the long war and so is Ukraine.
