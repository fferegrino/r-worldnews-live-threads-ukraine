1/4 The current situation around Vuhledar is stable. The enemy continues assaults with small infantry groups covered by artillery and indirect tank fire, however without any success. The enemy is hesitant to perform large-scale attacks.

2/4 The enemy hasn't stopped moving additional forces in the Vuhledar area and has concentrated sizeable forces made of mixed units from different brigades and armies.

3/4 At the same time, it's important not to rush to conclusions based on large concentrations, because the quality of reserves is lower than the quality of destroyed units - 155th and 40th brigades.

4/4 While the enemy continues to saturate the area with artillery and infantry, it's unclear whether the enemy is planning to develop another large-scale offensive with lower-quality troops or concentrate more troops to make small, tactical advancements.

>
>KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces attacked dozens of Ukrainian positions across the eastern front, the Ukrainian military said on Monday, as Moscow’s assaults widen and intensify ahead of what Kyiv has warned could be the Kremlin’s largest offensive since the first weeks of the war.
>
>The Ukrainian General Staff, which is responsible for military strategy, said in its daily battlefield update that the Russians fired on some two dozen towns and villages around Bakhmut, the ruined city that has become the focal point of Moscow’s campaign to seize all of the eastern area known as Donbas.
>
>But the general staff said that the chaotic nature of the Russian effort — including waves of inexperienced recruits and former convicts belonging to the Wagner paramilitary group — was limiting its effectiveness.
>
>“There was a complete lack of coordination and interaction among the servicemen of Russian occupation troops and the so-called Wagner Group’s mercenaries,” it said.
>
>Just as Russia used its overwhelming advantage in artillery early in the war to grind out gains in eastern Ukraine, it is now deploying hundreds of thousands of newly mobilized soldiers, in small groups, to probe for vulnerabilities in Ukrainian defensive lines. That has forced Ukraine to stretch its forces to meet the threat.
>
>But while the fighting has been brutal — with hundreds of soldiers being killed or wounded daily on both sides, according to U.S. and European estimates — neither side has achieved any significant territorial gains in months. The eastern front has remained largely the same, running along a 140-mile stretch of territory that forms the shape of a jagged crescent moon.
>
>It remains unclear where and when Moscow will mount a large-scale offensive, but Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said on Sunday that tens of thousands of newly mobilized soldiers have been dispatched to northeastern and southeastern Ukraine. He said that Moscow is determined to break through Ukrainian defensive lines before the anniversary of its invasion, on Feb. 24.

The enemy is preparing to advance. We are preparing to defend ourselves and return our own.”  
>  
>\- **While still defense minister, Reznikov said at a news conference Sunday that Ukraine will receive fighter jets from the West eventually**, but that what kind they’ll be is yet to be decided. He did not specify why he was confident that the aid would arrive. President Biden said last week the United States would not send F-16s to Ukraine, but that comment elicited skepticism from the Pentagon.  
>  
>\- **Reznikov also hinted at his potential resignation at the news conference but said that would be Zelensky’s decision**. “No authority sits in the same chair for their entire life, so you have to be prepared for this fate,” Reznikov said. “As a former lawyer, I’m optimistic that even if I’m not in this role, I’ll have a role that will allow me to punish the Russians.” Zelensky has recently dismissed several top officials in a shake-up; Reznikov has not been implicated in alleged corruption.  
>  
>\- **Crews expect to finish their work by Friday on Odessa’s electrical substation, where an accident this weekend caused a severe fire**, said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the Ukrenergo utility’s chairman. Kudrytskyi blamed the accident on recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian electricity infrastructure but did not specify an exact cause. About 300,000 people had limited electricity Sunday, down from almost 500,000 who lost power initially.

According to the regional governor, those injured were a security guard working at an educational institution, a 54-year-old woman, and three middle-aged men. Oleh Synyehubov said rescue efforts are ongoing. Photos from the scene show residents being evacuated and emergency personnel working amid the rubble. 
>  
>*The battle for Bakhmut*  
>  
>\- **Zelensky said Saturday that the situation was “complicated” in eastern Ukraine, especially around Bakhmut, Vuhledar, and Lyman**. Ukraine has said it will keep fighting for Bakhmut, even as Russia tightens its grip on the city. Ukrainian losses are mounting in Bakhmut, where a U.S. citizen, Pete Reed, was killed this month while working as a volunteer paramedic with an outreach group.  
>  
>\- **Russian forces made small advances toward Bakhmut, and the city “is increasingly isolated,” according to the British Defense Ministry**. Last week, the ministry said that troops from the Wagner mercenary group “highly likely seized” a road connecting Bakhmut with the town of Siversk roughly 23 miles northeast. Now, the two main routes to Bakhmut available to Ukrainian forces are probably “both threatened by direct fire,” it added.  
>  
>\- **The Russian tycoon behind the Wagner Group denied rumors circulating in Russian media that Ukrainian forces are retreating from the area around Bakhmut**. “Ukrainian forces are not retreating anywhere. They are fighting to the last,” Yevgeniy Prigozhin said on Telegram. “Fierce battles are going on in the northern quarters for every street, every house, every stairwell.”

spoke about the situation in **Vuhledar, on Feb 6**:

""The occupiers came to Vugledar from 3 sides—quite stupidly and head-on. [Our] 72nd brigade is stationed in Vugledar itself. They worked very competently. The Russians were encircled, and they have a lot of casualties,"" Nazarenko said.

He added that the Russians also tried to bypass the city, but they were met by [another] separate rifle brigade. The Ukrainian military not only resisted, but also gave a good fight to the occupiers.

According to the press officer of the 68th brigade, the Russians have stopped storming Vugledar today, but the shelling of the city continues.

""The Russians shoot, we shoot. Artillery duels continue, but there are no assaults by the enemy,"" Nazarenko emphasized.

He noted that during the storming of Vugledar, the Russian occupiers used a different approach than during the attacks on Bakhmut.

""If the *Wagner* PMC is operating in Bakhmut, which tosses people on the attack in waves—whoever arrives is sent regardless of who they are—then we didn’t have anything like that,"" Nazarenko noted.

According to him, Vugledar was stormed by *professional* Russian troops, in particular:

- 155 separate brigade of marines, belonging to the Pacific Fleet of Russia;

- 40th Marine Corps Brigade;

- airborne troops.

He also noted that the occupiers acted ‘as written in the Soviet book,’—meaning, they went on the offensive with tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, with the support of artillery and aviation.

""When the Russians realized that the offensive did not succeed, they did not continue to stupidly fight against the wall of the Ukrainian army, like the Wagnerites in Bakhmut. The invaders took a break and are now sitting quietly,"" said Nazarenko.

According to the serviceman, Vugledar suffers from enemy shelling every day.

""The Russian occupiers caused significant destruction to Vuhledar with constant shelling. In fact, the city really no longer exists. The situation there is worse than even in Bakhmut. There is nothing in Vuhledar at all,"" said Nazarenko.

Despite this, civilians remain in the city. According to the press officer of the 68th brigade, there are several hundred people in Vugledar who refuse to leave.

""Perhaps, someone is not able to leave, even though there was an evacuation. But there are people among these people who are not very friendly to Ukraine. They are probably the folks who [believe Russian propaganda],” said Nazarenko.

He added that regardless of the political position of these civilians, by remaining in the city, they unfortunately put themselves in great danger.",1675702068.0,1675700380.0,t3_10ux1pk,t3_10ux1pk,,0,53,0,53,0,0,

Day 347-348 of my updates from Kharkiv.

These past few days have been pretty crazy, with some missile strikes yesterday and the earthquake in Turkey today. Yesterday our day started with missiles first thing in the morning. It was 8:19am when we heard the first explosion, which we thought wasn’t an explosion at first because at that exact same time there was a garbage truck right under our window and it made sounds that very much resembled the explosions. Though just 2 minutes later we heard a second explosion, which made us realize that it was a real missile attack.

Their choice of targets was as unoriginal as ever, they aimed at a university and some apartment blocks in the center of the city. They managed to destroy a part of the university, but thankfully they missed apartment buildings by a hair and hit the street between two rows of buildings. They were without a doubt aiming at the apartment buildings, fucking bastards. Miraculously there wasn’t even a single death and only 5 people total were injured from both of the missiles combined, though all the apartments that were close to the epicenter took damage from the blast wave, not a single window was left intact from what I’ve seen.

Today’s earthquake(s) that happened in Turkey were just horrific. It’s honestly pretty insane seeing that scale of destruction from just a couple of minutes of earthquakes. Entire cities look just like the ones that were destroyed by Russia here in Ukraine, the only difference is that it took Russians months of shelling and missile strikes to make them look like that, and an earthquake did the same (or even a much greater) amount of damage in just a couple of minutes.

We know from other sources that most DNR / LNR separatist regiments have been bled dry. Separatist own sources state that many are down to nothing but command staff. Soviet and now Russian doctrine relies on disposable lower-value troops used as cannon fodder. Russia alternates between press-ganged Ukrainians from occupied territories, prisoners, and non-ethnic mobiks. 

It appears that non-ethnic Russian mobiks from Tuva in East Siberia have been 'gifted' to a DPR unit:

> On the 4th of April DNR militia came over. They shot over our heads with their AKs, forced us to do push-ups, and told them that none of us will leave here alive, that we now belong to DNR""

It's all on video which shows

> several men armed with machine guns throw a kneeling serviceman to the ground and curse him out as they administer a beating.

> The video shows a man who identifies himself as Daddy says ""and this comrade general begged me, because he knows the kind of guy I am, he says, Daddy, when you go over there, don't kill them please. They're all Shoigu's relatives. You'll waste them, and their mommies and daddies will wear themselves out writing complaints to uncle Shoigu.""

Daddy appears to be a Colonel Vyacheslav Gubin, a Ukrainian traitor from Kharkiv who has served his Russian masters since 2014 leading the 1st Slav Brigade of the DNR. Gubin already made headlines for his vivid description of executing Ukrainian POWs and then shooting his own men 'for cowardice' in 2014. 

Now Tuvans are indeed writing letters. Putin-appointed head of the Tuva region is 'preparing a set of detailed questions for the ministry of defense"". There has been no contact from the mobiks since the video.",False,1675704730.0,t3_10ux1pk,t3_10ux1pk,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

75 billion to Ukraine over five years

Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum today presented a large-scale aid package worth tens of billions of kroner to Ukraine.

It includes money for reconstruction and arms aid to Ukraine.

- We propose that NOK 15 billion be allocated to Ukraine every year for five years. It is 75 billion, says Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre (Ap).

- There is a proposal for 50 per cent for the defense in Ukraine, i.e. military aid, and 50 per cent for civilian aid this year, he says.

The Prime Minister confirmed that the crisis aid will involve increased use of oil money in this year's budget.

- We hope to get an agreement in place by 24 February, says Støre.

February 24 marks one year since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the neighboring country.

The parliamentary leaders of the parties in the Storting met this morning to hear about and discuss the multi-year package.

- It is 100 years since Fridtjof Nansen received the peace prize, so we call it the Nansen program for Ukraine.

In addition, an extra NOK 5 billion is set aside for countries affected by the consequences of the war, NOK 2.5 billion for food aid and NOK 2.5 billion for humanitarian aid.

- It is important that the southern part of the world also receives help. We have a clear vested interest in fewer people feeling the need to flee, says Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum (Sp).

The aid package is the result of a budget agreement between the governing parties and SV last autumn.

- Ap, Sp and SV will ask the government to come back to the Storting with a framework and program for how multi-year significant support can be set up and contribute to the reconstruction of Ukraine, the agreement states.

The agreement between the government parties and SV
Support for Ukraine and aid as a result of the war in the Black Sea region

Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine is a crossroads in security policy. Basic international law and the UN Charter are disregarded by force, and the independence and democracy of a neighboring country are challenged with military means. For Norway, this is about fundamental interests. Our first line of defense in foreign and security policy is respect for international law. Russia's attack on Ukraine is therefore a direct threat to our national interests. By ending the international effort to
support Ukraine, we strengthen our own and other European countries' security, while at the same time demonstrating a willingness to act in solidarity and cooperation at a time when Europe is under pressure.

We are in a situation where our petroleum revenues have increased significantly as a direct consequence of Russia's energy war against Europe. Norway is already making a significant effort in Ukraine. The government has increased support in several rounds during 2022. At the same time, there is a need to do more. Norway should avoid
walking alone. We must coordinate support with neighboring countries and multilateral organisations. The international support for Ukraine is becoming better coordinated. Norway actively participates in this work. It is too early to determine the structure and size of the increased support.

The Labor Party, the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party therefore agree that, during the first half of 2023, the Government will put forward proposals for a framework for a larger, multi-year contribution to the reconstruction of and support for Ukraine.

The war in Ukraine has global consequences. Distress and food shortages affect many countries outside the region as a result of the ripple effects of the war.
The one percent target before Norwegian aid is fixed. There is uncertainty related to the overall level of aid for 2023, partly as a result of uncertain estimates for ODA-approved refugee expenditure and what proportion of the support to Ukraine will be ODA-approved.

At the same time, a significant, multi-year program for the reconstruction of and support for Ukraine over time will make a significant contribution to meeting the one percent target for aid.

In connection with the processing of the Ukraine program in the first half of 2023, the parties will also put forward proposals to increase aid and humanitarian aid to mitigate the situation for areas affected by the consequences of the war in the Black Sea region, particularly within the food and energy area.

It is important, also in the current situation of war in Europe, to stick to safe economic management and the guidelines for fiscal policy. The fiscal policy framework has stood the test of time for over 20 years and served us well. We must avoid undermining the credibility of economic policy.

A Norwegian contribution to Ukraine will entail somewhat higher oil money spending. This must be seen together with the extraordinary situation of war in Europe and security policy challenges linked to an aggressive neighboring country. In line with the action rule, account must be taken of effects on the Norwegian economy,
at the same time, the budget policy must be long-term and responsible so that we can withstand a sharp fall in the fund value and that we must have the opportunity to use fiscal policy in the event of a future marked setback in the Norwegian economy. The parties will further propose a significant contribution to aid and
humanitarian aid, particularly in the area of food and energy as a result of the war in the Black Sea region.

The Labor Party, the Center Party and the Socialist Left Party will ask the Government to come back to Parliament with a framework and program for how substantial multi-year support can be set up and contribute to the reconstruction of Ukraine. Proposals for aid and humanitarian aid must also be put forward
particularly in the food and energy area as a result of the war in the Black Sea region. Broad agreement is sought in the Storting and as large a majority as possible for these proposals.
Aiming for 1 percent
SV's aim is that the increased aid should bring Norway up to the target of 1 per cent in aid of the gross national income (GNI).

Norway has made a lot of money as a result of the war, primarily because it has driven up the price of oil and gas.

The government wants a broad settlement in the Storting, in order to ensure predictability and the long-term nature of Norwegian aid.

However, there are positive signals coming from Conservative Party leader Erna Solberg.

- This is in line with what we have discussed since the beginning of December. It's nice to know what the government has in mind, she says to NRK.

Solberg hopes for a political agreement before 24 February. Like Støre, she is open to using more oil money to help Ukraine.

- Yes, we can, she says.

Liberal leader Guri Melby says she considers the 75 billion as ""a floor and not a ceiling"" for Norwegian support.

- We want to keep an opening to be able to put in more and signaled in the meeting that the package could have been bigger, especially in light of the extraordinary income Norway has as a result of the war.

And it is unclear how many parties will support the package.

Red is basically against giving money for weapons in Ukraine. Rødt leader Bjørnar Moxnes attended Monday's meeting in the cabinet hall at the Storting, but was not available in Vandrehallen afterwards.

At the same time, the Progress Party is critical of billions of dollars being spent on aid to countries other than Ukraine, including in Africa.

- We are positive about assisting Ukraine both militarily and humanitarianly, says Frp's fiscal policy spokesperson Hans Andreas Limi.

- But we are skeptical that an increase in the ordinary aid budget is linked with aid to Ukraine, he adds.",1675724115.0,1675723925.0,t3_10ux1pk,t1_j7fax5s,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

No, instead the rocket flare fills in the space behind the round so that instead of a turbulence-inducing flat back it has a gentle taper, as this photo so nicely demonstrates.

I‘m honest: I expected a Winter push by Ukraine, instead we got Russian zerg rushes. I like the idea of letting the Russians bleed themselves out in an ill-conceived and largely politically / PR motivated offensive campaign, and after that regain the initiative.

I really hope Ukraine did manage the battle of Bakhmut in the way Kofman indicates, which means holding back and not letting their best troops get attrited.

Also his account seems in line with earlier reports about the US advising Ukraine to hold back with offensive action in order to let the new equipment settle in.

The crash in the late 90s was quicker to recover for Russian business because it was largely insulated by foreign currency holdings and some other mitigating factors.

That said: The 99% in Russia lost much of their savings back then.

Now? Putin and his goons have artificially buoyed the ruble through a variety of means that have absolutely removed those factors that saved Russian business back in the 90s.

Couple that with asset seizure of foreign businesses, clamping down on the Russian markets, and so many other piss poor decisions -- Russia is indeed proper fucked. The Big Collapse is looming.

The 99% will lose out the most, yet again, and will blame anyone but the people responsible.

That's not necessarily true at all. The US announced Ukraine would be receiving HIMARS at the start of June and said they were delivered at the end of June. It later came out that Ukraine was using them at least two weeks *before they said they were delievered.* You don't always announce something that gives you a new capability ahead of time because you don't want to give your enemy time to change how they operate. The same thing happened with M113 armored personal carriers, not exactly a huge new capability but allies announced they were delivering them and then there was a video from Ukraine showing them training with them I think a week at most after. And you can bet the decision to send both was actually made months before that and training started well in advance of it being announced publicly. And the HARM anti radiation missiles to take out Russian anti aircraft radars weren't announced at all, the US only admitted it had given them to Ukraine *after* Russia found pieces of the missiles after a strike.

Notice how there is a will we/won't we debate dragged out for months before every major weapon system delivery? Especially for those that seem like an escalation like HIMARS or western tanks? There was a time Bradley's weren't even being considered just a couple months ago... they had probably already decided to send them before they started saying that. 

Russia is not the only one playing the information game. Whatever we see in public about weapon systems for Ukraine is for PR purposes, it's a performance piece, no one ever called an accidental press conference. The endless discussion about it is designed to undermine Russian talk of escalation by making sure by the time a formal announcement is made it doesn't make as much of a splash because there have already been 10 weeks of articles about even *if* it was going to happen.

We're going to find out after the war that Ukrainian's were being trained on some of these systems months before anything was announced. I can guarantee that Ukrainian soldiers have been training on Leopard 2's and Bradley's for months now, probably in Germany or Poland. There were videos of Bradley's being shipped through Romania and Poland *days* after it was announced. Sure they could be movements for NATO forward presence in eastern European countries but most likely they are already in Ukraine as we speak.

>The longer Crimea stays in Russian hands, the harder returning it will be.

It's been a very pro-Russian territory for decades, and Russia has already had 8 years of control in Crimea to prepare for this war.  More time won't really change anything.

But also I don't think you're thinking of the end-game of the war correctly.  Basically, your post is suggesting that if Ukraine can't directly assault and capture the territory, they won't get it.  I think that's basically the best case scenario for Russia -- that their military and economic and political organization can hold it together long enough to get a peace treaty respecting the territory they physically hold.  

I would not bet on Russia holding that all together.  The endgame that Ukraine is looking for is like Vietnam or Afghanistan (all Afghanistan wars) or the de-occupation of eastern Europe at the end of the USSR -- where military, political, or economic insufficiencies make it impossible for Russia to continue the occupation.

I guess it's just when you spend your whole life looking at the world through a particular lens, you just grow blind to other angles.

SentientHotdogWater, a whiny far-leftist, complains that non-far leftists are accusing the far-left of being pro-Russia.

MKCAMK, a hero of justice, links two videos of two far-left shows, where the far-left hosts use far-left argumentation for why the USA and NATO should be opposed in Ukraine.

SentientHotdogWater, being cornered by the hero of justice, tries to wiggle themself out, by noting that just because some people on the **right** believe a **far-right** conspiracy theory, it does not mean that it is the consensus among the **right**.

This makes no sense, because that specific conspiracy theory comes from someone on the **far-right**, not **right**, and conspiracy theories are in fact currently the norm on the **far-right**, so it actually is representative. SentientHotdogWater tried to muddy the waters by moving the topic from extreme to mainstream political views, but was stopped by MKCAMK (so handsome!)

Originally, SentientHotdogWater was protesting about the fact that non-far-leftist were not providing evidence for the claim that the far-left supports Russia. MKCAMK, a non-far-leftist, and an overall great guy, bravely provided proof of self-described far-leftist giving far-leftist argumentation for just that. Cowardly, SentientHotdogWater retreated into their hole, crying :""B-b-but... it is not the consensus! It does not count!""
