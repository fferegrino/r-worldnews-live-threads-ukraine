Day 252 of my updates from Kharkiv.

We had a couple of missile strikes here today. First one was at 7:20am, with 2 missiles coming from Belgorod, but those weren’t aimed at our city. They landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast, but we don’t know what was hit by them; there was no further info about it.

Then most of the rest of the day was pretty quiet until 11pm, when 3 missiles were fired from Belgorod again, and this time they did land in Kharkiv. Because the air raid alert was already active for almost 3 hours prior, there was no additional warning about incoming missiles, so we didn’t know about them until they landed here, which was pretty loud. Apparently some administrative building was hit, there is no info about anyone getting injured from the explosions, and hopefully it stays that way.

And what was that about Russia returning to the grain deal after we apparently guaranteed the safety of their Black Sea fleet? This whole situation just seems bizarre. So they invaded us, destroyed our cities, killed our people and now we are the guarantors of their safety? What the hell? I’m not even sure if that whole thing about us giving them written agreement to not use the grain corridor to attack their fleet is real, but that’s what Russia is saying. The fact that Russia needs us to guarantee their safety is so fucking funny.

A few were captured. A few became traitors.  Most were able to escape, regroup in Mykolaiv, and are today stationed in Kharkiv border area.

The commander, though, dressed himself like a homeless man, walked around like a drunkard, laid in ditches.  Why?  To observe, report RF movements, equipment coordinates. [ie, “they’re back at Chornobaivka.  No seriously.  Yes, you hit it.  It’s just that they’ve returned. Yes, again.”]  

He himself had to try several times in order to get out of the region.  Once taken to the basements, but Russians didn’t realize who he is and were too chaotic and let him go.  Later, got lucky again—the Dagestani units were manning checkpoints and thought he looked old AF, mockingly calling him grandpa and hardly even checking him to see if he was anyone important.

He’s back commanding his unit, wants to return to Kherson. [ie, “we know where the buried weapons are.”]

Called it! How satisfying! 

So Russia, petulant child, has now determined that Ukraine’s promise to not use the shipping corridor to attack the Russian fleet is good enough for them, and will rejoin the grain deal. 

The thing is, Russia never joined in the deal with any sort of good faith — when they realized blackmailing the world was good and all, but that there was no way they could blame things on Ukraine, a country without a navy, should anything go wrong, then there was more advantage to them to go for the deal than refuse. That’s it: realpolitik with a criminal garnish, same as it ever was. 

So when they were attacked, they used it as a pretense to nix the deal, and blame Ukraine. Sounds on point for them. 

But that just puts them back exactly where they were, with less leverage. No grain deal, nothing they can threaten to pull out of. And they look bad again using starvation as a weapon. 

Apparently even though we all know they would use that weapon, being publicly blamed for it is too far for them. 

So they have no choice but to rejoin the compact, using another flimsy excuse that has always been the deal anyway. 

And the best part is Russia’s bluff has now been called and their leverage from threatening to pull out again is considerably weakened.

>  
Nuclear fuel rods from Tomsk: Europe's incredible dependence on Russia  
Despite Putin's war, France remains undeterred in its close cooperation with Rosatom. For the first time, the German Environment Ministry is calling for sanctions. This turnaround is overdue.  
Nuclear power appears to some as an alternative to Russian gas. But electricity from nuclear power is leading Europe from the frying pan into the fire. According to a study by the Austrian Federal Environment Agency, ""the use of nuclear power in no way increases security of supply, but has made the operating states dependent on Russia.""  
There is, however, one major difference from other energies: the nuclear sector is exempt from all EU sanctions, ""at French instigation,"" according to the German government.  
All roads lead to Moscow when it comes to operating and building new nuclear power plants. Rosatom and its 300 subsidiaries operate and build more nuclear power plants (NPPs) worldwide than any other state.  
According to the Vienna study, ""Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic are 100 percent dependent on Russian uranium"" in the EU, and the EU as a whole is 20 percent dependent - which is more than Russia's share of gas supply. About half of the uranium enriched by Rosatom ends up in EU countries and the UK.  
The company owes its success to skillful international alliances, especially with France. Rosatom has signed countless agreements in recent years with state-owned utility EDF, fuel supplier Orano and plant manufacturer Framatom, which also carries France's nuclear armaments.  
One of the managing directors of Rosatom Western Europe even studied at the elite Ecole Polytechnique, which belongs to the French military.  
The close cooperation results in a dependency that is fourfold: First, France purchases enriched uranium from Russia, often through Framatom's subsidiary ANF in Lingen, northern Germany. Between March 2020 and September 2022 alone, 26 shipments of uranium pellets and the precursor uranium hexafluoride arrived there.  
Second, France exports spent uranium from its nuclear power plants to Russia, partly via Lingen. It is re-enriched in Tomsk, Russia, because Orano does not have such a plant itself. The fresh fuel is used in EDF's most powerful reactors, which are being modernized.  
""The contracts usually stipulate that the part that is no longer to be used, most of it in terms of quantity, will remain in Russia,"" says an expert on the matter. Separated is also weapons-grade plutonium.  
The EU bans the export of nuclear waste, but depleted uranium is considered a recyclable material: a clever workaround that relieves France's bursting-at-the-seams interim storage facilities. Orano has built facilities for conditioning depleted uranium in Russia.  
The third form of dependence: Rosatom takes Framatom, EDF or even Schneider Electric with it when it builds new nuclear plants abroad. The French can then supply turbines, control technology or safety equipment. For reactors under construction in Hungary and Egypt, Framatom and Siemens contribute the control technology.  
""French companies participate in the construction of Russian reactors and earn good money from it,"" observes Roger Spautz of Greenpeace France. France shows its gratitude: in 2018, Rosatom and Framatom agreed that the French would help a Rosatom subsidiary obtain EU certifications.  
A fourth dependency is emerging: last year, Air Liquide and EDF agreed with Rosatom to produce ""green"" hydrogen, in France, Russia and elsewhere. EDF told Handelsblatt it was temporarily suspending the agreement.  
The Russian energy strategy is clever  
Cleverly, then, the Russians are occupying another key sector for Europe's energy supply. With the construction of magnets for wind turbines, a rare component, they have another ace up their sleeve.  
Framatom refused to comment on its collaborations with Rosatom despite repeated requests. Rosatom's German subsidiary Nukem, which has 125 employees, is different. Its managing director Thomas Seipolt told Handelsblatt: ""Since the start of the Ukraine war, only a vanishingly small number of orders have been canceled.""  
To cement cooperation with the Russians, Framatom even wanted to sell them a stake in its German plant in Lingen. The German government informally made it clear that it did not think this was a good idea. Officially, however, the application is still pending.  
Rosatom is also involved in Russia's nuclear arms race and Putin's predatory war in Ukraine, where Russian personnel occupy the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. President Emmanuel Macron, whose rhetoric calls for more EU sovereignty, nevertheless maintains the pact with Rosatom.  
The German government, on the other hand, is meanwhile keeping its distance: the German Environment Ministry told Handelsblatt that it is in favor of ""extending the EU sanctions measures to Russia's nuclear industry. This will have to be coordinated with European partners."" That would be an overdue political turnaround.

I am kind of worried about these gas hubs and I really hope western leaders will not back down and shamelessly try to sell ""we're buying gas from Turkey, not from Russia!"".",False,1667429418.0,t3_yjuves,t3_yjuves,,0,-2,0,-2,0,0,

That looks like some sort of charge launched in a line, designed to detonate any mines/etc that are within the blast radius.

Explosives need explosives to go off, modern explosives if burned will generally just burn. So by sending a shockwave or bang around an explosive weapon, it detonates.

So it looks like it would create a lane that is 'cleared' and my guess is that it would have caveats as to what depth, most demining does. I'm speculating but it may not be great against 'buried' charges awaiting the setup of an initiating mechanism.

Afghanistan saw a lot of this, buried explosives/shells/etc stashed for another day, where the initiating 'smaller' mechanism could be placed at at later date.

“Russian schoolteachers, for the most part, are fellow prison guards and cops. Workers of the repressive apparatus.

Their job is to cripple the child, to level him, to nail him to the anti-human state standard. Russian schoolteachers are the beacons of conformism, changing political religion in sync with the state apparatus. Many of them, during their careers, have alternately indoctrinated generations in their charge with Grandpa Lenin’s fairy tales, Yeltsin’s “democratic” narrative, and Putin’s “patriotic” hysteria. Being venal conformists themselves, they act as ardent commissars to the children: shouting, preaching, and showering tons of ideological hell on the heads of schoolchildren. We’ve heard these voices of political commissars in dozens of audio recordings made by partisan children in times of protest rallies.

Most of the crimes in the election commissions (located mostly in schools) are on the powerful shoulders of teachers and headmistresses. Crimes against the people, democracy, the foundations of the constitutional order. They help to illegally, by deception, retain state power. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the teacher from the election commission and the cop with a baton stand deeper than the foundation of this unjust state—they hold the foundation on themselves, they prop it up.

Priestesses of deceit and conformity are trusted to teach children. That’s where the real abuse of minors is.”",1667388456.0,1667384125.0,t3_yjuves,t1_iuqkpa7,,1,17,0,17,0,0,

I'm guessing that some Russian charge occurred. The more rudimentary M777 guns + automatic-grenade launchers + machine gun defenses kill people much much faster if they're stupid enough to charge (and the Russians are stupid enough to charge the positions).

Ehhhh, it's important to remember that the head of that column did reach the outskirts of Kyiv, there was savage fighting in several locations where heavy contact was made with large groups of Russian forces. They ran out fuel and supplies *because* Ukraine held the line. Then once stalled out Ukraine was able to hit the Russians behind the lines on their axis of advance which made their position untenable.

More fuel and supplies might not have changed the outcome. Russia did not secure their flanks, did not have proper air defense cover letting Bayraktar's run amok, and Ukranian hit and run teams caused havok. More fuel and supplies might have led to Russia taking Kyiv but it also might have just led to it taking longer for them to realize their position was untenable. More fuel and supplies would not change the fact that they were over extended with unsecured flanks and poor air defenses.

Yes *maybe* Russia would have taken Kyiv with better logistics  but they ran out of fuel because Ukraine stopped them, not because the column never got there.

 >The just war theory (Latin: bellum iustum) is a doctrine, also referred to as a tradition, of military ethics which is studied by military leaders, theologians, ethicists and policy makers. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure that a war is morally justifiable through a series of criteria, all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. The criteria are split into two groups: jus ad bellum (""right to go to war"") and jus in bello (""right conduct in war""). The first group of criteria concerns the morality of going to war, and the second group of criteria concerns the moral conduct within war.

I can't imagine refusing to use a munition because of dud possibility when this will already be an issue. I also don't see farmers being able to return there any time soon in a frozen conflict. 
That being said we could let ukraine decide if they can use them. If they don't want them im not trying to force it on them. But if its a free delivery of weapons will they take them and find a way to utilize them? I think they would... and it may even save the u.s. money to avoid disassembly. 

>Not really correct. HIMARS would not be able to shoot M26s further than self propelled 155mm howitzers can shoot. The MLRS system carried them and would drive up to the frontline with the armored tank units. HIMARS has no armor.

I'm not suggesting ER-MLRS have atacms range. I'm suggesting that both sides have decreasing long range fire capabilities due to attrition. In some situations an ER-MLRS with a range of 45kms could pressure Russian front lines.",1667407209.0,1667406555.0,t3_yjuves,t1_iurr03d,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The normal light water reactors produce plutonium.  Some of that is burned shortly after it is created.  The rods become ""spent"" because the created fuel is less than the consumed fuel.  The rods also become spent because of accumulated poison isotopes.  You can still chemically separate a lot of plutonium from the left over uranium and daughter elements.  

The Mox rod does not work in light water if you reprocess it a second time.  USA does not reprocess nuclear fuel at all.  We have ovr 600 tons of plutonium (in more like 80 thousand tons high level waste).  

USA, UK, and France have huge stockpiles of highly enriched uranium which can be blended in to make regular grade fuel rods.

I think this is the crux.  We are talking about letting Ukrainian civilians die for decades.  There needs to be a much better reason they cannot have the effective weapons that are non-heinous.  It is worse when the civilians die because we pulled garbage out of our landfill.  

We have vast fields of A10s and F16s that are also going to be recycled.  They are not inherently evil anymore than any other weapon.  There is ""a training hold up"".

What? Every country outside western supplied ones have far worse unexploded ordinance rates. The only way you can avoid duds is to either surrender or spend alot of money. The u.s. military wants to have less than a 1% unexploded ordinance rate. It has the money to try and get there. Its estimated that the m26 had around a 5% unexploded ordinance rate for the submunitions. Maybe as high as 10% if you are being conservative. The low end for ukranian and Russian unexploded ordinance is 10% and it goes up to 30% depending on age.  If russia is using North Korean ammunition its 25% based on reviews of some of their barrages in 2013. 

If UXOs make a country evil then you have to believe ukraine must stop shooting everything other than western equipment. Which means they lose. And every other country in the world can't defend themselves from tyrants. 

Or is cluster munitions the thing you find evil? The u.s. using cluster munitions wasnt the evil action. The u.s. using cluster munitions on residential neighborhoods in Yugoslavia was the evil action. The massive civilian casualties is what changed the policy. Russia is doing what the u.s. did 30 years ago. There can't be use of non-guided weapons by Ukraine on occupied non evacuated residental areas especially not cluster munitions. All u.s. support should end if that is regularly happening(not a mistake like rocket shot down on way to target). 

> Are the Ukrainians human beings who are like normal human beings in most other cultures? ""Here i give you this option with short term benefits but there are heinous long term consequences"". Not likely that scared people will think things through. Matters get worse when opposition parties have been disbanded and the country is under martial law. We (USA) have numerous other options. Look at the weapons types that we give to Israel and Saudi Arabia 

Yes. We do have the capability to provide better.  We just have to be willing to pony up the value. F-16s are not being mothballed yet. It would probably be something like 200m an f-16 including support, ammunition, fuel,  etc for a year. Given that the numbers floating around for Ukraine aid is something like 60B from the u.s. if ukraine could spend that all on f-16s and a-10s(which won't happen)  it won't have enough to end the war. Now I'm more than happy to spend more but most Americans don't seem willing too. I'd love for Ukraine to gain air superiority and then mop up Russians with it. 

But this is the issue ukraine doesn't have a choice between being the u.s. military or using less effective munitions with slightly higher UXOs. If those were the two choices you'd pick being the u.s. military every time. It has alot of options with limited resources to act upon them. Ukraine would be ecstatic to get newer apcs then those designed in 1960 but those 1960 apcs are a hell of alot better than a van. God i see videos with  8 ukranian heroes riding around in a van taken out by a simple Wagner ak-47. Ukraine needs a combination of advanced tech and adequate tech which reduces the death of their soilders and stops attacks on their civilians. If we won't give sufficient quantities of atacms, a-10s, or predator drones because of cost.   then a bunch of cluster munitions, with lowers rates of UXOs then their russian munitions isn't a bad option. Cleaning up the uxos after the war is a better option then being ethnically cleansed. Being shot in the back of the head and buried in a hole. 




>I think this is the crux. We are talking about letting Ukrainian civilians die for decades. There needs to be a much better reason they cannot have the effective weapons that are non-heinous. It is worse when the civilians die because we pulled garbage out of our landfill. 

You are approaching this as if those fields are not already absolutely filled with duds. Some parts of this conflict could have had 10 thousand UXOs a day landing into those fields. You shouldn't have any farmer going into those fields after the war without erw removal. And that erw removal will take a decade regardless. The choice isn't between no uxos and uxos. Its not even less uxos or more. There are demining machines which will more easily handle a bomblet over an anti tank mine. 

>We have vast fields of A10s and F16s that are also going to be recycled. They are not inherently evil anymore than any other weapon. There is ""a training hold up"". This is a concern that poorly trained pilots in poorly maintained planes will get shot down or crash. But if valuing human life is the motivator then farmers and children getting blown up for decades is something to worry about. At least the pilots are volunteer soldiers. Some people think the hold up on M1 Abrams and F-15 is the escalation risk. Resorting to delivering weapons that we deemed too evil for use is a rather high escalation risk. 

Kinda already addressed this 90% of it is refusal due to money. I'd love for them to open our tank stockpiles.  I somehow doubt they'll even give old obsolete tanks which are little better than death traps in our eyes but would save alot of ukranian lives. I hope I'm wrong. 

>We could let Ukraine go tit for tat with Tomahawks. Eye for eye playground for playground. Lets not do that. The Kremlin is the legitimate target in Moscow. Scorched earth tactics inside Ukraine increases the pain caused by the war. It gives Russia more propaganda.

I have obviously never suggested this in our conversation. I would not support attacks on civilians. Although I feel the need to point out a Tomahawk(CEP 5 meters) on a purely military target isn't a ""tit for tat"" compared to what russia is doing. The main issue with civilian casualties/war crimes from russia is:

1. Cluster munitions on residential areas.

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,yjuves,iuttd9a,"Wow.  Good discussion...

I take issue with the decision making process.  We decided to destroy a weapons system and the reason given was that they were evil devices.  Whether or not that is true should be decided and then the decision needs to be final.  Giving the evil to other people is the wrong thing to do.  

I forgot we used them on Serbia.  Kuwait was in my mind.  

The 1% standard and the 5% results sounds familiar.  However, it is not 5% of M26 it was 5% of DCIM.  Each time a missile fires there is a 3200% dud rate.  That is much worse than 25% dud rates.  For cleanup crews the bomblets are very nearly the same difficulty as a larger dud.  For a farmer on a tractor the smaller shell should be a little less dangerous especially with armored tractors.  It remains unreasonable to ask people to plow fields that have explosives detonating.  

The goal for USA is for Ukraine to win the war.  (or is it?)  The way Ukraine can lose is if Ukrainian people lose the will to continue the war.  Use of evil weapons is just bad strategy.  If it renders the land uninhabitable the people who live there will want it to stop.  

>...I have obviously never suggested this in our conversation...

Right you did not.  Nor did I say that you said that.  You did, however, suggest using M26 missiles.  I am saying there is a broad category of things called ""evil shit that we should not do"". * I* can make long lists of disturbing things that are also in that category.  

We can make lists of more reasonable alternatives.   Like [a graphite bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_bomb) for instance.  

There are plenty of more reasonable violent options too.  A ratan stick is always non-lethal.  Several groups have compiled lists of corporations that are still doing business in Russia.  Use the ""rule of thumb"": if the bamboo stick is not thicker than your thumb you can break it on someone's backside without doing long term damage.  Personally I would rather see the government confiscate their shares.  Some details are negotiable.  Once ""doing evil shit"" is an option on the table we can really leverage Wall Street.  I say do that instead of killing Ukrainian farmers.  

After Ukraine not losing the will, the next important component is that Russia must lose the will to continue the war.  What prevents a steady increase in M31 production?  Lockheed was producing 9000 per year while there was no war.  Why not increase that to 90,000 per year?  If Lockheed really cannot adjust production in response to events then maybe we should search for contractors who do have that capability.  Burning through an old stockpile is less demoralizing for Russia than a steady increase.  Russians are acclimated to disasters that they survive.  A situation that is deteriorating is far more frightening.  

I do not think Putin cares how many soldiers die or how much damage Ukraine suffers.  However, he has to care if Russians decide that they are obviously eventually going to lose the war.",False,1667432116.0,t3_yjuves,t1_iutatrl,,7,2,0,2,0,0,
