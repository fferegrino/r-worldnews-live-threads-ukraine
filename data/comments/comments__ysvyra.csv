* Not all of the area around Kherson has been cleared (just too much area to clear in 1 day)
* Antonov bridge destruction: a hit from Ukrainian HIMARS, looks like a truck with weapons/ammo exploded, or the explosives planted in the bridge set up for when the Russians fully cross the bridge were detonated.
* Many of the RUS forces set to defend Kherson fled by foot over the nearby dam.
* RUS forces that could, fled with whatever boats they could find across the river
* Lots of trophies (weapons, ammo) and POW expected due to fuckups on RUS logistics/organization
* about 20k RUS soldiers on Tuesday were in Kherson area, but expected about 18k made it across the River by Friday
* intelligence was hard to gather as most of the RUS departure was at night. Also was a curfew in place around Kherson (threat of being shot on sight if seen in streets), due to bad weather drones were hard to use / weren't used
* Between Kherson and entry into Crimea the HIMARS can reach a lot of the airfields of RUS
* No pause will happen for regrouping, wont allow RUS forces a break
* Diplomatic rumors that Iran no longer wants to give RUS anymore rockets
* Zaporizhia Oblast is very different to Kherson Oblast: its very wide flat and easily traversable ground. RUS forces gathered there because they understand that things can change very quickly
* Winter warfare: winter wont change anything, but might even increase warfare. Only thing that would be a problem is rain and wet conditions. If no rain and just dry winter weather, then its even better than now. Will it be cold in dugouts? No, in the field you will be very warm and well prepared with gear (Aristovich personal experience)
* Everything is falling apart on the RUS side so quickly that timelines to recapture territory might be even faster than expected.

 **“The liberation of the Right Bank has given tremendous hope to the residents still in the Left Bank”**

*How know what’s happening on Left Bank*

- Maintains contacts with numerous residents, both sides of Dneiper.^1  Contacts via whatsapp, UA number, RF carriers.


*How many collaborators versus loyalists*

- out of the small city of 65,000 residents, 12-15,000 remain.  

- 700-800 *known* pro-Russia residents have left for Russia or Crimea^2. But others left for Russia, then pass on to Georgia, Europe.

- We have one department of 250 employees, 50 are known to have switched to other side. 

*Will Russians entrench or retreat:  mixed intel*

- Stole all ambulances and firetrucks, toted off.  Also millions in cognac, art, and electronics.

- But, sent all the Russia-philes out last few weeks, moved into their homes, while also heavily fortifying embankment, digging trenches, etc—suspects they want to winter there

*Are people who took Russian money collaborators?*

- at a point, pensioners *had* to take Russian money to survive, bc access to Ukrainian pensions ceased [implying, ‘it depends’]

*About mysterious death of Stemousov—ie, was it an accident (aka, the hand of God)*

- “If God removed him from this life, then God himself settled the matter; if the patriots removed, then, apparently, everyone is tired of listening to that nonsense.  However, don’t discount that his owners [the Russians] made such a decision.   All these collaborators will later be looked for in ditches, landings, car accidents [killed off by FSB].  Collaboration is a resource that gets used up and thrown away. The same thing would happened in Donetsk, at one time.”

*About a liberation of Nova Kakhovka*

- **“Everyone wants it to happen as quickly as it did with the right bank.”**

- But Nova Kakhovka has three economic structures that are important for the whole of Ukraine—the Kakhovka HPP, the North Crimean Canal, and a powerful substation (hydraulic). 

- Russia uses these to blackmail Ukraine.  It’s connected to the nuclear energy plant, for cooling. But it also ties us to the enemy.  

- **“However, are not going to push the Armed Forces; they themselves know what to do.”**

> On November 11, early a.m., the resistance forces  ""demotivated"" (as Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov put it) collaborator Andrei Boyk.

> For 9 months of occupation, this traitor—the former director of sports school No. 1—achieved the task of placing all members of his family in leadership positions.

> Andrei Boyk, in order to curry favor with the occupier, personally ‘denazified’ city libraries—seizing Ukrainian history books, books about ATO veterans, and even children's literature in Ukrainian. But for all these ""merits"" Andrei Boyk was simply awarded the small post of the Deputy Minister of Sports of the Zaporozhye region by the occupying authorities. Naturally, Boyk hoped to sit in the chair of a regional Minister.  But he was not so lucky. The ministerial portfolio was given to the husband/ part-time personal driver of collaborator Yelena Shapurova, powerlifter Roman Dzyuba. 

> However, yesterday marked the beginning of a black mark in the life of rising-careerist collaborator Boyk. When leaving his premises, **an explosive device planted in a storm drain pipe** exploded. As a result, the collaborator was urgently hospitalized. The traitor is alive, but he is contused. And, very frightened.  Without security/protection, he is now afraid to move around his own apartment, much less, afraid to  get around the city. 

> Melitopol mayor Ivan Fedorov commented on the explosion of the collaborator as follows:

> > The resistance forces worked on a propagandist who was engaged in terror towards our children. He was responsible Russian propaganda being issued to them. He was an unremarkable director of one of the sports schools, who from the first days decided to collaborate and he was punished for this. An explosion went off at the entrance [of his property].

Day 262 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet until just recently, when at 10:20pm an air raid alert started and explosions were heard almost immediately, I’m not sure what it was, but probably missiles, they landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. Judging by the sound we would guess that it fell somewhere in Derhachi.

Yesterday in Kharkiv 2 children were injured in Northern Saltivka district because an unexploded cluster munition that was lying in some bush exploded while they were walking by. Thankfully they survived, but they suffered shrapnel wounds on their legs. It will be extremely dangerous to go anywhere near any kind of bushes/grass in our city for the foreseeable future; some bomb might always be nearby without you even knowing about it.

Today Russians also fired an Iskander with cluster munitions at Zaporizhzhia. I’m not sure if it was intercepted or just malfunctioned, but unexploded cluster munitions fell in the middle of 6 apartment buildings, apparently people need to be evacuated to disarm/destroy the explosives. 

It’s pretty weird that they haven’t done any new massive missile strikes in so long, they are definitely preparing another one, but we don’t know when they will do it, some people are predicting that it will happen on 15th or 16th. Hopefully we will be better prepared for the next one, considering that our new NASAMS finally arrived.

*Vyacheslav lived in Mariupol his entire life, was the “leading automation engineer” at Azovstal, where worked for 30 years.^1 After 2013, he realized that most of his colleagues were pro-Russia.^2 He joined territorial defense, stationed at Azovstal, his job was to retrieve the wounded and carry them to the on-site hospital.*


*Azovstal, Feb - May*
> “Every day, I saw how our surgeon made an extremely difficult choice—who to save first. What to do when there’s nothing to operate on: let the person die in agony, or give something so that the warrior falls asleep and does not wake up. It was frightening!

> You see, many limbs could have been saved if there were more doctors, if had been supplies. The surgeon faced such a dilemma: either to save/prolong one person’s life, or to save another person’s health. The surgeon chose to save life, leaving others unattended, which is why there are so many amputations. Such are the realities of war.”

*Before Capture*

> “At the beginning of May, it was absolutely clear: we had only a few days left to live.  Every time I got a little sleep, I fell asleep thinking that I might not have a tomorrow. Therefore, when the supervisor came to the hospital and said that we were leaving, many people actually breathed a sigh of relief.  It was obvious that it will not be easy in captivity, but still, the chances of survival are much higher.”


*Russians sadistically made the POWs Run the gamut—literally*

> “All the POWs transferred from Olenivtsi were blindfolded, handcuffed and were left like that. That's how—completely blind, completely helpless—they began to push everyone down the corridor, with Russians along the sides beating them, from all sides.

> We were brutalized, and when someone fell, they were beaten even harder. I was walking and did not understand from which side to expect another blow. I broke three ribs. When we were separated into cells, I complained that my ribs were broken and that I could not breathe because of this. They did an X-ray and saw, indeed, three ribs were broken during that gamet run. After that, they did not beat me hard on the body. I think it saved me. Because everyone else was brutally beaten twice a day.

> We could not trust medical help. The doctor himself was a sadist. Sometimes he simply entered a cell with a guard and began to beat the POWs.”


The terrorists simultaneously forced the men to recite the words to a deranged poem:

> > *Forgive us, fellow Russians...*

> > *We will not stop being your brothers...*

> “They forced me to learn all ten verses of the rhyming delusion and recite it all.”

He was exchanged in October, because he is of “pensioner” age. He is in a rehabilitation center.

> He has no idea what to do next. He says that if the commission finds him healthy, he will continue to fight, but if not... “let's not look too far ahead. We will wait for victory!”

Army needs cheap weapons that can be produced quickly in large numbers. Like Iran or China. How to turn war in favor of Russia, probably with help of these two countries.With change of political views on current situation.

Similar info comes from GreyZone (which usually is pro RU)

>According to satellite images, the Russian army has begun withdrawing key units from the outskirts of the village of Chaplynka on the left bank of the Dnieper River in the Kherson region.

>These measures are forced due to the abandonment of the right-bank part of the Kherson region, as the Ukrainian army's HIMARS and M270 missile launchers stationed along the Dnieper will now be able to strike at this base.

>Chaplynka was occupied by the Russian Armed Forces on February 24, where a permanent base and a helicopter airfield were set up at the abandoned airfield, from where Ka-52 strike aircraft were constantly flown to support Russian units defending the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Also, judging by Western satellite images, a high-level headquarters was located there.

>However, the headquarters and a significant part of the equipment have now left the Chaplynka airfield and have been moved to another location, out of reach of possible Ukrainian strikes. Some of the helicopters still remain on the runway to support and cover the withdrawal of the right-bank grouping, but there is no doubt that they will also leave Chaplynka following the others in the future. Leaving this helicopter airfield will greatly affect the quality and efficiency of air support for the Russian Armed Forces in Zaporizhzhya and the Kherson region. And most importantly, Chaplynka will not be the only one. Beyond the ~90 km kill radius of GMLRS missiles, all critical positions, units and equipment will now have to be withdrawn.

In the other chamber the House of Representatives it is more likely than not that the Republicans will gain power, and Leader Kevin McCarthy has said he doesn't want the US to give a ""blank check"" for Ukraine. That said, if they do manage to get the House (it's not 100% yet) the Republicans' margin will be VERY slim, on the order of two or so votes. Given that a plurality of GOP members support Ukraine and the Democrats will essentially all vote for aid, the ability for McCarthy to kneecap Ukrainian funding even if he wanted to is basically nil.

One possibility I haven’t seen mentioned is this: Ukraine could temporarily go on the defensive for awhile. Why would they do that, when they have the initiative? 

A couple of reasons may be suggested. 

First, the new Russian general in charge will be under lots of pressure to deliver quick results. Giving up Kherson was absolutely the correct military move, but it came at an *enormous* political cost in lost Russian prestige - Russian cope-ers may go on about how it was wise (and in fact it was, Kherson was a trap for the Russian forces once their offensive ran out of steam), but a withdrawal is a withdrawal, and losing Kherson was a big humiliation. Putin seems to have allowed it in order to give his new general a clean military slate, to carry out new plans - but if so, he’s going to demand results, and soon. 

This puts the Russians in an awkward position. Merely defending isn’t going to regain them lost prestige. So they must attack. But their forces aren’t in good shape. Plus, winter is coming, and they aren’t well equipped. Ukraine may well allow Russia to attempt to take the initiative, in order to decimate Russian forces more comprehensively (armies generally suffer more on the offensive). Then, Ukraine can do what it has proven very adept at doing - counteroffensive against weakened, demoralized, and worn-down Russian forces.

You know, I'm a Reddit strategist, AKA I don't have a fucking clue what I'm talking about and I freely admit it, but I actually think he's on to something here.

A. The Kherson offensive took a LOT of troops. They need recuperation of course, but sooner or later they'll be free again. And with all the bridges across the Dnipro destroyed, a lot of them will be free to be deployed elsewhere.

B. That area around Zaporizhia really doesn't have a lot of Russian troops. Putting pressure there really wouldn't be hard.

C. If you have the Kerch bridge damaged, and you grab a few highways and rail lines to the Crimea, then for the Russians, to organise a defence there would just be Kherson 2.0. Just not doable.

People forget the world's going to hell in a handbasket and we're going to get another mild winter anyway.  Russians don't think laterally; they don't even try to go through fields.  They stay on roads.  There are videos of them being surprised as fuck to see Ukrainians charging at them through adjacent fields.  It never occurred to them and their gasbuckets probably couldn't take those routes under the best of conditions.  So if any mud occurs and if it matters at all (it really didn't matter much last spring no matter how often people keep mentioning it), then it would only slow down Ukrainian counteroffensives, *maybe*, but Russia won't do anything differently.  Unless somebody's drones just shut down in freezing temps, but they seem to be rated for it.  

Of course I expect big things to happen in the winter, but it won't be as a result of or in spite of any weather pattern.  Ukraine has to address the infrastructure problem, make Kherson livable again, lines have to form in Zaporizhzhia, the north Donbas front will have to break for somebody, not sure who but it will break by winter.  It is the bloodiest, most ridiculous piece of the front since 2014 and it'll come to a head.  

Russia's economy will be officially in the shitter by January; no trade deal with China can save it and it would come at a heavy price.  Iran is supplying goods, not trade.  They are bartering for these missiles and drones with other equipment, not cash.  They have no cash.  And rials are as worthless to Russia as rubles are to Iran right now.  The question is what Russia does in response to that.  Possibly move up the second mobilization wave, which will increase domestic tensions.  It might also force Lukashenko's hand, who up to now has been desperate to do the bare minimum.  They don't have much to contribute except extending the frontlines.

Their goal would be that by March it would be nearly suicidal for Ukraine to attack Russian held territory using their entrenchments and the natural defense of the Dnipro.

The generals come from the same failing political system; they aren't there because they are the best or most brilliant minds in the Russian Federation, they're there because of political connections or reputation. They're loyalists expanding their own networks of patronage and graft.

Look at Shoigu: no military experience, named General of the Army when he was assigned the defence portfolio. His background? Civil engineering and administration, no military experience whatsoever. Zolotov, the Rosgvardiya chief? Named General of the Army, was briefly an enlisted man in the Border Troops and then Putin's bodyguard and boxing partner.

Sure, there are actual generals, too, but they don't come out of a system or society that produces innovative thinkers. 'General Armageddon' is known for what? Bombing innocent Syrians in their flats. Not exactly re-writing Clausewitz.",False,1668247001.0,t3_ysvyra,t1_iw20x49,,1,23,0,23,0,0,

If it's attacking annexed territory like Crimea, that line was crossed as soon as the war began.

If it's retaking occupied territory, that actually happened pretty early on too.

If it's taking annexed territory that was considered Russian by the authorities and puppet states, that's been happening for weeks now- and literally just happened again.

If it's attacking Russian territory **globally** seen as Russian, Belgorod is a frequent target still.

So, if this is reminding people that Russia has WMDs, so far all the red lines suggest that regaining Crimea is 100% fine, and the only thing left really is conquering Russian territory that is universally seen as Russian- **maybe**.

the elastic shock-absorbers of my Party training began to operate at once. I had eyes to see, and a mind conditioned to explain away
what they saw. This 'inner censor' is more reliable and effective than any official censorship. . . . It helped me to overcome my
doubts and to re-arrange my impressions in the desired pattern.

By setting up this automatic sorting machine in his mind, it was still possible in 1933 for a European to live in Russia and yet to remain a Communist. All my friends had that automatic sorting machine in their heads. The Communist mind has perfected the techniques of self-deception in the same manner as its techniques of

>How much longer does this have to go on...

This will continue until a group or individual decides that Putin is weak enough to be removed. In order for this to happen, various groups must reach a ""secret consensus"" that change has to occur and that a replacement should be chosen. This is tricky as many folks currently in power wish to stay there, and not be sidelined in a post-Putin purge. In addition, agreements between competing groups who have completely different visions might take some time.

1. Ukraine had more soldiers at the front that can be redeployed elsewhere than Russia
2. The river is a natural barrier and while its unlikely that Ukraine will launch an offensive from there, the risk for that stays and Russia is forced to keep more troops there to not risk Ukraine gaining a foothold on the other side of the river
3. Thats highly speculative for now, but we know Russia left in a hurry and again left a lot of equipment behind. Equipment that will help Ukraine in the longrun and equipment that Russia needs to replace again.

* Strike logistics/command (e.g., HIMARS) to weaken enemy forces
* Attack where enemy lines and rear-lines are weakest

Izyum/Lyman were examples of Ukraine attacking/exploiting weakened points in Russian lines, and Kherson was effectively a siege that Russia lost. It's also important to note that a key factor has been minimizing the risk of Ukrainian casualties (both military & civilian).

That being said, Ukraine will only roll the dice and attack/advance in areas where they *know* they will succeed. They'll continue to strike Russian logistics/command - probably in the directions of Melitopol/Mariupol, Svatove, and Severodonetsk, as these are the less-fortified regions Russia took earlier this year.

You know, for entire left bank of Ukraine, perceiving self as russian is not all that far-fetched.  Especially if you were raised by soviet grandparents.  I don’t mean it’s the norm, but even Ukrainians who post to this sub have mentioned it (adding that after invasion, they quickly rid themselves of such feelings). 

I first read it myself when simply reading Gogol’s Wikipedia page, there’s a few sentences (or at least used to be) about why he’s considered Russian and not Ukrainian. 

On that public-access news website 0629, they have about one lengthy interview each week.  There’s one from about two months ago from a regional elementary school supervisor (a boss of several principals) and he gives a lot of his opinions, observations, analysis regarding why Ukrainians can be pro-Russia, why some folks are altogether indifferent.  For example, he talks about Greeks he knows there in the city, how some are pro, some are neutral/indifferent, most are indifferent.  He attributes a lot to media influence, a high number of teachers who are actual Russian citizens, and ironically, having a democratic/laissez-faire approach to political parties or social factors that pro-Russia/antiUkraine for the sake of diversity or non interference.  He thinks it allowed the toxic beliefs to fester, grow.  He thinks there should have been big social programs to explain why Mariupol is Ukraine, or at least for children, who he says could’ve been saturated with pro-Russia beliefs at home. 

Which reminds me of an article I summarized/translated several days ago.  He was also a POW from Azovstal—not a fighter, either—he was a professor of military history and had been hired, had a contract to teach military history courses to the young men.  He basically got caught up with a battalion and stayed at Azovstal.  His interview, available in Russian https://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/articles/2022/11/9/7375470/, which I posted about here: https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yq80fm/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/ivnkc7v/
to be honest, the first half of it, I’m like, “what’s with this Russophile?” But after a while, I realized it’s actually that he’s so academically minded, that he’s a bit nuanced and speaking on a different level.  He’s basically praising all these Russian things from history, literature—well, he’s a professor—but after a while, it becomes apparent although he can appreciate those things, that it does not make it that he himself therefore feels it’s part of him in the sense of he’s now supposed to feel that Mariupol should be part of Russia.  
In captivity, he basically engaged in all these intellectual conversations, like with the FSB.  

I’m saying this to say—not everyone [left bank Ukraine] can comprehend the nuance, the dissonance—“we speak Russian + we used to be part of Russian empire =/= but we are not Russians, we are Ukrainians”—like this high iq professor can.  Any “we are Ukraine” campaign wasn’t a big enough, thorough enough, all-inclusive enough  campaign.  But that Mariupol school superintendent alluded to the fact such is necessary to penetrate the minds.  That for those in Donetsk, Lugansk, it could take years.  And have to also be comfortable with the fact that this would essentially be anti-propaganda propaganda.",1668270163.0,1668269971.0,t3_ysvyra,t1_iw249iq,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

The reason Russia ended the stalemate was that the Ukrainian troops were successfully beating back the soldiers who were part of the puppet states and that the US seemed likely to amp up support if left unattended. Russia ended the stalemate because it believed if it waited any longer than Ukraine might have been able to reclaim the Donbas with US aid.

At this point the West as a whole (not just the US) seems to collectively want Ukraine to either hold the line at *least* or win overwhelmingly at most.

The Ukrainian military is hardened, upskilled, and well-supplied.

The Russian military desperately needs a breather to train the freshly mobilized (and future mobilized) troops, needs better equipment, and substantial international aid.

Iran and the DPRK is giving substantial aid, but can't really match the US. China, India, and the rest of the ""neutrally"" nations like making money in one way or another but don't see much reason to let Russia dominate for one reason or another (or stop Ukraine from winning either). Orban for that matter gives rhetorical support like China but would happily throw Putin off a cliff if it gave him tons of cash.

It's hard to see the diplomatic direction changing much. World hunger is a problem- as is threatening to destroy Ukrainian supply to drive up global prices. Energy prices is an issue- but it didn't seem to help Russia's allies in Italy, as both of them are still required by their main coalition partner to follow it and the rest of Europe. Thinking on it, even if Iran quashes the protests and sends military units it might harden attitudes among the far right against Russia after cultivating it for decades.

A stalemate can buy time, but while it may convince the West to force Ukraine to negotiate (I can't see a Munich solution without Ukraine), it could also convince the West to **amp up its supplies to get the war finished**.

 >The Paris Declaration respecting Maritime Law of 16 April 1856 was an international multilateral treaty agreed to by the warring parties in the Crimean War gathered at the Congress at Paris after the peace treaty of Paris had been signed in March 1856. As an important juridical novelty in international law the treaty for the first time created the possibility for nations that were not involved in the establishment of the agreement and did not sign, to become a party by acceding the declaration afterwards. So did altogether 55 nations, which wouldn't otherwise haven't been possible in such a short period. A big step in the globalisation of international law.

Arguably, the best way to do that is to break the Russian army’s will to fight. Again arguably, one way to do that, is to draw them into making militarily bad moves, such as attacking against bad odds. 

Then, when their army is broken, push the remains out of Ukraine. 

The alternative is that Ukraine must choose somewhere to attack. A glance at the map will show that Kherson was the obvious Russian weak spot, where they were overextended and isolated. Now, the front is going to be shorter, making Russian defence easier - thus a Ukrainian attack more costly. 

Everyone is pouring over the map, looking for likely places Ukraine could fruitfully attack.

While yes *technically* Wagner is not legitimized and allowed to operate as a PMC, Putin has enacted a network of other laws to make it impossible for, lets say, a prosecutor or journalist to go after Wagner. Which goes back to my point about Russia and their legal system. They use corrupt laws as tools to solve problems and inconsistincies with other laws that are troublesome. Their answer to everything is to legislate, but as their is no REAL political opposition to Putin they can construct whatever necessary political technology they want to make it ""work"", for the political rulers at any rate.

You keep repeating that. But When? Point me to the comment. You haven't actually *said* anything other than contradictions and insults to myself and others. Where is your argument? It so far seems to be a mixture of ""nuh-uhh"" and ""you are an idiot"", with some extra words sprinkled in.

Lets make it real simple. True or false:

**A) Russia deliberately uses it's complex, highly developed and corrupt internal legal system to facilitate its geopolitical aims.**

**B) Russia has a complex and highly developed (and very, very corrupt) legal system.**

THEREFORE a *legalist* society. And I shouldn't have to clarify that I am not talking about the Chinese philosophy definition of legalism (*a la* legalism V confucianism). I am talking about a government that is intensely interested, perhaps overly so, with creating legal framework for their society at large. And just to be completely 100% clear, t*his does not speak to whether the political or society elite themselves are interested in following or are in practice bound by these laws.* Hence the whole corrupt thing, because the society and political elite is where most of the corrupt actions and decisions originate from and happen, in the majority of cases.

I don't see how you could in good faith claim that either premises or the resulting derived definition are incorrect. And this is, in essence, what I said in the beginning and you took enourmous issue with. Like, whats the problem? And be specific. Provide reasoning. No insults.

I quoted your comments twice, can see above. If you see no contradictions in what I quoted from you, I’m afraid I can’t help with reading comprehension, sorry. Just leave it.

Yeah, you didn’t have to bother repeating it. I said I got your point: a complex legal system that doesn’t follow its own laws is a *legalist society* to you. Putin who can pass any law cannot call it war because there will be legal consequences, so he must beat himself up with other laws…

not legal consequences. political consequences. He has this massive illusion to maintain for both the populace and his power circles. The heavily maintained and manicured legal system is a big part of this.

But I get it now. You are reading the word ""legalist"" and are maybe not separating lawful and morally upright as distinct ideas. It's a weird example if you are not already familiar, the game dungeons and dragons has a ""lawful evil"" disposition for it's actors, EG a character that follows the law but either uses said law for evil purposes or follows the law so strictly even though it breeds evil actions. It's an evil character, albeit a lawful one. As a whole that's too simplistic of an analogy to apply to Russia, but there are some parallels there. Sharia Law or the biblical old testament are another example in that the law states that a girl who is raped must be executed for infidelity. The vast majority of people in western society would not agree that is an upright law, but in some places even now is in effect and acted upon for whatever benefit it serves the law's authors.

That is simply the point that I am making. Russias maligned military and geopolitical operations happen very much in harmony and accordance with it's own laws, with the famous Wagner group example existing in a very carefully constructed and maintained grey area, just to address that. The article I linked adresses in detail why they have remained in this quasi-legal/quasi-illegal grey area.

But as an example, look at Alexei Navalny. Could Putin have him shot in the street or hung in the center of Moscow? Sure, he has the raw political and executive power to do so. But he does not have the *legal* power, as the current law stands. This specific setback does not bother Putin or hinder him from accomplishing his objectives. However, he cannot easily just execute Navalny as it would damage the lawful society illusion. So they, the executive government,  trump up some violations and kangaroo court Navalny and bring legal ""charges"" of medium length sentence after medium length sentence until he is in forever. The laws that Navalny is charged with are still very real, even if many of them were practically ad-hoc. But in an ultra legalistic nation you can convict and punish someone of anything if the court is not independent. That concept is why defense lawyers are necessary (and can be functional as long as the system as a whole permits them to actually win against the state).

I mean, it's a fiction, but watch the Death of Stalin. Fantastic movie and I am giving a spoiler but when Beria is unseated from power it is done under the auspices of 45 second trial and then he is summarily executed. This is and has been the Russian Zeitgeist in the last 70 years. As the ruler you have the law, and the law is your tool.

But back to Navalny, the average politically disengaged Russian watching thinks it's all very procedural and above board. There's nothing wrong with it as long as you are subscribing to the big story. They will consume the engineered punditry that Navalny has violated such and such ""actual"" laws and therefore deserves the legal consequences. It is of course twisted. It's arguably worse than a lawless system where you are killed just because the tyrant says so. At least in that event the lines of power are marked and open. The Russian system is grey, murky and necessarily weaponized.  But to the marginally politically engaged citizen it is, in their limited view, legally intact.

But let's squash it please. This whole argument is purely semantics. We actually completely agree on the state of Russian affairs and government, but you just don't like the words that I am using because you are attributing a different meaning to them and I guess you are assuming I am attributing positive characteristics to Russian governance when I most definitely am not. A piece of unwarranted advice: seek some clarification before you go on the attack. And mea culpa. I made insulting and arrogant comments when that was neither productive nor helping with clear communication and on that front I duly apologize.
