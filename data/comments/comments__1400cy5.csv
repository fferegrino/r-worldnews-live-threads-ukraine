There were some more attacks on Moscow this week, seemingly a drone assault, probably launched by the SBU, in which the drones were shot down by Pantsir missiles and crashed into some residential apartments. Another uncomfortable reminder to Russians about how war goes both ways.  
  
A great deal of Ukrainians who I have talked to recently, especially but not only in Kyiv, have mentioned the incessant Russian bomb and drone attacks and how they cannot get enough sleep during the night, which would probably explain why some don't show up to my 8 o'clock classes. The ""bad neighbours"" (as my students often call them) have gone all in on a strategy of sleep deprivation to win the war. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians are now unleashing devastating new attacks on Russian rear bases using Storm Shadow missiles. These bases were moved out of range of HIMARS, and the West has been playing a very canny game, like a cat toying with its prey, in that as soon as the Russians have moved out of range, they give Ukraine a new weapon to devastate the next row of bases. This is probably more of a side effect from the West's delays in sending weapons rather than a cause of it, though.  
  
The Russian Volunteer Corps have reportedly taken control of the town of Novaya Tavolzhanka in Belgorod Oblast and have taken prisoners too. It seems obvious to me that these raids are all part of a strategy designed to get the Kremlin to wean troops away from where the counteroffensive will actually start to places where they will be less useful.  
  
F-16s are now officially approved for Ukraine, though not from the United States.   
  
The talk of the coming counteroffensive seems to be increasing. I can't say when it will start, only that some time this month seems to be the most reasonable guess. According to various sources the Ukrainians are moving their troops close to the assembly areas, which means it should be within a month or so, if I use the same type of timetable as the Ardennes offensive (for one example). They are obviously trying to scrounge up every single armoured vehicle they can get their hands on for the attack and don't want to push things until maximum superiority in their favour has been achieved. As usual, they are totally resistant to any haranguing and urging, and are totally reliant on military logic. I have faith and confidence they will be able to reach the Black Sea and from there go straight into Crimea.

The evacuator—whose personal photos are on exhibit—says that the stubborn civilians are all psychologically ‘off,’ blaming the months of stress and isolation in basements, saying that they become ‘normal’ again after evacuation. 

One family with two children were in an active zone in Bakhmut as late as end of February.  They locked selves in, wouldn’t answer door, single-dwelling house.  But at night, the evacuator could see faint hue of light, and in day, saw smoke from cooking.  She’d been told there were two children hiding with parents.  When she eventually got inside, discovered there was also a 6-week old baby there, too! She had to employ the final method (below)—the most extreme—to get them out:

*Evacuation deceptions & techniques:*


- Tell them that UA is withdrawing, UA boys will no longer protect, implying that will hand over Bakhmut to Russian control or that they’ll be in the zone targeted by UA. [deception]

- agree to evacuate the not just the pets, but also the urban livestock—the chickens—too.  *Hundreds* of chickens.  Under fire.  Through a mined road. 

- Say that must take out children now [new law requires parent to accompany to safety] and after child is safe, adult can return for that property that they’re ‘protecting’—a new refrigerator!—although civilians actually wouldn’t have been let back in for any reason, and evacuator knew it [deception]

- Tell the pious that God had sent the evacuation-volunteers, if they now go meet their Maker [get killed bc won’t evacuate], don’t complain to God that He didn’t save them—bc God has sent this volunteer to save and they are rejecting

- Bring Kholodny Yar boys along, ***break in***, let Kholodny Yar tell them that they’d **“received orders” to set up artillery** at that location. [deception]





Sidenote, she also says that **all the children** kept/hidden in Bakhmut at the end ***were girls***.  Boys got evacuated—unclear if that’s just a coincidence.

^(*) ^(Regarding the auction, *Facts* writes:)


> ^(After the end of the *Bakhmut Fortress* exhibition, part of the exhibits will be sold, Oksana Volzhyna explains:)

> > ^(We will spend the money we make [from the auction] for a ""Stork"" drone. This is very important, because **it has become almost impossible to work with drones in the Bakhmut area: the enemy actively uses EW**[electronic warfare means] there.  In addition, the most popular Chinese drones, which we purchased for the Armed Forces, became difficult to obtain, because China limits their sale abroad. So it is necessary to switch to wing [aircraft]. The wing-type is safer for the operator—it can go much farther, so the enemy's mortars wont be able to target operators’ locations as much.)

> ^(Souvenir magnets are also being auctioned—they were made from parts of a Russian **aircraft shot down in Bakhmut from the window of a high-rise building** with the help of an Igla MANPADS about **a month ago**.)

> > ^(“By the way, yes, in the Bakhmut region, a **fighter of the 93rd** with the call sign *Shlyah* **shot down a Russian helicopter with a hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher**,” added a veteran of the 93rd named Artur. “The guys were waiting for a Russian tank to show up in clearing area, and then a helicopter suddenly appeared and *Shlyah* 
hit it.)



> ^(Why is a bottle of *Artemivsky* champagne up for auction?)

> > ^(That is the last bottle that our guys found in the cellar of the local champagne factory. It was signed by an ace sniper from the 93rd ""Zhereb"" brigade. During the full-scale war, he was wounded three times.  Extreme times, very strongly. He is a very cool pro, fighting since 2014. We will put many other things up for auction, including a wall clock signed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Valery Zaluzhny; ""Russian ships go to..."" stamps signed by the famous boxer Oleksandr Usyk; a downed Russian drone; the book ""Kholodny Yar,"" signed by guys from the 93rd Brigade; and a steam train [sculpture] made of salt, which the fighters managed to save from Soledar.)

>**‘Everything Changed’: The War Arrives on Russians’ Doorstep**  
>  
>*With cross-border strikes, residents of the Russian region of Belgorod are starting to understand the horrors of war being waged at their doorstep.*  
>  
>Over the last five days of May, Ruslan, an English teacher in a Russian town near the Ukrainian border, heard the distinct sound of a multiple rocket launcher strike for the first time. Shelling would begin around 3 a.m., sometimes shaking his house, and continue through the morning.  
>  
>He had heard the thud of explosions in distant villages in the past, he said, and in October shelling damaged a nearby shopping mall. But nothing like this.  
>  
>“Everything changed,” he said.  
>  
>Fifteen months after Russian missiles first roared toward Kyiv, residents of the Russian border region of Belgorod are starting to understand the horror of having war on their doorstep.  
>  
>Shebekino, a town of 40,000 six miles from the border, has effectively become a new part of the front line as Ukraine has intensified attacks inside Russia, including on residential areas near its own borders. The spate of assaults, most recently by militia groups aligned against Moscow, has sparked the largest military evacuation effort in Russia in decades.  
>  
>“The town became a ghost in 24 hours,” said Ruslan, 27, who evacuated on Thursday after a sustained campaign of shelling.  
>  
>In the last several days, The New York Times interviewed more than half a dozen residents of the border region to get a sense of the deepening anxiety among Russian civilians. Like Ruslan, most insisted on being identified by only their first names, citing a fear of retribution for speaking about the war.  
>  
>“Shebekino was a wonderful, flowery town on the border with Ukraine filled with happy, neighborly people,” said Darya, 37, a local public sector employee. “Now only pain, death and misery live in our town. There is no power, no public transport, no open businesses, no residents. Just an empty, shattered town in smoke.”  
>  
>The hardship is familiar to Ukrainians, who have seen cities like Bakhmut obliterated and others ravaged by civilian casualties. So are the sleepless nights; Russian missiles targeted Kyiv at least 17 times in May. But many Russians had not expected something similar to happen on their home turf.  
>  
>Explosions are audible, too, in the city of Belgorod, the regional capital 20 miles to the north of Shebekino, and residents there have increasingly begun seeking access to basements that can be used as bomb shelters. People who had previously tried to go about their daily business suddenly discovered they could not.  
>  
>“We are at a turning point right now,” said Oleg, a businessman in the city. “When this all started,” he said, referring to the war, “the people who opposed it here were a minority. Now after four days of being shelled, people are changing their minds.”  
>  
>Belgorod’s regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said 2,500 residents had been evacuated and taken to temporary shelters in sports arenas farther from the border. Thousands more left on their own accord, residents said in interviews.  
>  
>Mr. Gladkov said nine residents had died from shelling over the past three days. It is unclear how many Russians in the border region have been killed overall, but this was almost surely the deadliest week for the Belgorod region since the start of the war.  
>  
>...  
>  
>As footage of that shelling filled Belgorod’s public chat rooms, citizens volunteered to drive affected families to safety, donated money and opened homes to refugees. In doing so, they underlined what they said was the inadequacy of the local government’s response, and the growing realization that they had only themselves to rely on.  
>  
>...  
>  
>To some in the region, the assaults on Shebekino, the most sustained attack on a Russian town since the start of the war, made clear Moscow’s lack of concern for their fate. In social media posts, they used the hashtag #ShebekinoIsRussia, a cry for attention from the wider public across the country, which has largely carried on with daily life. In interviews, some in Shebekino expressed anger at how state television anchors struggled to pronounce the town’s name, even as they lauded the evacuation efforts.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Despite an uptick of attacks on Russian soil, only one in four Russians is following the war closely and most likely going beyond state media to seek information about it, according to a May poll conducted by the independent Moscow-based public opinion firm Levada Center. Almost half of respondents said they don’t follow the conflict at all, or only cursorily.

You exhausted all your offensive potential, you're bracing for an ever-increasing likelihood of a major defensive battle with forces very different from what you had at the peak, all while the enemy is making significant moves in your vulnerable underbelly at your pre-war borders.

Things indeed seem so bad that I sometimes think they are giving up on purpose. Their channels are all just sharing each other's statements about the ""nazis"", it's so much cope and zero substance, no clear military narrative. Prigozhin is the only one appearing in public but he's hardly convincing or reassuring, just trolling. 

I think Russia could be at the negotiating table right now begging Ukraine and the Allies to agree to peace conditions in order to have a chance to save the country.

And this is just how things are right this moment, before anything that's coming has happened... (which I have no insights into).

> The [Russian] ministry, in a rare early morning video, said its forces pushed back a “large scale” Ukrainian assault on Sunday at five points in southern Donetsk, one of four Ukrainian regions Russia illegally annexed last fall.

> “The enemy’s goal was to break through our defenses in the most vulnerable, in its opinion, sector of the front,” said the ministry’s spokesman, Igor Konashenkov. “The enemy did not achieve its tasks. It had no success.”

> Konashenkov said 250 Ukrainian personnel were killed, and 16 Ukrainian tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles and 21 armored combat vehicles were destroyed.

> Ukraine didn’t comment, and often waits until the completion of its military operations to confirm its actions, **imposing news blackouts** in the interim.  **It was unclear why the Russian Defense Ministry waited until Monday morning to announce the attack, which it said started Sunday morning.**

> The Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said Ukraine used six mechanized and two tank battalions in the attack, and it released a video claiming to show destruction of some of the equipment in a field.

> In a rare specific mention of the presence of Russia’s top military leaders in battlefield operations, the spokesman said the chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Gen. Valery **Gerasimov, “was at one of the forward command posts**.”

> Announcing Gerasimov’s direct involvement could be a response to criticism by some Russian military bloggers and mercenary group head Yevgeny Prigozhin that Russia’s military brass hasn’t been visible enough at the front or taken sufficient control or responsibility for their country’s military operations in Ukraine.",1685935549.0,1685935180.0,t3_1400cy5,t3_1400cy5,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

Erdogan just cares about himself and his interests, he doesn’t particularly care about how the war ends and the global world order as long as he gets something himself. In that way Erdogan is annoying, but predictable.

Report

I hereby report that on May 17, 2023, the Company employees received information that in the area of the settlement Experienced and n.p. Ozaryanovka, groups of the Ministry of Defense were seen mining roads in the rear zone of Wagner PMC units.

On this day, a group of sappers of the 1st ISR advanced to the engineering reconnaissance of the indicated road section. We found land mines in the form of a large number of plastids, anti-tank mines and artillery brought to positions shells, installed in a controlled version of the Ministry of Defense. After a preliminary inspection of the mining sites, the groups began to clear the roads, but were forced to stop work because in the area of the settlement. Semigorye, at about 15.40 fire from small arms was opened on them from the positions of the Ministry of Defense.

As a result, the URAL service car was disabled by a direct hit on the engine, the personnel were not injured.

The groups dismounted, and dispersed, took retaliatory measures

to eliminate aggression and arrest.

They turned out to be military personnel of the RF Ministry of Defense. The leader of this group was an officer of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Commander of the 72nd Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade, lieutenant colonel of military unit 13647, who was in a state of alcohol intoxication.

>  
>*With cross-border strikes, residents of the Russian region of Belgorod are starting to understand the horrors of war being waged at their doorstep.*  
>  
>Over the last five days of May, Ruslan, an English teacher in a Russian town near the Ukrainian border, heard the distinct sound of a multiple rocket launcher strike for the first time. Shelling would begin around 3 a.m., sometimes shaking his house, and continue through the morning.  
>  
>He had heard the thud of explosions in distant villages in the past, he said, and in October shelling damaged a nearby shopping mall. But nothing like this.  
>  
>“Everything changed,” he said.  
>  
>Fifteen months after Russian missiles first roared toward Kyiv, residents of the Russian border region of Belgorod are starting to understand the horror of having war on their doorstep.  
>  
>Shebekino, a town of 40,000 six miles from the border, has effectively become a new part of the front line as Ukraine has intensified attacks inside Russia, including on residential areas near its own borders. The spate of assaults, most recently by militia groups aligned against Moscow, has sparked the largest military evacuation effort in Russia in decades.  
>  
>“The town became a ghost in 24 hours,” said Ruslan, 27, who evacuated on Thursday after a sustained campaign of shelling.  
>  
>In the last several days, The New York Times interviewed more than half a dozen residents of the border region to get a sense of the deepening anxiety among Russian civilians. Like Ruslan, most insisted on being identified by only their first names, citing a fear of retribution for speaking about the war.  
>  
>“Shebekino was a wonderful, flowery town on the border with Ukraine filled with happy, neighborly people,” said Darya, 37, a local public sector employee. “Now only pain, death and misery live in our town. There is no power, no public transport, no open businesses, no residents. Just an empty, shattered town in smoke.”  
>  
>The hardship is familiar to Ukrainians, who have seen cities like Bakhmut obliterated and others ravaged by civilian casualties. So are the sleepless nights; Russian missiles targeted Kyiv at least 17 times in May. But many Russians had not expected something similar to happen on their home turf.  
>  
>Explosions are audible, too, in the city of Belgorod, the regional capital 20 miles to the north of Shebekino, and residents there have increasingly begun seeking access to basements that can be used as bomb shelters. People who had previously tried to go about their daily business suddenly discovered they could not.  
>  
>“We are at a turning point right now,” said Oleg, a businessman in the city. “When this all started,” he said, referring to the war, “the people who opposed it here were a minority. Now after four days of being shelled, people are changing their minds.”  
>  
>Belgorod’s regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said 2,500 residents had been evacuated and taken to temporary shelters in sports arenas farther from the border. Thousands more left on their own accord, residents said in interviews.  
>  
>Mr. Gladkov said nine residents had died from shelling over the past three days. It is unclear how many Russians in the border region have been killed overall, but this was almost surely the deadliest week for the Belgorod region since the start of the war.  
>  
>...  
>  
>As footage of that shelling filled Belgorod’s public chat rooms, citizens volunteered to drive affected families to safety, donated money and opened homes to refugees. In doing so, they underlined what they said was the inadequacy of the local government’s response, and the growing realization that they had only themselves to rely on.  
>  
>...  
>  
>To some in the region, the assaults on Shebekino, the most sustained attack on a Russian town since the start of the war, made clear Moscow’s lack of concern for their fate. In social media posts, they used the hashtag #ShebekinoIsRussia, a cry for attention from the wider public across the country, which has largely carried on with daily life. In interviews, some in Shebekino expressed anger at how state television anchors struggled to pronounce the town’s name, even as they lauded the evacuation efforts.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Despite an uptick of attacks on Russian soil, only one in four Russians is following the war closely and most likely going beyond state media to seek information about it, according to a May poll conducted by the independent Moscow-based public opinion firm Levada Center. Almost half of respondents said they don’t follow the conflict at all, or only cursorily.

First, fatalism has always been rather a fairly common feature of Russian culture going back centuries. 

Then you get two instances in the last 100 or so years where Russia had an upheaval, and there was a promise  of a better future, in 1917, and 1991, but in both cases the opportunity was quickly appropriated by an elite class and order was enforced very harshly. The Stalinist times were much more repressive of course, but the 90s were still a time of severe poverty and misery for most Russians, and anyone who thought that a western liberal economy might be better than the Soviet planned economy got a rude awakening as the oligarchs consolidated control over everything. 

It's no surprise that Putin was popular early on as oil prices helped rose, crime rates fell, and people again started to hope that, this time, things might be different. Urban Russia actually started to get a good standard of living, and many at that point decided that this is probably the best they can get, and they should do everything they can to keep it that way. Kremlin propaganda was only too happy to oblige, making sure that any opposition and even Putin's own party seemed unhinged, radical, and unpredictable, while Putin was the only source of stability and security. This was the beginning of the social contract in Russia: ""Keep your heads down, don't interfere with us, and we'll keep things like this,"" the government said. 

Well after 2012, when Putin came back to power, hundreds of thousands of Russians protested against his return, and that's when repressions really started to kick in, and the propaganda shifted up a gear into this ""firehose of bullshit"" we see today. Any real opposition figures were finished off when Nemtsov was killed, and social media closely watched, leaving Russians with pretty much no alternative to fight for, no methods to organize protest, and harsh consequences for those that tried anyway. All the while, this omnipresent message keeps playing ""truth doesn't exist, the whole world is crazy, everything is shit, no one cares about you, life is meaningless"". Sadly, most couldn't handle the crushing weight of it, and decided to block it out altogether, and focus on the things they felt mattered: their job, their friends, their family. 

I don't say any of this to justify or excuse it. They will inevitably have to face the reality at some point, only the later they leave it, the worse it will be, and the consequences will be catastrophic for them. At the same time, I think it's good for the world to understand how such a mass apathy can happen, because it is not something unique or exclusive exclusive Russians - it can happen anywhere to anyone under the same conditions. The average Brit did not care to know what their imperialist government was doing to native people around the world, the Germans didn't care to know what their government was doing to Jews, and one day, I'm sure there will be another nation who doesn't care what their government does to someone else.

With dreams of greatness, shining so bright.

The war in Iraq was a devastating mistake at best, and a cash grab by the corrupt politicians being paid by defense contractors at worst.  

But, let's not forget some very key differences before we compare ourselves to Russia, shall we?

Saddam Hussein was a dictator who used violence and genocide to stay in power.  He gassed the Kurdish minority with chemical weapons to show the world that he wasn't afraid to use them.  His sons drove through the countryside picking up young girls to rape and then murder, and then sent their mutilated corpses back to their family as a message.

Ukraine on the other hand, has a democratically elected leader, in stark contrast to Iraq, and indeed, Russia.  

Furthermore, the reason Russia has invaded Ukraine, is to annex it.  You know, like Hitler did with all of Europe during WW2.  Whatever you think about the United States invading Iraq, and I totally agree it was a mistake mind you, it was not a war of annexation or to secure resources.  The United States did not get the benefit of any of Iraq's oil wealth.  

If you want to ascribe a nefarious purpose for the war in Iraq, it was to enrich corporations like Halliburton (later KBR.) 

Frankly, I think the majority of the administration actually believed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.  I certainly think Colin Powell believed it.  

Human intelligence is very easy to get wrong.  It's an inherently incentive-based business.  Money is given in exchange for information.  On the upper tier of things, political influence and lucrative contracts are promised for intelligence.  If you keep asking about the same thing (WMDs, Saddam's support for terrorism etc.) you will eventually find someone willing to give you that information, truthful or not.  There are plenty of unscrupulous and desperate people willing to lie for the right incentive.  That's why you don't typically see Special Forces or Navy Seals sent out to fight on the basis of single-source reporting.

Throw in groupthink, and you get the Iraq War.

My understanding is there are two groups of Russians who volunteer in Ukraine. One is fairly normal Russians that don't like the leadership in Russia and the other one has some fairly undesirable elements (white supremacy types) mixed in and in leadership of their element, kind of like Azov battalion in Ukraine. These two groups of Russians have been doing raids into Russian territory taking ground, retreating when Russia gathers to oppose, and then dipping in other places along the border to repeat the cycle. This is drawing equipment and personnel out of Ukraine and back into Russia to defend which Russia can't transfer back because they keep popping in and out of Russia at various points.

As for the media in Russia I have only seen limited mention of it, IIRC Solovyov [\(spelling? the angry Russian propaganda dude\)](https://i.imgur.com/PmgPWBd.jpg) and few others mentioned it the first time it happened but I haven't seen much since.

Edit: It looks like there is something new out on covering the last few days: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7liS0qRa18

After watching it, and how they edited/framed the footage, I think they are going to try to use fear and try to drive the population into supporting either a full mobilization or at least another similar mobilization. I'm not sure how the Russian public will react to that but if they successfully go for full mobilization that might be somewhat worrisome if only due to Russia's population advantage. There are a whole lot of things to sus out if that happens though. I don't think they will have the equipment to supply that level and even if they commit to a full war economy they are already having problems finding workers, so who the fuck knows.

They had a test where the instructor would try and lose the student pilot and this guy followed them through it all, they could never shake him. From the very first time they did this training this guy was glued to their wingtip and they could not lose him. They said virtually all students took some time before they really understood what the jet was capable of and how to use it in the real world. He also did really well in all the class room work, was physically very fit and a very professional and personable guy, you could tell everyone liked him.

For the next stage of training they did simulated dog fights where you had to keep track of friendly and enemy targets in a situation where they entered the clouds and then emerge from the clouds and the student pilot had to decide who to shoot down *without using the friend or foe identification systems.* The way they flew the engagement would mean that if you understood where the two planes entered the clouds each could only ever end up where they were when they emerged from the clouds. This student simply couldn't keep track in his head what other planes were doing in the battle space. He could fly the airplane like a savant but he could not keep track of what was going on during combat. He kept shooting down the friendly airplane in multiple simulated engagements and that's it, he was out and done as a combat pilot.

You could tell the instructors were like ""damn I really wanted that guy to make it"" but they weren't super surprised that someone that looked so promising failed out. They said that ""you could never tell when someone's bucket was going to fill up."" They explained that they viewed a fighter pilots head like a bucket and every task you add as you advance in training is putting more water in the bucket. Flying a jet fighter requires a ridiculous amount of multitasking and things can move sooo fast that you need to ""keep ahead of the aircraft"" as one instructor put it. A student can look like they're doing amazing but then you add that one extra task on top and they just can't do it. Their brain simply can't handle everything they need to do, their bucket fills up, and it all just falls apart and they washout.

Meanwhile another student that literally almost killed themselves and an instructor in a butchered landing made it through and became a pilot. That was their one massive failure in training but they managed to do all the other things in the training time allowed to make it through. Meanwhile one the best acrobatic flyers they had ever seen doesn't make it because they kept shooting down the wrong plane. I had heard that it was very difficult to become a fighter pilot and thought I kind of got it but after watching that show I realized that just how high a level of intelligence, commitment and physical endurance it takes.

It's very disturbing to contemplate how the U.S. would be handling this war if it was President Trump right now and not President Biden.

Thankfully, I still believe a majority of elected Republicans are willing to support Ukraine.  That could all change if Trump gets elected and insists to his caucus that they support Putin instead.  The GOP has done a very poor job on standing up to Trump, to say the least.

If I had to describe my views on when it's appropriate to use military force, I guess I'd say that I'm anti-appeasement and pro-intervention on the basis of preventing genocide.  To many, that might make me appear like a hawk.
