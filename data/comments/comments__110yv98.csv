[ABC reports](https://abcnews.go.com/International/trap-video-shows-american-volunteer-killed-guided-missile/story?id=97087724):



> When watched frame-by-frame, the footage is revealing.

> A low-flying missile can be seen hurtling toward Reed’s white van ambulance which was parked at the scene.

> The images show that Reed was not killed by Russian shelling, as eyewitnesses had previously thought.^2

> Military experts say the missile visible in the footage bears all the hallmarks of an anti-tank laser-guided missile. Reed’s colleagues say the video, together with firsthand witness accounts, show that the group of international medics was deliberately targeted.

> ""They were hunting us down,"" said Erko Laidinen, a 35-year-old Estonian medic whose camera recorded the missile and the explosion.

> When Laidinen’s team of medics arrived at the scene on Feb. 2 to treat a Ukrainian woman who had been injured by shelling, another team led by Reed was already there.

> **Less than 10 seconds later,** the missile struck Reed’s white van.

> At that moment Laidinen was still inside his team’s van ambulance, which he said was clearly marked with large medical-style crosses and was parked a short distance away.

> The Estonian medic had turned his camera on a second before the explosion. Reed is clearly visible.

> He is standing by his ambulance, alongside his fellow medics. Next to him was the woman he was about to treat.

> Then a low-flying missile shoots in from right to left. ABC News has watched and verified the video.

> […]

> He believes the team of international medics were then repeatedly targeted by Russian forces, even after the initial missile attack.

*he drops his phone or the blast knocked it away...*

> The camera’s image for the next 20 minutes is just black; however, it still recorded multiple nearby explosions which Laidinen believes were incoming Russian mortars.

> Laidinen said he has additional dash cam footage that captures both the missile hitting Reed’s ambulance as well as **a second missile being fired at a vehicle, which was being used to evacuate casualties from the scene.**

> That second missile, he said, missed its target and hit a nearby residential building.

> ""The low, flat trajectory"" of the missile ""and the fact that it was slow enough to be captured on video"" suggest it was an anti-tank guided missile, according to Steve Ganyard, an ABC News contributor and a retired colonel. Ganyard has viewed the images.

> He said it was obvious the team of international volunteers were medics working on the scene.

> […]

> It took Laidinen two days to retrieve his phone and watch the video back.  It then hit home ""how dangerous it is"" for a volunteer working near the front lines in Ukraine, he said.

> ""You can easily identify the missile in the picture,"" he said.

> There is no question for him that they were **deliberately ""targeted**,"" Laidinen insisted.

> **""It is laser guided. There is nothing to debate**,"" he said.

> Laidinen said the Russian military would have known that a team of medics would have been responding to a civilian casualty on the scene.

> **""They waited for us. They knew we were coming, that we were responding,"" he said. ""It was a trap.""**

> Video footage from the scene, shown to CNN, shows the incoming missile hitting Reed’s team’s makeshift ambulance.

> Munitions experts have examined the video and identified the weapon as an anti-tank guided missile, Reed’s wife, Alex Kay Potter, told CNN after arriving back from Ukraine.

> Potter believes the attack on the aid workers was the Russian military’s intent, and says that their ambulance was clearly marked.

It's a deep dive into captured Russian orders that compares them to NATO equivalents, and makes the clearest case by far for why Russians are failing, and will keep on failing.

Highlights:

1. Russian orders are straight out of WWI.

2. There's no communication between forward units and artillery. There's no communication between separate elements. Once advance units advance far enough, there's no communication with the rear. 

3. Artillery does not use drones to correct, only for damage assessment for their own records. 

4. Orders are sets of timings for the day with no provisions for any kind of flexibility. Separate elements of the large attack have no ability to talk to each other. 

Artillery fires blind and carpets the general area for most of the day. Regardless of, and unaware of, the results of that barrage the first wave moves up at the specified minute. Regardless of, and unaware of, the first unit's status, the second wave then moves up at their specified time.

Both [*Dialog*](https://www-dialog-ua.translate.goog/war/267849_1676216307?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp) and [*Unian*](https://www-unian-net.translate.goog/russianworld/svo-provalilas-v-rossii-pridumali-novuyu-prichinu-porazheniy-svoey-armii-12142830.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)
 report on it and I’ve combined below:


> Russian political scientist and ex-deputy of the State Duma Sergei Markov said that the ""special operation"" of the Russian Federation in Ukraine failed.

> Putin's confidant contended that it was not the Russian army that turned out to be weak, but rather, the “Ukrainian army is very, very strong. The Ukrainian army is a unique combination of a Russian soldier, a fascist officer and an American general,"" the pro-Kremlin political scientist said.

> He said that the Russian Federation had been preparing for two types of wars—a nuclear war with the United States and a war with ‘paramilitary formations’ ... like with a type of Syrian-style militants, or Afghan [they’d been told the Armed Forces would flee], but ended up in a third type [of war]. We did not expect this at all. The special operation has practically failed for us. We are waging war with an enemy of equal strength,” he said.

> *He notes that the Russian army had not even managed to suppress the air defense system of Ukraine.* Markov admits that the Kremlin hoped to suppress the Ukrainian air defense, after which the aircraft of the invaders could dominate the air, but this part of the plan also failed. Russian planes do not risk flying over Ukraine. As a rule, they fly up to the border, fire missiles and quickly go deep into the Russian Federation as far as possible so that they are not shot down. The situation is similar with artillery: as soon as the Russians begin to advance, they immediately come under heavy fire from the Armed Forces of Ukraine.  Therefore, the Russian Federation did not have an army that could adequately resist the Ukrainian military.

> He noted that at such a pace, it will take them about 10-15 years to ""capture Kyiv:  If we take settlements, like how Soledar and Bakhmut took for several months, then we will reach Kyiv in 10 or 25 years,"" Markov said.

> The Russian political scientist also said that it is pointless to conduct a second wave of mobilization in the Russian Federation, since they could not arm the previous mobilized.

 that Markov, “an ardent Putin supporter,” said the following:

> ^(""The results of the year are catastrophic. The 'special military operation', which was planned to be fast and effective, turned out to be not fast, not effective,"" he complained.  He clarified that the Kremlin, through its own miscalculations, dragged Russia into a protracted and very bloody conflict, in which the number of victims has already reached hundreds of thousands. Markov also complained that, as a result of the war, there were practically no pro-Russian citizens left in Ukraine. The people and authorities are consolidated in the fight *against* the aggressor—Russia.)

> ^(One of the most important events of the past year, in his words, was the debunking of the myth of the Russian army as ""second in the world"" in its strength. ""In the eyes of the whole world, our military is assessed as extremely ineffective and incapable of solving combat missions,"" the odious political scientist said.)

> ^(Markov also acknowledged the failure of the Kremlin's hopes for a transition to a ""multipolar world."" The result of the war, in his words, was a significant strengthening of the West and the United States. ""Western civilization today, more than ever, is consolidated around the United States. And Russia turned out to be weak,"" the Kremlin political scientist said.)

> ^(He stated that the Russian Federation was defeated in this war. In the event of a final defeat, in his words, the war will move to the territory of Russia. There is also a threat of the collapse of the Russian Federation, broken into several parts. ""The defeat will lead to a catastrophe for Russian statehood and, possibly, to the liquidation of the Russian Federation as an independent state in general,"" Markov stated.)

> ^(It is noteworthy that the Putinist continues to ardently support the ""special operation"" itself. He does not accuse dictator Vladimir Putin of failures, assuring that the problem is allegedly in the ""inadequate"" state system.)",1676323032.0,1676322131.0,t3_110yv98,t3_110yv98,,0,77,0,77,0,0,

Russia (NOT a democracy) suffered tremendously from the war, but ultimately were not much better than the fascists they were fighting. Both regimes, Nazi Germany and the USSR, were genocidal monsters in the end. Many innocents died in between them.

Think of what those who resisted tyranny did back then. The forces of the West, led by the USA and Great Britain, still holding the torch for a better future. Not perfect by any means, plagued by many issues in retrospect, but compared to others, a beacon of hope for a better world. The heritage of this war laid down the foundation of the world that we live in today. It was terrible, and too many innocents died. Firebombed cities, the atomic bombs, the concentration camps, the war crimes, 60 million dead. Unparalleled destruction.

Think of what the good men and women who fought for a better future and to hold back tyranny. What would they think now? What would they do now? What is the right thing to do?

The right thing is to hold back the tide of Russian tyranny. To stand agains't the rising tide of aggressive dictatorships. Our ancestors are watching over us. The world they built, imperfect as it may be, still holds good and hope for a better future. We must try to learn from our past mistakes, our own blunderous wars, but we must also recognize and stand agains't evil when it rises. As WW2 demonstrated, some evils cannot be bargained with; they can only be defeated and brought to heel. And unfortunately, this cycle is repeating. And so must we rise to defeat it, while trying to preserve our own humanity, our own ability for restraint and self-criticism.

Democracies are under attack; from the inside and the outside. Russia, China and Iran seek to subvert our imperfect, yet still decent system, for a world order based on pure tyranny, genocide and totalitarianism. Absolute hell to live under.

dfb7707162b2ee28b4e01913a2fdb1ca,110yv98,j8dgo29,"I have some questions about the peace settlement that will take place after the war (which the Russians will lose), especially about Russia's reparations to Ukraine:

I assume that the chances are not very high (to say the least) but there must be  a starting point for discussion and thaughts.

1. the reparations will amount to a (merely material) damage of 1 to 1.5 trillion Euro / USD. This is only an estimate, it can become very many more, depending on the duration and intensity of the war. Let's assume 1.2 trillion Euro / USD.

Spread evenly over 20 years, this corresponds to 60 billion euros / USD, more than a billion per week.

3) Russia has lost a large part of its income from energy exports, trade with Russia has been severely restricted. Where should the revenues for the reparations come from?

My proposed solution is as follows:

1. trade in energy and raw materials will be allowed again for Russia.

2. 2/3 of everything that exceeds Russia's calculated costs will go to Ukraine.

3. raw materials will be extracted and transported by western companies and with western technology.

4. private property and real estate, which exceeds the amount of 3 million euros / USD, will be confiscated in favor of reparations.

5. at the same time, heavy investments will be made in the Russian educational infrastructure. All Russians should be able to receive an education and or study outside of the larger cities.

6. investments for the reconstruction of Ukraine's material damage will be prefinanced by the West on favorable terms.

7. in order to reduce corruption, mutually controlling investment institutions will be established, which, on top of that, will not receive open-ended contracts, but will have to prove that they have been commissioned to control investments and that the funds have been used correctly.

I have certainly forgotten many points and propose them for discussion.

I have not forgotten, but I have left out the immaterial damages, which I cannot assess and for which I have no proposal for regulation. These damages are immense and traumatize several generation for a long time. I have no idea how this could be handled well.

If Russia does not agree to such terms, the country will become more and more isolated and excluded from trade until it is in the Stone Age.

At the same time, there could be an offer on building up Russia, I also left that topic out - my only concern here is the discussion of reparations.

Several bad things, one regarding Bakhmut: was that both access routes Ukraine had used had been destroyed in the last day.  That can’t get tanks there.  That Russia had taken an adjacent village, are now at a higher elevation, and that as a result of these things, Ukraine can’t use artillery there and are street fighting, house to house in Bakhmut.

He also had news on other areas, saying Russia had made advances.  One was one of the towns in northern Donetsk, other was villages around Kremmina.   (Did not say Vuhledar saw RF advances.)
 
He said it appears RF Offensive has started, and that there’s concern about UA getting that needed equipment and artillery to hold the Russians off.


Edit: ok so it wasn’t new, apparently.  It [was from this](https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-2-13-23/h_51221409b321a4aa3e39c6f8ef8263eb), and says: 

> Russian artillery has blocked the main southern supply route close to the village of Chasiv Yar, which overlooks the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut and remains in Ukrainian hands, according to numerous military sources on the ground and CNN’s own observations.

> Wagner, the Russian private military company, on Sunday claimed to have captured Krasna Hora, a small village just north of Bakhmut. Russian artillery can now hit vehicles traveling on the main road to the city.

> This leaves Ukrainian forces fighting street to street combat inside the town of Bakhmut, with the prospect of using complicated resupply routes on back roads.

> The Ukrainian battle there is now also tougher because the Ukrainian artillery and tanks could not be used in the town, according to Ukrainian military sources and soldiers involved in the fight.

&nbsp;

First a very quick digression; Polish people in my experience are in general more hospitable and friendly than almost any other of the now 32 European countries I have been to at one point or an other.  (Some dont even exist anymore, btw.) They are loyal, extrovert and will invite you home and cook you a dinner for hours just to make you feel welcome as their guest. 

&nbsp;

Now, back to my point. I personally don't particularly like the current Polish government. They are too far right wing, their abortion policies in my eyes are inhuman and close to extremist and they are nationalistic in a way that is not positive.

&nbsp;

That said, Ukraine and Poland has history. And some of that history is outright ugly. From both sides. Plenty of reasons to hold grudges to be found.

&nbsp;

Despite those differences, Poland has stepped up for their neighbors in a glorious fashion. Not just the military aid (which has been very large, and extremely important), but also economically, humanitarian and extended to a welcome of Ukrainian refugeees inside their own borders that is massive.

&nbsp;

I choose to see that not just as an acknowledgement that if we let Russia roll over Ukraine, they'll be on Poland's border next. Because Poland **has** a NATO guarantee. I choose to see it as the Polish setting whatever differences they may or may not have with Ukraine completely aside in face of what they percieve as an unjust attack by Russia on another free nation. That we can *not* allow another Hitler to rise.

&nbsp;

It tells you a lot about the Polish character. And then you can start looking at all the others who are pushing hard for Ukraine. Just a few examples here; Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria. Plenty of old schisms there too. 

&nbsp;

It gives you a little more faith in the good of man. And it leads to something better in the future. How much stronger arent we all when we stand together. How much better doesnt it feel to help than to hinder. 

&nbsp;

Even economically...down the line, every single one of the countries I mentioned are going to benefit. It definetly hurts them economically now, but once Ukraine *does* gain their free future, Europe as a whole will experience a significant economic boost.

&nbsp;

Proud of you Poland. This is the character and strenght that made me fall in love with Poland many years ago. I see the same qualities in many of the countries around you now as well.",1676334376.0,1676333501.0,t3_110yv98,t1_j8fipq5,,1,43,0,43,0,0,

Our “opposition “ doesn’t deserve to be called so. It’s a bunch of thieves who took part in the theft of a billion dollars some years ago. Then their “leaders “ fled the country.

This year they started financing some protests.

People who took part in these protests are PAID, they are from poor families, a lot of them are alcoholics. 

They were paid decent money, more than they would make working in the fields.

I know this sounds like typical government propaganda, but it’s true.

So don’t believe a single word this “opposition” says and don’t buy into their “protests”. They don’t even have a political agenda, they just want to get back in power to keep stealing.

At the same time, people who took part in these protests are basically NPCs - they have no clue what they're protesting (against, or in support), they are there just to get their 10$ per day (while bigger fishes made up to 1,000$ per day - recruiters).

You can check out this video and look at their faces. When asked Why are they protesting, their answer vary from ""Against America to against Zelensky"".. da fuq that has to do with us?

That kind of gave his few movie hits a good fight choreography, sense of realism.

Everyone in the world can see that they are seriously underperforming and even getting kicked in the teeth on occasion.  There are basically two options - they are quietly pulling diplomatic strings while pretending like they are still in the fight, or the leadership is ignorant to the reality on the ground.  
  
I find both of these things hard to believe.  Though I will say that the second one seems more likely with EXTRAWIDE Kadyrov apparently sniffing around the Kremlin more and more.  Almost like he's controlled opposition positioning himself to catch that falling knife if needed.  But if Russian history says anything, it's that this ends with an involuntary transition of power.  
  
My prediction - in early summer or fall Putin will either quietly flee the country or ""die"" of his illness. Medvedev will assume interim leadership, and fall on the sword while declaring victory and overseeing the drawdown.  He will then go into exile in Argentina or China or drown himself in a bathtub of boiling lard ahead of the 2024 elections.  Prigozhin, Kadyrov and Girkin and a handful of other contenders will duke it out, and the election will probably be decided in a backroom deal to negotiate the next decade of power sharing among Oligarchs.

I agree and add I believe they will also double down on a culture of lying, corruption, and manipulation. Russian leaders are openly committing crimes against their people and the rest of the world. There is no way a legitimate government can excuse this to its people. So they will be *required* to continue to tell ever more outrageous lies and severely curtail freedom of speech to retain their grip on power. Since Russia will be further isolated and cutoff from the rest of the world, there will be little to *no incentive* to have their internal stories comport with external (objective) reality.

Being able to fire artillery at a supply route does not mean that ""both access routes Ukraine had used had been destroyed in the last day"" as you said. If true it means that the Russians can fire artillery at it, that is far from ideal but it by no means blocks or destroys your supply routes. Makes it more dangerous to rotate troops and bring supplies sure, maybe even combined with other issues could be a factor in an eventual withdraw. But artillery is not great at all for hitting vehicles on the move, in fact hitting a moving vehicle would be an unbelievably lucky shot.

Also they banned journalists from Bakhumt a couple days ago, who are these ""soldiers involved in the fight"" that CNN talked too? How did they make these observations themselves that they claimed too? Who are the Ukrainian military sources?

The only way you could count those supply routes as blocked is if Russia had a direct line of sight to them and could hit them with ATGM's or other direct fire weapons that would be capable of hitting a moving target, but they don't say that they say Russian artillery has blocked it. I doubt this piece of news because saying a road is blocked by artillery doesn't make any sense.

3. Ukraine has very good artillery. And they're getting more. They are more accurate than Russian guns. And their target identification is better.

4. Russia is running out of weapons.

5. Ukrainian soldiers are currently training with NATO militaries in Germany on how to fight a mechanized battle as a combined warfare unit. Y'know that thing the Russians fail completely at. When this is done in a month they'll conduct an offensive to liberate the rest of their country. MBTs are just one part of a combined arms operation, the IFVs that can keep the infantry moving along with the tanks will be invaluable since tanks can't operate without infantry guarding them. 

6. Putin is a very sick little troll that sees Russians as little more than the serfs their great-great-grandparents were. He wants to be a knew tsar and take all the wealth of Russia for himself and his cronies. He will fail.",1676338208.0,1676337614.0,t3_110yv98,t1_j8fy35b,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

2. The T72’s and BMP’s had differing radios, with the BMPs using 2.5-3km range unencrypted radios (these had been brought out of storage, when the 155th started the war they were in modern BMP-4’s I want to say but since they have now been “reconstituted” twice now the gear is all over the place.

3. Different formations - artillery, assault group, command - were literally too far away to talk to each other, even if doctrine allowed for these elements to do so, due to their lack of appropriate comms

Resignation is (mainly) a PR move (not in a negative meaning), but there's more to it.  
   
The PM which resigned had a lot of communication fails, the majority of the people disapproved her.   
They were probably planning replacing her for a long time, as well as some other ministers.

There was also an internal struggle in the governing party, there were two factions, one affiliated with our president, and another with a minister, but no details about what were the differences.  


In the end, the party affiliated with president won, and the new PM is supposed to be her close ally.  


The new PM also was a minister of internal affairs years ago, and his main goal will be working on country's security. So the timing was probably influenced by some information that Zelensky provided to our president (about russia's coup plan).  


About prospects - not sure, I hope we will stay on pro-EU course, the chances are slim, as the current government is the most pro-EU we can get, and they are struggling with a ton of issues and chances of them getting re-elected are slim, but if they work hard, they can do it.

Hi! You replied to my reply, which means you are not a bot and probably not a troll. I've got a little more time now to write out my thoughts, so let me elaborate a little.
What sets alarm bells off (with me at least, but I wager with a lot of other people as well), is the 'meta criticism'  and pre-emptively responding to negative responses. It's something we see a lot from actual trolls and bots.

 The second thing is the suggestive question that was your first line.  Stuff like  'Aren't you all concerned?' And 'did you hear about [misinformation point]?' Are standard lingo for trolls.

I'm sure good news is appreciated more here than bad news, but the latter is not inherently unacceptable to post here as far as I know. It's just the way you frame it. If you want to share your exact source without sounding like a troll, you could do something like this:
