This was translated via chrome btw.

Well, I have something to tell, today wehave the first day of mobilization in Irkutsk, earlier I was in the Irkutskregion.Just about my personal experience. They called on Friday from the militaryregistration and enlistment office, they invited me for September 26 today. Shortlyabout myself.

 The oath was in 2001 after the military department. There were no fees, 10 shots from amachine gun before the oath and the MO ran out of money, there were no mortarfirings. Ok, the rank of lieutenant received. Until 2019, they didn’tremember me, then they invited me to the training camp, but already taking intoaccount the civilian specialty in IT.

 They took several people, the rest arefree, I am among those not in demand. Just before that, pink mobilizationinstructions were pasted in, in which they indicated the second one after themain VUS, closer to civilian experience. And now, in fact, they are rowingeveryone who came. You are 60 years old, but you have the necessary VUSperfectly, you suit us. The exceptions are over 65 years old andwith many children, it was a couple of people who let them go. 

The rest ofthe agenda on receipt and documents to receive a one-time monetary allowancefrom the governor. They themselves are not interested inany conversations, attempts to find out what they have been doing for the last21 years, even the mobilization order from 2019. VUS is suitable, age isnot older than 65, the rest is not important to them. There are not manypeople in the accounting table of officers. Ordinary significantly more.

 Perhaps the excesses of the first dayand then will be more clear. Departure in an unknown direction on the29th, there are a couple of days to pack. So it turns out that myexperience in IT over the past 20 years has not given up at all. 

And the fact that over the same 20years I have safely forgotten everything that was taught at the militarydepartment, that I simply do not have the skills to adjust fire, I am not ableto tie a battery on the ground, I don’t know the charter of guard duty, I amnot able to teach subordinates,PS They don't look at any papers,characteristics, letters from employers, they just pick them up and give themwithout reading, referring to the new instructions. Booking only. 

There is nomedical examination at the military registration and enlistment office.  


Edit: So get this straight he had some training in 2001, shot a couple of times with a machine gun untill they ran out of ammo and was promoted to Lt. and discharged and 20 years years hey look a Lt. on paper he will be great commander.

>Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko. **Both countries are ready to cooperate with the West ""if they treat us with respect,"" Putin said** at the unannounced talks in Sochi on the Black Sea. **Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu said Putin made clear to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Russia was ready to negotiate with Ukraine.** However, **Putin had set new conditions for a cease-fire during talks** with Erdogan last week in Uzbekistan. Cavusoglu did not elaborate on these conditions.

Compare to Georgia's

It was another quiet day with no shelling or missile strikes aimed at the city, but they did fire a lot of missiles at other places.

Apparently we didn’t actually receive the NASAMS batteries yet, which was a bit of a letdown, because everyone here is waiting for more air defenses.

This is a common pattern, longtime daily users clashing with newer users asking questions. Happens in pretty much every forum, you even see it on stackoverflow and stuff. Any community focused around a specific subject usually ends up this way. 

New users are often bad at googling and/or research, old users are way way too saturated on the content and overestimate other people's knowledge on the subject.  The old users have seen the same content ten thousand times, the new users are asking questions about things that are the main, basic issues that are central to the discussion. 

This is also a problem that can't be solved by banning anyone or removing their content, so Reddit mods can't do shit. One of the only wise things 4chan has ever done was the whole ""lurk moar"" thing, which addressed this problem, but the prerequisite of that is having everyone be an asshole and we don't want that. 

Specifically, what's happening in this thread, is CNN's national show, and all sorts of news apps such as the BBC or Google News or Apple news or Snapchat, have been serving nuclear terror related content, which is causing less informed users to ask anxious questions. Nobody in here is intentionally fearmongering, CNN is though, and some other publications.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 26 September 2022


- The initial tranches of men called up under Russia's partial mobilisation have started arriving at military bases. Many tens of thousands of call-up papers have already been issued. Russia will now face an administrative and logistical challenge to provide training for the troops.

- Unlike most Western armies, the Russian military provides low-level, initial training to soldiers within their designated operational units, rather than in dedicated training establishments. Typically, one battalion within each Russian brigade will remain in garrison if the other two deploy and can provide a cadre of instructors to train new recruits or augmentees. However, Russia has deployed many of these third battalions to Ukraine.

- Many of the drafted troops will not have had any military experience for some years. The lack of military trainers, and the haste with which Russia has started the mobilisation, suggests that many of the drafted troops will deploy to the front line with minimal relevant preparation. They are likely to suffer a high attrition rate.",False,1664172317.0,t3_xo8j80,t3_xo8j80,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

**Why do many analysts think Nuke use is extremely unlikely?**

Firstly, what does their use achieve in a risk/reward context?

Rewards - widescale destruction

Risks - escalation to the point of losing (ramped up US response or MAD), ostracisation by CCP/India, radiation issues.

Russia can and has already achieved widescale destruction with conventional weapons, so there isn't much in the way of a reward but there are many risks.

Another, often overlooked fact is what are Putins priorities? What does he value most?

Most likely, he values being in power. While there are many other priorities, like Russian victory, etc, him staying in power is most likely to be number 1.

And a decision to use Nukes would appear even weaker than mobilisation, achieves almost nothing and risks everything.

Thus it's extremely unlikely.

Putin has made many poor decisions based on poor information but on this issue things are more clear as there is a long period of precedent.

Even a loss in Ukraine is easier to handle than the alternative. In the last 70 years there are many examples of strong, nuclear armed nations losing conventional conflicts and packing up and going home, without resorting to Nukes.

This war is far from over, but all indications are that this is just sabre rattling by Russia and there aren't any indications that using Nukes would change things in Russia's favour.",1664238633.0,1664237948.0,t3_xo8j80,t3_xo8j80,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

There is speculation that this may be a war not only based on existential national identity (Ukraine is Russia and should be anything other than ours) but with a cynical sub motive of mining all that sweet rare earth metal for capital gain. 

I mean - money makes the world go round. I wouldn’t put it past putin to have really done this for the chance to become one of the worlds leading suppliers of rare earth metals. Let’s face it. Carbon fuel is not going to be the soup du jour forever: maybe this plays a larger role than we are considering?

CSTO being at war with each other is one thing but can be seen as ""internal conflicts"". So I wouldn't be surprised if Putin still believe he can invoke his CSTO colleague to fight against a ""bigger enemy"". But I also believe nobody will answer the call.

But looking how CSTO, the NATO alternative, being competely useless at what it is designed for has to be a massive defeat for Russia on the geopolitical landscape.

There's a good chance that the reason ATACMS has been withheld is because it is being used as Ukraine's equivalent of nuclear retaliation. It's even possible that some HIMARS have this munition already loaded and are waiting, pointing at Moscow for the event of Russia using a tactical nuclear bomb in Ukraine.

It's obvious that the US can't give nuclear weapons to Ukraine and it's highly unlikely that the US would retaliate in Ukraine's stead as it would drag them into the conflict and risk being attacked themselves.

Thus, ATACMS might be an effective way of setting up a pseudo MAD situation in which Ukraine would immediately retaliate with precision strikes in Moscow. Such a scenario would fall short of an uncontrolled nuclear escalation, would avoid having other countries dragged into the war and would even be seen positively in the west since HIMARS is precise enough to flatten the Kremlin but avoid massive civilian casualties.

I could very well imagine that any back-channel talks be used to remind Russia that ATACMS might already be present in Ukraine and that a pre-established protocol would immediately retaliate against Moscow with the important detail that S-400 air defense has proven to be defective against HIMARS.",False,1664206710.0,t3_xo8j80,t3_xo8j80,,0,-24,0,-24,0,0,

>Almost all militaries (except Israel) have been far too slow to take the threat of loitering munitions (and especially small UAS) seriously. But, against simple, cheap types that can swarm there are many routes to countering them, from SHORAD, to EW systems and MANPADS. 

>Physics still applies, and anything small and cheap enough to expend in great numbers can either go fast or far but not both, and payload will be small. If you add multi-mode seekers, advanced navigation, stealth and EW resistance, costs will be like other modern missiles

This is what I've been saying.

They're propeller cruise missiles that are lucky to hit 100mph in level flight. 

Russia tried using them against the conventional military in the north and got shotdown. 

They tried against frontline cities during the day and got them shotdown by MANPADS. 

They found a hole in Ukraine's defenses in rear cities at night because apparently the TDF don't have NV/IR optics and hit a munitions warehouse. 

Ukraine needs more night fighting equipment and more MANPADS, not chicken littles claiming this is a game changer and spreading Iranian/Russian propaganda.",False,1664219808.0,t3_xo8j80,t1_iq02f7b,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

Never underestimate the power of an idea to move some immovable object and definitely do not underestimate the capacity of ideas to hinder, bolster, react with, and destroy *other ideas*.

It's easy to hand-wave this away as ""it's just for domestic consumption"" but never mind that. Now the idea of a ""referendum"" is tainted. Now whenever anyone tries to organize a referendum about anything in the future with a result unfavorable to Russia, they have their troll farms spam ""in 2022 the USA refused to recognize the referendum Russia organized, referendums are bullshit and no one is obligated to respect the results"". Not only is Russia's official stance regarding the territories in question changed from ""we're capturing Ukraine"" to ""we're defending our own land"", but everyone knows this has happened, and everyone knows that everyone knows, etc etc etc etc ad infinitum. Now you have strange emergent properties like people discussing the possibility of an imminent nuclear holocaust in this very forum, while others respond in confusion, ""why are we talking about this now? What bullshit magic has caused this divergence in the narrative? *Nothing has changed*"". Have you heard of the blue-eyed islander puzzle? In matters like these, sometimes a simple sentence that changes nothing can change everything. 

I am trying to convey to you the actual phenomenon that people half-jokingly refer to when they talk about ""8D chess"". This is what the Russians are doing, trying an 8D chess maneuver to pivot to their favored timeline where in 50 years the glorious USSR is restored, the USA is broken up into dozens of warring states, and Europe finally knows its place. If you need a dose of copium to deal with this, don't look at the chess move one-dimensionally and say ""I don't see how this changes anything"" because then you are just deluding yourself. Instead look carefully at how the West responds. For instance, look at all these preemptive declarations by nations saying that they will not recognize the result of the referendum. What did *they* change? Well, one-dimensionally, nothing; they just said out loud what it was clear they were going to do anyway. But eight-dimensionally they blunt Russia's moment of triumph when the ""results"" are in, and like I said above, a moment of triumph is an idea and don't ever underestimate an idea. The thing is, *two can play that game*. Try to write a story where you are winning and coerce reality into your preferred timeline via 8D chess, and your opponent will respond in kind.

He's saying it's naive to imagine that Russian can simply ""lose"" or ""be beaten."" The idea that there will be some point at which Russia simply packs it in, admits they've lost, and goes home after shaking hands is facile and childish.

He's admonishing the west's proclivity to view complex conflicts (no I don't support the war because I said ""complex conflict,"" thank you for proving the point), as win-or-lose, black-and-white narratives.

His directive to attempt to see the perspective of the Russians, however warped those perspectives might be, is precisely as valuable as all the many, many pieces of media and academic investigation into the thought processes, delusions, principles, etc., of, e.g, the Nazis. None of those investigations explicitly or de facto implicate the investigator, artist, academic, etc. as a Nazi-supporter or -sympathizer. To claim as much would be, again, idiotic.

Ignorantly proclaiming that everyone on the other side is ""wrong,"" that we are just going to ""win"" and ""crush"" them, and that somehow this will result in a net-positive outcome for all parties is asinine, childish, and representative of the kind of thinking endemic to this platform.

Interestingly, his position is materially comparable to Chomsky's, who couldn't be more left. People on this sub are able to perform the mental gymnastics, though, of presenting their positions as diametrically opposed manifestations of parallel political parties, whilst misreading and condemning both without ever actually grasping any part of the point. 

To reiterate, his point is that Russia will not ""lose,"" because conflicts as complex as this do not *ever* have, simply, ""winners"" and ""losers.""

All else about the jobs is equal: what you do, career prospects, corporate culture, etc. Do you need to think about what to choose if you get two offers—one from the company offering 100% more in your city and the other from the company offering 100% far from it? No, you don't, because the decision is obvious. You only need to think of what to decide if you receive the low offer in your city and the high offer far from it because there is a trade-off involved. If Russia just sends the untrained conscripts onto the battlefield, they will die quickly, not halt any advance (multiple untrained soldiers with rusty AK-47s cannot stop a single tank), and the remaining will either mutiny or die anyway.

They have little ability to launch a well planned attack that has a chance of success because they've never been trained how to execute a well planned attack. They can sit in a trench and shoot at anything they see move but when they have no idea how to work as a team or a good leader to lead them they're not going to be winning Russia the war.

Adding more troops into Ukraine means they also need to be supplied, Russia has had trouble supplying the numbers they do have. It is not unreasonable to assume that they couldn't support anywhere close to 1.2 million more troops even if they wanted too. Then they also don't seem to have the ability to supply decent equipment to those already there either. Flak jackets from decades ago that have no chance of stopping a round from an assault rifle. Helmets that a bend like a tin can, many don't even have proper uniforms. And some of the firearms look like their next stop should be in a museum, not at the front lines of the war.

Then Russia has also sent many of their trainers to fight in Ukraine after their plans to have a 3 day war didn't work out so well, many of those are now dead. As are many experienced officers that needed to be on the front lines because their unmotivated troops wouldn't attack otherwise. Those loses have seriously damaged Russia's ability to train new troops, what few good leaders and trainers they had have suffered heavy attrition.

Even if they actually spend the time to train some of these new recruits what is the quality of the training going to be when you've lost so many of your instructors and best officers?

All that is why most analysts don't see how the Russian army can possibly equip and train even 300,000 troops reasonably well in the short or even longer term. They don't have the trainers, they don't have the equipment and they don't have good leadership, those problems could take *years* to fix. Ukraine isn't going to give Russia that time. Yes adding in warm bodies to the front lines makes it harder for Ukraine to reclaim their land and it will cost them more lives but what Russia is adding is in no way equal to the caliber of most of the Ukrainian troops they are facing.

All those Russian draftees most likely prolong the war but unless we see a complete turnaround in competence and logistics by the Russians they still won't win them the war and if Russia was capable of fixing those things they would have done so already.

You have keep in mind that the Dutch defence budget (and in term ""stuff to send"") has been gutted for years ... even decades. Up until '68 the Dutch had an aircraft carrier for example. Since the 60's, Dutch defence spending dropped from 4.09 % gdp to 1.13 % in 2015. In June the Dutch ramped up a tiny bit to meet the required 2% NATO standard by 2025. But it takes time to build up supplies and forces. They are sending whatever they can.

>
The Dutch armed forces lost the bulk of their heavy equipment in two rounds of cuts, one after the Cold War and another during the Great Recession.
>
The Netherlands used to have more than 900 tanks. It sold all but eighteen, and they are part of a joint Dutch-German tank battalion.
>
At its peak, the Netherlands operated 213 F-16 fighter jets. 68 remain, and they are being phased out in favor of the F-35. Because the new jet is more expensive, the Netherlands is buyer fewer.
>
Three out of four artillery brigades have been cut. The Dutch Navy sold eight of its sixteen frigates.
>
The lack of matériel is so dire that the military admits it can no longer defend Dutch territory, including in the Caribbean. More out of necessity than by choice, it has specialized in peacekeeping, but after taxing operations in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan it can barely manage those anymore either. The Dutch Court of Auditors reported in 2018 that soldiers deployed to Mali had to “improvise” to make up for lack of equipment.

 >The Dagestan War (Russian: Дагестанская война), also known as the Invasion of Militants in Dagestan (Russian: Вторжение боевиков в Дагестан) began when the Chechnya-based Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB), an Islamist group, led by  Shamil Basayev, Ibn al-Khattab, Ramzan Akhmadov and Arbi Barayev, invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, on 7 August 1999, in support of the Shura of Dagestan separatist rebels. The war ended with a major victory for the Russian Federation and Dagestan Republic, and the retreat of the IIPB.
 
**[Second Chechen War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War)** 
 
 >The Second Chechen War (Russian: Втора́я чече́нская война́, Chechen: ШолгIа оьрсийн-нохчийн тӀом, lit. 'Second Russian-Chechen War') took place in Chechnya and the border regions of the North Caucasus between the Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, from August 1999 to April 2009. In August 1999, Islamist fighters from Chechnya infiltrated Russia's Dagestan region, declaring it an independent state and calling for holy war.

Russia's logistical problems should not apply to inside its borders where it has everythung connected by railways and being outright invaded could change the population's current refusal to enlist into mass support like WW2 where now an army of 20 million Russians is not impossible.

NATO would be the one facing the hostile population rather than being helped like the Ukranian Army is being helped by the locals. And the logistic situation would become increasingly worse the further you go inside this continent sized nation.

Certainly unkind and racist without a doubt, but in saying that, while people might complain about them, I don't think many except the ethnofascists would consider them as subhuman or deserving of lesser treatment.

In the russian opposition telegram channels I follow, Russians are cheering for Dagestani people and calling for the rest of Russians in Petersburg and Moscow to take a page out of their book. I've even seen some say that they are doing more to defend the freedom of Russians than Russians are. So it's a mixed bag.

The US, the UK, the entirety of NATO, all of them are on record saying ""if we feel like we're under an existential threat, the continuity of government is 
 borders have been significantly breached, tactical nukes are on the table."" Russia has the same policy of course. 

This particular situation is a bit iffy because 

1) Ukraine isn't under a nuclear umbrella

2) Russia could feel like it's under an continuation of government crisis or something if Ukraine attacks towards Moscow, with air power or whatever. The Soviet policy was literally ""if a warplane is spotted flying towards Moscow, we will retaliate with nukes immediately""

3) Russia sees Ukrainian deaths as a bonus, not a hindrance. 

So with this scenario, I could see Putin ordering the use of a tactical nuke to hit a UAAF airfield, or a particularly annoying ground unit. 

But, despite what all the militaries say, there is no practical difference between a tactical nuke and a strategic one. 

NATO and the US are taking these concepts seriously. They have dragged their feet on getting UA long range weapons that could hit far into Russia, and also they haven't even mentioned the idea of putting Ukraine under the NATO nuclear umbrella.

>Although Russia suffered a number of defeats, Emperor Nicholas II remained convinced that Russia could still win if it fought on; he chose to remain engaged in the war and await the outcomes of key naval battles. As hope of victory dissipated, he continued the war to preserve the dignity of Russia by averting a ""humiliating peace."" Russia ignored Japan's willingness early on to agree to an armistice and rejected the idea of bringing the dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.

...
>Military leaders and senior tsarist officials agreed before the war that Russia was a much stronger nation and had little to fear from the Empire of Japan. The fanatical zeal of the Japanese infantrymen astonished the Russians, who were dismayed by the apathy, backwardness, and defeatism of their own soldiers.[80] The defeats of the Army and Navy shook Russian confidence. 

...
>The empire was certainly capable of sending more troops but this would make little difference in the outcome due to the poor state of the economy, the embarrassing defeats of the Russian Army and Navy by the Japanese, and the relative unimportance to Russia of the disputed land made the war extremely unpopular.

Other than the 2 generic books of very generic anyone can come up with ""rules"" of religious overtones he's mostly known for, 20 years ago, and a few published papers, he took a drastic change not in the last few years, but after 2000.

Constant complaints he was outright lying about majority consensus in psychological community, misquoted or quote mining papers to say they say something they don't, and constant others and other psychologists constantly for 2 decades having to come out calling all this behavior out.

The real reason he rose to fame is his arguments were palatable bigotry. They were the same arguments every other bigot would say, he just had a way with words and mostly the right ring glued themselves to him because the outright bigoted statements weren't working. But the soft ""empathetic"" approach arguments were still working. The messages were the same, one just sounded less bad on the surface.

So he rose to fame giving bigots a way to justify, and a fallacy of authority and better arguments for the bigots to feel they are justified or look better.

His only real claim to an actual good message was freedom of speech, but even then he knew freedom of speech had limits from the moment it was created, he just didn't like that racism and sexism was beginning to be banned in public forums more often. Which to be fair, can be concerning and needs to be balanced.

People often bring up his stance on cancel culture as something good, but he ignores the decades of right wing cancel culture, satanic panic, banning books, banning people, banning Harry Potter, banning pokemon, trying to censor evolution, firing people for personal beliefs etc etc etc.

All that was fine to him, he is upset the tides turned and the left was ""canceling"" people for bigotry and outright racism. Again, a nuanced conversation can be had on limits, but the reason he was fighting against ""cancel culture"" isn't because he's against it, he was for it in the past for moral reason, because the canceling agreed with his beliefs. When the shoe is on the other foot, suddenly it's bad. Essentially both his freedom of speech and cancel cultural critiques boil down to hypocrisy. While again, this isn't me saying they had no substance or worthwhile debate, there is debate and nuance and limits to be discussed and had, and unintentional consequences.

At the beginning most people were of this view in that Ukraine and western democracies will need to give Putin an off ramp or a win. The likely ""win"" for Putin was Ukraine conceding the annexation of some of its territories. But a combination of Ukraine's bravery and effectiveness and the west's resolve has dramatically changed the calculus.

Of course Russia won't lose in that no one wants a single square inch of its territories. As Zelensky famously said “If Ukraine loses, Ukraine ceases to exist. If Russia loses, we have a completely different Russia.”

But we've got more information now.

Putin is acting 'rationally' and has done so for a long time but the information he's been getting is garbage.

Garbage in, garbage out.

Each decision of his that I've dug deeper on, makes sense if you understand the information he's getting.

Mobilisation is a good example. Putin relies on support from ethno-nationalist circles and relies on a large share of the rest of the population not caring.

In those circles, he was losing support and losing the war as well. If you think about it from his perspective, a 'partial' mobilisation plays to his supporters while not going full scale to piss off the rest of Russia too much. He probably figures with his stranglehold on the security services he can keep discontent suppressed.

With Nukes, it's a whole different ball game and is lose-lose for him remaining in power and will likely lead to a military intervention by the Allies, which would accelerate Russia's military loss in Ukraine.

 >Banana equivalent dose (BED) is an informal unit of measurement of ionizing radiation exposure, intended as a general educational example to compare a dose of radioactivity to the dose one is exposed to by eating one average-sized banana. Bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), one of several naturally occurring isotopes of potassium. One BED is often correlated to 10−7 sievert (0. 1 μSv); however, in practice, this dose is not cumulative, as the potassium in foods is excreted in urine to maintain homeostasis.

The Office, originally named Office for Free Elections, was created in 1990 by the Charter of Paris and established in 1991. The name of the office was changed in 1992 to reflect the broadened mandate it received at the 1992 Helsinki Summit. Based in Warsaw, Poland, ODIHR is active throughout the 57 participating States of the OSCE.

William Gibson once said that what he found fascinating about post-Soviet Russia is that, much like the worlds in his cyberpunk novels, it was a society stratified between the upper and lower classes with no middle in between. (So basically the same direction the US is currently headed in terms of wealth disparity. Which is certainly an encouraging thought.) I don't know how true that is, given that those big lines of cars at the border have to come from somewhere. But the similarity between the oligarchs and the old aristocracy is pretty striking.

'Japanese-Russian War'; Russian: Ру́сско-япóнская войнá, romanized: Rússko-yapónskaya voyná) was fought between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire during 1904 and 1905 over rival imperial ambitions in Manchuria and the Korean Empire. The major theatres of military operations were located in Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden in Southern Manchuria, and the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. Russia sought a warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean both for its navy and for maritime trade.

We have written copies of inspirational speeches given by generals persuading the irregulars to reload once and fire the second shot before retreating from the British army.  That worked. Though it took 11 years and French intervention so not great. 

Even in the civil war union soldiers were issued cartridge boxes.  They would get in there and empty their boxes.  Dumping your box on the ground was dishonorable.  The enemy had to be within range before you were supposed to start blazing away.  Same/similar in the Napoleonic wars. The panic works in favor of the commander.  The infantry load muskets as fast as they can.  By the time everyone can shoot 20 musket rounds the field is a bloody mess.  Othere units decide the rest of the battle.  The survivors should have needed to regroup and refill their boxes anyway.   

Mortars can be fired very quickly.  What i am suggesting is not ""winning a war"".  Each cycle of retreat surrenders another belt of trenches.  It only ends well if real soldiers attack and recover or gain ground someplace else.  They would also have real soldiers fighting in tbe trenches.  Conscripts with mortars are two (at least) rows back in the trench belt.  

It gets ugly with Ukraine using counter battery radar and howitzers.  However, that means Ukraine's howitzers are not shooting at other targets.  The term ""cannon fodder"" applies here.

3cd44aa13c964aba768554d1c7797f98,xo8j80,iq1fivs,"Empires often have similar relationships with their subject people around violent wealth extraction.   During the imperial period they often create a narrow domestic elite that assists them in the violent resource extraction.  Often times when the empire retreats, the people that are left in charge are the collabarationist elite and they set up a form of government that we today would describe as kleptocracy.  ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.  But he speaks our language and celebrates our holidays!""

This process is often refered to as post-colonial governance where the domestic elites suck personal wealth in the exact same way the empire stole wealth.  It's basically the explanation for most bad African, W. Hemisphere, and S. E. Asian governments.

So, now we get into the specific example.  Russia and Ukraine sit on the edge of the great Eurasian plane or Steppe.  Before 1200 AD the region of roughly interconected river systems (Volga, Don, Dnieper, etc.) were governed by a Slavicized Viking Elite known as the Kyvian Rus.  The first city where the Vikings settled being Kyiv which was a portage point on the Dnieper River from where they could regulate Viking traders and raiders as well as the local slavic peoples.  After deaths and inheritance partitions the Kyvian Rus broke into a group of culturally and religiously related city states: Kyiv, Minsk, Smolensk, and Novgorod (destroyed but apx. St. Petersburg).

Then in the 1200s the Mongols invaded led by Genghis Khan creating the largest land empire in human history.  At their height the Mongols under Genghis's grand son Kublai Khan rulled all of modern China, Modern Russia, and much of the Middle East.  The successor states created from split inheritances would be great powers in Asia until the fall of the Mughals to the British Raj in the 1800s.

The Mongols, like most empires, elevated local elites to do their value/resource extraction.  On the border of the Eurasian Steppe and the northern Taiga, they chose a minor noble family from the Rus city states to be their tax collectors and local enforcers.  These nobles governed a polity known as ""The Grand Duchy of Muskovy"" from their capital in the minor Rus city of Moscow.

The Grand Duchy of Muskovy skimmed part of the Mongolian taxes to build up their wealth and military power.  And one by one, conquered each of the other Rus city states until the Grand Duchy of Muskovy led by Ivan IV ""the Terrible"" governed much of modern day northern Russia.  Excepting primarily the powerful city state of Novogorod, and the mongol succesor state of Kazan, to whom they still paid a regular tribute.  In the mid 1500's in quick succesion Muskovy conquered their former imperial overlords in Kazan and razed Novgorod to the ground (Novgorod being the most powerful Rus state up to that point as an independent, non Mongol conquered, city state tied into the European trading system).

Then the Tsars of Muskovy had full control of the imperial wealth system which they built for the Mongols and spent the next 150 years reverse conquering the Mongol Empire from which they sprang.  But their governance was the same small elite resrource extraction system from when they were Mongol tax collectors.  They were the post-colonial local government of the former Mongol Empire.

And they continued like that until overthrown by the Soviets.  Who, knew quite clearly what the Tsars were which is why their their rhetoric focused so much on anti-colonial language and action.  But, by the time of Stalin, they had recreated a narrow kleptocratic elite.  Which lasted until the collapse of the USSR, when the Russian Federation was briefly an incomplete democracy before being seized by a narrow kleptocratic elite.

They've been stuck in the post colonial governance ever since Ivan IV conqured Kazan and ended the tributes to the Mongols and Tartars in 1550, but retained the rest of the imperial extraction system from which their wealth and power derived.

The libs and the conservatives were against it. I mean the troubling part is that it would be actually illegal to send him to the USA as long as there would be even the remote possibility of a death sentence.

*said that Snowden will not be tortured, because “torture is unlawful in the United States.”*  which is ironic given the reality of gitmo.

Furthermore the last admin was sorta.. unpredictable with Trump going on record saying that he could pardon Snowden after earlier comments that teh US should execute Snowden...

In short, he views himself not as a chess player, but as a poker player... but what if you removed psychology from the picture entirely? 

As a pure thought exercise, imagine the implementation of a fully-automatic deadhand-like system that is configured to monitor all Ukrainian territory for the signs of a nuclear explosion, based on radiological, seismic, pressure, and flash sensors. This system would be configured to immediately, and without human input, order the launch of every US strategic nuclear weapon at Russia if such a detonation were detected. 

This system's capabilities and triggers would be advertised to Putin and all of Russia. Repeatedly, and through any and all means that would get their attention. The intention would be to make clear to Putin that there is no longer ""escalation"" in the sense that he's familiar and comfortable with, and that he won't be able to ""play poker"" with what is basically an automatic binary switch.

So that is not speculation. Additionally, we know that the US does not wat nuclear escalation, again by their own words.

Hence the reasoning on my side: while Putin may be backed into a corner with feeling he has nothing to lose, that does not apply to the entire Russian elite. Keeping them *all* informed on the American plans of confirmed non-nuclear but powerful retribution, is a sound move.

I see nothing to suggest that's not what Putin is attempting to do here, throwing bodies at the problem, playing for time, so that in six months or so, once he has a large number of trained troops, he can renew the offensive.  Sure, it might fail.  It might be futile.  However, the question is whether or not Putin thinks that it might be successful, not whether or not it will actually be successful.

Remember, anybody who tells Putin bad news gets shoved out of a window, and people generally like to live, so I doubt Putin is getting the most accurate information right now to make his decisions, especially about his officers' capability and his logistics, since the people responsible for informing him on those subjects are the same people who let it go to shit.  I'm sure those people like to live too, so given bad information as an input, there is a high likelihood of poor decisions as an output.

Russia is adding new military capabilities to its existing stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including those employable by ships, aircraft, and ground forces. These nuclear  warheads include theater- and tactical-range systems that Russia relies on to deter and defeat NATO or China in a conflict. Russia’s stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons \[is\] already large and diverse and is being modernized with an eye towards greater accuracy, longer ranges, and lower yields to suit their potential warfighting role. We assess   
Russia to have dozens of these systems already deployed or in development. **They include, but are not limited to: short- and close-range ballistic missiles, ground-launched cruise missiles, including the 9M729 missile,** which the U.S. Government determined violates the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces or INF Treaty, as well as antiship and antisubmarine missiles, torpedoes, and depth charges.

Correct. But the face of warfare has changed. Modern technologies and weaponry serve as significant force multipliers. A recent example would be the effect of MANPADS on the battlefield despite Russia's overwhelming numerical advantage in mechanized unit inventory. Throwing bodies at a problem until it corrects itself isn't a valid strategy in the ways that today's wars are fought. Russia is also under dire and unprecedented economic sanctions that worsen conditions with each passing day. Without western parts, they no longer have the capabilities to repair and mass produce new mechanized infantry, or to replace existing planes in their aging inventory. They've already resorted to using civilian vehicles to move between fronts.
