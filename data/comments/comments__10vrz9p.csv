>In the late Soviet era, only twice did Moscow’s military interrupt the daily lives of ordinary citizens. The first occasion was the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, which went largely unnoticed by many Russians because few knew what was happening. The second was the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, which had far greater consequences. For many people, the sight of zinc coffins being flown back from a distant southern country, even as Marxism-Leninism was losing currency at home, shattered the moral foundations of the Soviet project.
>
>In 2022, Moscow’s military once again interrupted the lives of ordinary citizens with an invasion, and the result has been even worse than either of those previous events: Russia has just lived through the most terrifying year in post-Soviet history. Yet despite the growing loss of life and stark moral defeats, there has been no shattering of national foundations. Russians are becoming divided, and their opinions are polarized as people grow tired of war. But far from weakening Putin’s hold on power, the “special military operation” has only strengthened it.
>
>Those who fear Putin have either fled the country or are silent. The regime has a formidable arsenal of instruments to deploy against anyone who speaks out or expresses opposition. It has used the legal system to crush dissent, handing down Stalinist prison terms to antiwar activists. It has invented its equivalent of yellow stars to harass, threaten, and intimidate those deemed “foreign agents.” (I was honored to receive such a designation in late December.) It has closed down or blocked access to virtually all independent media. And it has pinned the unofficial label of “national traitor” on anyone who does not express delight at the state’s ramping up of repression, the war, and the increasingly personal military-police-state regime that is driving it.

>Nearly a year since Russia’s invasion, the pace of demand for ammunition and explosives is turning into a test of Europe’s industrial production capacity in a race to re-arm.

>He estimates Ukraine has been firing an estimated 5,000-6,000 artillery rounds a day, which he said is similar to the annual orders of a smaller European state before the war.

>
>Some components are in such high demand, Brandtzæg said, that their delivery time has increased from months to years.
>
>It has led to a scramble to source materials, from chemicals for explosives to metals and plastics for fuses and artillery shell casings. Most companies have increased production shifts ahead of expected orders from national governments, and are hiring more people, another challenge since the start of the pandemic.

>	“I soon found out that the KGB’s infiltration of the church had gotten way out of hand. Many of our officers were abusing their power.  Numerous Russian Orthodox priests in Eastern Europe complained to me that KGB officers would drink the Communion wine, steal church property, and demand bribes or payments. A sizable number of the priests were homosexual, and one of the main ways the KGB recruited priests was by catching them in homosexual acts or relationships and then blackmailing them into working for the security services. Many KGB agents, both at home and abroad, looked on the priests with disdain and abused them whenever they got the chance. The priests, for their part, were disgusted that they had to dance to the tune of the boorish KGB officers.

>	“I can’t go on like this,” one priest told me in his church in East Berlin, referring to KGB officers boozing it up and extorting gifts from him. “It will put me in a ridiculous position if my parishioners ever learn about it. My reputation will be lost.”

>	There was little I could do to help the priests stationed overseas, for they had been recruited and were under the control of two notorious officers from the KGB’s Fifth Directorate—Romanov and Timoshevsky. For all practical purposes, they controlled the church, deciding who would rise in the church hierarchy, who would become a bishop, and, ultimately, who would be anointed Patriarch. I met Timoshevsky, a protégé of future KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov, only once, and he struck me as a typical representative of the old-school KGB. His and Romanov’s specialty was digging up incriminating evidence on priests and then using it to control them. They treated the priests and church leaders like marionettes, and Timoshevsky was deeply hated by many in the Russian Orthodox Church, though none dared[…]”

At this point I am half convinced that Russian air defenses cannot reliably target anything smaller than a Boeing 777.  More likely, this just shows how critical PGMs are when it come to air superiority and countering Russian AA doctrine which relies heavily on ""highly capable"" point defense systems instead of distributed IADS.  Also, how the US armed drone program seems specifically designed for this mission.  
  
A Pansir or Buk point defense system deployed with Russian BTGs has an engagement range of somewhere between 30-80mi depending on who you ask.  They are designed with high engagement ceilings (75,000ft) and very fast missiles (newer Pantsir missiles are close to hypersonic) to shoot at high altitude supersonic bombers dropping JDAMs and GBU-Paveways.  But an MQ9 loitering at 50,000 ft can sit back and sling glide munitions from nearly 100mi away.  Whoops.  
  
It's actually a bit fascinating watching the drone war in Ukraine and talking about ""the future"" of drone combat, when the US has been predicting this for decades now.  Yes the Reapers are conveniently good for blowing up ISIS weddings or assassinating Mullahs with sword missiles, or whatever, but it is also becoming clear that they are a game changer for CAS.

Soldats! Je suis content de toi. Le jour d'Austerlitz, vous avez répondu à toutes mes attentes de bravoure et d'audace ; vous avez orné vos aigles d'une gloire qui ne mourra jamais. En moins de quatre heures, une armée de cent mille hommes, commandée par les empereurs de Russie et d'Autriche, a été soit taillée en pièces, soit dispersée. Ceux qui ont échappé à votre acier se sont noyés dans les lacs. Quarante étendards, les étendards de la garde impériale russe, cent vingt canons, vingt généraux, plus de trente mille prisonniers… tels sont les résultats de cette journée de renommée éternelle. Cette infanterie tant vantée – et en fait plus nombreuse – n'a pas pu résister à votre assaut ; désormais vous n'avez plus de rivaux, plus personne à craindre. Voyez comment, en deux mois, cette troisième coalition a été battue et décousue ; la paix ne peut pas être loin. Mais, comme je l'ai promis à mon peuple avant de traverser le Rhin, je ne consentirai à une paix que si elle nous donne des garanties et assure la récompense de nos alliés.  
Soldats, lorsque le peuple français a placé sur ma tête la couronne impériale, je me suis confié à vous afin de garder toujours cette couronne dans ce haut état de gloire qui seul pouvait lui donner du prix pour moi. Pourtant, en même temps, nos ennemis cherchaient à le détruire et à le déshonorer ! Et ils ont voulu me forcer à placer cette couronne de fer – conquise par le sang de tant de Français – sur la tête d'un de nos plus cruels ennemis ! Ce sont là, en effet, des projets exorbitants et insensés que, le jour même de l'anniversaire du couronnement de votre empereur, vous avez annulés et confondus ! Vous leur avez appris qu'il est plus facile de nous défier et de nous menacer que de nous battre.  
Soldats, quand tout ce qui est nécessaire au bonheur et à la prospérité de notre patrie sera accompli, je vous ramènerai en France ; vous y serez l'objet de mes plus tendres attentions.

The most successful Russian offensive of the first world war was the Brusilov offensive, which was a combination of deception and pioneering combined arms tactics.

Russian wave tactics during the first world War failed to achieve most of their tactical or strategic objectives, and contributed heavily to the collapse of the Russian Empire.

The Soviets used human wave attacks against Finland with predictable results.

During the second world war, Soviet human wave tactics were more of a myth than most people believe. The Soviets used pincer attacks and urban combat with great effect, and eventually fell into a pattern of using artillery to soften up a target before advancing infantry and armored vehicles.

Democracies, even with their vast imperfections, are infinitely preferable to military dictatorships.

The sanctions didn't make logical sense to Putin who decided that if it's going to happen anyway then they may as well just ignore them and live with them.  

World leaders kept doing their foreign policy resets each new administration and in their blind arrogance they deluded themselves with the idea that they could do better and ignored the past, sweeping it under the rug.

Yes, there were some other factors involved this time, but it shouldn't surprise anyone that a dictator thought he could keep doing the same thing if he himself didn't consider the consequences he had previously faced to be that big of a problem.

Perhaps at the beginning of the war, but ever since November when the front stabilized, Russian logistics have been catching up.

So, your argument here is that Russia has an untapped manpower resource in millions of men, but that somehow doesn't matter unless we notice it?

Huh?

Perun's argument is that Russia has lots of resources available, such as manpower. Should Russia choose to use that manpower, then Ukraine cannot counter it with their own population.

It's very basic math. Russia has more people than Ukraine.

Anyways, Russia's so-called stealth mobilization is likely to continue unabated. They mobilized 500k last year, and are planning to bring their army up to 1.5 million by the end of the year.

> Russia does not have millions of untapped men. They have a mobilisation potential of a few million, but thats nowhere near having millions available

Your sentences here are logically inconsistent. You say that they can mobilize a ""few million"" but cannot mobilize ""millions.""

I think I'm comfortable agreeing with that. Company-sized sounds about right. But for context, Ukraine's attack at Balakliya was 5 whole brigades, and that was considered a relatively small force for a concerted offensive operation. The involvement of tanks does not by itself indicate that it's the primary axis of advance.

In the initial Donbass renewed offensive fighting of May 2022, Russia sent *two whole armored divisions* into Izyum alone, with the expectation that an entire armored division would be completely destroyed or exhausted in the initial taking of the town. This prediction proved correct. Russia had a second whole division lined up behind it, and that division eventually stalled to the southwest of Izyum after two more months of heavy fighting.

I do agree it's possible that Russia's command structure is degraded beyond hope at this point, but I still don't think that means we've seen the largest push.

Caucasus regions are a strong contender as they have low percentages of Russian population, and in many parts they follow Islam rather than Orthodox Christiantiy. Chechnya, Ingushetia, and Dagestan, for example. There's also the Circassian people who tend towards Islam in Circassia and Kabardino-Balkar, and the Orthodox Ossetians.

Parts of the Tatar region also share this Islamic predominance such as Tatarstan itself and Bashkortostan, and to a lesser extent Chuvashia.

Aside from that, the only other major contenders are Sakha in the east, and Tuva in the south next to Mongolia.

These Republics and regions that I've named are the only regions in Russia where the non-Russian ethnic group forms a majority of the population. 

Out of these regions, only Dagestan and Tuva share a border with another country, meaning any independence will either have to also annex other Russian regions by conquest or accept their existence as an enclave (which Russia could just blockade). Even if you think that a collapsed Russia will suddenly have zero capacity to resist enclave independence movements, you must accept that this already makes it a *very* different situation to 91, where every single SSR state that gained independence was able to immediately begin trading on the world market and form connections with other countries. 

But what about Tuva and Dagestan? Starting with Tuva, first of all, they are surprisingly where some of the most hard-core Z fascism has taken hold, the sad irony notwithstanding. The reasons for this may fill an entire academic article, and I'm not an expert on this, but I believe it's primarily due to the Russian army being the primary employer of this incredibly impoverished region. It ranks 75th out of 83 regions in Russia for GDP per capita, unemployment sits at around 20%, and comes right at the bottom of regions ranked by HDI. It's essentially an undeveloped wasteland, filled with no industry, no infrastructure, and constant stream of propaganda. Important to note that the Defence Minister Shoigu comes from Tuva, so the people, while not Russian and not Orthodox, are actually incredibly supportive of the army and the war. Will that always be the case? Probably not, but I would say Saint Petersburg has almost as much chance of declaring independence in a collapsed Russia, and even if they do, the only country they share a border with is Mongolia, so leaving Russia would likely only make them even poorer (if that's possible). 

As for Dagestan, Azerbaijan could help them out, but there have been tensions considering Dagestanis are Sunni and Azerbaijanis are predominantly Shia. Their language also comes from two completely different families, so there is no camaraderie there. 

Sakha has a lot of economic potential given its massive oil and natural gas fields, and China might certainly have incentives to support independence there. However Sakha's only access to the world is through a coast line on the Arctic Sea which is frozen half of the year. Again, excluding China or Sakha annexing enormous chunks of land to create a bridge, it would be a very uphill battle for Sakha to benefit at all from independence. 

You might argue that the regions with ethnic minorities could still work together to oust the Russian majority, and it's possible that a collapsed Russia will lead to Russians abandoning these more distant places and congregating back into the West, but such events should not be relied on at all. A lot of these ""hundreds of various cultures"" that people keep talking about have absolutely miniscule populations, and in many cases their original language has been all but lost and replaced with Russian. 

If we exclude the ethnicities of the regions I've already mentioned, as well as ethnicities who already have their own nation (e.g. Ukraine, Armenia, etc), the next region with the highest density of non-Russian minority I can find is Mordovia with the Mordvin people, who make up about 40% of their region's population (or about 320,000 out of 800,000). Again, Mordovia is smack in the middle Russia, many of the young people have abandoned the language in favour of Russian, and there has been no notable sign of or attempts at nationalism. The Mari and Udmurts are also ethnic relatives of the Mordvins (they are Finno-Ugrics), with similar ratios of population in their home regions (minor Russian majority) and no known attempts at nationalism or succession.

After that you have the Buryats in Buryatia, making up 32.5% of the population of Buryatia next to the 64% of Russian. 

I could go on but the comment is long enough already. I hope I've made my point anyway, that the Russian republic is not as ready to break apart as the USSR was in 91, not even remotely. Of course some breakaway is likely to occur eventually.

German aid was as fast as anybody else besides the US. Feel free to point to other nations that delivered that amount within that timeframe.

I’ll leave that post up. I’m happy to get downvotes for this 🤷

Not once did I rant lmao. My responses to various things have been a few sentences at best and a pretty neutral tone. 

>	German aid was as fast as anybody else besides the US. Feel free to point to other nations that delivered that amount within that timeframe.

Bro what? 

The U.K. and Poland were like the First Nations to give out any meaningful aid. UK was the First Nation to announce an extensive 10k every 3 months training regime. They were the first to announce modern tanks with the challenger 2. Like what. 

Poland was providing Ukraine tanks since last summer https://www.defensenews.com/land/2022/04/26/poland-confirms-t-72-tank-delivery-to-ukraine-with-challenger-2-tanks-to-fill-gap/ and have given like 250 Soviet era tanks. 


Bro what. 

Pretty much anytime the US announced something the U.K. follows shortly. And then Poland just decides to send whatever whenever as quickly as possible. Bro what. Baffling.


>	Who was the first to deliver modern AA systems? Again, Germany.

In Europe yes. The Gepards were just about the first major thing given to Ukraine that can be called Germans taking initiative. For that they should be applauded. Genuinely.

Most notably, that was not what everybody but Germany was thinking, as evidenced by the statements of the Netherlands for example. Maybe you should read less Visegrad news.

Again strawmanning. I haven't done that at all.

You are not responding to mine or other comments, you are responding to *an imaginary standpoint, that you yourself made up to argue against*. You obviously need to google strawmanning. 

**Here's a strawman for you:**

All these people who say Ukraine are going to retake all territory before summer and quickly win the war are being completely unreasonable. How can you even say that? This war will take a long time, it won't be as easy as you say it will be.

I don't really care about Soledar, it does not seem of great strategic importance in itself, but *it is* part of a current trend where Russia are taking territory. Sooner or later Ukraine will need to retake that territory. What I personally am saying is not important, that's not what I'm arguing about. 

>You don't think being in the army makes me a little more knowledgeable about war?

Yes? **Again you are trying to strawman.** 

Here, oxford dictionary definition of a strawman argument:

*Strawman: An intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.*

Do you understand yet? People are not interested in hearing you fight windmills. People aren't saying Ukraine are falling apart just because they are talking about the situation being difficult and Ukraine losing territory. *You* were the only one who said that, as a response to people simply (and factually correct) saying that Ukraine currently are incrementally losing territory day by day currently.
