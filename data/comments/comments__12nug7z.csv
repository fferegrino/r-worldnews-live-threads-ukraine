The location hit is a building with a green roof near the one of the most used supply route by 🇷🇺 forces in this area. Actually this building was a RemBat location for the 41st CAA's 106th seperate Logistics support brigade, here they repaired and refurbished damaged MBT's and IFV's at any time multiple vehicles would have been in this building. On satellite imagery from 11 feb. 2023, damage to the structure can be seen. Indicating that they probably tried to hit it before. Well this time they did not take any changes and hit it with an entire barrage. As can be seen on the video a large explosion occured with multiple secondary explosions indicating the presence of ammunitions inside. Imagery of today shows the extent of the damage, and also raises the question what exactly hit the location, just N of the target we can see 3 holes where ammunitions landed. As you can see in the little map below the distance from the frontlines to this target is only 24km, so a host of different ammunitions could have been used. Looking inside the destroyed building things that look to be rectangular objects can be seen however the resolution is too low to definitly identify vehicles or types. What can be said is that of a volly of 12, 9 objects hit their intended target an whreaked havoc inside.If you liked this tweet please re-tweet and like to defeat this damn twitter algoritm 👍

Day 415-417 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were mostly quiet yet again, though the demining operations happen very often now, we hear at least a couple of explosions from them pretty much every day. Recently one of the very loud explosions we heard was from an unexploded missile being blown up in Tsyrkyny. You could hear it from everywhere in Kharkiv, so it made a lot of people tense up, especially since it happened during an air raid alert.

There was also no big missile strike on Easter as many people had expected, though sadly there were a couple of small ones aimed at civilians. They killed 2 teen children in Mykolaiv oblast with a missile strike and completely destroyed a church in Zaporizhzhia oblast. Two days ago, they also hit Sloviansk with missiles, they targeted an apartment building and killed 15 civilians including a child. Targeting civilians is pointless, but for some reason they still continue doing it and thinking that it works, their stupidity never ceases to amaze me.

At least there was some payback today just a couple of hours ago. Some drones attacked Belgorod and hit a substation, which created partial blackouts across Belgorod oblast. A bit later there were also some drone attacks in Kursk oblast, though we are not sure what was hit there. What’s funny is that it made some Russians in telegram channels speculate and then get concerned about the potential offensives into those cities by our forces.",False,1681685456.0,t3_12nug7z,t3_12nug7z,,0,129,0,129,0,0,

Another horrific story of the abuses within the Russian military. While I don't have much sympathy for any Russian soldiers I do think this goes back to the root of so many problems within Russian society and military culture. There is a pervasive belief that power is the only thing that matters as well as a deep misogyny within Russia. Militaries around the world have often struggled with cultures of sexual assault and rape so this is not unique to Russia but the pervasiveness of this culture is likely keeping many otherwise qualified and capable women out of the Russian military which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the military as a whole. Militaries and organizations in general that can avoid misogyny and prevent sexual assault are going to have a major advantage over those that can't and this is yet another self inflected wound by the Russian military.",False,1681682185.0,t3_12nug7z,t3_12nug7z,,0,66,0,66,0,0,

***Their location was directly targeted by the Russians three times—and three times they survived with their lives—but it’s a testament to how the Russians targeted civilians.***

The **first day** of the invasion, the couple, who had a first-floor apartment, had their windows blown out by the **aerial bombs**.  The husband, who jokes he was too fat back then to squeeze in to the closet with his wife—was injured by shards of glass hitting his thighs; folks on street took him to hospital. 

> > ""The wound was covered with some kind of powder and a bandage was stuffed into the wound and bandaged. There were no painkillers—only ammonia was given for me to sniff, and half a glass of rum was poured for me,"" Oleksandr recalls.

> [There was no transport home.] With the last of his strength, he managed to *hop* home; the 5-minute journey took almost an hour.

Not even 24 hrs later, the Russians attacked their building, again:

> That same night, the Russians carried out **another powerful air attack** on the area where the Sladkovs lived. Judging by everything, **the purpose of the bombing was the mass destruction of residential buildings and the people who lived in them.** Because of Oleksandr's injury, the couple could not run away, so they spent the entire 5-hour attack in the apartment. And the explosions were one after another.

> > ""Imagine: an explosion, we count 7 seconds . . . and again an explosion, another 7 seconds and again. The first shells flew very close, and then we heard how the sounds gradually receded. That is, we realized that the plane was flying and just bombed everything in a row. That attack continued from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m.,""  she said.

> The Sladkovs moved move to a shelter in the Illichiv District, where they lived together with 50 other Mariupol residents for 10 days. They slept on improvised beds—a torn-off door on top of four bricks—fully clothed, with the cold still ‘reaching the bones.’

> But 10 days later, the **Russians shot their bomb shelter**—just close range **from tanks, knowing that people were hiding there**. They worked **for 4 hours**, nonstop, from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon. The walls swayed, everything shook. And the men stood with shovels in their hands; they get suddenly buried, so they’d quickly dig out. A fire started due to shelling. And people saved themselves, throwing everything in that shelter to starve to fire, along with the last crumbs of their food.

They tell of eating batter and other various uncooked food.  Literally starving, they were forced to accept food from the Russians...

> Having completely destroyed Mariupol, the occupiers pretended to be benefactors, distributing food rations to the people. One day the Russians found Maria Sladkova near her building and handed her a generator. The transfer process was filmed on camera—no matter how much she protested, it was not possible to interfere with the filming. Later, the Russians posted this video online. [Her adult son, who’d fled ahead of time, then knew at least his mother was alive.]

They were always at risk because they had been employees of the House of Culture.  Colleagues tried to persuade them to demonstrate [feign, fake] at least nominal support for Russia, for the good of keeping their lives.  This was a repugnant idea that they could not do.

> > ""The most painful thing was, you know what? Seeing how the people of Mariupol became traitors, collaborators. Some ex-colleagues [from the *Ukrainian* House of Culture] even had the audacity to suggest that we take part in a ‘cultural event for [Russia’s] Children's Day.’  Imagine the cynicism?!” an indignant Maria exclaims.  “I, of course, answered that we have *exclusively Ukrainian* content.^3 And they tell me: ‘Just write something in the Russian language, then.’ And to that, I imagined the faces of the Russian invaders, who would be sitting and listening to a poem, in the Russian language, but about how much I love Ukraine!

> > Someone said to me, ‘Masha, now, it's no longer about our principles.’ [Implying that it’s just to survive.] I was very annoyed by that comment, answering ‘Then *when* is it about principles, if not *during* this war?!’  Thank God, they did not turn us in for our Ukrainian position,^4 on the contrary, they recommended getting out of the occupation as soon as possible.""

> In mid-April, a [comms] connection appeared in the city, and the Sladkovs listened to Ukrainian radio. Once, on the air, Maria heard her own poem about Mariupol—it was read by the children of Ukrainian border guards. It was a kind of sign, so the couple dared to leave the city, leaving their broken apartment and destroyed car.

> Sladkovs left Mariupol in June, [an acquaintance supplying a vehicle in exchange for transport of their elderly relative].

^(^1) ^(For those who don’t know, a House of Culture is like a Lyceum—it is like an ongoing museum that exclusively promotes Ukrainian heritage, art, music, clothing, language, history, artifacts, performances, identity, literature, etc.  It’s like a library + art house + museum + PBS/BBC + ‘school field trip’ destination—all rolled into one.    These exist basically everywhere, not just Ukraine.  They’re usually funded by municipal, national public funds, and sometimes by endowments.)
 
^(^2) ^(The reason that it’s a bit more prominent in Mariupol is that Mariupol was 95% Russian-speaking.  With the 5% being a mix of Ukrainian, Greek, Crimean Tatar, Turkish and other languages.  It was under that background that pro-Russia sentiments were able to gain traction—more so than other Russian-speaking areas like Melitopol, Odessa, and Kherson—due *largely* to the prominence of imported Russian television influencing large swaths or the city.  Interviews with others who’ve fled said other impacts on the city was—and this seems antithetical to a free society but I’m just quoting here—‘tolerance of diverse viewpoints, including antiUkraine, which allowed proRussia sentiments to flourish, such politicians to get elected, and such leaders rise in civil society’—for example, note that an enormous percentage of the police force, in the triple digits, immediately turned against Ukraine, as recorded by public access news 0629, who’ve listed them, their rank, and their departments. Others interviewed—including the supervisory engineer at Illych, and the district superintendents of the elementary school system—have estimated that the portion of residents who were either proRussia or open to switching were ‘just under half the city’ said the superintendent to ‘well over half, maybe two-thirds’ said the engineer, with both admitting that essentially all proUkraine people fled, were killed, or were filtered. They also both noted the large portion of Russian citizens in Mariupol prior to the invasion, with the superintendent saying it made up 5-10% of the elementary teachers each year.)

^(With this background of open-to-Russian propaganda, the Ukrainian House of Culture, Mariupol had a very busy schedule...but after the invasion, it made it a target.)

^(^3) ^(As I understood previously from looking at their website a year ago, they had featured only Ukrainian heritage, but had included the content in whatever natural language it was formed in, then provided translations.  Since Mariupol children spoke Russian, this would be necessary.  It’s important to note that language does not equal culture, and the Russian language was imposed on the people in the region many generations ago.  The fact that their descendants still spoke Russian does not mean that they consider themselves Russian—indeed, Mariupol has grown with many from other regions and was considered a revitalized Ukrainian city, a Ukrainian growth/gentrification success and the residents had an Ukrainian identity.  Russian has cynically muddled the language/identity issue for centuries—they impose russian language, then use the language as an excuse to call the people Russian.  This couple featured worked in the Ukrainian-language sector of the House of Culture, in literature and poetry, as promoting the language is an element within the culture, just not the entirety of it.)

^(^4) ^(Reading stories of Ukrainians in Kherson—captured, tortured, held—tell that they’d been taken *as a result of others saying their name*.  Many say they forgive, because know it was done under torture.  Brutal, inhumane torture. Where will say *anything* for it to stop.  Even if it means that harming others, even an innocent.  That no one can predict how they’ll behave under torture. And that they know ordinary citizens are not prepared to withstand, resist such treatment.  And that they know even patriots said others names, bc Russians sometimes drugged the captives, and afterwards the captives can’t recall things, feel hazy, but a batch of new resistance folks would arrive.)",1681676955.0,1681673007.0,t3_12nug7z,t3_12nug7z,,0,73,0,73,0,0,

I watched the whole thing (at higher speed), a few salient points:

* He isn't kind to the Ukrainian general staff. Basically said that they were given two golden opportunities to annihilate large Russian groupings (1GA in Kharkiv and the VDV divisions in Kherson), but were unable to complete the task despite having overwhelming forces. Also criticized them for dismissing the use of drones. A bit more concerning is how he said they haven't learned.
* That being said, he said that radio interceptions confirmed how multiple elite brigades (airborne, rifle, GRU) had to be reconstituted with fresh recruits at least once, meaning that some of Russia's most elite unites have been wiped out in all but name. 
* Contrary to what most of OSINT states, Bakhmut is quite strategic, as it allows Russia to firm up its defensive lines along the Donetsk canal. If Bakhmut holds, it allows the Ukrainians to use that as a potential jumping off point, which forces the Russians to allocate more resources to guarding it. Same reason why they risked so much to attack Vulhedar and Adiivka, as taking them would have denied the Ukrainians potential offensive springboards. A bit disappointed in how Soledar was taken, but still supports the decision to defend Bakhmut. 
* Contrary to what many (myself included) have said, the Russian winter offensive wasn't to take the Donbas, but to limit the future impact of the Ukrainian offensive. In that sense, they still failed. 
* He is cautiously optimistic about the counteroffensive, but acknowledges that outcomes on both extremes are possible. If the Ukrainian generals are incompetent enough (like in Kharkiv and Kherson), it could grind to a stalemate. If early success is achieved and Russian morale crumbles, Crimea may even be on the table.

Tldr, while many of us here (myself included) are rightfully hopeful of Ukraine's chances in the coming counteroffensive, the Ukrainian army (generals) isn't perfect, and we shouldn't lose hope should their performance in the field fall short. Regardless of what happens, Ukraine is in this for the long run, and in light of all the Russian atrocities committed and the potential threat to western democracies should Ukraine lose this war, we should continue to support them every step of the way.",False,1681686633.0,t3_12nug7z,t3_12nug7z,,0,106,0,106,0,0,

And early in the war I caught an interview with a US officer that had trained the Ukrainian's after the 2014 invasion and said that one of the hardest things to do in war is keep division sized elements in pursuit of an enemy force and adapt to quickly changing circumstances. He commented how the US has the most soldiers well trained in combined arms warfare and it is still something they screw up in training exercises on US soil let alone in an actual war, it's just hard to get chunks of around 1,000 men to move in unison without it being preplanned. He said the Ukrainian's struggled with it but underlined that every army does.

So although obviously this guy has insight to the state of the Ukrainian army it is of course much easier to say ""well we had 5,000 men, why couldn't we just get them there in time?"" than to actually get 5,000 men where you wanted them to be. There is also risk in going off mission or pushing further than you planned which could risk the gains you have made, once again easier to say ""keep pushing!"" when you don't know how well rested and supplied your troops are or what risks might be involved. There is a chance your adhoc attack turns into a disaster.

What he says is also somewhat contradictory on one hand he lambasts the missed opportunities to destroy some Russian elite units but admits that many others have been completely wiped out and reconstituted. I get both things can be true, you could have missed an opportunity and been successful elsewhere, but there have been many Ukrainian successes as well in the war.

This is not to say that I think that Ukrainian General staff must be perfect and have always made the right moves but more to point out that many times in military history commanders have been taken to task for not exploiting an opportunity. It's only later on when more is known about what was happening behind the scenes that you can make a proper assessment as whether not pursing those forces was a mistake or was because they were running low on ammo and fuel and further pursuit might risked already large gains. When even US officers admit that maneuvering large forces is extremely challenging and something even they don't get right that says something about the difficulties involved in such large offensive operations.",False,1681691883.0,t3_12nug7z,t1_jgjjxis,,1,44,0,44,0,0,

The most common complaint that I've seen is that Ukraine's military is still set up somewhat like Russia's military. That they have way more command than is needed.

One soldier I listened to bring this up compared it to the time they spent with western military groups training. He said that in the west officers are not seen very often. He said that when officers showed up when he was training they gave commands and went away. That there was no questioning what they said because there was no question about their command. He said with the Ukraine military that there is so many officers that they would be seen everywhere. They wouldn't always know who was in charge over their group. That officers was so common that you would commonly see them hanging out with regular soldiers.

I spent some time in the US Army and I can say this is pretty true. It depended on the officer but usually you only seen an officer for short periods of time unless something really good was happening or something really bad had already happened.

Early on in the war things looked comparatively better for Russia and yet even then China wasn't willing to go out on a limb to supply Russia so why would China go out of their way now to supply Russia when the situation is increasingly dire?
 
My totally amateur guess is that when war started China, too, expected Russia to carry out their conquest with relatively ease. So instead of dirtying their hands, they chose to stand clear and keep their hands clean. Russia probably didn't ask for any help, either, so taking the neutral stance was that much easier for China.
 
When Russia started to withdrew their troops from northern Ukraine, it had become painfully clear to both Russia and China that this time around the west was pretty much united to support Ukraine against Russia. This along with all the sanctions placed on Russia at a time China was still struggling with their covid situation probably spooked China enough to stand clear of this mess to buy time to solve their internal issues and to weigh what to do about this war.
 
Now China has more or less stabilized and solved their internal crisis, but they may not yet have a clear answer to supporting Russia or not. They know giving lethal support to Russia could very well mean sanctions for them too, but if they don't support Russia now, who will support China if/when they decide to make a move on Taiwan. If they leave Russia hanging now, they very likely won't be getting support from them later.
 
So it's not really about the situation in Ukraine per se, but securing support for their own possible future conquest while trying to avoid getting sanctioned for as long as possible. China has been able to play the clock until now, but with Ukraine's counter-offensive looming, they'll soon have to make a decision on whether to risk their business relations with the west or postpone all Taiwan dreams.",False,1681686983.0,t3_12nug7z,t1_jgjbz02,,2,15,0,15,0,0,

Normally, these spin offs cut weight by not adding the MBT armor modules. The thing is, the T-72 was lighter, so it made sense to use the common chassis for a huge range of vehicles. Whereas the West has really heavy MBT's, so they tend to use their lighter mid-weight chassis (e.g. LAV/Stryker, Boxer, etc.) for the modular vehicles (outside of the obvious MBT-based spinoffs, like engineering and bridge).

Especially since it isn't an uncommon thing that horrible dictators recieve moderate amounts of praise from the population because they manage to frame it as if that all good things are a result of them personally and all bad things are a result of an evil foreign empire.

But after consulting with chatGPT it appears that healthcare and education did improve significantly after Castro came to power. At the same time, however, Castro's repression triggered several large refugee waves from the country which didn't happen during the previous regime to a sginificant degree. Also, it is unclear how much of the improvement was a result of aid from the soviet union since they gave Cuba quite a generous amount each year which resulted in food and fuel-shortages when the soviet union collapsed. But to be fair, they were also sanctioned by the US
