Day 134 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today Russians shelled our residential districts from their MLRS during the day, as always not a single military target was hit, but they killed 3 civilians. After that there was one big explosion at around 10:20pm, most likely from a missile, but weirdly enough nobody reported it. Though there was another report of a missile exploding in the air in Russia again. Also at 3:20am we had an air alert, but no explosions followed, missiles were most likely intercepted, there was another launch at 3:34am, that time one missile did manage to get through, but what happened to the rest of them is unknown.

In that yesterday’s missile strike, the two missiles that managed to get through, they hit yet another “military target” as Russia calls them. It was a school for the special needs children, though they didn’t manage to completely destroy it, missiles landed in the courtyard and broke all the windows, but that’s it. It seems like Russia is extremely scared of those children, they just can’t stop destroying all the schools they see. At the same time yet another Russian ammo dump is currently exploding, this time in Shakhtarsk, they will probably retaliate by destroying another school.

Today’s Putin’s statement was pretty funny, apparently they haven’t even started fighting for real yet. I don’t think those 30k+ dead Russians would agree that they were actually just playing around, not giving it their all. A thousand destroyed tanks, over 4000 vehicles lost, and 10 generals dead? That’s child’s play; we haven’t even started dying for real yet. Just you wait, soon T-34 will roll out, and then the fighting will actually start.

Now they're in absolute danger of being destroyed at \~85km range from the frontline. HIMARS brings pinpoint accuracy with a big warhead, this coupled with good intel on the locations of these distribution points is what makes them so effective.

The big bottleneck of russian logistics is the 'last mile' to the front. The major distances are covered by train, all up to the respective logistical hub near the frontline, from there fuel, ammo and food gets transported by truck. This 'last mile' is the most problematic for russian forces, since they just don't have a lot of trucks and their logistics are nowhere near the 21st century (no forklifts, no pallets, just loading and unloading by hand).

And now, this distance from a safe logistical hub to the frontline has more than doubled. This is the important part. With the same amount of trucks and manpower, the russian flow of war goods has basically halved.

And with this we haven't even considered the lost ammo due to explosions and the danger to command posts.

Just to put the low number of HIMARS into perspective in respect to covering the frontline: 

8 HIMARS are enough to cover 75% of the entire frontline and put every single command post and logistical hub in danger. All the Ukrainians need for this are coordinates.

It's not a magic solution to human tendencies toward armed conflict, but the more that each side has to lose by cutting economic ties, the less incentive there is to do something radical that cuts those economic ties.

This concept of ""interdependence reduces conflict and encourages diplomacy"" idea only works if both sides feel as though the interdependence is fairly even; that breaking it apart would damage both sides equally... Or that the other side will not risk their economies and interdependence over a small incursion here... then there... then there...

Putin seems to have become convinced that the alliance of dozens of individual democracies is weak and fallible compared to totalitarianism, so they would become disjointed upon the threat of cutting off interdependency. 

It's a bet that a conglomerate of independent democracies is a more vulnerable house of cards than a unified dictatorship. Unfortunately for Russia the value of democracy and an open society is more powerful than it's weaknesses. Societies that allow for diversity and dissent are better able to adapt to change, whereas authoritarian societies are less flexible and rely on maintaining stasis in a changing world by cracking down on diversity of thought.

All countries experience an ebb and flow between these styles of govt over centuries, so it's not a hit on Russia. The U.S. is on a dangerous trajectory that seems to have enough momentum that every brake applied has done very little to stop it.

That combined w/ their inability to do anything other than mass attack an individual area or use unguided ballistic munitions almost guarantees they won't be able to keep making even marginal progress in the long term.

Last Winter the Russians were losing scores of troops to frostbite and exposure.  The attacks on their supply lines, this at the time was just w/ the TB2 drones/territorial defense, forced Russian front line troops to subsist on looted food from supermarkets and the local wildlife (mostly wild dogs).

That is NOT going to be the case in the upcoming Winter.  The grocery stores in any front line area are either going to be devoid of provisions due to the war, the Ukrainians will evacuate civilians and supplies alike ahead of Russian attacks, and HIMARS are hitting Russian supply depots in force.  12 Russian Army supply depots were destroyed in the past week alone and that was just w/ 9 of those platforms.  Imagine how much harder Russian logistics are going to be hit at a time when resource consumption will be even higher as troops need to consume more calories while moving around in the cold, and they have to use more fuel to not only keep their fires going, but keep their vehicles going just to run the heat.

It's also worth noting that Russian armored vehicles became sitting ducks in the Winter b/c by them keeping their heaters on they became easy targets for thermal imaging to discover.  The Russians were using yoga mats and asbestos from inside looted homes just to barely cover their vehicles, and that's not going to work against an even larger Ukrainian professional force w/ even more access to the NATO arsenal.

\- If you start with the assumption that Russia will succeed moving forward gobbling up territory over the next year or two, I believe the absolute best result they could achieve is claiming all of the land East of the Dnipro River that splits the country in half. Its a major geographical obstacle that can be defended by the Ukrainians and their allies. Under that huge assumption, Russia gains that ground, claims 40% of Ukraine, and declares a tenuous victory.

\- If you assume things will go much the way they are now, I don't see much success for Russia beyond their southern land bridge and the Donbas and Luhansk regions that they essentially occupy today. Most gains they have made in the last month have been offset by losses in other areas. How this assumption ends is the most uncertain, as it will literally come down to willpower between Ukraine and Russia. Under this scenario, it takes two to stop the fighting. Either a deal will have to be reached or someone will have to give up. The most uncertain thing in this scenario is the economic and timeframe side of things. how long does it take and how willing is Russia or Ukraine + it's allies (because Ukraine can't survive at this point without the West's weapons and money) to continue the fight.

\- The last possible assumption is that the war is hitting a U-turn right now. Stronger and stronger weapons continue to pour in from the West and the Russian military is worn down and retreats. The biggest question here is where does it stop and does the same retreat happen in Crimea. The thing about Crimea is that one of Russia's historically largest naval bases at Sevastopol is located here. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia continued to lease Sevastopol from Ukraine much the same way they lease the Baikonur space launch complex from Kazakhstan. The invasion and annexation of Crimea was all about reclaiming this military asset and its hard to imagine them giving that up without a massive fight.

I do believe, in the end, Ukraine will get a lot of its land back. Crimea is a toss-up in my mind. The real question I have is how far is the West willing to go, because Ukraine is limited economically and militarily without our collective support. If i had to bet on how the war ends, i think the West will directly determine that by telling Ukraine ""Ok, we helped you get most of your land back, after this you're on your own so you better sign a peace treaty soon."" The economic position of Russia will greatly steer what happens next as well.

Of course, If China decides to get involved, all bets are off. I don't see this as likely, because I don't see this fight as being in their interest. They have bigger fish to fry, and they don't have the same economic issues/constraints that Russia does.",False,1657213241.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_if83pw5,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

>The Kremlin continued to set conditions for the crypto-mobilization of the Russian economy in anticipation of protracted operations in Ukraine. The Russian State Duma adopted the third and final reading of a law introduced by the cabinet of ministers on June 30 that will allow the Russian government to oversee and regulate labor relations in Russian enterprises (both state and privately-owned).[4] This law, as ISW has previously reported, will allow government officials to recall workers from personal vacations, reschedule time off without employee consent, and require employees to work weekends, holidays, and nights. These measures allow the Kremlin to take much more direct control of most aspects of the Russian economy, including suspending rights and protections some workers would normally have.[5] The law must still be sent to the Federation Council before it reaches Russian President Vladimir Putin and is officially published, but the Kremlin is likely seeking to use the law to leverage domestic labor to maximize economic output and prepare for protracted operations in Ukraine.[6] Russia’s largest lead production plant reportedly stopped production on July 6 due to the almost-total halt of Russian metallurgical exports, and the Kremlin will likely continue to take measures to codify economic mobilization to offset or mitigate the effects of sanctions and the war on essential industries.[7]

Russia already made the choice to lose.  It just didn't know it at the time.  It has now embarked on Afghanistan 2.0 with a level of partisan activity that's right next to its own borders.  It's up to them how they want to try to escape.  The west is just accelerating the inevitable.

And taking the opportunity to help Russia whittle down its offensive capacity to nothing.  They are free to continue on this path, but it's hardly wise.  But they aren't demonstrating a lot of intelligence in this regard.

Because they kicked the beehive that is NATO while they were at it.   

But despite these massive blunders, their territorial integrity and sovereignty are not threatened.  

However...

... if they launch nukes, their cities will be reduced to radioactive black glass and what remains of humanity will ensure that Russia ceases to exist as a sovereign power.

Here's some video footage of the Ukrainians loading a HIMARS system in the field.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBv5GueHdo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWBv5GueHdo) \- and yes, it's a straightforward process.   But that's not the key thing to focus on.   Let's look at how we get that missile pod sitting where it is to be loaded.

Here's a thread by  Thomas C. Theiner (@noclador), Italian Army vet, addressing the challenges of handling artillery supply, both in Russian and Western-style militaries. [https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1528024733983424512.html](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1528024733983424512.html) \- it's specifically pages 10-14 that are more relevant for the discussion.

Note the sheer amount of equipment you need to get that pod into place to load.  You've got to truck it in, and have the right equipment, either crane, forklift, or whatnot, to put the pod down on the ground.  The challenge is everything that comes before the loading and firing.     Without enough equipment to support the supply (keep in mind - US and NATO armies usually have entire portions of an artillery battalion dedicated to the act of supply), HIMARS becomes a fancy truck with a useless pipe organ.

And if the Russians are going to damage the ability to deploy HIMARS on the battlefield, they would be hunting for the locations and equipment used to deploy the ammunition, and not the HIMARS themselves.  That brings about security and protection issues as well, which given the Ukrainians are at a fine balancing point, may be challenging.   I think the Ukrainians are partially mitigating this by loading the HIMARS units in a suitably protected backline area, trucking the HIMARS to the front, firing the missiles, and then bringing them back to reload.   It keeps them safe, but it's impossible to sustain fire with that back and forth.

So when we look at support for the war effort, it's increasingly just as important to look for deliveries of this support equipment along with the HIMARS.   And given how heavy and bulky that support equipment can be to bring to the front, that's the major holdback on the number of deployed HIMARS being able to provide sustainable fire rates.",False,1657206549.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_if6xzu3,,2,5,0,5,0,0,

Then, they aren't rock crawling or mudding through fields... they'll largely use the road network from highways to back dirt roads which further reduces the potential locations that drones will have to look. They simply aren't that hard to find.

Relatively safely sitting back out of range pounding frontline positions will come into play sooner than later. Hitting those targets deep in occupied territory as they're doing now requires them to move into RU frontline range, take their few shots, then gtfo before they get spotted and some lead dropped on them.

Suffice to say... they spend vastly more time moving and only brief periods of fire each day.

He can go to HM The Queen and advise her that he no longer commands the confidence of the House, and recommend that she invite a named individual to try and form a government instead.  She would then follow that advice.  The problem is that, right now, it is not clear who he should recommend to Her Majesty is in a position to try and form a government (some suggest he should immediately go and recommend his deputy, Dominic Raab; others suggest that he should wait until a new leader of the majority/Conservative party has been selected in order to provide such clarity and avoid any possible embarrassment of Her Majesty).

The timetable for selecting a new leader of the Conservative party is not set in stone, and will largely be determined by their ""1922 Committee"".  Unfortunately the 1922 Committee is in the midst of changes of its own, which are due to be resolved on Monday; it is expected that they will then quickly announce the timetable for the leadership contest; chances are that the first round (where Conservative MPs whittle the choices down to no more than two) will be completed before the House rises for its summer recess on 22 July.

If there is only one remaining candidate at that point, the matter is resolved and the party has its new leader; Boris should then immediately go to the Palace and give his advice.

That assumes that nations are playing a zero-sum game where a loss for one side is balanced by a loss by the other. But life is not a zero-sum game: I am no better off because my neighbor suffers.

Interdependence means that maintaining good relationships is in everyone's best interest, because when those relationships break down, everyone suffers. That is what creates the desire for cooperation and compromise.

The problem is that this assumes that in a nation, the interests of the state are aligned with the interests of the public.

That's kind of a weak argument. The 2014 phase of the Russo-Ukranian war isn't even remotely comparable to 2022's active combat scale or intensity. 2014 Ukraine's army was not in a state of country wide mobilization, nor did it have NATO wartime training to the degree that it's gotten in the last 8 years. It's active duty army and territorial defense forces have more than tripled size since 2014. It was not being supplied military aid from allies to even a fraction of the degree it is today. Russia didn't coordinate a country wide assault, they did not deploy as large a force as 2022's, and the imposed sanctions are not even in the same ballpark in terms of economic impact.

When taking all of the above factors into account, it's much more likely that the Russian offensive completely collapses under it's own weight if it doesn't manage to completely neutralize Ukraine's constantly re-supplied combat capabilities. It's very much a probability that Russia won't be able to just stall and squat this one out like in 2014.

Then you have the ""separatist"" meat shields from Donetsk, Luhansk, etc; I don't know their numbers, but generally they're so poorly equipped that they're not a big threat. The Wagner Company is around ~10K, IIRC. The Chechens I'd guess number around 5K or something, but a lot of what they do is terror PR (they're called the TikTok brigade for a reason), and most of their duties seem to entail shooting videos, propaganda, shooting deserters, torture, etc; they're not much of a military force. In Transnistria there are around 5K pro-Kremlin Moldovans, but they haven't entered the fray (and at the time being it seems like the won't), the Belarusians have been mostly out-of-conflict so far; I don't know their numbers but Lukashenko would have a hard time trying to mobilize them against Ukraine due to his precarious situation and the low interest among Belarusians in joining the conflict, depending on the source the Syrians number between 2K and 10K; but it seems like a lot of them aren't very interested in the war, the Georgian separatists (Abkhazians and South Ossetians) number in a few thousand; but it seems like many of them return home as soon as they can, and the Africans are few in numbers as well. And since Russia haven't had a general mobilization, they've had a lot of struggles in getting new recruits as well (legally they've mostly been limited to contractors); but I don't know any exact numbers. If I were to make a guess, I'd probably guess at around 200~280K pro-Kremlin combatants so far.

As for casualties, it varies a lot depending on the source. The Ukrainian defense's enemy death toll is at 36.5K with at least 1K PoW, and the ratio of wounded per kill that tends to be used is the common international 3:1 ratio (but Russia don't care as much about saving wounded soldiers as western militaries do and their first aid is severely lacking, so it wouldn't surprise me if 2:1 would be more accurate). Conservative estimates would be around 25-30K dead and other estimates range from 15-25K, but they're generally very outdated. And I think these numbers mainly include Russian soldiers (as well as DPR and LPR deaths). So it wouldn't surprise me if the actual death toll is closer to 40K with around 80~120K wounded.

OP wrote about being ""baffled"" that this could go on. 

Look... Let's take the other view for a second. Let's say Russia's offense collapses completely and their military retreat to its borders.  Then what?

Do you think for one moment they will lay down arms, join hands singing Kumbaya and think peaceful loving thoughts in Ukraine's direction?  I don't.   I suspect they will insinuate fulmination of little green, grey and purple men - if only just to demonstrate that they weren't entirely wrong in starting this thing in the first place.  And that's if they just retreat all the way back across their borders.

One scenario vastly more plausible than that is that they collapse and retreat back to 2014 borders.  And just go back to what was going on before hand.  Which wasn't sanctionable by the west so we might see some give there in this scenario, and is entirely sustainable even if sanctions do continue. 

An also-plausible scenario is that a new dispute border is drawn somewhere between what was disputed since 2014.   And that too can continue. 

Because even though Ukraine could potentially mobilize a million people, they can't easily sustain an offensive condition and there are actual people in the disputed territories who are not entirely thrilled about being Ukrainian.   Maybe a lot fewer now than there were in 2014... but Ukraine needs to be careful that it keeps the moral high-ground if it wants continued support from teh west... because at this stage it is about to become entirely dependent upon the manufacturing capacity of teh west to sustain any offensive capacity!

In just any plausible ""end-game"" other than a complete revolt within Russia, military activity on Ukraine's territory will continue for the foreseeable future.  

This is a very very complicated situation.  It is not (or should not be) ""baffling"" at all that it will take years to resolve.",1657213310.0,1657212376.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_if84j6a,,3,1,0,1,0,0,
c5e3671995eea155d3caccfd05147354,vt9ef4,if82kah,"Well, then you are baffled by something I don't think people are talking about.  

I really don't think anyone with three functioning neurons expects the conflict to continue at this intensity for much longer. It's not sustainable.  Not even for the west.   Both sides are burning through ammunition, fuel and equipment faster than it can be produced, other than on a war footing, and that has to end.  Whoever runs out first is likely to lose the most (from where they are at the time). It's a law of thermodynamics kind of thing. Support by the west is designed to minimize the risk that Ukraine is this loser.

However, as much as Russia might ""lose"", the question is ""to where""? The ultimate position is unknown, but it's likely not going to be all the way back to Russia's borders... and could still be farther into Ukraine than the 2014 borders, which were, until February, subject to ongoing skirmishes.    And then what?

Ultimately, this may still fulminate in an ongoing ""war"" of entrenched positions, attacks, skirmishes, missiles being launched from Belgorod etc.  - and that ""terminal"" phase of the conflict could be sustained pretty much indefinitely.  

Yes sanctions bite, but don't overweight them in your calculations.

Suppose, however, we have a science fiction cloning device so we can have the same pilot but store one newbie copy for 15 years while the other accumulates flying experience.  I wager the veteran wins every time in an F16A vs a newbie flown F16E.   

Some fundamental basics will never change.  It is Earth's air the wings push against.  Petroleum fuel burns in air releasing energy.  Aspects of improved flight definitely happen but they are incremental.  Nothing like the change from piston engine to jet engine has occured.  

Same for 2 F16A vs one 1 F16E.  A match of 8 vs 4 is not the same as 2 planes vs 1 but I would place the same bets.  I am curious where pilots would place their bets on matchups between various blocks.  

Fuel is complex.  It is assumed you run away when almost out of fuel.  Full tanks means you can dump into afterburners.  However, half the weight of an F16 (or 1/3 of bombs plus plane) is fuel.  An almost empty aircraft with one missile and a few bullets has double the thrust/weight and half the weight loading on the wings.  No engine upgrades match that magnitude.  


My impression is that none of these bets work with F22.  A quartet of trained but young pilots could fly through a wing of F16s and and shoot down the refueling planes plus a few fighters and then fly back to base.",False,1657223938.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_if7ozy5,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

One of the open-secrets of this war is that NATO nations have been flying our AWACS aircraft 24/7 as things have been going on. Part of this is for the lovely signals intelligence that we've gotten from ""listening"" to Russia's radars and electronic warfare systems. And the other part is because we were massively helping Ukraine out. They can keep all their SAM radars completely offline and we feed them target location data. In effect, they just flick on the radar for JUST long enough to get a lock and fire the missile, then they bring it down and scoot away. Or simply put, they only turn on their radars when they already know there's something to shoot. Once Ukraine is using Patriot and other NATO standard equipment, they'll have access to the Link 16 data network. Meaning that Ukraine will (theoretically) NEVER have to turn those radars on, because they can use the tracking data from the AWACS aircraft as the targeting information. In reality, they will likely turn them on now and then to keep up the fiction that NATO isn't feeding them that data.

While Russia doesn't really have an equivalent to Link 16, they do still have the ability to do the other tactic. Meaning that a small drone with a radar receiver is only going to detect the emissions from the AWACS hundreds of miles away.",False,1657215303.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_if7kmco,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

That's a little misleading. By 1943, a third of the US GDP was being spent on the military. Entire industries had been shifted into the production of tanks, airplanes, ships, and the thousands of other cogs that go into the war machine. 

As for outproducing the entire world, that's just not true. Individual nations, yes. But not the entire world. And consider this: the Soviet Union produced about 66,000 tanks in WWII. The US produced more than 80,000. But the Soviet Union's most industrialized regions *were occupied or destroyed*. Imagine if our industrial heartland - Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, etc. - were occupied or destroyed.

Again, a poor comparison.  Kim Il-sung and his successors spent 70+ years sticking close to the Stalin communist formula, where as Soviets under Khrushchev actively worked to reject it. Gorbachev and later Yeltsin were largely responsible for the political and societal reforms that Russia went through. Russia of the past 30-40 years is far closer to a Kleptocratic American style capitalist pseudo-democracy than it is ""hail to our great supreme leader"". So while many economic calamities like the great NK famine of the 90's hit, you couldn't expect much of a rebellious/reformist cultural shift from a Korea cluster. They've been baptized in imperialist rule from the Japanese to the Kim dynasty, they literally know nothing else. They are also so insanely isolated from other societal ways of life, that showing them otherwise would be like fostering a serious case of Stockholm syndrome.

Soviet Union's collapse lead to the declared independence of 15 states precisely BECAUSE today's Slavs aren't North Koreans. So while Putin is actively working to bring Russia back to Stalinism, its gonna take at minimum 2 generations to foster a full ""dissent-free"" authoritarian state that is completely gated from the standards of living they've enjoyed these past decades. Putin's propaganda may have a lock and key on the current anti-west sentiment, but until Putin has gapped out enough generations of this, a repeat of 1991 is very much in the cards.

**So TLDR:** Russia is much closer to 1991 then it is to WW2 Stalin communism. You don't need to see Putin ""overthrown"" to witness another earthquake, I'd say this scenario is far more likely than not.

The Wikipedia article does make mention of a 'container' the surface launched version is held in and that drops off after a VLS launch. That seemed like a good candidate for what we're looking at, but none of the other launch videos I've found doesn't show anything like what we see in this one.

Nobody mentions acting in absolutes, in fact Germany hasn't acted in any absolutes so far unless you count cowering for the first three months of the conflict.

Germany is still able to get oil from Russia and they aren't going to cut off Germany cold turkey. The narrative of Weak Germany can't help Ukraine is laughable when Germany is the largest economy in the EU but is being outdone by PL,UK,and many more frankly smaller economic powers.

Just say you don't care about Ukrainians and other Europeans and that you can happily pile up there dead aslong as it doesn't block your window view.

You don't need to act as if you have some big brain through pattern or understand ""cause and effect"" better than anyone else. It's like being in first year of University again.

Germany can and will source alternatives to oil slowly and has been. Germany has been stepping up albeit slowly, Germany is rearming and beginning to be a voice in Europe.

62cbc5f2e24c521c0db594b66de93703,vt9ef4,ifaiyjs,"Let me explain to you what absolutes mean. You think that Germany is on Russia's side because it is buying Russian gas, even though the reality of the situation is that Germany has been sending weapons, ammunition, equipment and supplies to Ukraine from day one. It has pulled the most advanced howitzer in the world from its active inventory (that Germany needs to fulfill NATO obligations, by the way) to help Ukraine.
And yet you seem to think Germany isn't helping. That is what thinking in absolutes means.

And I know the statistics you are citing in your claim that Poland has done more than Germany. Those could only take into account what has been publicly announced. But the reality of the situation is that Germany has been supplying weapons and equipment without disclosing it. So while everyone was memeing about 5000 helmets, Germany was actually helping.

Secondly, the German ministry of economy and energy seems to think that Russia cutting off the gas valves is plausible, and I definitely trust them more than some random guy on reddit.

Thirdly, this narrative of a weak Germany is mostly related to its military, which has faced budget cuts as it was thought that it was not needed in current times of only operating in asymmetrical warfare in the middle east. Anyone criticizing Germany for this is absolutely right, the German government should have seen Russian aggression for what it is much sooner. But people have to understand that it cannot just take weapons and equipment out of the active inventory.

Fourthly, I do care about Ukrainians, I want them to win the war and I want Russia to be isolated and confined to its own borders. If I was living in Germany and dependent on gas myself, I would turn off my heating in the winter. But crippling Germany's economy to hurt Russia is just fucking stupid. It's like sawing off your right arm to shoot your enemy in the foot. Everybody loses.

I don't think that I am particularly smarter than the average person, I just think people advocating for Germany to stop the import of Russian gas immediately are idiots who cannot think long-term.

I also hope that Germany will turn itself around quickly and that it has learned its lessons from this situation.",False,1657246953.0,t3_vt9ef4,t1_ifadyky,,1,1,0,1,0,0,
