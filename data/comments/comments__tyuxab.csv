Day 44 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today shelling continued again, but we did hear our artillery more times than we did incoming shelling. Also people that were driving to Derhachi to fix electricity hit a mine on their way there, apparently they survived, but got hospitalized. Russians are leaving mines everywhere, it probably won’t be safe to go anywhere for a long time after this.

I don’t understand what Russia is even planning to do after this war ends, it doesn’t even matter if they win or lose. At this point they are just fucked either way. Why are they doubling down each time they do some new atrocity, do they just not care about what happens in the future? I can’t even imagine what the next Russian president will have to do to get their country out of this hole that they are digging right now.

Something funny we saw when reading some Russian comments, even if it’s not much, some of them are starting to question the bullshit that they are being fed. Someone wrote “if Ukrainian army is fighting with their own civilians, then who is our army fighting with?” Yeah, who are they fighting with? Are they really incapable of winning against an army that is preoccupied with killing their own people?

The lies are getting more unbelievable with each passing day, so at some point more of their people should start questioning them. While most sane people that are not from Russia can see through their lies, the thing that matters the most is if Russians believe in them, as they are the only ones capable of changing anything in their own country. 

Their prideful imperialistic mentality just needs to be erased, but I’m not sure if it’s even possible, definitely not until they see the truth of what is happening. The worst case scenario would be if they did see the truth, acknowledged that what they did was wrong, and then instead of changing anything they would just continue doing it, hopefully that won’t happen.

Primarily the fact that reservists in Russia are not like reservists in the US, who can be deployed at a moment's notice due to their continual training. Russian reservists are retired conscripts who will require a 4-week boot camp before being deployed. Of course the most obvious point here is that, if true, Russia is planning for months of fighting ahead of them. It also means their losses are likely much higher than western estimates, and quite possibly in line with the previously presumed inflated estimates from Ukraine.

From CNN's Luke McGee, Nathan Hodge, Lauren Kent, Claudia Otto and Nadine Schmidt

Germany's foreign intelligence service told a parliamentary committee Wednesday that it has intercepted radio communications where Russian soldiers talked about shooting soldiers and civilians in Ukraine, a source with knowledge of the meeting said.

The briefing was the top item at the Wednesday meeting, the source added.

Those intelligence findings — first reported by Der Spiegel — appear to implicate Russian troops in a pattern of apparent war crimes despite denials from Moscow, most recently in the indiscriminate killing of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.

The death toll from a missile strike on a train station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, has risen to 50, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the head of Donetsk region military administration.

In an update on Telegram, Kyrylenko said 50 people had died, five of   
whom were children, adding that 12 of the victims died after being taken  
 to the hospital. 

""We have such a large number of victims at this hour as a result of the   
attack of the Russian occupation forces Tochka-U \[ballistic missile\] on   
the Kramatorsk railway station,"" he said. ""At that moment, 98 people   
have been taken to hospitals. We expect that other victims will seek   
medical help within one or two days, so the number of victims will be   
constantly changing.""

Of the 98 wounded who were taken to medical facilities, 16 were children, 46 were women and 36 were men, Kyrylenko said.

Russia's military registration and enlistment offices have redoubled efforts to “solve the problem of replenishing its units with human resources,” the Ukrainian military wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday.

Ukraine says Russian recruiters are now conscripting those who have been discharged from military service since 2012, particularly drivers, mechanics, reconnaissance specialists and junior commanders.

Ukraine also believes Russia is looking to sign up Russian passport holders in the Transnistria region of Moldova, home to a separatist movement. A small Russian military contingent has been based in Transnistria since the early 1990s, but the region shares no borders with Russia and it is unclear how it could provide recruits to the Russian military in significant numbers. ",False,1649409607.0,t3_tyuxab,t3_tyuxab,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had indicated that his country would be willing to pay for Russian gas in rubles after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree demanding that ‘unfriendly countries’ will be required to pay for gas in the currency. 

The EU were in discussions with Budapest, Von der Leyen told CNN.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has admitted that Russia has suffered “significant” casualties in its invasion of Ukraine.

“We have significant losses of troops, and it’s a huge tragedy for us,” Peskov told Sky News Thursday night.

Ukrainian forces have surprised leaders and military experts the world over in their ability to push back on Russian military advances six weeks into the war, though both sides have suffered high casualty numbers.

NATO estimates that Russia’s death toll could be as high as 15,000 troops, while Moscow last announced its casualty figures on March 25 at 1,351 deaths.

War has hammered the country’s globally important farming sector, and left one poultry-plant manager with a dangerous cleanup

Europe’s largest poultry farm, on Ukraine’s occupied Black Sea coast, has lost almost four million chickens to thirst and starvation during the country’s war with Russia. It falls to plant manager Andriy Chirkov to clean up the disaster left behind.

The war has already disrupted Ukraine’s prodigious exports of wheat, sunflower oil and other produce, boosting global food costs. It has also halted production at the Chornobaivske chicken farm, situated in a southern part of Ukraine that has experienced some of the heaviest fighting. The facility, which typically exports about one billion eggs a year, is just one of several to have been hit in one of the world’s biggest producers.

The chicken factory’s difficulties are emblematic of the broader impact Russia’s invasion is having on Ukraine’s agriculture sector. The industry not only plays a crucial role in feeding the world but also represents the biggest contributor of the country’s economy, raising the specter of a slow recovery if and when peace returns.

Highlights:

* the Ukrainians need artillery and rockets, to defeat Russian attacks in an area more favorable to them than the area north of Kyiv was.  Javelins and Stingers won’t do it.
* Once again, we are failing at the challenge of scale and urgency.
* This isn’t the time for exquisite distinctions between offensive and defensive weapons, hesitance about training them, fear of escalation (from a mediocre opponent).

Re the matériel being sent 

* But what they need for the battle shaping up in the south is artillery and multiple launch rocket systems.  And lots of ammunition.  Fast.

* Russian troops from the contigents sent toward Kyiv that has been withdrawn through Belarus to redeploy to the east, is largely a spent force. From that force, *most* of the forward logistics units are simply gone, multiple BTG's in all practicality no longer exist, lots of BTG's have sustained heavy casulaties (20-50% losses). There are units that have to some degree avoided big losses, but the general mauling they went through will have spread word to *everyone* in those units of the colossal fuck-up and losses. Putting them into the east, even reconsituted, is a worse option than delegating them to quiet front parts. Their stories and morale will have severe negative effects on fresh troops they get put in with.

* Russia is in the process of bleeding off more BTG's from divisions on pretty much all border areas away from Ukraine to get new troops and reinforcements. They alreafy pulled heavily on this pool to get the attack force ready for Ukraine. They are getting danger thin in places if this continues, and that may well become a temptation for other states currentlyhaving ""contested territories"", but that will not happend yet if it does. But if Russia hits another big loss an Donbas, and inner turmoil somehow starts to surface...they simply will be undermanned to deal with opportunistic moves from said states.

* Ukraine in Donbas has more or less held the defence line from before the 24th of February. This is an enormous defence installation in depth, with 3 huge defence lines and seriously built up defensive works. Breaking it can only be achieved by a massive flanking operation from both sides, or a very large frontal assault with colossal losses. Russia here has to outweight the Ukrainians manpower wise. Its going to take more than they have, and we may see Russia call up reservists within the next three days.

* Ukraine has large parts of their army and a lot of equipment in the east. Additionally they now have freed up resources in the north. What they will need is mobile forces in the rear to deal with flanking pincer moves, mass artillery and the ability to explout collapsed attacks. They'll be moving tons of resources in from the west, and they will now start to put troops who were called up at the start of the war who have completed basic run-up training into the fray. They've had to expend a lot of equipment to achieve the results they did, and any and all backfill from western allies now, especially in terms of vehicles, will decide of Ukraine can operate with mobility or not. Its becoming more and more clear, that for Ukraine in this war; IFV's and technicals could prove even more useful than MBT's. Those and long-range artillery.

* Kramatorsk will almost certainly become the place we'll read the most about for a few days after the russian offensive attempt starts. They're trying new army leadership, and they will be very aware of the need for a propaganda win. So they will attempt a short flanking to cut off the Ukrainian forces guarding the Donetsk/Luhansk border to force them to surrender or destroy them. The logical conclusion from that will be a push in the north from Izium to Kramatorsk, and in the south along the H-20 all the way up to Kramatorsk fron Donetsk, completing an encirclement. 


There are several ways for Ukraine to respond. But the most effective one, imho; A large scale push on Kherson. Then a wedge to Volnovakha, then Myrne, break north up to Ilovaisk. Putting the russian troops in danger of an encirclement. But admittedly thats a very large scale counter. Any ability Ukraine can build up, muster or already have to to hit-and-run wedges into Russian pincer moves could very well be sufficient to prevent the encirclement.

""The European Commission has today [8th March] proposed an outline of a plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030, starting with gas, in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



This plan also outlines a series of measures to respond to rising energy prices in Europe and to replenish gas stocks for next winter. Europe has been facing increased energy prices for several months, but now uncertainty on supply is exacerbating the problem. REPowerEU will seek to diversify gas supplies, speed up the roll-out of renewable gases and replace gas in heating and power generation. This can reduce EU demand for Russian gas by two thirds before the end of the year.""

Hi everyone! I just keep seeing some of the same arguments taking place about NATO, WWIII, Nuclear weapons, and more… and some folks just seem to think they are 100% correct on their opinions when there is actually a much more nuanced conversation to be had. I wanted to provide some alternative views to some common views by redditors I keep seeing people bringing up about the current situation.  
  
To be fully transparent, I do support more aggressive actions from NATO to save the Ukrainian people but I am weary for the repercussions of such actions. I think it is a valid discussion to have, and folks who legitimately want to talk about a NFZ or a humanitarian air corridor should not be treated like they are crazy due to some of the discussion points below.  
  
Let’s try to be open to different ideas, and not allow this forum to simply be two extremes yelling at each other…  
  
**View:** “It would be racist of NATO and the West to step in to save Ukrainians when we aren’t doing anything to save Syrians or Uyghurs”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: While the situation in China and Syria is tragic, and the west SHOULD do more to alleviate these atrocities, NATO and the west are in a completely different situation with Ukraine and to compare these crises would be comparing apples to oranges.  
  
In both Syria and China, the ‘enemy’ is not an outsider – but the local government. Unfortunately, domestic issues are far more complicated to solve from the outside than an international conflict. The west would not only have to pacify the government forces causing the violence but also occupy the country for years or decades, and commit to nation building as we would have destroyed the system that was in place.  
  
In Ukraine, the ‘enemy’ is a foreign invader and the local government would be the ‘good guys’ in this situation and no government would need to be toppled. Once the invaders are repelled and the border is fortified, a campaign within Ukraine would not need long-term occupation or nation building. I’m not saying it would be easy, just a much less complicated set of objectives than with the situation in Syria and China. It isn’t racist to admit these are vastly different situations.  
  
**View**: “NATO is only a defensive agreement, it would be undermining NATO’s integrity to become more involved”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: White NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.  
  
**View**: “If NATO engages militarily against Russia, it will result in a World War III!""  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: In order for a war to be a global conflict, it needs to span the globe. That would require 1) Russia to be able to, on its own, sustain military engagements against multiple NATO fronts around the world or 2) Russia to have allies willing to step in to defend their War in Ukraine.However, for point 1, Russia has shown that their military is far too weak and undermaintained to even employ a successful campaign against a far inferior power that happens to be their next door neighbor let alone against multiple enemies around the globe. For point 2, even Russia’s closest ally Kazakhstan has indicated their unwillingness to support Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Also, Russia’s other closest ally Belarus had most of their army threaten to mutiny if they were deployed to Ukraine. As it stands, there would be no World War III if Russia and NATO were to engage militarily.  
  
**View**: “Russia will nuke NATO if anyone tries to save Ukraine!”  
  
**Alternative perspective**: Mutually Assured Destruction has allowed for a relative peace between global powers for nearly 80 years because it is an assured suicide to launch a nuclear attack. There have been NO significant developments to the nuclear arms race that would change this basic fact. If Russia were to use a nuclear weapon, it would result in the end of Russia. Putin and the rest of the Russians are NOT suicidal. See the next section for more details…  
  
**View**: “Putin is insane! MAD no longer applies when Russia is being run by a madman!”  
  
**Alternate Perspective**: Putin may be crazy, but he isn’t suicidal, nor are his staff or officers. Russia has been at a disadvantage since the fall of the USSR (and even before…). Coming from a position of weakness, and with the understanding that their conventional military is no match for NATO, Putin has employed a well known geopolitical strategy made famous by our very own Richard Nixon known as the “Madman Theory”. With this strategy, Putin and the Kremlin allow a narrative of an “irrational and volatile” Putin who may just ‘press the button’ if he gets too upset. This allows Russia to engage internationally with MUCH more projected power than they actually have, because the west is paralyzed into thinking that Putin has a death wish and wants to end the world.",1649418951.0,1649417301.0,t3_tyuxab,t3_tyuxab,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

I'm glad those buildings didn't get hit, but it seems like that would be an easy step to take like what the British did with the White House in the War of 1812.

However I think it's important to understand what Plato warned us of with the Allegory of the Cave (eg, echo-chambers). 

- This is what happens when the equivalent of Fox News is all you have to tune into. 

- This is the end-result of a gradual increase of pressure into oppression. 

Like North Korea, it makes it very hard to distinguish those who truly drank the Kool-aid (and make no mistake, many of us would fall for it too if it was all we knew), and those who are just pretending to be supportive lest they're ostracized or killed off. The only time Americans got a taste of this to a much lesser degree was in opposition to Vietnam or the invasion of Iraq in 2003. My family was on the dissenting side and even your own relatives would accuse you of being terrorist sympathizers. 

The thing is, we know many Russians and even many Russian soldiers alike based on western intelligence don't want to be there. But let's be clear: many of these soldiers are moving forward with a gun in their own back; in the backs of their own families. Unfortunately it only takes a handful of officers and obedient Yes-men to compel the rest of the men to fall in line... Or else. Hence why there was such an emphasis on officers and leadership at Nuremberg. 

It's in moments like this where negative sentiment like racism manifests in the same way past generations resented those like the Japanese for WWII long past its end. I'm just saying to be mindful with the blanket generalizations. 

Don't lose sight of the butcher who set this all in motion and who actively oppressed and controls what media his people see, Putin.

**Edit**: Vietnam is actually a fair example of this. Inspired or compelled American troops thinking they're saviors, get shocked into reality, eventually a portion commit war crimes of their own (e.g., My Lai Massacre). Not representative of all US forces, and not representative of those stuck in between and forced to follow orders. Also conscientious objection wasn't as severe as in Russia.

There are several ways that the conflict relates to the current Ukraine war, including some of the islands being a majority ethnic Ukrainian, and comparisons between Crimea and the Kurils. But that leads to my questions:

1. When Japan deported all the native ethnic Japanese population, where did mixed-raced or mixed-nationality people go? I know it was a small number to begin with, but they had to go somewhere. I have searched through several websites and a book that I found online, and it seems like Russia would have wanted to send them to Japan despite in some cases the people not even speaking Japanese as a mother tongue. But that isn't explicitly stated anywhere, so I'm curious.

2. Once people were deported, where did they actually settle? It has been decades so if and when the islands are properly returned to Japan, will they even be populated by the same originally indigenous people? Or will they just be a military base or something? I have found information which says that the United States has an interest in building a base in those islands if they ever return to Japan, and Japan is expected to be very happy about it if so because it guarantees security in the region. But nothing has actually said that the original inhabitants and their descendants would even be allowed to return. Before I jumped down the rabbit hole, I would have thought that the point of returning the islands would be so that the original inhabitants could live there again.

3. Since some of the islands now have large ethnically Ukrainian populations, if there ever was a change an ownership or even a referendum, considering the economic problems that Russia is going to face for the next few years or decades, what are the chances that the current inhabitants would want to stay part of Russia? Unless there is some kind of international movement, I think such a referendum is unlikely because Russia is awful, but we have seen how horribly Russia is handling the war in Ukraine so it makes me wonder what other unforeseen things will happen.

4. If a change ever happened, would Japan deport the Russian and Ukrainian population of the islands? Or would they give them the choice to continue living there?

Yes, I know this is Reddit and I probably won't get clear answers to those questions, but I wanted to pose them anyway because I'm probably not the only person to think about it, especially in context of the current events in Ukraine.

I know it would be a massive undertaking but civilians can do this as volunteers and create a new river and as they recapture more border they extend the length until there is no means to cross beside a couple points being monitored?

Rivers have been helping Ukraine to bottleneck invaders so is this feasible to stop invaders in the future?

The Russians within Russia seem to support the war but they don't believe the atrocities they hear about are real because they aren't allowed to. I have no doubt that there are Russians who believe the claims of genocide and rape and murder and support it anyway, but I doubt most do. And Russians outside of Russia certainly don't support this war.

The only reason I mention this is that I see people commenting about how terrible Russians are, and I hope they mean the Russian government and military and not the Russian people as a whole.

I think all humans are capable of committing and supporting horrible acts of violence. Every population on earth probably has at some point. There are always circumstances that lead to things like this, people don't generally wake up one day and suddenly support genocide. The only way to stop things like this in the future is to understand what causes it. I don't pretend to know why the Russian military is the way that it is, but everything has a reason behind it. The path to a peaceful world is forgiving your enemies.

I don't mean to say Ukrainians should or should be expected to. Their families are being slaughtered, it's impossible to expect them to just sit down with a Russian invader and understand why they do what they do. But we can at least try to understand while condemning at the same time. Russian soldiers are committing evil actions, and there's a reason they choose to do so. Because in the end there is always a choice, and there's always a reason anybody makes any decision good or bad, and usually you can trace their beliefs and causes of their actions back to other moments in their life.

Idk, I guess all I'm saying is that I hope this war doesn't breed hatred for Russian people, not that I think anger at them is unjustified.

Edit: are people purposely misunderstanding my comment? I never even said we should forgive Russian people. I said we should understand what drives people to do this. Is that so bad? Hate breeds more hate, just look at... Most conflicts in world history. The German people enabled genocide in the 1930s and 40s. We don't hate them now, but we don't forget or forgive those who enabled it. I don't see how we can fix what's happening now - I'm not an expert or anything.

Per a great comment earlier by u/RealUncleBuck 

“While NATO’s cornerstone treaty is the Article 5 Collective Defense, NATO is not only a ‘defensive’ organization. By definition it is a military alliance and has the capability of being used for offense / proactive missions as well. For example, NATO intervened in the Kosovo War in the 90s where they militarily forced the FR of Yugoslavia to stop the attempted genocide against Albanians. This was done without UN authorization. NATO also acted offensively against Libya, however that mission was in conjunction with UN authorization. However, both of these cases prove that NATO is not strictly a defensive organization, but has the capability to take action outside of NATO territory and apart from an Article 5 activation.”",False,1649424175.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3w9az0,,1,30,0,30,0,0,

Plan B: Give the FSB a huge budget for bribes to prepare a Quisling shadow government in Ukraine that will stage a coup if the legitimate government doesn't collapse. The FSB division given this assignment assumes Putin would never be crazy enough to actually try this plan and instead steals the entire bribe fund, and the network of Ukrainian Quislings they pretended to have is revealed to be entirely fictional.

Plan C: Take Hostomel airport early, massively airlift troops in and have them storm Kiev, which is only a short distance away. The US, having very, very thoroughly compromised Russian military communications, intercepts this plan and leaks it to the Ukrainians who heavily defend the airport, inflicting staggering losses on wave after wave of Russian paratroopers, then blow the runways so it can't be used.

Plan D: We sit on our hands on the territory already under Russian control for a month, while we wait for further orders. I'm sure the generals know what they're doing! Maybe this whole resistance thing will just blow over if we just kind of wait it out. By the way, why are all the trees around here this strange reddish color?

Whether Russia successfully or unsuccessfully invades all or part of Ukraine, the Russian people will only hear about victory from their propaganda machine. 

The murdering of innocent Ukrainians in a messy pointless war will only strengthen Ukrainian and NATO animosity and resentment towards Russia for the next generation, or longer. This in turn qualifies the messaging of the Russian propaganda machine to its citizens, that the West and European neighborhood hate Russia, and that Russian citizens are better off in Russia, ""voting"" for Putin and his henchmen who will protect them - which in turn justifies their actions in the future if another strategic military invasion is required to ""defend"" Russia from the big bad world. 

It's a closed loop and there's fuck all we can do about. Except for wiping Putin off the face of planet, and going to war with Russia to liberate them from their hellscape. But no one seems to have the balls for that, and so on and on it will go as innocent people are murdered for the geopolitical games of the powerful. 

We must not forget that the people of Russia, many of them, are not to blame for this. This is a symptom of the West not acting early enough, and allowing this madman to gain inches he should never have gained. 

Don't let our own propaganda get into your head so much that you start hating innocent people (Russians) as easily as they have been brainwashed to.

Drop the term Nazi.

It has almost no relevance here.

There are no Nazis today.  None.  Nowhere.  There are only a bunch of larper-like Nazi wannabees.

And.  don't do it.  I know you were just gonna switch to fascist.  Let me stop you right there and point out the deeper problem we need to escape.

Nazi and Hitler have become the terms used as the concept of the ultimate of Evil.  We use this as the default go-to whenever we really wish to mean ""bad"" or ""evil"".  This is sloppy.  This is lazy.  It's what led to [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law).

But, as we see so adroitly from Russia (and to a lesser degree right-wingers in the US), it is so easily misused by evildoers in a strange DARVO like or tu quoque way (no... **you** are the racist).

The solution is **not** to try to recapture the term or argue endlessly the claim that there really are Nazis in Ukraine.  The solution is to ***abandon*** this linguistic and moral-reasoning sloppiness.  ""Fascism"" is used in the same way.  The vast majority who fling this term around couldn't define it (or correctly identify it) if their life depended on it.

Instead, we need to stick with what behaviors or policies we deem to be evil.

I don't care if there were or are ""Nazis"" in Ukraine.  Ukraine did not violate national sovereignty and territorial integrity, kill thousands, bomb hospitals, rape children, etc., etc.

Russians are not ""acting like actual Nazis"".  If you cannot define the evil you deplore without referring a bunch of losers from almost a century ago, think a bit more deeply on the matter.  Russians are acting like Russians.",False,1649471836.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3zfxze,,1,25,0,25,0,0,

How much I'd like Ukraine to be inside the EU, ..  being rational, I think it's a useless effort right now and will only show weakness of the EU, and won't give the Ukrainians any good feeling about being a member of the EU. I'd like them to join the EU when the conflict is over and go in with trillions to rebuild infrastructure. 

For now.. I don't expect all of a sudden that the EU will protect it's member nations while being in an active war, this doesn't help the public opinion of Ukraine people.

Rebuilding cities? Sure, but what if Russia retakes them ? Pessimistic maybe, but let's not be optimistic yet.

Some of the stuff they say is very disturbing.

Recently Julia Ioffe [mentioned some of the Kremlin propaganda in an article](https://puck.news/never-again-again-the-history-of-putins-terror/) (paywalled):  
>It is why Ukraine’s efforts to document, with the help of international investigators, the war crimes that Russia seems to have committed in Ukraine will be largely a formality. Ukraine, along with the Netherlands and Australia, are bringing legal action against Russia for its role in shooting down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014. A Russian BUK missile exploded by the nose of the civilian airliner, and the bodies of 298 passengers and crew rained down on the sunflower fields of the Donbas. The Netherlands, which lost 193 citizens in that disaster, launched a formal investigation, and later held a news conference to make a convincing case that they had figured out who had launched the missile and how. The Russian government, meanwhile, conducted its own investigation, which spun elaborate theories that kicked the blame away from the Kremlin’s doorstep. Meanwhile, the state propaganda machine provided ever more bizarre explanations for the crash, including the invention of a Spanish flight dispatcher named Carlos and a plane pre-packed with corpses that America deliberately crashed in Ukraine to make Russia look bad. And it worked. Most Russians bought their government’s version of events and, despite legal action brought by the Netherlands and other governments, the people who shot the plane out of the sky are walking free.

>The same is already happening after Bucha. The Kremlin and Russian Foreign Ministry immediately did what they always do, predictably and cynically waving away the massacres as “fake.” Then, Russian state media, as usual, took the baton and started doing the real work, developing and disseminating alternative explanations of what happened, and thereby muddying the waters. Kremlin media is already telling its viewers that the corpses are actually those of Russians who had been shot by Ukrainians, or were not corpses at all: they have been showing footage that they say depicts the bodies in Bucha’s streets moving their hands (they’re not) or sitting down (they don’t). 

>Now that Russia is in a near total information vacuum, most Russians will inevitably believe their government and not understand why the world is so intent on hating them. Meanwhile, the Russian government is calling for an independent international investigation—that is, one dominated by Russia—that would prove the Kremlin’s lazy and ludicrous explanation (its favorite) that it was all a provokatsiya, a false flag operation. 

>Bucha is just the beginning. In Mariupol, the Ukrainian government suspects, the situation will look far worse. Meanwhile, the Kremlin seems to be laying the philosophical and moral groundwork to encourage or excuse any crimes Russian soldiers might commit in Ukraine. RIA Novosti, a Russian state media site which has in the past telegraphed the Kremlin’s thinking, published a manifesto on Sunday declaring that Russia no longer has to distinguish between the Ukrainian army and the Ukrainian people. Both are Nazis and therefore subject to legitimate “liquidation.” Not only does Ukraine have to be dismantled as a state, the piece argues, but the Ukrainian population “must live through the hardship of war and absorb this lived experience as a historical lesson and an expiation of its guilt.”

With that last part, try swapping some of the words, such as ""Nazis"" for ""Jews"" and you get this:  
Germany no longer has to distinguish between the Ukrainian army and the Jewish people. Both are Jews and therefore subject to legitimate “liquidation.” Not only does Ukraine have to be dismantled as a state, the piece argues, but the Jewish population “must live through the hardship of war and absorb this lived experience as a historical lesson and an expiation of its guilt.”

I'd even go as far as saying that I understand their slowness in reducing German imports of Russian gas and oil. 

But this does not change my perception, which is that they're doing some things with seemingly great reluctance; rather hoping that Russia pulls back and stops before Germany is nearly forced to also enact tougher sanctions. 

I get it - it's hard to change policy and attitudes you've had in place for decades. I also get it that Germans have seen diplomacy as No 1 way to reduce tensions and their immediate reaction would be to turn to diplomacy. 

But it stings, as a fellow EU member state citizen, that when Germany is asked to help with something Germany has experience with, to truly act against something Germany itself has promised to never again support, their support seems to come reluctantly and slowly. 

For those who are saying that this is just another anti-German rant pushed by pro-russian trolls: ask yourselves why are CEE countries looking towards USA so much when it comes to their security and defence? The above is why. Many countries in CEE, many citizens of these countries do not believe that Germany (and even France, which has a proper military as opposed to Germany really) would truly come to our aid, despite the fact that we're in NATO and the EU too.

First, it's very difficult to hit a target with missile strikes. Russian missiles are not that good. See if you can find pictures of airfields hit by Russian airstrikes- what you'll find is that there are craters all over the place and only one or two actually hit something of value. Another example from a few years back, kinda famous in Russian-language news- Russia launched a ballistic missile strike in Syria against a target that was 3 square miles in area. Pretty big, right?

1 Russia had pay off too many people with power to turn their backs to Ukraine, it seems like they took the money and fleed

2 besides the people they paid off, Ukraine has unveil multiple moles inside the government

3 small pro Russia movement across the country

4 Russia has put people on the ground before invading, tasked with killing high profile targets such as Zelensky

5 Ukraine pre Crimea and post Crimea

6 Zelensky factor

7 Russia becoming a wolf without teeth 

8 Putin's yes-men screwing up while he ignores the smart ones and the ones telling the truth. 


Just a few key points that matters to me, there's at least 2 Ukraine's the one before Crimea and the one after Crimea, when Russia came knocking on the door, Ukraine wasn't ready to answer the invasion, that was back in the 2014s, since then Ukraine has been training, trying to tiddy up their army and finding courage to fight for their land.

With that being said, Russia is showing a lot of flaws, their army and equipment is not on par with countries, they are lacking a lot, they never thought countries would turn on them and freeze the money, they must have thought ""we have oil and gas, their asses belongs to us"", at first this was true, but little by little countries are ignoring the red lines Russia has draw and they haven't retaliate, which has left them in a bad spot.

With multiple spies and moles, and the plans they had, it's clear they wanted a quick war, they were expecting to waltz in and people would surrender, but Ukrainians had another plan, noone expected the Zelensky factor which is.. Guy doesn't come from political background, that has allowed him to speak freely and from heart, he doesn't have the same restrictions a career politician might have to be political correct all the time, he just speaks from the heart and says clearly what's on his mind, he doesn't care if the hard truths are going to make countries ashamed of themselves.

Russia has made a big mistake by allowing their troops to do whatever the hell they want, that has given moral bullets to Ukraine to hold higher moral ground and pressure countries into acting.

With all this being said, Russia didn't want to erase Ukraine as entity, that's why they didn't target the government, because their plan was to assassinate the current government and replace it with some puppet, nothing is going according to their plan, waltz in, destroy the military buildings and make them understand Russia can erase them from the world was enough for them to land a win.",False,1649399174.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3v3d4f,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

2: Training users to effectively utilize advanced weapons systems which might involve sharing critical military intelligence secrets - if the system is destroyed but the operators are captured, that could be a major problem in a subsequent conflict.

3: Systems have to be either compatible with each other and the forces on the ground have to be trained to use them. American F-16 fighter jets are not compatible with Soviet weapons systems and replacement aircraft parts. They might not even use the same types of aviation fuel. Also, the Ukrainian pilots would have to be trained to fly the jets which do not have native Russian or Ukrainian language flight instruments and which rely on electronics systems which are much more advanced than their Russian counterparts.

Where this is going to play out is going to be interesting. World war 1 started out as simply Austria invading Serbia, and it spiraled into a global conflict. WW2 started with Germany invading Poland, and in turned into a world conflict. So will Russia attacking Ukraine, spill over into other countries as a domino effect? It’s possible. Will this turn into a Vietnam for Russia, where it’s a losing battle and they will keep fighting until the public support collapses? Maybe. Or will this turn into a frozen conflict, similar to North and South Korea, where the war never gets settled and 50 years from now there’s still trenches and low scale fighting? Maybe again.

Lend-Lease doesn't necessarily change the type of weaponry the US will send though. It's not like Zalensky can order up a bunch of F22s, or Patriot missile systems.

I'll give you a quick summary imo as to why MLP/E.Z are strong in France and the current situation of our democracy (wich is in a real bad state btw)

First I want to clarify one thing, MLP/Zemmour has nothing to do with Russia Ukraine conflict.

1/ Moderate right wing is destroyed. Sarkozy was corrupt and last election Fillon the main candidate was corrupt aswell so they broke the trust.

2/ Left wing moderate is destroyed because during F.Hollande mandate this genius decided to have a right wing policy in terms of everything except social stuff and had one of the most hated politicians (Manuel Valls). So moderate Left wing voters felt betrayed and the party called PS got destroyed.

3/ Macron who was in that government rallied what was left of PS and some moderate right wingers alongside him for his campaign. He handed the covid crisis really poorly, I mean we had one representant of the gov that literrally said masks were useless and that French people wouldn't be able to wear it correctly. He acted really arrogant towards the working class and poor people I quote him : "" at train station you meet the ones who have success and the ones that are nothing"" or ""If you want to get a job just cross the street and I find you one"". Add to that the violent repression of the yellow  vest and that there are people in france that believes in freedom of health so they had a bad view about vaccines being an obligation.

Also you have to take into account that Nato betrayed Macron with the submarines crisis wich was seen as a failure internationally.

And now you have the Mckinsey gate about Macron.

4/ So now here we are, with moderates that took huge hit and people having a real hard time believing in politics and elites of the country (rightfully so) and at the same time people like MLP and Eric Zemmour blaming all of the misery on strangers and saying that they're for the people and French glory, also they moderate their words kind of during the campaign to look more apealing / less evil.

Add to that the exhaustion of some people because it's been since Chirac that people do barrage against Far right and had to chose to the less annoying option but at the same time being betrayed by them (they took their vote for granted and it's been decades moderates feels like it's easy to win vs MLP so they do s... and don't care) and not even respecting our democracy or the people.

I'll add one thing, I don't trust MLP will win especially if there's a debate on second run because she has too some shady stuff behind the scenes. But I expect a huge amount of abstention or white votes for this run. Elites really needs to take more seriously the people because in France as we said : Play with fire and you'll get burn. The danger is that if you don't trust politicians within democracy how do you keep believing in it ?

It's both cheaper and safer to provide the Ukrainians with weapons - for now. This comes at a great cost to the Ukrainian people, of course, which we should rightly feel an immense frustration over.

Not an economist.

The initial rate increase was probably meant to combat the outflow of foreign currency,  predicted rise in inflation, and keep the ruble stable within international markets where it was still used. It’s hard to gauge how effective this was given that inflation still went up dramatically and black market rates for foreign currency are allegedly up.

This has a side effect of reducing consumer spending and discouraging investments by design since interest payments would be significant and reduction in investments would probably mean a market sell off as well - companies would have a harder time taking loans to grow and that coupled with the invasion and loss of confidence in the ruble would mean a crash in the market. The fact that they closed the market and reopened only to buying is probably due to these fears. Basically imagine if a number of short sellers hit Gazprom stock, it would be a near certain return as well as potentially collapse whatever security firm allowed the short sell as they couldn’t get loans from the central bank at reasonable rates to offset the sudden loss in capital.

The fact that they reduced interest rates, but they are still high without a real reopening of the market (that I have read about) probably hints that some combination of factors is true:

1. They need to restart the consumer/business economy and are trying to do so slowly.
2. Sanction evasion through India, China, and countries paying for gas means that while the initial shock was large, they found a way to stabilize their economy and this is taking steps to test this strategy.
3. It’s a show for external countries that they found a way to weather the sanctions even though they haven’t and it’s a way to drum up some confidence from countries that haven’t sanctioned them.

The Russian population probably is ignorant about the central bank’s interest rates - how much do Americans care about central interest rate as opposed to local prices and interest? So in some sense the interest rate news is for external parties as opposed to domestic parties. I’m sure there will be propaganda internally saying “WE BEAT DA SANCTIONS,” but in reality it’s really hard to say right now. That’s not to say they aren’t trying.

That’s all based on general information from someone who knows nothing about the Russian economy. This sort of question would be better asked someone who knows how the Russian economy works as it’s probably not 100% comparable to a “western” economy.",False,1649464897.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3yw77g,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Because of that you would keep the number of people in the know small, and you certainly wouldn't want to do it over and over.

So if it was a false flag/staged how would you do it so you could keep it secret?

1. Keep the number of people involved limited.  A false flag is easier than having a staged attack because staged means everyone involved knows and anyone in the area knows, which means dozens or even hundreds of people.  A false flag could be a small handful that know.

2. Keep independent people away from the scene.  You don't want foreigners, journalists, opposition politicians, etc anywhere near scenes like this because they can find out things to contradict your story.  You also don't want too many survivors who can similarly tell a different story than your false one.

3. Do it as few times as possible.  The more you do it, the more people who will know and the more evidence may be available to be discovered that it was fake.

So what do we see in Ukraine?

1. Large numbers of people involved, making keeping a secret harder and pretty much ruling out staged events.

2. Independent journalists and foreigners all over to cover the story up close.  Ukraine encouraging independent investigation and verification of the atrocities.  This is the exact OPPOSITE of what you would do to cover up a false flag/staged event.  You would keep out everyone except your own propaganda/intelligence operatives.  Attacks in large public places with large number of ordinary citizens and survivors/eyewitnesses to it, like this train station attack or the various city occupations?  Your odds of getting caught go way, way up.  You'd want to instead destroy something smaller where everyone dies and there are no eyewitnesses.

3. Repeated events in multiple cities.  This is multiplying the effort and the odds of being caught.  And by doing such terrible things--killing so many *of your own* people, including children?  Again, the more you do it the more it greatly increases the odds that someone will not be ok with it and will reveal it.  Especially with foreign journalists around eager for an amazing scoop like that.

So basically Ukraine is doing the exact opposite of everything you would do for false flags/staging these war crimes, and these events are not condusive at all to staged/false flags because there are too many people involved and done too many times and too many independents around.  This would strongly indicate that these events are real.

It's like the people who think the moon landings were faked.  If you were faking them then you wouldn't get thousands of people involved in the program, wouldn't have so many witnesses to the rocket launch, and you certainly wouldn't use so many outside contractors too.  Plus you would go to the moon ONCE, not six times with each time making it more likely you will get caught.

What is feasible is to set large amounts of explosive charges along the main highway/roads from Russia and Belarus, so Ukraine can destroy armor as it enters on those roads.

Also another could be to add water lines into the fields next to the road so they can turn on the faucets and turn all fields along the road into mud pits.

Then they set up their artillery miles back, post only a handful of hidden observer positions, and if the Russians are dumb enough to try another northern invasion, they can light up one of those 40 mile convoys and destroy it without needed to get close to it.

1. 'A member of the Azov Battalion' is not necessarily far-right, let alone 'a nazi' as you claimed.

2. The Ukrainian government, notably, turfed out the founding commander of the Azov Battalion after they absorbed it into the national guard-- *precisely because he was a racist cunt*.

If Finland and Sweden wants to join NATO let them. All these 3 countries wouldn't dare attack Russia unless provoked first, yet Russia is scared of their decisions?   


and that so called ""balance of influence"" if they are scared they will lose influence, why bully other countries? that will make them go far away from them as possible.  Imagine if Russia was a democratic actual-for-real-peaceful country, and their culture flourishing, very open to everyone, treats any countries nicely, I bet a lot of countries would've wanted to be friends with them or even adapt their way of life. No doubt Ukraine would've wanted to be closer to them.  I see it just like with South Korean culture, they seem to be booming in a lot of countries. Why? Because people in general love what they offer. People are interested.   Wars are so outdated. If they want allies, they need to show that they are loveable.

Eventually the British found out and began passing him carefully crafted disinformation to feed to the Germans, which they swallowed whole.

They are perma-fucked in terms of any participation in the global economy. They went scorched earth to try to protect themselves from sanctions and that will bite them back forever.

Not only that, but Zelensky has been transparent that the moment Russian troops are out of Russia, Ukraine is becoming a new Israeli state. That means mandatory military service for every male over 18, millions and millions of troops.

In addition, the military alliances formed will not be easily broken. Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will probably be extremely invested in reinforcing Ukraine the moment Russia withdraws.

Before the war, Ukraine was very likely somewhat ok with gas (still) getting transfered through their country as that gives them transit fees. I believe they stopped buying directly from Russia, but buying back after it passed their country. But eventually that is still Russian gas.

Yamal pipeline fell to zero for Germany, but the usual flow started to go back east (Poland). Yay for buying German gas I suppose.

The same weird thing probably happens as well at Rotterdam Port. Rotterdam along with Singapore and Houston are the largest energy hubs. I wonder if the energy flow gets administered by original source or just the name of those 3 countries. If I remember correctly, Arabian oil from Arabia comes here. Those ships get filled up with bunker/heating fuel and go to Singapore to unload. And from there (with perhaps some other kind of fuel) to Arabia for the next trip.

And it's easy to single out EU countries as being the only ones complicit. Surely no country outside of the EU buys EU products. I'm sorry, but you are likely paying for it as well.

Let's quit Russia and only buy from other countries which don't have the capacity yet or the EU doesn't have the capability to receive. Price will go up, EU is likely able to buy, but plenty of other countries might have a problem with the new price point after we replaced the energy supply.

(Some countries in) Europe should never have led themselves to be so dependent on 1 provider. Arabian oil embargo should have made clear why that dependency is dangerous.

As for the current case, I saw a politician from some country trying to explain that money got paid but other sanctions prevented that money to be used (effectively). Explanation should be more clear on how it's measured and if there are extra actions when it's no longer effective.

Which you're right, cutting trade with Russia won't have much of an impact because the markets were trending that way anyways.


However, in Russia's case the top imports from the US are cars and car parts, computers and other tech, medical equipment, and medicine. Russia is incapable of replacing those with domestic production, both because of other sanctions and their economy sucks, and they are unlikely to find a friendly trading partner to increase imports for those things.

The fact that America doesn't spend on other things is unrelated.  If you cut the military budget in half tomorrow, that money wouldn't go anywhere useful.  America has the ability to fund everything that everyone wants without touching the military budget.  Don't confuse ability with choice.  This isn't a binary one or the other sort of thing.

The problem in America is how America bends over backwards for corporations and the rich.  They don't pay enough tax, and they get whatever they want via lobbyists eventually.

Deficit - It's largely due to the Republicans pushing through tax cuts and not taxing the wealthy/closing loopholes appropriately. Cuts are not the only solution.

Healthcare - We already spend enough money on healthcare to give everyone great healthcare. We spend more per capita than anywhere else in the world. The structure is just wrong. It's not a money problem.

Student debt - As reminder, the median young adult has zero student debt, and those with student debt are on average significantly higher income and significantly wealthier than the average person. There are some people out there in difficult situations (primarily those who started but didn't finish college), but wiping out student debt in general is a giveaway to the well-off, not to the poor.

However, we apparently sent almost nothing to Ukraine in the past few weeks. So I guess they could live with that, as long as countries like the US, Czechia and the UK keep on doing what they do.

It's just lots and lots of bullshit takes. The truth is, it would hurt our economy in very signficant ways. Probably hundreds of thousands of jobs lost, industries gone, and so on. They don't want this because they want to win the next election. Or maybe they're afraid of right-wing parties winning the next election. And to be fair, the main issue was the previous government. It absolutely failed at ensuring our energy supply, we don't even have a single LNG terminal, even though basically every single one of our allies warned us about this. Now we can't get natural gas from countries that don't share a pipeline with us.",False,1649412397.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3vpw2j,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

It's cognitively way more expensive to evaluate and disprove something than it is to use some kind of emotional heuristic (does this information feel good? does it allow me to not have to change my mental models?), so one tactic is to supply a [constant barrage of media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood) to exhaust our ability to critically evaluate information.

Eventually, we start reacting emotionally because it's overwhelming to do anything else. 

And if the messaging we receive carefully binds our identity to a ""team"", whether it's a nation, religion, political party, cultural or ethnic group, etc., a perceived attack on the ""team"" is an attack on our extended family, or even our identity.

At that point, our emotions can be weaponized against an ""enemy"" that the manipulators have propped up. The ""enemy"" doesn't even have to make sense or be consistent, it just needs to provide a channel to resolve the cultivated feelings of fear, anger, and lack of control that threaten the individual and the group.

Because they quite literally housed them, Belarus predominantly had air-launched nukes at airbases, Kazakhstan had a lot of silos, Ukraine and Russia had a mix of both, plus bases and storage facilities for the Soviet submarine fleet.

Temporarily, Ukraine and Kazakhstan were the 3rd and 4th largest nuclear arsenals in the world, with Russia and the US taking the top spots.

Three of those nations subsequently gave up the nukes or gave them to the fourth, and signed treaties, specifically about what happens if the fourth attacked or threatened them. Guess what happened next? It's now pretty clear that all three of those nations made a very bad choice for themselves.

I imagine the same would be true in a hypothetical Russian breakup, the states that initially got nuclear weapons would be those that *geographically* this worked out for, and then things would get figured out from there.

 >Hysteria is a term used colloquially to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion. In the 19th century, hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in women. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; an interpretation of sex-related differences in stress responses. In the 20th century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness.

 >The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QSD), colloquially the Quad (sometimes erroneously written QUAD despite not being an acronym), is a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan, and United States that is maintained by talks between member countries. The dialogue was initiated in 2007 by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with the support of Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney. The dialogue was paralleled by joint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled Exercise Malabar.

I wasn't even trying to be nosey but I was 3 rows back and could hear the conversation clear as a bell over the engine noise.

It was rather impressive. They never used more than a couple pronouns or adjectives through the entire conversation. They were being intentionally vague to the point they never resolved a problem, came to a conclusion or identified their line of work. I only knew they were talking about work because of the juiciest part of the conversation (and frankly, the only part I can remember).

Lady 1, 3 rows ahead of me against the window: ""By the way, I showed them the laptop.""

Lady 2, two rows ahead, sitting to my right, not even looking up from her phone: ""Yeah? Did something come of that?""

Lady 1, also not even making eye contact or changing her tone of voice: ""No. Nothing came of it.""

Like, the entire conversation was drier and as vague as that. FOR HOURS! Not a single name or place or subject detailing their line of work came about. No food. No colors. No feelings. No names. No conflict. Nothing.

If these two weren't so damn spoiled sounding and self important, I'd have thought they were masters of code talking or spying or something.

Any and all investment that does return to Russia (and you better believe there will be, because money) will land in the hands of their wealthy oligarchs, or Putin himself. What matters is the narrative, because that is what sustains the regime. If he can bolster the narrative 'West Bad, Russia Victim', then his power remains and he can do what he wants, because it's partly based on truth. What better way to unite your people behind you than to prove that what you've been telling them for 20 years is true. How? By sowing more hatred for Russians through pointless wars and the destruction of civilians of neighboring states. Ukraine is the perfect tool for this. A non-nato country that has vague ties to Russian culture and history. An easy meal, and even more digestible when you have nuclear weapons. 

It's also why we've seen such immense response from the west in terms of weapons provision, training, and intel. It's easy too when it's a non-nato country, as there aren't any rules. It's neutral ground, a perverted proxy war maybe, and a great opportunity to set Russia back a generation or two. But as soon as it arrives on NATO soil, then we've all got a fucking problem. And the West don't want that, so it's best to keep it at bay. Strengthen alliances, as you mentioned, what better opportunity. But keep in mind what I said earlier, this strengthens Putin's position too. 

Ukraine's military might expand as you say, I bet it will in fact. An Israeli state in Ukraine proves my point though, but it'll just create a new playing field for Russia. They're playing the long game here. They will always be a threat, the unfed bear in the snow. Unless they liberate themselves. The only people who can do this without nuclear war, are the Russian people. But unfortunately they're been nerve stapled so far into submission they don't know what's true anymore.

Mostly, but not completely true.  This depends upon the elasticity of supply and the elasticity of demand.

Gas is not quite like other commodities subject to tariff because Russia doesn't have anything else to do with it.  They can't store limitless amounts, and they can't readily divert it somewhere else.  Even deciding to produce less can be hard.

> and do not directly affect the amount of revenue generated by Russia selling the gas. 

Sure.  But you're presuming that there's 0 elasticity in either gas demand or other supplies.  If you put a 25% tariff on Russian gas, you can expect gas prices to go up by less than 25%, because you can expect other supplies to be more fully utilized and for overall utilization to fall some.  It's a direct economic incentive to reduce usage and develop other supplies.  And Russia pays for a *little bit of it*.  Surely this is a better first move than just turning off the spigot.

> piling on more pain for Germany's economy

I do think one of the best things the US can do to show solidarity and to improve the overall situation is to figure out how to increase heat pump production and send units to Germany.  It won't put a huge dent in gas demand, but between that, LNG supplies, and a best effort at migration off Russian gas it maybe buys them a bit of breathing room.

> they would best be using that money up further accelerate getting off of Russian gas imports.

Which then puts a wall of solid armour between your police and the public, thus helping to sow tension and mistrust.

At the risk of palming off America's issue on somebody else, I'd say that giving that stuff to the countries that Russia is threatening, would be a viable 3rd option instead of either leaving them in a car park, or arming cops.

I do think that both Democracy and Centralisation in Russia, might not be entirely possible to combine, based on historical precedents of attempting to control sprawling multi ethnic states. 

Actually getting Ukraine would have just made it worse, so bullet dodged for both countries, in a way .

It isn't a binary choice between Confederalism and Autocracy, but there have been noticeable issues in Egypt, China, Rome, India, Russia, China again, 

where the central government is either too weak and unable to intervene in the lives of citizens, or too strong and either represses the citizenry or takes it out on another country.

.
.
.
.

Russia is a country where the majority of the governmental apparatus is concentrated in the densely populated west, leaving massive areas of land in the east that are chronically underdeveloped, where you can find settlements of people who fled there to avoid Stalin, and have been ignored ever since.

.
.
.
.

The government is quite literally too strong in one portion of the country, to the point of having a teacher arrested for saying ""war"", and too weak in  other parts, to the point where the locals don't even have TVs, or modern roads.

.
.
.

Political instability does my head in, especially in East Asia, but I think that for there to be a chance of a Democratic Russia, the Kremlin has to accept some sort of outside oversight,  such as the European Courts (yeah right), and the Eastern Republics have to be trusted to take on further devolved powers, 

because anybody other than a control freak cannot tackle their issues in real time from the wrong continent.

I get that, but I still think its a stupid idea. Because when they transition from ""natural gas""(bullshit name imo) to Hydrogen, thats already waste of 40% (or so) of the energy, to convert to hydrogen and then back to heat.

There has to be other ways to get that heat that are more efficient, and more modern in terms of future development, for instance induction heating.

Arguably, the bit that ""no longer exists"" is the MiG-31's speed capabilities in the face of the West predominantly ditching its fast nuclear-capable aircraft. The B-52 is not as slow as it looks, but most of NATO's really fast or really high-altitude bombers, the kinds of things you need a fast interceptor for, are retired. UK no longer flies the V-bombers, or the Canberra, which has an *insanely* high maximum altitude, France has retired the supersonic Mirage IV, and the US has retired the FB-111, has retired almost all of its nuclear-capable supersonic and transsonic fighter-bombers (like the F4 Phantom, the Thud and the F14) and is phasing out the Lancer.",False,1649436194.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3x3q41,,3,5,0,5,0,0,

a6eabe054086acb2122a1ec1bdfd6e38,tyuxab,i3x0di3,"Honestly? I would keep my head down, and give my platitudes so as not to arouse suspicion. I would find a secure way to download anarchist cookbook, and other ied instructions without arousing suspicion. I would scout out farms that have large stores of ammonium nitrate, and find the ones easiest to steal from. I would steal as much as I could, probably from a couple farms and store them in dry bags down an abandoned logging road under a camp tarp. I would make bombs optimized to take out roads, bridges and railways. I would find locations fairly deep into the country from satellite that are critical, but difficult to gaurd or wouldn't be thought of. I would drive around these areas for a while disguised as a delivery driver with multiple dash cams  and higher quality cams.

Then would analyze the footage at home offline, and explore open source info about the type of infrastructure. If I could locate engineering material about a bridge, railway or pipeline in targeting, It could give me some critical insight into what I should target. I would park in a semi public area a km or so away or take public transport, and walk my dog in that direction to scout the area. 


I would then try to colour match whatever I'm planting the bomb with paint, and try to discover what it should be placed against to maximize damage. If a bridge, I would find a location upstream or upstream where I can walk along riverbed at night. Then I would put twice as many explosives as I think I need, and place against support. Depending on remoteness, I may spend a few hours trying to drill into the support columns if no one is around. I put charges close enough to eachother only one needs to go off for them all to set off. I would then place a rust/rust coloured painted broken looking fuel drum at an angle nearby as close to explosives as possible, and disguise it as trash. I would run a small hose into the barrel about a hundred meters up the riverbank in the bushline and pump diesel into it over a few days in small amounts. Ideally, I would have done this do a few railways, bridges and pipelines over a month or so, having them all prepped and only needing the charges to be ready. I would set them to go off at least 12 - 24 hours later at 3.19 am local time. 

By now hopefully I have a bridge or two rigged. I would also make thermite magnesium paste and make long cords of it like beads on string. I would tape these onto railway tracks, metal supports, and critical infrastructure military uses. This would be easier to repair and do less damage but would make military worried that anything they use could be compromised in structural integrity.

I would double check serial numbers and identifiable things on any materials I leave(most would be stolen or self made like aluminum powder and iron oxide, would make sure to steal the bleach for it), then rig to blow, toss my airplane mode burner phone or microwave it, and start from square one on a totally different target with a different set d tactics. I would probably try obtaining some gallium before all of this in as much discrete amounts as possible, and start looking for critical logistics that somehow use aluminim  where the public could conceivably access locations. I doubt I would get close enough to aircraft, but I could potentially make UAV balloons that could drop a bit of gallium and timed firecrackers that could destroy any critical infrastructure that relys on aluminum. I could however target powerlines leading to military installations from long distances, even just stressing surface of supports way into wilderness and painting some galium onto them. A few days later, windstorm would come along and knock over twelve high voltage transmission lines. All theoretical of course.

Even if a country is in NATO we can see their worries everytime they donate military vehicles that are currently in use but are greatly needed by Ukraine.

Like the Polish keep requesting for another fighter planes to be able to send their MiGs. Or Slovakia ,with them receiving Patriot systems as replacement for AA.

But those worries are not indicative of a lack of trust because every country needs to have the infrastructure to defend themselves in the case of an invasion, as is it impossible to send help immediately.

Now what would happen, no one really knows, but the chaos would be unimaginable. Even EU would be in danger because everyone would look over their shoulder. We would see increase of military budgets everywhere as it would be proved that the alliance has no value.

Still, that doesn't directly affect Russia and reduce the amount of revenue they receive.  It will indirectly affect them by reducing demand somewhat which in addition to lowering the amount they're exporting it will also reduce much they get per BTU due to their supply inelasticity, but I doubt by 25%.  Russia's result would be secondary effects driven by directly levying a cost on the consumers, and all consumers at that.

I say so consumers because it also greatly increases the price of gas that isn't coming from Russia.  That non-Russian supply we can safely assume is basically non-elastic as they'll be producing whatever the heck they can, flat out due to the pricing action that has already occurred.  So if you're in Spain and can see the LNG terminals from your home and none of the gas you consume is sourced from Russia then a 25% German tarrif will still increase the price you pay for gas shipped in from the US, Nigeria, and Dubai.

If you were to place a tariff you'd also have to tax excess profits for the gas suppliers, it seems like the only sane thing to do.  But do know that it will burn through political will in the general population and elections will start to hinge on continuing sanctions.  Some of them will inevitably go the other way, particularly the further from Russia they are.

And yes, I too am a big fan of heat pumps.  I see them as the low hanging fruit for much of Europe's path out of this.  The more heat pumps that can be utilized for heating both living spaces as well as providing hot water then the better this situation will be from a variety of perspectives.  Even if the heat pump is being driven by electricity coming from a gas fired power plant they are still a positive multiplier.  The net result is that a real world heat pump will still use less gas overall than the same had directly burning in a theoretical perfectly efficient, and that ignores the fact they the power grid fuel mix is obviously not 100% gas as well.",False,1649441106.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3xa03o,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

not exactly, srbms and cruise are mostly first strike weapons and as long as you are ...well, striking first, only a handful can be stopped and that is with on target defenses mostly.

the real problematic ones are anti-ballistic sites shooting missiles that aim to intercept ICBMs on launch and before they leave the atmosphere, when they are virtually defenseless. to achieve that, not only they have to be really fucking fast, but also be really fucking close to the launch sites, aka near the Russian border.

the more of these sites around Russia, the less optimal terrain to put the ICBM launchers there is, and the more predictable the routes of the *rest* of the ICBMs becomes.

this particular type works REALLY well in combination with first strike weapons as the aggressor, even better than in defense.

> The bit they seem to miss is why NATO might be so keen on putting defensive systems like that in place, especially when NATO is not looking to put offensive systems in place and nor is Russia investing in missile defence systems on that border.

that's the thing, those *sound* defensive but in reality they work better when you are attacking by shutting down your enemy last ditch defense. if they shoot first the time window to intercept before leaving the atmosphere gets waaayyy smaller.

> The reason is that Russia is the perceived aggressor. NATO doesn't want to fight it, it just also doesn't want Russia to attack.

from NATO point of view? sure. from Russia's point of view that exactly the opposite, as NATO is the one surrounding them.
you need to keep an eye on both points of view to understand why things happen.
> 
> Russia was given offers to join NATO, to collaborate, to build trust, they shut down every offer. If you constantly push someone away and act aggressive, is it really that unreasonable that they might take defensive steps?

you know that's not exactly true, right?

1. A meets with B
2. A meets with C
3. A meets with D
4. A meets with E
5. A calls a meeting with B and C, but D is an ""enemy"" so he's not invited to the meeting.
6. A calls a meeting with C, D, and E, but ""B"" is an ""enemy"" so he's not invited.
7. Finally you vote, and hopefully A, B, C, D and E all vote together on the same thing.

A lot of these meetings are greased with restaurants, golf games, tennis matches, and the like. They're basically glorified socializing and spending money, but that's how you get people together and agreeing to do things.

Sure it does.  Say Russia supplies 30% of German gas:

* If Russia doesn't blink at all and holds the line perfectly on gas prices in response to a 25% tariff-- gas prices go up 25%, maybe usage falls 10%, and 1/3rd of Russia's exports evaporate.  Maybe better than this: this assumes suppliers can't find more gas when prices are 25% higher.
* If Russia lets thing settle to a market price, maybe gas prices go up 15%.  Usage falls a little less-- maybe 5%.  Russia exports 5/6th the normal amount of gas they'd export, and gets 92% of the price they're used to-- or about 77% of the amount of gas revenues they had before.  Still better than 67% in the other scenario.

> If you were to place a tariff you'd also have to tax excess profits for the gas suppliers, it seems like the only sane thing to do.

If you tariff the Russians, and then tax windfall profits for other gas suppliers, it's just a tax on gas with more steps.  I do not think this is advised for multiple reasons.

It's rather telling that you attempt to link Zelensky with Putin and Xi, who are known dictators. Zelensky was fairly elected in a democratic election, and if he chooses to run again and the voters don't approve of him, they'll vote him back out.

The Ukrainians have already revolted and thrown out one puppet government. Do you really think they would have any problem doing the same to Zelensky, should he attempt to establish a dictatorship?

The Ukrainians want to join the EU. The EU has standards that a country must meet before being accepted. Zelensky was elected to put them on that path. The war intervened - a war that was, at least partly, *started* because of Ukraine's desire to join the EU.

It is extremely clear that Ukraine has a big problem with Russian collaborators, saboteurs, and traitors. Their history, and information coming from inside Russia, guarantees this to be the case. Even if mistakes were made and some people unjustly apprehended and incarcerated, it's not like they were stood up against a wall and shot.

>How did they take Kherson? “Stupidity or betrayal, perhaps both,” says Andrey Gordeev, former governor of the Kherson region:

>So we have four lines of defense. The first is the isthmus between the Kherson region and the Crimea, it should have been completely mined. And by the way, they told me that a week before the attack, some dick cleared it.

>Next are the border guards, but the task of the border guards is not to engage in battle, but to see the fact of aggression, give a signal and retreat, move back, and so on. Then comes our irrigation system. Irrigation system - it was designed in the Soviet Union by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Agriculture. The structure itself - as it were, the shape of the channel - does not provide for its crossing by any mode of transport. In any case, this is a complication of movement. That is, the logic is as follows: bridges explode, they all stop, and our artillery simply destroys them, otherwise.

>Then the third line of defense is the Dnieper River itself. The Dnieper, the Antonovsky bridge, is held to the last, if anything, it explodes, and Kherson, as it were, is out of hostilities altogether, there is no bridge, we only guard the water line. Whoever crosses it, that Dnieper.

>And the last line of defense is the Kakhovka bridgehead. New Kakhovka is being evacuated, people are being evicted there, and the Kakhovka bridgehead is being held. Redoubts and caponiers are made there. All this takes a day. These days we had to stop them at the entrance. Did not work out.

>The current governor, Gennady Laguta, according to his colleagues, on the first day of the war put the keys on the mayor's table with the words: ""I'm not participating in this,"" and left the region. Together with him, on the first day of the war, the leadership of the police, the prosecutor's office, and the courts left, and a little later, the SBU officers were evacuated.",False,1649445720.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3xsxny,,6,2,0,2,0,0,

Spoken with such authority and certainty! I didn't know you were in Russia's nuclear chain of command!

As the previous poster said, Russia has been very vague about what will cause a nuclear response. Based on their words, they should have already launched a few. By your own description, they aren't playing by the rules of MAD, where they should make a very clear red line, and not allow it to be passed.

They have most recently said it is at the point of ""existential threat"" that they would use them, which for a sane nation would be an invasion of their sovereign territory. But Russia has not defined it. In fact, they have said that various things that USA and Europe are already doing, are in fact existential threats.

Of course, assuming they are not a sane nation, they may consider an attack in Ukraine to be an invasion. But, there is currently no clear red line.

While I understand that you believe, very very strongly, that NATO boots or jets in Ukraine would immediately trigger a nuclear strike, stating it as an absolute certainty is at best overconfident.

Edit: oh, and even the clearly stated rules of nuclear doctrine cannot really be trusted. You really think that today's USA would ever use a nuclear weapon to ""rapidly end a war on favorable terms""? You think they ever would have?

If you get half your gas from a big pipeline running to Russia and you have no way to replace that with some other sources, that's energy dependence.   And if you send billions of dollars / month to pay for that, then that helps prop up the country getting the money.

If you get 16% of your uranium from Russia when you could  instead get the uranium from somewhere else, and even if you were cut off, it would make no difference because you could turn to alternative suppliers in time, then it's not at all the same thing.

You're showing your ignorance there.  ICBMs *are* hypersonic.  They go into sub-orbital trajectory.  They cannot be intercepted.  A capability they've had since the 60s.  There is no advanced monitoring of the Russian command and control chain.  We have a 20 minute-ish warning when the missile has already been launched and detected by our satellites.  Once airborne, we can't stop it.  We do not have advanced warning *prior* to a launch.  That was part of what made MAD MAD.  Mutually Assured Destruction.  Both sides couldn't detect or stop the other from launching a nuke.  What each side *could* do though is respond fast enough that a counter launch could be initiated before the first nukes hit.

>Let me ask you another question: if Russian ambitions are unchecked, what makes you think they stop.with Ukraine? If they can invade anyone they want, why not take Alaska? There are more people in most Ukranian cities than there are in the wholenof Alaska. Would we really risk nuclear war to keep them from taking it?

First, they aren't unchecked.  We're providing billions of dollars and equipment, not to mention intelligence to Ukraine.  So what *will* stop Russia?  One word.  NATO.  That's what.  Russia knows it can't take on NATO and trying to do so essentially is activating Mutually Assured Destruction.  Why do you think Putin attacked when he did?  Before Ukraine could join NATO and would then be untouchable. 

>Or Moldova? Or Lithuania? Finland? Poland? Georgia?

Poland is NATO.  So they're protected.  The rest? Russia can go in and attack them like Ukraine and there is only so much we can do about it.

That's not an argument.  You're simply asserting a conclusion.  

>The new missiles would be the threat but so far they have had one successful launch.

Those new hypersonic missiles you're referring too are primarily aimed at aircraft carriers.  They are not intercontinental to my knowledge.  And even if they were, they're not needed to attack the US.  Russia has had the capability to nuke the US for decades and their existing, decade old nuclear capabilities are *still* capable enough to hit cities with no ability to stop them. Even if the vast majority of them are in disrepair and not operating.  It only takes one to annihilate New York city for instance and then tens of millions die in seconds.

>And what's the difference between NATO and non NATO? At this point peaceniks like you would be arguing that it's just Alaska. It's just the Sudetenland. It's just Poland. Not worth Russia maybe getting a nuke forty feet into the air before it detonate

A lot.  Its a big bright line.  You're now just throwing out ad hominem attacks and calling me names.  NATO article 5 is the deterrent.  So no.  ""peaceniks"" like me (whatever that means) are *not* arguing ""its just Alaska"".  You're now strawmanning what I'm saying and putting words in my mouth I haven't said.

If Russia sends a single russian soldier across the border of ANY NATO country, that should immediately result in the total and unwavering response of the entire brunt of NATO's military instantly.  Strong enough for you?

>So every single non NATO country can look forward to receiving a genocide in the next ten years.

Why is Finland and Sweden are now considering joining NATO?  Because NATO works and is the protection.

I agree and its not worth risking it.  You do not roll the dice when it comes to nuclear weapons.  You do not risk existential consequences.

>Currently Putin is counting on that west fears this escalation enough to stay out of Ukraine. He is already rolling the dice and the west is folding instead of calling.

Putin already miscalculated the response from the west.  He absolutely did not anticipate the response from the US and Europe to assist Ukraine and heavily sanction Russia.   Russia is taking heavy losses.  Putin was expecting Kyiv to fall within days and have a victory parade through Independence Square.   So no, you're wrong in your categorization that the west is folding.  Far from it.",False,1649433428.0,t3_tyuxab,t1_i3wxafu,,5,1,0,1,0,0,
