Obviously Ukraine would take out those 40 mile long columns if and when they could. Since they are likely more defended than before as Russia is shifting their strategy and tactics and finally starting to defend their supply lines its not as open hunting season like it was for the drones.        
The Bayraktars will be lurking just out of the range of these systems. The Pantsirs likely get moved around a lot because they are important high value targets.

This is pretty much what happened in the recent Azerbaijan/Armenia conflict. The Bayraktars would find holes in the Pantsir defense when getting moved, destroyed or jammed and move in to quickly destroy a bunch of tanks and strategic targets.

Russia's 17-mile convoy is **thwarted** on the road to Kyiv

Invaders' push towards the capital halted after column is ambushed by Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes

The satellite images showed a vast Russian convoy bogged down on the road to Kyiv.

Military experts said the column stretching up to 17 miles was a sitting duck for Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes. About 20 miles from where it was last spotted, the Russian advance appeared to have hit a wall.

In Bucha, 15 miles north-west of Kyiv, images posted online showed the bloody aftermath of one of the most brutal ambushes and firefights of the five-day-old war.

The evidence of the fight it faced was highlighted by mobile phone footage of the mangled wreckage of tanks and armoured personnel carriers in Bucha’s residential quarter.

**About 15 vehicles had been destroyed along with much of a half-mile section of the street.** Trees and houses that lined the road had disappeared in the explosions.

“Look what they did to my home, but we gave as good as we got and now all that’s left of the invader is spare parts,” said one resident, giving a running commentary on mobile phone footage in reference to the remnants of tanks and other Russian kit. He could have been talking about body parts, too. Other videos showed the corpses of Russian troops.

Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector \[houses\] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.” Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Credit: Emilio Morenatti

British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.

In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”

Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.

The north-west route into Kyiv from the Belarus border via the wastelands of the radioactive Chernobyl nuclear power plant had been key to Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a speedy end to a conflict that threatens to drag on for weeks, maybe longer.

Russia’s military leaders had planned a lightning attack by seizing control of Hostomel airport and the spot where the convoy was wiped out. Special forces had claimed control of the airfield in the first hours of fighting, sending in attack helicopters to offer air support for the ground forces.

The plan had been to bolster numbers by flying in airborne troops on huge Ilyushin IL-76 transporters before making a direct attack on Kyiv’s seat of power, capturing President Volodymyr Zelensky, overthrowing his government and putting in its place a puppet regime.

But the battle for Hostomel was lost by Russia and Ukraine retains control. At least one IL-76 plane, thought to be carrying about 100 Russian special forces troops, was shot down before it could land. Satellite images that emerged on Monday showed damage to the airfield with what appeared to be large craters in the runway that will prevent Russia from using it, even if it managed to wrestle it back from Ukraine in the coming, critical few days.

With Hostomel off limits, Russian convoys remain easy targets on the road to Kyiv. Along the route, Ukraine troops have launched ambushes and civilians have put in place blockades to slow the advance.

One video posted on Monday showed three middle-aged Ukrainian civilians building a makeshift military barricade, piling hundreds of rubber tyres and sandbags as well as metal barricades 10ft high while about a quarter of a mile away a Russian convoy has halted on a bridge.

He didn't entertain Putins fiction in order to take the path of least resistance and that took great foresight on his part.

3a2814671e48334992e67903a8b5ef82,t3uanp,hyul1mf,">  The trial of Alexei Navalny continued after a weekend break. Today was the sixth day. Here is how it went, it was quite spectacular. 
> 
> At the start of the day, the press secretary of the court warned everyone that the journalists won’t be able to see a certain part of today’s session. Apparently, some unannounced secret witness was going to testify today.
> 
> A screen was installed in the improvised courtroom. Many thought that this was done for one of the witnesses in the fraud case, entrepreneur Vyacheslav Kuzin. He is currently under house arrest for his past banking activities and would need to testify via a video call.
> 
> Today’s first witness was Yulia Stadnichuk. According to her, she read about Navalny’s previous trial in 2021 and got deeply insulted by his words towards the court and the judge. Stadnichuk read everything from a paper she had with her - even her answers to Navalny’s questions.
> 
> The next witness was Vyacheslav Snegirev, a forensic expert who conducted an expertise on the fraud case. This formally independent expert personally participated in the recording of evidence onto discs before analysing this evidence, but he saw absolutely nothing wrong with it.
> 
> Navalny asked Snegirev directly how much money, according to the expertise, he and his family have received from the Foundation. “Well, zero, it seems” - answered the expert. “So why am I being trialled then?” - Navalny asked. The judge dismissed the question.
> 
> The court put our investigation about Russian propagandists () on the screen. During a cutaway with Vladimir Solovyov camping around, two of the three bailiffs laughed together with Navalny. The third bailiff kept a straight face.
> 
> The person that the prosecution wanted to question via video call today turned out to be Vitaly Kostenko, one of the two bogus witnesses in the fraud case. The prosecutor cited Kostenko’s poor health, but it’s obvious that they were ashamed to bring him into court in person.
> 
> Navalny’s lawyers protested - the acoustics of the courtroom wouldn’t allow everyone to hear Kostenko clearly, and the ban on technical devices would make proper defence practically impossible.The judge dismissed the protest.
> 
> Kostenko, who lives near St. Petersburg, was brought to another court closer to him to be questioned from there through a video conference call. He couldn’t hear anything the judge was saying, so her colleague in the other courtroom repeated every question to him
> 
> Kostenko allegedly filed a request to make the court session closed - he allegedly feared that Navalny’s supporters may disclose his personal data, which would create a threat to his health and safety.
> 
> The sound quality of the conference call was abysmal, the court session turned into a shouting match. Journalists could make out two phrases that Kostenko shouted: “I don’t remember anything!” and “I have no claims!”
> 
> Kostenko shouted that he wants the session to remain open. The judge and the prosecutor desperately tried to convince Kostenko that he needs to be questioned behind closed doors, so that no one hears his testimony. Navalny laughed.
> 
> Kostenko claimed that his criminal complaint against Navalny was written not by him, but by lawyer Ilya Remeslo. The request to classify his questioning wasn’t written by him either - the signature on it didn’t match Kostenko’s signature on the interrogation protocol.
> 
> The court finally decided to keep the session open. The prosecutor asked whether the name “Anti-Corruption Foundation” tells Kostenko anything. He answered: “No”.
> 
> Navalny: “Did you transfer the money to me personally? Or to Volkov?”
> 
> Kostenko: “Yes, yes, to you personally. Or to Volkov. I don’t remember”
> 
> Navalny: “Did Volkov return you the money?”
> 
> Kostenko: “Yes”
> 
> Navalny: “So did I steal any money from you?”
> 
> Kostenko: “I wouldn’t say so”
> 
> In his 2021 testimony, Kostenko claimed that he had watched a lot of Navalny’s anti-corruption videos and mistrusted him. When asked where he saw these videos, he said “On the TV, most probably on Channel One”. It soon became clear that he hadn't seen any of them.
> 
> The prosecutor insisted on reading out the testimony that Kostenko allegedly gave to the investigator in 2021. “We will now read what you said earlier, and then we will ask clarifying questions, so listen carefully and tell me if you don’t hear something!” - she said to him.
> 
> The judge and the prosecutor tortured the old man with endless questions, trying to squeeze the “correct” answers out of him. He mostly answered “I don’t know” or “I don’t remember”. At one point, he pleaded: “Please, I just want all this to end”.
> 
> The court summoned the next witness, Kostenko’s wife Vera. Unlike her husband, she came to the colony in person. She spoke clearly and confidently, but when asked whether she knows anything about the Anti-Corruption Foundation, she also said “No”.
> 
> Vera was much more eager to slander Navalny than Vitaly. She said that her husband learns all the news from her, and she was the one who told him about Alexei. However, she also failed to explain where Kostenko got the non-public account number of the Foundation from.
> 
> Kostenko explained that Ilya Remeslo merely helped her and her husband testify, and the investigator wrote down everything they said. It is obvious though that their testimonies had been written for them.
> 
> This whole farcical trial is crumbling before our eyes. The witnesses refuse to testify, the evidence is nonexistent. Stop this nonsense right now. Free Navalny.

On BTV, she reiterated that no weapons had been exported to Ukraine, and there had been no official request for such a thing.

Hi! I'm going to try my best to answer your question. Please don't be stressed. These things are beyond your control and you will get through. 

Right now this is a Putin vs. Ukraine conflict. Putins Russia is stating they want demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine which is an excuse as Russia wants the old USSR / Imperial Russia back.

To talk about world wars we have to talk about NATO, what it is and what it means. It's basically an I've got your back treaty when it comes to wars. If a country is in NATO the other member nations come to their aide if they're attacked by a non nato country. 

Ukraine is not in NATO. Therefore NATO won't intervene. 

If Russia attacks a NATO nation, like Poland then all of NATO will come to defend that country. At that point it would be Russia vs NATO and it's allies. This would be what most would see as WW3 territory.

We have a dictator with a declared [irredentist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irredentism) worldview who appears to no longer be listening to reason. 

 He has invaded a neighboring sovereign country in Europe with [thinly veiled threats](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-threatens-finland-sweden-nato-ukraine-invasion-1682715) to invade others if his unreasonable demands are not met. 

We have a West that, while increasingly unified, is reticent to engage in direct military confrontation. 

We have a United States with a public that [does not want to get into a war](https://apnorc.org/projects/americas-role-in-the-russia-and-ukraine-situation/) in Europe.

Here is the math on the convoy. (Confirmed 40 miles long)

One mile = 5,280’

Average truck/tank length = 18’

Average distance between vehicles = 8’, but let’s assume 20’ to account for larger random air-attack gaps in the convoy

293 vehicles per mile if it was single file and no space between vehicles

138 vehicles per mile assuming 20’ gap between vehicles

UPDATED CONVOY NUMBERS BASED ON NEW SATELLITE IMAGERY

Looks like a majority of the convoy is single file, and there are some randomly spaced larger gaps between vehicles.

Here is the math on the convoy. (Confirmed 40 miles long)

One mile = 5,280’

Average truck/tank length = 18’

Average distance between vehicles = 8’, but let’s assume 20’ to account for larger random air-attack gaps in the convoy

293 vehicles per mile if it was single file and no space between vehicles

138 vehicles per mile assuming 20’ gap between vehicles

~138 vehicles x 40 miles = 5,520 VEHICLES

[https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1498359051859734533?cxt=HHwWisC5gc\_nnsspAAAA](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1498359051859734533?cxt=HHwWisC5gc_nnsspAAAA)

Btw before before start spamming me with russian ww3 propaganda keep in mind three things:

1. A no fly zone doesn't mean that any plane that enters it gets shot down automatically.  They can also be escorted. Unless people forget every single week for years Russian and Chinese jets unlawfully crossed borders of different countries like UK, Poland, Sweden and Taiwan and they never got shot down they just got escorted. The national territory of a country is a de facto no fly zone for unauthorized military jets and any country could shoot any foreign military jet on its territory that it wants. It doesn't because no one wants to escalate a situation.
2. WW3 is far more disadvantageous for Putin than it is for NATO and he admitted it as such multiple times in interviews. Moreover, Putin no matter how crazy he is he still follows conservative Russian and Soviet rules. He knows for a fact that nukes being used will mean the end of Russia and just like Stalin, Khruscev and Brejnev before him he will just posture and not use them. Heck Khruscev sent nuclear subs on the coast of the usa and they still weren't used so no, nukes are very very unlikely to be used in any scenario.
3. Putin himself has admitted that the Russian nuclear doctrine only allows the usage of nukes in two cases: if either Russia gets attacked with nukes or if someone tries to take territory away from Russia and a no fly zone wouldn't contradict any of these principles. Heck a full NATO campaign in Ukraine wouldn't contradict any of these principles.

So before people go ""omg lets just allow Putin to kill hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and raze Ukrainian cities because otherwise nukes omg"" try researching what a no fly zone actually means and what the rules of nuclear engagement actually are.

A no fly zone will simply mean NATO jets will be on the skies of Ukraine and that neither Russian nor Ukrainians jets will fly in that zone which will give the Ukrainians an advantage. Yeah Russia jets will troll and harrass NATO jets and will enter the no fly zone and will get escorted just as they have been escorted for years.",False,1646095898.0,t3_t3uanp,t3_t3uanp,,0,-3,0,-3,0,0,

Russia's 17-mile convoy is thwarted on the road to Kyiv  
  
Invaders' push towards the capital halted after column is ambushed by Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes  
  
The satellite images showed a vast Russian convoy bogged down on the road to Kyiv.  
  
Military experts said the column stretching up to 17 miles was a sitting duck for Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes. About 20 miles from where it was last spotted, the Russian advance appeared to have hit a wall.  
  
In Bucha, 15 miles north-west of Kyiv, images posted online showed the bloody aftermath of one of the most brutal ambushes and firefights of the five-day-old war.  
  
 The evidence of the fight it faced was highlighted by mobile phone footage of the mangled wreckage of tanks and armoured personnel carriers in Bucha’s residential quarter.  
  
About 15 vehicles had been destroyed along with much of a half-mile section of the street. Trees and houses that lined the road had disappeared in the explosions.  
  
“Look what they did to my home, but we gave as good as we got and now all that’s left of the invader is spare parts,” said one resident, giving a running commentary on mobile phone footage in reference to the remnants of tanks and other Russian kit. He could have been talking about body parts, too. Other videos showed the corpses of Russian troops.  
  
Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector \[houses\] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.” Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Credit: Emilio Morenatti  
  
British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.  
  
In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”  
  
Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.  
  
The north-west route into Kyiv from the Belarus border via the wastelands of the radioactive Chernobyl nuclear power plant had been key to Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a speedy end to a conflict that threatens to drag on for weeks, maybe longer.

Russia’s military leaders had planned a lightning attack by seizing control of Hostomel airport and the spot where the convoy was wiped out. Special forces had claimed control of the airfield in the first hours of fighting, sending in attack helicopters to offer air support for the ground forces.  
  
The plan had been to bolster numbers by flying in airborne troops on huge Ilyushin IL-76 transporters before making a direct attack on Kyiv’s seat of power, capturing President Volodymyr Zelensky, overthrowing his government and putting in its place a puppet regime.  
  
But the battle for Hostomel was lost by Russia and Ukraine retains control. At least one IL-76 plane, thought to be carrying about 100 Russian special forces troops, was shot down before it could land. Satellite images that emerged on Monday showed damage to the airfield with what appeared to be large craters in the runway that will prevent Russia from using it, even if it managed to wrestle it back from Ukraine in the coming, critical few days.  
  
With Hostomel off limits, Russian convoys remain easy targets on the road to Kyiv. Along the route, Ukraine troops have launched ambushes and civilians have put in place blockades to slow the advance.  
  
One video posted on Monday showed three middle-aged Ukrainian civilians building a makeshift military barricade, piling hundreds of rubber tyres and sandbags as well as metal barricades 10ft high while about a quarter of a mile away a Russian convoy has halted on a bridge. Spikes were scattered to frustrate troop-carrying trucks and fuel tankers. The makeshift barricade was enough to make the Russian commander order a halt.",False,1646095277.0,t3_t3uanp,t1_hyumzaj,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

The only realistic way Ukraine gets out of this is by holding on until Russia runs out of supplies and their economy collapses, or someone miraculously offs Putin.   Many leaked reports and intel evaluations say that Russia only has enough missiles and resources to sustain about 10 days of full scale conflict.  They have little ability to replace lost materiel, as many of their raw material sources are now blocked.  It's entirely a game of Ukraine and sanctions bleeding Russia dry while Russia grinds Ukraine into dust.

Russia's 17-mile convoy is thwarted on the road to Kyiv  
  
Invaders' push towards the capital halted after column is ambushed by Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes  
  
The satellite images showed a vast Russian convoy bogged down on the road to Kyiv.  
  
Military experts said the column stretching up to 17 miles was a sitting duck for Ukrainian artillery and drone strikes. About 20 miles from where it was last spotted, the Russian advance appeared to have hit a wall.  
  
In Bucha, 15 miles north-west of Kyiv, images posted online showed the bloody aftermath of one of the most brutal ambushes and firefights of the five-day-old war.  
  
the evidence of the fight it faced was highlighted by mobile phone footage of the mangled wreckage of tanks and armoured personnel carriers in Bucha’s residential quarter.  
  
About 15 vehicles had been destroyed along with much of a half-mile section of the street. Trees and houses that lined the road had disappeared in the explosions.  
  
“Look what they did to my home, but we gave as good as we got and now all that’s left of the invader is spare parts,” said one resident, giving a running commentary on mobile phone footage in reference to the remnants of tanks and other Russian kit. He could have been talking about body parts, too. Other videos showed the corpses of Russian troops.  
  
Anatolii Fedoruk, the mayor of Bucha, celebrated the defeat even as he surveyed the destruction: “The armed forces of Ukraine stopped the enemy’s column… These are the results of their invasion and the work of our armed forces. Unfortunately, the private sector \[houses\] also received damage, but we will rebuild. Wishing health to our armed forces who have worked very well. Everything will be Ukraine.” Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Vehicle-blocking measures have been put in place on the road to Kyiv Credit: Emilio Morenatti  
  
British defence intelligence issued its own update on Monday, suggesting Russian forces had become immobilised. “The bulk of Putin’s ground forces remain more than 30km to the north of Kyiv, their advance having been slowed by Ukrainian forces defending Hostomel airfield, a key Russian objective for day one of the conflict,” it said.  
  
In its assessment, the MoD added: “Logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance continues to frustrate the Russian advance.”  
  
Further down the road from Bucha, Ukrainian forces used Western-supplied anti-tank missiles to destroy another Russian convoy on a bridge that serves a main route into Kyiv. The Russian column had been obliterated and corpses lay at the side of the road. Ukrainian officials briefed CNN that they were “enthused by the victory on the bridge”.  
  
The north-west route into Kyiv from the Belarus border via the wastelands of the radioactive Chernobyl nuclear power plant had been key to Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a speedy end to a conflict that threatens to drag on for weeks, maybe longer.

Russia’s military leaders had planned a lightning attack by seizing control of Hostomel airport and the spot where the convoy was wiped out. Special forces had claimed control of the airfield in the first hours of fighting, sending in attack helicopters to offer air support for the ground forces.  
  
The plan had been to bolster numbers by flying in airborne troops on huge Ilyushin IL-76 transporters before making a direct attack on Kyiv’s seat of power, capturing President Volodymyr Zelensky, overthrowing his government and putting in its place a puppet regime.  
  
But the battle for Hostomel was lost by Russia and Ukraine retains control. At least one IL-76 plane, thought to be carrying about 100 Russian special forces troops, was shot down before it could land. Satellite images that emerged on Monday showed damage to the airfield with what appeared to be large craters in the runway that will prevent Russia from using it, even if it managed to wrestle it back from Ukraine in the coming, critical few days.  
  
With Hostomel off limits, Russian convoys remain easy targets on the road to Kyiv. Along the route, Ukraine troops have launched ambushes and civilians have put in place blockades to slow the advance.  
  
One video posted on Monday showed three middle-aged Ukrainian civilians building a makeshift military barricade, piling hundreds of rubber tyres and sandbags as well as metal barricades 10ft high while about a quarter of a mile away a Russian convoy has halted on a bridge. Spikes were scattered to frustrate troop-carrying trucks and fuel tankers.

This is primarily due to how hard it is to prove and made a solid case about another nation's domestic politics. It really isn't anyone's business, except the UN perhaps, what goes on domestically, so it's a lot harder to get anything done. Any action has to go through the UN, which is slow as it's primary role to maintain global cooperation, not push an agenda or politics. Crimes against humanity is wrong, but the UN must act with as much impartiality, and sometimes ignorance, as to maintain cooperation.

What makes Russia's actions so serious is the fact they are attempting to influence and change the domestic issues of Ukraine. This is nearly always condemned no matter who executes it, and unless the nation gains permission from the UN to intervene (i.e Libya) there are nearly no examples of that nation being left uncritisised.

d3a683d0fe44a94f4e1fd6e6b3e74843,t3uanp,hyuueee,"Summary of the war so far:

Russia started out by trying to appear like they were entering Ukraine in a ""peacekeeping"" operation. They announced that Donetsk and Luhansk were to be considered independent of Ukraine, and then started advancing troops from the south, east, and north. The southern advancement, out of Crimea, is not doing a whole lot strategically (I think?). In the southeast, Russian forces are advancing slowly and establishing control of a small but expanding region. From the northeast, Russian forces have headed straight to Kharkiv, and are attacking the city with artillery. And most notably, from the north, Russia has been focusing a lot of effort on attacking Kyiv, with the specific intention of deposing or assassinating the president Zelenskyy.

In terms of tactics, Ukraine has not yet engaged the Russian invaders head-to-head. Their strategy so far has been to let Russia advance into Ukraine and then ambush supply lines with guerrilla infantry units. Russia has also tried to deploy some special forces and mercenaries to infiltrate Kyiv and kill Zelenskyy, which hasn't worked so far. Ukraine has also defended several paratrooper drops. However, Russia has set up siege positions outside of Kharkiv and Mariupol, and has started shelling residential areas and civilians in an attempt to ""reduce morale"" among the Ukrainians. I've also heard reports of Russia using at least one thermobaric rocket, and a long-range missile from a bomber flying over Belarus.

Ukraine has done an extremely good job of defending against Russia's initial jabs and advances. It seems clear that they're being fed a lot of good intel, have high morale, high alertness and willingness to fight from civilians, and countries around the world have promised them lots of additional ammunition (especially portable anti-tank weapons) and other aide.

Russia, on the other hand, has not taken any cities yet, and is very frustrated by their lack of progress so far. The general consensus seems to be that they were expecting to be able to roll into Kyiv and take it quickly with a show of force, without the rest of world protesting too much, much like they did to Crimea in 2014. They were not expecting the fierce Ukrainian resistance, or the ready avilability of advanced portable weapon systems that can easily destroy their tanks and other armored vehicles. Because of their frustration, it seems like Russia's next move is to send a considerable mass of ground troops and tanks straight torwards Kyiv - that is the ""convoy"" that everyone's talking about. It's likely that this marks a shift in Russia's strategy, and that they will now try to take Kyiv much more forcefully and destructively than they were planning to at first. Ukraine is attacking this convoy as it approaches Kyiv, including drone strikes from Turkish-made combat drones, but it's probably too early to tell how well they're doing right now.",1646098988.0,1646098700.0,t3_t3uanp,t1_hyup58z,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

If the war continues, Russia will most probably win, but it's getting incredibly more costly for them by the day

In my (probably dumb) view, I think Putin wants to find a way he could stop this war now, but he needs to be on ""top"", at least in a narrative. Something that justifies he going after Kviv, and not only the contested regions.

He cannot possibly stop without this, he sacrificed to much.

*Ukrainian parliament member Kira Rudik told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that Monday's negotiations with Russia at the Belarus-Ukraine border resulted in ""heavier air strikes"" in Kyiv.*

*Rudik, who is located in Kyiv, said that the strikes were ""anticipated"" because Russian President Vladimir Putin's words cannot be trusted.*

*""Tonight, there was 'peaceful negotiations,' that obviously resulted in heavier air strikes after — right after the negotiation ended up. And right now, the air strikes intensified and there are more of alarms for the whole night. We anticipated this because — let me give you some tips and tricks on talking to Putin. When he says, 'I want peace,' this means, 'I'm getting my troops to kill you.' If he says, 'It's not my troops,' it means, 'It's my troops and I am gathering them.' And if he says... 'I'm retreating,' this means 'I'm regrouping and getting more troops to kill you,'"" she said.*

*""So it's not news for us when he went on a 'peaceful negotiation' ... that it will end up bringing more troops, destroying more buildings and trying to kill more Ukrainians,"" Rudik explained.*

*She added, ""So, I spent my day today really gathering everything that I can so the resistance team that I formed can survive the siege if there will be one. And we anticipate that there will be a siege in Kyiv.""*

*Rudik also said that Putin will be ""raising the stakes"" in the coming days.*

*""Our first fear is on the air force attacks that will be intensifying. And we have seen that today, already. So tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, there will be more of them to create terror and to create fear. Which we expect. That's why we are not afraid. Second, is he bringing more forces and he will actually try to close in and out to Kyiv. This is something that we are fighting from our side to make sure that he cannot close the entrances and exits to the city. This is where the resistance comes in. And of course, we will be trying to get into the negotiations,"" Rudik said.*",False,1646097785.0,t3_t3uanp,t1_hyus84e,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

This aims to provide a short overview over these terms and maybe help understanding the differences - let me know if there is any other things i should add.

> They could match the move and put American forces on Defcon 3... [but] for now, at least, Mr. Biden chose to de-escalate. The American ambassador to the United Nations reminded the Security Council on Sunday afternoon that Russia was “under no threat” and chided Mr. Putin for “another escalatory and unnecessary step that threatens us all.” The White House made it clear that America’s own alert status had not changed.

> ...

> “It’s what [Putin] does,” Hans M. Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, a global policy think tank in Washington, said in an interview. “It’s verbal saber-rattling. We’ll see where he goes with it. This war is four days old and he’s already made nuclear threats twice.”

> Mr. Kristensen noted that in 2014, when Mr. Putin annexed Crimea, the peninsular part of southern Ukraine that juts into the Black Sea, the Russian president also raised the possibility that his forces might turn to atomic weapons. He recalled that when Mr. Putin was asked how he would react to retaliatory sanctions by the West, he “said he was willing to put his nuclear forces on alert.”

> ...

> Mr. Kristensen of the Federation of American Scientists said the threats could be empty unless matched with evidence that nuclear weapons are being removed from storage and prepared for action.

> “Unless we see that kind of thing,” Mr. Kristensen said, “it’s rhetoric — it’s madman brinkmanship.”

Condensed milk is used in recipes for the Brazilian candy brigadeiro (where condensed milk is the main ingredient), key lime pie, caramel candies, and other desserts. Condensed milk and sweetened condensed milk is also sometimes used in combination with clotted cream to make fudge in certain countries such as the United Kingdom.

In parts of Asia and Europe, sweetened condensed milk is the preferred milk to be added to coffee or tea. Many countries in Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam and Cambodia, use condensed milk to flavor their hot or iced coffee. In Malaysia and Singapore, teh tarik is made from tea mixed with condensed milk, and condensed milk is an integral element in Hong Kong tea culture. In the Canary Islands, it is served as the bottom stripe in a glass of the local café cortado and, in Valencia, it is served as a café bombón.

Borden's Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk has noted that ice cream could be made quite simply at home with their product, cream, and various simple flavorings, being ready to serve after as little as four hours.[19]

In New Orleans, sweetened condensed milk is commonly used as a topping on chocolate or similarly cream-flavored snowballs. In Scotland, it is mixed with sugar and butter then boiled to form a popular sweet candy called tablet or Swiss milk tablet, this recipe being very similar to another version of the Brazilian candy brigadeiro called branquinho. In some parts of the Southern United States, condensed milk is a key ingredient in lemon ice box pie, a sort of cream pie. In the Philippines, condensed milk is mixed with some evaporated milk and eggs, spooned into shallow metal containers over liquid caramelized sugar, and then steamed to make a stiffer and more filling version of crème caramel known as leche flan, also common in Brazil under the name pudim de leite.

In Mexico, sweetened condensed milk is one of the main ingredients of the cold cake dessert (the leading brand is ""La Lechera"", the local version of Swiss Milchmädchen or La Laitière by Nestlé), combined with evaporated milk, Marie biscuits, lemon juice, and tropical fruit. In Brazil, this recipe is also done exchanging fruit for puddings, most commonly vanilla and chocolate, known as pavê or torta de bolacha. It is also used to make homemade dulce de leche by baking it in an oven. In Brazil, this is done by baking the unopened can in a bain-marie, the result being doce de leite. In Britain and Ireland, the contents of a boiled can are used as the layer between the biscuit base and the banana and cream level in banoffee. There is also a pastry-based tart that is popular in the county of Kent, England called Gypsy tart. The pastry case is then filled with a mixture of brown sugar and either condensed milk, evaporated milk, or a mixture of the two before being baked. In Latin American and Central American countries, condensed milk (along with evaporated milk and whole milk or canned cream) is used as a key ingredient in the tres leches cake dessert.

In Soviet culture it was once common to boil a can of condensed milk in water for about three hours. The resulting product is a sweet semi-liquid substance which can be used as a cake icing or put between layers. It is essentially the same as dulce de leche. A similar product is called kajmak in Central Asia (although the original kaymak is a product similar to clotted cream).[20][21] In Russia its called varionaya sguschyonka (translates as ""boiled condensed milk""). The Soviet tradition and kaymak are also known in Poland.",False,1646096970.0,t3_t3uanp,t1_hyup6gi,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Is irregardless a word?

Yes. It may not be a word that you like, or a word that you would use in a term paper, but irregardless certainly is a word. It has been in use for well over 200 years, employed by a large number of people across a wide geographic range and with a consistent meaning. That is why we, and well-nigh every other dictionary of modern English, define this word. Remember that a definition is not an endorsement of a word’s use.

Also sevastopol port which is a russian base in crimea is quite key which Russia rented from ukraine.

fdfebb0d5db6aba0d2ef7bb8044e007c,t3uanp,hyuo85e,"Lots of factors at play. Consider the following:

* What happens when someone taps their brakes in heavy traffic? Car behind reacts and brakes, car behind, etc., rippling all the way to the end. Same goes for if there's a temporary halt--each vehicle in line will have a rippled effect of starting to move forward. This rubber band effect can be achieved with just the simple act of the lead convoy vehicle braking to navigate a very small road hazard, and the effects will ripple down the line. Convoys are not ""constant speed"" so much as ""constant stop and start in the most frustrating traffic jam of your life.""

* It's not a videogame, you don't cross a finish line and your vehicle magically gets added to a siege counter against your objective. Upon reaching the battle line, vehicles need to be directed into appropriate staging areas. Depending how the convoy is organized that could be easy, or it could be hard. Regardless, it's an additional layer of slowdown.

* What happens when a vehicle in the convoy runs out of fuel after sitting in it for 40 hours? Periodic convoy halts may be called in order to ensure that vehicles are appropriately fueled. Imagine sitting in traffic for 40-50 hours, to then arrive at your destination, and then not have any fuel left to drive around and do things. Imagine what the time requirements are to refuel thousands of vehicles at a time.

Convoys are slow. Assuming they move an average of 1 mph is oversimplifying WHY they're slow. Slow in this context often means they simply don't move at all for a few hours. And ""average"" speed in this context is not useful, because that implies constant movement, which they're not.

**EDIT: I failed to mention above, but these factors represent OPTIMAL conditions. Now imagine how hostile countryside, with potential ambushes or strikes lurking in every piece of roadside trash/every bit of obstructive terrain/every bump or pothole in the road can impact the travel capabilities.",1646096489.0,1646095772.0,t3_t3uanp,t1_hyumq6m,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

> \#Putin’s legitimacy built on image as the strong leader who restored #Russia to superpower after the disasters of the 90’s

> Now the economy is in shambles & the military is being humiliated & his only tools to reestablish power balance with the West is cyber & nukes

Additionally, he wants to make sure Ukraine cannot join NATO/EU.

Next, Ukraine is also rich in minerals and arable land. Natural gas and petroleum and part of the gas pipeline. From google:
>Ukraine has extremely rich and complementary mineral resources in high concentrations and close proximity to each other. The country has abundant reserves of coal, iron ore, natural gas, manganese, salt, oil, graphite, sulfur, kaolin, titanium, nickel, magnesium, timber, and mercury. It's the leading nation when it comes to reserves of titanium, iron and non-metallic raw materials. Ukraine has a major ferrous metals industry and ranks among the top steel producers in the world. This fertile land is behind Ukraine's grain strength, helping it to become one of the world's largest exporters of wheat and maize, as well as the world's largest exporter of sunflower oil, which is the fourth most-consumed vegetable oil in the world.

Finally, Ukraine has a strategic and direct connection on the black sea.

So two times that we know of Russian being in a position to launch a nuke, cooler heads prevailed.  Some people will tell me every person in the nuclear chain of command is a rabid Putin supporter. I'll say that's unlikely. Then we will both flame each other saying neither of us has proof.

I just saw on the news that several high-ranking oligarchs have just publicly broke with Putin and demanded an end to this invasion. This is unprecedented and hopefully more will follow suit.

If that happens, Putin may be finished for good this time. He can't launch nukes without 2 other people - and no reasonable person in Russia believes the west is responsible for this.
