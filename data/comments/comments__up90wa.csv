Day 80 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It has now been 5 days without shelling, and it’s pretty amazing. Today we had lightning and thunder for the first time since the beginning of the war. It doesn’t feel the same as it did before, now it sounds exactly like shelling, which sucks, because we love thunder, but now when you hear it your body involuntarily reacts to it the same way it does to shelling, by tensing up and feeling fear.

Well, good news is that today we had more confirmations of our forces reaching the border with Russia. Some journalist said that yet another settlement has been liberated, but without saying which one it was (most likely it is Ternova), and said that we are now only a couple hundred meters away from the border.

Actually another sign of us reaching the border came from Russia itself. They posted a story about a “heroic soldier” that “singlehandedly stopped Ukrainians from attacking Belgorod” by “fighting them off while being wounded and sitting in a tank that was on fire after being hit 4 times (not specified what it was hit with)”. 

But we thought Russia is winning? Then why is a single wounded soldier in a burning tank the last thing that is stopping Ukraine from advancing on Belgorod? It’s especially funny to read this stuff when even their own people like Strelkov are saying that their army is a disaster and the battle for Kharkiv is lost.",False,1652575482.0,t3_up90wa,t3_up90wa,,0,184,0,184,0,0,

d5e30660babceb1a7598c1f18e2dde7f,up90wa,i8jzjgi,"Satellite imagery and first-hand testimony have provided a fuller picture of the multiple and disastrous efforts by Russian forces to cross the Siverskyi Donets River in eastern Ukraine over the past week.

New video and analysis of drone and satellite imagery show that the Russians may have lost as many as 70 armored vehicles and other equipment in attempting to cross the river early this week. Their goal was to try to encircle Ukrainian defenses in the Luhansk region, but it failed spectacularly. 

In its account of the battle, Ukraine's 80th separate assault brigade said it had ""destroyed the pontoons and thwarted nine crossing attempts.""

It claimed that ""at least 73 units of equipment were destroyed, including T-72 tanks"" and a variety of infantry fighting vehicles.

This tally appears supported by analysis of drone video showing Russian equipment strewn along a track to the north of the river, as well as half-submerged tanks.

It's clear that the Ukrainians had previously worked out where the Russians were likely to try to lay down the pontoons and had observed the approach of Russian units. Reconnaissance of possible crossing points had begun at least two days before the Russian attempt.

The Siverskyi Donets flows quickly and the Russians appear to have needed motorized tugs to try to complete the bridge. The noise was a further clue to Ukrainian units that an attempt to ford the river was underway.

In its account, the 80th brigade says that ""despite heavy losses, the enemy still managed to break through ... gaining a foothold on the northern outskirts of one of the settlements."" At least 30 Russian vehicles and infantry did make the crossing. 

Other Ukrainian officials say that those Russian units that did get across, north of the village of Bilohorivka, were stranded.

""Fierce, heavy fighting lasted about two days,"" the 80th brigade said on its Facebook page. ""The paratroopers destroyed a whole battalion-tactical group (BTG) of invaders!""
Open source analysis suggests this is probably true, with at least 30 infantry fighting vehicles counted among the wreckage at the site of the pontoon, not counting what may have been destroyed among the equipment that did get across.

In its analysis of the episode, the Institute for the Study of War said that ""Ukrainian forces likely inflicted heavy casualties on Russian forces attempting to cross the Siverskyi Donets River.""

""Russian forces have likely lost the momentum necessary to execute a large-scale crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River,"" it added.

Mick Ryan, a former Major General in the Australian armed forces who studies the Ukrainian conflict, tweeted: ""Russians clearly intended to invest in this axis and throw a lot of combat power down it.

""Consequently, this is probably a larger setback for the Russians than some have speculated,"" Ryan said in a post published to his verified Twitter account.

It has likely resulted in not just a BTG but probably an entire Brigade losing a large part of its combat power.""
""Importantly, the Russians lost scarce engineer bridging equipment (and probably combat engineers too). These resources are neither cheap nor available in large quantities. And these are in high demand during an offensive.""

The Russians' inability to advance from the north across the river has likely slowed down its offensive in Luhansk, which for now is reliant on troops moving from the east and south through frontlines that have moved little in a month.

Ukraine has ""likely won the battle of Kharkiv"", a well-known military think-tank, the Institute for the Study of War, says. Russian forces which had been trying to encircle the north-eastern city seem to have given up and left the area, it says

Russian forces have been pushed back from Kharkiv towards the border - and the Ukrainian military leadership now says the ""enemy's main efforts are focused on ensuring the withdrawal of its units"" above anything else

The governor of the Kharkiv region says that residents have started returning to the city to deal with the destruction left in the wake of the battle - but warns it may not yet be safe

Separately, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence predicts the war will be over by year's end; in an interview with Sky News, Major General Kyrylo Budanov said the turning point would be mid-August

And Sweden and Finland are both invited to attend a meeting of Nato foreign ministers on Saturday as guests - while the Kremlin repeats its warnings of unspecific consequences if they go ahead with joining the Western military alliance

""Russia's actions are causing supplies to fail, prices to rise immeasurably — not only in our country but around the world — and the threat of brutal hunger,“ Baerbock said. 

""We must not be naïve — this is not collateral damage. It is a deliberately chosen instrument in a hybrid war that is being waged right now,“ she added. 

""Russia is preparing the breeding ground for new crises in order to deliberately weaken international cohesion against Russia's war,“ said Baerbock. ""Hunger, instability, energy insecurity, the creeping erosion of democratic values, but also of human rights through disinformation"" are caused by the Russian aggression on Ukraine, Baerbock said. 

Some background: Russia and Ukraine both produce almost 30% of global wheat exports. Russian troops have been stealing farm equipment and thousands of tons of grain from Ukrainian farmers, as well as targeting food storage sites with artillery, according to sources. Ukraine's defense ministry said last week that an estimated 400,000 tons of grain had been stolen by Russian troops. And CNN tracked a Russian ship loaded with nearly 30,000 tons of Ukrainian grain that was turned away from two Mediterranean ports before landing in Syria.

""How we act, or how we don't act, will shape the way we live together in the world for many years or perhaps decades to come. That is why ducking out of the way, passivity or dithering, hesitation, and then in the end saying nothing at all, is not an option for us, for me personally,"" Baerbock said. 

""Having had to make many decisions in recent weeks to support Ukraine in a sprint,"" Baerbock now fears that the alliance must prepare for ""a long-distance race"" to ""to fight this global crisis.""

""We will never recognize border changes that Russia wants to enforce by military force,“ Baerbock added.

""Ukraine's head of military intelligence says the war with Russia is going so well, that it will reach a turning point by mid-August and be over by the end of the year.

It is the most precise and optimistic prediction by a senior Ukrainian official so far.

In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Major General Kyrylo Budanov also said a coup to remove Vladimir Putin is already under way in Russia and the Russian leader is seriously ill with cancer.

Russian agents 'believe Putin is terminally ill' - Ukraine news live

The general's office is dark and stuffed with the paraphernalia of war and espionage, sandbags stacked on its windows, machine guns piled on the floor, and a spare rifle magazine on his desk used as a paperweight.

He is remarkably young to lead his country's military intelligence agency at just 36 years and speaks with the dry precision of his trade.

He showed little emotion, smiling only once as he said in English: ""I'm optimistic.""

General Budanov correctly predicted when the Russian invasion would happen when others in his government were publicly sceptical and now says he is confident about predicting its conclusion.

""The breaking point will be in the second part of August.

""Most of the active combat actions will have finished by the end of this year.

""As a result, we will renew Ukrainian power in all our territories that we have lost including Donbas and the Crimea.""

Russia's tactics have not changed despite its shift to the east he says, and Russia is suffering huge losses though he would not be drawn on Ukrainian casualties.

Russia just a 'horde of people with weapons'

He said he was not surprised by Russia's setbacks in the war.

""We know everything about our enemy. We know about their plans almost as they're being made.

""Europe sees Russia as a big threat. They are afraid of its aggression.

""We have been fighting Russia for eight years and we can say that this highly publicised Russian power is a myth.

""It is not as powerful as this. It is a horde of people with weapons.""

Russian forces have been pushed back almost to the border around Kharkiv, he says, and a recent attack on forces further south trying to cross the Siverskyy Donets caused considerable damage.

Its aftermath has been caught in dramatic aerial pictures.

""I can confirm that they suffered heavy losses in manpower and armour and I can say that when the artillery strikes happened many of the crews abandoned their equipment,"" General Budanov said.

'Impossible to stop coup'

General Budanov also told Sky News defeat in Ukraine would lead to the removal of Russia's leader and the country's disintegration.

""It will eventually lead to the change of leadership of the Russian Federation. This process has already been launched and they are moving into that way.""

Does that mean a coup is under way?

""Yes,"" he responded.

""They are moving in this way and it is impossible to stop it.""

He claimed Mr Putin is in a ""very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick"".

The Russian leader has cancer and other illnesses, he says.

He dismissed suggestions he was spreading propaganda as part of the information war and was certain of his claims.

""It's my job, it's my work, if not me who will know this?""

Ukrainian officials have cast doubts about Mr Putin's mental and physical well-being before and declared their certainty about eventually winning, but until this interview, none have been so specific and laid out a timeline for victory, a sign of their increasing confidence on the battlefield.""

Sophie Williams

Reporting from Lviv

The mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov, has told the BBC that the Russians have withdrawn from the Kharkiv city area in the direction of the Russian border.

He says that Russian troops had only ever managed to enter a small part of the key north-eastern city once, and were not there for a long time.

""The Russians were constantly shelling Kharkiv because they were staying very close to the city. And due to the efforts of Kharkiv territorial defence and Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Russians have withdrawn out far from the city area in the direction of the Russian border,” he says.

""Now it is calm in Kharkiv and people are gradually coming back to the city. We provide water, gas and electricity supply to all the citizens. However, unfortunately, many residential buildings are destroyed or damaged. So, in the future we will have to do huge reconstruction.

""There was no shelling in the city for the last five days. There was only one attempt from Russians to hit the city with a missile rocket near Kharkiv airport, but the missile was eliminated by Ukrainian Air Defence.""",False,1652527065.0,t3_up90wa,t3_up90wa,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

India has suddenly banned all export of wheat over shortage fears - despite earlier promises to boost them and help feed the rest of the world.

Ukraine is a major exporter of grains like wheat, but its ability to get harvests out of the country has been hit by Russia's invasion. India - one of the world's other big suppliers - had stepped in, saying it was targeting record-setting wheat exports this year.

But now it has suddenly reversed course, saying it needs to guarantee its own food security first.

Experts say inflation causing domestic prices to shoot up, along with a sudden heatwave that's prompted fears of a small harvest, are behind the move.

That could pose a major problem for the rest of the world. Between them, India and Ukraine are behind about a third of global annual wheat sales.",False,1652527842.0,t3_up90wa,t3_up90wa,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

A Ukrainian lawmaker called on the United States to provide air defense systems and fighter jets to Ukraine, saying that the situation on the battlefield is ""far worse"" than it was at the beginning of the war. 

> “It is hell” on the frontlines right now, Oleksandra Ustinova told reporters at a German Marshall Fund roundtable in Washington Friday. “We keep losing many more men now than it was at the beginning of the war.” 

Daria Kaleniuk, a leading Ukrainian civil society activist, explained “we can't win this war with Soviet equipment because A. Russia has much more Soviet equipment, B. we don't have anywhere to get ammunition for this, and C. Russia simply has more people and more troops.""

Ustinova said Ukraine no longer seeks the Soviet-era MiG fighter jets because “the war has changed.”

Instead, she said Ukraine needs the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Paladin self-propelled howitzers, and fighter jets like the F-16s in order to effectively counter Russia, and called on the US to begin training Ukrainian pilots to use such jets. 

Kaleniuk, who said she recently met with Ukrainian defense officials in Kyiv, noted that Ukraine has “combat-experienced pilots, who are willing and ready to go now for trainings. They were willing to go yesterday for trainings. But there is no decision to accept them and to provide that because there is no decision to provide fighter jets.”

The US has begun to send heavy weaponry to Ukraine, but has yet to give them MLRS or fighter jets. 

Ustinova and Kaleniuk, who were in Washington this week for meetings, said that they believe there is a lack of “political will that is needed” for the administration to decide to send such kinds of heavy weaponry – and quickly — and the feeling that there is still fear about provoking Moscow. 

They decried the fact that it took so long for the US to decide to send the heavy weaponry it is sending now, with Ustinova saying, “if we had Howitzers two months ago, Mariupol would not happen because they wouldn't be able to surround like they did, to surround the city and literally destroy it.”

“For us time means lives, thousands of lives. We've been hearing that it has been unprecedented how fast everything is moving and how fast the decisions are taking. But there has never been a war since World War Two like that. And unfortunately, we keep asking here to take the decisions faster,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin likely intends to annex occupied southern and eastern Ukraine directly into the Russian Federation in the coming months. He will likely then state, directly or obliquely, that Russian doctrine permitting the use of nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory applies to those newly annexed territories. Such actions would threaten Ukraine and its partners with nuclear attack if Ukrainian counteroffensives to liberate Russian-occupied territory continue. Putin may believe that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would restore Russian deterrence after his disastrous invasion shattered Russia's conventional deterrent capabilities.

Putin’s timeline for annexation is likely contingent on the extent to which he understands the degraded state of the Russian military in Ukraine. The Russian military has not yet achieved Putin’s stated territorial objectives of securing all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and is unlikely to do so. If Putin understands his military weakness, he will likely rush annexation and introduce the nuclear deterrent quickly in an attempt to retain control of the Ukrainian territory that Russia currently occupies. If Putin believes that Russian forces are capable of additional advances, he will likely delay the annexation in hopes of covering more territory with it. In that case, his poor leadership and Ukrainian counteroffensives could drive the Russian military toward a state of collapse. Putin could also attempt to maintain Russian attacks while mobilizing additional forces. He might delay announcing annexation for far longer in this case, waiting until reinforcements could arrive to gain more territory to annex.

Ukraine and its Western partners likely have a narrow window of opportunity to support a Ukrainian counteroffensive into occupied Ukrainian territory before the Kremlin annexes that territory. Ukraine and the West must also develop a coherent plan for responding to any annexation and to the threat of nuclear attack that might follow it. The political and ethical consequences of a longstanding Russian occupation of southeastern Ukraine would be devastating to the long-term viability of the Ukrainian state.

Russian forces continue shaping operations for the Battle of Severodonetsk from the south even though those losses have at least temporarily disrupted their efforts from the north.

Text follows:

Russia’s Donbas offensive has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule. Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition.

Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February.

**These delays will almost certainly be exacerbated by the loss of critical enablers such as bridging equipment and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones.**

**Russian bridging equipment has been in short supply throughout the conflict, slowing and restricting offensive manoeuvre.** Russian UAVs are vital for tactical awareness and directing artillery, but have been vulnerable to Ukrainian anti-air capabilities.

**Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness**. Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine.

Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.

Never forget that the GOP....
- Held up $40bn in aid (Rand)
- Removed supporting Ukraine from the GOP platform in 2020
- Supported Trump's attempts to blackmail Zelenskyy into creating dirt on Joe Biden
- Argued that Ukraine was historically a part of Russia giving Russia the right to invade 
- Praised Putin for his 'smart' move invading Ukraine
- Spent the 4th of July weekend in Moscow with Putin
- Secretly delivered letters between Trump and Putin 
- Are known to have several congressmen on Russia's payroll
- Believed Russian statements over US intelligence on Russian meddling in Western elections
- Directly benefitted from Russian Support in the 2016 election while blocking increased funding to stop Russian efforts 

Do not give the GOP credit for anything,  they only started supporting Ukraine when it was the popular thing to do...

What has happened to Richard Engle? A month ago, he was reporting from the front lines in Ukraine, then he went silent. Was he wounded? Injured? Is he dead?

Why was there no announcement? Is his fate unknown?

I believe Engle first gained notoriety in the first Gulf War. In that he reported from Baghdad, the only American reporter in Iraq for a considerable time. Since then he has reported from almost every war and conflict zone, often being the only American reporter on the scene.

> Title: Russian lawmaker warns Poland is next in line for 'denazification after Ukraine'

**Subtext:** Russian lawmakers are in effect vessels for the true beliefs of Putin and his advisers. This means that a Russian invasion of Poland is inevitable and will 100% be happening soon after this war. Once Russia invades Poland, Poland will trigger article 5, which will cause all of NATO to get involved. This will quickly escalate to nuclear armageddon. All of human civilisation will die out, with the few survivors left to forage for food and water.

> Title: Russia plans to send message by flying nuclear ""doomsday"" plane at parade

**Subtext:** Russia rarely, if ever, flies their nuclear ""doomsday"" plane at parades. This means that Putin and his advisers think they will need it in the near future. The meaning of this is that Russia is planning to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine and/or Western countries, which will invoke a nuclear response from the US. This will quickly escalate to nuclear armageddon, but Russians such as Putin won't care because they'll be alive in a doomsday plane. All of human civilisation will die out, with the few survivors left to forage for food and water.

> Title: Russian foreign minister accuses West of considering ""nuclear war""

**Subtext:** The Russian foreign minister directly conveys Putin's thoughts. This means that his thoughts are currently directed at accusing the West of provoking him so that he can use a nuclear first strike on Ukraine or (more probably) countries where good civilised white people live like the UK or the USA. Once this happens, it will cause untold death and destruction of you and your family, as well as everyone you love. If you do somehow survive then your old life will certainly be gone.

Lyrics:

The balalaika rings silent from Minsk to Red Square

The cortege assembles to bury the bear

Nadia Rostropovich looks on in despair

With Irina, Catharina and Olga


And quietly remembering her brother Ivan

Shot in the back in Afghanistan

The Stalinist purges, the snowy white grave

That claimed Boris, Dimitri and Igor


She remembered how proud she cheered with the crowd

When Yuri Gagarin sailed over the clouds

Nadia and Ivan shouted aloud

We put the first man in space


But that was before the feared KGB

Put a question mark over her own loyalty

To keep an eye on her comrades one two and three

Irina, Catharina and Olga


And poor uncle Vlad' whom the Doc declared mad

For refusing to leave his beloved Leningrad

She stood in the doorway tearful and sad

When they frog-marched him of to the Gulag


He took a last look at his own native hills

Where grew the red dogwoods and wild daffodils

The look on his face was haunting her still

Comrade Nadia Rostropovich


Sometimes alone she'd think of the West

Ladies with opals adorning their breast

Park Avenue poseurs who behave like the Tsar

With silver coke spoons for their caviar


She'd reflect back to when she'd just turned ten

And faithfully subscribed to fair play for all men

But seventy odd years of Bolshevik dreams

Had worn down her pride and left her no means

To cope with her own disillusions


If Trotsky and Engels saw the Dachas and Zils

The Politburo boys with their hands in the till

The bear was long dead before he got ill

Was it the cure or was it the fever?



No more reds under beds to freak out the Feds

A defunct Superpower in tatters and shreds

The marks left by Karl leave them queuing for bread

Depp trial. To be fair, many people who beg for more news just want to gawk at an active major war. Obviously normal people don't want to see more killings of civilians in the streets, but there's more to this war than the actual combat, like hospitals being set up, or food kitchens making meals for troops, or European charities setting up systems to help refugees, but that's boring to the casual observer who are glued to the commercialized media cycle.

I vastly overestimated russia and underestimated Ukraine.  While I didn't buy the propaganda lines given Russian troubles in Syria, I still thought they would be somewhat competent.  However, we've seen corruption, poor leadership, poor doctrine, a lack of training, bad logistics and the poor composition of their BTGs. I'm an interested layman, so not a total idiot but not an expert. I even thought Ukraine would end up losing Kyiv eventually.

Speaking of Ukraine, it seems like they took the shock of the invasion of Crimea and did everything right militarily since.  They've organized and took NATO training to heart.  They didn't burn manpower and equipmemt in pointless stands against advancing russians, but instead struck russian logistics relentlessly.  And with the easing of pressure following the Russian retreat from Kyiv, they got established and have been doing extremely well in their counter offenses, too.

Obviously supporting Ukraine is important for supporting the rights of democracy across the entire world and fighting back against a tyrannical nation who wants to impede on your sovereignty, but what does this mean for the average person?

We can look at things like forcing Russia off of Ukraine's land completely could make it easier to gain access to the oil and gas reserves, which thereby reduces the rate of inflation on products requiring those (let's be honest, prices never go down, but the rate of increase does). Ukraine is a heavily agricultural country, so ending the war will help reduce inflation on food products that involve grain, sunflower/vegetable oil, etc.

It's all good and well telling people ""GOP doesn't care about Ukraine"", but it does need to be supplemented with why supporting Ukraine is important to the average person.

Edit: I feel like I need to be clear. Yes, I support Ukraine. That includes their territorial integrity completely. However, when arguments are being made for the political space, yes, it is important to be reductive. Not everyone will care about doing the right thing, there will be people who vote because they care about their bottom line.

I have two big gripes with the Austrian government: (1) their extraordinarily clumsy PR, getting everybody to hate us for things we end up not doing at all.

And the latest thing about trading territory... The last times France traded territories at the end of a war was because it was heavily defeated by Germany. This was not willingly traded. And that's not even counting that this was more or less tried already with Ukraine and Russia in 2014 with Crimea, and look what the result is. Putin does not want territories, he wants Ukraine, all of it.

And I am also frustrated by not seeing in France, or for that matter across Europe, advertising campaigns to ask people to reduce fossil fuel consumption. It is almost free, there are no constraints on people yet, and can help reduce the consumption a little bit so that we can replenish the storage faster. It is not even a matter of cutting Russian oil and gas earlier, it is a matter of protecting ourselves from Russia who will use it fully next winter if this drags on. We must prepare for that.

a0292d8613e5d41cb04f8d738028135d,up90wa,i8mw486,"I think you are missing 4 key points:

1. Historically the Russian elite always liked to see themselves as European as any white supremacist would. There's nothing more European than thinking of Europe as some sort of civilized and holier place than others. They don't like to be seen as Asians. They historically travelled to Switzerland a lot to be there with the other elites, talk in french, that kind of thing.

2. The Russian political elite is very clear that their problem is the US/UK influence and that they want their borders and interests respected. They even allowed Ukraine to be in the EU as long as they kept their military low and still had deals with Russia. This whole conflict has a lot to do with the US wanting more military ""safety"" for their control over Europe and the UK being annoyed with nordstream 2 and the new arctic sea route.

Collaborating with ""Europe"" isn't about what Greeks, Spanish, or Portuguese people want, it's mostly about what the powerful nations want, and they want to keep the current world order where they are doing almost whatever they want.

3. There's also a further complexity in the question which is that eastern Europe has plenty of radical movements that are anti Russian (Poland is massively anti Russia historically for example, for them Russian Empire, USSR, Russia is all the same). It's against their economical, political and historical interests to let Russia be in a ""free market"" with them. The troika is already a problem, imagine if you also had Russian companies and lobbies involved. A neutral position between powers is great for countries that are able to manage it, like Switzerland historically did, but it's not a simple thing to do and has its risks.

4. The US/UK are the ones that do anything they want. UK quit Europe because they think they are better off by themselves than mixing with other Europeans (doesn't matter if part of the population disagrees, that's what their elite thinks). They will not accept other super powers to exist. The US isn't doing charity helping Ukraine, they are protecting their interest of being the main super power. Russia doesn't accept US leadership, and US doesn't accept not being the leader of all, so there's no end to this. There are scholars that defend that the US should have collaborated with Russia to avoid wars and improve the world, but that's clearly not what boomer politicians think.",False,1652571867.0,t3_up90wa,t1_i8mm2bv,,1,-9,0,-9,0,0,

Ukraine pushes Russia back around Kharkiv and to the suburbs of Kherson. Russia's offensive closes the current Ukrainian pocket in Donbass with massive losses. Front lines freeze up with heavy fortifications and both sides shell each other with no real attacks.
Negotiations about a ceasefire result in a reduced amount of shelling, but it never gets to zero. 

Russia claims the occupied areas of Ukraine as its own, which results in a renewed offensive from Ukraine, but again, with minimal movement of the front. People in Ukraine and the west start blaming each other for why Russia is still inside Ukraine.

Sanctions against Russia cripples the Russian economy but they focus the money they have on the military to ensure there is no military coup and that they don't lose ground in Ukraine. The exodus from Russia continues, and Putin blocks exit visas to prevent young people from leaving the country.

At some point, once Russia ceases the majority of their offensive operations Ukraine will switch gears to start taking territory back, territory that was taken early and with little resistance, IE, Donbas, Luhansk, Kherson, nvm Crimea but that’s even further out.

Artillery is nice and all right now, but I highly doubt Ukraine is going to relentlessly shell their own cities/towns/villages and civilians in the aforementioned territories. “Precision guided” doesn’t mean much in urban warfare, that doesn’t magically remove collateral damage, it simply makes them more accurate. For example, the US invading Iraq/Baghdad, they are lot more liberal with their fire power compared to a world where they were having to take back Washington, LA, etc, etc, with US civilians still present.  


I’m not saying Ukraine won’t succeed for those that only like hearing over the top positive news, simply that these operations are going to take time and require a superior/numerical force, and like I said can’t start until Russia ceases offensive operations, hence all the time lines for the current phase of operations.",False,1652575129.0,t3_up90wa,t1_i8n0egx,,1,8,0,8,0,0,

The soviets had more men and equipment in the field, were battle hardened and at that point, their ground equipment was superior to ours and their air forces was likely pretty close to equal.  Even if we added what was left of the German regular military to the effort, we'd still have likely been overrun.    


There's also the factor of logistics.  Everything the western allies were fighting with was coming over from the US by ship.  Even as large as our transport capability was, Stalin's factories were far closer and could send new equipment and supplies far faster by train and road.  Even if we could have pushed the Soviets back for a while, it would have been hell to keep our forces supplied, and the Soviets would be shortening their supply lines.  

Even if we went as far as expecting the nuclear option would become available, we'd have had a lot harder time delivering those bombs to Russian targets than over an already broken Japan.  We also didn't have a lot of them, and they took a long time to make more.  Then there's the question of whether Stalin would surrender even if we managed to start nuking Soviet cities.  I could see him fighting on to the last unless we were lucky enough to catch him under one of our nukes.

Don't get me wrong, I'd have loved to see the Soviet Union taken down in 1945 ( or some year soon after ), but I don't think we were in a position to actually pull it off, and would have paid an even heavier price for our failure.

This is the dynamic of the oil game. You don’t want to pump out as much as possible during high oil prices bc that just pushes prices down. 

You don’t want to start a costly drilling operation in land that already has government approval bc that can take years and by then, the price of oil might have dropped. It’s better to just control supply and demand by increasing/decreasing output with the drilling operations you have now.

You guys have any idea what war does to people’s lives? Or you just avoid looking at the pictures of kids without parents or torn families, killed civilians laying for weeks on the streets and pretend it is not part of the war. 

That thing we see in the western media that civilians are not targeted is not the whole story. Yeah nice theory. If say US gets into a conflict like this with a country that matches it, there *will* be razed cities and infrastructure. Because the enemy soldiers will use civilian buildings for defense that become justified targets. Or just they get locations wrong. 

Not every civilian has the means or destination to just go away from the conflict zones. And those who go, will leave their posessions behind. 

Ok, you are young and maybe have less things (in which case you are ideal for forced draft), but what about families with children? War starts, dad is drafted, mon has to evacuate god knows where with the kids taking whatever fits in the car if they have one. Their lives are fucked forever, if they lose their jobs and the place they lived in and have kids to raise what they will do, they have to rely on other people’s goodwill. And dad maybe does not make it or becomes disabled. And better lets not get into the question of what happens to refugees with no fighting age males if they run into criminal gangs. Or involuntarily end up in the line of fire. 

And this is regardless of the goodwill of the armies. They both may try to act within the laws of war, civilians in inhabited areas will always get in the way, lives are lost and property is destroyed. 

And even on the ground for soldiers trained and experimenced this kind of drone driven conflict with guided munitions is very dangerous. This is not Iraq or Afghanistan where the enemy is armed with aks and rpgs, has no air capabilities and sits at the mercy of overwhelming airforce or artillery.

- Ukraine is a strategic commercial ally as both a critical wheat / grain exporter and energy / gas / oil exporter for NATO countries, allowing for stronger economies / trade.

- Ukraine is a militarily strategic ally as a strong buffer against Russian aggression in the West. Supporting Ukraine now will mean less $$ spent supporting NATO and a wider conflict later on.  

- The US made certain, albeit soft assurances to Ukraine that we would support their independence if they gave up their nukes. Our word having meaning is critically important in international affairs. If we ever want to see a denuclearized world, we must defend Ukraine now.  

- Russia is one of the biggest competitors in arms exports vs the US. Humiliating Russia in this war will drastically change how the world makes arms purchases in favor of NATO / the US

- This is literally a conflict between authoritarian rule and a free democracy. There is a much higher inclination towards peace between democracies than between a democracy and another form of government, particularly an authoritarian one. Peace is good for a democracy because it provides the stability needed for global economic growth, which is especially good for the super power and guarantor of that stability,  the US.

We decided there and then to take a trip to moscow over the holidays to have one last blast before we start our finals.

One thing led to another, and we got in trouble with some angry fellows who were _not_ as much fun as Bert would make it out.

Honestly I am beginning to suspect he exaggerated quite a bit about how friendly the Russian mob is.

Long story short, we had a choice of either parting with our kneecaps or getting drafted into a local Russian garrison that was basically owned by the mob.

We decided that getting drafted was better than having our knees blown away by Pavel and his shotgun. The shotgun was named Kolka, btw.

Next thing we know we bunk up with some hapless and very surly troops, and before we could figure out a plan to sneak out one nigh they load us on choppers and dump us in the middle of what we thought was Siberia at first.

No phones, no money and our Pasports still somewhere in Moscow under the personal care of Pavel and Kolka, we realised that out in the field was the best chance we had.

Nobody we were with knew exactly where we were, but they assured us that this was not Siberia. It was only when Fred, who had traveled quite a bit with his parents as a teen, saw a highway sign that we realised we were in Ukraine.

Oh. I remember the relief! Ukraine is practically Europe, after all. The plan was to detatch from the group one night, hitch a side to the nearest city and make our way to the embassy.

Then the shooting started.

The Ukranians and the Russians were at war, and we were right in the middle of it.

Enough was enough, and when the driver of the truck we were in - his name was Aslan, nice guy all considered - managed to roll the truck into a ditch one morning 1am, we took our chance and bolted.

It was a miracle that nobody suffered anything worse than a sprained wrist and a few bruises.

We decided to keep low and head West. Dumping our uniforms wasn't too hard. We happened on a farmer who we were able to convince that we were not Russian, appearances notwithstanding, and he gave us some old overalls.

Eventually we got to a river, and it seemed that there had been some form of battle there. We managed to get one of those amphibious troop carriers going, the Russians were abandoning a lot of stuff everywhere, and decided to make a crossing at first light.

Aaaand that is where we get to me, standing on the back of a slowly sinking troop carrier, in the middle of a river, shouting instructions at Fred, when the first inkling that we were being watched exploded on the bank we just came from.

So here we are, Fred, Jack, Norman and me, in and on top of a troop carrier that is slowly sinking while refusing to go straight, and someone is dropping Mortars on us.

I have a friend who grew up in the area and he helped provide a bit more context. So I'll preface all of this with his bottom line (he's not Kurdish but from a minority in the region).

***Don't fuck with the Kurds***

The Kurds exist in an area that spans areas in SE Turkey, Eastern Syria, SW Iran and Northern Iraq.

They are a distinct people and culture and quite a numerous one in that area.

They want their own country and have done since forever.

All the issues from that stem from the colonial breakup in the middle east into countries in the 20th century. None of them took into account the Kurds.

Kurdish terrorist groups have existed in Turkey since, some Communist, some not, some actually terrorists, some more activist.

Opposition to Erdogan in Turkey has very strong backing in Kurdish communities and because Erdogan is a semi-authorititarian nationalist, he takes a pretty hard line against them. But this is not new for the Turkish Government, this has been going on for years.

The Kurds independence and representation is a really complicated issue in Turkey, and no ones hands are clean but most Kurds are peaceful and just want to live their lives in peace (like most humans funnily enough), although most probably support an independent Kurdistan.

That's pretty much not going to happen; Turkey, Iran and Syria aren't going to give up territory for a new country.

The closest thing they've got is a semi-autonomous state in areas of Iraq. These guys were the ones who held off ISIL when Iraq could not.

3. Complicated because the people in Crimea are not the people in Crimea.  Certain ethnic groups like the Crimean Tatars have been forcibly relocated.  The majority of the native population are Russian-speaking.  A sizable amount of the property ownership was always non-native:  vacation housing and second homes of wealthy Russians.

 >War Plan Red, also known as the Atlantic Strategic War Plan, was one of the color-coded war plans created by the United States Department of War during the interwar period of 1919–1939, covering scenarios related to a hypothetical war with the British Empire (the ""Red"" forces, likely in reference to the Red Ensign). Many different war plans were prepared by mid-level officers primarily as training exercises in how to calculate the logistical and manpower requirements of fighting a war, and War Plan Red outlined those steps necessary to defend against any attempted invasion of the United States from British forces.

Are you sure about that? Way I hear it, they still have the ability to run air patrols, at least last I heard. Also, I don't know if their drones are run by their Air Force specifically, but they seem to be extremely effective.

> Try gaming US marine corps led by Biden/Harris taking Houston. Preceding it with a bombing campaign is political suicide. The bombing itself would generate the resistance.

Yeah, but Biden's supporters might actually care about people dying in Houston. Putin's supporters regarding people in Kyiv, not so much, it appears. I very much doubt political considerations kept the Russians from bombing air bases and AA sites. It seems more likely to me that they *couldn't* do it - either because they lacked the operational aircraft, or they couldn't devote resources to the fight without leaving themselves vulnerable elsewhere somehow. Either way, it's an enormous failure of leadership.

> If people in Ukraine thought they were alone they may not have taken the same risks with their own life.

Again, I don't know about that. I've heard that the reason Ukrainians fought back so hard is that they *knew* shit like Bucha was coming. No one knows the Russians quite like they do, after all. And if you're likely screwed either way, what do you have to lose by fighting? That's the downside to having a reputation for brutality, I guess.

> Knowing that the gamble turned out badly for Russia does not tell us the odds.

It's true, but at the same time, I think that the Marines' more cautious approach may ultimately prove to have been the better bet. My understanding, for instance, is that the Israelis keeping ahold of air superiority during the 1973 war was a key part of how they managed to resolve that conflict in a stalemate. Being willing to suck up casualties on the ground might be all well and good, but getting air superiority seems to me like the best guarantee that your land forces will be able to make it from point A to point B with its fighting power relatively intact.

Given we know the circumstances surrounding the original plan, they believed they would be welcomed as liberators, it’s makes since that they wouldn’t plan on any massive bombing/bomber campaigns. 

There’s so much information we don’t have right now. Maybe this is a downside to calling this a “special operation”, so you only have access to what you planned for/needed, Or they simply aren’t capable of mustering all the resources together required (or don’t have said resources) for a bombing campaign in such a short time, or maybe it’s a little bit of both.",False,1652578149.0,t3_up90wa,t1_i8n1rcm,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Yes Germany tried to be friendlier with Russia because it was good for them, and they were pressured to change their position by US and friends. You don't have all this conflict without the US pumping weapons in Ukraine like they do in almost every war of the last decades. You are so obsessed with Russia's fault that you deny the responsibility that other countries have.

As I said it doesn't matter what even Germany thinks. Playing neutral game is hard when both sides want conflict with each other.

Ukraine is an example of eastern European that wants nothing to do with Russia, something that Russia doesn't accept. Which is the third point that I made on why Russia being part of a community with Europe is complicated.

The main super powers are super powers, and they have more responsibility than everyone else, they should act for peace, instead they keep playing the sphere of influence game with one another because as USA politicians say ""America first"".

What I'm arguing is that this situation is created by everyone involved. Russia, the UK, France and US want these conflicts to happen because they want geopolitical control and they will fight for it. The conflicts they don't want are the ones that don't matter for them. None of these people are innocent or peacekeepers at all. You can't have Russia and the others being friendly because everyone wants to be the world leader.>You're completely ignoring anything that Russia does or has done. Europe has tried to work with Russia for the past 20 years. Change through trade.

>But Russia doesn't want to play fair. Russia is waging a disinformation war in the west and is financing radical political organizations to see ow division. Russia prefers to dream of the good old days and thinks it is still a super power with an empire. You can't give us the fault for Russia's imperial superiority complex.

The same thing that mainstream media does, the Chinese does, the Brazilian media does. Everyone fights to be top dog and will manipulate the population to have support for wars that don't change anything for them. That's how it is. I'm not excusing Russia for being insecure as every super power is.

>The USA and the EU is definitely using this military failure of Russia, but that's Russia's fault alone. We couldn't use Russia's war against Russia if Russia wouldn't be waging this war right now.
>
>The only country who is waging this war in Ukraine right now is Russia. The only power who could end this war right now is Russia.

You can't control the world, but you are responsible for how you react to it. What the US and others do about the situation is their responsibility. If they try to make peace, put more fire into it, or just make it worse for everyone is on them. They decided to be populist with their sanctions and now everyone is suffering for something that has nothing to do with them.

Putting all the fault in Russia is akin to Russia blaming the Nazis to what they to they did when they pushed them back. Bad actions aren't excuse to do new ones.

Part of this whole thing still is that NATO wants to expand, which only increases the tension, doesn't lower it. I hope that Russia doesn't decide that it's now or never and attack Finland and Sweden too.",False,1652579556.0,t3_up90wa,t1_i8n3a07,,3,-2,0,-2,0,0,

If you tap a message on telegram (maybe with Google translate installed for mobile or an extension for browser) there's a sub menu where you can select translate, similar to Twitter.

>But on Tuesday, Mr. Scholz gave Mr. Biden an opening when he halted the certification of the project.

>“So by acting together with the Germans,” Mr. Price said, “we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel sitting at the bottom of the sea.”

Ivan IV threw off the Mongol yolk, conquered Novgorod, and triggered a 20-40 year anarchy when in a fit of rage he murdered his only son and heir with his cane at dinner.  Commonly known as Ivan 'the Terrible'.

Peter I was originally a boy king who split power with a mentally challenged half brother/cousin (can't remember which).  As he grew up he became obssessed with warfare.  Launched a coup against his co-Tsar and the co-Tsar's mother who was regent.  Started a 20 year war with Sweden for shits and giggles (the war litterally starts with one of the most dramatic smashing of a large Russian force by a small Swedish force in European military history, and for the next 15 years it only gets worse for the Russians from there).  Nearly wrecked Russia and destroyed his empire until the Swedish King went all Napolean and marched a giant army to Poltava with the Russians burning their own farms in front of them.  Then the starving Swedes were crushed.  Founded St. Petersburg.  Chopped beards off of devout Orthodox.  Known as Peter ""The Great.""

Catherine II was a minor german noble that married Peter III.  Catherine led a coup against her husband Peter who must of history considers a fool.  Catherine was an 'Enlightened' despot who formalized serfdom, conquered much of modern Ukraine from the Crimean Khanate and the Turks.  Famously when surveying her land her government was so corrupt that one of her advisors, Potemkin, made fake villages on the shoreline for her to see as she sailed by so she wouldn't know how much money was being stolen.

I work for Svenska kraftnät and the Nordic grid doesn't mean every single MW produced in one region is shared with the rest. Neither does it mean every MW produced in Finland is used to satisfy Finlands demand. FI, SE3 and SE4 don't always have the same day ahead prices as SE1 and SE2. Electricity is harder to transport over large distances than you realise. If FI isn't coupled with SE1 or SE2 or their surplus of MW's might be transported somewhere else which depends on many factors. Every missing MW means prices in FI will go up. Moreover, the bids that producers submit are not linear. If DA prices are around 180 euros the next 300 MW's might increase the regulation price to 400 or even 600. You can go back to the the 12th of may and check the regulation price in FI. After that you can check the regulation volume. 167 MW's is not even 5% of the consumption in FI during the night.

Quality is emphasized in USA, by contractors, and the Pentagon.  Whether or not it is truly better higher quality is heavily leveraged for US military.  Every item the army uses has to have military airlift and a global supply line. 

 Pentagon hedges the bet with long range.  A platoon US infantry gets into an intense firefight all guns can turn that way.  Add naval artillery and loitering B1 bombers.  Howitzers can shoot all day and support many different platoons.  

The volume of explosives that can move down a rail line is hard to grasp.  100 tons per car, 30 cars per kilometer, 50 kilometers per hour.  The Hiroshima nuclear bombing was ""only"" 16 kilotons.  They cannot actually stage the unloading every 6 minutes.  

Long range guns could do counter battery.  Start picking off the enemy's artillery.  That adds up eventually.  The enemy cannot plow the field with explosives if their guns are broken.  Until either the guns are broken or the supply line is cut advancing infantry get massacred.  

People keep scoffing at the 152 mm howitzers.  The accuracy is high enough for a light breeze to effect aim more.  The quality and age of ammunition is also significant.  A 4 meter CEP is ""good enough"" since you do not want to be within 4 meters of a grenade that weighs a tenth of that shell.

 >The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. It is manufactured by the U.S. defence contractor Raytheon and derives its name from the radar component of the weapon system. The AN/MPQ-53 at the heart of the system is known as the ""Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target"" which is a backronym for PATRIOT. The Patriot system replaced the Nike Hercules system as the U.S. Army's primary High to Medium Air Defense (HIMAD) system and replaced the MIM-23 Hawk system as the U.S. Army's medium tactical air defence system.

I never said communism was better, I said they enacted a lot of these policies because of the red scare and that's a fact. McCarthyism started it and was a real and terrible thing. Even now you see the remains of it in the older generation and in the younger generation with Putin KGB style-strongman scares. Until a few months ago all everyone thought was how strong Russia is and how amazing Putin was as a leader and a tough Judo guy. Real fucking 4D chess here. It's all a facade. The only thing Russia was good at was political interference. Sop don't tell me the red scare wasn't a thing and still didn't linger long after the wall fell. 

What I said, and what you so deftly decided to ignore, was call out your bullshit by saying Cuba was one of the worst dictatorships. They simply aren't. Now, before you put words into my mouth again, I said no dictatorships were good for it's people so use your brain when responding. Today, and over the last 60 years, there have been dozens of far, far worse dictatorships than Cuba. Did I say Cuba was great? No. Are you assuming so? It sure the fuck sounds like it, and without merit. 

American foreign policy for the last 60 years has been a fucking disaster and either directly led to, or paved the way, for many horrible dictatorships, despots, and failed states. Castro was propped up for many of those years because they were aligned with the USSR, and under one of the heaviest and longest running US blockades.

I'd place about 3/4 of these people above Castro, conservatively, in terms of how oppressive and horrible they were:

About 250,000 Warsaw Pact troops (afterwards rising to about 500,000), supported by thousands of tanks and hundreds of aircraft, participated in the overnight operation, which was code-named Operation Danube. Romania and Albania refused to participate, while East German forces, except for a small number of specialists, were ordered by Moscow not to cross the Czechoslovak border just hours before the invasion. 137 Czechoslovak civilians were killed and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.

Explain?

When have I ever said it's been referenced in a ""serious manner""? My entire original point was that anyone who predicts such things is an ill informed clown.

As you've not linked any serious claims, the assumption at this point is that you've just imagined them. 

>Explain?

Already have, see above. 

>When have I ever said it's been referenced in a ""serious manner""? My entire original point was that anyone who predicts such things is an ill informed clown.

Consider the comment you replied to:

>Who has seriously suggested a collapse of the Russian offensive before now? Before the start of May, it was more a conversation about how long Ukraine could hold out, and the cost of Russia gaining ground.

It was always about people making serious claims of such. Unless you have the memory of a gnat, you should remember this. This entire conversation is in that frame, including the first post you made back to me regarding it. 

>These claims are literally all random minor comments that should be paid no heed. If you take this randomers Twitter thread as a serious analysis from a reputable source, you're quite simply a moron.

It seems the issue here is your extremely limited memory has led to you confusing my point, that there have been no serious claims to this point, with your own, then getting in a tizzy. That is, it seems that you outright forgot what we were discussing, so in your mind the point that was missing, ie 'serious claims' was filled with the point you started with earlier.",False,1652566524.0,t3_up90wa,t1_i8l821g,,3,0,0,0,0,0,
