Day 238 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was generally very quiet, other than the constant air raid alerts which at this point are almost always uneventful, which is a good thing. Actually right now the air raid sirens are kind of weird, because they start when Belgorod gets hit with something. Almost every time one starts posts about Russian air defense being active in Belgorod pop up, so in a way those air raid sirens are not for us, but for Russians.

I’m pretty sure 2 substations in Belgorod were destroyed just today, though Russians are not blaming us for those for some reason. First one was destroyed at 10:50am, and a second one at 7pm. When the second one was burning they said it happened because of a surge, and not because it was hit by something, though the people who were filming it burning down did say that they saw/heard a missile hitting it.

It looks like the first Iris-T system is in Kyiv, because people were posting photos with fragments of its missiles lying on the ground there. It also seems to be effective, because all of the missiles that were fired at Kyiv today were intercepted, which is great news, but we still need much more of the modern AA systems.

Then he went radio silence for about a week, right at the same time that information came out that he (and a bunch of other Russian mil-bloggers too) were under investigation for ""discrediting the armed forces of the Russian federation""

He went radio silence, but then reappeared with an ambiguous photo of himself in military uniform, later claiming that he has re-enlisted in  the Russian armed forces and will be going to Ukraine personally to lead a unit of unknown size. (and unknown location) he claims he could NEVER give away where hes fighting of course, or he would be too big of a target.

It has a decent start. Getting the audience up to speed with the latest development. But it doesn't take long to go off the rails. Highlights include:

1. 7 minutes in, The guest calls Russia losing the war an existential crisis (for Putin, not Russia) and therefore high risk of nuclear weapon.

2. The guest offers only ONE reason for Ukrainians wanting Crimea and the Donbas region back: a sense of injustice. Completely skips over the strategic and economic value of these regions.

3. The guest believes most people in Crimea identify as Russians...because Russia held it since 2014.

4. The guest emphasizes there are people in the White House, the Baltics, and Ukraine pushing for regime change in Russia. Implicitly saying they are forcing Putin into a corner and leading to use of nuclear weapons.

5. On nuclear blackmail: the guest calls not giving in to nuclear blackmail ""what a gamble"". Says there has to be some kind of restraint....from the side being blackmailed, that ""we have to negotiate"". Nevermind that there are many examples where the US and Russia were losing their wars and still didn't use nuclear weapons.

It's rather shocking that a major Canadian outlet invites a guest like this, and the host doesn't even try to challenge his view in any way.

Assuming Russian military discipline remains true to pattern, most of the Russians at the plant will be drunk by the end of the day.

From there I don't know if it'd be more advantageous to occupy the site and defend it, or just sabotage the artillery and leave...

... background: Aftermath (of **Project Hula**):

>Under U.S. law, **all ships transferred to foreign countries under Lend-Lease had to be returned to U.S. custody after the conclusion of World War II, and in February 1946**, the United States began negotiations with the Soviet Union, for the return of transferred ships. However, relations between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, deteriorated rapidly after the end of World War II, as the Cold War began, hindering the return of ships.

>Subtracting the five former LCI(L)s lost in combat and an auxiliary motor minesweeper that sank in 1945, 143 Project Hula ships were subject to return to the United States. On 7 March 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal, presented the United States Department of State with a list of 480 warships that the United States Department of the Navy wanted the Soviet Union to return, including all 28 patrol frigates transferred under Project Hula. In 1948, the Soviet Union finally agreed to return the patrol frigates, and it handed over 27 of them in October and November 1949; the 28th, EK-3, ex-USS Belfast (PF-35), had been driven aground and nearly sunk in a storm off Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, on 17 November 1948, was beyond economical repair, and was never returned, instead being scrapped in the Soviet Union, in 1960. Negotiations over the Department of the Navy's other major focus, the 25 surviving former LCI(L)s, dragged on longer, but in the end the Soviets returned 15 of them to the United States, in 1955. **By 1957, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence reported that of the 149 Project Hula ships, only 18 of those still in Soviet custody – nine minesweepers (AM), five submarine chasers (SC), and the four floating workshops (YR) – remained serviceable.**

Also, worth noting is that the Soviets stayed in the war for an extra 3 days after Japan surrendered to secure prizes—including the Kuril's.

>Japan formally surrendered to the Allies aboard the battleship USS Missouri (BB-63) in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, Soviet offensive operations continued until 5 September 1945, by which time Soviet forces had overrun the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in Manchuria, the northern half of Korea, the Japanese province of Karafuto on the southern half of Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands.",False,1666236809.0,t3_y7s931,t1_it0w007,,1,15,0,15,0,0,

> .1. 7 minutes in, The guest calls Russia losing the war an existential crisis (for Putin, not Russia) and therefore high risk of nuclear weapon.

We can't act on the idea that an authoritarian will consider it an existential crisis every time they don't get the toy they want for Christmas. As others have said, Putin has a strong survival will and pushing the metaphorical red button would be suicide on most levels.

>  .2. The guest offers only ONE reason for Ukrainians wanting Crimea and the Donbas region back: a sense of injustice. Completely skips over the strategic and economic value of these regions.

First, it's a violation of the UN charter and the Budapest agreement that Russia signed to unilaterally move borders. It opens up a can of worms for the whole world, not just for Ukraine. It also completely disregards the wishes of those living in those regions that want to remain in Ukraine. Now many of them have been driven out, supressed, moved to ""filtration"" camps, scared stiff, but their wishes still count. There is also a wider value of those regions for the rest of Ukraine.

For people living there, unhappy with the democratically elected leadership of Ukraine, they were welcome to move to Russia before the Russian invasion.

> .3. The guest believes most people in Crimea identify as Russians...because Russia held it since 2014.

If you kill, supress, force out everyone that isn't of a certain group then yes, everyone that remains will be of a certain group. If you look at the 1991 referendum for Crimea, there was a majority to stay in Ukraine. What does he think happened to that majority? Are they suddenly all Russians after a couple of years of occupation and how did that happen? (Also Crimean Tatars)

>  .4. The guest emphasizes there are people in the White House, the Baltics, and Ukraine pushing for regime change in Russia. Implicitly saying they are forcing Putin into a corner and leading to use of nuclear weapons.

Oh yes? People in democracies that have been trying to spread democracy for a centuary want authoritarian dictators to be replaced by proper democracy? Is this news to Putin? Since the invasion we have all urged the Russian people to do something about Putin, and if Putin doesn't like that, maybe he should treat his population better.

>  .5. On nuclear blackmail: the guest calls not giving in to nuclear blackmail ""what a gamble"". Says there has to be some kind of restraint....from the side being blackmailed, that ""we have to negotiate""

Giving in is a gamble too, one with much higher long term risks. Give in and every country on the planet will rush to equip themselves with nuclear weapons, and every current holder of nuclear weapons will start pushing their neighbours to give up land, money or other concessions.

They believe tactical nukes and to a lesser extent strategic nukes to be a necessary tool to make up for their diminished army. Russia considers them to be a valid option to use in a regional war.

Putin obviously doesn’t want to get NATO involved. But he might think they would stay out of Ukraine if he threatens to fire strategic nukes at the US and Europe, after launching a tactical nuke at Ukraine. 

I don’t think he would follow up on that threat but he might assume NATO would be too afraid to risk the fate of the world. 

That doesn’t mean it should prevent us from supporting Ukraine. I think that would actually encourage Putin to use Nukes as he would think NATO had backed off, and would unwilling to get involved. 

Again, I don’t think tactical nukes are likely to be used, but it’s not impossible especially if Putin feels Crimea is at risk. If he assumes he wouldn’t survive a humiliating defeat resulting in lost  “Russian territory” then he might risk it. 

Sadly I don’t think it would be unpopular decision with most Russians who believe Crimea to be a core part of Russia. They’ll just point to the US bombing of Japan and argue Russia should be able use nukes if the US can.

If Putin intends to use a nuke as a stop-loss tool, the order is inevitable because Ukraine is going to win this war. Whether the order will be carried out is not certain (soviet/Russian nuclear commanders have had cooler heads previously). If he does, it’s going to be a bad day to be in the Russian military because a lot of them are going to be dead. 

What is super unlikely is a mad situation for a few reasons. Between overwhelming nato power, the unknown state of Russias nuclear arsenal, and the fact most Russian nuclear commanders probably aren’t suicidal, mad is unlikely. 

So chill. It will either happen or it won’t. If it does it is unlikely to affect you directly. In the long run, dealing with one or two Russian nukes is going to a better outcome than capitulating to nuclear threats.",1666214731.0,1666212205.0,t3_y7s931,t1_iszcq3y,,1,0,0,0,0,0,

 >District heating (also known as heat networks or teleheating) is a system for distributing heat generated in a centralized location through a system of insulated pipes for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. The heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels or biomass, but heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, heat pumps and central solar heating are also used, as well as heat waste from factories and nuclear power electricity generation. District heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers.

That radiator usually has a temperature control on it to determine how hot you want the radiator to get.  In the places I've been this is usually just a basic 1-10 type of thing rather than a thermostat, but I'm sure some have those now.  So if you're too warm, just turn your radiators down or off, and if you're too cold you can increase them.

If, for some reason, you are still cold even with your radiator turned up, then you can of course buy yourself an electric space heater, but in my experience and that of my friends this has never been necessary unless you're someone who runs cold and likes a space heater on your feet under your desk as you work or something, which is something we do in the US too, so not specific to district heating.

Think of it this way if you're American or Canadian and used to central heating on a per home basis with a gas furnace.  Imagine that the city controlled when natural gas was pumped to your home.  On a set date each year the gas was turned on and you could begin using your furnace.  You were free to make it as warm or as cold as you want, just outside of those dates you didn't have a gas supply so the furnace wouldn't work.

 >The Hastert Rule, also known as the ""majority of the majority"" rule, is an informal governing principle used in the United States by Republican Speakers of the House of Representatives since the mid-1990s to maintain their speakerships and limit the power of the minority party to bring bills up for a vote on the floor of the House. Under the doctrine, the Speaker will not allow a floor vote on a bill unless a majority of the majority party supports the bill. Under House rules, the Speaker schedules floor votes on pending legislation.

First, it was 2:1, second, that is actually astoundingly accurate. Your conclusion that Nate silver called that election incorrect is completely wrong and based on an improper understanding of statistics. Nate Silver basically said the election was too close to call and basically anyone’s (and he was one of the few people to say that!). A one-in-three outcome is *barely* better than a coin flip (1:2). You essentially cannot predict a 1/3 outcome with an n of 1. You are thinking about those percentage values incorrectly.

The correct interpretation of five thirty eight’s stats was Hillary was *slightly* favoured to win but Trump winning was still an outcome with reasonably high probability.

Nate Silver called it right (in that it was too close to call)!

It’s basically the same situation with the house and senate - it could literally go either way because it’s much too close to call with any degree of reliability - remember that a 75% chance is 1 in every four, which is still too close to reliably call!

Article 54 [ Link ] -- Protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population

1. Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited.

2. It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to
move away, or for any other motive.

3. The prohibitions in paragraph 2 shall not apply to such of the objects covered by it as are used by an adverse Party:

(a) as sustenance solely for the members of its armed forces; or

(b) if not as sustenance, then in direct support of military action, provided, however, that in no event shall actions against these objects be taken which may be expected to leave the civilian population with such inadequate food or water as to cause its starvation or force its movement.

4. These objects shall not be made the object of reprisals.

5. In recognition of the vital requirements of any Party to the conflict in the defence of its national territory against invasion, derogation from the prohibitions contained in paragraph 2 may be made by a Party to the conflict within such territory under its own control where required by imperative military necessity.

What a ridiculous bollock. The difference is that under the current governement Poland  have always had free, democratic elections (as well as freedom of press etc.), and therefore it is a democratic country. Candidates from all the political parties have been always allowed to stand and campaign. Voters could always freely decide, who would rule the country. That's the essence of democracy.

On the other hand, neither Russia under Putin, nor Iran, let alone USSR, could be considered  a democracy, because none of them ever had free election.

USSR actually never had any elections, but only a spectacles, where citizens were required by the authorities to go to the local school and put a ""ballot"" into ""ballot box"", but without electing anybody, as  not only all the  ""candidates"" were appointed by the communist party, but also number of ""candidates"" was  always equal to the number of seats in the Supreme Council. So in fact, nobody was elected in this show, which served only propaganda purposes.

In Iran, there have been elections, but never free, as only candidates accepted by islamic clerics are allowed to stand. That's why Iran can't be considered democracy, as citizens aren't allowed to elect any candidate, who would be independent from mullahs.

And Putin's Russia is similar to Iran: only figures dependent on the regime have been allowed to participate in elections, while all the others were simply banned from participation under various pretexts. So Russia's elections haven't been free and democratic, as voters could never vote out Putin, and for exactly this reason Russia isn't democracy.

b5433bab7ba962f33fb1ce9d974bbf5b,y7s931,isyhig6,"""A recent in-depth study, which extensively utilizes postwar testimonies from Federal German investigations, has revealed much about the way in which German army units in Belarus, but particularly those of the 707th Infantry Division, became active components of the machinery of mass murder. The soldiers who were involved were rarely homicidal anti-Semites to start with. 

The men of the 707th, in particular, were too old to have undergone the especially extensive anti-Semitic conditioning to which their younger comrades had been subjected from school through the Hitler Youth, the RAD, and then the army. Yet they hailed from a society that possessed deep undercurrents of anti-Semitism from before 1933, and in which Nazi propaganda had largely succeeded in persuading the population that Jews were a social problem demanding a solution. 

Then, when the men commenced military service, the army itself got to work, seeking to ingrain within them a combination of Nazi ideology and ruthlessly utilitarian military thinking, and to reward the ‘radical’ violent action for which their conditioning had prepared them. Given how socially diverse the army’s enormous rank and file were, the army leadership could not realistically expect to indoctrinate all of them with equal thoroughness. Nevertheless, considering that so many soldiers expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in their letters, it seems that plenty were indeed receptive to extreme anti-Semitic conditioning.

 A further sign of this is that many senior field commanders had to issue warnings that witnessing or participating in mass executions might affect the troops’ discipline. For instance, Field Marshal von Rundstedt expressed no moral objection to the killings, but he did forbid his troops to ‘take matters into their own hands, participate in the excesses of the Ukrainian population against the Jews … \[or\] watch or photograph the measures being taken by the Sonderkommandos’.63 

Soldiers may have sought to attend executions primarily out of morbid curiosity, but ingrained anti-Semitism would have helped to make the notion morally acceptable to them. The vast majority of officers in the 707th’s units smoothly implemented murderous anti-Semitic directives, if not always with the same zeal as one another. The vast majority of their men complied, albeit reluctantly in numerous cases, even if they had the option not to. A few individuals, including one company commander on behalf of his unit, refused to participate in mass killing directly, though none was punished significantly; so much for veterans’ postwar exculpatory claims that refusing orders would have brought fearful consequences. 

A few soldiers, for personal or moral reasons one can only speculate upon, found it within themselves to help Jews in some way or other. For instance, some men of the 727th Infantry Regiment’s seventh company supplied false work permits to Jews; this was a relatively safe way of helping them evade a massacre of Jews who were deemed to have no economic value. Some soldiers used Jewish women, in direct contravention of Nazi racial laws, as a sexual outlet, but not all their relations with Jewish women were coercive.64 

However, hardly any individual refused to participate in guard duty, cordons or other forms of assistance to killing operations.""
