Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 31 May 2023.  


* Since the start of May 2023, Russia has increasingly ceded the initiative in the conflict and is reacting to Ukrainian action rather than actively progressing towards its own war aims.  

* During May 2023, Russia has launched 20 nights of one-way-attack uncrewed aerial vehicle and cruise missile attacks deep inside Ukraine.  

* Russia has had little success in its likely aims of neutralising Ukraine’s improved air defences and destroying Ukrainian counter-attack forces. On the ground, it has redeployed security forces to react to partisan attacks inside western Russia.  

* Operationally, Russian commanders are likely attempting to generate reserve forces and position them where they believe a Ukrainian counter-attack will occur.  

* However, this has probably been undermined by uncommitted forces instead being sent to fill gaps in the front line around Bakhmut.

**70 Occupiers killed**

> In Mikhailovka, after several ""arrivals"" at the school on [Pushkin Street](https://goo.gl/maps/24iMHesjDEQrfUxR7), the invaders suffered serious losses.

> For two days, Ukraine targeted the lair of the invadersin Mikhailovka—the Russian military stored ammunition in the dining room and gym at the school, sometimes even spent the night. The parking lot adjacent to the school building and the market also had arrivals.  There had been cars driven by Russians parked there.

>  On May 29, there were three sequential explosions. Then, later, an even more powerful fourth single explosion.  At midnight, four more explosions rang out. 

> According to local residents, after all these explosions, the Russians were very frightened and it appeared that many of them fled towards Melitopol ‘in a panic.’ The hospital in Melitopol is overflowing with wounded invaders. The local population is urgently forced to give blood for the wounded Russian soldiers. As for the losses, they report that 70 invaders became ""good Russians"" and went to the Kobzon concert [euphemism for killed]. 

> > “The day's work on the [Russians] didn't go quite the way we all would like,” our defenders report. “The Russians suffered mostly 300 [injuries], unfortunately there was no direct hit. However, they fled like it was their final moments, some as far as Melitopol. But . . .  There was at least one parcel successfully delivered to the address. It is now verified—up to 70 Russians became good [euphemism for killed]. The blood collection that was organized today, as you know, is far from ‘planned,’ and even forced. Ambulances transported 300s to Melitopol all day long.”

That appears to be the aim.  They are provoking us to do the same.""

Concurrently in the news, I'd think it needless to say, there have been scores of missile sightings, interceptions, and strikes over Kyiv.

One needs to be careful about leaning too much on this angle, since we know that strategic bombing campaigns far from the frontlines in civilian areas generally end up being counter productive. For every person who panics about ""war coming home"" you get several more who demand revenge and become determined to fight to the bitter end. That is true both for the common people (though those are irrelevant for Putin anyway) and for the elites. We've seen that play out again and again since WW2, it's the same mistake Russia did attacking Ukrainian cities, and it's why the possibility that it was a false flag seems to make so much sense.

Now, there's also the morale boost on the Ukrainian side from showing that you can strike at the heart of the enemy, the fact that it forces Russia to keep AD resources far from the front, and reports indicate that the strikes were aimed at legitimate military targets. But Moscow was clearly chosen for the symbolic value and I believe it would be a mistake to waste too many resources in strikes like this. They can have opposite the effect on enemy morale, and there are almost certainly better targets like airports, troop concentration points, etc. that Ukraine already showed to be capable of identifying.",False,1685534624.0,t3_13wbphu,t3_13wbphu,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Some studies estimate about 10,000 civilians were deliberately murdered by American personnel, though that doesn't account for negligent civilian deaths caused by bombings, artillery, and chemical after-effects. It's difficult to tell because of the complexity in counting these things, so the studies on that are all over the place, ranging from 30,000 to 250,000+ civilians who died from American weapons.

The US did a much better job cleaning up its act and policing civilian killings in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but notably, we had to choose to do that ourselves. The bomber pilots who killed hundreds of thousands of women and children in Vietnam have never been prosecuted, and never will be.

So to normalize Ukraine's ability to strike inside Russia it is better to have other nations that do not have that reputation to be the more hawkish on this point and vocally support Ukraine. This stance is to give Russia and people that oppose aid less ability to say ""well the US is just back to its usual warmongering ways.""

An example of why the US is taking this tactic is to look at the air campaign against Ghadaffy in Libya. The US wasn't the one that started bombing, didn't want to be involved in it at first and didn't want to organize it as they knew it would then look like more US imperialism in the wake of Afghanistan and Iraq. Then their allies ran out of bombs, had trouble deconflicting the airspace between each other and essentially begged the US to come on board which they did. Now fast-forward a decade or so and many people with anti American views refer to the ""US air campaign against Libya,"" I've seen it on reddit a bunch of times and phrasing that way gives a completely distorted view of what happened.

So while it might seem the US is being unhelpful not supporting Ukraine on strikes inside Russia they are actually doing so to try and help. It seems counter-intuitive but the US knows how it is viewed and is taking that into account to come up with the best public relations strategy for Ukraine, and that is for the US to not appear to be leading the charge to strike within Russia's borders.

It's a central hub and doesn't have the psychological importance that Mariupol has to the Russians. This is important, in my opinion, because there would less of a desire to fight to the death for the city. Once you take that city, you push southwest to Henichesk, the seat of the Russian occupation in Kherson. 

I don't think trying a Dnipro river crossing is smart, but it would not be needed if you take Henichesk. That would mean the only route for supplies into occupied Kherson would be through the Isthmus of Perekop and you can really threaten supply lines. This would likely force Russia to withdraw similar to how they had to from the right bank of the Dnipro and Kherson city thanks to their inability to get enough supplies over the river.

Mariupol would obviously be a huge to retake for Ukraine, as would retaking any territory the DPR has held since 2014, but Russia is not going to give up the city without a huge fight. That means Ukraine would need to surround the city and cut it off from all three sides and siege it, slowing down any offensive.

Instead of a complete focus on Zaporizhzhia, it may make sense to have a second offense then push into Luhansk towards Svatove. But who really knows what the plan is. There are a number of different ways this could go and I think a strong case can be made for many of them.

The best actual explanation I have is that the Russian power mindset has a very different, fundamentally different, approach to the idea of truth in information. Not using information as a weapon is considered a mistake and a weakness. So lying is not expected it is demanded and casual. Putin wishes to portray Russia as a victim and the actual facts do not matter. He knows the facts, with the caveat that his people will lie to him to make themselves look good or victimize a rival.

Mobilized men are already forced to crowdsource their own body armour and gear, and being sent to the slaughter with only four magazines of rifle ammo, for antiquated weapons. Where are they suddenly going to get millions of rifles, hundreds of millions of munitions, and thousands of tanks to actually make good use of the manpower? Where are they going to get the trainers? It would take them 10 years of committed war footing, martial law and a total war economy to recover their strength to the point where a mobilization would have any meaningful effect.

The only thing mobilization would achieve for Russia is cause mass panic among the population, only to send unprepared, unequipped men to die before even seeing combat. The logistics of a mass mobilization are insane, its unlikely Russia even has the social and physical infrastructure to pull one off. 

Even if they succeeded in mobilizing, training, and arming a million men - with the knowledge that they are going to be sent into a suicidal meat grinder with no guarantee of success, with no clear ideological rhyme or reason behind it, Putin would only be manufacturing the means to overthrow himself.

The average Russian isn’t going to weigh that into their emotional response, on top of that look at what Russia has done and how it has driven the Ukrainian population to dig in their heels and fight.

Sf infantry wet teams will cross no man's land under cover of darkness, take out the sentries and front line troops, hopefully quietly without an alarm being raised ( the night is dark and full of terrors)

Engineers will move to clear paths through the minefields and create crossings for anti tank obstacles

Sf will seize key bridges and junctions in the rear

Light and armoured columns will then pour through the gaps and into the rear areas

The artillery will remain silent until the alarm is raised in the enemy lines at which point it will open up on pre registered targets ( artillery, command posts, ammo dumps, troop concentrations etc )

Of course no plan survives first contact with the enemy and flexibility will be key",False,1685566136.0,t3_13wbphu,t1_jmdvyth,,2,20,0,20,0,0,

How, exactly, is China supposed to blockade a port without shooting at Taiwanese vessels? And how, exactly, are they going to continue such a blockade once Taiwan has sunk every Chinese ship within Taiwan's coastal waters?

And that's before getting to step two. The part where America says, ""we don't recognize your blockade, our American ships will be entering Taiwan as we see fit. With a couple hundred aircraft in the air over Okinawa, armed and ready to go. Please feel free to start a war with us though, if that's what you really want.'

Quite simply, there is no such thing as a blockade that isn't part of a shooting war. You can't force ships to stop any other way.

Putin has directly overseen the murder of at least hundreds of thousands of people in his career, and if we include indirect deaths, God knows how many died as a result of his decisions. He has overseen the kidnapping of scores of children and the attempted erasure of the Ukrainian culture. He presides over a kleptocratic mafia state that has disenfranchised and impoverished huge swathes of the Russian population, and spent decades using every tool of information warfare to beat any sign of dissent or opposition into death, torturous prison, exile, or pure terrified silence. He uses these tools to interfere in democracy abroad and has a mission to divide and disassemble the West, so he can restore a Russocentric Empire over Eurasia and exploit its people (again) for the enrichment of himself and his old KGB buddies. 

Navalny used some ethnic slurs, espoused some ridiculous nationalistic beliefs, and took his sweet time coming round on the Crimean question (which he eventually did). He has since renounced many of these beliefs and admitted that the things he's said in the past were inappropriate. But on top of those bad things, he has always been a staunch and unwavering advocate against corruption and authoritarianism, and has put actions behind his words in exposing the crimes of the Russian mafia state.

I very strongly doubt that. The gulf between what's said publicly and what's said privately isn't as large as people think. Not in general, and certainly not since Cablegate in 2010. Diplomatic meetings aren't usually filled with off-the-cuff comments or private promises. They're readouts of policy positions that have been checked and cross-crosschecked and circulated among half a dozen agencies before they leave a diplomat's mouth.

The risk that Russia would intercept a document, a communication, or a recording of a discussions encouraging or giving approval to directly attack Russia's internationally recognized territory with their donated weaponry would be too high. It would be a casus belli that allows Russia to shore up domestic political support for its effort, and a justification to retaliate at a time and place of their choosing.

Cutting them off is going to be the hard part, and Russia will fight very hard to prevent that.

They'll never be fully cut-off, either, since Russia is a 30 miles boat ride from Mariupol and Russia has naval superiority. They wouldn't be able to supply the city indefinitely, but they could extend the time they're able to hold out for.

> It wouldn't have to be besiged immediately. It's actually better for Ukraine if the Russian troops try to make a break for it in the open fields. Besieging is a job that can be done by conscripts and militia with minimal training.

There's no easy path to the city from Vuhledar, though. So even getting to it is going to be a huge challenge. Once there, if you don't cut off the city immediately, you'll allow weapons and soldiers to flood in to the city. I highly doubt Ukraine wants to see further destruction of the city, if possible. They'd rather not see it become another Bakhmut.

From a strategic standpoint, taking Melitopol accomplishes the same goal. I understand it's not as symbolic, but it'd be a huge strategic victory.

That's a shaky assumption.  For one, the west has a habit of returning their focus to internal issues the moment it becomes convenient to.  For two, the west aren't going to invest military resources, so violent instability will be solved by which ever local strongman quells it.  For three, most investment by the west will be from corporations, not from governments, and corporations really don't care whether a government is a liberal democracy or not, so long as it pays them.  Many corporations prefer totalitarian regimes to liberal democracies.  For four, other countries in the region, specifically China, but not only China, will also be investing in these new states.
