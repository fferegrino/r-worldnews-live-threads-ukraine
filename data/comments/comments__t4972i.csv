* Russia has been underperforming when it comes to their military objectives - the intelligence community seems to unanimously agree on this.
* Economic sanctions have decimated the Russian currency and economy within days, and it looks like more sanctions are going to appear in the following days all around the world.More and more Russian oligarchs and citizens are starting to speak out against this invasion.
* China, India, and UAE seem to be the major world powers refusing to condemn this invasion, and in some cases these countries have been providing tacit avenues for the Russia to mitigate the effects of these sanctions, while in other cases their banks seem to be sanctioning Russian assets in line with Western banks.
* Negotiations for peace have begun, progress on these negotiations is confidential.
* Despite the sanctions and negotiations, it looks like Putin and Russia are determined to ramp up military operations against Ukraine in the following days.
* There's been a lot of vocal and material support for Ukraine among EU and NATO member nations, but there are no guarantees of Ukraine joining either of the two within a short timeframe.
* Majority of sources from US and EU intel seem to believe Putin is bluffing when it comes to the nuclear option, although there have been some opinions that Putin could possibly be losing it when it comes to mental stability.
* Direct military intervention on behalf of Ukraine does not seem likely from any nation thus far, but Ukraine has been receiving substantial amounts of military and humanitarian aid on a daily basis.
* Putin and Russia are unlikely to secure any of their main geopolitical goals before the invasion began, so right now it seems to be a matter of stubbornness and face for Putin.
* The heroic resistance of Ukraine's president and people has united the world's liberal alliance to a degree not seen for decades.
* Edit: Russia continues to gaslight and bullshit to unbelievable degrees, and troll farms continue to operate in full force, but at least Western governments and tech companies seem to be aggressively taking them down.
* Edit 2: Constant reports of Russian war crimes continue to happen on a daily basis, of course, how did I forget to include that.

Anything else of major importance that I've missed ?

However the actions of one despot brought the world together in a manner not seen since World War 2. Yes it's not perfect and the day is not won. Ukraine is fighting a hard battle and many countries are doing what they can to support them.

But if the best situation happens as a result of this entire horrible conflict not only will we see the potential fall of an Oligarchy, we will see the rise of a new EU/NATO nation (Ukraine), the tightening of ties within the EU and NATO, and the growth of international relations no one has ever seen in their life time. The type of ties and relations our world needs to fight larger looming disasters such as Climate Change.

While I realize it may be foolishly optimistic, and the next couple years have me pessimistic, the following decades may actually be something remarkable for humanity.

That's all my foolish optimism.",1646145719.0,1646145546.0,t3_t4972i,t3_t4972i,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

Guys, if Putin wanted to aggresively use nukes he wouldn't make this huge complex war to justify it, he would just make direct threats about NATO and invade one of those countries.

His only objective is to decapitate Ukraine and install a puppet state. He's done this same process it's SOP at this point, excet Ukraine is a much bigger fish and is putting up far more resistance than Putin expected.

Putin and the Kremlin are obsessed with polling, which is why they still hold elections and actually have lofty goals for the election. For example the 2018 election, the Kremlin was aiming for the 70/70 ratio: 70% voter turnout and 70% of the votes to Putin which was a pretty tough ask considering voter turnout was looking bleak. But anyway Putin is calibrated to the polls and he tests to see what people respond to, but many of his actions are huge gambles that often had to no solidified plan and required him to play it by ear. Historically a lot of these gambles ended up paying off in the short term like the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia tampering with US elections in 2016. These things bolstered Putin's popularity temporarily but the issue was his philosophy was to deal with the consequences later, should there ever be consequences. And there was consequences which made Russia a ticking time bomb. Putin is a prisoner to the system he built up in Russia because he has no successor, and while Russia is on a path of degression, any reform cracks the system, so essentially he has no exit plan and he has no choice but to stay in power as long as he can. This brings us to current day where Putin's popularity is rapidly declining because his gamble in waging war is failing and the current new sanctions is becoming a death sentence for Russia's economy when the older sanctions were hardly even properly addressed previously. The Ukranian War perhaps isn't even a miscalculation because a lot of Putin's earlier successes weren't calculated measures in the first place, they were more gambles that so happened to more or less work out. Now that even the oligarchs are speaking out against the war, Russia is in limbo because even if Putin is removed, he is just one small piece of the puzzle. But I don't even see Putin being removed anytime soon anyway, I believe this just ensures he won't be reelected which does give time for Russia to produce a state backed canididate.",False,1646147386.0,t3_t4972i,t3_t4972i,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Meanwhile here on Reddit, authentic Sanders subreddits became overrun by ""Russiagate / Anti-Russophobia"" peddlers toeing an incredibly Pro-Russian / Anti-American line — engaging in the sort of Gaslighting Whataboutism the Russian Troll Farms (e.g., IRA) and FSB have as textbook tactics. Other subs like Way of the Bern or Kossacks for Sanders were even more blatant launching-points for right-wing groups and Russian-apologists masquerading as Sanders supporters. Unfortunately some legitimate supporters drank the vodka, here, as well.

I further want to bring attention to the likes of Glenn Greenwald's (Former UK Guardian journalist following Snowden, Intercept founder) descent into this narrative; and it strikes me as odd on hindsight how both Greenwald and Snowden fled to Moscow, and Greenwald increasingly took up this pro-Russian / Anti-American narrative in kind. It was a stark contrast to his previous years and he became more...Unhinged interviews he'd give. https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712173436/police-in-london-arrest-julian-assange-after-ecuadorean-embassy-evicts-him

Just a few days-ago Greenwald was on Fox News, pushing a both-sides narrative seemingly in an attempt to muddy the waters. https://video.foxnews.com/v/6299015942001

To me, either they were Russian assets all along, or they bit off more than they could chew and became severely blackmailed while remaining in Russia. If you read Luke Harding's work in Russia and his reporting on the Polonium Poisoning, this shouldn't come as a surprise. Greenwald essentially went from being a respectable Journalist to an attorney to Snowden and an outright activist/apologist for Russia in many instances.

To me it seems pretty clear there is a concerted effort from right-wing extremist groups and pro-Russian groups to drive a wedge within the progressive coalition with this issue, chiefly to fragment the Democrats while simultaneously promoting Trump and Republicans. (And that's coming from someone who was ardently opposed to Neoconservative invasion of Iraq in 2003).

(Friendly reminder that Putin pushed for Trump's reelection; perhaps in part because Trump both publicly and privately embraced the idea of not just de-funding NATO but withdrawing from it, entirely. Also that the NRA was a laundering-point for Russian money, and that Russian money was flowing into Republican campaigns).

In other words, we'll pay more no matter what happens to crude prices and it's not oil companies taking advantage.

edit: more on to grains

Ukraine is major supplier of corn and grains, likewise this conflict will hit 20% of Ukraines corn and grain production. Asia and Europe will see massive food inflation.

Russia will suffer the most with the Ruble collapsing. Wheat will be 40% more expensive as production drops in Ukraine. Russia will respond by stopping grain exchanges in Russia. Don't know what this will do.

Fertalizer cost, Urea? is going up with NG prices. Europe will not have access to enough nitrogen dropping european farming yields.

Do you guys want me to continue?


THis won't be too bad for the consumer as the consumer as gasoline/energy expenditure is 3.2% of disposable income which is much lower then 2014 and less then half of the 1970s.

there will be a supply response, you will see capex increases in the USA and more US and Canadian production come online. It could take a year - (me personally I don't see this, as  producers in NA will see this is a temproary situation).

US CPI, excluding energy, is up ~6% for total core, with goods up 11% and services up 3%

Current elevated period of inflation could last much longer because of this conflict, with a fiar bit higher inflation then 2%.

The effects of this conflict will push inflation from goods to services ( i don't get this).

CPI is no longer confied to idiosyncratic categories. This is a challenge for the feds - they can't just react with holding rates back.

Full emploeyment is acheived, no flexiblity in policy to respeond to this.

""Everything they can help us with now - it's better to help now than find themselves eye to eye with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin later,"" Kuleba told an online news conference.

""No need to fear that NATO will find itself at war with Russia because of Ukraine. If Russia wins - you are next.""

2) Once every news organization around the world sees Russian troops and  tanks in Maidan Square and prints that on their front pages, that is when Putin can start to spin a win and begin *genuine* negotiations.

There are people claiming that people are Russian bots/trolls for condemning Ukraine's action at the borders.There was/is clear evidence of racism near the border. That is a fact. Reputable news sources and interviews/videos suggest it.That doesn't mean you can't support Ukraine. What Russia is doing is flat out wrong.It's almost like bad actions should be frowned upon no matter what country commits it.

It's actually laughable how obvious their attempts are now, I'm actually in shock. Russia have honed their cyber dissent skills on the basis of sowing discord amongst the Western powers but it's as if they haven't adapted for the current situation. 

In the early days of the invasion, the Russian misinformation was utterly predictable and you could spot it from a mile away. It was boring statements like ""Ukrainian leadership flee Kyiv"" with a bit of shite mixed in like ""lol Kyiv will fall by Sunday"" (saw **a lot** of that latter one). 

Now, they're trying to be clever but in an interesting twist; the West (governments and citizenry) are so united in their opinion that they stick out like a sore thumb. You'll often see thinly veiled comments of ""concern"" which are actually attempts at Russian trolling but they get immediately shut down because they're now so commonplace, obvious and opposite to the shared opinion of almost everyone here.

But if Russia invaded Ukraine and we give them stinger missiles, that's helping Ukraine defend their nation.

So at some point if Russia takes enough cities and Ukraine becomes Russia, we reach a point where arming their resistance is the same as giving missiles to the renegade group in Moscow in the first paragraph of this comment. 

I don't know when and how that line is crossed. I think the trick is that even if Kyiv falls, their president needs to go to exile and set up a temporary government and continue to dispute the taking of Ukraine politically. 

But there seems to be some tipping point at which even if the people want to fight the occupation, it will be hard for the west to help without it being an act of war. 

It's shades of grey, to be sure. Even now helping them is like pretty damn close to being at war along side them, but that crossover seems to be important.

Honestly though, it's true.  There is a world economic war going on, but Russia doesn't have anything on its side. No power-hungry fascists will align with it because they are clearly losers.  The only people who are supporting are those still in Putin's bubble or who are still somehow afraid of him.

It makes me wonder if there has been a lot more work going on behind the scenes to undo that capability in the last few years.

This is a great legal question! For background, I'm an attorney so I can help explain the problem with this memorandum. Without getting super deep into the woods, contracts of any kind, including treaties, have a bunch of moving parts, but two of the most important moving parts are the Promises and the Enforcement Mechanism. 

Promises are what each signatory to the contract/treaty is promising to do, while Enforcement Mechanism is what happens if the promise is violated or not followed through. So as you know, the Ukraine promised to give up the nuclear weapons in return for the promises of security from Russia, Great Britain, and America (not France though). However, the enforcement mechanism for this promise, directly quoted, is ""to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.""

Here is the problem with the treaty. The only enforcement mechanism in this treaty is that those parties will immediately seek a UN Sec. Council action to provide assistance, but it gives no other ACTUAL promise of defense from any of those countries. The UN is an impotent organization in terms of preventing armed conflict by motivated actors (although its pretty good at preventing and resolving conflict when parties don't actually want to go to war.) And yes, as per this treaty, there was a vote recently to stop the war in the UN Sec. Council, but it was veto'd by Russia. 

Hope this clarifies for you!

There's a lot more to this, Putin hasn't gone ""all in"" despite being sanctioned to hell, and the same thing happened to Russia with the Afghanistan war, sanctions alone won't sway him and he's said as much, that basically ""the west has not only been sanctioning but making aggressive threats"" which we aren't, it's propaganda

As for right wing movements, most western countries have some sort of right wing issues.

Sadly, it seems like Eastern European states have had more than its fair share of these extremists the last years, however if you look further into it, so have other countries. From the top of my head, some Australian (or was it US) units was caught waving the Swastika banner from vehicles in Syria. In Germany there has been several incidents where the government has cracked down on extremists amongst their military and special police/ forces. And yes, Ukraine also has extremists amongst their ranks.

These are the **outliers** though. They are not representative of the system they are part of.

Also (and don't trust me on this, verify it by looking up good sources), I believe Ukraine has 4 political parties which are considered ""far right"".  Out of these 1 is represented in their parliament with 1 representative total (again, please verify this from other sources than me).

So no - in short, while extremists exist in every country - Ukraine included - that does not mean they are supported by the government.

The venn diagram between Neo-Nazis and people buying into Russian Propaganda is almost a circle; and these people, at least initially, were formed out of people from the regions of Ukraine that Russia's been trying to stir up trouble in.  Even if Nazis weren't objectively terrible people, that seems like an incredibly questionable decision from a national security standpoint.  I don't know how you could trust them.

With that said, Russia's employing Neo-Nazi groups as well (they literally have one trying to kill the Ukranian President) and one side of this conflict is intentionally killing civilians.  That needs to actually have strong action taken against it and the world is finally doing something about it.  (For the whataboutism on ""Well why weren't you upset about other conflicts!"" - I, personally, have always had a problem with war and I've never been shy about calling it out).

I think if the Ukranian government can survive this war they need to be pushed hard to continue to become less corrupt/throw out this one particular group and otherwise become better.  But nobody is perfect and they're hardly the greater evil here.  And deciding to refuse to choose the lesser of two evils in this case is supporting the greater evil, whether you believe you are or not.  And Russia is a threat to the world.  That group is just a threat to Ukraine.

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/27/vasili-arkhipov-soviet-submarine-captain-who-averted-nuclear-war-awarded-future-of-life-prize

Military personal & intelligence agencies have back channels precisely to stop Nukes from flying.  

Mutually assured destruction means that if Putin wants to Pull the trigger he has to launch a global scale strike that successfully cripples the potentially for retaliation... its not possible. If he fires a 1 nuke, he has to be a peace with crawling out of his bunker to rule over a pile of ash and the die shortly after. 

Essentially, I think Putin has miscalculated. He thought that because of the THREAT of Nukes, the west would want to avoid a WW3 scenario with Russia & so would stand back and let him reclaim the soviet union country by country... 

In reality that isn't happening, and he has massively underestimated how tough of an opponent Ukraine is and how united the west is against 'another Hitler'. 

In reality, this is WW3 already, but it is currently being fought with Economics (sanctions and aid).      
The west has learnt from WW2 and so is effectively trying to ""stop the Nazis in Poland"" before they can gain momentum and it escalates to other countries... and they are looking to do so economically. Also all other countries neighbouring Russia also don't want to be next on the list hence its vert close to being Russia vs the world. 

For me the real question as to whether this escalates into a Military WW3, and the key factor there is whether the Russian people would prefer to rise up and overthrow Putin or die on his battlefields. If they've learnt their history you'd think they'd understands they have better odds opting for an uprising ASAP. But we'll see.

This goes without saying. You can support Ukraine and their fight for freedom while also calling out abhorrent racism, regardless of where it comes from.  


However, you need to be very careful in the line your treading here. It is equally likely that these African men were refused access to the trains because all men were refused, as the trains are apparently for only women and children to flee.  


However, we also know that racism exists absolutely everywhere in the world. We're a species that's plagued by tribalism - fear of the other. And its  equally likely that these human beings were denied access because of the color of their skin.  


Each option there, or a combination of the  two are still heart breaking and shouldn't be happening.

Putin wants Russia to have a relevance in the world and have a sphere of influence. He is between China and the EU/NATO. The latter has gradually crept closer to what he feels is Russia's sphere of influence. I'm sure there is also pride in there, the desire for Russia to be not just relevant but a true world power like the USSR was.

Russia wants countries to be in its orbit to maintain its place as a major world power. In absence of making aggressive moves it looks like Russia will instead orbit around China or EU long term. They don't have the gravitas to be the major player on the world stage the USSR was. 

They have now completely burned any trust the western world has in integrating them more into Europe. Even with a regime change I don't know how quickly this invasion can be put behind people's view of Russia.

What are the long term implications?

I can bring an example. Estonia at the end of 1930s accepted the deal with Soviet Union for its bases, because our leadership was told that it was either annihilation or bases and our leadership thought that this way at least people will survive. Well, Soviets deported 10K of people in 1941 and 20K in 1949 - just from Estonia, I know the numbers for Latvia and Lithuania were even bigger due to having more population. Between 80K-100K people became refugees, many never returned because of age, because of being too small when they left, because of assimilation, because of the very very vast difference between the Estonia they left behind and the devastation that had occurred during the half a century of absence. In the end, we ended up being either dead, deported, refugees or annexed for 50 years anyway and many are still extremely bitter, even young people, thinking that maybe we could’ve fought back.

Because Finland fought back and kept its independence, however curtailed it was. 

In 1930s, Estonia was only a little bit behind Finland in developments, our GDP per capita were close. 
In 1991 when we restored our independence, the difference was that Estonia had GDP per capita of about 10-15% of Finland (numbers vary a bit but the difference was huge).",1646148702.0,1646148516.0,t3_t4972i,t1_hyx3ivi,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

In Georgia and most red states, if you are the incumbent red (republican) and you are running against a Democrat, you don't even have to campaign, because most Republicans here will never vote for a Democrat even if they know nothing about either candidate. So our governor, by choosing her to fill the seat in the one loophole that can seat a senator without a vote, was trying to set her up for a dynasty.

Fortunately she spoke too much and gave people reasons to tear her apart. If she had just kept her mouth shut she'd have used us as her ladder to affect US policy but instead she got rightfully labeled as a carpetbagger who just moved here to hunt a senate seat.

Forgive me, I (like many of us I wager) am new to international politics, but what I’m gathering is this. The UN can’t do anything because Russia is on the Security Council, and they will veto any action. Additionally, NATO’s hands are tied because Ukraine is not in NATO.

12becc6ac393e8f68fcff21a5a85e085,t4972i,hyxcdzv,">Yes. This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you. So basically, the UK and US fulfilled the Enforcement Mechanism by bringing this to the UN, but it’s a non-starter because it only took one veto (Russia) to block it. What a joke. There should be a clause in future treaties like this to block the aggressor country from vetoing.

Yup, it is most definitely a messed up thing. For context, when this treaty was signed, Russia looked like it was on its way to becoming a democratic nation. There was no Putin. Boris Yeltsin was in charge, and Russia and Ukraine were like sibling nations, in the same way that maybe the US and Canada is. I guess this seemed good enough at the time. In the future, I doubt signatories to these types of treaties will make this same mistake again.

>The UN can’t do anything because Russia is on the Security Council, and they will veto any action.

This is correct. Even if they didn't, China might as well.

>Additionally, NATO’s hands are tied because Ukraine is not in NATO. Even outside the threat of nuclear war, my understanding is NATO’s role is defense and not offense anyway. Is that accurate?

That's correct. Part of the reason for Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 was to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, as NATO has a longstanding policy of not letting in any nation that currently has border conflicts. Its not like a hard and fast rule, but NATO does this to prevent war, since if it lets in a nation that is under attack, it will have to defend that nation.

NATO was originally envisioned for defense, that is correct. That doesn't mean that is incapable of taking offensive action, it can do so by agreement with the member nations (a very recent example was the no-fly zone established in Libya) but it will not come to Ukraine's defense in this case. A huge reason is that we know Russia's military's doctrine against the West is to use tactical nuclear weapons to even the score. 

Conventionally, NATO would demolish Russia and its armed forces. We have more stuff, all our stuff is better, and all the people using that stuff is very well trained compared to the Russian forces. So Russia will allow its commanders to use nuclear weapons to even the score. The rationale is simple: If you are going to lose the war anyway, what do you have to lose by using nuclear weapons? Their thinking is that as long as Russia does not strike any cities, there will be no overwhelming American nuclear response, only limited nuclear exchanges back. And Russia has A LOT more nukes and A LOT more land than Europe, so they will win the limited nuclear exchange.

Of course, the problem with this is that once the nukes go flying, you are on a razor's edge of global thermonuclear war. One mistaken bombing run, one targeting computer breaks, one bad decision means that a city gets hit, so we respond by nuking their cities, and all of a sudden, the ICBM's are flying.

Our leaders feel pretty sure that Putin will resort to nukes if pushed, which means that they have to stay out.",False,1646151079.0,t3_t4972i,t1_hyx7yb6,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

The population was given weeks of notice that the invasion is imminent and the US was guaranteeing their freedom and safe movement from Fallujah to other locations.   The second operation was a resounding success of a siege.  I know I was at Gold and participated in the planning, execution, sweeping of and the reestablishment of the civilians over the next year. 

The first occupation of Fallujah was by the Iraqi Security forces and a few defense contractors (Black Water) in March 2004.  It was a total failure and the corrupt fledgling Iraqi Security Forces and ineffective self rule created far too large of power vacuums.  This lead to a mistrust of the govt (even more than original Saddam) and the ability of the US to be peace keepers.  Mind you we were in the middle of a war and peace keeping cities that were ""cleared"" of uniformed military was the job of the local governments... mistake #572.

The ""siege"" was about 2 weeks (depending on when you want to start the clock).  The original Operation Phantom Fury - the second invasion of Fallujah was the 7th of November 2004.

If one's used, people *will* know. The type of damage it causes is very distinct.

This is, at its heart, a staring contest on the political level. The motivation for Russia's invasion is multifold, and this staredown with NATO is part of it. It's very possible that Russia didn't expect this level of response, and now reckons that it has no choice other than to stick with the plan to keep its narrative. The sad reality is that Ukraine is the proxy for NATO in this particular case. Everyone involved knows it. It's part of the point, in fact.

Understand that, beyond the smoke screen of the media, the people who are making decisions are not stupid. Nobody actually wants continent (or further) wide escalation. Russia is continuing with its plan because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more they lose, the more they can paint themselves as a victim to their allies and to their people home.

The defensive mobilization is just that, DEFENSIVE, it's to protect against attacks on member territories, NATO will not be pulled into a full war unless Russia attacks a NATO countries territory. If a Nato country placed troops in Ukraine to help, they would be on their own. Also, there is such a thing as scale of response, a lot of people seem to think that if one shell falls on Nato territory they are obligated to immediately deploy all of their troops to invade Russia or something, but nobody is exactly eager to do that for obvious reasons lol. If there is an accident that spills over onto NATO soil, they will publically denounce it and bluster about increasing the readiness of their military. Even if an invasion is launched on Nato, they will fight tooth and nail back to the borders of NATO and probably not much further, because it is a defensive pact.
