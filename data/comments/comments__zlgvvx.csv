Day 294 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today some missile strikes did happen, so it was a bit less quiet than usual. At around 11:35pm we heard some explosions, about a minute later an air raid alert was triggered and that was when we realized that the explosions were from Russian missiles. We didn’t have any prior warnings, so the missiles were most likely launched from some unusual place, probably somewhere deeper in Belgorod oblast.

Some missiles were apparently intercepted by our air defense, but some did make it through and landed somewhere not too far from Kharkiv. There were reports of electricity being cut in some places in Kharkiv oblast, so Russians were most likely aiming for our energy infrastructure as usual. Our air defense is definitely getting better/more skilled, as today 13 Shaheds were fired at Kyiv in the morning and not a single one made it through. Also, a bit later in the day another batch of Shaheds were fired at Odesa, but all of those were intercepted as well, our AA is getting really good at shooting them down.

Today there were more explosions in Kursk and Bryansk oblasts, apparently, we targeted their military bases again. Russians reported that everything was intercepted as usual, but there are videos showing big explosions happen on the ground, so something was definitely hit. Actually, those missile strikes that were aimed at Kharkiv might have been a retaliation for hitting their military bases, but unsurprisingly they are retaliating against civilians every time their military targets get hit.

Russians would provide children with water only for two days, and then would starve them making them believe that they had been abandoned by their parents.

>...

>He added that in the town of Balakliya the torture chambers were located opposite each other. One 14-year-old boy had been kept inside for 90 days.

>According to Lubinets, >!the boy was cut with a knife and metal was heated and applied to various parts of his body. “Several times he was led out to be shot, only to hear a shot above his head. He could hear the screams of men and women being tortured around the clock,”!< the spokesman pointed out.

>Dmytro Lyubinets added that the 14-year-old was imprisoned by the Russians in the torture cell for the sole reason of having taken pictures of broken Russian equipment.

of Ukrainian invasion

Till Putin comes along just to nuke it

So the annual problem for our population  

Is finding a good way to defend it 

Like maybe

Destroying a rocket or fighting a soldier

Or taking back the western front

Discovering new war crimes that should exist

or bracing for a fire shower



Surviving missile strikes, creating bomb shelters

or failing to locate Putin's safe

Finding a Russian tank, defending the armament

or hitting Poland by mistake


As you can see there a whole lot of stuff that's failed

For Putin thus far

So stick with us cause he just might end up

Remember it took two revolutions and the distraction of a civil war t o get the Russians out of ww1, 

For the Germans, ww1 may have ended with a political coup and civil unrest, but it set up a stab in the back myth that was one of the key factors leading to Hitler and wwii

Comparing Patriots Vs NASAMS:

Patriot systems can cover a lot more area with a 100 mile range they can cover about 4x more area than a NASAM. 

NASAMs apparently have near a 100% intercept success rate so patriots should also have near perfect success. 

Patriot missiles are larger and more expensive at 3 million each Vs 1 million. Presumably that will make them harder to supply but the US likely also has more of them in stock. 

A NASAMS launcher holds 6 missiles and a patriot holds 4. A Patriot system can have 8 launchers and a NASAMS can have 7 I believe. So one system can handle ~30 missiles Vs ~40 if it’s got it’s max launchers. 

So yea Patriots are great but they’re expensive. NASAMS are also great. Ultimately more is better.

A Patriot system itself is several times more expensive.

They have three main thrusts: on Bakhmut itself mostly along the road from Pokrovske; north of the city on Soledar / Bakhmutske from Volodymirivka and Pokrovske; and south of the city from Andriivka. They pulled almost all of the artillery from the rest of the front to this direction. They shell a wide area around Ukrainian positions, then send in a wave of convicts that exposes Ukrainian defenses, then they shell them again, send another wave of convicts, shell again, then may whip out a tank to lob a few direct fire shells. If the Ukrainian lines look silent they send in a wave of more experienced infantry into the new no man's land to dig in overnight.

Both Russians and Ukrainians take losses, but Russian losses are orders of magnitude heavier. They will lose multiple companies to dislodge a single Ukrainian platoon. 

After the front line has not moved in months Russians shifted forces to the Southern and Northern direction a couple of weeks ago and made something that can only be called progress relative to Bakhmut itself. They moved a few hundred meters and took some hamlets and some fields. 

At the same time Ukrainians kept complaining about their own artillery support being insufficient. 

Around the time the southern and northern pincers from Russia began making progress, Ukrainians seem to have pulled more artillery into the area. Russian forward progress stopped. However they then switched back to the city itself over the weekend and made marginal progress.

All of their progress in the city appears to have been erased yesterday. Ukrainians posted multiple videos of successful counter-attacks. 

Vehicles from both sides remain mired in the mud. Once winter sets in, it'll be allied with Ukraine. Ukraine is far better prepared for the winter.

>On 16 September 1989, Yeltsin toured a medium-sized grocery store (Randalls) in Texas.[97] Leon Aron, quoting a Yeltsin associate, wrote in his 2000 biography, Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life (St. Martin's Press): ""For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless, his head in his hands. 'What have they done to our poor people?' he said after a long silence."" He added, ""On his return to Moscow, Yeltsin would confess the pain he had felt after the Houston excursion: the 'pain for all of us, for our country so rich, so talented and so exhausted by incessant experiments'."" He wrote that Mr. Yeltsin added, ""I think we have committed a crime against our people by making their standard of living so incomparably lower than that of the Americans.""

Given the presence of HARMs in the Ukrianian inventory, I doubt Russia has much in the way of SAMs near the front lines anymore. The other effect of the Patriots will be putting much of Western out of range of Russian air launched cruise missles. An Iskander missile only has 400-500KM range versus the Patriot's 300 KM range.

I have 0 accurate way to estimate how much, and freely admit that.

Having had this insight, ""there is something wrong with that"", are you in favor of completely removing people's option for resorting to violence?  Calls for peace are admirable.  

Pragmatic reality.  Lets talk about what violence is going to occur.  The police are going to get complaints if they respectfully ask a rapist to stop raping and then stand by while he ignores them.  Maybe, sometimes, when a greater violence is occuring it is worth considering that a lesser violence has to occur.  We can still strive for a nonviolent world.  Until then we have to deal with asking which violent actions are more or less acceptable.  

>You see nothing wrong purposefully trying to freeze millions of civilians over winter??

The likelihood of people freezing *to death* is exceptionally low.  Knocking out the power causes discomfort.  It disrupts life.  It disables business as usual.  There is no reason to expect that Russia cannot provide survival shelters for those at risk.  

If a large group of people huddle in a concrete slab jail cell they will create enough body heat to stay alive till spring.  Right now the Russians who are in prison for protesting are the only Russians who are earning our sympathy and respect.  I feel for them.

That's called remote training, and in the context of this discussion it's more-or-less the same as watching a video. 

I'm going to say this so no one can misunderstand me:

*There. Is. No. Substitute. For. Actually. Doing. It.*

Whether the training is remote with an instructor or by watching a recording of an instructor (in my experience, those tend to have the same result), it takes a lot of time for students to really learn the stuff that can't be taught with a slideshow and a lectern. That stuff often can only be learned through experience. 

Here's an example: When I was in the military, I had the occasion to fire my M-16 on the burst setting. What wasn't covered in my firearm training was something so small that it was overlooked by everyone who had instructed me: in order to successfully fire the M-16 on burst, you *have* to pull the trigger for all three rounds. If you put the trigger and release after two rounds, your next pull will only fire one bullet.

The US military is fairly good at teaching technical knowledge for respective MOS's, but it can't cover everything. If it did, there would never be a need for NCOs and Staff NCOs.

There's also no substitute for having muscle memory. Training again and again and again not only builds confidence in a particular skill, but it makes you faster at it, too. This is why the US military trains hard on the basics. US Army Patriot batteries spend a lot of time practicing relocating to another position. They're masters at tearing down and moving their systems to another location where they can quickly set it up.

It doesn't matter whether the training was with a ""live"" instructor or just a video of one. You still need time to get that actual, physical practice in.",False,1671020254.0,t3_zlgvvx,t1_j06bdrz,,5,-4,0,-4,0,0,

The basic need to survive war with Russia since 2014 burned some of those problems away and the active war this year has increased the rate of that evolution out of necessity.  

Still, I was under the impression that the old corrupt bullshit is why the Russians were able to take Kherson when they never should have been able to cross the Dnieper River.  “Stupidity and betrayal, or, perhaps, both,” the former governor of the Kherson Oblast, Andrei Gordeev said, which is always the case with every single Russian/Soviet military in the last 200 or more years.

The thing about Soviet/Russian military history is that they do better when defending their homes.

9e00ec65f65e77694758874bda3e238c,zlgvvx,j09pejf,"So we already basically do that to an extent in the US patriot units. You have an MOS for operation and basic maintenance of all of the “big 4” (radar, engagement control station, antenna mast group, and Electronic power plant). A separate MOS handles maintenance, operation, and reloading of the launching stations. There’s another MOS specifically for higher level maintenance of technical systems for the radar and engagement control stations. Each patriot battery is going to have to have a number of crews for each of these (we operated with 3), each crew consisting of 8-12 people depending on if they have a communication and early warning support element. You can run a patriot battalion 24/7 assuming you have enough fire units to cover maintenance cycles, which usually run a couple of weeks to a month. Basically 4 fire units with 2 active at any one time and a battalion level fire direction crew that runs continuously as they don’t need as much maintenance due to lacking a radar and launchers. The concern here primarily is going to be tactical proficiency of the “van crews” and the maintenance plan that goes along with running this equipment for long periods of time. Van crews go through a significant amount of training and certifications prior to being forward deployed although I can’t imagine they’ll make these dudes pass written exams like we had to. 

Perfect world scenario they’d get two battalions worth of equipment, with one battalion operating at a site for a month and then moving to the rear for maintenance in Poland or other neighboring country where Raytheon personnel could work on the system and provide follow on training. Rotate sites, and stay unpredictable and you could nearly skim over March order and emplacement as that’s a large portion of certification and is usually drilled for a significant amount of time. 

Sorry for the rambling I’m thinking this out as I go and for some reason I hadn’t thought about concurrent training of tactical and technical personnel. It wouldn’t *necessarily* have to operate like a US unit would given the threats in theater and if you had a safe rear area for maintenance and sufficient equipment and personnel the tactical training would really be all the needed to be focused on",False,1671069408.0,t3_zlgvvx,t1_j09ntph,,9,1,0,1,0,0,

BTGs are obviously compatible with using smaller detachment forces for assaults. But Russia has been making a concerted effort to not use BTG-organized forces. This is a challenge for them because most of the common structure operates above the company level. Ukraine has been using sub-company-sized forces the entire war.

It sounds basically minorly sketchy, but technically doable, which gives me ""only in wartime"" vibes.

The idea of rotating one of two batteries in and out on the monthly maintenance schedule sounds super helpful too, since it would ease so much of the pressure of the much more time consuming training.
