🪖 While no major territory changed hands over the weekend the war has subtly shifted in [Ukraine’s favor](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1550914005186781184) as russia, unable to start any new offensives, is dealing with a serious [ammunition shortage](https://twitter.com/georgewbarros/status/1550986253176344576) and a [substantial threat](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551095330674016256.html) to Kherson. [ISW](https://twitter.com/TheStudyofWar/status/1551364703561162752), and [DefMon](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551139400142176256.html) covered Sunday's battles. [@Andrew](https://twitter.com/AndrewPerpetua) took the weekend off.

🚧 Ukraine struck another bridge in the Kherson Oblast, this one at [Dar’ivka](https://twitter.com/JimmySecUK/status/1550764462130561026) a smaller bridge leading from Kherson to the Dam at Nova Kakhovka.  The [precision of the strikes](https://twitter.com/bhginee/status/1550829704869027841) was, well, really [just showing off](https://twitter.com/Kartinamaslom5/status/1550784588426911744).   Although russia is attempting to build some [pontoon bridges](https://twitter.com/DefMon3/status/1550888734802984960) and [repair the damaged bridges](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1551113884676886528), given the precision of Ukrainian weapons, it’s doubtful pontoon bridges will be much help in the coming battle.  The russians are now [all too aware](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550733910400811009.html) that their troops in Kherson risk losing their escape routes.

👉 It looks like the russian forces in Vysokopolye are not yet encircled or [snared in a cauldron](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550953911778934789), however it does appear russia may have [quite a bit of trouble](https://twitter.com/defmon3/status/1550808094938222597) re-supplying their troops there.  Information on the situation remains sparse and the fog of war, dense.

🌾 It took less than twelve hours for russia to break the agreement it signed on Friday as it launched four caliber cruise misses at the port of Odessa.  While [two were intercepted](https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1550768526557855745), two missiles [struck the port facility](https://twitter.com/Reevellp/status/1550817931059232769) and caused [some damage](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer/status/1550821209352409090). The Adzhigol Lighthouse was also reportedly [targeted and damaged](https://twitter.com/JayinKyiv/status/1550758343119101954).  russia [initially denied](https://twitter.com/DeusExMachinaNP/status/1550933402857209856) they were responsible then claimed they were [targeting Ukrainian missile complexes](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550955758942126082.html) at the port.  The [UN](https://twitter.com/chitowntoktown/status/1550814329955651589) and the [US strongly condemned](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1550945908136763392) the attacks.  By breaking such a high profile and brokered agreement, russia has **greatly** undermined its allies in Europe who are arguing for a negotiated cease-fire.  Ukraine has indicated it will [continue to try](https://twitter.com/phildstewart/status/1551058029373702144) to export grain despite the agreement being called into question.

🍄 There was a [massive explosion](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1550909530288054277) in occupied Horlivka on Saturday.  And [another](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1550866719463424003) in Gorlovka in the Donbas.  Also hit were [railway lines](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1551099053940809729) and [military basess](https://twitter.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1551154575264174085).

🍄 An incendiary munition exploded over russian controlled Donetsk Sunday morning, [although beautiful](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550935708432568321.html), the thermite strands [burns at 3,500 degrees](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1521991581615677441.html).  Ukraine doesn’t  use such munitions so [the theories](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1551181711706316801.html) are a russian warhead prematurely detonated [or malfunctioned](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1550942361601064961) over the city.   If it was a russian missile malfunction, it would not be [the first](https://twitter.com/TheDeadDistrict/status/1549755252001357824). 

🛩 Ukraine’s air force [is still alive and kicking](https://twitter.com/tinso_ww/status/1551013077801631744) as russia’s air defenses in the south are being attritted.  On Sunday a russian [S-300 air defense system](https://twitter.com/ng_ukraine/status/1551229803273101313) was destroyed. Ukraine's air force also destroyed [three russian strongholds](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1551323666457235457), one [SU-25](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1551249700229193728), and [4 russian Caliber](https://twitter.com/Ukrinform_News/status/1551271898582945792) cruise missles.

👉 In addition to the logistics losses of russian ammo dumps, because of the staggering number of artillery shells used by russia in June, russia is now [dealing with wear](https://twitter.com/MarkHertling/status/1551303935654232066) on their barrels causing [catastrophic failures](https://twitter.com/UAWeapons/status/1551294834027249664) that further limit their ability to carry out actions in the theater.

💰The China-russian [joint venture to build a passenger jet is failing](https://twitter.com/Stas70699731/status/1550930275693125634) over disagreements on profit sharing and the use of western technology.

💰Because of the war and the state of the Ukrainian economy, ratings analyst Fitch Ratings [downgrades Ukrainian debt](https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1550714944458563585) to ‘high risk of default’ from C to CCC, forecasting Ukraine’s economy will shrink 33% in 2022.  This action will make it harder for Ukraine to borrow money and increase the cost of doing so.

🎁 Outgoing UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson put up [a video](https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1550774036136878082) of Ukrainian troops being trained in the UK.  Surprisingly, the royal navy is also training [Ukrainian sailors](https://twitter.com/UKDefJournal/status/1550443097569599491) to undertake mine-sweeping duties as the UK is donating two decommissioned [mine-sweeping vessels](https://twitter.com/SirBrit_/status/1550440279064412162) to Ukraine.

🎁 President Biden has [$6 billion dollars](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1550572376475197442) left in presidential drawdown authority to spend before the end of the fiscal year in September.  This authority is different than the $20 billion in military aid congress approved earlier in the year.  The US also posted [a list](https://twitter.com/Militarylandnet/status/1551292591077036033) of all the military aid it has provided to Ukraine since the war began, a total value of around 7.6 billion dollars.

🇩🇪 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz [delays the delivery](https://twitter.com/TpyxaNews/status/1550916396032352257) of 11 IRIS-T air defense systems.  Kyiv wanted to purchase directly from the manufacturer, but the German government is delaying the approval process.   In other news, Poland is accusing Germany of [failing to honor its promise](https://twitter.com/EuromaidanPress/status/1550827538292817921) to replace tanks Poland donated to Ukraine with modern analogs.

🔥 The EU is making successful strides weening itself off russian oil and Saudi Arabia and Iraq are rushing in to make up the difference, [increasing exports by 90%](https://twitter.com/muusekiimiko/status/1551022058863214594).  Japan is also successfully ridding itself of russian [oil and coal](https://twitter.com/carloseats/status/1550636200574287873).

📰 As if these daily summaries weren’t massive enough, the New York Times [has opened an office](https://twitter.com/Flash43191300/status/1550760587633852419) in Ukraine to cover the war although there is some question on [how neutral](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1550922995618566145.html) the reporting will be.

✊🌻 Ukraine is still favored to recover its pre-invasion 2022 borders by western government reports and trusted third party analysts.  Ukraine has stated its goal is the full liberation of all occupied territory including the Donbas and Crimea regions back to the 2014 pre-invasion borders.

Day 151/152 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday was again pretty quiet, there was no shelling and the missile strike was yet again not aimed at Kharkiv. Today’s missile strike was at 3am, and it was aimed at Chuhuiv, they are destroying that town with everything they can. S-300 missiles were used in this strike; there are photos of an intact S-300 booster lying in the street in Chuhuiv, pretty sure they didn’t fire any Iskanders this time. They chose their favorite targets as usual – a school, and a house of culture. 

This was, most likely, the biggest missile strike in Kharkiv/oblast so far in this war. They launched at least ten S-300 missiles at the same time. But it was probably 12 missiles, which would match three S-300 launchers firing their full load of 4 missiles each. There were civilians in both of the places they destroyed. The total number of casualties is unknown, but at least 3 people were rescued from under the rubble so far.

They are destroying our cities with missiles, killing our people, and then Lavrov says that they are saving the people of Ukraine from an “anti-people and anti-history Kyiv regime.” So killing us is their way of saving us? What the fuck do they mean by anti-history? Is this their usual “Ukraine doesn’t exist, and Ukrainians are just brainwashed Russians” bullshit?  When will they understand that nobody believes in their version of history?

And what do they mean by anti-people? At the start of the war our government was giving away weapons to regular people in the streets with no strings attached, you didn’t even have to show your passport, it was basically “here’s your weapon, you know what to do.” We could have easily used those weapons to go topple the government if we wanted to, but for some reason we decided to use it against the invaders, who would have thought? Certainly not Russia.

Even if our government was anti-people, why would Russia care? We were the ones who voted for it, and we are the ones who need to deal with them if they do something wrong, not some other country. We already dealt with Yanukovich, which Russia didn’t like, saying it was illegal, even though our legal government, which didn’t run unlike Yanukovich, impeached him and started new elections. But now they are saying that Zelenskyy need to be toppled, and that would somehow be not illegal, so *Russia is the law*?",False,1658765110.0,t3_w7etx2,t3_w7etx2,,0,206,0,206,1,0,{'gid_1': 1}

“Our latest report shows how the Kremlin is not only weaponising children to build and maintain support for its invasion; it is indoctrinating future generations in Russia and occupied areas. The Russian government is demonstrating a flagrant disregard for international standards on the rights of children. It seems there are no lengths to which Putin and his cronies will not go in order to manipulate the information environment. That includes using children.
  
The report analyses how Russia is using underage Russians and Ukrainians to deflect responsibility for the invasion, romanticise the war by glorifying Russian soldiers, and indoctrinate children in occupied areas.

This...is very enlightening.

I knew about the other aspects, but what had confused me was how certain people acted. It has shed a kind of logic onto past events which I had trouble making sense of. Why certain politicians, e.g. Medvedev and Kadyrov especially, seem to go off the deep end and make embarrassments of themselves.

But I was thinking in a faulty way. I thought of their words/actions in terms of propaganda and/or some kind of face-saving bluster or even as a way of getting in good with Putin.

It didn't occur to me that their words/actions could be interpreted as a political tool that *undermines* Putin, but it makes sense. These people probably aren't stupid and realized Putin/Russia miscalculated greatly. It makes sense that they'd begin preparing for a scenario where Russia might lose and chaos ensues.

Kadyrov's actions makes much more sense in this regard. I'm still unsure how Medvedev's and Lavrov's statements fit into the grand scheme, but at least I can see it from this different perspective.",False,1658731018.0,t3_w7etx2,t1_ihjbz81,,1,25,0,25,0,0,

From my point of view, Russia doesn't have anything to lose in this deal. If they break the deal themselves, the deal is off and Ukraine can't ship grain.

The worst case scenario on the other hand, would be far more grim: if Ukraine manages to push back the Russians, even as far back as Crimea or the Russian borders, Putin might actually be insane enough to declare the counter-offensive an act of war against Russian home turf and put his nukes to use, because it's obvious he won't be able to push back the Ukrainians any more and having Russia lose even more land than they had before the war would be a catastrophic result which could end Putin's reign back home, given the last remaining soldiers return and will tell everyone about the failures in Ukraine.

We are likely to see a very very desperate Kremlin in the near future, as it becomes obvious they are losing badly and are being destroyed in Ukraine.  What does this mean, **does it mean full mobilization**?  I doubt it, that would cause a lot of problems at home and probably still would not be enough to turn the tide of the war (lack of gear, etc).  

**Do they use tactile nukes**?  Highly unlikely, their last trading partners like China and India would turn on them and the west would quadruple the weaponry provided to Ukraine or maybe even strike Moscow with conventional weapons themselves (scary thought, here comes WW3).  

There doesn't appear to be a way for Putin to turn this war around but he also does not appear capable of quitting when he is losing so... I'm not sure what happens, the west might try to talk Ukraine into ceding Crimea just as a way to end the war after it's obvious the entire Russian military is destroyed and they will not be a threat to anyone, or Ukraine might take Crimea too, over the next 2-10 years they will likely have the military strength to do so as the Russian military fades into oblivion.

The official report for 2021 says that in international exercises the Bundeswehr with its existing equipment is regularly seen as the weakest link in the chain – getting no radios for training or having to wait for protective gear in crisis regions is common.

If the dam is full, they are not going to have very long at all. Usually ""full"" keeps some reserve volume to absorb a brief period of heavy rains to prevent downstream flooding. Typically dams only remain full during light rain seaons. This would give them just enough time to slog their way across the muddy river bottom before having to flow again. They would essentially close their own backdoor once getting across and trap themselves.

If the dam is only partially full they would be able to buy themselves much more time, depending on how full it is. But the same problem exists. Its going to have to flow eventually and the way things are going it is probably still a bad idea for Russia to risk it as any river crossings they can construct while the river is done flowing would easily be taken out by ukraine.

It's first problem started in the north near Kyiv once it moved out past 50 miles of it's staging bases and had to truck in shit, but due to misusing what precision munitions it had, and failing hard in the air war, Russia couldn't protect it's convoys which cut off it's forces from their needed supplies. Then Russia retreated, and swung around to the Donbass region where it again started from initial staging bases, and also had rail lines that it kept it's artillery train next to, this allowed them to have ammo piles right next to the artillery and lay down withering fire. But they again moved out away from their staging grounds, and then HIMARS came into play taking out the ammo dumps and the artillery piles, again forcing them to pull back and truck in supplies from deep into Russia.

When Germany announced that they want to deliver these weapons it was always clear that this wont happen in a matter of some weeks. End of the year is a more realistic date for a best case scenario.
And that the government will refuse to approve the export is highly unlikely after Scholz himself announced the delivery allready in front of the whole parliament.

Regarding the tanks for Poland. It seems that Poland had completely unrealistic expectations. They wanted hundreds of Leopard 2A7V. A version of which only a few dozen exist. Not even the German army has upgraded most of their (very few) tanks to that version. There is just nothing there to give to anyone in short term. 

Instead Germany offered stocked 2A4 (which are older models but still way better than T-72s), that would be upgraded to 2A7V in the same pace as the tanks of the Bundeswehr. 

That doesn't seem to have been good enough for Polands government and since then they have been acting as if Germany broke a promise and practically insulted them personally by not magically conjuring up hundreds of the latest Leopard 2 models out of thin air and gifting them to Poland.

I know, many on reddit love to read stories about how Germany is deliberately delaying help for Ukraine. But I strongly advise to not just believe such stories without checking the facts and reasons.

For the first one that shall be delivered in octobre/november (a date both sides know since day 1) the german government already had to convince Egypt to wait for their delivery. Here Scholz likely declared ""national demand"" to circumvent the original deal (citing demand of Germany and gifting the system to Ukraine) which isn't possible with the current concept.

With this Ukraine shall get money from the german government to buy needed stuff from the german weapon manufacturers – and it decided to try to buy ten more Iris-T SLM with it because it is likely a convincing system. This should be the application that is on the desk of Scholz – which he hasn't signed since three weeks which is the only real information the original article has. The problem here is that Iris-T SLM has to be produced first and there are already other customers waiting for it with no exit clause in sight. So the Iris-T SLM deal isn't something Scholz can simply sign and everything is good. This will likely cause no delays in the delivery even if he waits two months more because in reality it will take years to provide the Ukraine with ten such systems even with major efforts.",1658737713.0,1658733242.0,t3_w7etx2,t1_ihjf8s6,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

>U.S. administration and military officials have said that one of their top concerns is not provoking Russia into a direct conflict with NATO, even as Ukraine points out that Russia invaded their country without provocation.

We have seen multiple statements to that effect over the last six months, and multiple different kinds of aid prevented or delayed, including things like the mooted MIG transfer where training is plainly.not the issue.

Frankly that is moronic. It was moronic in February and it is moronic now. 

It's good that Biden is helping Ukraine, but this war is dragging on and thousands of Ukrainians are unnecessarily dying because of this timid approach that persists in imagining that Russia, which is struggling to overcome a single, economically impoverished country somehow might decide to commit suicide by NATO if the aid is too 'provocative.' 

Like to be really fucking clear the reason Russia isn't and never will be 'provoked' by American military aid is the same reason your average elementary school bully is unlikely to ever get 'provoked' by their 300lb super heavyweight MMA champion neighbour asking them to keep the ruckus down. Every russian general or politician knows what the US defence budget is year in year out, they know the terrifying level of investment in the american military industrial complex and they know that unlike russia american troops actually get 'training' rather than 'pimped out by their commanders to sex tourists'.

 They won't start anything because they know perfectly well that any conventional conflict will end in them receiving a Tony Soprano style curb stomping, most likely from whichever unit of the Idaho national guard happens to be on active duty that weekend.

If you doubt that, from day 1 of this invasion american supplied weapons have been incinerating russian soldiers in horrible ways. Thousands of russian teenagers have had their remains pre-cremated and express delivered home via exploding turrets thanks to American supplied weapons. If russia was going to be 'provoked' by weapons supplies they already would be.The idea that russia is somehow okay with a Javelin but will freak out at artillery and then was  okay with artillery but would freak out at rocket artillery or armor or fighter jets and is now okay with long range rocket artillery and soviet apcs but not American Bradleys or extra long range rocket artillery or fighter jets....its fucking delusional. It's literally just a bunch of arbitrary distinctions that only exist in the minds of the people in the current administration. Russia's blanket position has been since the start of this conflict that all military aid is bad and any increase in military aid will risk world war 3, not because they mean that but because they would like the west not to provide military aid of any kind.

To avoid a further needless waste of ukrainian lives- and of american taxpayer money- the US political and military administration need to rid themselves of the fools who are still pumping the brake on aid, dripping a little bit here and a little bit there and waiting for Ukraine to be in really dire straits and deluding themselves that cowardice equals statesmanship. The US needs to think big, get rid of any limitations on conventional aid and take advantage of the millions of Ukrainian volunteers available to train- the aim should be not to keep them in the fight but to give them such a clear advantage that they defeat the russian invasion, and win the war. 

The longer the West takes to do that, the more this war will drag on and the more it will cost. Either go big or go home. No more half measures.",1658742921.0,1658738720.0,t3_w7etx2,t1_ihjwyln,,2,19,0,19,0,0,

The current war Russia is driving in Ukraine is much worse for Russia than any war the US has ever participated in has been for the US. 

Vietnam, arguably the worst war for the US, saw the US lose 58k troops. In eight years. Russia is on pace to top that in less than one year. In terms of equipment, the US lost far far far less than Russia already has. Then add in that China sent in 320,000 combat troops to directly fight the US and South Vietnam. The Soviet Union provided over 3000 ""combat experts"" for training in addition to arms, munitions, and other equipment. The end of the war was much more of a domestic public opinion pulling support than it was an operational loss. 

Afghanistan is a laughable comparison. The US controlled the entire country easily with less than 2000 combat deaths. The only failure in that theater was setting up a fully functional self-government and military.

In the case of Russia, they are actively fighting a large, high morale military, with an abundance of good equipment, support from a wide variety of Intel sources, and have already lost most of their operational combat ability.

We have no one to blame for this other than ourselves. The situation would be slightly better if we actually spent the 2% of GDP as required by NATO. We can't really claim to be a reliable NATO partner right now, or a very useful ally for Ukraine, even though the situation was only partly caused by current decisions.

Our army isn't in this terrible state because god gave us a shitty army, or because the US or France or Italy or the UK prevent us from having a better army. These are simply political decisions. Now we are catching blame for them. Same for the gas issue. Tough luck. We should recognize that we fucked up (and just to make it very clear, we're far from the only country that fucked up in various different ways when it comes to e.g. Russian energy dependency) and try to do better.

What caught my eye was the exhaust valve failure rate of the supercharged engines (ref pgs 112 and 113) - and while the exhaust temperates of the non-supercharged and supercharged engines were nearly identical - they were able to establish that the temperature at the cylinders was actually much higher (using Silchrome 1)... And then attributed it to the increased pressure - which makes total sense (PV=nRT ... Man, there's an equation I haven't written in a couple of decades, lol!)

... So then they substituted the N-155 alloy with an alloy that was being used in gas turbines at the time (Nimonic 90) which resulted in a lower failure rate than the non-turbocharged engines using the N-155 (well, *zero* failure rate, according to figure 34).  ...I think it's funny how they mention that the Nimonic 90 is probably overkill (and expensive) and discuss that a search for a less expensive material that would, ""still provide an adequate life,"" was underway.

For Russia, that would be the best case once they'd have no more realistic chances to win any more territory without otherwise being ""forced"" to use their only remaining ace: nukes.

2. It doesn't only imply it, it's literally how countries that have nuclear warfare as an option operate against others who do not have it. Russia is already grabbing the world by the throat with their threats, because it's hard to estimate which ones are real or not. Incase you missed it: the reason NATO isn't getting involved beyond weapon/material deliveries is exactly because of that: nuclear threat. My guess why Putin doesn't care about it so far? Probably because he knows the nukes are and always will be an option for him, defense or offense. 

Even so, as you could see and still see in the news: NATO is already tip-toeing around the minefield because they are afraid of Putin considering anything above a certain level a direct involvement in the war. 

If you seriously believe Putin's army will run back to Russia with their tails between their legs or worse: allow Ukraine to re-take the conquered areas, you are very optimistic, if not naive.

As of July 1st, they were the third biggest individual donor to Ukraine in $, and the biggest in the EU. They're investing 100B in addition to their regular budget to get their forces back in shape. They've donated a number of the best SPG in the world, and they've enabled donations by backfilling other EU countries. They're sending Gepards, MARS 2 MLRS, M113s, APCs. 100k grenades, shoulder launched ATs and MANPADS, logistics tanks. They used special powers to stop delivery of the very first charge of IRIS-T AA systems to Egypt which Egypt had ordered years ago, and which is now going to UA. They have sent billions in direct money, and a ton of humanitarian aid. The reason they're not donating as much heavy weaponry is that they're not a Soviet country with thousands of T-72 stored, they pivoted to a smaller but high tech force integrating into NATO. Building new equipment takes a lot of time, and there's a lot of orders for KMW and Rheinmetall's goodies already promised to different countries.

They're doing what they can without compromising their NATO missions. Yes, the Bundeswehr has been kept small, perhaps too small. Yes, they need to massively overhaul their spending, because despite one of the biggest budgets in Europe, they seriously lack the numbers in equipment. Yes, the conservative govt of the past 16 years completey failed to get Germany away from Russian gas. No, they're not putting their heads in the sand. No, they're not folding under Russian pressure w.r.t. gas, even though it will have a huge impact on them this winter.

Since there are 40M households in Germany, the number of electric heaters needed is definitely not less than 100M. The entire country of Germany has installed electric capacity of 218,000 Megawatts total today. That's 70% more power generation, 70% more wires on poles, 70% more substations, 70% more transformers. All of that stuff would have to be manufactured and installed, land acquired, new main transmission lines run. A grid capacity increase of nearly 70% would probably take a decade to fully roll out assuming zero bureaucratic slowdowns or funding issues. The real answer is a switch to heat pump systems in climates that can handle it and gas supply from elsewhere in others, but that's a lot of LNG pipelines to build and furnaces to replace.

Most electric grids run somewhere in the neighborhood of 90%+ of needed capacity with some of that being virtual load shedding.

Germany can either go cold turkey, meaning a lof of their chemical and other industry goes bankrupt. Germany goes into deep recession (very bad news for EU as well) and double digit unemployment, and thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands or millions, die in their unheated homes next winter. The current govt will be voted out, and a pro-Russian one will be voted in that'll lift sanctions and stop UA support. This will impact RU's budget, but not their war effort, since all the equipment RU is using is already built and paying soldiers is a drop in the bucket. They can't build current era tech due to sanctions, with or without money.

Or Germany keeps the pipeline running until the stores are as full as possible and *then* disconnects, making themselves immune to RU blackmail, saving their people, industry and economy and thus keeping public support for more Ukrainian aid high.

The actual 'property rights' on the Marder are somewhat unclear and foggy to the general public, but this article implies that they're property of Rheinmetall (source: [https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Ukraine-moechte-100-Marder-der-Bundeswehr-article23249758.html](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Ukraine-moechte-100-Marder-der-Bundeswehr-article23249758.html)).

But I stand somewhat corrected on the 'delayed by German government' part. Since Rheinmetall has, according to your source, tried to get an export license for Marders and Leos. While this can be understood as 'delayed', please keep in mind that German export restrictions and licenses tend to take quite a while to be answered in peace times. Before the russian invasion, German government often times did not allow any arms deliveries at all into conflict regions, and it's remarkable how quickly they've pivoted away from this stance after Feb 24.",False,1658755234.0,t3_w7etx2,t1_ihkmqz0,,4,7,0,7,0,0,

HIMARS apparently are now hitting russian supply depots in the East and South, within the range of HIMARS and guided artillery supplied to Ukraine,  so the reliance on close rail supply is now a ""problem"" for russia like the convoy was ""a problem"" (not as bad, but a huge problem given the artillery-based strategy).You can correct this if I am wrong.

Augustus in Rome (and several other roman emperors) were held in very high regard. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus)

Alfred ""the Great"" is regarded pretty highly. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred\_the\_Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_the_Great) he really did a lot to setup England to become a powerful and much more innovative region.

Charlemagne still seems to be looked on pretty highly. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne)

Even people primarily known as conquerors like Ghengis Khan,  Alexander, and Julius did a lot of things to help their nations reform and expand.

Looking at many of these 1000+ year old examples a big focus you really see 2 common things, they were adept at warfare and keeping their countries safe and they put a lot of focus on learning and education for their people.

You also find many leaders who have plans to setup government and add more balances- a common thing you see is its ""after me"" but still I think you'll find a lot of countries went through great periods under a single ruler.

That's been the argument of realpolitik proponents such as Mearsheimer who argue that countries like Russia are too big to ignore and they need their ""backyard"" even if that's at the expense of its neighbors.  And that what we're doing with helping arm Ukraine and promise support (and implicitly pathways to NATO and EU integration) is counterproductive.  Don't think they expected Russia to actually invade and seize land.  Even Kissinger has said that Ukraine shouldn't be forced into a bad settlement and they should have at least their pre-invasion territory back.

I personally think it would be a stretch to think we'd do the same thing to Canada, nor would this hypothetical happen.  The relationship between US and Canada is much different than Russia and Ukraine's.    Russia doesn't understand soft power, while the US has plenty of soft power that it has at its disposal, while definitely having hard power.  Canada and the US treat each other as peers and close friends.  Russia ruled over Ukraine and appropriated Ukraine's heritage for its own, akin to a whatif if the US gained control over England and passed off everything the British ever made was really American.

By September 1941 the German-occupied  territory of the Soviet Ukraine was divided between two new German administrative units, the District of Galicia of the Nazi General Government and the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Ukrainians who chose to resist and fight German occupation forces joined the Red Army or the irregular partisan units. However, the Ukrainian population of western Ukraine, had ""little to no loyalty towards the Soviet Union"", whose Red Army had seized Ukraine during the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939.

MTG and her ilk were voted in as a direct push back to a black man holding the presidency.

It took the masks off the US. And it was always the same ilk of people.

Trump pushed the birther lie for years, I can't believe how racist that was and how the USA just forgot about it....clearly its not a deal breaker for a huge swathe of Americans.

Fox news pushing such insanely racist narratives as 'terrorist fist jab'. That's just again, mask off full on racism.
