They're not America.

Here's a recent list of top 15 GDPs:

United States: $20.89 trillion  
China: $14.72 trillion  
Japan: $5.06 trillion  
Germany: $3.85 trillion  
United Kingdom: $2.67 trillion  
India: $2.66 trillion  
France: $2.63 trillion  
Italy: $1.89 trillion  
Canada: $1.64 trillion  
South Korea: $1.63 trillion  
Russia: $1.48 trillion  
Brazil: $1.44 trillion  
Australia: $1.32 trillion  
Spain: $1.28 trillion  
Indonesia: $1.05 trillion

For perspective: with a population of nearly 150 million people, their total GDP is less than South Korea's which is a very small country and only has 50 million people. They simply don't have the money for the best equipment - after sanctions and after Europe (hopefully) reduces their oil purchases from Russia, we can expect to see Russia's total GDP dip below $1 trillion, putting them lower than Indonesia.

The U.S' total GDP is nearly 20 times higher than Russia's, while only having double the population. That generally means for every $100 an American can make, a Russian makes $10.  The U.S. has money, lots of it. Russia doesn't. With economy alone, the US & Western powers can obliterate Russia any day, without even firing a single rocket.

This is why sanctions are extremely important, and refusing to negotiate or do any form of business with Russian companies is **ever** so important if you live in the west. Do not buy their products, do not sell them products. Even as an individual, you can make small differences to ultimately drive their economy into the ground and force them to change as a matter of survival - they are not self-sufficient (no country truly is).",False,1647162568.0,t3_tcxrfr,t3_tcxrfr,,0,151,0,151,0,0,

“I’ll stick my neck out and make several prognostications:

1. Russia is heading for an outright defeat in Ukraine. Russian planning was incompetent, based on a flawed assumption that Ukrainians were favorable to Russia and that their military would collapse immediately following an invasion. Russian soldiers were evidently carrying dress uniforms for their victory parade in Kyiv rather than extra ammo and rations. Putin at this point has committed the bulk of his entire military to this operation—there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. Russian troops are stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face huge supply problems and constant Ukrainian attacks.

2. The collapse of their position could be sudden and catastrophic, rather than happening slowly through a war of attrition. The army in the field will reach a point where it can neither be supplied nor withdrawn, and morale will vaporize. This is at least true in the north; the Russians are doing better in the south, but those positions would be hard to maintain if the north collapses.

3. There is no diplomatic solution to the war possible prior to this happening. There is no conceivable compromise that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine given the losses they have taken at this point.

4. The United Nations Security Council has proven once again to be useless. The only helpful thing was the General Assembly vote, which helps to identify the world’s bad or prevaricating actors.

5. The Biden administration’s decisions not to declare a no-fly zone or help transfer Polish MiGs were both good ones; they've kept their heads during a very emotional time. It is much better to have the Ukrainians defeat the Russians on their own, depriving Moscow of the excuse that NATO attacked them, as well as avoiding all the obvious escalatory possibilities. The Polish MiGs in particular would not add much to Ukrainian capabilities. Much more important is a continuing supply of Javelins, Stingers, TB2s, medical supplies, comms equipment, and intel sharing. I assume that Ukrainian forces are already being vectored by NATO intelligence operating from outside Ukraine.

6. The cost that Ukraine is paying is enormous, of course. But the greatest damage is being done by rockets and artillery, which neither MiGs nor a no-fly zone can do much about. The only thing that will stop the slaughter is defeat of the Russian army on the ground.

7. Putin will not survive the defeat of his army. He gets support because he is perceived to be a strongman; what does he have to offer once he demonstrates incompetence and is stripped of his coercive power?

8. The invasion has already done huge damage to populists all over the world, who prior to the attack uniformly expressed sympathy for Putin. That includes Matteo Salvini, Jair Bolsonaro, Éric Zemmour, Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orbán, and of course Donald Trump. The politics of the war has exposed their openly authoritarian leanings.

9. The war to this point has been a good lesson for China. Like Russia, China has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade, but they have no combat experience. The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army Air Force, which similarly has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership will not delude itself as to its own capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a future move against Taiwan.

10. Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

11. Turkish drones will become bestsellers.

12. A Russian defeat will make possible a “new birth of freedom,” and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to a bunch of brave Ukrainians.”",False,1647145461.0,t3_tcxrfr,t3_tcxrfr,,0,340,0,340,1,0,

>When you read histories and memoirs of [Stalin’s era], you realize how many people were required to put the terror in motion and maintain it. **When you think about all the snitches, investigators, drivers, interrogators, guards, cooks, doctors, and supervisors needed to carry out the execution and internment of tens of millions of people, you realize that there were probably more collaborators than victims.** These were people who showed up at other people's doors before dawn, ransacked their homes, and led them down to a waiting car, which someone then had to drive to a fully staffed, giant prison complex, where the prisoners were processed, thoroughly searched, and put in filthy, overcrowded cells. And on and on down the line. 

>These were people who took active, violent part in a reign of terror against their countrymen, neighbors, and even relatives. They pulled the triggers and locked the gates. They administered beatings and burned bodies. **They did not do it just because they were following orders, though many, doubtless, did.** Many did it because they believed they were liberating the country from a fifth column. Many more did it because they personally benefited from the regime. The higher-ups got the apartments of the disappeared as well as their belongings; people lower down the rungs got more pay and more food at a time when millions went hungry. And many others believed in the system precisely because they benefited from it. **Even when the system turned on them, they believed that there had been some terrible mistake.

“What we are seeing in Russia is a resurgence of imperialism and nationalism in its most dangerous form,” he said, comparing Russia's annexation of Crimea and Putin's domestic propaganda to Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II.

“Just read what Putin has been saying in his [anti-West] speeches in the past year”.

“It’s 24/7 brainwashing of the Russian people … pure lies”.

With the EU and US imposing economic sanctions on Russia over its war on Ukraine, Kasparov said the West is more powerful than it thinks.

“Russian gas is one third of EU consumption. But Russia sells 80 percent of its oil and gas to Europe … If it all stopped, parts of the EU would freeze, but the Russian economy would fall apart”, he noted.

“The leverage is on the European side”.

Recalling western Europe's appeasement of Hitler when he annexed Austria in 1938, Kasparov said it would also cost less to stop Putin now than at a later stage.

But he added that some in the EU elite “don’t care about Ukraine and want to return to business as usual [with Russia]” for political or financial reasons.

Italy and France have voiced doubt on keeping the sanctions in place.

But Kasparov reserved his censure for Hungarian PM Viktor Orban and Czech president Milos Zeman, the noisiest sanctions critics, whose countries once rose up against Soviet oppression.

“They are committing crimes against the histories of their own nations. It’s an insult to the people who died in 1956 or 1968 from Soviet tanks, just as people in Ukraine are dying today”, Kasparov said.",False,1647170867.0,t3_tcxrfr,t3_tcxrfr,,0,33,0,33,0,0,

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later. As such, while I do my best to corroborate sources as I compile this index of events, I cannot guarantee that any single statement is 100% correct.  If you have suggestions of corrections or additions, please reply or DM me.


**In Ukraine**


👉🆕 Thousands of people has turned out for a protest rally in occupied Kherson, with hundreds of protesters holding up a very long Ukrainian flag

👉🆕 Mykolaiv's Mayor says there are 9 casualties from Russian air strikes today

👉🆕 Mayor of Irpin claims 70% of the town is under firm Ukrainian control with the remainder being mopped up

👉🆕 Ukrainian authorities will attempt new evacuations today from besieged cities and towns

👉🆕 Zaporizhzhia Regional Administration claims that the Mayor of Dniprorudnoye has been detained by Russian soldiers, making it the second Mayor kidnapped so far in the region

👉🆕 Mariupol has seen intense air strikes and artillery fire since the early hours. Fierce fighting continue on the outskirts of the city with reports of 6 Russian tanks being destroyed and 12 Russian soldiers captured

👉🆕 Electricity reportedly out in parts of Mykolaiv but the port city still has water and heating

👉🆕 Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says they will soon roll out a plan for a crop sowing campaign to safeguard food supplies

👉🆕 A local journalist in Kherson is reported as having disappeared. Oleh Baturin filmed protest rallies against the Russian occupation. His wife says he left yesterday afternoon and never returned

👉🆕 Separatist forces claim Volnovakha is in DNR hands but some reports claim fighting still continues for control of the area

👉🆕 Mayor of Skadovsk in Kherson region says the Russian occupiers have completely left the city

👉🆕 Chernihiv was again hit by air strikes, this time another residential high rise was struck with most of the building collapsing. One person was killed and seven wounded. Chernihiv's emergency services were quickly on the scene to put out fires and help wounded

👉🆕 Russian occupiers in Melitopol have reportedly appointed a new spokesperson after the Mayor was ""arrested on charges of terrorism"". The new spokesperson, a local lawmaker, in a video statement told residents to ""adjust to the new reality"" and that protests are ""extremist"". Russian military vehicles are also driving around the city equipped with loudspeakers that say protest rallies are banned, curfew in effect

👉🆕 Izyum still remains largely contested with Russian forces supposedly holding its northern banks but are unable to advance past it. Izyum is a key strategic city in the Kharkiv region as control over it would allow Russian army a chance to strike Ukrainian forces on the Donbas front line from behind

👉🆕 Another Humanitarian aid convoy headed to Mariupol began yesterday evening from Zaporizhzhia and is currently reported to be in Berdyansk where Russian troops have stopped it. President Zelenskyy says in a statement that they hope it will reach the port city today. One attempted aid convoy was reportedly looted by Russian soldiers at multiple checkpoints yesterday

👉🆕 Artillery shelling and air strikes began early today in eastern Ukraine, notably Avdiivka, Lysychansk, Druzhkivka, Slovyansk, Severodonetsk and Kramatorsk. In Slovyansk the local TV tower was hit and in Kramatorsk the airport

👉🆕 The airport in Ivano-Frankivsk that lies in western Ukraine has been struck by cruise missiles for the second day in a row reports the city's Mayor, who also urges residents nearby to relocate. Almost all infrastructure of the airport has now been destroyed

👉🆕 A Russian Su-34 aircraft was shot down by Ukrainian air defenses above Izyum in the Kharkiv region this morning. Two pilots reported to have ejected

👉🆕 In the early hours, at least eight cruise missiles struck the Yavoriv Military Training Ground, also known as The International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, in western Ukraine. The devastation was large, with 35 dead and 134 injured reported so far. This is one of the primary areas for the training and organising of the foreign volunteers coming to Ukraine and was previously the site where foreign military instructors helped train Ukrainian army. Being only 25km from the Polish border, the sound of the attack was heard in Poland with windows supposedly rattling in their frames from the force of the impacts

👉🆕 Late in the evening yesterday an empty evacuation train on the Lviv-Kramatorsk line was hit by artillery fire near Slovyansk in Donetsk region as it was headed to pick up passengers in Lyman. A conductor was killed and another was wounded


**Politics/Diplomacy**


👉🆕 Polish President says Russian use of chemical weapons could force NATO to reconsider its decision not to militarily intervene

👉🆕 NATO Secretary General is worried that Russia may use chemical weapons

👉🆕 Russia's Ministry of Defence claims it has destroyed 3,687 Ukrainian military infrastructure facilities

👉🆕 A fourth round of negotiations will only take place once ""legal formats"" have been worked out says Ukrainian Presidential Office


**Other notable events**


👉🆕 Russian General who was involved in annexation of Crimea says without ""partial mobilization"" (of Russian troops) war in Ukraine could last ""several years"" and that the manpower ratio is in favour of Kyiv with the advantage only increasing

👉🆕 Invasion of Ukraine may have ""enormous impact"" on world food supplies says Financial Times

👉🆕 Russian anti-war protest rallies have been called for today by opposition leader Navalny who says ""Take to the streets. We must stop the war"". Some rallies already beginning in Irkutsk and Yekaterinburg have seen protesters quickly arrested and put into buses

👉🆕 Belarusian hospitals and morgues continue to overflow with Russian wounded. Recent reports claim two thirds of the blood reserve in Belarus is being used for Russian soldiers

👉🆕 Russian forces are supposedly forming new units due to losses with one of the reinforcements being 1 500 soldiers from the 40th Marine Brigade in Kamchatka

👉🆕 Bermuda's Civil Air Authority says it has suspended airworthiness certificates of all Russian aircraft as of Sunday, putting passenger planes at risk of seizures abroad. Supposedly half of all Russian commercial aviation planes are registered in Bermuda

👉🆕 UK Ministry of Defence suggests Russia is meeting ""staunch resistance"" from Ukrainian forces and that the price is high as Russian forces attempt to circumvent Mykolaiv to reach Odessa, encircle Kyiv and cut off Ukrainian forces on the Donbas front lines by striking out from Kharkiv region

👉🆕 Analysts suggest the reason Russian advances in many areas have been limited is in large part due to logistical constraints, as Russian supply truck reach is limited to around 140km (90 miles) before a staging depot would need to be set up, and that this has still not been solved by the Russian forces.

This is an incredible analysis of how Putin's invasion of the world will re-order the global world, largely for the better.  By a leading Chinese policy thinker, in Shanghai, originally written in Chinese. Brief thread, but read the whole thing. (https://uscnpm.org/2022/03/12/hu-wei-russia-ukraine-war-china-choice/)

Hu Wei is the vice-chairman of the Public Policy Research Center of the Counselor’s Office of the State Council, the chairman of Shanghai Public Policy Research Association, the chairman of the Academic Committee of the Chahar Institute, a professor, and a doctoral supervisor.

He writes that Putin's invasion of Ukraine will lead to:
1.	Possibly an escalation of the war beyond Ukraine.  
2.	Certainly Putin’s defeat.  
3.	The United States regaining leadership in the Western world, and the West being more united.  
4.	A new ""Iron Curtain"" falling globally, this time dividing democracies from authoritarian regimes, and extending into Asia.  
5.	Growth in the power of the West, in both military strength and the strength and importance of western institutions. Greater hard power and soft. 
6.	Further isolation of China, as the US, Europe, and also Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Australia turn against China.  

""China will not only be encircled militarily ... but also challenged by Western values and systems.""

He closes by saying that China has 1-2 WEEKS in which to make a choice. And basically says that China should choose the West, and use its influence over Putin to end the war and bring him to heel. It says that China is the only nation that can. I don't disagree.

The whole thing is incredible, and very clearly argued. Read the whole thing here in the English translation. It's not more than a 10 minute read.

The original Chinese text is on the same page (link at the bottom). Remember, this is written by a senior Chinese policy thinker in Shanghai. It's incredible. /fin

Anyone who works in the tech field, or any industry sensitive to nation state level propaganda has been used to it for years now. It's not that hard. In terms of Russian misinfo - just reading ""unSpun"" and ""Foundation of Geopolitics"" is enough to give you a clear picture of what's fake and not and how to find out. 

Russian misinformation takes an asymmetric and dynamic form, that has only become more rapid and diversed in it's messaging; first spiking in the early 90s, with marked increases in the early 2000s and 2015ish - the latter of which began a steady consistent curve on the graph, culminating recently in the unprovoked invasion on sovereign Ukraine. They keep a multifront, dynamic info in - misinfo out system running literally always. There are people who look at web metrics to judge efficacy. There are psychologists, sociologists and their peers to observe the data and form the messaging. There are reps for the heads of their intelligence agencies and internal government to keep the messaging ""on message"" and politically useful.

Problem is, they never solved all the problems. There are simple patterns, and habits that they cannot seem to shake. And that tends to render a system that should be silent but effecient into an out of control bulldozer with the subtlety of an....out of control bulldozer.

This shit isn't hard to see, learn to recognize the patterns and how best to counter it.

Russis only had by estimates around 2000-4000 missiles actually available pre war, and had already fired upwards of 600 by Monday this week, with no hope of replacing spent munitions with imports locked down.  At some point here they have to start seriously considering how many they *need* to keep in reserve for national defense.

They'd been leaning away from major missile strikes for a bit (in favor of more conventional artillery or plane bombardment). Makes me wonder if they're growing more concerned about their aircraft losses or the like.

This is a marked departure from the way in which nuclear bombs have been used previously.  Previously, the guiding principle was ""mutually assured destruction"" - that is, if you use your nuclear weapons against us, we will use them against you, and everyone will die.

Different times call for a different policy.  In the future, I don't think we can heed threats to use nuclear force anymore.  Otherwise, we are looking at a profoundly destabilized world in which any nuclear power can invade and conquer any non-nuclear power so long as they don't have the protections of a military alliance. 

Instead, I think we will need some kind of ""zero tolerance"" policy towards nuclear threats in order to maintain order.  That is, if something similar to the war in Ukraine happens again, we need to present two options to the invading party: (1) we will fully commit whatever conventional forces we've decided to commit notwithstanding your threats, and (2) if you actually follow through on your threats and use nuclear bombs, MAD is guaranteed.

I know developments have been sort of ebbing an flowing…but the attack on west Ukraine is a very big deal in my opinion and should generate quite a bit of conversation. 

Many Ukrainians and journalists fled to Lviv and west Ukraine because it was seen as a safe zone of sorts. People didn’t think that Putin would dare attack west Ukraine purely because of how close they are to the polish border, and of course one misguided error could easily inflict harm on Poland and potentially activate article v as a result.

Putin is doing many questionable actions that it appears he almost testing the limits. Almost as if he’s baiting nato to join. Granted he’s yet to unleash and any chemical attacks or unleash any radioactive nuclear attacks (let’s hope the intel reports are wrong) but this action of attacking west Ukraine is another drop in the bucket of raising more questions on Putin’s long term intentions.

It’s been raised here before and I’ll raise this again. I don’t believe this is necessarily a direct war against Ukraine.

You see, in 1979, this guy named Roger Stone meets this rich asshole named Donald Trump, and they become fast friends. In 1980, this guy Roger Stone founds a lobbying practice with this other asshole named Paul Manafort, called Black Manafort Stone & Kelly. Trump hires Roger stone as one of his first clients, and then Trump hires Manafort to be his lawyer on ""gambling and real estate issues."" Then, in 1984, this Russian Mobster named David Bogatin gets caught laundering money using Trump Tower properties, and the properties are seized by the federal government. Trump had more than 1,300 of these sorts of transactions with Russian mobsters, cash purchases made by shell companies. At least 13 people with links to the Russian mob are known to have been involved in Trump condos. It was money laundering from the Russian government - the kleptocracy in action.

But then, in 1987 - still during the Soviet Union - Trump made his first trip to Moscow, at the behest of the Russian ambassador to the US. This invite came from none other than Ivan Gromakov, who was a KGB General in the Washington directorate. Who is to say what this guy Trump did in the USSR, but when he came back, a couple of weeks later... he filed to run for president. And then he took out full page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Boston Globe titled ""There’s Nothing Wrong With America’s Foreign Defense Policy That a Little Backbone Can’t Cure.”

These ads basically called for NATO to be disassembled. Why does that sound so familiar to me? Anyway, back to the story. So this Trump guy, his presidential campaign didn't really materialize, and before you know it, he was back at ""running businesses"" - except, for some reason, he couldn't run the things worth a damn. His businesses were failing left and right. Airlines, football, even casinos. How do you lose money on a Casino?

So throughout the 80s and 90s he keeps having all these weird connections to Russians who keep getting busted for money laundering. And meanwhile his lawyer buddy Paul Manafort registers as a Foreign Agent of Saudi Arabia but also engages in other unregistered lobbying for generally unfavorable types like Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and lots of other generally horrible people. So anyway, Trump's businesses are failing, reportedly 3.4 billion in debt by 1990. Defaulted on his airline in 1992. Donald Trump again visits Moscow in 1995... to discuss building a Trump tower. Then, according to him... his fortunes change when he holds an IPO that year raising $140 million bucks. But... his businesses keep failing..?

By the 2000s he was radioactive. The wall street banks would not touch him. His casinos had failed. Well, starting in 2002, there was this company called The Bayrock Group, who operated out of Trump tower. The managing director was this guy with lots of ties to Russian oligarchs and Russian intelligence named Felix Sater. The company has tons of ties to the Kremlin. Obvious an intelligence op. Bayrock essentially tells Trump that they want to pay him to use his name to develop real estate. Trump would basically not be involved in the financing or development but would just take up to 25% share of the profits.

All the sudden, the Trump name is going up on buildings all around the world. Even when the real estate crisis happens, Trump starts building golf courses in 2008, and according to his own son, the money to do that came from Russia. Meanwhile, his old friend Paul Manafort sets up shop in 2003, in this little country you might have heard of called Ukraine. He was hired by a Russian Oligarch named Oleg Deripaska, and eventually this led to Paul Manafort working with them to advance Russian interests domestically. He even met with Dick Cheney about it. During this time, Manafort started working on the political campaign of Viktor Yanukovych, for the pro-russia party. He got paid over 12 million bucks off the books donations from Yanukovych, and continued to work for him until the Ukrainians revolted and kicked his ass out of power, ultimately netting over 75 million from working for pro-Putin oligarchs.

Trump though has something of a renaissance and becomes a reality TV star beloved by millions of cretins. Bayrock group builds Trump branded properties everywhere, and in 2013, he travels again to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, funded by Aras Agalarov, an Oligarch. Then, the Maidan revolution, the Crimea war, sanctions. And Donald Trump announces his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election. One of the people being sanctioned is Oleg Deripaska.

For some reason, Trump hires Manafort to be the chairman of his presidential campaign, despite having no national campaign experience. He's only real reputation is as being a lobbyist for murderous regimes. And he is in millions and millions of dollars in debt at the time. But he offers to work as Trump's campaign manager free of charge...

Trump's very first campaign event is about foreign policy, hosted by this guy named Dmitri Simes - A Russian operative - you can check him out on Channel one Russia! Paul Manafort met with a number of Russian operatives like Emin Agalarov and Natalia Vesenitskaya in Trump Tower. And then at the GOP convention that year, Trump made an objection to the GOP's platform plank position regarding Ukraine - objecting that we should provide ""lethal assistance"" and instead recommending ""appropriate assistance.""

Meanwhile, Roger Stone briefly works with the campaign and then shortly after quits on the same day he admits to being in contact with Russian intelligence posing as a hacker called Guccifer 2.0. Then everyone catches on that Paul Manafort is an obvious spy and unregistered foreign agent and he has to duck from the campaign ASAP.

And with the full propaganda machine of the Russian state bearing down, Trump easily won the presidential election, spent four years trying to dismantle NATO and acting like Putin's lap dog, was impeached for withholding military aid for Ukraine on behalf of the Russian government, and still walks free today. Wild story, isn't it!?

I think that's all the ones I used, but I'd be happy to find additional citation for any of them, all but some obvious speculation has been reported on. And yes, as some of you have noted, this is the tip of the iceberg, the campaign had many more strange connections I didn't even detail. I could spend another few hours writing all the strange pro-Russia things that Trump did while president.

EDIT 2: Also, just in case anyone wonders ""What about the Mueller Report"", I suggest you sit down and read it, it's a wonderful retelling of some of what I just told you, but much of it was ""out of scope"" of the investigation - the scope being set by the Trump justice department, as it was ordered by republican Rod Rosenstein (after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the matter due to...his ties to Russia). And Mueller says this in the report - he was only allowed to investigate a very narrow scope of criminal activity, and it was the opinion of the Trump ""Justice"" Department that the president could not commit a crime...

This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power. Hard power contrasts with soft power, which comes from diplomacy, culture and history.

>	According to Joseph Nye, hard power involves ""the ability to use the carrots and sticks of economic and military might to make others follow your will"". Here, ""carrots"" stand for inducements such as the reduction of trade barriers, the offer of an alliance or the promise of military protection. On the other hand, ""sticks"" represent threats - including the use of coercive diplomacy, the threat of military intervention, or the implementation of economic sanctions. Ernest Wilson describes hard power as the capacity to coerce ""another to act in ways in which that entity would not have acted otherwise"".",False,1647155725.0,t3_tcxrfr,t3_tcxrfr,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

Basically, the bargaining strategy is to ALWAYS exaggerate your resolve, say ""maybe"" NOT ""never"". Even if you have no intention to fight at all. (That is why Putin did not believe Ukraine).

Because the strategy is to always exaggerate your resolve--and your opponent expects you to--when NATO says they will NEVER intervene, it sends a strong signal that they have no resolve. This is an invitation for Putin to do as he pleases--it EMBOLDENS him. Beyond just Ukraine.

Had NATO signals been ambiguous (even if their true intention was NOT to defend Ukraine), that would have raised Putin’s expected costs of war-he doesn't want to fight NATO. Even a small risk of NATO involvement would have forced him to tread lightly, and maybe, prevented the war

Another bargaining tool Putin uses brilliantly is brinkmanship, which is taking actions that increase the chance of an accidental war. The goal is to make the adversary lose their nerve and back down. Putin engaged in brinkmanship when he ordered to put his nukes on high alert.

Now that was not a threat against Ukraine—that was a direct threat to the West. (It’s not Ukraine he plans on nuking—a topic for another thread). The counter-move is to escalate further, to raise the stakes, so that the opponent backs down.

By responding, you take control. Ignoring the threat does NOT help preserve peace or de-escalate—it gives all the control to the opponent.

The goal of crisis bargaining is to avoid war. But counter-intuitively, you often have to escalate the threat of war to get your best bargaining outcome WITHOUT going to war. Putin understands crisis bargaining, and that gives him the upper hand.

NATO keeps announcing that they fold, which prompts Putin to keep poking to find out the limits (e.g. his recent threat to target the weapons convoys).

The other cause of war--the commitment problem—has to do with actors lacking the tools to credibly commit to a division of the pie a priori. This will become more relevant here, once the war is over or when there a negotiated settlement is reached.""

I read what politicians are saying and see that many people still can't accept the inevitable. I afraid the West will not be able to pay off with money, expensive gas and oil and Ukrainian lives. Putin is Dzhingiskhan of 21 century, nurtured by the trade with Europe, bribing politicians and recruiting people like former Deutsch chancellor Gerhand Schreder to his side to put the EU countries dependent on Russian resources. He is partially succeded, as for now the EU can't say Putin fuck off.  
  
Putin respects the US, but he has always thought that the EU (sorry for rudeness, just trying to convey the idea) is a bunch of weak and feminine omega males who would swallow everything he does. He was surprised by the EU unity, but the EU should be much stronger as, I'm sure, Putin will continue to provoke NATO.  
  
Speak with Russians a little. Them and Putin have the same mentality reminding mongol horde, it just feels like you are speaking with someone who's common methods are destroy, blow up, rape, burn, kill and more like that. They don't understand anything else that force and power.  
  
That's why I feel ashamed when Macron calls Putin every day or two. It's like negotiating with serial killer - nonsense and every concession you make will stand against you in the future as the only goal of a serial killer is murder. You didn't answer Putin in 2014 and continued to increase the dependance on Russian resources - he came to Ukraine in 2022. You don't answer him now - he will come to the EU territory.

Bernie cried rigged in 2016 and he refused to drop out of the race even after it was clear he had lost which had a clear impact on Hillary’s campaign. Bernie always votes against Russian sanctions and he even used to visit Russia all the time in the 1980s. Bernie’s Chief campaign strategist in 2016 was Tad Devine. The same Tad Devine who helped Paul Manafort and the Russians get Yanukovych elected in Ukraine.

>10. Hopefully Taiwan itself will wake up as to the need to prepare to fight as the Ukrainians have done, and restore conscription. Let’s not be prematurely defeatist.

Just on this there's no doubt this invasion is going to prompt a major audit of the chinese military- china has a way larger, way better funded military than Russia, but this is still going to leave them very anxious that their might be similar hidden systemic weaknesses.

And for Taiwan, the lessons for their defence budget are pretty simple. For the time being, drones and missiles are king, and numerous trained, highly motivated infantry on the defensive are extremely hard to defeat.

They should steer clear of large easily targetted military assets like warships, absolutely flood the island with AA systems both manpad and theatre,  invest heavily in drones, antiship missiles, long range missiles capable of targetting the mainland, and ensure basically every adult citizen is trained to fire a stinger or javelin and operate as defensive infantry.

> Отключение Instagram в России
Здравствуйте
Поскольку руководство социальной сети Instagram вопреки международному праву впервые в истории и только в отношении россиян разрешило призывы к насилию, Генеральная прокуратура приняла решение о запрете этой соцсети в России
Призывы к насилию в отношении людей, объединённых по признаку национальной общности или гражданства, являются частью состава преступления, характеризуемого как «геноцид», что запрещено Конвенцией ООН от 1948 года «О предупреждении преступлений геноцида и наказания за него», разработанной по итогам рассмотрения всей доказательственной базы нацистских преступников, собранной в ходе Нюрнбергского трибунала
Нам необходимо обеспечить психологическое здоровье граждан, в первую очередь детей и подростков, защитить их от травли и оскорблений в сети
Для информирования ваших друзей и подписчиков, переноса фото- и видеоматериалов с вашего аккаунта на другие ресурсы, в том числе в российские социальные сети, Роскомнадзор предусмотрел время на переходный период. Instagram прекратит работу на территории России с 00 часов 14 марта
Поскольку Россия является страной, имеющей свои конкурентоспособные интернет-платформы, в том числе соцсети VK и Одноклассники, с охватами в десятки миллионов пользователей, надеемся, что ваш переход в эти интернет-среды произойдёт быстро, а в перспективе вы откроете для себя новые возможности коммуникации и ведения бизнеса

I'm saying this because people keep saying that Putin can't afford another war. But Ukraine's general population is 44Million and they have the biggest military in the region. Physically the country is 1.9x the size of Poland for example, and has a less dense but generally bigger population.

But Poland wouldn't likely be his next target.

Moldova would be a good Bet, as they are ""neutral"" by their constitution and therefore not a part of NATO. But they are also small and relatively poor. So it would be at a different scale. Finland is also not a NATO country and with a population of around 5 Million they would be (again) much easier than Ukraine.

I don't think Moldova is a smart move because it requires the stabilisation and control of the route through south Ukraine. Which he doesn't have yet. 

Then if we look at ex-soviet bloc countries that are NATO. The Baltics come to mind. It would be easy for Putin to use his previous logic to illegitimise their countries and claim they aren't real countries (and therefore can't be part of NATO because they don't exist, so he isn't scared or NATO).

The Baltics are very small, with low population. There are NATO troops in those countries at the moment though which would put up more or a threat.

Anyway: what I'm saying is, if this were a video game then:

NATO would have been nightmare mode

I am currently of the view that the harm caused by potentially downvoting innocent comments and creating an echo chamber is outweighed by the harm prevented by ensuring that developments are shared quickly. I'd be interested to hear other views. For anyone wondering this is basically the approach taken by John Stuart Mill when considering whether to legislate against something which is perceived to be immoral.

Edit: and yes I get the irony in using this argument against free speech which was basically what mill stood for, but I think the circumstances are different when one side has no intention of airing a genuine debate.

The longer those sanctions last, and the more damage they do economically, the more reason Putin has to come to the table to negotiate.

We also have *more* sanctions we can add to the existing ones, plus Europe is *quickly* taking steps to be independent of Russian oil - when that happens, who is he going to sell it to for a profit? He's already signed into a long-term deal with China for a discounted price, so he's not going to get any help there.

And even if he ""wins"" in Ukraine, he still faces years of bloody rebellion there, while the sanctions go on and on and on.

Plus, he looks weaker and weaker all of the time; the rest of the world is watching his military get chewed to pieces, so his allies are seeing Putin's power turned to dust. Is there any reason for them to ally with him other than his military support? It's really only Iran and Syria, and I really don't think he's going to look that useful to them soon.

He still has his nukes, but what good are those to Iran or Syria? Is he going to nuke someone on their behalf? I think it's doubtful.

The USSR achieved all that, Russia can't.

Much of what made the USSR a technological superpower was its diversity of peoples, a fantastic school level education system, and half decent leadership. Russia was just one of the states making up the USSR and it is simply the biggest, not the one that had maximum quality. Russia is a mere shadow of its former union.

A lot of the most technical and advanced places were not in the Russian SSR but others that are now independent countries. For reference, look how much of a European leader in tech Estonia is, punches massively above its weight. After the fall of the USSR, the tech stayed where it was. Many (now former) Soviet citizens stayed within (or moved to) these places or even left the poorer SSRs, particularly Russia, for the West. The ""brain drain"" in the 1990s was very real, once international travel became possible many of those with an ability to seek better employment abroad did just that. Highly skilled workers, particularly scientists and academics, or those with desirable technical knowledge, were not valued by Russia like they were in the USSR. A rocket scientist in the breadline with a lucrative offer abroad on the table doesn't exactly have a hard choice to make. By the end of the 1990s, the vast majority of young Russians left were the ones without the skills to make it elsewhere.

To make matters worse, the best and brightest leaving weren't being replaced either. Economic collapse, corruption, and poor prioritisation meant that excellent education system wasn't developed or maintained. Leadership, particularly at the local level, became highly corrupt, even more than it was famed for being in Soviet times.

Russia also screwed up manufacturing, it's nowhere near the self sufficient production powerhouse that was the USSR. It can't even produce parts to maintain several Soviet products used widely in industry or by the military.",False,1647158214.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0gv2ix,,1,7,0,7,0,0,

We tried doing this with russia and china. In a way that waging war between the EU and russia or China becomes so expensive that no one wants it. And in the end, let Russia and China transform themselves into democratic systems by showing what freedom looks like.

If an election occurs, the most popular candidate currently (besides Putin) is the current Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. He's well into Putin and oligarch's inner circle. If the government was overthrown because of the Ukraine invasion, his popularity (if it's even real) would likely drop.

Historically, for whatever that's worth, the Russian military avoids being directly involved in regime change. So a General taking over is viewed as unlikely. A ""coup"" would likely be conducted by members of the Communist Party, possibly the younger and more revolutionary members politically to the left who have been pushing back against authoritarianism and corruption. It's the 2nd most popular political party, is popular in cities and industrial areas and is seen as the opposition party. I point out younger members, because the older members (like party leader Zyuganov) are more integrated into and supportive of the Kremlin and gave backed Putin's actions in annexing Crimea and pro-separatists in Donbas.

An [oligarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy) is where a small group of people hold political power within a country. In parlance today it is most closely associated with a small group of *wealthy* people who use their power to influence or control the government of a country. It is in contrast to a democracy where a large group of people have power, and a tyranny where only one person has power.

In Russia the [oligarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarchs) and the security apparatus of the state are the ruling entities. They have structured the Russian economy and the government to enrich themselves, often in ways that would be illegal anywhere else. Hence why people refer to the Russian Oligarchs fairly frequently. The exact history of how they came to be is complex; see the link above.

The US is arguably part oligarchy. It is no secret that industry heavily lobbies lawmakers in the government, and in many cases literally write the statutes that lawmakers put forward.

* Promises to stomp down on corruption hard and a reintroduction of real democracy

* A request for nuclear disarmament to restart and on a much larger scale. Keeping enough to defend but no more.

At its core, an NFZ means that the enforcing party is going to be the only party flying in the sky. This is an important point that most people asking for an NFZ forget about, and follow up with how an NFZ would help the Ukrainian Air Force achieve its objectives. There would be *no* Ukrainian Air Force if an NFZ were to be enforced, as NATO would have to shoot down their planes as well.

Thus, with Russia disagreeing to it, you're correct: NATO would just be joining Ukraine, and thus getting involved in direct conflict with Russia. Calling it an NFZ won't change anything, because Russia hasn't agreed to it (unless they decide they don't want to take the risk and actually ground their planes, which I can't see happening).

As for Article 4, maybe you confused it with Article 5? Article 5 is the 'hot' one, which says that an armed attack against one of the members is an attack to all. In the case of Russia shooting down NATO planes in Ukraine, while it could technically apply, it does not happen in NATO soil, and the invocation is likely to be disregarded.

Purely defensive. It's on him to continue lobbing shit at western Ukraine - or target the batteries within Poland. More likely than not, he'll just stay away from Lviv.

I might can answer this one. Germany has been shutting down all it's polluting energy generating plants and switching to green energy.

And before long Russian aggression was the least of his worries.  Ukraine was a puppet state at this point with rigged elections.  Bush was unable to read the warning signs evincing a degrading relationship to come.  There's the infamous anecdote of his that he knew he could trust Putin when he saw he wore a crucifix.  Bush met and exceeded his reputation as inept and relied increasingly on Cheney.  And Cheney's business interests aligned just fine with Russia being Russia.  

Obama despite his campaign slogans about change, was a status quo president.  Still, he did the most to thwart Putin, intentionally and unintentionally.  Putin preferred the Bush years and almost every meeting with Obama irked him.  He went off on him for referring to Russia as a 'regional power'.  Big red flag there.  Ukraine's defiance of Russian interference and Putin's subsequent expansionism came very late in his presidency, but Obama [initiated a mandate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine_Freedom_Support_Act_of_2014) to assist Ukraine against future aggression.  This is also when the US and UK started training and modernizing UA's army.  Obama put Biden in charge of it.  Biden was actually wrong in his initial characterization of Putin's Russia and assumed its economy would force it to retreat from global conflict.  As it turned out Russia's economy bounced back somewhat.  But he wasn't wrong about his characterization of Putin himself.  In his memoirs as VP, he reportedly told Putin in private Bush may have thought he'd 'gotten a sense of his soul', but he didn't think he had one.  Putin agreed.  Biden (under Obama) supported Russia's inclusion in the WTO, on the provision that Putin should step down.

Expect Japan, Australia (if they even get involved), Sweden, Finland, Ukraine, UAE, and South Korea (out of pure necessity) on the NATO side.  Maybe Taiwan takes the opportunity?

Iran, Syria, North Korea, and Belarus (if Lukashenko is still in charge) would be on China/Russia's side.  Probably Iraq.  If Belarus ousts Lukashenko, then they could declare for NATO since they'd have to take a side due to their location.  They'd try to start taking over the other former Soviet countries in that area as well.  I'd imagine the militias in Yeman and Lebanon would side against the US, so those two countries might end up in civil wars with the militias backed by China/Russia.

Afghanistan stays the fuck out unless they get invaded (not recommended) and likely shoots down anything and everything that touches their country.  It would be in both sides' interest to just leave them alone.

The absolute wildcard is Israel.  They might end up on NATO's side by default because of Syria, Iran, and Iraq.  

I don't know enough about African or Central/South American geopolitical ties to guess what they'd do. 

The NATO side seems stacked but we have no idea what China is actually capable of doing militarily and the world economy would be absolutely fucked.

Russia's military does not have the funding to maintain the size of the arsenal they claim.   Full stop.  The US has difficulty maintaining the readiness of our arsenal, which is smaller than Russia's, yet our budget for it slightly matches or exceeds the budget for *their entire armed forces*.

But that doesn't mean it's worth finding out how many of them *do* work.    A key part of deterrence theory is that it doesn't really matter whether the weapons in question are usable; only that they *could* be used.  Plausible uncertainty is as valuable a currency as actual warheads, because the goal of having a stockpile of nuclear warheads is you *don't ever use them.*

Nukes? Unlikely. If it happened I imagine “the West” would convene to talk about it. What they decide to do would be very dependent on what happened. Big nuke? Maybe respond. Little nuke? Probably not much.

Edit: By “not much” I mean the same as chemical, extremely sanctions, but also more grandstanding, sending aid, etc, but “the West” just can not risk nuclear war. 

###I don’t think people understand how dangerous a nuclear war would be. 

At best imagine a 3-5 year period where no plant-based food could be grown enough to support more than a single country. 

Cereals are gone. Anything that used wheat is gone (bread, thickened soups). Anything plant based is gone (all soups that have anything but meat). Lentils, beans, and so on, all of them are gone for a few years. 

I mean… outside of meat, it’s all gone globally. There’d be just enough, in the right areas, for pockets to survive but the fight over those resources would be part of the war. It would just become a no-mans-land everywhere. 

Beyond that the only meat we’d have, which isn’t enough nutrients, would basically stagger after the plants died/became too sparse. 

No oil to heat your home. No money for alternative heating like electric or wind, because they’re still paid for with money from other sectors. 

Most of us would either die, or be so impoverished that it’s not funny. Americans, at least, (like me) would suddenly be plunged into the Middle Ages. Other less well off places might literally disappear due to lack of ability to trade *or* feed themselves locally. 

Humanity would irrevocably change, and we’ve already picked the low hanging fruit. The easy to access materials are mostly used up. We can’t just start over - there’s not enough easy coal for power, and the oil might be there but without a way to get it we can’t use it. Copper, iron, gold, silver, they’ve been picked heavily - we need to use deep resources now to get them. Without those resources we just don’t have meaningful access.  

Without easy enough access, we can’t start over. That’s it, it might be the end of humans as a technologically “advanced” race, as we know it. We’d have all the DNA to be smart, but no resources to capitalize on it.

If pre invasion he'd just said he couldn't rule out western involvement, that would have left Putin with a huge question mark over what would happen if he invaded and a huge additional risk factor to weigh up- not knowing what NATO would do might have deterred him.

Similarly when the choice came to start bombarding ukrainian cities, if Biden had just said he couldn't rule out the possibility of a no fly zone if atrocities occurred, that would have left Putin with some uncertainty about whether the risk of NATO intervention justified targetting civilians en masse.

Now, it is absolutely insane to rule out western involvement if russia uses WMDs in Ukraine- again, ruling it out just leaves Putin with no real reason not to, because that risk is not there.

Even if Biden's deeply held position is under no circumstances should america get involved- why say so? Why give putin effectively a green light and a guarantee that there is absolutely no risk of american involvement?  I think those repeated statements ruling out American involvement are purely due to domestic political considerations- Biden doesn't want to look weak after the afghanistan shambles so he got on the front foot and staking out his position so noone can accuse him of flipflopping or backing down if he refuses to act later.

The problem is, that approach has made it far far more likely that russia will invade and far more likely they will openly commit atrocities.

You'd have a few hundred available as bombs to be dropped by bombers.  And possibly a few hundred sitting in submarine missile bays parked somewhere God only knows.  These are all strategic weapons with yields in the 100kt - 1MT.  

Then, a few thousand of them would be tactical nukes.  Much, much  smaller yield.  Things like nuclear artillery shells, or nuclear torpedoes.  Most of these will be on the order of a few kt or maybe 10's kt. 

The strategic nukes are a non starter.  Deploying any of these will trigger global launch/MAD.  The question has always been smaller tactical nukes used on a battlefield.  Would powers launch strategic assets if a tactical nuke was used?  Guess that depends.  Some people say no, some aren't so sure.

For a recent case, just look at Syria, which I watched quite a bit. For a older case, just compare the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan compared to the US's. Theirs was MUCH more brutal.

In Syria, Russia deliberately targeted hospitals, clinics, and water treatment plants. Russian war planes would bomb civilian targets. Then they would return and bomb a second time [in a “double tap”](https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/middleeast/syria-hospital-attack-russia/index.html) in order to kill rescuers who had arrived to help.

Russia committed war crimes in support of a dictator who gassed his own people. They committed egregious war crimes to prop up one of the worse mass murderers in the last half century, but the U.S. bombed the comically evil ISIS (which was partially created by Assad to weaken the resistance), so really is Russia so bad?

Why do you think that entire section of the world - the entirety of Central and Eastern Europe (outside some outliers such as Serbia - and even there the opinion seems to be shifting) - hate Russia with a passion? Do you think Germans were the only ones with labor camps or mass murders? The Soviets continued to use those methods long, long after WW2 ended. 

You think that it's bad now? With some cities attacked and probably tens of thousands dead? If Ukraine falls it's going to be oh so much worse. Russia will bleed it dry economically to try and prop up its own economy (as it did during USSR days) and its people will be repressed, tortured and butchered. Do you really think the majority of Ukrainians want to go back to being basically slaves and second class citizens under a neanderthalic regime such as Russia - after 30 years of more or less democracy? It wasn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than ANY future under Russian occupation or control.

- Russia is cut off from importing electronic chips and has minimal talent and manufacturing capacity itself. This type of industry takes decade to spin up. This will wreck the quality of life of Russians. Hospital equipment, luxury electronics, cars, cloud servers, automated manufacturing, etc are all fucked.

[This](https://acoup.blog/2020/03/20/collections-why-dont-we-use-chemical-weapons-anymore/) article is about chemical weapons on the surface, but it goes into **great depth** on the ""modern system"" of warfare *(what the US and West is so good at)* and the older ""static system"" of warfare *(what Russia has devolved into and what regimes like Iraq did)* and helped explain to me a lot of the strategic failures Russia is experiencing.   It also explains why the Russians always fall back to things like chemical weapons when they fail to achieve their goals using more modern tactics.

Essentially, Ukraine has adopted a lot of modern system elements in their high-initiative squad-level tactics *(which themselves mesh incredibly well with the idea of a ""protacted war"" strategy below)* and is fighting a  military that has a lot of modern system toys but lacks the expertise to be anything but a static system.

&#x200B;

[This](https://acoup.blog/2022/03/03/collections-how-the-weak-can-win-a-primer-on-protracted-war/) article talks about the concept of ""Protracted War"" which is, simply put, the actual strategic principle that Ukraine is employing to repel the Russians, with far more success than even the author anticipated at the time of writing.    We are deep into ""Phase 2"" of what this describes *(strategic stalemate).*   It links to other really interesting articles about related concepts like Defense in Depth that are also worth checking out.

I understand that Zeman was 100% pro-Putin before the invasion and is horrible president without manners but he clearly condemned these actions and was the first one to call for SWIFT ban, he is NOT against the sanctions at all. Huge surprise coming from him though. Speech:

Dear fellow citizens,in the early hours of this morning, the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine. This is an act of unprovoked aggression that needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms, not just in words, but also in deeds. I like Russian culture, I respect the sacrifices of the Russian people in the Second World War, but that does not mean that I will agree to a foreign army entering the territory of a sovereign state without a declaration of war. I have studied President Putin's speech this morning in detail and I will respond to it with a single sentence. Perceived or real mistakes, such as the bombing of Yugoslavia or the entry into Iraq, cannot be a justification for mistakes of one's own. Russia is committing a crime against peace by doing so.

I said a few days ago that the Russians are not fools and that they will not attack Ukraine. I admit I was wrong. The irrational decision of the leadership of the Russian Federation will cause significant damage to the Russian state itself. I believe that it is time to resort to much harsher sanctions than were originally planned, and I am thinking in particular of the so-called SWIFT sanction, which is an international banking or financial network that would have meant the exclusion of the Russian Federation from the payment system. The madman needs to be isolated and defended against not just with words, but with concrete measures.

I would like to call on our citizens to calm down. I would like to express my full support for Ukraine, its leadership and its people. Tomorrow afternoon, I will be attending a video conference of the Heads of State of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and I have invited Prime Minister Fiala to this video conference, because I believe that, although we may differ in our views on the state budget, we need to act in complete unity in this serious situation.

I believe that the situation will calm down, not by cowardly compromise, but by a measured response against the aggressor. I deeply regret that this is happening, but we must behave like brave people who will not allow aggression in their own interests.Thank you for your attention.

MiG-21s are famed for being flying coffins in *good* conditions, and this is from when they were new. They're ancient and on the cusp of what's still relevant as a jet fighter, they're the oldest MiG in military use (excluding North Korea who claim not to retire anything) and only in limited service. Within a few years they'll be a historic warbird. Heavy snow, low cloud ceiling and zero visibility is not a smart decision when flying older fast jets.

Likewise, SAR helicopters have a significantly higher accidentally rate than average rotorcraft, because they're flying in a repeating pattern close to the ground, if the weather is as bad as claimed that might mean less than a hundred feet from the ground and controlled flight into terrain (literally just crashing into the ground) becomes highly likely at that point. Low altitude and low visibility in hilly areas do not mix.

Yeah, it's sketchy but these kinds of accidents are actually not uncommon. Dozens of military aircraft crash that you never hear about, even following aviation news specifically. It's likely compounded by high tensions, pilots flying under stressful or rushed conditions (chances are that the Puma was pushing the clock to ensure it wasn't a shoot down), and everyone flying a lot more stuff than usual. The combination is simple statistics.

Although there were glancing media reports about it over the years, it wasn’t widely reported on until 2009, when author Taylor Branch published his book The Clinton Tapes, based on his interviews with the president.

>“Secret Service agents discovered Yeltsin alone on Pennsylvania Avenue, dead drunk, clad in his underwear, yelling for a taxi,” Branch wrote in his book. “Yeltsin slurred his words in a loud argument with the baffled agents. He did not want to go back into Blair House, where he was staying. He wanted a taxi to go out for pizza.”

>When Branch asked Clinton how the situation ended, the president shrugged and said, “Well, he got his pizza.” But the next night, Clinton recalled, Yeltsin tried to do it again.

>“Eluding security, he made his way down the back stairs into the Blair House basement, where a building guard mistook him for a drunken intruder,” Branch wrote. “Yeltsin was briefly endangered until converging Russian and American agents sorted out everyone’s affiliation.” Because the guards mistook him for an intruder, “Clinton thought this incident, although contained within Blair House, exposed even greater risk than the pizza quest.”

But ignore what the Polish president (of course he'd be the most jumpy) or a minister in the UK has to say.

Putin started this war in Ukraine because he did a cost benefit analysis. He thought the war would end quick, Ukraine would fold, not fight, and thus the west's reaction would be muted.

He was wrong, hugely, but the fact that he did such in the first places means hes not suicidal. Ukrainian reaction may have surprised him, but there is no guessing reaction to using nuclear weapons.

Lets say hypothetically, Russia gasses Kyivs and in response NATO begins bombing Russian armor and artillery in Ukraine to prevent further attacks. What, you think Putin is just going to start nuking everyone?

He did a cost benefit analysis to start the war, so he isnt suicidal. He is not going to ramp up escalation in such a way that GUARANTEES his own death, guarantees Russia's death, and guarantees the death of the world. Its just stupid.

Realistcially the only two ways Russia or ANY nuclear state will nuke someone is if they are nuked first, or, their home territory is invaded and they need to save themselves.",False,1647146291.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0getea,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

I don't agree with Putin about Europe or anything.

Lets take Belarus and protests there. The whole thing triggered because Lukashenko put male opposition leaders to the jail and let Tikhanovskaya be a candidate. The majority of people voted for her while Lukashenko had to steal and draw himself 75-80% votes. Then massive protests have started, sanctions and now Lukashenko has lost any of credibility in the eyes of the world, now is a yesman to Putin.That's all was preventable.

While it is technically true that when a country has an Article 5 incident, it has to come up for debate, the entire point of NATO and specfically Article 5 it from a diplomatic strategy, is to deny Russia--or any other aggressor--any room to deliver a ""death by a thousand cuts.""   That is, a bunch of tiny incrementally hostile actions to NATO members that, individually, would not be worthy of response, but if done all at once, would be.

&#x200B;

That's why there's the constant, unambiguous ""we will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full power of NATO's military"" rhetoric that comes with it.  That *must* remain a credible threat that is followed through for the purpose of the alliance to remain viable.  It's foundational to NATO's defensive integrity.   Thus, it **literally is** in some ways a tripwire; or at least as close to one as you can get in geopolitics.    Reference the below:

This quote from the first sums it up well:

&#x200B;

^(""In essence then, what holds NATO together is a promise – you defend me, I will defend you and we’ll all defend each other. Consequently, it is essential that the largest states in NATO maintain credibility in that promise, both to assure allies but also to deter enemies. Bluffing, which might imply that NATO itself is also a bluff, is thus dangerous: it degrades deterrence and increases the chance of a much wider, more destructive war – either because an outside aggressor realizes they can pick off smaller NATO members and does so, collapsing the alliance and leading to a flurry of conventional wars in Europe OR because that outside aggressor miscalculates, Article 5 holds, NATO goes to war as the treaty stipulates and, well…if the world ends, it ends."")",1647185309.0,1647184439.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0hx3xn,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

They will starve if this continues, the West KNOWS what these sanctions are. You can say it's Putins fault for not supporting their people but we all know what wealth is left after the sanctions will be focused at the top.

Take the oligarchs yachts, fuck Chelsea off, target the rich holiday homes if the ones in power, don't target the poorer people that can't do shit no matter how much they may want to.

Tsar Nicholas I — Emperor of Russia, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Finland — who brought Russia into the Crimean War and whose domestic and foreign policies are considered disastrous, died on March 2, 1855.  
Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili (better known to the world as Joseph Stalin) — Chair of the Ministers of the Soviet Union and Supreme Commander of the Red Army — totalitarian and killer of millions by famine, died on March 5, 1953. Happy Stalin’s Death Day!  
Tsar Alexander II — Emperor of Russia, King of Congress Poland and Grand Duke of Finland — pacifist, emancipator of serfs, and generally less of a dick than many historical Russian leaders (a low bar, to be sure) — still was enough of a dick to his lower half blown off by a bomb by the “People’s Will” movement on March 13, 1881.  
Iván IV Vasilyevich (better know to the world as Ivan the Terrible) — grand prince of Moscow and the first to declare himself Tsar of all Russia — general rage-a-holic and purge-a-holic, a-hole behind the massacre of Novogrod and the burning of Moscow by Tatars, and the murder of his own son, died on March 28, 1584.

Those who are able to do so often want nothing to do with the West: they want power, they want resources and opportunities, they want to use this situation for another round of repression and violence for the sake of privilege. And these people, strange as it may sound, they are much scarier than Putin's dogs - there are a lot of corrupt politicians among the current ones, a lot of thieves. 

Those next will be murderers in the literal sense of the word, greedy for power and the opportunities that such cruelty provides. We've been through this once before. This is why the Bolsheviks and later Beria and Stalin came to power in the end. Violence that killed other violence. 

And the situation with Ukraine is irrelevant here - Ukraine is a young country striving for democracy without hysteria around the ""imperial problem"" (if you want, I will write a post and explain it in more detail), there are much fewer resources, territories, basic financial opportunities, privileges from oppression. If there is a big revolution, the only more or less positive outcome is a primary coup in Belorussia, then the breakup of Russia into small federal states in the manner of the U.S. with a strong self-government. But here, too, you can not be sure that the next round of cruelty will not start collecting the ""imperial land"" again.",False,1647179994.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0hol7y,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

They might say it's because ""fallout is spreading into NATO countries"", which may be a half truth, but in my eyes if Russia shows they aren't afraid to use nuclear weapons, NATO might feel a need to ""neutralize the threat"" (which of course could just mean a volley of nuclear weapons toward strategic Russian targets. 

Like I said, this would be an all out nuclear war we're talking about, but the idea of mutually assured destruction is that the presence of nukes in other countries should scare you from using yours at all, be it against nuclear power or not. NATO may feel that if they don't ""stand up"" against the use of nuclear weapons (ironically, with more nuclear weapons) that they're just giving countries free passes to use them against non-nuclear nations. 

There's a reason after all that Putin hasn't launched nuclear attacks yet, and from the shelling of cities it's clearly not from a fear of taking innocent life, he's more than fine with that. The reason he hasn't yet (and beyond that, why they've never been used in warfare since 1945, when the US had the only nuclear arms on the planet) is that using them lets everyone know you're not afraid of their nuclear weapons, which gives NATO a perfect place to step in and 'prove them wrong'. (And again, I don't think that's right, I just think that that's the current power struggle structure this world is in.)

Like I said, I don't want NATO to step in, because of what it could cause.

One reaches a point where the other side is so far out of agreement with accepted norms of behavior that the normal calculus of avoiding conflict with a nuclear power no longer holds.

If one assumes that the normal, rational calculation of actions don't hold and future conflict is inevitable, it's better to fight the battle now on our terms than in a future time when it's not so well defined.

That is, you need to look ahead in the game.  Everyone would have been better off fighting Hitler a couple years earlier, and the total human cost would have been less.

It becomes very difficult to justify to one's citizenry holding back, if you're seeing chemical weapon attacks on Ukrainian cities and/or genocide, too, *even if* it is more rational to hold back from a game theoretical perspective.

Emanuel ends by stating that the evidence of other models point to substantial scavenging of the smoke by rain.\[166\] Emanuel also made an ""interesting point"" about questioning proponent's objectivity when it came to strong emotional or political issues that they hold.\[11\]

I said NATOs _policy_. Not NATO altogether. 

NATO's _policy_ is first and foremost, preventing conflict and war. That has been evidenced in the past with the numerous interventions that they have taken place in. In this instance, conflict/war is best prevented by _not getting directly involved_ as that would almost certainly escalate the conflict on a global scale. Not like Bosnia/Kosovo/Afghanistan,  where the opposition literally did not have the military capability to sustain a world conflict. Very localized, meaning directly intervention was the best option 

Secondly, NATO's policy is defense of all member nations. The whole ""an attack on one is an attack on all"" mantra.

They're claiming 374 tanks, and we've got visual confirmation of just about 200.  I'd be a bit surprised if over half of all russian tank losses during the campaign have already been documented, seen, checked, categorized and added.

76 planes sounds like a lot, but we do have confirmation of 12 and can crash anywhere, without necessarily easy road access.

Same with the 86 helicopters.

140 artillery pieces claimed, with 50 having been visually confirmed.  That'd be over a third confirmed, or basically 1:2 confirmed not confirmed.  

If we take their ""APCs"" to be IFVs, AFVs, and APCs, that's ~350, so still ~30% confirmed.  

MLRSs, same thing 20 confirmed to 62 claimed.

No idea what the two boats are, but there *was* at least one confirmed hit of some boat with a barrage.

600 vehicles seems like an underestimate.

Same with the fuel trucks.

The UAV's are only off by 1.

We have visual confirmation of 31 SAMs taken out, 1 radar, and 1 jammer.  I highly doubt that every single SAM system attacked and taken out has already been documented.

That leaves ""troops"".  If I assume that they've taken out 374 tanks, and each BTG has [10 tanks assigned](https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/earmor/content/issues/2017/spring/2Fiore17.pdf), they've removed ~37 BTGs worth of tanks from the battlefield.

If I just pretend that ""by the time you've lost *all* of your tanks, half of your BTG is probably dead, wounded, or fled"", then at [600 men per BTG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion_tactical_group), that represents some ~11-12k taken out.

Belarus army was rated as the worst in Europe in a recent assessment of military capability. It is believed to have a FFPR (functional force projection range) of about 40 miles in the best of circumstances, these are not the best of circumstances. That is a joke in military terms btw.

The Syrians were called in to provide support in terms of urban combat however they lack the training, experience and equipment to fight effectively in the Eastern European theatre. They are also fighting just for the money with no ideological component which leads to massive force inertia.

Make no mistake: they knew they weren't fooling anyone.

NATO is an alliance, not an homogeneous body. If Polish territory gets threatened, why would they sit back and take it in order not to escalate? What if there are civilian casualties?

d633f42bf2e5910fd58bc3420fbb94f1,tcxrfr,i0gnje0,"As threats of military aggression from China grow, the island nation of Taiwan needs a credible military deterrent more than ever. But Taiwan’s military is in a crisis it can barely admit exists.  
  
Even as the military refits itself with flashy U.S. arms purchases, such as M1 Abrams tanks and F-16V fighter jets, its front-line units are hollowed out, and the entire reserve system is so dysfunctional that few experts or serving military personnel believe it can make a real military contribution in the event of a war. These problems are well documented but continue to be downplayed, if not outright ignored, by Taiwan’s political leadership—and there is no clear plan to solve the crisis.  
  
On paper, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) has 215,000 budgeted positions among all branches, of which 188,000 are soldiers and the rest civilian employees. Only 153,000 of those positions were filled in 2018—just 81 percent of the personnel the military should have. But even that number doesn’t tell the complete story.Only 153,000 of those positions were filled in 2018—just 81 percent of the personnel the military should have. But even that number doesn’t tell the complete story.  
According to a Taiwanese army lieutenant colonel in active service, who asked for only his last name, Lin, to be used, all the army’s front-line combat units he knows of—including armor, mechanized infantry, and artillery troops—currently have effective manpower levels of between 60 and 80 percent. This figure is consistent with Taiwanese media reports, which cite MND figures provided to Taiwan’s parliament, the Legislative Yuan, acknowledging that few front-line units have more than 80 percent of their positions filled.  
  
“That number might not seem so bad until you realize it means at least a third of your tanks are useless in a war because there’s no one to man them,” said Lin, who most recently served as a battalion commander within one of army’s armor brigades.  
  
The personnel shortfalls are a clear consequence of the ill-executed transition from conscription to an all-volunteer military over the past few years. It was a political decision made during Ma Ying-jeou’s administration and continued by current President Tsai Ing-wen, despite their coming from different parties. And despite Tsai’s tough rhetoric about defending Taiwan during her successful recent reelection bid, and her vow to thwart Chinese aggression, she has shown no sign of stepping in to fix the problems.  
  
Universal conscription is mandated in Article 20 of the Taiwanese Constitution, as in several other countries that face an imminent military threat, such as South Korea or Israel (where women are included but some minorities excluded). For some years, before 2017, the term of conscription service in Taiwan was just a year, which was already short compared with South Korea’s 18-22 months, depending on the military branch, or Israel’s 32 months. Most officers felt that the single year of service wasn’t enough for the military to utilize draftees’ full potential but enough to at least turn a recruit into an average soldier.  
  
But 2017’s changes slashed the conscription period to just four months. Most draftees serve even less, as up to two weeks can be deducted if they’ve completed military training classes in high school and college. The four-month conscripts typically receive five weeks of basic training before they are assigned to field units for more specialty training. But they’re more a burden than an aid, not treated seriously by career or noncommissioned officers as their short stays mean they are seen as guests rather than soldiers.  
  
“By design, they don’t participate in any field exercise or combat readiness training anyway,” Lin said. “We just tell them to stay safe and don’t get into trouble. It’s basically a summer camp.” Several individuals who recently completed this four-month service described similar experiences in interviews.  
  
One of the stated aims of the all-volunteer reform was to professionalize the service, staffing the military’s rank and file with a cadre of career-oriented volunteer soldiers who usually serve a minimum term of four years. Despite MND’s talking point that each year’s recruitment drive always hits the set targets and brings with it a fresh crop of volunteers, the rushed transition to an all-volunteer military has clearly damaged the Taiwanese army’s manpower pool—especially on the front line.",False,1647151057.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0gh8g7,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

d633f42bf2e5910fd58bc3420fbb94f1,tcxrfr,i0gnl2i,"The reason for the hollowing out of front-line troops is simple. Unlike conscripts, who could be assigned entirely based on to the needs of the military, volunteer soldiers among the lower enlisted ranks can and usually do seek transfers to units considered desirable—rear-echelon troops such as training schools, garrison units, signal corps, and so forth. Although transfer opportunities are limited, soldiers almost always find a way. This means that armor, mechanized infantry, and artillery units are always in desperate shortage of enlisted soldiers—even though they are expected to be the ones bearing the brunt of ground fighting against the formidable People’s Liberation Army (PLA) ground force if it comes ashore.  
  
A popular yet cynical explanation as to why these Taiwanese soldiers dislike front-line units simply postulates a common aversion to tougher training and combat duty. But interviews with several enlisted ranks painted a more complex picture. Most complained that the food and living conditions left much to be desired—front-line soldiers must split their time between bases and on field exercises. That, on top of the fact they have far more weapons, vehicles, and equipment to clean and maintain, means these posts are perceived as more work for little reward. The existing shortages also cause an even heavier burden of work on the soldiers left—prompting more of them to put in for transfers.  
  
Polls show varied public opinion on these issues. In 2015, one legislator cited a poll that showed almost 60 support for a return to conscription. In response, the MND cited another poll that claimed 60 percent were satisfied with the transition to all-volunteer forces. At the end of the day, it all seems to come down to how the question is phrased by the pollsters.  
  
No matter which poll you believe, it is clear that the two successive presidents over the past decade, Ma and Tsai, had little or no political interest in the political hassle of bringing back the longer conscription length, despite the evidence of the damage being done to military readiness. Even Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu, who lost in the recent presidential election representing the Kuomintang (KMT) party, also declined to advocate a complete return to conscription but proposed a “hybrid approach” that he did not specify the details for.  
  
Chieh Chung, a senior assistant research fellow at Taiwan’s National Policy Foundation, commented that the personnel shortage is a problem well documented by the military itself but has never entered their calculations. Chung, who has worked for several years in Taiwan’s parliament as a legislative advisor focusing on defense issues, said the military’s own exercises and computer simulations always assume all units would have at least 90 percent fighting strength at the beginning of a war—an assumption that might have been true in the conscription era but is a far cry from reality today.  
  
Several officers who have participated in the computer-simulated phase of the annual Han Kuang exercises in recent years also pointed out this obvious flaw. That raises the question of how many of the Taiwanese military’s simulations of its own ability to hold off a Chinese invasion are based on now purely hypothetical soldiers.  
  
These personnel issues would not be so serious if the military had a functional reserve force. On paper, this enormous reserve force is said to be more than 2 million strong.These personnel issues would not be so serious if the military had a functional reserve force. On paper, this enormous reserve force is said to be more than 2 million strong. Once activated, these reservists are supposed to fill existing shortages across regular field units, and reinforce casualties, while creating fresh reserve formations from virtually nothing to bolster overall defense, according to the Reserve Command’s own words.  
Just about everything in these talking points is pure fantasy, according to James Huang, a retired army lieutenant colonel who has since become a prolific writer on defense issues and military history, with many followers on Facebook. Huang said there was “no way whatsoever” any of Taiwan’s reserves would reinforce existing field units, despite the proven success of the system elsewhere in the world, especially Israel.  
  
That’s the case regardless of whether the reservist is a conscript with four months’ training or a five-year veteran paratrooper just discharged from the special forces. The established practice of Taiwan’s Reserve Command, according to Huang, is not to send reservists back to their previous units but to lump everyone together into the newly activated reserve infantry brigades that possess no specialty, no vehicles, and no equipment except rifles (often older types) and are led by called-up reservist officers who have little experience commanding such ad hoc units.",False,1647151088.0,t3_tcxrfr,t1_i0gnje0,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

If Japan not surrendering in light of nuclear weapons threat is not brinkmanship then I don't know what is. 

>No one knew about nukes and their effects at the time

The effects of ionising radiation were understood for years to be harmful. There is no doubt that scientists communicated the risks to governments. Some commanders didn't care what the health effects were. Japanese social elite were among the most well-educated people in the world at that time, and the country was sufficiently industrially advanced and scientific in order to begin their own nuclear weapons program. The Japanese Army Command was aware what nuclear weapons were and asked their scientific teams to verify the usage of a nuclear bomb after it happened. 

Oppenheimer didn't care about the health effects of radiation from a bomb when used against an enemy and basically refused to acknowledge it. He cared only about its destructive power in destroying an ideological enemy. They all knew the effects from studies done on test subjects in prior bomb tests. Regardless, the residual health effects were not a concern of anyone in the war. It's kind of an irrelevant point - their main utility was as a very large and relatively cost-effective bomb.

Most governments in the world which had a competent energy/Physics department knew that nuclear weapons of vast destructive power were possible since fission was discovered and disseminated as a great discovery in the global scientific community. 

>so it is rewriting history to say they ignored the situation

It's not. The warning signs were there since 2014. Up until days before the invasion, Ukraine government was still proclaiming that the rest of the world was wrong and that nothing would happen. For all the years between 2014 and now, they ignored the security situation inside their own borders and just played 'woe is me'. 

If a country is going to give up their nuclear weapons as Ukraine did, then they need to build a sufficiently armed and funded conventional force. That is the game of national security and it always has been, whether it is 1980 or 2020, whether or not your name is Ukraine, Poland, Myanmar, North Korea, or Cuba. 

Nothing about this invasion can be called a 'new concept' in global security/peace that has taken the world by shock. The Ukraine government had no excuse for failing to fund its armed forces over the decades except for the fact that for a long time, those in power in Ukraine were pro-Russia or at best, didn't care about the concept of Ukraine as an independent country. The FSB specifically placed people in positions of authority in Ukraine which did their best to increase corruption and embezzlement of defence funds. 

I'm not saying Europe and the US should not have done more to help Ukraine but for some reason they have failed to assess the risks properly which should have been obvious since Crimea. Ukraine should have been armed to the teeth years ago but when other countries failed to reach out, the buck absolutely stops at Ukraine's government for failing to act sooner. It's hardly Zelenskyy's fault or the fault of ordinary people. Poroshenko can probably take a lot of the blame, knowing how corrupt the domestic weapons industry was and how ineffective the state-owned defence enterprises were. They should have consulted foreign firms for rapid modernisation and greater accountability of funds, and increased the budgets dramatically. 

It certainly doesn't mean other countries should now form a coalition and intervene directly. This is history and 'just the way the cookie crumbles'. There was no new lesson here and now those who had the power to do things differently in the past will have to live with their choices and the consequences. It's not like Russia will get away free in this, though. They are just about destroying their own country economically to support Putin's ego. 

Morals are just words on paper and thoughts by useless scholars. They are no more useful than laws when navigating the dangers of the world.

And attacking Ukraine first actually weakened him, especially from an economical point of view, to wage a world war you need a lot of money. Not only that but if he tries to move troops from Ukraine it is pretty obvious that the Ukrainian people are going to seize on the occasion to rebel and free themselves, and at that point he would either need to send troops back in Ukraine to fight possible insurgents or give up on Ukraine and leave its flank exposed, not to mention that Ukraine is virtually surrounded on all sides by NATO countries except for Moldova. Furthermore attacking Ukraine first put all the surrounding NATO countries on high alert, 100000 NATO troops are in Eastern Europe, two Patriot Missile systems are in Poland, Germany just spent 100 billion euros on his military which are added to their normal 50 billion euros, this means that Germany just spent on its military more than double of what Russians spend yearly for their military.

They are called up at most once every two years by the Reserve Command to receive refresher training for five to seven days. In practice, such training rarely consists of more than just basic drills and a short practice session at the rifle range. A reservist corporal who was a veteran M60 tank gunner, for example, will be activated only as an infantry rifleman even if one of the army’s active armor brigades has tanks sitting unmanned in the base.  
  
“If we go to war, the soldiers currently on roster are all that we have,” said Lin, the lieutenant colonel, who pointed out that he had never heard of any plan to reinforce units he commanded with reserve soldiers. “At best, they might start combining depleted units. We are supposed to fight until everyone is dead or can’t fight anymore.”  
  
And even if Taiwan somehow manages to muster dozens of fresh reserve infantry brigades before Chinese troops come ashore, Huang said they would be little more than cannon fodder consider how poorly the military has trained them in peacetime and the fact that there is not even a clear plan to fit them into the overall defense strategy.  
  
“Show me 2 million rifles in the stockpile, and I will believe Taiwan has a 2-million-strong reserve force,” Huang said. “The military can’t even tell how many reserve troops they will need to activate across Taiwan, let alone where and how to deploy them when the shooting starts across the Taiwan Strait.”  
  
Other military officers and defense experts confirmed the problems Huang cited. According to Jyun-yi Lee, an assistant research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, a recently created think tank affiliated with Taiwan’s MND: “It’s indeed clear to most of us that Taiwan’s reserve system, as it currently stands, will not contribute much to the military’s fighting strength, if at all. No one is pretending soldiers trained by four-month conscription will be effective. They exist for political, not military, reasons. Politicians don’t want to bring back longer conscription or tougher reserve training, as they fear doing so might make them unpopular.”  
  
To its credit, Taiwan’s MND finally began an experimental “reserve warrior program” in recent years that seeks to put skilled veterans back to their original units for refresher training up to a few days per month. Some 214 veterans were said to have signed up in 2019, which is obviously too low to function as a regular reserve force. The program so far seems to matter more to the air force, as it finally provides a channel for retired military pilots to fly again, according to one air force lieutenant familiar with the matter. So far one F-16 pilot and one C-130 pilot reportedly have signed up for the program.  
  
Former KMT legislator Hsu “Jason” Yu-Jen said U.S. Defense Department officials have privately expressed dismal assessments regarding Taiwan’s current force level and reserve system. Hsu quoted Pentagon officials as saying in 2019 that Taiwan’s buying of new F-16s and M1 Abram tanks by the Tsai administration was a “nice political gesture” yet they will hardly matter in a war when Taiwan cannot even man them properly in peacetime.  
  
But saying the problem out loud is a tough task in itself when both Taiwan’s international allies and the Taiwanese public want to hear a success story more than anything else—especially at a time when China’s propaganda machine is running at full speed to portrait Taiwan’s military as both incompetent and ineffective in the face of the PLA’s rapid expansion and modernization.  
  
“You have to acknowledge the existence of the problems before you can fix them,” said James Huang, who noted that some among the military community object to his outspokenness, though he decided to speak on record for this report anyway. “It’s about time someone starts telling the truth.”

No, the only point was to win. Using them to win illustrates the power but it's not the point. They were developed with the intention to use them. All countries maintain a serious intention to use nuclear weapons otherwise they don't work as a deterrent. 

>Bear in mind that from Ukraine's POV they had a written accord with both principle nuclear powers and internal turmoil as they struggled to throw off the chains of the cold war.

Accords are just words on paper between people who are probably now retired or dead of age. In history they are basically meaningless as soon as one party strays from the agreement which happens frequently. An agreement about not being invaded doesn't make any sense anyway. 

>It's bizarre to expect a country with a proxy Russian govt to be able to allocate defence spending intended to defend against Russia.

Of course and I have acknowledged that as a contributing factor but at the same time, they have had nearly a decade away from pro-Russian influence at the top in which to do something. What good is the social welfare budget now? Oh they improved infant mortality at hospitals since 2004, what good is that now? The focus of budgets should always be on defence and internal security stability until they are sovereign. If the main (and only) threat to Ukraine since the USSR fell was Russia, then until now Ukraine has not been a sovereign country and they should have recognised that. 

Maybe they should have refused to give up their WMD's without exchanging them for greater military supplies and technical assistance. The US cared for too much about Afghanistan by comparison, but if that is where their foreign policy/national security interests were then so be it, Ukraine simply had to work with what the circumstances were. 

> because we are at war with Russia (officially or not)

Only Ukraine is at war with Russia, officially or unofficially. NATO is purely a defence pact. If any of them attacks Russia, then all of them will become involved. Many countries might even leave the pact under such a unilateral scenario because it goes beyond the scope of what they signed up for. 

>And finally actually morals are powerful as they provide a framework that you can't buy.

Buying morals doesn't make any sense, this sentence is meaningless. Morals change all the time and to think that all Americans or at least all members of the US government and the military share the same morals is simply not true. Often when action counts, morals get thrown out the window because bombing a hospital full of expectant mothers is totally worth it if the enemy is storing their ammunition there, or drone-striking a wedding party because one bad guy is in attendance even if the other 100 people that die were all innocent, because their might not be another opportunity.

Ukrainian's are dying, no one else. Why would other countries care if it is just Ukrainians dying? It's quite literally not anyone's problem. Economic sanctions are something that is easy to carry out with fairly large advantages for most parties because they gain increased trade with more friendly parties and an opportunity for new investments and increased market share.

I think Putin is almost certain to be overthrown internally or mass civil disobedience leads to the collapse of local towns and administrations.
