The most popular 2nd group of the last 2 weeks: 

Sabotage of the state rallies on the 9th of May (should have another post cause there were MANY of them), 

Hand-delivered ""antiwar"" postcards in the postal mail boxes and in messengers, 

Antiwar inscriptions on banknotes — you just take a pen, write and give the money to ATM machine, 

Micro-stickers and green ribbons, which are put up everywhere in all cities and towns. They should be small enough to be not-destroyed in a few hours, but understandable.

Various support and promotion of the Legion of Liberty of Russia (a white and blue unit of Russian troops that fights on the side of Ukraine to free Russia from the P).

Day 82 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was again mostly quiet with some rare sounds of our artillery. Though the air raid alerts are almost constant every single day (even right now), nothing really happens during them, which is good, hopefully it will continue to be this way.

There haven’t been any new officially liberated settlements, but some unconfirmed reports are saying that our forces have already crossed the Donets river and got into a couple of new villages, that would make it easier for them to shell Russian supply routes to Izyum. Many official sources have been saying that our forces are conducting counteroffensives around Izyum, so this might be one of them.

Let’s see what will happen with people that were evacuated from Azovstal as POWs, honestly it’s pretty concerning, as we have already seen that they killed some of their POWs before. Hopefully Russians won’t act braindead and kill any of them, or our people will probably never surrender to them again, it will also most likely be the end of any negotiations and prisoner exchanges. 

Also almost right after some of our forces left Azovstal, there was a ton of reports saying that Russians fired around 12 cruise missiles at Lviv. Some of them might have hit a military target, but from what Lviv’s mayor said, most of them were intercepted, that could mean that some of those 12 missiles were actually interceptors.

From CNN's Niamh Kennedy in London

The leaders of Denmark, Iceland and Norway have welcomed Finland and Sweden's decision to apply for membership of NATO. 

""We strongly welcome Finland and Sweden’s decisions to apply for NATO membership,"" the three nations said in a joint statement.

""We note that the decisions by Finland and Sweden to apply for NATO membership are sovereign national decisions in line with Finland and Sweden’s right to choose their own security arrangements. Finland and Sweden have the right to pursue their accession process without any attempts of outside interference,"" the statement said.

More context: On Monday, the Swedish government announced its decision to apply for NATO membership after determining that membership ""is the best way to protect Sweden’s security in light of the fundamentally changed security environment following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.""

Last week, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Finland must apply for membership ""without delay"" and will complete the steps it needs to on the national level ""in the next couple of days.""

The three nations stressed Monday that Finnish and Swedish security are ""a matter of common concern to us all.""  

""Should Finland or Sweden be victim of aggression on their territory before obtaining NATO membership, we will assist Finland and Sweden by all means necessary,"" the three nations pledged. 

They also vowed to do their ""utmost to ensure a swift accession process, as Finland and Sweden already live up to the relevant criteria for NATO membership.""

The Ukrainian media made a montage of short videos taken with a phone by one of the Russian soldiers with English subtitles. They named the film - Occupator.

The film starts with a audio: “Tomorrow you will have to leave urgently, board number XXX. If you refuse, you all will be fired with punishment». 

The movie begins ten months before the war begins, when the guy graduates from the military academy and ends in April 2022 when he surrendered.

He must have really liked filming (at least in the video he joked that he dreamed of being a cameraman, not a military man), because it is atypical for Russians.   

It is a very difficult video to comprehend, first of all, because you have to be aware of the fact that people who went to war as aggressor’s soldiers are not much different from regular guys, some of them are beasts, but majority just drink too much beer, watch soccer, love their families and three months ago they thought that serving in the army was an honorable and well paid job (for Russian standards, of course).",1652742460.0,1652741848.0,t3_uqumkk,t3_uqumkk,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

President Erdogan says he won't agree to admit countries which apply sanctions on Turkey.

Sweden suspended arms sales to Turkey three years ago, following Ankara's military intervention in Syria. And according to the official Turkish news agency, both Finland and Sweden have rejected dozens of requests to extradite Kurdish militants who Turkey describes as terrorists.

Both countries are sending delegations to Ankara to try and solve the problem, but President Erdogan says they shouldn't bother.

He seems determined to extract a price for his precious vote.

On Sunday, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said he was confident that Finland and Sweden would both join, despite Turkish objections.

The issue is likely to dominate discussions between Mr Blinken and his Turkish opposite number in Washington on Wednesday. Having encouraged the two Nordic countries to apply, Washington won't want to let them down at the 11th hour.

Erdoğan says Turkey will not approve Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato

The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has said he will not approve Finland and Sweden joining Nato.

Reuters is reporting he has said Swedish and Finnish delegrations should not bother coming to Turkey to convince Turkey to approve their Nato bids.

Finland and Sweden, while both Nato partners, have long viewed membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia, their powerful eastern neighbour. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, however, has led to a radical rethink of their security policies.

Membership of Nato would require ratification by all existing members.

Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries.",False,1652724758.0,t3_uqumkk,t3_uqumkk,,0,12,0,12,0,0,

Ukraine wasn't close to joining NATO either and their intention was enough for Russia to go to war. Finland and Sweden have now both signaled their intentions to join officially -- that already aligns them with NATO and they can no longer be considered neutral in the geopolitical landscape.

If they aren't brought on board immediately because of Turkey's opposition, they will still likely be brought on board at some point and will be pushing for membership -- not sure how this changes anything from Russia's point of view other than it means they still have time to go to war with them before NATO will come to their defense, though I can't see that happening.

To be clear, his guess at actual killed is about half of what Ukraines gov claims, and in line with many OSINT folks. 10-12k Russian killed is his guess. It’s just a guess bc no one knows what the hell is going on casualty wise. Koffman is a Russia mil expert who grew up in Ukraine/Soviet Union (before anyone claims he is anti-Ukraine). 

The biggest issue IMHO is that 99% of people have no idea how casualty figures work, and use the word “killed” in place of all casualties. This is a massive problem because killed (KIA) almost always makes up well under half of all casualties. Killed in terms of casualties in war is a very specific and important term. So when the UKR gov claims 22k Russians killed, no one knows if that’s their actual KIA claim (very dubious at best but normal for wartime GOVs) or if that’s their claim for all Russian casualties combined. 

I’ll finish this comment by saying, that as someone who studies military history for 4 hours a day every day for fun, it’s very confusing now that a ton of people who are tuning into this war and don’t have a large working knowledge in this stuff, post. It’s basically impossible  to confirm most data (oryx is literally a magician and basically one of the only legit accurate trackers of current conflicts). That’s fog of war. Add in the daily propaganda from all sides and much of what’s posted about ends up being false. Then having people use the word killed without understanding, makes it even harder. I’m not asking anyone to change what they believe, who they believe, etc. if you want to believe Russia is winning, do you. If you want to believe Ukraine has killed 70,000 Russians, do you. I’m not posting to take a side or anything.

following that logic then Russian diplomatic language should suddenly sound quite reasonable and stable and not scary as their offensive capabilities lapse, because they'll now be wanting to calm everyone's fears and convince us that they're now suddenly reasonable and not fucking insane as they try to convince everyone that letting them keep their gains with a ceasefire is the best option.

This process will likely take months or a year. America has a notoriously slow legislative system, and other countries, like Turkey and Hungary, may attempt to use their vetoes to wring concessions from other members, and may delay the process to do so.

That's why the security guarantees from NATO members were so important. As a practical matter, an attack on Finland or Sweden now would likely trigger a war with most NATO members, even if not a formal invocation of Article 5.",False,1652712798.0,t3_uqumkk,t1_i8ti1ne,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

Russia's export economy is still strong. Oil, gas, uranium, wood, and metals continue to flow out to Europe, India, China and elsewhere. Its agricultural exports are now more profitable because it crippled one of its main competitors.

The problem is that, as much as the world's conservatives and nationalists might want to rail against globalism, there are nasty consequences to being cut off from the world's supply chains. 

Russia right now is having a hell of a time importing critical industrial and technical components needed not just to make new products, but even to maintain existing products and infrastructure. 

Everything from tractor parts to computer chips to specialized chemical reagents are either unavailable for purchase or only available at lower quality, in less quantity, for greater markup. To make matters worse, being cut off from most of the world's capital markets means it is very hard to obtain financing to fund start ups to produce these domestically - even if it were possible to replace access to an 8 billion person world economy with Russia's 144 million people. 

The net result is that when something breaks, its harder and more expensive to fix it. When you want new machinery to expand your production, its not available or is a worse product for more money. When you go to the store to buy a host of items - anything from tampons to commercial trucks, they're more expensive as the import market has dried up and there's increased purchasing competition for domestically produced versions. Even though Russia is pulling in billions of Euros from gas, spending them is a serious pain, and they take a big discount on the value as they have to move those Euros through countries and entities in a way that isn't hit by sanctions, and everyone involved takes a slice. 

Russia is also trying to prop their economy up in the short term by courting pain in the long term by hiking interest rates sky high to prop up their currency. This means anyone opening a business or buying a house faces prohibitive borrowing costs. In the short term, purchasing power is maintained, but in the long term they're limiting their capacity for economic growth.

These problems put a slow, steady pressure on an economy, constricting its efficiency and productivity. There's nothing there that will collapse the economy overnight, but a lot that will steadily degrade it in ways that will mount cumulatively. Things will also get much, much worse as Europe weans itself off of Russian gas and uranium.",False,1652723249.0,t3_uqumkk,t1_i8u9f2k,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

The area that borders Ukraine is the ""Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic"" better known as Transnistria. A narrow strip inside of Moldova that fought a war of independence when the Moldova became independent from the soviet union.  It is not recognized by any nation in the UN however Russia does keep a garrison of troops in the area as a defacto occupation to prevent it from being captured by Moldovan forces.

*Moldova has almost no military force to speak of*

*Transnistria only has a small local militia with almost no military equipment*

*the Russian force there numbers scantly 1500, it is so small and disconnected it could not attack the rest of Moldova, it could not attack Ukraine*

Recently there was a scare in Transnistria that Ukraine would attack, and apparent false flags occurred in the territory against governmental offices. The area is still on high alert, There is no current way for Russia  to get to the territory with new troops and it seems unlikely the Russian garrison will join the war in any way

I believe Romania has some sort of agreement with Moldova if ever Russia did attack, but if they engaged in a military conflict on their own against a Russian invasion, NATO would not get involved

I don't really know how to convince her that western media is lying about the front lines, I mean, both Russians and Ukrainians are on the internet and while both sides will argue about who is winning, not even the most generous pro Russian sources place Russian troops anywhere near the borders of Moldova.

Correct. Because Russia already shares a border with NATO via the Baltics.

The threat itself strictly pertains to NATO's hold on Ukraine. Putin's manifesto about Ukraine tells you all the ""need to know"", he and his circle do not view Ukraine as a real state. In his view, it's a piece of Russian land masquerading as a country.

I feel like we are still a long way away from this if Putin stays in charge. Russia/Putin isn’t going to give up all occupied areas, certainly not Crimea, just to remove sanctions. It’s seems a little premature to start “officially” shifting the narrative now. 

Just because Russia may not be able to maintain offensive operations for much longer doesn’t really mean much. There’s an entirely new phase of the war once Russia ceases offensive operations. Once that happens they will defend fortifications in areas that they took early with little to no resistance, Donbas/Luhansk/Kherson. 

Given that these areas were taken early and with little resistance, a lot of infrastructure and civilians are still intact/living. I doubt Ukraine will just relentlessly shell their own towns/cities/villages and citizens to try and expel Russia forces. “Guided munitions” does not magically mean there is zero collateral damage. Meaning this next phase of the war could take significantly more time than it took at stopping Russian offensives.

You have two physical armies actually running about, your own army training as themselves, and an aggressor or Opposing Force (OpFor) army, who are basically playing serious military dressup. They either use real enemy vehicles or decent mockups of them. Their units may be picked from participating forces (who then get to get inside the psyche of their enemy) or it may be a specially assembled OpFor from another nation or professional supplier (many retired veterans go work for OpFor simulation specialists).

The infantry generally use either blank firing adapters (BFAs) which mean the gun can fire blanks and the barrel end is protected if any debris does come loose. Using BFAs is more realistic because the guns recoil and go bang and make the associated noise and mess. There's usually a photo-electric or laser hit detection system. Sometimes, they only use hit detection systems instead, especially if they want to limit noise.

For larger vehicular stuff, the ""guns"" are usually rigged to something like a camera and then the ""kill"" is a photograph confirming a hit would have taken place.

Higher level strategic outcomes, e.g. advances, losses, tide of battle, are dictated both by the actions of the troops participating in the exercise and also by modelling of a larger-scale conflict if appropriate, e.g. this exercise might simulate the outcomes of other conflicts, perhaps in the Arctic or Pacific, that would determine each side's ability to continue to wage war. There's also some random-chance or what-if events and set-pieces, such as ""what if OpFor took out our long-range radio comms on day 3?"" that may or may not happen.

The other two are the towns of Velykyi Burluk and Kupyansk. Liberating all of them would totally cut the Russians off from Belgorod.

If the Ukrainians can take all three (big if) their forces would be very well positioned to envelope the Russians in Izyum, who would be tightly bunched up in a small area and extremely vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery bombardment.

Theoretically if they were able to march all the way to a town along the main road, liberate it, and hold it defensively, Izyum forces would eventually run out of fuel for their vehicles and have to break out in a different direction leaving half their shit behind.  

That's not going to happen, and the question is more how safely can Ukraine be a nuisance in the north such that Russia has to keep taking preventative measures.  All week I've been saying 'not very safely at all', because a) you have no new forces from Kharkiv yet, and with Sumy under attack they're really going to be stretched thin and in need of refit, and b) you have 20-30K Russians in the Izyum bridgehead and sending 1 btg 45 minutes uproad is all you need to push Ukraine back over the river.

Outside of physical material destruction, filters need to be replaced every 8 hours of chemical weapon exposure.  

Say everyone has a mask and they have a Costco sized warehouse of filters - do their masks have drinking tubes and accompanying canteens?  How many full pre sealed canteens do they have?  People absolutely cook in MOPP gear and therefore sweat a lot.

Do they have CBRN detection systems?  If so are they constantly monitored and can they sustain such an operational tempo?  If not, do they have educated sentries posted at potential chemical weapon deployment points who can raise the alarm for the main body or is everyone likely to succumb to a surprise attack?

Certain persistent chemical agents can last months under the right conditions (assuming they don’t keep up
a steady flow or random bursts of agent).  If the entire bunker system was saturated with persistent agents the options then might become: die due to dehydration, die due to starvation (there’s no way to eat in a mask), if the air becomes safe potentially still incur more losses due to surface contacts, people walking stirring up the agents, etc.

Politico put out a good article on this matter.

From today's Politico Paybook.

>On Sunday, JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO’s secretary general, summed up the implications of these developments: “Ukraine can win this war.”
>And that is exactly the problem according to a growing number of western officials and analysts who fear the fallout from what French President EMMANUEL MACRON called the “humiliation” of Russia.

>Macron is not alone. Matthew Karnitschnig, reports this morning:

>“After weeks spent fretting over what would happen if Russia crushed Ukraine, Western European leaders are now worried about what might happen if Ukraine actually wins. … One big concern is that a Ukrainian win could destabilize Russia, making it even more unpredictable and putting a normalization of energy links further out of reach. That’s why some western European capitals quietly favor a ‘face-saving’ resolution to the conflict, even if it costs Ukraine some territory.”

>The leaders of France, Germany and Italy are all stressing a ceasefire and peace deal at precisely the moment when Ukraine has reversed the tide.

>Karnitschnig notes that their fears of victory put them out of step with the Biden administration, which in recent weeks has talked about how Ukraine, in the words of Defense Secretary LLOYD AUSTIN, “can win.”",False,1652732894.0,t3_uqumkk,t1_i8v35bt,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The siege of Kobanî was launched by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on 13 September 2014, in order to capture the Kobanî Canton and its main city of Kobanî (also known as Kobanê or Ayn al-Arab) in northern Syria, in the de facto autonomous region of Rojava. By 2 October 2014, the Islamic State succeeded in capturing 350 Kurdish villages and towns in the vicinity of Kobanê, generating a wave of some 300,000 Kurdish refugees, who fled across the border into Turkey's Şanlıurfa Province. By January 2015, this had risen to 400,000.

The prompt for the decision decades after the trans-Atlantic security alliance was formed is obvious. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year was a reminder to Finland that its eastern neighbor could not be trusted to respect their shared border. Not that Finland necessarily needed such a reminder; the then-Soviet Union invaded Finland about 80 years ago. But that was before Russia had nuclear weapons that it has repeatedly expressed a willingness to use.  


So what does this mean? How does the probable addition of Finland — and the likely subsequent addition of Sweden — reshape the power balance between Russia and NATO? It’s likely that the alliance itself won’t change much, but the tension between NATO and its geopolitical opponent might.

The most important issue is the Finland-Russia border itself. The expansion of NATO over time has been toward Russia’s western edge, with the collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago prompting a number of former Soviet states and Warsaw Pact countries to seek and gain membership in the alliance. On the map below (illustrated as though one was looking down at the North Pole), you can see how NATO expanded toward Russia. You can also see why Ukraine explored NATO membership for so long.  


Some of Russia’s defenses of its incursion into Ukraine suggest that it was out of concern about having NATO on its border; a shoddy defense given that Russia already shared a border both with former Soviet states Estonia and Latvia and with a remote part of Norway. The addition of Finland, however, would extend the shared NATO-Russia boundary from about 440 miles to more than 1,200.  


This doesn’t inherently make war more likely, but Finland’s shift to the West is the sort of change that Russia’s been hoping to prevent. In a statement, Russia’s government pledged to “take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, to stop the threats to its national security that arise in this regard.”  


What NATO offers Finland is clear: security from its aggressive eastern neighbor. Curious what the addition of Finland and Sweden adds to NATO, I pulled data to see.  


NATO is not contiguous, so land area is not a particularly useful metric, but aggregating the size of NATO countries relative to Russia is instructive. Russia is huge. With Finland and Sweden, the size of NATO countries is only 1.4 times the size of Russia in its entirety.  


But much of Russia is unpopulated. The NATO countries have about six-and-a-half times the population of Russia. The addition of Finland and Sweden, however, wouldn’t change that much.  


Where things get skewed quickly is on economics. The current countries of NATO had a 2020 gross domestic product equivalent to 27 times that of Russia — largely a function of the United States. Adding Finland and Sweden increases that to 27.6 times Russia’s GDP.  


And then there’s military spending. One of the requirements of NATO membership is that nations spend a certain percentage of GDP on their military. (This was the metric that former president Donald Trump made a focus of his criticisms of NATO.) The current members of NATO spend about 24.5 times as much on their militaries as does Russia. (Iceland is an exception; it does not have a military but is a NATO member given its strategic location.)  


Much of that spending is on material and technology. When considering the size of the standing military for each country, the ratio is smaller. NATO has about 3.2 times as many members of its collective militaries as does Russia — or as Russia did before its fumbling incursion into Ukraine.  


Include military reserves and the margin narrows further: NATO has 1.7 times the military as Russia. But if we include Finland and Sweden here, the scale doubles. Finland, it turns out, has a massive military reserve.  


Why? Largely because it shares that extensive border with Russia. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and began engaging in military conflict in eastern Ukraine, Finland sent out renewed instructions to its large force of reservists. Again, Finland has a history of suffering from aggression from its east.

So the thing is, we have seen a few times where’s there’s been large piles of Russian bodies where a squad or platoon got wiped out. It’s not rare, but it’s not common. I follow this war for hours a day and I don’t see that even weekly. It’s like twice a month that I’ve been seeing something like that. 

And when we see 20 vehicles ruined they are often just abandoned. And attacking dug in INF with Arty isn’t easy. Trenches are really good and used still for a reason. If you notice large groups of dead are always on the attack bunched up or in urban combat. Most of the front isn’t urban and a lot do these attacks are also showing even more abandoned vehicles (which is a daily thing). 

So my point is, that’s not enough real data to prove anything, but to me it does seem to suggest a pattern that RU forces aren’t taking these massive losses like most think. I will also add, I do think RU got clapped harder the first month vs now.

""Napoleon changed artillery - an often quoted sentiment is that of Wellington at Waterloo - ""He is moving his guns around like they were a pair of pistols!"" Sweden had invented light field artillery but Napoleon brought its usage to a new level. Napoleon, who was above all an artillery officer, owed his first successes to this weapon. It was thanks to the talents of his gunners that he took Toulon in 1793 and that he began to make a name. It was with cannons that he faced the Royalist revolt against the Directory and gained the nickname ""General Vendémiaire"". Once in power, Napoleon was therefore the most able to know how to intelligently reform this weapon from which he is born and which he knows perfectly well, having held all the posts, from simple gunner (as part of his training at the military School of Paris) to general. In 1803, when Napoleon became the first Consul, he decided to simplify the Gribeauval system further by limiting the number of calibers used. The goal is simple, always more standardize to always improve repairs and supply.

In the days when cannons could out-range the short fire of muskets, Napoleon would mass his highly mobile artillery forward of his lines of infantry, and with relative impunity from enemy small arms, batter the opposing line with direct fire. At the right moment he would pass his infantry through his guns and carry the position with the bayonet. The French emperor depended heavily on his artillery. His battles opened with the sound of gums from the divisions, soon followed by those of the corps. Before he launched his main attack, the greater part of his army artillery reserve would rush to the front. An intensive bombardment would pulverize the opposing line at the point of assault. If fortune handed Napoleon the right to pursue a broken enemy, his horse artillery supported the cavalry. If fate withheld its favor, then artillerymen delayed to cover the army's withdrawal.

The importance of field gun on the Napoleonic battlefield was a derivative of their range advantage over infantry muskets. Napoleon heightened the advantage by an aggressively mobile exploitation of his artillery arm. Canister fire was most deadly against exposed infantry. Gunners could use canister at ranges as great as 600 meters; however, its effectiveness increased as the distance diminished. In contrast, at ranges beyond 250 meters the infantry musket was nearly useless. Unless an ungallant enemy hid himself, gunners preferred low trajectory fire.""

the us could have offered a bilateral deal to ukraine, but it *chose* not to do so. such a deal would have been expensive and would have required american bases in ukraine as it would not have been able to guarantee the use of nato airbases in the event of a war. this would have deterred russian aggression because the russians have no desire to go to war with the united states, but also it would also have 1. made it harder to reform ukrainian institutions and 2. given russia the ability to drive a wedge between the us and its allies by economically retaliating against european members of nato. neither of these are obstacles in the case of the nordic countries.

the us nuclear umbrella has been ample in deterring russian aggression for decades, even in years when nato itself did not believe it could defeat the soviet union in a conventional conflict. nato membership is the ideal but not necessary to achieve the narrow goal of deterring russian military attacks on finland/sweden, and finland/sweden are enough of a core american security interest that we would not have trouble marshalling support for trilateral agreement in congress.",1652728612.0,1652728216.0,t3_uqumkk,t1_i8uq2bp,,5,2,0,2,0,0,

Also, keep in mind that 14 years ago Ukraine itself was only recently out of the influence of some pretty nasty pro-Russian leaders (which is why Russia invaded).

I get what you are saying, but sometimes a simple vote in a population that has been brainwashed and severely traumatised is not a good idea.

People who’ve been forced out of Crimea should be given the chance to move back. Crimeans should be given the opportunity to live in a free country and recover from the shit that comes from being in a authoritarian regime.",False,1652768235.0,t3_uqumkk,t1_i8wtqpj,,7,1,0,1,0,0,

The river crossing will be picked apart later. I suspect it will be an example of how not to do a river crossing. The Ukrainian accounts seem to suggest that Russia did not come close to normal tactics for this type of operation.

NATO initially said 10K serbian troops got killed during airstrikes; then 5000; and well after the war, 1200. 

It's just how these things work. Morale is one of *the* most important resources in a war, and higher counts will help with that.

That river crossing is just another example of how confusing this is. It seems that they did suffer like 90% casualties. However while that isn’t the first time that’s happened, I do not believe that it is the norm for most engagements. Which is part of why it’s such a big deal in the news. Other river crossings have been stopped, others have worked. That one is in the news because it’s just so spectacular. 

It was also very awesome news for Ukraine! 

But long story short, the main point that the threads in that I’m trying to state is that there’s a very good chance the casualty numbers are being overstated, but really there is no way to tell. Hell we could all be wrong and you could be even higher than Ukraine seeing. We could be significantly lower. Nobody actually knows and we really don’t have actual data for the most part on this. We are making guesses based on what we think the Russians started with, which are also guesses. It’s not as simple as counting bodies either like most people think. And when we do get actual data points like these documents, they are few and far between and are just one small part of the picture. You have to think about all these different factors.
