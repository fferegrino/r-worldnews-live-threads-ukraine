> What happens around Mariupol in the next few days should reveal alot about the state of the Russian Army--in a ghastly way. The 'demand' that the city be surrendered was really a plea. Saying to the Ukrainians, 'we really dont want to send our army into the town.'
> 
> This Ukrainian rejection will force the Russians to do the one thing they have so far been very reluctant to do in this campaign--go into a defended city. This is precisely because by their own actions, they have allowed the Ukrainians time to prepare.
> 
> The Russians have so far continued what they have been doing, long-distance bombardment. But that doesn't help them much at this point as they've already blown up most of the city.
> 
> Indeed, they seem to have created a perfect environment for defenders to draw them into street by street fighting.
> 
> And the Russians have put relatively little effort into such a fight--and at the same time their troops have been in the field now for more than 3 weeks, and are undoubtedly suffering from strain and loss of morale.
> 
> So if the Ukrainians do continue to hold the centre, the Russian army will have to go in, and reveal a lot about its training, morale and ability to continue this war.
> 
> Btw, if the Russians don’t send their army into Mariupol in the next few days, it’s because they really don’t believe it’s up to the task. They certainly don’t care about slaughtering more civilians; as that has become one of their core tactics.

>UNITED NATIONS (AP) — France and Mexico are pressing U.N. members to mention Russia's invasion in a resolution on the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine. But South Africa is arguing against that approach, saying that inserting political issues may block consensus on helping civilians.

>The General Assembly is expected to meet and vote Wednesday on the French-Mexican resolution at Ukraine’s request, assembly spokesperson Paulina Kubiak said Monday night.Unlike the Security Council, there are no vetoes in the General Assembly.

And some of them make amazing covers for their releases. For Russia, ""Novaya Gazeta"" (New magazine if translated literally) is something like Charlie Hebdo for France (If I understand the value of Charlie right).

> 
> BY JOSHUA POSANER
> March 22, 2022 8:17 pm
> 
> Readers of POLITICO have selected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the most powerful person in Europe.
> 
> The “Audience Choice” online poll is aimed at updating the annual POLITICO 28 list of the most powerful people that was published in December. The list, which predicts who will be making the political weather and taking the big decisions in Europe this year, was a result of months of debate amongst the 100-strong editorial team.
> 
> In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the profound geopolitical and economic shifts that have followed, POLITICO invited readers to vote on changes to the list.
> 
> One contributor to the Audience Choice survey, which was launched in early March, described Zelenskyy as “a beacon of hope” who was striving for “peace, democracy, decency” as Ukraine struggles to resist an invasion by Russian forces.
> 
> Since the fighting started in the early hours of February 24, Zelenskyy has posted regular video updates on social media, including posts of him in downtown Kyiv and at work in his presidential office complex.
> 
> He has also delivered powerful video speeches to the U.S. Congress, U.K. parliament and German Bundestag among others, tailoring each appearance to hammer home a central message: that Ukraine needs more support from the West in its fight against Russia.
> 
> Critically, his messaging has helped change the nature of debate within European capitals, forcing the kind of U-turns in government policy that were unthinkable just a few months ago.
> 
> For example, Germany suspended the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline just ahead of the invasion and broke a long-standing taboo on sending weapons to conflict zones, while also pledging to boost defense spending. Elsewhere, countries recently critical of Europe’s migration policy, such as Poland and Hungary, have opened their borders to millions of refugees fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.
> 
> In the POLITICO 28 poll, readers also said Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock should have made the original list. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron, Putin and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen were touted as the most popular alternatives for the overall most powerful position.

> A woman who fled the besieged city of Mariupol has described how children have died of dehydration and others are starving to death after Russian troops cut off water and food supplies more than three weeks ago. 
> 
> Victoria, who only gave her first name, told the BBC that three infants she knows have died because they could not access drinking water, after the snow they had been melting for supplies ran out.
> 
> Others are now starving in basements that have been turned into makeshift bomb shelters but are being slowly destroyed by Russian artillery that pounds the city non-stop 'except a few hours at night', Victoria added.
> 
> Russia is thought to be concentrating its firepower on Mariupol in an attempt to capture at least one target of value after its offensive stalled elsewhere with heavy losses.

> 
> There are some key rules that will help you save your life if you become a prisoner.

> **Rest**
> 
> First of all, try to behave calmly:
> 
> * do not show the occupiers that you are afraid;
> * do not resist;
> * do not try to talk to them;
> * do not ask for pity or discouragement from their plan;
> * do not provoke aggravation of the situation: do not violate the established rules.
> 
> **Psychological attitude**
> 
> Try to calm yourself down and adjust psychologically to the fact that you will not be released from captivity immediately. 
> 
> **Contact with the occupiers**
> 
> Don't look terrorists straight in the eye. Look a little to the side. At the same time, do not pretend to be humiliated, because such signals provoke aggression.

For those who are nervous about whatever Russia just announced, here is a timeline of things that were going to immediately win the war for Russia: 

Day one: dominant military and air superiority. It's over as soon as they airdrop into Kyiv. 

Day two: Chernobyl has high levels of radiation again.  Is Ukraine willing to have another disaster? 

Day three: Chechen Muslims! They're going to rape and pillage their way through Kyiv until everyone surrenders. 

Days four: Russian strategy is to send in their worst equipment and troops first. Now that they've failed, the *real* war will start. Ukraine is doomed. 

Day five: there are two assassin groups looking for Zelenskyy, including another group of Chechens. Oh no! 

Day six: Russia upped their nuclear preparation level. Are they going to use a nuke if Ukraine doesn't submit? 

Day seven: Thermobaric bombs will immediately destroy the Ukrainian military. 

Day eight: Belarusian special forces are on the way. Spooky. 

Day nine: Shelling civilian buildings will make Ukraine surrender. 

Day ten: The Wagner group that got absolutely obliterated by a small SF team in Syria is here. Doom. 

Day eleven: Syrian special forces, who barely beat ISIS despite the huge Syrian army, total Russian support, and US aerial and recon support. 

Day twelve: Russia threatens to cut off gas to Europe and punish nations with volunteers in Ukraine. Will they stop supporting Ukraine? 

Day thirteen: COOOOOONVOYYYY! 

Day fourteen: Syrian regular soldiers. ^^they're ^^Muslims
Not sure what happened to their special forces. 

Day fifteen: Russia says Ukraine has chemical weapons and Russia will stop at nothing to prevent a chemical attack. 

Day sixteen: Russia is recruiting even more fighters from the Middle East. Different guys than the last two threats apparently. They cannot stress strongly enough how scary Muslims are. 

Day seventeen: another Chechen commander is releasing videos in Ukraine, scarier than the earlier Chechen final bosses. Why do all these guys look like Mose Schrute? 

Day eighteen: Russia is attacking cities and barracks in the west. All the foreign volunteers will flee! 

Day nineteen: *angry radio signals* Russia is sending strategic bombers. 

Day twenty: (Black Sea) COOOOOONVOYYYY headed towards Odessa. TBF, they do tend to get stuck in the mud and in traffic less, but they are large and slow-moving targets. 

Day twenty-one: Russia sent four warships not through the shared sea border in the Black Sea where they could be used immediately, but starting in the Pacific Ocean and going either through the Horn of Africa, Suez Canal, and the Straight of Istanbul or through the arctic, Straight of Gibralter, Mediterranean Sea, and Straight of Istanbul, either of which route requiring them to get Turkey's permission and eventually taking them to the Black Sea. This plea for attention will slow down supplies by a few weeks but shows that RUSSIA WILL STOP AT NOTHING. 

Day twenty-two: three guys from the Tennessee national guard were found in Ukraine, dead or maybe actually alive and still fighting, we're not sure. Is NATO going to be pulled in and start WWIII because of foreign volunteers? Better stop allowing them! 

Day twenty-three: Russia is sending their generals to the frontlines. Putin just spoke to a loud group. Russia is revitalized and starting *right now* will take the war seriously. 

Day twenty-four: Russia says it used hypersonic missiles in Ukraine for first time. Russia actively mobilizes male population 

Day twenty-five: Russia sanctions President Biden's father and Hillary Clinton, shows Tucker and Cawthorn on state TV, and talks about biolabs. Marjorie Trailer Greene rants unintelligibly. Q has been activated. The American right suddenly remembers Russia is the victim. The dumbest person you know wants you to do your own research but not via academic studies, journalism, or history.

Britain is concerned that France and Germany will offer President Putin an “easy off-ramp” as they push for further peace talks with Russia.

Ministers have become increasingly concerned about bilateral discussions between President Macron and Putin.

Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, warned at the weekend that peace talks were a “smokescreen” for Putin while his forces commit further “appalling atrocities”. She is concerned that there will be a repeat of the Minsk agreement in 2014 after Russia’s invasion of Crimea, when Germany and France played a leading role in talks.

A government source said: “Any negotiations with Russia should come from a position of utmost strength. The G7 needs to stay united. There should be no easy off-ramp for Putin. We shouldn’t be in the business of making early concessions. We need to be tough to get peace.”

On Thursday Boris Johnson will head to a Nato summit in Brussels, which will also be attended by President Biden.

The prime minister is said to believe that negotiations should be between Russia and Ukraine directly.

“There’s no easy way out of this,” another government source said. “Ukraine has to be involved in these conversations. You can’t be a third party in that. We need to be very careful to put Ukraine’s interests first.” Russia yesterday said progress in peace talks had stalled. President Zelensky called on Germany to intensify sanctions on Russia. In a video addressing the German people, he said: “We warned your politicians that this is dangerous when Moscow decides what natural gas you get and at what price. We said sanctions were needed to prevent this war. Please don’t sponsor the war machine of this country, Russia.

a6eabe054086acb2122a1ec1bdfd6e38,tjueug,i1nv0j1,"Made this post yesterday about makariv and northwest kyiv, will repost as it's now relevant.

Makariv is liberated. If you weren't following the locations here, this is about 30k west of Irpin. Part of the 40 mile convoy was along this road, and many of those failed bridge crossing attempts happened to the north of this road between Stroyanka (along this road) and Iprin to the north. Units from the convoy dispersed into the treelines in this area as well. This is quite a major victory, as this is the furthest west the invaders have been pushed since the first few days. This was the group that entered through Belarus.

Yesterday it was reported they were unsure if there were troops south of highway from the attempt to circle south. Seems like there were a few as there are hotspots south of highway, but seem to be dealt with. 

Seems the counteroffensive is faring quite well in the north. The rest of the units in this area are between this road and the highway to the north from what I can tell. The area is farm and woodlands, and this is where Russia has dug in a bit. Many many hotspots in this area, even in last 24 hours. Some of this could be farms and grass burning, but undoubtedly Russian forces have taken fire as far back as the wood southeast of Borodyanka. 

Judging by the hotspots, the fighting has moved 20-30k away from Kyiv now and a very clear front has emerged, likely from UA artillery. These troops have faced some of the worst logistical issues as well, so their capacity to return fire may be somewhat limited. 

The hotspots on firms can also result from grass fires ignited by GRADs, but I suspect grad supply is limited for Russia in this area. 

There are signs of fighting in Iprin still, but they are much smaller pockets. And they are further from Kyiv than a week ago. The fighting will likely move into the area between Borodyanka and Makariv now, as there are still Russian troops there. The fighting around hostemel airport has stopped, with only sign of activity in the woods to the north. The original maxar pictures were along the airport ring road and surrounding area. These places came under heavy attack, after which they dispersed into the countryside.

The northwest attack has been... I don't want to say repulsed.... but significantly reduced, and it is now ua forces making gains with Russia on defence. Much less going on in the northeast of Kyiv, with some shelling of russian troops. Ukraines forces seem to have stopped that advance for now, but the main counter offensive is on the northwest. 

Seems Russian control is a bit more staggered to the northeast as well, with fighting happening well into ""Russia controlled"" territory. 

With supplies being particularly difficult for Russia around Kyiv, it seems a matter of time before ua pushes the northwest front further back and liberates some of the smaller towns on the western outskirts. If they are successful, they will push the western artillery out of range of the Kyiv city center.

Edit: Spelling

Edit2: I would not be surprised if UA focuses on Borodyanka (north of Makariv) in the coming days even over Irpin. If some maps are to be believed, if ua forces push North from Makariv and east from the ua territory around borodyanka, the Russian forces between borodyanka and Iprin could be effectively encircled. There are significant hotspots in Borodyanka in last 12 hours, and seems area has been hit be shells or rockets. If this is retaken, Russian forces arrayed between iprin and borodyanka would be cut off from behind. There only way out would either remaining forces recapturing borodyanka, or to the North where the second part of the force lies near dymer. This could prove difficult though as topographically the North seems easier to isolate, and few routes. The quick advance left them very vulnerable to the head being pinched off from supporting forces.

How could a handful stole a whole country for their own benefit, which no consequences, is beyond my comprehension. Because Russia has been reduced to nothing by Putin’s cronies, Modern Russia without the West doesn’t even exist today.

They can’t repair or build new tanks because they lack sparing parts which came from outside (reportedly). They can’t repair their planes. They lack economic plans sponsored by the state to replace the West corporations and give millions of people a place to work. The inflation will skyrocket a hundreds times in a year if the rupture continues like this. The ruble will become practically worthless and no corporation will come back if Russia commits economic suicide by nationalizing foreign businesses.

But to be frank, I don’t care about them, because Ukraine doesn’t have 2 months, or a years for the sanctions to end the war. Their economic collapse is too small of a price for the atrocities that NOW are being committed in Ukraine. They deserved the worst that’s coming to them.

There are now millions of Ukrainian refugees in the world who will have daily reminders of 'how fantastic' Russian culture is reflected in other nations where they are taking shelter. 

There are no innocent Russians who 'did nothing' to bring this about. Cultures are built over time. Russia is repeating behavior that has existed for centuries. Nothing here is new, nothing is something that 'nobody could see coming.' People who are unwilling to allow Russian issues to be a lower priority than Ukrainian issues are exhibiting a level of ignorance of cultural responsibility that is insensitive and irresponsible when done freelance but dangerous and harmful when done with motivation.

There are Russian citizens without the capacity to fight back against an oppressive government and an entitled culture, and they are causalities in the economic and cultural war that will follow their nation's physical genocide of other people. I can have empathy for them without saying, ""You're right, Russia's fine, it's just Putin.""

If you can't see through Ukrainian eyes at the moment and can only see with the eyes of a historian or a detached person, you're not what is needed. This isn't history, this is happening in real time. Speaking and acting against evil now is something everyone has to do in order to be identified as friend or foe.

If you've sided with ""but Russia has a point..."" you're evil or so far inside your own personal issues that you can't see or be part of a wider world effectively. You're going to be a casualty or callously do harm to already-traumatized people by trying to show Ukrainians how Russian culture is glorious and people all over the world are just people getting by.

Consider: In 2014 he invaded Crimea.  The downside is that Ukraine cut off Crimea's water supply and it was super expensive to replace it.  Additionally sanctions on Russia were annoying, like an annoying mosquito bite you can't reach.   The solution was to annex the rest of Ukraine.  Lots of positives here: water, lots of unexplored oil and gas reserves, people, good start to soviet union 2.0, fantastic strategic value against NATO.  But to do it Putin had to muzzle the west.  

So -- the master plan...

In the US he steps up propaganda campaigns meant to wedge a heretofore little noticed split between rural and urban Americans.  He supported a presidential candidate that he could compromise -- and to everyone's surprise -- trump won.   Trump worked endlessly to remove the sanctions -- some he did, some he couldn't.  Trump also worked to dismantle NATO.  (And as an aside, our pacific alliances).

Just for funnies, he threw in a little migration crisis on the southern border by using propaganda used to fuel latin immigration to the US, while simultaneously stepping up resentment against immigrants in the US.  In the EU, he also tried to stoke an immigration crisis, but this was largely thwarted.

Oh yea, he also gutted the state department.  The department which would be first to organize the world's responsible to any russian activities.

In Europe, putin pushed brexit to hobble the EU and get it to focus on their own survival instead of anything that might happen on their border. 

If trump had won a second term, likely even with the Ukrainians fighting just as bravely Putin could have secured a win.  The west would have been too disorganized to mount a response with the civilian and military aid.

But trump didn't win.  Putin misjudged how quickly the west would bounce back from his destabilization campaign.  He was also misinformed by his intelligence and military advisors as to the ease of victory and the capabilities of the Ukrainians.

And so here we are.  It all came down to ""trump didn't win"".  If putin had good info and factored that into his plan, we wouldn't be here today.  But putin kept pushing forward on his overarching grand plan that had been almost a decade in the making, the culmination of his leadership of russia.

And face planted in Ukraine.

It was a smart and sly and cunning plan, just as you said.  And then stupid. All because he didn't adapt his plan when trump didn't win.",1647954443.0,1647954159.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1mp4y4,,1,6,0,6,0,0,

So his plan was probably great if his advisors lies were true. Send a bunch of guys in, flex a little and easily take the major cities. Get whatever he wanted. Hell if half the lies were true his plan still would have worked. Busted military but receptive ukrainians or unstoppable military and angry ukraniens. Instead he got a busted military and angry Ukrainians.

Furthermore, your Russian wealth has two major problems:  1- it’s in Rubles and is therefore volatile, and 2- it’s probably highly illegitimate in nature and is tied to the Putin regime in some way (you didn’t become a billionaire without Putin getting his claws in you.)

So you really want to get your Russian wealth into the West, and you want illiquid assets- real estate in London, various types of financial instruments, that sort of thing.  But real estate is also problematic, because it’s just in one place and can be sanctioned or seized.  Financial assets aren’t physical, but they’re just as prone to seizure.

So yachts end up being a great way to consolidate your wealth outside of the Russian economy: it’s portable, insanely valuable, and you can always find a friendly port (with some cash in hand).  You can also load it up with physical wealth, IE make doorknobs out of gold and shit like that.

So the megayacht becomes a really attractive way to move illicit gains not only out of the country, but to also (hopefully) keep said gains out of the hands of the authorities.

Obviously the strength of the Western response was surprising to everyone.  In the case of the yachts, the oligarchs relied on keeping them in friendly waters, but many of those waters turned out to be friendly as long as certain people did not become extremely pissed off and motivated.  Those people are now extremely pissed off and motivated, and the oligarchs often can’t respond quickly enough to avoid interdiction.",False,1647979086.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1p5f2o,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

He estimates that there is currently:  
2x armored battalion groups around Motyzhyn (Standard size: 300-1000 each)  
2x mechanized infantry battalions around Buzova (300-1000 each)  
4x airborne infantry battalion spread out between Khmilna and Hostomel (300-1000 each)  
The cut-off at Moschun would have pushed back the naval infantry brigade (2.000-20.000)

So 8 surrounded battalions is between 2.400 and 8.000 troops.

>If they can push them back from Kyiv and get some breathing room they can start to deploy more forces to the south

The distance between Kyiv and, let's say, Mariupol is the same as the distance from Detroit to Annapolis, Maryland. In WW2, we still laud Patton's Third Army for breaking contact with an enemy force that they were engaged with during the Battle of the Bulge, wheeling 90 degrees, and moving 30+ miles in poor weather to relieve the encircled 101st Airborne besieged in Bastogne. This was considered a true military accomplishment that is still held up and studied today... and that was 30 miles (analogous to the Ukrainian force moving from NW Kyiv to SE Kyiv to meet another threat/relieve a Ukrainian force there) 

Mariupol is 400 miles from the front NW of Kyiv. Other, closer, key areas in the South are still 100-200+ miles from Kyiv. Ukrainian troops committed to the fight around Kyiv will undoubtedly remain committed in that AO for the foreseeable future.

Edit: The explanation for the word ""motti"" in the English wiki-link is a bit misleading. It has nothing to do with cup or whatever (in that context) and does not mean entrapment or anything such really. (It means roughly ""measurement"" if you want to go to the root of the word.) But really a motti is a small stack of logs placed in the woods. While gathering wood you cant carry all of it with you so you stack it in mottis (piles) somewhat evenly spaced. So that you can go back and pick what you gathered later.

That is also part of what makes a motti special, it is not a basic starvation or siege tactic. The tactic is that you really form such an entrapment that the enemy forces can't get anywhere and you can take all the time you need and pick them off later. It is also impled that there are more than one, like a net of them over a large area. I would not call any single encirclement a ""motti"". It has to be multiples. There are somewhat morbid stories of finnish soldiers killing Russians stuck in a motti, getting bored and going home to have a sauna and some food, then going back again to kill a few more, then home to sleep, back up in the morning and starting over again. And so on.

Prepared defences are very difficult to take as the defender will have prepared the area for overlapping lines of fire and mutual defence.

There is fighting to the East in the remaining parts of Luhansk that is still controlled by Ukraine and to the North in Kharkiv oblast where Russia is trying to consolidate their push on Izium. Furthermore, Russia is heavily invested in clearing Mariupol house by house.

Most experts (with a couple of hours of HOI4 under their belts) assumed that Russia would seek to envelop and destroy the best elements of the Ukrainian army in Donbas in the first few days of this war. However, it appears that eight years of war has not been wasted by the Ukrainian Army who have been able to hold onto their positions in the East despite many commentators believing that this strategy would be a mistake.

We are still only three weeks into this war but Ukraine has more than surpassed expectations in their tenacity and ability in defence. The news that the so called People's Republics were calling up men to the age of 65 both shows how bloody the fighting is for Russia in the region and how Russian doctrine depends heavily on cannon fodder.

Typically the stuff that’s harder to make domestically is the computers/electronics to run the whole thing.

I believe most advanced chip production is now cut off from Russia and they were likely very short before sanctions even started because the whole world has been short.

Sure - some can aspire to be self sufficient if absolutely necessary (such as the US), but most depend on raw resources or finished products for a significant % of their needs.

Let's say sanctions continue for 5 more years - it's feasible Russia could start producing some replacements for the components it needs, but they would be lower quality, less precise or altogether different systems. I mean - the USSR was more or less self sufficient - but it was a much smaller economy and almost everything it produced was of lower quality. It was very much a philosophy of numbers over quality. Even now most of their ""top"" weapon systems (tanks/planes etc) are just for show, a few models built for demo purposes of what they COULD build if they had the funds and the expertise. The bulk is still 80-90s gear.

&#x200B;

And then you have the ""problem"" of just-in-time production, which is wonderful when trade flows freely and supply meets demand when and where necessary, but not so much when sanctions strangle supply.  This means that there are no big stockpiles of raw materials or parts waiting to be used - everything is delivered just as it's needed for production (as a simplified view - tank tracks arrive at the plant the same day/week as they are needed to be mounted on a tank, they don't arrive weeks in advance and wait in a warehouse).

Men holding a Ph.D., as well as sons and brothers of servicemen killed or disabled during their military service, are released from conscription.  
>  
>***Thirty percent of Russian Armed Forces' personnel were contract servicemen at the end of 2005.\[18\] For the foreseeable future, the Armed Forces will be a mixed contract/conscript force.\[18***\] The Russian Armed Forces need to maintain a mobilization reserve to have manning resources capable of reinforcing the permanent readiness forces if the permanent readiness forces cannot deter or suppress an armed conflict on their own.\[50\]

First, they already had massive supply issues with their current force, they've never mobilized this much of their military and they definitely couldn't supply more.

Second, this is actually 75% of Russia's professional military. It's technically illegal for Russia to send in conscripts (they've done so anyway, mind, but not widespread).

A lot of them are support roles such as logistics, medical, communications, artillery, occupation etc. Then there are varying levels of experience and morale.  

Secondly, it's also important to note that when we consider Russia's losses - The majority are going to be direct conflict troops that have been engaging with Ukrainian forces which significantly weakens the combat efficiency of a force. The other major loss has been logistics columns trying to get supplies to troops. It's great having 40-50k support troops, but without supplies, they're useless.

This is why the main focus on the campaign for Ukraine up until the last few days has been basically hit and run tactics with the exception of major cities.  The Ukrainian forces haven't been trying to hold a line, but instead attack and disperse, with a focus on forcing invaders to prepared choke points, off road to unfavorable terrain and ambushing logistics. This is important because it significantly increases the advantage of Ukrainian forces. Now a group of 20 soldiers with 10 anti-tank weapons can take out an entire logistics column and prevent a battlegroup from being resupplied for a few extra days. 

Finally, the reason Putin didn't prepare a larger force? Nobody knows yet. There are multiple theories and rumours, but I wouldn't read into them until action has been taken to support them. The US intelligence strategy of airing their findings and knowledge within a few hours/days of discovery has been really effective at preventing Russia from gaining any advantage in terms of propaganda.

>Occupant surrendered a tank to Ukrainian fighters for a reward.  
A few days ago we received a phone call from ""Misha"". We passed the information about him to the Ministry of Defense. He drove up. From the drone we verified that he was alone and it was not an ambush. After that, the special forces detained him.  
He was the only one left of the tank crew, the rest fled home. He could not go home because the commander said he would shoot him and would write it off as combat casualty. Misha told us that there was practically no food left, the management of troops was chaotic and almost non-existent. Demoralization was colossal.  
Now Misha has been given comfortable conditions of detention. He will also receive $10,000 at the end of the war and an opportunity to apply for citizenship.""

Apparently it wasn't really a 40km convoy. Its 15 btgs spread out over 40kms. It was held up mostly because the front of the convoy kept being hit in raids and every bridge between kyiv and the russians forward operating base had been blown. So they kept having to wait for engineers to set up bridges. Well now it seems that its gotten close enough to kyiv to disperse and join that fight. Doesn't seem to have helped russian forces encircle the city.  Potentially some of them have also gone to  Chernihiv to try and suppress thst city. Also to set up bridges to cross a river near chernihiv which would allow russian forces  a potentially better supply route to encircled kyiv since UKR keeps turning supply convoys  east of kyiv into dog shit.,1647935489.0,1647934803.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1mtjko,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

He doesn't believe in MAD and never has, he believes in NUTS and thinks the West is weak enough that NATO will fall apart. He knows the West would have the choice between defending Poland militarily and it escalating into nukes once Russia is losing horribly, or abandoning Poland to avoid that, and believes we'd pick the latter. Invading a nuclear power would be suicidal, but he has doubts about the willingness to get involved when he invades non nuclear powers or even uses tactical nukes himself. His stance is that everyone else will choose to deescalate at all costs when sufficiently threatened, that's why his war strategy in general is ""escalate to deescalate"". So that's his reasoning, and for his incentives, listen to his speeches, he spells it all out very clearly. A combination of nostalgia, ego, a chip on his shoulder and mysticism. For his game plan and rationale, see ""Foundations of geopolitics"" by Dugin.

As for whether this is still his belief, that's uncertain. So far, NATO has stepped up to the plate massively even in this situation involved a non member, since having Russia behave as a terrorist state is so detrimental to their interests. It's well below the bar Putin expected. His escalations and threats have also not resulted in any backing down so far. He may be forced by reality to revise his belief, but the extra problem is that even if he stops believing he can get away with this, let alone with invading Poland, he has painted himself into a corner.

If he loses/can no longer afford the war (inevitable, since they cannot possibly hope to occupy the country, they don't have the manpower or the cooperation of the people) he's screwed. Russia is going to suffer so much from retributive actions including sanctions that he'll become even more of a target for a coup or assassination than he is today, regardless of whether he can fabricate a win out of it in order to leave (e.g. ""we succeeded in killing the Nazis which totally existed in the first place so we're going home""). Then you have a paranoid megalomaniac who is in constant imminent danger worse than he's ever experienced, who can never leave Russia again, his family in the same dangers due to their value as hostages or targets, much of his wealth inaccessible, the laughing stock of and detested by the world and even much of his own population, his legacy and dreams of USSR revival in tatters, unpleasant death looming fast.

0ebf2197053eebdb0fdbc647b1b9553d,tjueug,i1mk0lm,I don’t think many are saying Ukraine is destroying Russia. What has happened is Russia is bogged down militarily. They’re not making a significant push on Kiev and even when they do take a smaller city they have to leave troops behind so it spreads them thinner. They’re bombing the fuck out of the cities but this fundamentally doesn’t change the landscape from a military point of view. Go look at pictures of Stalingrad. It was demolished but Germany still lost that battle because the only way to win is to kill their soldiers and limit their ability to make war and/or defend themselves. Russia from this perspective hasn’t fundamentally changed the game. They’d need to take Kiev or at least Odessa. They still don’t even have Mariupol and they’ve bombed the crap out of it. It’s a city of 430K pre war. Kiev had 3M or 8x the size. Personally it’s doubtful Russia can ever take Kiev without committing many more troops which leaves them vulnerable on other fronts. They’re kind of in this awkward place where they can’t move forward and can’t move back so they just she’ll civilians day after day. That’s not winning but it’s not like Ukraine is winning. But by not losing Ukraine is essentially winning the long play. Least that’s my take trying to ascertain what I can.,False,1647925242.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1miqiq,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Putin has, at this point, committed the bulk of his military to this operation: there are no vast reserves of forces he can call up to add to the battle. His troops have been stuck outside various Ukrainian cities where they face supply problems and constant attack. All this is a good lesson for China which, like Russia, has built up seemingly high-tech military forces in the past decade but they have no combat experience. 

The miserable performance of the Russian air force would likely be replicated by the People’s Liberation Army air force, which has no experience managing complex air operations. We may hope that the Chinese leadership won’t delude itself as to its capabilities the way the Russians did when contemplating a move against Taiwan. 

So let’s not be prematurely defeatist. A Russian defeat will make possible a ‘new birth of freedom’, and get us out of our funk about the declining state of global democracy. The spirit of 1989 will live on, thanks to those brave Ukrainians. I look forward to a time when I can return to a peaceful Ukraine and resume the slow, boring work of fortifying democracy.

> Окупанти насильно змушують людей виїжджати з України на територію росії
> 
> За останній тиждень кілька тисяч маріупольців було вивезено на територію росії. Окупанти незаконно вивозили людей із Лівобережного району та сховища у будівлі спорт-клубу, де від постійних бомбардувань ховалося понад тисячі людей (переважно жінки та діти). У цих районах точилися бойові дії. Для збереження життів маріупольців Збройні сили України відійшли від місць масового скупчення людей, чим і скористалася сторона агресора.
> 
> Відомо, що захоплених маріупольців вивозили до фільтраційних таборів, де окупанти перевіряли телефони та документи людей. Після перевірки частину маріупольців перенаправляли до віддалених міст росії, доля інших залишається невідомою.
> 
> «Те, що сьогодні роблять окупанти – знайоме старшому поколінню, яке застало жахливі події Другої світової війни, коли нацисти насильно захоплювали людей. Складно уявити, щоб у 21 столітті людей насильно вивозили в іншу країну. Мало того, що російські війська знищують наш мирний Маріуполь, вони пішли ще далі і почали вивозити маріупольців. Всі військові злочини з боку росії мають отримати найжорсткіше покарання», - міський голова Маріуполя Вадим Бойченко.

> The occupiers are forcibly forcing people to leave Ukraine for Russia
> 
> Over the past week, several thousand Mariupol residents were deported to Russia. The occupiers illegally removed people from the Left Bank district and shelters in the building of the sports club, where more than a thousand people (mostly women and children) were hiding from the constant bombing. Fighting took place in these areas. To save the lives of Mariupol residents, the Armed Forces of Ukraine withdrew from crowded places, which was used by the aggressor.
> 
> It is known that the captured Mariupol residents were taken to filtration camps, where the occupiers checked people's phones and documents. After the inspection, some Mariupol residents were redirected to remote cities in Russia, the fate of others remains unknown.
> 
> ""What the occupiers are doing today is familiar to the older generation, who saw the horrific events of World War II, when the Nazis forcibly captured people. It is hard to imagine that in the 21st century people will be forcibly deported to another country. Not only are Russian troops destroying our peaceful Mariupol, they have gone even further and started deporting Mariupol residents.

The Abrams tanks are notoriously difficult to kill as well, and the US has much more disciplined combined arms tactics that should leave them less vulnerable to infantry ambush.

 >The Russian apartment bombings were a series of explosions that hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in September 1999, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1,000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. Then-prime minister Vladimir Putin's handling of the crisis boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.

Keep in mind that a huge chunk who follow state media still believe the lie that there is no war - that this is still a ""rescue"" mission of sorts and the only people dying are Ukrainian ""nazi occupiers"", whereas Ukrainian civilians are the abused captives of a western puppet state. The very few people I've met here who believe that feel as sad about deaths as anyone in the west - they're just severely misled about who is dying and for what. 

I'd also suggest considering a lot of nuance in your view of Russians. A lot of what people believe depends on their location, age, economic situation, and experience with the west. For example, here in st Petersburg, people are a lot more europeanised and liberal than other parts of the country - Moscow too. All my teen students are unanimously and strongly against the government and are quite informed about the real situation in Ukraine. I don't personally know a single person here who believes the state media narrative and supports what Russia is doing. That's my own experience of course, and I've heard of people who follow the state narrative. I'm absolutely sure, though, that these polls talking about 80-90% of Russians supporting war against NATO are complete bullshit. 

The sad fact is, we are all terrified of speaking up and having armoured guys visit our place, trash it, and beat the shit out of us, losing out jobs, losing our kids. Those of us with the means are getting out as fast as possible. The unfortunate remainder are probably heading to a kind of North Korea style system (as long as it holds). Any activism will be picked apart before it can even be organized. Anyone mentioning or talking about protests is getting arrested. I wouldn't look for an uprising here to save Ukraine.

That's an interesting situation, if you're talking about the recent mall attack. The story goes that the Russians got intel from TikTok videos, and subsequently used a drone to confirm the intel, and discovered the Ukrainians were using the parking garage of that mall as a staging/arming area for its MLRS systems. There was [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/tjelwk/russian_drone_footage_and_hit_kiev/) posted to r/combatfootage that showed the events leading up to the mall bombing.

Europeans have a more standard education, without these extremes. 

The polarization and stratification in the U.S. also lead to education being more of an identity. You're educated and you basically nerd out, you define yourself in opposition to say normies, frat boys, conservatives, creationists and non-vaxxers, etc. You love literature, science, go to bar trivia, listen to NPR... Obviously this sort of self-segregation happens in Europe too but not the same extent. I dated a German girl while I studied overseas and her knowledge of history, culture, etc. was greater than the median American, but I didn't find this out for a while, because all she cared about was going to the club and high end fashion. This flabbergasted me as an American because why would you know Doestoevsky and not be into him? There just seems to be more polarization here in the US in every sense of the word.

My understanding at the start of the war is the Russians hit a ton of those locations thinking they were going to take out Ukrainian air defense but they were smarties and had that stuff dispersed. It would make sense to avoid known locations like barracks that are within range of Russian attack or cannot be adequately defended against the air. 

Conventional wisdom said all their good stuff would have been zotted from the air but nothing is playing out as people would have anticipated. I doubt most of us would have thought the air war would still be contested this far in. I think it's a no-brainer to say it would be a far different war if that were settled. 

The general rule that seems to hold true from the Gulf Wars is you can't operate a conventional force when the enemy owns the air but air power doesn't do much against guerillas who cannot be easily distinguished from civilians from the air, especially in cities. 

The other general rule from the idiotic wars on terror which we should have already known from Vietnam is if the locals don't want you there, they're not going to be able to physically remove you but they'll keep bleeding your wallet and your soldiers as long as you stay in the game. You can't kill enough locals to break the will of an insurgency unless you kill them all.

 >Defeat in detail, or divide and conquer, is a military tactic of bringing a large portion of one's own force to bear on small enemy units in sequence, rather than engaging the bulk of the enemy force all at once. This exposes one's own units to many small risks but allows for the eventual destruction of an entire enemy force.

More of Putin’s 7D chess, I gather.

Because Putin has always sat around simply waiting for leverage instead of creating his own and then blaming the other side.

Did Ukraine and the US create a virus that solely targets Slavs? Were the Ukrainians committing genocide against Russian speaking Ukrainians? No? Did it stop Putin from claiming as such?

If he wants leverage, he lies or he sets something up and blames the other side. It’s literally how he set up his career with the explosion of that apartment complex.

If Putin wanted leverage against NATO all he’d have to do is stage an attack, claim it was NATO, and declare war on NATO. He could just claim it was NATO who attacked first and in turn it was NATO that declared war on him.

But he doesn’t do that. Putin doesn’t want NATO involvement which is why he doesn’t cross NATO borders. 

Instead of just parroting what you read on Twitter or whatever, just take one minute to follow the logic and see if it tracks. This whole thing where anyone asking for NATO intervention is a Russian bot sent by Putin to somehow instigate a NATO attack through social media posts that would then justify Putin declaring war on NATO is as ridiculous as it’s convoluted. Zelenskyy himself asked for NATO to close the air space, is he a Russian bot? Why would Russian bots support Zelenskyy?

Real world politics are more Occam’s Razor and less these bizarre pulp fiction plots drummed up by the likes of Qanon or Tom Clancy. I know some of you are terribly disappointed by this but that’s reality. Putin is not some genius criminal mastermind, he’s a thug turned dictator who is completely detached from reality, a shut in surrounded by yes men who continues to stun the world with the breadth of his sheer military incompetence.",1647933528.0,1647932325.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1msx8b,,2,8,0,8,0,0,

His epithet does not derive from the modern word ""unready"", but rather from the Old English unræd meaning ""poorly advised""; it is a pun on his name, which means ""well advised"". Æthelred was the son of King Edgar the Peaceful and Queen Ælfthryth.

 >The FGM-148 Javelin (AAWS-M) is an American-made portable anti-tank missile system in service since 1996, and continuously upgraded. It replaced the M47 Dragon anti-tank missile in US service. Its fire-and-forget design uses automatic infrared guidance that allows the user to seek cover immediately after launch, as opposed to wire-guided systems, like the system used by the Dragon, which require the user to guide the weapon throughout the engagement. The Javelin's HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks by hitting them from above where their armor is thinnest, and is also useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight.

 >The law of war is the component of international law that regulates the conditions for initiating war (jus ad bellum) and the conduct of warring parties (jus in bello). Laws of war define sovereignty and nationhood, states and territories, occupation, and other critical terms of law. Among other issues, modern laws of war address the declarations of war, acceptance of surrender and the treatment of prisoners of war; military necessity, along with distinction and proportionality; and the prohibition of certain weapons that may cause unnecessary suffering.

 >The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia is a geopolitical book by Aleksandr Dugin. Its publication in 1997 was well received in Russia; it has had significant influence within the Russian military, police and foreign policy elites and has been used as a textbook in the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. Powerful Russian political figures subsequently took an interest in Dugin, a Russian political analyst who espouses an ultranationalist and neo-fascist ideology based on his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, who has developed a close relationship with Russia's Academy of the General Staff.

The same goes for their small arms ammunition and every other piece of kit they could conceivably need. They're going to need to drive unless you intend for them to walk the 400+ miles before entering the fray in Mariupol. Those vehicles will need fuel. Either accompanying them (in vehicles that will also require fuel and parts) or pre-staged along the route. Some of those vehicles can and will break down and need replacement parts. Some might get stuck and need recovery vehicles to pull them out. Those recovery vehicles (and their crews) will also have logistics tails. All of this in an active war zone where ""the enemy gets a vote"" and these assets can (and would) be targetted with indirect fire, standoff munitions, air attack, etc. Meaning you're going to need to plan for medical contingencies.

Sometimes called the ""hail mary."" That was a roughly 150-mile sweep west by U.S. Army and coalition ally ground forces into Iraq that cut off supply lines and retreat for many Republican Guard troops. Here's a [good graphic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/DesertStormMap_v2.svg/1920px-DesertStormMap_v2.svg.png) showing how that went. 

Some key notes on differences between this and that: 

* It took several months of carefully repositioning and planning this operation. All in territory 100% controlled by the coalition with no chance of enemy interference. Also, all of the necessary movements happened in remote and harsh areas (which made logistics tough but ensured that the forces couldn't be spotted by locals/media/etc.) 

* While that repositioning and planning were happening, there was a month-long air campaign going on to attrite the Iraqis they would face once the ground operation kicked off. 

* There was a MASSIVE [deception operation](https://www.stripes.com/special-reports/the-gulf-war-25-year-anniversary/left-hook-deception-hastened-gulf-war-s-end-1.388681) designed to make the Iraqis believe this attack was unlikely and keep them committed to where we wanted them to think the attack would be: from the Persian Gulf by sea and across the Saudi/Kuwaiti border by land. This included everything from positioning diversionary forces in staging areas visible to the Iraqis to deliberately giving the press the perception that this would be the main attack. They reported it over and over and the Iraqis were watching and planned accordingly. 

It worked beautifully but again, required months and months of logistics preparation, supporting air attacks to soften the Iraqi forces, detailed planning, and deception efforts.",1647964051.0,1647963856.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1o81wa,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

>	Navalny soon found a new ideological niche. In the late 2000s, he declared himself a nationalist. He participated in the far-right Russian Marches, waged war on “illegal immigration,” and even launched campaign “Stop Feeding the Caucasus” directed against government subsidies to poor, ethnic minority-populated autonomous regions in the south of the country. It was a time when right-wing sentiments were widespread, and urban youth sympathized with ultra-right groups almost en masse. It seemed to Navalny that this wind would fill his sails — and partly, it worked.






https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56181084

I completely understand how it is hard to sift through Western news to find a good source.

—
A senior US defense official held a background briefing today, major points/summary thread.

""The only thing that I would say that's different since the last time we had a chance to talk is that we have seen some increased naval activity in the northern Black Sea.""

""The Russians have a little bit more than a dozen warships, different stripes and sizes -- amphibious ships, surface combatants, mine sweeper and some patrol boats that they've got up in the northern Black Sea""

""It is not clear that this is an imminent pre-staging sign of an amphibious assault on Odesa, so it would be, at this point, we would assess that it would be wrong to conclude that this is somehow an indication that Odesa is under an imminent threat of an amphibious assault""

""On the hypersonic claim that the Russians made, we're not able to refute it, but we can't independently confirm it, either. It's not entirely clear. So what we would assess is it's certainly possible. But it's a bit of a head-scratcher, to be honest with you""

""it's not exactly clear why, if it's true, why would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building? It could be that they're running low on precision-guided munitions and feel like they need to tap into that resource.""

""It could be that they're trying to send a message to the west, but also to Ukraine, and trying to gain some leverage at the negotiating table. But it's a -- from a military perspective, if it was a hypersonic missile there's not a whole lot of practicality about it.""

Responding to a question on leadership- ""The other thing is, Jack -- and people forget this... they [Russia] don't organize their military the way we do. They don't have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officers corps, for instance""

""And their [Russia] junior officers don't have the same wherewithal, flexibility... they don't invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do.""

""You know that we [the US] put a lot into an E-4 and an E-5 and an E-6 to -- to make decisions literally in the moment on the battlefield. They don't have that kind of a tradition. They don't have that structure.""

""We believe that they [Russia] are having command-and-control problems just in terms of communications... they just weren't fully prepared for operations of this intensity for this long on so many different multiple lines of attack""

""We do see them having some command-and-control difficulties, both in terms of a military operational concept issue, being able to integrate air to ground, to make decisions in real-time effectively, but also in terms of their ability to communicate over established links.""

""We're seeing them [Russia] use a lot more unclassified communications because their classified communications capability is -- is being -- is -- well, for one reason or another, is not as strong as it should be."" (Sounds like he slipped up and almost said being jammed or disrupted)

In response to a change in strategy- ""What we assess is that they [Russia] are looking for a chance to break out, they are looking for a chance to gain some momentum, not even re-gain momentum, because they never really had it, and that's what's so frustrating for them.""

""I mean, when you look at the map, you can count literally on one hand the number of population centers that we assess are in Russian control right now.""

""So what -- so what have they gained in -- in now 26 days? They got Melitopol', they got Berdyans'k and they got Kherson. That's it. They don't have Kyiv, they don't have Kharkiv, they don't have Mariupol, although... I mean, there's a lot of fighting going on there.""

""They [Russia] haven't achieved anything, in terms of what we assess to be their objectives, which is population centers so that they could occupy and take over Ukraine.""

""With these increased long range fires, missile strikes, artillery bombardments, in trying to encircle cities so that you can lob more long range fires into those cities, is a reflection of what some people believe is a desperate attempt by them [Russia] to gain some momentum,""

""And rather than demoralizing the Ukrainians, I think you've all seen that this kind of violence has only motivated them more, which means that they're resisting more, which means the Russians continue to get frustrated and flummoxed and kind of stuck where they are.""

""I mean, my goodness, here we are, day 26, they're still -- we still hold them a good 15 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, which is where they were last week. We still hold them about 30 kilometers from the east of Kyiv, which is where they were last week when we talked before.""

""Again, not that we're pushing back on this idea of a war of attrition but we're not exactly using that phrase here. What we're seeing is a near desperate attempt by the Russians to gain some momentum and try to turn the course of this in their favor.""

""Sanders is treading a very fine line in making a point that was once mainstream and common sense, but has in the current political climate become unspeakable: that maybe the US policy of enlarging the anti-Soviet military alliance right up to Russia’s borders has not been particularly wise or reasonable — and may, in fact, be a root cause of the current tensions.

Sanders’s op-ed comes as progressives in Congress have been increasingly vocal against Washington escalation in Ukraine. Last week, Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) warned the Democrats’ bill to send $500 million worth of military aid to the country — coming at a point when even the Biden administration is joining the rest of the world in admitting a Russian invasion may not actually be imminent — simply “escalates the conflict without deterring it effectively.” Two weeks before that, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) cautioned that “there is not a military solution to this problem,” warning it could spark an energy crisis, and blaming it all on a military-industrial complex “starved of revenue” since the Afghanistan pullout.""

At the very least, do you acknowledge the existence of the Monroe doctrine, and the consequences for peace if other powers choose to ignore it? I think it's very easy to talk in black and white terms (appeasement bringing memories of Chamberlain and ww2, right), while our politics and economies are not ruled like that at all (look at how much Europe is still directly financing Russia through buying natural gas and other resources).

There were Nato exercises in Ukraine last year, right? Can we acknowledge that the West had a hand in provoking Russia, or is any provocation ok as long as it's done by ""us"" to ""them""? I am not trying to victim blame Ukraine here - I am pointing out that Chomsky has a point about the Western powers provoking Russia ever since it was down, ignored that Russia is not as weak as at the fall of USSR, and now Ukrainians are paying a price for this ""grand game"". Where do you draw the line on provocations?

 >An ice cream barge was a vessel employed by the United States Navy in the Pacific Theatre of World War II to produce ice cream in large quantities to be provisioned to sailors and Marines. The craft, a concrete barge acquired from the U.S. Army and worth $1 million, was able to create 10 US gallons (38 l) of ice cream every seven minutes, or approximately 500 US gal (1,900 l) per shift, and could store 2,000 US gal (7,600 l). It was employed in the USN's Western Pacific area of operations, at one point anchored at Ulithi.

https://mobile.twitter.com/kamilkazani/status/1499382719444402176

The Chechens are overburdened with lots of equipment and never look dirty in photo ops. They are not fighting on the front line. Kadyrov, for instance, dressed up and took photos in an office claiming to be in Ukraine himself to supervise the invasion. However, his phone was geotagged in Grozny on the same day. 

He wasn't there. It was a photo op. It's for morale.

The Chechens are there as terror police. Just like Rosgvardiya, they are SWAT teams who do war crimes.

 Kadyrov holds so much influence in the hierarchy of power within the Russian state that he will not typically let them engage on the main front. His forces are almost independent, compared with Dagestan's next door which are just folded in to the regular army (and reflect high body counts, accordingly).

The failed attack on Antonov/Hostomel airport in early days --in which Kadyrov's favorite, Mhd. Tushayev, was rumored to have been killed -- was a notable indicator (special ops to grab Zelensky, designed against no military resistance). They only seem to attack civil targets.

 This accords with the Russian plan to war crime til victory. Russia is not able to engage effectively against UA forces due to bad comms, bad tires, bad command chains, and bad morale.

I doubt the efficacy of Chechens, as well, due to a similarly highly stodgy command structure with no real NCO freedom to operate. It's a Soviet military with no institutional learning, corrupted by dvor e zakone from the inside.",False,1647972643.0,t3_tjueug,t1_i1ou5gv,,4,3,0,3,0,0,

Yeah, I am sure they can just swing by the local ATB-Market (like Ukraine's version of Wal-Mart) on their way to Mariupol and pick up a bunch of Javelin Tandem Charge warheads. /s

Moving a sizable military force 400+ miles in combat to lift a siege under the assumption that ""we can just get whatever we need on the way"" is ridiculous. I worked for the US Army in the Baltics in 2014 and 2015 and moving a Battalion 200 miles, in friendly terrain where we had full cooperation from local governments, in peace time conditions was a ***massive*** logistical undertaking that required weeks of planning. And that was a significantly less complicated operation on a timeline we thought was... ambitious.  

>the inference it is impossible to e.g. reinforce the forces working to retake Kherson if Kyiv threat it reduced because it is just too far because, Patton, is silly

My inference was that it is nearly impossible due to terrain, distance, weather, infrastructure, considerations about lines of supply and lines of communication and I used Patton as a historic example of how one of the most highly respected military commanders of the last 100 years once did something about 1/10th as complicated and is ***still*** venerated for it.

The end goal would be to last until backup/supplies arrive.

Ukraine's goal now is to make sure the Russian support never arrives and to starve the Russian forces until they eventually surrender.

Despite the favourable position the Ukrainians are in, the Russians still have a stronger military, and the Russians are 100% going to try and break the Ukrainian encirclement.

So it has to be able to deliver at _least_ as much as that. And they have the capability of presenting a smaller area to such a weapon by rotating. As for blinding, they can't really blind a phased array antenna part, since that operates in the radio, and any optical laser links, which point satellite to satellite, can just physically shut their ports to protect equipment, or again, make such an attack HAVE to come directly in a line from satellite to satellite. (They could try to _jam_ it - but I recently read an article somewhere (looking for it now) that says that phased array antennas are ridiculously hard to jam - you basically have to have a jammer in line of sight between the intended jam-ee and every starlilink satellite.)

So it would pretty much have to be in orbit. Which now requires a ridiculous power source, or capacitor bank, neither of which are that light - which requires heavy lifting capability.

It's very analogous to what we're discussing. The movement I'm talking about would actually be bigger/more complicated. A full-strength Battalion (depending on the Battalion) is around 800 guys. The op that I'm discussing wasn't even a full-strength Battalion... it was around 300-400 troops and maybe 50 vehicles. The Ukrainians would need way more than that to break a siege that people have compared to Stalingrad in terms of ferocity. 

>Austin has ordered an infantry battalion task force of about 800 soldiers to deploy from Italy to the Baltic region.

Yeah, that is Airborne forces. The Italy unit is the 173rd Airborne Brigade. They are ***designed*** to be rapidly deployable and the 173rd does things like this all the time. When I was in Estonia, I watched them do a no-notice deployment from Italy to Estonia with two companies (about 300 guys) and again, this was in peacetime with full local government cooperation and no enemy contesting the movement. It was still very hard. A force necessary to break the siege would need to be a lot bigger. Airborne forces can move fast by nature but they're not good at taking on the types of forces we see in Mariupol (T-80's, BMP's, BTR's, etc.) 

The F-35s and Apaches can be quickly redeployed to other countries... because 1) they're not fighting anybody. 2) They're moving in and through areas that aren't active war zones. 3) They have the slight advantage of *being able to fly.*

* We didn't pay much attention to *most German things* during the 40s, for obvious reasons.  Geopolitical opposition and wartime footing is completely incompatible with cultural engagement and interplay.
* Subsequently, there's still a whole lot of previously-OK things that are still stained by association with Germany in the 1940s or the South in the early 1800s, because the victims of these things legitimately view them as symbols of their oppression 200 years later.
* It's important to reach a middle ground, where there is positive engagement (trade and cultural) *going forward* and where the *specific concerns of those who were oppressed are respected*.  Where exactly that line is can be hard to negotiate.  Most would think that buying a German car is unconditionally OK, but I am friends with a couple where the wife is Jewish and was pretty upset her husband bought a Volkswagen, given that VW was literally founded by the Nazis, even though it's decades later and ownership and control are completely different.
* Tchaikovsky is unlikely to have lasting stain.  Then again, if Russia started publishing videos everywhere of blaring the 1812 Overture out of combat helicopters while killing innocents, I think it would fall *greatly* in American consciousness and might be difficult for a lot of people to stomach it for a long time.

Only the first Iraqi war was a war of aggression against a neighbor, and it didn't create a substantive refugee population in Western countries.  Suppressing historical Vietnamese culture when we ended up with lots of historically-inclined Vietnamese as refugees wouldn't make much sense, would it?

> Firing some pianist because he is russian

Probably a mistake, but it was done because he was acting as an irritant to a large Ukrainian refugee population in the area.

Note that he wasn't fired-- a *performance was cancelled*.

> removing the good work Russian scientists did for the space program

...Because the program is saber-rattling about not giving American astronauts a ride home and is choosing to not fulfill launch contracts.
