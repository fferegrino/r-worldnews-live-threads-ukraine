fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,150w1cd,js8w34i,"Day 504-508 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today we had 3 consecutive missile strikes targeting just Kharkiv alone (and more if you count the ones that targeted Kharkiv oblast). It was pretty sudden since we had a pretty long period of relative quiet before today, and the air raid alert didn’t even start here until the entire first missile strike (during the day) had already ended, so it was pretty useless. I guess the people responsible for air raid alert were caught off guard as well because we haven’t had any missile strikes in so long here.

I don’t think Russians ever hit us with 3 separate missile strikes in a single day before, so it’s pretty notable. Though they didn’t use all that many missiles in any of the strikes. They used 2-4 missiles per strike, and probably around 12 of them total (not counting any missiles used to strike Kharkiv oblast, just the city). For comparison, last year there were days where they would hit our city with up to 20 S-300 missiles in a single strike, so what we saw today was nothing special.

As usual they were targeting civilians, mostly unsuccessfully, but sadly they did manage to kill 1 person and also injure at least 4 more. At night they hit an empty road and a football stadium (almost certainly one near a school judging by the photos that were released). During the day there was another strike, there was no official info about their target, but the people living nearby said that they hit a popular place near some school that is always packed with civilians, so it’s a miracle that there weren’t more casualties. Then they hit us again in the evening and they targeted the same general area for the second time in a row. We haven’t heard explosions in quite some time, so hearing so many of them in one day definitely wasn’t a pleasant experience.",False,1689546086.0,t3_150w1cd,t3_150w1cd,,0,149,0,149,8,2,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 2, 'gid_3': 1}"

SK is also very likely to backfill US artillery stores. 

It seems extremely likely that Japan will follow a similar path. 

Both want to move closer to NATO, one way to telegraph that desire is by doing more for Ukraine. 

I don’t buy the idea of the west growing tired of supporting the conflict, it’s also important to note that we’re seeing increased support from East Asia. 

Western countries stuck by Afghanistan for over a decade when it was clear they cared more than afghanis. The west will stick by Ukraine too.

There’s several things that Russia is actually good at, that presents a challenge to Ukraine.  They don’t have to even be superior, just being good presents a challenge:

First—not valuing life + sheer numbers of personnel.  

Second—extensive mining. 

Third—time, which has allowed Russia to entrench.

Fourth—air power.

Fifth—electronic warfare (“EW,” or “REB” in direct Ukrainian transliteration)

*Regarding that fifth issue:*

Here’s an interview of a(n) [Ukrainian Father-Son team who have invented a way to circumvent that Russian capability, rendering it void](https://fakty-ua.translate.goog/422624-na-fronte-nash-robot-yanki-budet-sohranyat-zhizn-bojcov-syn-s-otcom-sozdali-soldata-na-kolesah-osnacshennogo-oruzhiem-i-upravlyaemogo-po-radio?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)

The interview is interesting. But here’s the main point:

Despite this war being so drone-focused, Russia is able to disable many Ukrainian drones by their EW capabilities. [elsewhere, I’ve read assessments that UA has superior EW capabilities, but RF’s is ‘good enough’ to blunt UA’s drone efficacy].

Ukrainian Father-son team invent a “ground drone” to draw out the Russians from their positions, after learning that the Russians EW capabilities were weak-to-nonexistent at the first 6 meters, ground-up.

Their ground drone is essentially a motorized cart carrying artillery, electronically controlled (looks like a gadget would get at Christmastime from Radio Shack). The Russians end up betraying their cloaked positions when try to destroy the motorized gadget. 

They put a grenade launcher or something that size on it, can control it up to 1.5km away.  

They are not yet in use at the front line, but since their estimated cost is only $2000 each, they are currently revved up to go in to production. Calling it ‘Yankee.’",1689535252.0,1689534267.0,t3_150w1cd,t3_150w1cd,,0,65,0,65,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-16-23/index.html

""US national security adviser Jake Sullivan confirmed Sunday that the US will allow European countries to start training Ukrainian fighter pilots to use F-16 fighter jets, after reports that Europe was awaiting formal approval. 

“Yes, we will,” Sullivan told CNN's Jake Tapper when asked. “The president has given a green light and we will allow, permit, support, facilitate and in fact provide the necessary tools for Ukrainians to begin being trained on F-16s, as soon as the Europeans are prepared.” 

Sullivan noted that European leaders have said they need several weeks to prepare training abilities and that the US would meet whatever timeline they set out.

“The United States will not be the hold up in ensuring that this F-16 training can get underway,” he said.

Remember: Ukraine's quest for the superior US-made fighter jets received a huge boost when the Biden administration said in May that it would back a training program for pilots and would not disallow allies from supplying Kyiv with the planes. But the US has not said that it will supply Kyiv with F-16s directly.

What US lawmakers are saying: Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat and former Navy pilot who sits on the Armed Services Committee, defended the timeline for directly supplying the fighting aircraft to Ukraine.

Responding to perceived criticism that the administration is slow-walking the decision to send F-16s, Kelly said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that it will take time and resources to train Ukrainian pilots on how to fly the aircraft in the first place.

“This is going to take some time. I don't think it's been slow-walked, but the process is a lot longer,” Kelly said, adding that during a visit to Ukraine in April, President Volodymyr Zelensky and his team still weren't certain what specific combat missions they wanted to use the jets for.

By contrast, Sen. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican and former Marine who also sits on the Armed Services Committee, criticized the Biden administration's approach.

While he praised Biden for his actions at the recent summit for the NATO military alliance, he criticized the administration for “slow-rolling” weapons systems to Ukraine, specifically citing the F-16s.

“As I predicted, they're eventually going to do it, but it's too darn long. That's exactly what happened,” said Sullivan.""",False,1689528292.0,t3_150w1cd,t3_150w1cd,,0,43,0,43,0,0,

>While the U.S. hasn’t agreed to supply ATACMS missiles sought by Kyiv, London and Paris have supplied longer-range cruise missiles that can hit anywhere in occupied parts of Ukraine, and that are being used against Russian command posts, logistics nodes and ammunition depots. Washington hasn’t delivered pledged Abrams tanks, while scores of German and British tanks already are on the battlefield. The Biden administration has also slow-rolled European efforts to provide Kyiv with F-16 aircraft owned by countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway.

Macron, who sought diplomatic engagement with Putin last year, has become increasingly convinced of the need for a Ukrainian victory—a belief he expressed in a landmark speech in Bratislava, Slovakia, on May 31. “Only one peace is possible—a peace that respects international law and is chosen by the victims of the aggression, the Ukrainian people,” he said.

The Russian General Staff already dismissed commanders of the 7th and 106th VDV divisions Kornev and Selivestorov.

It is not clear if the recording is authentic, yet Teplinsky presents a valuable goal for the New Purge carried out by the Kremlin Ripper after the failed Prigozhin's mutiny.

b1e05e5d1b4645426d6dd59a71896287,150w1cd,js7zzpy,"Putin warns he will use more cluster munitions if Ukraine deploys them. 
From CNN's Uliana Pavlova 7/16/23.

""Russian President Vladimir Putin warned he will use more cluster munitions if Ukraine also deploys the controversial weapons, adding that Russia has sufficient reserves.
Both Moscow and Kyiv have already deployed cluster munitions during the war, ...

Putin claimed ""Russia has a sufficient supply of various types of cluster munitions,"" but has held off from fully employing it.  ""But of course, if they are used against us, we reserve the right to mirror actions,"" he added.""

RU: Hey no fair, if you keep using these then I will just use moar!! Really we've been holding back this whole invasion, such amazing restraint...

""Key context: While Putin highlighted what he views as US hypocrisy on the use of cluster munitions, Washington has sought to draw a distinction between Russia's use of the weapons and how Ukraine will employ the US-provided bombs.

To start, US officials argue, Kyiv will use the weapons on its own territory and to defend against an ""aggressive war"" launched by Russia.

The Pentagon says Ukraine will also use much more care to employ the weapons only against military targets, and then make every effort to sweep for unexploded bomblets, whereas it has accused Russia of ""indiscriminately killing civilians"" with the weapons.

Finally, the US says its version of the weapon has a much lower rate of failure than Moscow's cluster weapons, so the risk of unexploded bomblets is lower.

Russia has rejected and disputed these characterizations.""

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-16-23/index.html

""The United States is running low on ammunition in its own stockpile as the country works to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia, according to US national security adviser Jake Sullivan.

President Joe Biden's administration, upon taking office, “found that overall stocks of 155 munition, which is the NATO standard ammunition used for artillery rounds, was relatively low,” Sullivan said in an interview with CNN.

Sullivan said the administration also learned that it would take years, not months, to restock the supplies to acceptable levels — a daunting task for a nation supplementing the war in Ukraine.

“President Biden ordered his Pentagon to work rapidly to scale up the ability of the United States to produce all the ammunition we could ever need for any conflict at any time,” Sullivan said. “Month on month, we are increasing our capacity to supply ammunition.”

Earlier this year, CNN reported that Ukraine is burning through ammunition faster than the US and NATO can produce it, and that the Pentagon has taken a central role in trying to ramp up production.

On cluster munitions: The national security adviser was not able to say whether Ukraine was currently using the controversial cluster munitions Biden recently sent to Ukraine, but said, “if they have not been deployed yet, they will be in the coming hours or days.”

Sullivan confirmed that the munitions had arrived in the country, as CNN has previously reported.

“They have now very rapidly been shipped into the fight and are in the hands of Ukrainian defenders on the front lines,” he added.""",False,1689528054.0,t3_150w1cd,t3_150w1cd,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-16-23/index.html

""Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Ukranian counteroffensive has been ""unsuccessful,"" during an on-camera interview with pro-Krelmin journalist Pavel Zarubin published Sunday.

“All attempts by the enemy to break through our defenses, including with the use of strategic reserves, they were unsuccessful during the entire offensive. The enemy is not successful,” Putin said. “Our troops have behaved heroically. Unexpectedly for the enemy, in some areas (Russian troops) themselves go on the offensive, take the most advantageous positions,” he said.

Putin added that Russia has an opportunity to study the military equipment of enemy troops and see what can be used by Moscow.

""There is such an expression as reverse engineering,"" he said. ""If there is an opportunity to look inside and see if there is something that can be applied to us — well, why not?""

Kyiv says there is slow progress in counteroffensive: Senior Ukrainian officials and generals alike continue to describe tough fighting and limited progress on the battlefield as they look to drive Russian forces out of the country and turn the tide of the war.

Just days after Ukraine’s key partners met at the NATO summit in Lithuania, pledging even deeper security ties — albeit without specifying any timetable for Ukraine's potential membership in the alliance — Kyiv insists it does not feel under pressure to deliver quick results. 

Speaking to journalists Friday in Kyiv following his attendance at the NATO summit, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, admitted the counteroffensive — seen as being underway since the start of June — was “hard work.”

“It’s not going that fast; it is slow,” he said, adding that it is important Ukrainians are told the truth about developments on the ground.""",False,1689528498.0,t3_150w1cd,t3_150w1cd,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Erdogan was seemingly one of the only NATO leaders that Putin was willing to speak with. As Russian forces prepared to create an incident at Zaporizhia, Erdogan must have told Putin incredibly bluntly, that the rest of NATO is not saber rattling when they say this would invoke Article 5, but they well and truly mean it, and Erdogan warns Putin not go through with Zaporizhzia unless he wants to fight the totality of NATO. Putin must of told to get f****ed, and said you can't have Russian support in certain areas anymore, but still realized after the fact Erdogan is right.
Zaporizhzia now de-escalates and is not as large a looming crisis as it once was and Erdogan is forced to even rely harder to make NATO and his other alliances work because he knows that any relationship with Russia while Putin is in charge will be too volatile and have to many conditions, hence the change in tone coming out of Turkiye. I know there was some speculation that much of it was election posturing for Erdogan, but I don't think the election outcome was ever in question in Turkey with how Erdogan operates.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/15/more-than-four-in-ten-republicans-now-say-the-us-is-providing-too-much-aid-to-ukraine/


To put things in perspective, Trump is the most rabid unfailing pro Russia / pro Putin Republican the party has had in decades, if ever. And he is currently set to be the GOP nominee for the 2024 Presidential campaign.  

His political stance has always been pro Russia and anti-Ukraine.  If he becomes President again, you can expect military and financial aid to Ukraine from the US to plummet, even if support has majority of the populace. It may cause him to be impeached again like he was for his 1st impeachment, which involved him freezing congress approved military equipment for Ukraine. Then the GOP in congress will rally around him because opportunistic power is what they lust for.

Right wing Propaganda and Russian Propaganda is a very VERY overlapping Venn diagram.  The very significant change in support for Ukraine from Republicans, seems pretty evident that the Russian propaganda is once again working on them, via social media, via people like Tucker Carlson, MTG, Fox News, etc.",False,1689490006.0,t3_150w1cd,t1_js5q5ry,,1,38,0,38,0,0,

(1) US Federal misdemeanor of misrepresenting military record 

He apparently lied for years in the US about his military record, including to his wife?  Under certain circumstances, that is a federal crime.  Even if he does it abroad.  I hope the US Attorney of Connecticut is looking at this.  

Has to be more than leveraging his record to get married (that’s a different fraud and also grounds for annulment), or to cheat on her with that Huggett lady, or with that lady with the second lady.

More like, if leverage his fraudulent representation of military record to gain something—a position, a contract, weapons, authority—some tangible benefit. 

(Clout would not count.)

(2) Fraud

But as well-sourced as this article it, no one knows what he actually *did*.  No one says concretely which unit he worked with, just that he went in after the fight was over and he put his unit in jeopardy.  And also he was chilling in Kyiv.  How did he support himself?  Where was he staying in Kyiv? How paying for it and for food?  —All that seems ripe for a fraud investigation.

Wartime fraud is something taking place in Ukraine, sadly.  Exploiters exist everywhere.  And the first few months, all investigations focused on rooting out the pro-R citizens who were helping the enemy.  But for many months, there’s been a return-to-normal in the local and federal investigation offices so that other crimes don’t thrive, and fraud and exploitation is a major chunk of the cases investigated and charged.

Here is an interesting discussion on the topic of striking the bridge from westpoint. This was written up after the last strike.

>To sum up, assuming Ukrainian agents conducted the operation against the Kerch Strait Bridge, the attack was plainly lawful under IHL. The bridge was a military objective because Russian armed forces regularly used it for military purposes. And the attack was not disproportionate, i.e., the expected incidental loss of civilian life was not excessive compared to the military advantage that Ukraine could anticipate from damaging the bridge. Further, the attack appears to have been conducted in a manner designed to minimize harm to civilians, as is required by the rule on taking precautions in attack. Finally, the attack was not an “act of terrorism” in any international legal sense of the word; in particular, it was clearly not done for the purpose of spreading terror in the civilian population.

I've read here that its a huge supply line.

In my head - its good the bridge is destroyed, but there is the enivitable problem of Russians who live there and what to do with them in a fair way. Ideally they leave, but thats not how populations work.

Russia is engaging in counterattacks. Part of their doctrine is when they lose ground in an area to respond with an attack. This is a pretty standard doctrinal issue since World War I for many militaries. [Military historian Brett Deveraux has some good discussion of some of this in this essay](https://acoup.blog/2021/09/17/collections-no-mans-land-part-i-the-trench-stalemate/comment-page-1/). But the upshot is that something can look like an ""offensive"" even if it is in fact in response to a recent attack where one just lost ground. So looking where an army by itself is reported to be on the offensive doesn't tell you much without more context.

Ok so as I understand, the various Kherson hospitals each has a group of in-house collaborators, like random doctors or junior administrators, and they’d then put these collaborators in senior positions.  So, for example, if someone in nephrology was cooperating, they’re now the head of nephrology.  Or if the head pulmonologist was a collaborator, they’re now the head administrator and hospitalist.  This rearrangement in-part helped bc people were then working outside their realm of expertise and were thus unable to accomplish certain tasks—mass theft of computer records being one, as I understand.  Were inefficient.  Were ignorant of certain procedures, protocols, etc and thus certain resistance could be done right under their nose and they didn’t know it. (Does this sound right?)

But also, for medical equipment, this means people are authorizing/overseeing the illegal confiscation of medical equipment that they may not fully understand.  Items with delicate parts.  Or here, something that will be rendered useless.  

I’ve also read that in Kherson, those collaborators were getting advice from the personnel who were in fact actually part of that department, and those advisors were secretly in contact w the GUR who advise them how to handle situations, and thus would sometimes appear to also be collaborators because were being advised to look like cooperating but in reality make assistance null & void.  So here, it’s possible that Russians ordered the seizure of all useable medical equipment to hospital administrators, who in turn ordered it to the staff.  The staff, many of whom quietly worked against Russia’s interest, but knowing that they have to at least appear to obey, handed over equipment which would be burdensome to move, knowing full well that the RF military moving said equipment are ignorant of the fact that disconnecting and transporting it renders it useless. Thus sabotaging the theft.  (Is that possible?)",1689530626.0,1689530362.0,t3_150w1cd,t1_js6z9h2,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Will they be able to push back any and all Russian advances over their last offensive? Probably. But by the end of that Russia will have further reserves, and the small groups Ukraine is deploying is never going to result in rapid gains, and likely no breakthrough either.

It reduced Kherson, Bakmut, Meriupol, and other Ukrainian cities it wanted to ""take"" to rubble with its artillery advantage and slowly ground them to bits.  That was the second phase of the war, after the failed Kiev 3 day assault.

I am not even an armchair tactician, so sneer away.

HIMARS and Western artillery supplies apparently  have reversed that, in that Ukraine has a range and accuracy advantage (not necessarily in numbers), which they are using, steadily over the last two months, to further attrit Russian artillery, anti-artillery, and ammunition/artillery stockpiles and logistics.

This could be significant in time, if and when Ukraine can achieve a significant breakthrough, if it is able to quickly use its mobilized forces to exploit this. The whole point of the last two months is to wear down the Russian tactical forces so that they will, somewhere, be unable to quickly be used to resist a breakthrough by Ukraine. Reports over the last few weeks indicate russian forces are stretched and Wagner is gone; we will see if these are true and if Ukraine can get past the russian defensive lines in sufficient bulk to accomplish a mechanized breakthrough like we saw earlier in Kharkiv.  I suspect it will take time, a lot more than we have patience for. 

This assumes Ukraine can continue to be re-stocked with HIMARS and 155 artillery ammunition, which I guess is a big if.  And it requires the West to continually resupply and commit to Ukraine, which the West has done so far, if too slowly.

Putin, with good reason, given his pro-Putin allies in the US and West and pure war fatigue is playing the long game and doubting the US's and Europe's commitment in the long term.

The point is that when you launch a regular orbital rocket, you can tell relatively early in the launch by the trajectory that it's an orbital rocket. You also announce ""we're launching an orbital rocket on this date, at this time"". Better to live stream it.

You do all this because there's exactly 1 type of vehicle in operation which goes into space on a suborbital trajectory and drops back down aiming at a military target: a nuclear-tipped strategic ICBM.

The *stupidest possible thing* you can do if you're a nuclear power, is to start launching weapons on re-entry vehicles on rockets...because there is no way to know way for any early-warning system - and those *do* flag orbital launches - to know whether or not such a launch contains a conventional or nuclear payload.

Such a thing goes up, NORAD says ""hey this looks like an ICBM?"" and best case scenario the US decides to wait and see what's about to fall on maybe Kyiv. Launch a bunch of these at once? Without telling anyone? Everytime, *everyone* is looking at those launches thinking ""how stupid is this about to get?"" or if they're the US: ""if this is about to go nuclear, should we launch now and hope we get all launch sites?"" - and they're not wrong to think so.

When the Chinese ""carrier-killer"" hypersonic was announced, this was the reason it wasn't really a threat: the missile launch *looks* identical to a nuclear ICBM launch. Which makes using it a non-starter: you could maybe get away with launching one, but in any quantity and it just looks like you might've launched a general nuclear first-strike in any conflict.",False,1689523105.0,t3_150w1cd,t1_js7adjt,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

The original version of the line appeared in B. Traven's novel The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1927):

    ""All right,"" Curtin shouted back. ""If you are the police, where are your badges? Let's see them.""

    ""Badges, to god-damned hell with badges! We have no badges. In fact, we don't need badges. I don't have to show you any stinking badges, you god-damned cabrón and chinga tu madre! Come out there from that shit-hole of yours. I have to speak to you.""

The line was popularized by John Huston's 1948 film adaptation of the novel, which was altered from its content in the novel to meet the Motion Picture Production Code regulations severely limiting profanity in film.[4] In one scene, a Mexican bandit leader named ""Gold Hat""[5] (portrayed by Alfonso Bedoya) tries to convince Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart)[6] that he and his company are Federales:

    Dobbs: ""If you're the police, where are your badges?""
    Gold Hat: ""Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges. I don't have to show you any stinkin' badges!""
