This comes on the heels of two more reports that appear to point at Prigozhin's imminent / in-process downfall.

A [long thread by the Institute for Study of War](https://nitter.nl/TheStudyofWar/status/1624778128777179136) fills in the broader picture and the steps they see as Gerasimov setting up a counter-Prigozhin offensive.

Prigozhin had an interview with infamous war crime aficionado Wargonzo, likely set up to make Prigozhin look bad. Prigozhin delivered in spades. He flat-out lied about never having criticized the war, shifted all blame for casualties, and said he never had political aspirations.

Most disastrously, Prigozhin openly said that Kremlin's goals were unrealistic, and it could take two years to retake Donbass alone. 

That alone would be enough to doom anyone, but this absolutely insane report from another Russian Z channel [makes an even more shocking claim](https://nitter.nl/GirkinGirkin/status/1624806473359413254).

Apparently mobiks assigned for rear duties behind Wagner are breaking their arms and legs and shooting themselves in the legs to avoid being near Wagner. Wagner has murdered multiple mobiks, threatened lots of others, and robbed almost everyone of all of their possessions. 

The most prophetic claim is:

> Now you understand why this Bereg incident excited Wagner PR so much. [...] If the truth is reveale in this case, many other things will be revealed too. That will be the end of both the Wagner PMC and the end of the political career of [Prigozhin]

The Bereg incident refers to Igor 'Bereg' Mangushev, the Russian nationalist who did that stage show with the skull of a Ukrainian Azovstal defender. Bereg was shot in the back of the head at point-blank range in Kadiivka, a major Wagner center feeding Bakhmut. Bereg was shot on the 4th and multiple Russian-language sources began reporting on the 9th that Bereg was shot by Wagner convicts who were trying to rob him and take his car.",False,1676254107.0,t3_1106k1p,t3_1106k1p,,0,59,0,59,0,0,

>*Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and financing of terrorism makes a mockery of the idea of a ‘rules-based order’*  
>  
>In the aftermath of the cold war, world powers put in place systems of global governance. The goal was to protect liberal values, human rights and the world economy, and to extinguish the threat of nuclear annihilation.  
>  
>The unquestionable success of this new rules-based international order was its reach, bringing in Russia and post-Soviet Union states as well as other burgeoning economies such as China and India.  
>  
>But such a system only works when its members follow the rules. With its violent and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, poisonous support of corruption and documented financing of terrorism, Vladimir Putin’s Russia makes a total mockery of the rules-based international order that gave us a unique period of peace and economic development.  
>  
>Yet, despite everything, Russia maintains a foothold in the global system it is doing everything it can to undermine. Russia sits on the UN Security Council and other UN bodies. The Security Council was created with the specific objective of preventing wars. How, then, can Russia remain a member after embarking on its war of aggression against Ukraine?  
>  
>We also have an international body to ensure global financial security — the Financial Action Task Force. Created by the G7, the FATF sets standards and promotes effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures to limit three main risks: money laundering, financing of terrorism and of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  
>  
>Today, FATF has 37 member states. These include Russia, despite evidence of the country failing to meet FATF standards on all three fronts.  
>  
>This month, FATF members will gather in Paris to consider further measures against Russia on a symbolic date — exactly one year since the invasion of Ukraine.  
>  
>Countless investigations have uncovered Russia’s complicity in money laundering, which has only increased following the introduction of wide-ranging sanctions since the full-scale invasion. Russia has also been found to have enabled or otherwise co-operated with various terrorist groups and blacklisted states, including the Wagner Group, the Taliban, Hizbollah, the Assad regime in Syria, North Korea and Iran.  
>  
>Iranian kamikaze drones were found to have been used to attack Ukrainian civilian targets, leading to further US sanctions in November 2022. Moreover, Russian individuals and entities were also placed under sanctions by the US in March 2022 for actions supporting the weapons of mass destruction and ballistic programmes of North Korea.  
>  
>These examples barely scratch the surface, however. Russia is also responsible for state-sponsored and criminal cyber threats to critical infrastructure. Its war against Ukraine is exacerbating the global energy crisis and drastically raising food costs, causing great harm across the world, especially in developing economies.  
>  
>In short, Russia is not simply undermining the global economic system. It is holding us all to ransom. More must be done, therefore.  
>  
>Ukraine calls on the FATF to expel Russia and blacklist it. This would arguably be the most effective tool for restricting terrorists’ access to the global economy, as it would force all states to apply enhanced due diligence to any transactions involving the financial system of a blacklisted jurisdiction.  
>  
>Sanctions are introduced by specific jurisdictions and are followed by their subjects. This leaves a big part of the global economy that has not introduced sanctions open to Russia.  
>  
>Blacklisting by the FATF would create universal controls and require enhanced due diligence. Any transaction with the Russian financial system would be reviewed and scrutinised.

Day 353-354 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Yesterday we had yet another missile strike aimed at Kharkiv and, unsurprisingly, it happened at 11pm as usual, for some reason they really love this specific time for bombing our city. I’m pretty sure they fired about 8 missiles, but we only heard about 5-6 explosions in the city and some of them were very loud, our windows were shacking from the shockwave, which hasn’t happened in a while.

Apparently at least 1 of the missiles malfunctioned and fell in Belgorod oblast, because their S-300 missiles are, thankfully, garbage and their failure rate is extremely high. There was just one fire that started in the city after the strike, it was put out pretty fast. As usual they didn’t hit a military target, but a Nova Poshta’s depot. They hit a post office, but claimed it was a military target anyway.

Today they didn’t do a new missile strike at 11pm, so those strikes don’t seem to be that common yet, but they have done a few of them during the past week, hopefully they are not returning to their previous missile strike schedule. Daily missile strikes suck a lot. They did fly some kind of recon drones over some of our cities today, and apparently, they even launched a balloon at Dnipro? Is this some new weird trend?

>

A handful remained wounded,” said one, recalling his first assault near the village of Bilohorivka. “If one group is unsuccessful, another is sent right away.

>  
>*Deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna tells FT that Moscow is better resourced to continue the war*  
>  
>Ukraine has pleaded with its allies for ammunition and artillery “immediately”, warning it is running short of stocks to defend against a new Russian offensive that Kyiv fears is imminent.  
>  
>The demand, by deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna, came on a day when Moscow launched ballistic missiles against Ukraine’s infrastructure. It also followed a tour of western capitals by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that emphasised longer-term supplies of fighter jets and heavy weaponry.  
>  
>“What is of ultimate urgency is . . . the ammunition and the artillery that we need immediately to make sure that we can operate with the new military equipment we received,” Stefanishyna said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We do not have this amount of ammunition that we need.”  
>  
>Kyiv is preparing for an imminent large-scale attack by Russian troops as the Kremlin attempts to seize more territory in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine ahead of the first anniversary of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion later this month.  
>  
>Ukraine’s army is consuming ammunition at an unprecedented rate as it engages in punishing exchanges with Russia, prompting concerns about supplies.  
>  
>Ukraine is estimated to be firing more than 5,000 artillery rounds every day — equal to a smaller European country’s orders in an entire year in peacetime. That rate of use has put huge strain on Europe’s defence producers, compounding supply chain challenges and increasing lead times for many munitions.  
>  
>Stefanishyna, Zelenskyy’s top official for European integration, warned that the Russians were doing “everything possible to make the war continuous, lasting and exhausting”, adding that Moscow had the resources, ammunition and reserves to continue its campaign.

>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The owner of the Russian Wagner Group private military contractor actively involved in the fighting in Ukraine has predicted that the war could drag on for years.  
>  
>Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video interview released late Friday that it could take 18 months to two years for Russia to fully secure control of Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland of Donbas. He added that the war could go on for three years if Moscow decides to capture broader territories east of the Dnieper River.  
>  
>The statement from Prigozhin, a millionaire who has close links to Russian President Vladimir Putin and was dubbed “Putin’s chef” for his lucrative Kremlin catering contracts, marked a recognition of the difficulties that the Kremlin has faced in the campaign, which it initially expected to wrap up within weeks when Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.  
>  
>Russia suffered a series of humiliating setbacks in the fall when the Ukrainian military launched successful counteroffensives to reclaim broad swaths of territory in the east and the south. The Kremlin has avoided making forecasts on how long the fighting could continue, saying that what it called the “special military operation” will continue until its goals are fulfilled.

Has anyone else seen these stories about cotton linters being a bottleneck for German ammunition production? A story popped up on my feed and it looks like a rehash of some from early December. At least one of the outlets I don't trust and know nothing about the others. It contained some red flags for me such as claiming the bottleneck is because they use Chinese exports, but very little of these are exported from China and they import 70% of the world's production. Another is that it cites Douglas McGregor who has frequently been pro-Putin and his appearances are used in Russian media. A less problematic thing is that it often states the US is running out of HIMARS while other times specifying they mean GMLRS. It's odd this has creeped into my feed so I'm curious if others have seen more disinformation in their feeds recently and what the articles are about.",False,1676252312.0,t3_1106k1p,t3_1106k1p,,0,5,0,5,0,0,

The Russians said they had no idea what the Americans were talking about, they weren't their troops and didn't have any in that area.  

When the Wagner group got too close the Americans opened fire with everything the base had. They picked up radio chatter from that Wagner group to their Russian handlers (the GRU deal with Wagner).

First off Hersh's main source is the famous and well known ""anonymous source with direct knowledge"" which I personally never rate highly because it can't be verified that the person knew anything about it or even exists. But let's say you believe the source did tell Hersh the US blew up the Nordstream pipeline. For me to even remotely consider that the US did it you'd have to come up with a compelling theory as to *why* the US would do such a thing at that time and that's where the logic totally falls apart.

At the time the US wanted NATO and it's other close allies to help aid the Ukrainian government financially and with military equipment, Europe not to succumb to Russian energy blackmail and for Ukraine to show it could win the war. And when Nordstream was bombed the US had it's allies onside, the energy blackmail wasn't working and Ukraine had started to demonstrate that it could win back large areas of its territory.

So when the US is achieving all its aims why would it risk disrupting that? When someone is already winning they rarely do anything to upset the situation because they're already winning, blowing up Nordstream doesn't allow them to win any harder. In fact it only risks destabilizing the situation which has them winning. From a game theory perspective it makes little sense and goes against basic human behavior. The US didn't bomb Nordsteam because it would bring it no extra positives, in fact the act would only risk upsetting its allies and fracturing unity on Ukraine, that's the complete opposite of what the US would want.

Russia can conscript more people.  The supply isn't infinite, but still it's a lot.  What might happen is that they run out of something essential that makes them an easy target for Ukrainian forces.  For instance, they run out of anti-aircraft systems, or tanks, or artillery, or experienced soldiers, or fuel, or supply trucks.  I don't know what that'll be.  If I had to make a wild guess, I'd say they might run out of usable tanks, APCs, artillery barrels, drones, long range missiles, and/or attack helicopters.

The same is true of Ukraine; they could run out of something they need to repel Russian attacks.

A third possibility is that both sides run out of the heavy weaponry they need to capture well-defended territory, but both sides are still able to defend the land they have.  Thus the war turns into an effective stalemate.  That's probably Putin's best case scenario at this point; the war goes on for another year or two, and eventually both sides sign a kind of cease-fire and Russia keeps de-facto control of the parts of Ukraine they currently hold.

I did fencing in High School in the late 90s, and most of the people on the team took lessons at the same club. The head coaches there were a Ukrainian couple, former Soviet Olympic coaches who had defected at some point. For the younger members of the club, they ran a yearly training camp in the summer.

It was basically like a normal summer camp otherwise, and we all hung out in big dorm cabins etc. One kid had brought their N64 with them, and we had it hooked up there. This was peak Goldeneye era, of course, and we'd all play huge multiplayer games etc., although sometimes people would play the single player in their down time or whatever else.

At some point, coach comes in, stands behind watching as some of us are playing. Don't know if it was this level, but it was a similar amount of 'mowing down commies,' laughing as we do it. Now, being teenagers, we didn't have much concept of the Soviet Union vs. Russia vs. Ukraine etc. So as the coach comes in, stands behind us with his usual grim expression, we think he might be mad since we're laughing about shooting his 'countrymen.' 

Coach, in his heavy accent: 'Is Red Army?'

Someone answers: 'Yeah...'

Coach: 'Hah, hah, hah.' Then he proceeds to sit down and watch us play, lol.",False,1676258894.0,t3_1106k1p,t1_j8awmuw,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

 That said, Russia doesn't have good thermal sights anymore to equip on their tanks, even T-90s. Bradley can spot T-72 a full mile before T-72 spots Bradley (varies with atmospheric conditions) and fire its TOW guided missile first. 9/10 times, that hit from TOW will send T-72's crew into low orbit. 

&nbsp;

If you replace T-72 with a proper T-90M (not bootleg versions currently being produced) - T-90M might spot Bradley first and likely just one shot it in 4 seconds. IR blocking smoke from newer tanks is also a problem for ATGMs as they have relatively slow flight and need visibility of target to make continuous adjustments. Autocannon poses minimum threat to a well armored tank except if outflanked.

> Reconnaissance‐in‐force is a deliberate combat operation designed to discover or test the enemy’s strength, dispositions and reactions or to obtain other information (ADRP 3‐90). A reconnaissance‐in‐force is a mission that requires more protection for the scouts due to enemy direct‐fire contact that is required to test the enemy’s reactions.

> A reconnaissance‐in‐force differs from an enemy‐focused zone reconnaissance for several reasons. A reconnaissance‐in‐force is solely enemy‐focused, whereas a zone reconnaissance may focus on terrain or civil‐based PIR. The intent of a reconnaissance‐in‐force is to discover a weakness in the enemy’s formation to allow a main body to exploit the weakness. This differs from an enemy‐focused zone reconnaissance, where the intent is to determine size and location to allow the main body to conduct offensive operations.

> 5-4. The responsibility for accomplishing reconnaissance does not reside solely with reconnaissance units.
Every unit has an implied mission to report information about the terrain, civilian activities, and friendly and
enemy dispositions. [snip]

> Although all units conduct reconnaissance, **ground cavalry**,
aviation attack reconnaissance units, scouts, and special forces are specifically trained to conduct
reconnaissance operations. Some branches, such as the Corps of Engineers and Chemical Corps, conduct
specific reconnaissance operations that complement the force’s overall reconnaissance effort. However,
BCT, division, and corps commanders primarily use their organic or attached reconnaissance—ground or
air—and intelligence elements to accomplish reconnaissance.

----------

Ground Cavalry includes tanks. If you expect heavy resistance and are conducting recon-by-force, it makes sense to use a large group of tanks as recon. Why? Because tanks are heavily armored: highest survivability in case they come under fire. Furthermore, tanks are... well... cavalry. They are cars that move much faster than human legs.

If you come across superior numbers, you use your speed to run away. Tanks have speed and maneuverability. Its an expensive scout but it can perform the role.",1676219158.0,1676218709.0,t3_1106k1p,t1_j87z8m2,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

As long as both sides do not feel that the power balance has changed since the start of the conflict, then there is no reason to stop fighting.

There are some heartbreaking videos of pre-sighted Russian grad missiles raining down on 10+ Ukrainian armored vehicles and just wiping them out in seconds.

We didn't have to do that in Iraq because we had total air supremacy. Air supremacy means enemy artillery gets killed all along the front at once, enabling tank formations to slowly and carefully destroy multiple wide avenues through the minefields and *then* leap forward. Ukraine and Russia can't afford that.

Make no mistake, Ukrainian Western-donated armor will take losses for this same reason, too. There is no tank or IFV that can survive close-proximity 152mm shells and MLRS grad payloads. About 50% of all armor losses on both sides has been from artillery, not other tanks or even AT ambush squads. Artillery will continue being the king of armor casualties even after the Western-donated equipment is deployed. Ukraine's only hope is that the losses won't be so severe that their breakthroughs are blunted. Only then will the Western high-mobility armor really shine.",1676232211.0,1676232001.0,t3_1106k1p,t1_j8a2f5c,,7,4,0,4,0,0,

It’s apart of the discussion. The part where you stated “same as it’s always been…” in actuality ATGM have proven the current conflict is less on tank-on-tank battles.  I never stated that I expect Bradley’s to destroy lots of Russian tanks.  I find the optics to be more beneficial.
