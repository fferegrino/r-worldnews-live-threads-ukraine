Day 246 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day with no missile strikes, but we still had a couple of air raid alerts as usual. There was one time, at 10pm, where people were reporting about sighting a Russian drone somewhere south from Kharkiv, not sure which kind, but we haven’t heard anything new about it since then.

Apparently starting from next week we will start having rolling blackouts here in Kharkiv as well. So far they were only used in other cities, but now we will have them too. They were already being used in Kharkiv oblast, but now they will be used in the city as well, because our energy infrastructure is badly damaged.

Today Putin also did another one of his nonsensical speeches, and he’s as delusional as ever. He talked for literal hours about all the bullshit that only Russia believes in. They are the ones that invaded us and started this war, but somehow it’s “The West” that is to blame for all of this? And again with their favorite “Ukraine is an artificial country, that only exists because Russia created it.” So they are openly saying that we aren’t allowed to exist as a country, but somehow it’s us who are Nazis? I mean, I understand that Russian definition of Nazi is different from ours, but it still sounds completely absurd.

>Ramzan Kadyrov teamed up with Yevgeny Prigozhin against the generals of the Ministry of Defense

This tweet links to an article on a Russian website, which I can't link directly. I've provided the Google translation of the article:

>On October 27, Ramzan Kadyrov responded to sharp criticism of certain generals of the Ministry of Defense from the creator of Wagner PMC Yevgeny Prigozhin. The head of Chechnya supported him.

>“Dear BROTHER Prigozhin is a born warrior, his fighters are real professionals and patriots of Russia, fearless, stubborn, courageous. These are really valuable combat units. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to the assessment of just such people, to listen, to draw conclusions. They already know for sure what is right and wrong in war,” Kadyrov wrote on his Telegram channel.

>Then he turned to the personality of Colonel General Lapin and stated that he was trying to get in touch with him through his unit commanders, but nothing came of it. The head of Chechnya explained that he wanted to talk with Lapin about the recent breakthrough in the area of ​​​​the defense line of the settlements of Terny, Torskoye and Yampolovka, which the Armed Forces of Ukraine allegedly crossed without a fight.

>“For a whole day, the forces deployed there could not find Lapin’s fighters. We had to defend ourselves and then successfully move forward. At the same time, all these days, Internet resources have only been talking about the great feats of the Central Military District under the leadership of Lapin, with whom no one could even get in touch,” Kadyrov said. According to him, this situation is reminiscent of the beginning of the surrender of the Red Liman defense line.

>“Something needs to be done about this before we lose the guys and recaptured villages. As Yevgeny Viktorovich correctly noted, tactical and personnel changes are needed. Now, not tomorrow,” said Colonel-General Kadyrov.

>On the night of October 27, the press service of Yevgeny Prigozhin published his commentary, in which he criticized the military personnel of the Ministry of Defense. “Many of those who are the so-called “cadres” have learned nothing but how to click their heels, wear tsatsk and write beautiful reports,” he said and added that the “loafers” should immediately get out.",False,1666908640.0,t3_yehyoe,t3_yehyoe,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

Putin also praised Narendra Modi today.

“A lot has been done in past years under the leadership of PM Modi. Naturally he is a patriot,” Putin said, adding, “His idea to Make in India matters both economically and ethically. Future belongs to India. It can be proud of being the largest democracy and we have a special relationship. We have close ties.”

He also referred to the defence partnership and the growing trade ties. “Our trade volumes have greatly increased. PM Modi asked me to increase the supply of fertilizers to India, and there has been a 7.6 times increase in this. Trade in agriculture has almost doubled.”

The battlefield realities inside Ukraine were another determining factor. “The imperative was ‘What does Ukraine need?’ ” the Defense official said. “Not what they are asking for—what they need. And we do our own assessment of that.” The Biden Administration asked for a list of targets that the Ukrainian military wanted to strike with himars. “Every single grid point was reachable with gmlrs rather than atacms,” the Defense official said.

There was one exception: Ukraine expressed a more ambitious desire to launch missile strikes on Crimea, which Russia uses for replenishing its forces across the south and which is largely beyond the reach of gmlrs. During the war-game exercises held over the summer, when the possibility of atacms came up, it was clear that Ukraine wanted them to “lay waste to Crimea,” the Defense official said. “Putin sees Crimea as much a part of Russia as St. Petersburg. So, in terms of escalation management, we have to keep that in mind.”

In multiple conversations, U.S. officials were explicit that the himars could not be used to hit targets across the border. “The Americans said there is a very serious request that you do not use these weapons to fire on Russian territory,” the Ukrainian military official said. “We said right away that’s absolutely no problem. We’ll use them only against the enemy on the territory of Ukraine.” As with other weapons platforms, there is no technical mechanism to insure compliance. Officially, the U.S. has signalled that all Ukrainian territory illegally occupied by Russia since 2014—not only that which it has taken since February—is fair game for himars strikes. “We haven’t said specifically don’t strike Crimea,” the Defense official told me. “But then, we haven’t enabled them to do so, either.”",False,1666896734.0,t3_yehyoe,t1_iu0tatx,,1,19,0,19,0,0,

With smaller targets smaller rockets will do the job, and you get six at a time. One big blast is not going to take out six targets, and for what they need now they don't need the big blast. The really big targets, like bridges, need a far bigger blast than the ATACMS. 

So shipping more smaller rockets today makes more sense. I think outsiders are thinking of the big missiles as something will change everything, but in fact would, for now, result in fewer things getting destroyed.

What's forgotten about this is that Putin was playing both sides as well in 2016 (and still is in 2022). Russia was (and still is) funding far left AND far right groups, simply to sow chaos and partisanship. Because Trump was unexpectedly elected, people latched onto the Russian interference so that they could ignore just how deeply unpopular Obama-era policies (and Hillary Clinton personally) were with a huge swath of the US population and how Democrats spent 8 years basically ignoring any domestic issue that wasn't directly about a major metro area. Trump tapped into that, and a lot of people who voted for him did so more as a protest against Democratic party policies than as an endorsement of him personally.

But even if Trump had lost to Clinton, it still would have been a Russian ""success"" simply due to the polarization and extreme partisanship that Russian troll farms managed to inflame. I think Trump's election also made Putin think he had swayed the US election a lot more than he actually did, and that his influence there was much larger than it was.

The disingenuous nature of the answer is interesting because it allows the US to pivot at any moment in time.

The West used to think that the S300 and S400 systems could really create problems for their air forces.  There are all kinds of simulations of it floating around the web.

The reality is that a western country can simply destroy them as soon as they turn their radar on.  Ukrainian jets don't have the ability to fully use HARM's but F-16's could.  If Russia went up against western aircraft, they wouldn't have anti-aircraft defenses within a relatively short period of time.

You can probably find the article as I can't post the link here. That's kinda confirming that Russia use it as a false-flag while claiming they don't use it. 

That said, I have to point out that. Tochka-U are actually used. There are videos of Tockha-U launcher being sent with Z marking in Ukraine. I'm just saying they lie about not using them while claiming Ukraine will use them for false-flag... because they know they claim to not use them, so they can use them because they officially don't.

In the end, Russian people hear we don't use Tochka-U so it's Ukraine sending them... But why would Ukraine use a missile that only them use.. nobody ask this question.",1666885601.0,1666885289.0,t3_yehyoe,t1_iu01nii,,2,7,0,7,0,0,

Olympic (the first stage) was due to take place in November of 1945 and seize part of Kyushu.  Coronet would then have proceeded around the spring of 1946.  Two field armies would have landed around Tokyo and encircled it.  It would have made the Normandy invasion look like a quick pre game warm up.  Casualty estimates were...all over the place.  The Japanese had a good idea of the plan (there aren't many beaches that could take an massive invasion force) and they had significantly reinforced Kyushu.  The distances involved also made it incredibly challenging for Allied planners - the UK was much closer to France which made Overlord a walk in the park in comparison.  To provide cover the Allies were planning on over forty aircraft carriers and two dozen battleships.  There was also a question of how hard the Japanese civilian population would resist.  There were terrible occurences in the Pacific of civilians committing mass suicide rather than surrender to American forces.  I mean, mothers threw babies off cliffs and jumped after them.  So, there was significant concern that Allied casualties were be significant (hundreds of thousands) plus potentially millions of Japanese.  In retrospect, Japan was reeling and the submarine blockade had crushed their economy.  If Olympic had succeeded and the Allies established a beachhead on Kyushu I suspect the war would have ended.  Hirohito knew the war was lost and was looking for a way out.  But, the Supreme Council wanted to end it after a victory so that they could get better terms.  It's impossible to know where the breaking point was going to be.  One of the generals on the Supreme Council committed suicide after signing the surrender document and there was an attempted coup by some members of the army.  There are several that claim that the bombs were completely unnecessary because Japan was on the verge of surrender - but those claims are made with the benefit of a great deal of hindsight and probably inaccurate.",False,1666889050.0,t3_yehyoe,t1_iu0482i,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

>During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were two resignations in protest at the institute's dovish response to the conflict: non-resident fellow Joseph Cirincione of Ploughshares Fund, who had raised money for Quincy, and board member Paul Eaton, a retired senior Army major officer and adviser to Democratic politicians and liberal advocacy groups. Cirincione said he ""fundamentally"" disagrees with Quincy experts who ""completely ignore the dangers and the horrors of Russia’s invasion and occupation and focus almost exclusively on criticism of the United States, NATO, and Ukraine"". Eaton said he resigned because he ""supports NATO"".\[14\]\[21\] Parsi responded by saying that Cirincione's criticisms ""were not only false but bewildering,"" and were easily disproved by ""a quick glance at our website.""\[22\]

This was a policy that came on the backs of Irish people being sent to the first world war and dying in large numbers for that, and continued through the second world war, both of which many people saw or would see as ""the British empire versus ..."", which when framed in the context of Ireland being a British colony which had half its population wiped out on two separate occasions as a result of that Empire, means they weren't  really all that inclined towards either power in either war.

""We serve neither King nor Kaiser but Ireland"" - 1914.

As a new country in 1922 it had seen the madness of a recent world war where countries had fought a war that was really pretty hard to justify on either side that had grown into a world war through treaties and alliances of political convenience.

It made a choice to decide it wasn't going to be forced into losing its people that way again, and the only time they would be forced to fight was for Ireland. 

People should also be aware that the Irish military is very involved in UN peacekeeping forces, serving in Lebanon and numerous other places even when they were heated, and, when I was younger at least, even as a poor country at the time, had some of the highest per capita donation rates to international charities in the world. It's not a matter of doing nothing in the face of bad things happening.

As a Ukrainian I hard disagree. It’s been working so well that tens of thousands of Ukrainians are dead, millions are refugees, and uncounted thousands are now raped, tortured, and slaughtered by the Russian every day. It worked so well, that Ukraine now risks loosing heat and electricity, and even more homes, and even more people, because we will are not allowed to properly respond to Russia actions. 

It worked so well that Russia stole 200+ thousands of our children, and now parades and gloats at the fact. 

So no, it did not work well. 

Ukraine can win this war, and we have proven that we can do it with the right tools. Instead these tools are not being delivered, and more people suffer and die every day under Russian oppression.

But they are doing everything to lay the groundwork for that offramp, for the eventuality where their plans fail.

It is actually nowhere as stupid as it sounds. They have been saying they are at war with NATO since they started losing. It started as a ""special military operation IN Ukraine"", then their propagandists started referring to it as a ""war against Ukraine"", and now they are calling it a ""war against NATO"" and some select, particularly trustworthy propagandists have even been allowed to publicly say that NATO's military is much stronger than theirs. All this seems to be for the benefit of the domestic audience, who will have a much easier time stomaching the fact that Russia was defeated by NATO instead of Ukraine (which does not even exist as an independent state actor, according to them)

Putin literally does not have another potential off-ramp. At this point, he literally has 3 options:

(1) He can lose on the battlefield, which WILL happen, should he hesitate long enough to choose (2) or (3), because their military has lost so much hardware and so many soldiers that they will be unable to consolidate the frontline, whatever they do, let alone regain territory.

(2) He can go all out nuclear war, which he absolutely will NOT do, because contrary to popular belief, he is a rational actor, despite clinging maniacally to his power. So (2) is essentially out of the question.

(3) He can try to provoke NATO into limited intervention by false flag operations (dam, dirty bomb threats) and indiscriminate cruelty/attacks against civilian facilities, so that he can disguise their defeat as one brought about not by their incompetence, but by the meddling of a much stronger, yet, morally corrupt adversary.

 >In Slavic languages, multiple negatives affirm each other. Indeed, if a sentence contains a negated verb, any indefinite pronouns or adverbs must be used in their negative forms. For example, in the Serbo-Croatian, ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio (""Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere"") means ""Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere"", and nikad nisam tamo išao/išla (""Never I did not go there"") means ""I have never been there"". In Czech, it is nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl (""I have not seen never no-one nowhere"").

The whole push for cease fire didn’t work. Because Ukraine said it’s just gonna be used to rebuild their army. Which made sense. And Russia probably thinks winter is not in their favor with supplies. So if cease fire doesn’t work. What do you do? For a country that doesn’t care about their men dying. You try to bog the aggressive party down. You don’t have air superiority to slow them down. You are very limited on tanks and IFV. So you gotta take them into urban warfare to minimize Ukraine’s advantage. Urban fighting. Is slow. And armor is not as effective.

This is why Ukraine avoided izyum and balaklay. Surround the city. Cut off the supply. Bomb the low morale into submission or watch them run before you cut off the last road. 

One issue here I see. As stupid as Russia is. They are still an army. There is a big difference between Kherson and Izyum/Balaklai. Kherson never faced bombing. By the time Ukraine returned to izyum. It was ruins and a shell of its self. Low population of those who couldn’t flee. Because Ukraine fought for it before they gave it up to Russia. And by Russian protocol. Scorch the earth when you attack. 

Kherson was lost early due to treason. It’s fairly un touched. There are ukranian people living there still. So how could Ukraine surround it with cut it off completely. Which shouldn’t be to hard to do. But you cant bomb them inside into submission. People are there. Town isn’t devastated. Russians are cock roaches among people. If you starve them. People will die first as Russian will steal their food and destroy the people. 

That’s why I think Ukraine says it’s a hard offensive. Only thing you can hope is kill them quick and in mass numbers. Use intelligence to strike decisive and hope that low morale and poor training will force a surrender quickly.

At that point, you will diversify your supply chain based on risk and thus will not rely on a single volatile party because despite the fact they  approach you in peace time and say ""hey look what we can do and this is your savings"".

Proliferation or no proliferation, the same result can and will happen because most global leaders are rational and will not use nuclear weapons unprovoked, under threat of MAD. Same with Putin. Obviously disarmament is the ideal, but if not then full proliferation IMO could lead to a greater peace, with the only increased risk being that of technical mishaps.

Don't get me wrong, the risk of Russia using a nuclear weapon currently is slim to nil, but *if and only if* NATO does not put boots on the ground.

Since you don’t see that, I’ll break it down by each of your “legitimate concerns”

1. Nuke - Putin has 4 options as to where to use a nuke: non-occupied Ukraine, occupied Ukraine, Russia, or non-combatant country. 

The west has already, in no uncertain terms, warned them of the consequences of using a nuke of any size. But let’s say they ignore it.

If they detonate a nuke in non-occupied Ukraine, any fallout could be used as an excuse for a country like Poland to trigger Article 5. Putin knows he has no chance if that happens. 

If they detonate a nuke in occupied Ukraine, he risks his own soldiers (small concern) and risks contaminating the land he’s trying to control. 

Launching a nuke in Russia won’t accomplish anything accept guarantee he dies. 

The last option is a non-combatant country. I don’t think I need to explain the stupidity of that. 

2. Nuclear incident - Using conventional weapons to create a nuclear incident would risk the same consequences as detonating a nuclear bomb. Specifically article 5. 

3. Dirty Bomb - A lot of the risks are the same as using a nuke except it lacks the same ability to cause fear that a nuke does and is relatively low impact. In other words, high risk and low reward. 

4. The dam - This is the most realistic of the bunch, I’ll grant you that but Putin ultimately wants to at least keep Crimea. Destroying the dam makes that difficult.",False,1666927119.0,t3_yehyoe,t1_iu2s6sq,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

And countries choose to join NATO. NATO doesn’t force anyone to join. A sovereign nation can join any organization they choose. Why should Russia have a say in that?

Also, NATO didn’t force Russia to do shit. Putin decided to invade Crimea in 2014 for the warm weather ports and resources. He chose to invade this time because he wanted the non-renewable resources that Ukraine has that they recently discovered.",False,1666928897.0,t3_yehyoe,t1_iu2weqc,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Midterms are happening and nothing is going to stop Ukraine from being supplied. 

> Or a massive global recession coming where people won't be able to focus just on Ukraine.

Even if there is a massive recession the US has enough military equipment to supply Ukraine for as long as needed. Not to mention a huge chunk of our budget is spent on defense. This means more money in our economy. There is nothing preventing us from keeping supplies to Ukraine flowing. Even if Republicans win the midterm, there’s already legislation passed that gives Biden a huge amount of money to use support Ukraine.

Yes. Because Russia invaded Ukraine. Had Russia not invaded Ukraine, it wouldn’t be an issue. And that’s just admitting that Russia invade Ukraine for the natural resources. Not because they feared NATO.
