Day 69 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet around my area, but air raid alerts were active for hours at a time, actually one started just now as I‚Äôm writing this. Also some good news is that today it was confirmed that Molodova village was liberated, and that means Staryi Saltiv could be next.

Gorky Park was shelled again today, that‚Äôs a nice military target they got here, those children rides had it coming and were successfully demilitarized. A football stadium near the park was also denazified during that same shelling. Thankfully nobody died, though one person was wounded.

It was funny reading that today Russia doubled down and said that Israel supports neo-Nazis and then that made Israel reconsider sending us military aid. What is Russia even doing? They are literally shooting themselves in the foot. I mean I‚Äôm not complaining, they are helping us by acting like this, but this is literally self-sabotage, do they not want to win or something?

What the hell is this? They are not even talking about Ukrainians. That‚Äôs what they want to do that to their own citizens that oppose the war. Are they in some sort of competition on who can come up with the most evil thing imaginable? It‚Äôs like we are watching some badly written villains, but the problem is that they are actually real.

‚ö°Ô∏è The main thing is from the President's address

 ‚û°Ô∏è The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end.  68th day of self-destruction of Russia.  Self-destruction in every sense of the word.  If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy.

 ‚û°Ô∏è Yesterday, for example, the Russian Foreign Minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites are allegedly among the Jews themselves.  And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood.  How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism?  These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes.  No words.

 ‚û°Ô∏è Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel about these words today.  However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow.  There is silence.  So, they agree with what their foreign minister said.  After the Russian rocket attack on Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass shootings in Drobitsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps, such an anti-Semitic attack on their minister means  Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  So the question is, will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow, knowing their new position?  Will relations with Russia remain as usual?  Because it's not accidental.  It is no coincidence that the Russian Foreign Minister is a ""great connoisseur of Hitlerism.""

‚û°Ô∏è Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike on Odessa.  Destroyed the dormitory.  A 14-year-old boy was killed.  A 17-year-old girl was wounded and had a shrapnel wound.  What is it anyway?  For what?  What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with?  And that's how they fight.  That's all.

 ‚û°Ô∏è In Lysychansk, Luhansk region, a gymnasium, which was over a hundred years old, burned down due to Russian shelling.  It was built by the Belgians for this city.  She survived two world wars.  But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia.

 ‚û°Ô∏è 220 Ukrainian children killed by the Russian army since February 24.  And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state.  1,570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling.  It's a little over two months!

 ‚û°Ô∏è Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.  They discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation.  I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark.

 ‚û°Ô∏è We are working on new sanctions against Russia.  We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future.  This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues.  We believe in this very much.  That the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel.

 ‚û°Ô∏è We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol.  The evacuation operation continues.  Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka.

 ‚û°Ô∏è I just signed a big decree on rewarding our military.  438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards.

 ‚û°Ô∏è The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to senior lieutenant Todorov Dmytro Ruslanovych for personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region.

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy and Tim Lister

Ukrainian military strikes, captured on drone footage, destroyed a number of Russian military vehicles in the village of Sulyhivka ‚Äî about 11 miles or 18 kilometers ‚Äî south of Izium in the Kharkiv oblast.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the footage, which was first uploaded to Telegram on Monday. When the footage was taken is unclear.

However, in two situation updates posted to Telegram on Saturday, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Kharkiv regional military administrator Oleg Sinegubov noted that Russian forces had tried to advance near the village.

Both said that Ukrainian forces had repelled the Russian assault, but Sinegubov claimed the Russians had sustained heavy losses.

There's been heavy fighting in the area for several weeks, as Ukrainian forces try to resist a large armored offensive from the Izium area south and west towards Sloviansk.

Israel has reacted with fury after Russia's foreign minister claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ""had Jewish blood"".

Sergei Lavrov made the comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish.

Israel's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and¬†demanded an apology.

The comments have been condemned across the political spectrum in Israel and by newspapers in the country.

In an analysis piece, the¬†Jerusalem Post¬†said it meant Israel could no longer be neutral on the war in Ukraine.

Jerusalem‚Äôs best-laid plans to ""somehow stay above the war"" have now been undone, it says.

Another Israeli newspaper,¬†Haaretz, carries comments¬†from the American Jewish Committee saying: ""We‚Äôve repeatedly said denazification is needed - in Moscow, not Kyiv.

""Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, one of Putin‚Äôs enablers-in-chief, makes clear why. His statement is grotesque.""

Good news everybody!  This is a GLORIOUS day for doomscrollers rooting for Ukraine.   Yesterday we got [firsthand reports](https://twitter.com/blacksmithVakul/status/1521035557794684928) that Staryu Saltiv was liberated by Ukraine.  This is hugely important because it indicates the russian position around Kharkiv has collapsed as [indicated by the muted silence on the russian telegram channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ugq1y4/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i723w3a/).

In addition to being great news to our boy /u/SaberFlux this means the russian supply lines to Izyum are under continuous Ukrainian threat so that great pincer in Donetsk has little chance of advancing further.

Speaking of Donetsk, it was reported today that [US Howitzers are now seeing action in battle](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1521511830644043776) and is reflected in recent, notable upticks in destroyed russian artillery (US artillery has longer range and counter artillery radar).

Between the new supply line woes to izyum, the new US artillery, and the recent attack on russian command and control in Izyum on Sunday, don't expect any great russian advances here and existing hot spots like Lyman to shift again to Ukrainian hands.

We see continued incremental gains by Ukraine in Kherson and the fear an gnashing of teeth over the Transnistria situation seems to be pestering out (like maybe russia decided its a bad idea).

Finally, though no one but the odd tweeters seem to have picked it up, [the US Military briefing today](https://twitter.com/deptofdefense/status/1521490170398359555) had the US Military telling congress the war should be wrapped up in a few weeks. 

#THAT IS FRIGING EXTRAORDINARY

All in all, in all the little bits and pieces of the live thread, its a glorious day to be Ukraine or its ally, but not so much for russia.

In the drone video, there are a number of smoldering Russian military vehicles.

In a Sunday briefing posted on Telegram, the Ukraine Armed Forces said Russian forces were moving south from the Kharkiv oblast and into Oleksandrivka.

According to briefing, the Russians were attempting to advance on Lyman, a strategic and heavily contested city just south of the village.

In recent weeks, the Russian military has conducted repeated military strikes on Lyman, including on its railroad infrastructure.

The Russian Ministry of Defense also admitted to military activity near Oleksandrivka, saying in a Monday briefing posted to Telegram that they targeted the area around the village with missiles.

> Russian troops have also reached the outskirts of the town of Oleksandrivka on the Donetsk/Kharkiv border, however, they are being heavily contested with many destroyed vehicles, and they do not appear to currently control the town.

The request, if enacted, would allow Russians with a masters or doctoral degree in the fields of science, technology, engineering or math to apply for a visa without first obtaining an employer sponsor in the US.¬†

The amendment would also require the Department of Homeland Security ‚Äúto expedite consideration of such applications,‚Äù the document says, ‚Äúas appropriate‚Äù and with the necessary vetting.¬†

The administration explained in the document that the authority ‚Äúwould help the U.S. attract and retain Russian STEM talent and undercut Russia‚Äôs innovative potential, benefitting U.S. national security.‚Äù The authority would expire four years after the date that it is enacted, according to the document.¬†",False,1651627914.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,36,0,36,0,0,

Ukraine's outspoken ambassador in Berlin has sharply criticised Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz for not yet visiting Kyiv in a show of support, unlike a number of other European leaders.  
  
Scholz indicated on Monday night that he wouldn't visit the Ukrainian capital until German President Frank-Walter Steinmeiner had gone there.  
  
Ukraine rejected the offer of a visit from Steinmeier last month, in what was widely seen at the time as a snub.  
  
""Acting like a sulky liver sausage doesn't sound very statesmanlike,"" Ukrainian ambassador Andriy Melnyk told the German press agency. ""This is about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine - it's no kindergarten.""  
  
Melnyk has ruffled feathers in Germany, repeatedly criticising the chancellor's centre-left Social Democrats for years of close ties to Russia.  
  
Scholz denied responding hesitantly to Russia's invasion: ""I've always made quick decisions, in tandem with everyone else... but my line is that we act in a level-headed and prudent manner.""",False,1651569876.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,21,0,21,0,0,

**'This is your finest hour': UK PM to address Ukraine's parliament**

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to describe Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion as the country's ""finest hour"" when he address its parliament virtually on Tuesday.  
  
Johnson is set to say that the UK Parliament met throughout World War Two, just as Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada has done through the war with Russia, and that the British people showed ""such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour"".  
  
""This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come,"" he will say.  
  
Johnson will also announce a ¬£300m package in extra military support, which will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter-battery radar system, GPS jammers and night-vision devices.

Propaganda, even when you know it is wrong information, is still very dangerous.

Basically, exposure increases your familiarity to the statements unconsciously. You can't consciously form a source memory every time to remember that the statement is incorrect. You seek meaning for this increase in familiarity (aka fluency in processing) and often attribute the statement as being true due to its cognitive ease in processing.

This is how propaganda tries and at times succeed to convince people of some absurd ideas. 

This time is Ukraine being a nazi country, but back to Hitler times there was another incredible idea that many believed despite all evidence were in front of them.

Nazis tried their best to spread the concept that they were the superior race and then they explained how the real Aryan men were supposed to look like. 

Blonde, tall, blue eyes, great fit etc. And while they succeeded to sell this idea, many among those that were selling it were in fact drastically far that specific description.

If we look at Hitler (*no need to post a photo*), then [Goebbels](https://storiasegreta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/goebbels.jpg), [Himmler](https://www.rai.it/resizegd/1024x768/dl/img/2016/08/1470151590773.GettyImages_3375528.jpg), [Rufolf Hess](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1987-0313-507%2C_Rudolf_Hess.jpg/206px-Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1987-0313-507%2C_Rudolf_Hess.jpg) to name some of the most famous, all of them fail to match the basic look of how the superior Aryan man was supposed to be. 

And if we check lists of Nazis involved in Aryan propaganda and then in the Holocaust most of them were nowhere close to the absurd standards they had set for everyone else.

So that blatant lie in the core of that propaganda was right there in front of everybody's eyes and yet it worked for years.

So this is a reminder that it doesn't matter how absurd some claims will be, it's always important to call out such type of bullshit talk and never make the mistake of taking for granted that people would never take the bait for such nonsense. Because many in fact will take the bait as it happened 80 years go and as it's happening now.",False,1651609885.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

Nothing triggers fear quite like the prospect of a world ending nuclear exchange, but that doesn't make the hype true. While we can't relax entirely (the risk isn't zero), I think we can afford to stop hyping the risk of WWIII quite so much, at least for now. So if you'd like some reverse clickbait where I explain why you probably shouldn't be that afraid, let's get into it.  


  
In this video, I take a look at what Russia's been doing that has caused so much concern around the world, both in terms of demonstrating new weapons and issuing warnings and threats.

Over time, the group keeps making their ideas more and more extreme, as each level of extremism is becoming normal to them, and they want to push the boat out further so that they can be the one who came up with the idea.

On top of THAT, it can tell every single piece of ordinance in the US military RIGHT where you are, and give them a firing solution.  Which means the US now has about a dozen different ways to turn you into confetti.

Further, it can apparently control unmanned aircraft, which the US is definitely totally still working on, they're not ready, no please ignore that we turned an f-15 into a drone several years ago it's definitely just for target practice.

This means the F-35 can legit sit there, invisible, and hurl flocks of gen 4/4+ fighters literally armed to the tits with missiles at you while it sits out of range giggling.

I said she [Astrid] would've wanted it because she'd enjoyed the company. My old mothers eyes lit up like a humans only can when remembering something with pure love. 

""Oh yes, she'd loved that. She'd strike a conversation."" She said, beaming in her smile in the spring sun.

Based on the past it wasn't foolish. He's had airplanes shot down, took land in Georgia, poisons journalists, poisons political opponents, took Crimea, funds western elections for far right candidates, floods the West with social media propaganda, and more shit I can't remember. His consequences for all of this were slaps on the wrist. His consequence for helping trump win was the undoing of sanctions and a potential dissolution of NATO. Why would invading Ukraine be different? 

Even at the very beginning of this war, the west was hesitant to sanction him. No one wanted to disrupt oil supplies or piss off oligarchs bringing funds to their nation. Zelensky had to beg, plead, and even shame the west for support.",False,1651594419.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i769c50,,1,11,0,11,0,0,

This was a HUGE mistake thats been replicated in most if not all russian tanks variants. Heres why: If the turret of the tank gets too hot from a heat round, fire nade, etc; it can cause the ammo stored in the turret to ""cook off"" meaning explode, and cause the turret to be complete blown off the top of the tank. US DoD officials have labbeled this flaw ""Jack in the box"". Its given ukraine a strategy when targetting the newer russian tanks. If you can set fire right below the turret you could cause the entire tank to explode.

They won't run out of ammunition anytime soon. Gas and rations are dirt cheap. Extra pay, paying the families of dead soldiers etc. is negligible in the grand scheme of things. Russia can sustain this war for a long time materially, the bottleneck are soldiers willing to die.

On the next level we are talking about restocking what is being used and destroyed right now. That cost is significantly higher, but it's a future cost. It includes lost revenue for weapon sales to foreign countries, because Russia has to restock first. There's also training to replace dead soldiers and so on. Here we are easily talking about many many billions and probably multiple years of their military budget when all is said and done, just to get back to the level before the war.

They invaded Georgia and they've annexed parts of Ukraine already and the response was nothing at all like what we are seeing today. They've been manipulating people in these regions to regain support in order to get the support of these countries (Belarus, as one example) since they lost them. They just want friends. 

The shock (to Russian and quite honestly, me too) is that this was the straw that broke the world's back. This one hit different. I doubt they saw the global response to this when it was not there in the past, but surely they had to know they'd hit a do not cross line at some point, right?

A minority party with unpopular policy stances needs a way to ""scam"" people into voting for them. 

So they scapegoat women, gays, minorities, and members of the other political parties. They grab the attention of idiots and lunatic fringe haters, and glom them all together in hopes that they'll get their collection of minorities (by political persuasion) to out-number the collection of minorities getting targeted.  (in the case of misogynists, you've got to convince enough women who are afraid of ""other races"" to vote alongside the men who are voting for anti-women policies. And this works fine, and is relatively easy: as long as you control the loudest media voices). 

This culture-war game works; but it takes a little time, and once you're in power you've fear-mongered enough to your little base of deplorables, that  they're terrified they'll 'lose-power' (and that they'll be treated the way they treat other minorities) so they embrace authoritarianism and fascism.

From there, it just escalates, because this former minority party now needs to use modern media tools as weapons to keep power. This propaganda spreads their message of hate, until a certain critical mass of haters is reached. Then they're basically forced to do what the angry mob wants.

The worst problem is that we've seen this happen over and over again in history (and the same process works even in non-democracies, or fake democracies; you still need to manufacture consent to some degree).

+ .30-06 Springfield in US manufactured Garand and Springfield rifles

+ .303 in the British and British Empire Lee-Enfield rifles (and related rifles like the Lee-Metford used by some empire forces) which wasn't necessarily compatible due to different pressures between versions of .303 in different arsenals.

Sure it may seem like piecemeals but all added together is a pretty fine amount. 

Their benefit is that the western artillery is fast to setup, deploy and pack up to leave. This makes their survivability much larger.  
Western artillery also gives Ukraine the ability to utilize NATO standard munitions. Like guided munitions and air-burst munitions. 

Add to the fact that western artillery is far more precise on longer ranges.

And Ukraine is pretty capable of Shoot and Scoot strategy.

This all leads to Ukraine being capable of using these artillery pieces, keeping them alive for long and utilizing them in counter-artillery attacks.

It wouldn't be a 100% check but most likely a check for any indications of mined areas.

Clearing actual mined areas takes a LOT of manpower and time. I suspect that we'll hear stories of occasional deaths/injuries from UXOs or mines for years.

The plus side is that the longer an enemy force is in position, the more opportunities they get to setup mine fields. Russia wasn't there very long (in the grand scheme of things).

UXO would be my biggest pick for ongoing issues, just based on the general reporting we've seen; not many mine fields but lots of artillery/other munitions and we know Russia has maintenance and quality issues.

UXO is worse in a way; usually bigger bang and often in more habitable areas. Standard process is to blow in place, which means more shit to clean-up and rebuild if in urban environments (common - as that's usually where the targets are).

Catherine Belton, Greg Miller
14-18 minutes

In the two months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the silence ‚Äî and even acquiescence ‚Äî of the Russian elite has started to fray.

Even as opinion polls report overwhelming public support for the military campaign, amid pervasive state propaganda and new laws outlawing criticism of the war, cracks are starting to show. The dividing lines among factions of the Russian economic elite are becoming more marked, and some of the tycoons ‚Äî especially those who made their fortunes before President Vladimir Putin came to power ‚Äî have begun, tentatively, to speak.

For many, the most immediate focus has been their own woes. Sweeping sanctions imposed by the West have brought down a new iron curtain on the Russian economy, freezing tens of billions of dollars of many of the tycoons‚Äô assets along the way.

‚ÄúIn one day, they destroyed what was built over many years. It‚Äôs a catastrophe,‚Äù said one businessman who was summoned along with many of the country‚Äôs other richest men to meet Putin on the day of the invasion.
In response to Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, the West sanctioned some of his closest advisers. (Video: Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)

The White House further turned the screws on the oligarchs Thursday, announcing a proposal to liquidate their assets and donate the proceeds to Ukraine.

At least four oligarchs who made it big in the more liberal era of Putin‚Äôs predecessor, President Boris Yeltsin, have left Russia. At least four senior officials have resigned their posts and departed the country, the highest ranking among them being Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin special envoy for sustainable development and Yeltsin-era privatization czar.

But those in top positions vital to the continued running of the country remain ‚Äî some trapped, unable to leave even if they wanted to. Most notably, Russia‚Äôs mild-mannered and highly regarded central bank chief, Elvira Nabiullina, tendered her resignation after the imposition of Western sanctions, but Putin refused to let her step down, according to five people familiar with the situation.

In interviews, several Russian billionaires, senior bankers, a senior official and former officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, described how they and others had been blindsided by their increasingly isolated president and feel largely impotent to influence him because his inner circle is dominated by a handful of hard-line security officials.

The complaints aired in public so far are mostly muted and focused primarily on the government‚Äôs proposed economic response to the sanctions imposed on Russia by the West. No one has directly criticized Putin.

Vladimir Lisin, a steel magnate who made his fortune in the Yeltsin years, slammed a proposal in the Russian parliament to counter sanctions by forcing foreign buyers to pay in rubles for a list of commodities beyond gas. In an interview with a Moscow newspaper, he said the measure risked undermining export markets that Russia ‚Äúfought for for decades,‚Äù warning that ‚Äúa transfer to payments in rubles will just lead to us being thrown out of international markets.‚Äù

Vladimir Potanin, the owner of the Norilsk Nickel metals plant who was an architect of Russia‚Äôs privatizations in the 1990s, warned that proposals to confiscate the assets of foreign companies that exited Russia in the wake of the war would destroy investor confidence and throw the country back to the revolution of 1917.

Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum tycoon who also made his initial fortune during the Yeltsin era, has gone furthest, calling the war in Ukraine ‚Äúinsanity,‚Äù though he too has focused on the invasion‚Äôs economic toll. He has predicted that the economic crisis resulting from the sanctions would be three times worse than the 1998 financial crisis that rocked the Russian economy, and he has thrown down the gauntlet to the Putin regime, saying its state capitalism policies of the past 14 years have ‚Äúled neither to economic growth nor to the growth of the population‚Äôs incomes.‚Äù

In a subsequent post on his Telegram channel, Deripaska wrote that the current ‚Äúarmed conflict‚Äù was ‚Äúa madness for which we will long be ashamed of.‚Äù In the next sentence, however, he indicated the West was equally to blame for a ‚Äúhellish ideological mobilization from all sides.‚Äù

‚ÄòWe‚Äôve lost everything‚Äô

When 37 of Russia‚Äôs wealthiest business executives were called to the Kremlin for the meeting with Putin hours after he launched the war on Feb. 24, many of them were depressed and shocked. ‚ÄúEveryone was in a terrible mood,‚Äù one participant said. ‚ÄúEveryone was sitting there crushed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd never seen them as stunned as they were,‚Äù another participant said. ‚ÄúSome of them could not even speak.‚Äù

They‚Äôd been kept waiting, as usual, for more than two hours before the president appeared in the Kremlin‚Äôs ornate Ekaterininsky Hall ‚Äî ample time to consider their fate. For some of the executives, as they quietly discussed the consequences of Putin‚Äôs war, it was the moment they realized that it was all over for the business empires they‚Äôd been building since Russia‚Äôs market transition began more than 30 years ago.

‚ÄúSome of them said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve lost everything,‚Äô ‚Äù one of the participants said.

When the president arrived, no one dared issue a whimper of protest. Stone-faced, they listened as Putin assured everyone Russia would remain part of global markets ‚Äî a promise soon made hollow by the series of Western sanctions ‚Äî and told them he‚Äôd had no other choice than to launch his ‚Äúspecial military operation.‚Äù

Since then, Putin has ratcheted up threats against anyone criticizing the war, hastily issuing new laws that include a potential 15-year prison sentence for anyone saying anything the Kremlin deems false about the Russian military. His administration has proposed instituting a new system of deputies in Russia‚Äôs ministries to report back to the Kremlin on the ‚Äúemotional climate and mood.‚Äù One tycoon said he expected the coming crackdown to be ‚Äúcannibalistic‚Äù compared with the ‚Äúvegetarian period‚Äù of previous years.",False,1651593697.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i769v02,,2,17,0,17,0,0,

Bullets fly out of a cannon without any propulsion of their own. This means that the bullets fly in a parabolic arc.

Do a little bit of math (ex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_arch), and if you know 2 points of a parabola, you know **all** point of the parabola... including the ""origin"" (where the gun is located). Of course, 2-points is the minimum, having 3, 4, 5, 10, or 20 measurements helps accuracy (assuming each ""measurement"" has +/- error involved, additional measurements increase accuracy)

That's it. So you watch the bullet for a few seconds using RADAR, and then you know where the bullet came from. Those artillery cannons are only traveling at ~1000 mph (Mach 1.5 or so)

 >In 1994, the personal letters of the Swedish fascist Per Engdahl were made public, posthumously revealing that Kamprad had joined Engdahl's pro-fascist New Swedish Movement (Nysvenska R√∂relsen) in 1942, at age 16. Kamprad had raised funds and recruited members for the group, at least as late as September 1945. When he quit the group is unknown, but he remained a friend of Engdahl until the early 1950s. Kamprad devoted two chapters to his time in Nysvenska R√∂relsen in his book Leading by Design: The IKEA Story and, in a 1994 letter to IKEA employees, called his affiliation with the organization the ""greatest mistake of my life"".

2) Even with a formal end to the war, Ukraine is going to need to establish a powerful defensive barrier along their border with Russia. Russia can't be trusted not to try this again. I expect we're going to fund most of that until Ukraine gets back on its feet again.

3) Military equipment/training is expensive. If the aid expands into things like F-16s and lots of modern NATO-grade equipment, money is going vanish like water in a desert.

While this is true, it should be noted that ammunition (at least for small arms) is generally expected to have a shelf-life of about 10 years. You can extend that with proper storage and such, of course, but one must wonder if Russia is a great caretaker of its own gear.

This isn't meant as a counter to your statement, rather a more nuanced take on Russia's ammunition capacity. Whatever they have stockpiled is likely really old and unreliable. It might not seem like much if 3% of small arms ammo ""goes bad"" but consider that's potentially 1 round in every magazine for a soldier's rifle. The most common result will require the soldier to be clearing jams with every magazine, but there's also the real risk of squib loads which can be catastrophic if not recognized and addressed immediately (aka, before pulling the trigger again).

I don't do as much shooting as I used to but I know people always hated the Eastern European ammo because it was all poorly made and dirty (as in how it burns.)

 >A kinetic bombardment or a kinetic orbital strike is the hypothetical act of attacking a planetary surface with an inert projectile from orbit (orbital bombardment), where the destructive power comes from the kinetic energy of the projectile impacting at very high speeds. The concept originated during the Cold War. Typical depictions of the tactic are of a satellite containing a magazine of tungsten rods and a directional thrust system. When a strike is ordered, the launch vehicle brakes one of the rods out of its orbit and into a suborbital trajectory that intersects the target.

‚ÄúApart from those directly involved in the preparations, [Defense Minister Sergei] Shoigu, [chief of the army‚Äôs general staff Valery] Gerasimov, and some from the FSB, no one knew,‚Äù said one of the billionaires.

Despite the escalating warnings by U.S. intelligence, many in the Moscow elite had believed Putin was limiting his aims to the separatist areas of eastern Ukraine. Economic and financial officials ‚Äúthought it would be limited to action in Donetsk and Luhansk and this is what they had prepared for,‚Äù the senior official said. They had prepared for Western sanctions, including a suspension from Swift, the international financial messaging system, he said, ‚Äúbut they hadn‚Äôt prepared for this.‚Äù

With casualties mounting and Russian troops forced to turn back from Kyiv, the war is now being viewed with increasing dismay not just by billionaires sanctioned by the West but even by some members of the security establishment, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.

One referred specifically to Shoigu, who took part in the war preparations. ‚ÄúThey all want to have a normal life. They have homes, children, grandchildren. They don‚Äôt need war,‚Äù this person said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all not suicidal. They all want to have a good life. They want their children to have everything and be able to travel to the most beautiful places.‚Äù

The mounting pressure on their foreign bank accounts is a source of particular chagrin for the elite. Even officials who tried to protect themselves by moving their money into accounts belonging to business partners now find that these accounts are blocked, one of the Moscow executives said.

Trapped in Moscow

Western sanctions to freeze $300 billion ‚Äî or nearly half ‚Äî of the Central Bank of Russia‚Äôs hard currency reserves left Moscow reeling, including central bank governor Nabiullina, whose resignation attempt was rejected by Putin, according to the five people familiar with the situation. (Bloomberg News first reported her attempt to resign.)

Nabiullina ‚Äúunderstands very well she can‚Äôt just leave. Otherwise, it will end very badly for her,‚Äù one of these people said.

‚ÄúNo one can say ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it‚Äô and then slam the door,‚Äù said Vadim Belyaev, the exiled former main owner of Otkritie, Russia‚Äôs biggest private bank until its takeover by the state in 2017. ‚ÄúEveryone will continue working right up to the next Hague tribunal,‚Äù he said, referring to a possible war crimes trial. The central bank has denied that Nabiullina tried to resign.

Only those officials who are superfluous to the running of the state ‚Äî and are relative outsiders ‚Äî have been allowed to leave, economists said. ‚ÄúNo minister is allowed to step down,‚Äù said Maxim Mironov, an associate professor at IE University in Spain. ‚ÄúIt is like a mafia.‚Äù

If Nabiullina epitomizes Moscow‚Äôs senior technocratic officials, then Alexei Kudrin is the one closest to Putin. Kudrin ‚Äî a former member of Putin‚Äôs inner circle from St. Petersburg who served as finance minister for the first two terms of his presidency ‚Äî also appears to be among those unable to step down.

One person close to Kudrin said he met with Putin a month before the invasion. Although it was clear that preparations for war were underway, Kudrin had believed the plans would not be carried out, one person familiar with his thinking said. ‚ÄúHe counted on things not reaching such a head,‚Äù the person said.

Kudrin ‚Äî who now heads the Audit Chamber, Russia‚Äôs financial watchdog ‚Äî has told allies it would be a betrayal by him to leave for good. He‚Äôd appeared in Tel Aviv the weekend of April 9 but took to social media to telegraph to all that he intended to return to Moscow to speak at Russia‚Äôs upper chamber the following week. He gave his address according to plan, warning that Western sanctions were confronting Russia with the worst economic downturn in 30 years.

Another former senior state official said he felt a responsibility to remain in Moscow, even though he was taken aback and horrified by the war. ‚ÄúIf everyone leaves, then who is going to be here to pick up the pieces,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like working at a nuclear power station. Who is going to run it if you leave? If you leave, then there is a chance it can explode.‚Äù

Yeltsin‚Äôs tycoons and Putin‚Äôs tycoons

Among the billionaires who left Russia in the immediate aftermath of the invasion are several who grew wealthy during the Yeltsin era, including Alexander Mamut and Alexander Nesis, who own the Russian gold company Polymetal, and Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven of Alfa Group.

But many other tycoons high-tailed it to Moscow as soon as they were hit with sanctions, which have barred them from travel in the West. Other business executives fear that if they leave Russia, their companies will be seized by the government, one of the Moscow business executives said.

Some of the billionaires now stuck in Moscow are seeking only to emerge unscathed. ‚ÄúYou may not support the war but you have to keep quiet and be with your countrymen because some of your soldiers are dying,‚Äù said one person close to one of the billionaires present at the Feb. 24 Kremlin meeting. ‚ÄúIf you are living in the country, you may not be happy ‚Äî nobody is happy about what‚Äôs going on ‚Äî but don‚Äôt voice your opinion.‚Äù

Those billionaires who have been willing to speak out publicly are those who remember a different era; they made their first fortunes in the Yeltsin years, before Putin became president.

Sergei Pugachev, a Kremlin insider until he left Russia in 2011, pointed out that these tycoons were still careful in their public comments not to directly criticize Putin for going to war. ‚ÄúWhat they say is subtle: The context is that the West, NATO is to blame. ‚Ä¶ They are talking about this as though it is a conspiracy against Russia,‚Äù he said.

By contrast, those closest to Putin ‚Äî who are from St. Petersburg and became fabulously wealthy after his rise to the presidency ‚Äî such as Gennady Timchenko, Yury Kovalchuk and Arkady Rotenburg, are resolutely silent. They ‚Äúwould never go against Putin. They started with Putin, and he made them gazillionaires. Why would you bite the hand that feeds you?‚Äù said a former senior Western banker who worked with Russian oligarchs.

Apart from these tycoons, there is an army of officials and business executives in Moscow who are not troubled by Russia‚Äôs increasing economic isolation as a result of the invasion, Pugachev said, and many of the contacts he retains in Moscow have not faulted Putin for going to war. They have complained instead that the army should have been better prepared.

He said many members of the current elite are mid-level government ministers who have stashed millions of dollars in private accounts and maintain homes elsewhere in Europe. If sanctions prevent them from traveling to these countries, they‚Äôll still be fine. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still a minister in Russia, and instead of going to Austria, he‚Äôll go to [the Russian resort] Sochi. They don‚Äôt suffer very much,‚Äù Pugachev said.

On the surface, moreover, the Russian economy has appeared to stabilize since the initial salvo of sanctions, buoyed by estimated revenue of more than $800 million a day from the sale of oil and gas to Europe. The central bank‚Äôs policy to force exporters to sell 80 percent of their hard-currency earnings has prevented a ruble implosion, while Putin has declared that the ‚Äúeconomic blitzkrieg‚Äù against Russia has failed.

But earlier this month, Nabiullina warned the impact of sanctions was yet to be fully felt and said the worst was still to come. The manufacturing plants, where ‚Äúpractically every product‚Äù depended on imported components, were beginning to run out of supplies, while reserves of imported consumer goods were dwindling, too. ‚ÄúWe are entering a difficult period of structural changes,‚Äù she told parliamentary deputies. ‚ÄúThe period during which the economy can live on reserves is finite.‚Äù

In these conditions, Putin‚Äôs position is precarious, Pugachev said. The population has so far been lulled by the state propaganda machine, which has covered up the level of deaths in the Russian military, as well as by the sanctions‚Äô lack of immediate bite. ‚ÄúBut in three months, the shops and factories will run out of stocks, and the scale of deaths in the Russian military will become clear,‚Äù he said.

Despite the near-fatal blow to their interests, for now, the Russian business elite appears to be still frozen in fear. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who has the balls to fight back,‚Äù said one of the business executives.

‚ÄúBut if the war is long, and they begin to lose, then the chances will be greater,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere will be a serious battle for Donbas and, if it is not successful, then there will be a big battle inside Russia‚Äù among elites.",False,1651593717.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i76aopr,,3,13,0,13,0,0,

I very much doubt that Russia has supplies stretching back much further than WW2 era kit, because everything older was basically trashed during 1941. I also doubt they're actual muskets rather than rifles, as literally anything is better than these, as they don't even take cartridges but powder and shot, and few outside of collections are in serviceable condition.

More likely, is if you were to be talking about the direct precursor to the original ""long"" 1891 Mosin-Nagant, the 1870 Berdan. They existed in civilian hands and were produced as sporting rifles into the early 20th Century. If so, then where is the ammunition coming from? The Berdan is chambered in a cartridge that hasn't been mass produced in almost a century. Hand-loaded, maybe, but not in the quantities that would make it a viable military issue weapon.

Possibly these are ""personal"" hunting weapons of separatist fighters, but as far as I'm aware Russia's stocks go back to WW2 and no further, and they have more MN91/30s than they have people able to actually fight in this war. 

Alternatively, what you've seen are photos of recruits with what are called *drill purpose rifles*, i.e. they aren't meant for shooting, but for exercises, training, and display - many armies use substantially older rifles for this because they look nice in a ceremonial setting. The US, for example, still drills with Garands, Springfields, and wood-stock (rather than polymer) M14s.

There are some obvious ways Ukraine could give Russia a stronger strategic position.  Ukraine has multiple ports.  A large part of the city of Sevastopol is employed by the naval base.  Most of the people living there think they are Russians.  The few people in Sevastopol who would prefer to be Ukrainian are certainly not going to be in favor of Ukraine leveling everything while evicting the Russians.  For NATO especially Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania there is a strategic advantage to not having Russian navy in Sevastopol.  It is a small piece of real estate.  Northern Crimea can be used to launch invasions of Ukraine but the peninsula is hourglass shaped. There is room for compromise.

Hard to say how central to Russian motives the petroleum reserves are.  Russia does not need Ukraine's gas.  They just want a monopoly.  No capital has been spent developing Ukraine's gas fields.  Ukraine could agree to not develop them for a few decades or a century.  Perhaps agree to only sell to Russia.  My preference for keeping gas in the ground is entirely environment and not originating from this war.  USA (my government) is clearly going to push for drilling.  The goal will be to get Ukraine to sell gas to Europe and then use all the revenue buying weapons from USA.  You will not hear that in a POTUS speech but that asshole also campaigned on a pro-environment ""climate change is real"" platform.  Trust is low now.

Your own words ""deal with Russia"".  Sometimes that is the same as ""keeping Ukraine free and safe"".  However they are not always exactly the same.

---------

Russian forces appear to be unable to conduct effective combined-arms warfare. Alone, tanks have tunnel vision (tanks have night-vision / thermal vision and telescopes... but can only see well in a very, very narrow range). Tanks require infantry support to find the enemy and ""where to focus"" those telescopes.

Infantry alone are squishy, and can be permanently injured even 100-meters away from an artillery shell. Infantry can be attacked by enemy machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, artillery and more. Infantry need tanks in dangerous locations to help deal with enemy snipers and machine guns. (Machine guns won't want to fire when a 120mm gun is pointing their way. Tanks can effectively suppress the enemy guns and give room for infantry to work). A tank can't take a direct hit from a shell, but they can be much much closer with lower chance of injury.

Artillery can't even see the target. They require the tanks and/or infantry in the front to tell the artillery where to shoot. Ditto with mortar teams (though drone warfare is clearly changing this. I don't know how drone-information is being sent back to artillery or mortar men... but some kind of communication is clearly happening)

Alone, each of these units have gross weaknesses. But if they train together and work together, they all can fight in ways far more effectively than one alone.",1651614481.0,1651613677.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i77n555,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

If they can shell the supplies (looks like the started today with the 20 something supply trucks blown up) then the tanks and troops south in Izyum will be out of fuel and ammunition.

That will leave them unable to withdraw and more importantly advance.  At that point Russia either surrenders those troops or they are removed in a bloody massacre.  It will also cut off a lot of artillery units that in a few days will allow Ukraine to move their arty in on the southern edge with safety and allow them to hammer the eastern front to shit.  

Russia now has to either pull forces back and try to counter punch Ukraine (weakening the Izyum front substantially and making it vulnerable to a counter) or they risk being stuck high and dry.

Keep in mind that the main pro-Russia party was dissolved but the vast majority of their MPs still sit under new banners in Parliament. There was at least one expulsion of one MP from Parliament who was also dismissed from the main opposition party for welcoming the Russian invasion and demanding Ukraine capitulate.

The primary pro-Russian Opposition party and its replacement have both denounced the invasion and joined in the national unity effort. The Mayor of Odesa, an Opposition Bloc politician and famed crime syndicate operator, has been stalwart in his defiance of the Russian invasion.

So while the old party was banned, the MP's, under new banners, have given truth to Zelenskyy's words under their new organization and as Independents in opposing the invasion.

* It's a very tiny geographic area (141 sqmi vs Israel's 8.6 thousand sqmi).
* The population is 22% of Israel's.
* No appreciable military assets (e.g., armor, howitzers, etc.)
* No appreciable standing army (i.e., only irregular militia.)
* Israel has total and complete air domination over the area.
* Israel has total and complete military domination over the area.

Given those facts, militants in Gaza are still launching missiles into Israel on a regular basis, sending in suicide bombers, and other attackers. Now just imagine Syria:

* 71.5 million sqmi, so roughly 8,300 times larger than Israel.
* Population of 17.5 million, so twice Israel's population.
* Outdated military gear but plenty of it.
* A standing army with a decade of fighting experience.
* An ally providing advanced air defense systems and air support, thus preventing another nation (e.g., Israel) from gaining air dominance.

Now, just imagine what Iran and Syrian forces could do that the impoverished embargoed people of Gaza can't. There's no two ways about it, Russia doesn't have to take a direct action against Israel, it just needs to declare a no fly zone over Syria and let Iran/Syria do the rest.

 >Between 2010 and 2012, four Iranian nuclear scientists (Masoud Alimohammadi, Majid Shahriari, Darioush Rezaeinejad and Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan) were assassinated, while another (Fereydoon Abbasi) was wounded in an attempted murder. In November 2020 another scientist (Mohsen Fakhrizadeh) was assassinated. Two of the killings were carried out with magnetic bombs attached to the targets' cars; Darioush Rezaeinejad was shot dead, and Masoud Alimohammadi was killed in a motorcycle-bomb explosion. The Iranian government accused Israel of complicity in the killings.

If they nuke a city I would start to agree. The more likely scenario is that nato enters Ukraine and a stand off begins similar to the Cuban missile crisis. 

There is absolutely no way the west could guarantee that its largest population centers or even high priority targets were not hit. A single nuke into a nuclear power plant could decimate the habitability of whatever country it hits. 

You're also once again missing the point where even a successful first strike on Russia would do enough damage to the planet that it might just be suicide for the USA anyways.

We would for sure be on the brink, but it's not a guarantee that they just launch a nuclear weapon back.

Its all moot point anyways. I dont think there's really a chance we see nuclear weapons on the battlefield here unless it is in total defeat, which I also dont think is a true reality for Russia right now. They likely have been warned by nato and even China that nuclear weapons are a redline by all parties. China isn't going to sit back and allow that to destroy their 100 year plan and we'd likely see much more vocal intervention on their part if they had worries that it was coming down to that.",1651595960.0,1651595224.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i76915o,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

Not saying it would be seen as morally, ethically, or logically ok thing for Russia to do but that's the nature of nukes and MAD logic.

In the second scenario, the case of a launch rather than deescalation is obscenely unlikely regardless of how much power you believe Putin has.

""Since 1789, Congress has declared war 11 times, against 10 countries, during five separate conflicts: Great Britain (1812, War of 1812); Mexico (1846, War with Mexico); Spain (1898, Spanish-American War, also known as the War of 1898); Germany (1917, World War I); Austria-Hungary (1917, World War I); Japan (1941, World War II); Germany (1941, World War II); Italy (1941, World War II); Bulgaria (1942, World War II); Hungary (1942, World War II); and Rumania (1942, World War II).14 In each of these 11 instances, the President appealed to Congress for authorization either in person before a Joint Session or in a written request.15  
Far more common, especially in the modern era, have been congressional authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) abroad. Historically, AUMFs have been much narrower in scope and much more limited than formal declarations of war, such as when Congress gave the President clearance to protect American ships against French aggression in 1789 and against Tripoli‚Äôs navy in 1802. After World War II, however, AUMFs became much broader, often granting Presidents sweeping authority to engage America‚Äôs military around the world.16 Take, for example, the Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964. As communist forces in Vietnam took increasingly militaristic actions against U.S. forces, Congress authorized the President, in sweeping but vague language, ‚Äúto promote the maintenance of international peace and security in southeast Asia.‚Äù17  
In fact, despite engaging in conflicts in places like Vietnam and Iraq over the last 70 years, Congress has not declared war since 1942. Rather, the individual congressional AUMFs have been interpreted ‚Äúas fully empowering the President to prosecute the wars,‚Äù according to law professors, Curtis A. Bradley and Jack L. Goldsmith.18 Although the concept of the AUMF has existed since the start of the Republic, the specific use of the term became commonplace in the 1990s during the Gulf War.1""",False,1651592545.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i763a6t,,5,-2,0,-2,0,0,

Yes it is a reasonable questions since russia appears to have long range cruise missiles. But what has become apparent over the course of this conflict is that Russias intelligence and targeting ability is clearly not what it should be.  They haven't been able to get air superiority so they cannot target properly or ensure the safe arrival of their payloads. Combined with their dwindling stock and inability to produce new munitions they are being very conservative. Increasingly so of late.

Even if they have the technical ability (which I am really doubting at this point) it would be a high-stakes gamble pretty much ensuring the end of the war but not likely with a good outcome for Russia.

Avoidance is any legal action taken to structure your income and/or assets in a way that reduces or spreads your tax burden. This could be as complex as a sprawling corporate structure that creates complex interacting supply chains and competing products (like General Electric) or something as simple as purchasing a house. Avoidance is specifically legal, and it is not only legal, it is behavior specifically incentivized by tax laws - encouraging retirement savings and home purchases have historically been good policy for the US. Corporate taxing structures exist to incentivize investment in new businesses, products, and innovation (research and development), and to keep the money circulating in the economy. When you hear something like ""CocaCola paid zero taxes last year"", it means that the CocaCola corporation reinvested all taxable profits under that specific structure into new infrastructure and employment - in other words, they kept the money circulating. That is a good thing for the economy, and laws are written to encourage it.

Evasion is anything that is illegal. Evasion is having all your customers pay you in cash, then writing out receipts that only cover half of your income, and pocketing the rest without reporting it. Evasion is renting your house to yourself and then claiming a loss on the rental business for a deduction. Evasion is labeling income from a business as feeding into a charity/foundation in order to avoid taxes. Evasion is any fraudulent reporting of income or expenditures.

>I mean by your logic, Ukraine to just surrender since the genocide is somehow going to magically stop when they lay down their arms right?

I want to know exactly what I said that made you say this, I'd like to know if I have terrible writing or you're just really bad at reading, or looking you're looking for a fight. No, why the fuck would I think Ukraine should surrender? Especially if I think Russia's goal is to destroy them as much as possible without major consequence on Russia's side (like being invaded for ex).

>Or maybe they should cede land for the fighting to stop, but wait no, Russia isn't going to stop until all Ukrainians are dead so it doesn't matter what Ukrainians do right?

I like how you made an assumption of my thoughts and then stacked on another layer of assumptions. I've been saying the opposite, Russia's goal (or what I think it is) is to destroy Ukraine. So Ukraine's choice is to fight it and prevent that, or let it happen. They chose the former, obviously.

You are exactly what I was talking about with my original message way up in this thread by saying you conflate people's thoughts on what Russia may be doing with what they actually agree with. I think Ukraine's goal is to drive Russia out and return to a normal life with the least amount of deaths and destruction as possible, this should be very clear.

Russia, on the other hand, at least to me appears to just simply be going in and messing shit up without a care of their soldiers, so yes I do believe going full mobilization would make a difference in that goal.

Do I think Russia's stance is logical? No, why the fuck do I need to repeatedly say that, why the fuck do you think Russia's logic is somehow my own?

In my heart, of course Russia is not winning. But they may see it as winning.

>If Russia could barely handle logistic deployments of 200k soldiers for a push to Kyiv, how do you think they will manage mass mobilization?

Extremely poorly, at the cost of many Ukranians dead, and more Russians dead. I haven't said otherwise.

Because you seem to exhibit the same fallacious mindset they do. You fail to see the bigger picture. Reality doesn't work in some magical fairy unicorn realm where Russia has infinite amounts of fuel, mechanized infantry, rations, projectile munitions, artillery, aircraft and money to throw at the Ukraine problem until it goes away. They are up against NATO's tab, not just Ukraine's. Why do you think Russias been in headlines recently doubling down on threats and statements calling for allies to stop sending shipments? Because they realize that mass mobilization will do fuck all for them except prolong the inevitable. 

I can't believe I need to explain a concept so elementary as war economics to you. Before you say ""wartime economy"", bare in mind that this extra cashflow does not fix Russia's supply problem. Sanctions have already lead to parts shortages, Russian tank manufacturers had to close shop, they are struggling to repair and maintain existing units. This problem is going to multiply over the coming months and years, to the point that all they will have to throw at Ukraine is men with guns. Then the warzone becomes a force multiplier in Ukraine's favor, suddenly, you're looking at a few thousand Russian foot soldiers against an entire Ukranian tank brigade, supported by howitzer artillery fire and drone recon. Now where is this genocide you speak of?

So let's be logical now. Mass Mobilization needed to be announced in late March when the Kyiv offensive stalled. Did they do that? No they announced a withdrawl from Kyiv to focus on Donbas. The tired and run down units in Belarus, did they go home? No, they got re-deployed. Pentagon says only a good 10 BTG'S were assembled from parts of Russia and sent into Donbas since April... Wow, almost as if the force you see infront of you is all Russia can afford to send. Mass mobilization right? 

Russia does not a have a finite amount of capable resources to completely wipe Ukraine, only 1 kind of arsenal can practically accomplish this; the big N word. But then it begs to ask the question, why bother mass mobilizing manpower, losing 20k soldiers, 10 generals, thousands of mechanized vehicles and the like when they have their nuclear arsenal? Well because they don't intend to use it. 

The current course of the conflict dictates that the longer this goes on, the wider and more disporportionate Russia's losses will be to Ukraine's. If Russia runs out of usable equipment, we could be looking at 1 dead ukranian soldier per 20 dead Russian rifflemen.

Tell me how you're simultaneously acknowledging that 200k troops have already caused destruction that adding more somehow, magically won't increase that destruction. What fantasy world are you living in? *I agree, their economy is going to tank because of it, and Ukraine will succeed in their goal of driving them out (never said otherwise).* But also, more Ukrainians will be killed. You have literally already acknowledge this in your 2nd post to me, so just stop. You know there's going to be a difference in this war if Russia goes full mobilization. My post was telling people to stop downplaying it. You are downplaying it.

>Now where is this genocide you speak of?

>How exactly is this going to be a Ukranian genocide?

What the fuck is this, like actually what is this. Go ask the many world leaders who've said it's already a genocide. Again, downplaying the reality.

>Russia does not a have a finite amount of capable resources to completely wipe Ukraine, only 1 kind of arsenal can practically accomplish this; the big N word. But then it begs to ask the question, why bother mass mobilizing manpower, losing 20k soldiers, 10 generals, thousands of mechanized vehicles and the like when they have their nuclear arsenal? Well because they don't intend to use it.

Ah yes, finally an actual point you're attempting to make. Here's a historical fact for you that can answer this.

In 1969, Russia was going to nuke China during the Sino-Soviet border conflict. It got so serious, that China was preparing for it, and the Soviets sent a representative to the US asking them to remain neutral. They told the Americans their plan to nuke China. America's response was, no fuck you, we will not remain neutral and we'll nuke your cities. This is very real, this happened.

So, Russia will never use a nuke on Ukraine so long as Russia is safe at home. So, fuck this stupid repeated nonsense you're probably thinking about NATO being a defensive alliance, fuck NATO, what matters is USA will invade your ass if you go around nuking people, and that was *China* a very communist country they were willing to protect, and in fact did in a way.

The fact that Russia has not nuked Ukraine doesn't refute my point, so nice try. Russia will seek to destroy Ukraine in other irrational ways that are less likely to get themselves invaded.

And honestly, why are you asking me this? What don't you get, Russia is not rational, they haven't made a rational decision in any of this.

So let me ask you this, if not the destruction of Ukraine and it's people, what is their goal? You realize I can just start bombing you with a bunch of rhetorical questions too right? What's their goal then huh? Why didn't they just full mobilize back in March to succeed at that goal? Oh they couldn't? Oh, then why did they start the war to begin with? DUUUURRRRRRRR.

If destroying Ukraine isn't their goal, then what are they even doing there. Why haven't they surrendered yet? Seeing as thats probably their only way out from inevitably collapsing whether economically, domestically or forcefully.

Every answer is going to be, because Russia is fucking stupid. But their stupidity is getting innocent people killed. So one could extrapolate and see that going full mobilization will result in more. AS IN MAKING A DIFFERENCE.",1651603434.0,1651602123.0,t3_uh7pck,t1_i76tp08,,4,1,0,1,0,0,

The Russian agenda is, not to put too fine a point on it, deeply anti-progressive and, well, fascist is a word you hear a lot these days. The fact that the left are opposed to these policies is obvious, not because they are Russians. The left lead with ideology and derive policy from that moral position. Whatever you think of those positions, it's kind of their thing. This sounds to me like equivocating with the argument that the Right exists solely to own libs, without meaningful policy. Right or wrong, the left have policy. The Russians are doing two things: drive a wedge between left and right in the west, and *also* normalize extremely conservative, right-wing authoritarian views. Both are true. 

To say the left are taking positions against the Russian agenda is ridiculous and the Red Scare argument becomes a facetious distraction. I would urge you to reconsider the directions of some of the connections you are making.

The left is on the defensive in this fight, and their opposition is a combination of sincere believers and others pretending to be but in fact agents with another agenda.
