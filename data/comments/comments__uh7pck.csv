Day 69 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet around my area, but air raid alerts were active for hours at a time, actually one started just now as I‚Äôm writing this. Also some good news is that today it was confirmed that Molodova village was liberated, and that means Staryi Saltiv could be next.

Gorky Park was shelled again today, that‚Äôs a nice military target they got here, those children rides had it coming and were successfully demilitarized. A football stadium near the park was also denazified during that same shelling. Thankfully nobody died, though one person was wounded.

It was funny reading that today Russia doubled down and said that Israel supports neo-Nazis and then that made Israel reconsider sending us military aid. What is Russia even doing? They are literally shooting themselves in the foot. I mean I‚Äôm not complaining, they are helping us by acting like this, but this is literally self-sabotage, do they not want to win or something?

What the hell is this? They are not even talking about Ukrainians. That‚Äôs what they want to do that to their own citizens that oppose the war. Are they in some sort of competition on who can come up with the most evil thing imaginable? It‚Äôs like we are watching some badly written villains, but the problem is that they are actually real.

‚ö°Ô∏è The main thing is from the President's address

 ‚û°Ô∏è The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end.  68th day of self-destruction of Russia.  Self-destruction in every sense of the word.  If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy.

 ‚û°Ô∏è Yesterday, for example, the Russian Foreign Minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites are allegedly among the Jews themselves.  And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood.  How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism?  These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes.  No words.

 ‚û°Ô∏è Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel about these words today.  However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow.  There is silence.  So, they agree with what their foreign minister said.  After the Russian rocket attack on Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass shootings in Drobitsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps, such an anti-Semitic attack on their minister means  Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  So the question is, will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow, knowing their new position?  Will relations with Russia remain as usual?  Because it's not accidental.  It is no coincidence that the Russian Foreign Minister is a ""great connoisseur of Hitlerism.""

‚û°Ô∏è Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike on Odessa.  Destroyed the dormitory.  A 14-year-old boy was killed.  A 17-year-old girl was wounded and had a shrapnel wound.  What is it anyway?  For what?  What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with?  And that's how they fight.  That's all.

 ‚û°Ô∏è In Lysychansk, Luhansk region, a gymnasium, which was over a hundred years old, burned down due to Russian shelling.  It was built by the Belgians for this city.  She survived two world wars.  But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia.

 ‚û°Ô∏è 220 Ukrainian children killed by the Russian army since February 24.  And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state.  1,570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling.  It's a little over two months!

 ‚û°Ô∏è Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.  They discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation.  I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark.

 ‚û°Ô∏è We are working on new sanctions against Russia.  We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future.  This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues.  We believe in this very much.  That the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel.

 ‚û°Ô∏è We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol.  The evacuation operation continues.  Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka.

 ‚û°Ô∏è I just signed a big decree on rewarding our military.  438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards.

 ‚û°Ô∏è The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to senior lieutenant Todorov Dmytro Ruslanovych for personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region.

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy and Tim Lister

Ukrainian military strikes, captured on drone footage, destroyed a number of Russian military vehicles in the village of Sulyhivka ‚Äî about 11 miles or 18 kilometers ‚Äî south of Izium in the Kharkiv oblast.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the footage, which was first uploaded to Telegram on Monday. When the footage was taken is unclear.

However, in two situation updates posted to Telegram on Saturday, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Kharkiv regional military administrator Oleg Sinegubov noted that Russian forces had tried to advance near the village.

Both said that Ukrainian forces had repelled the Russian assault, but Sinegubov claimed the Russians had sustained heavy losses.

There's been heavy fighting in the area for several weeks, as Ukrainian forces try to resist a large armored offensive from the Izium area south and west towards Sloviansk.

Good news everybody!  This is a GLORIOUS day for doomscrollers rooting for Ukraine.   Yesterday we got [firsthand reports](https://twitter.com/blacksmithVakul/status/1521035557794684928) that Staryu Saltiv was liberated by Ukraine.  This is hugely important because it indicates the russian position around Kharkiv has collapsed as [indicated by the muted silence on the russian telegram channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ugq1y4/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i723w3a/).

In addition to being great news to our boy /u/SaberFlux this means the russian supply lines to Izyum are under continuous Ukrainian threat so that great pincer in Donetsk has little chance of advancing further.

Speaking of Donetsk, it was reported today that [US Howitzers are now seeing action in battle](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1521511830644043776) and is reflected in recent, notable upticks in destroyed russian artillery (US artillery has longer range and counter artillery radar).

Between the new supply line woes to izyum, the new US artillery, and the recent attack on russian command and control in Izyum on Sunday, don't expect any great russian advances here and existing hot spots like Lyman to shift again to Ukrainian hands.

We see continued incremental gains by Ukraine in Kherson and the fear an gnashing of teeth over the Transnistria situation seems to be pestering out (like maybe russia decided its a bad idea).

Finally, though no one but the odd tweeters seem to have picked it up, [the US Military briefing today](https://twitter.com/deptofdefense/status/1521490170398359555) had the US Military telling congress the war should be wrapped up in a few weeks.

Israel has reacted with fury after Russia's foreign minister claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ""had Jewish blood"".

Sergei Lavrov made the comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish.

Israel's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and¬†demanded an apology.

The comments have been condemned across the political spectrum in Israel and by newspapers in the country.

In an analysis piece, the¬†Jerusalem Post¬†said it meant Israel could no longer be neutral on the war in Ukraine.

Jerusalem‚Äôs best-laid plans to ""somehow stay above the war"" have now been undone, it says.

Another Israeli newspaper,¬†Haaretz, carries comments¬†from the American Jewish Committee saying: ""We‚Äôve repeatedly said denazification is needed - in Moscow, not Kyiv.

""Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, one of Putin‚Äôs enablers-in-chief, makes clear why. His statement is grotesque.""

Sensory satellite data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System has detected a number of fires in the village, and around the area, since April 27.

In the drone video, there are a number of smoldering Russian military vehicles.

In a Sunday briefing posted on Telegram, the Ukraine Armed Forces said Russian forces were moving south from the Kharkiv oblast and into Oleksandrivka.

According to briefing, the Russians were attempting to advance on Lyman, a strategic and heavily contested city just south of the village.

In recent weeks, the Russian military has conducted repeated military strikes on Lyman, including on its railroad infrastructure.

The Russian Ministry of Defense also admitted to military activity near Oleksandrivka, saying in a Monday briefing posted to Telegram that they targeted the area around the village with missiles.

From CNN's Natasha Bertrand

US President¬†Joe Biden¬†has asked the US Congress¬†to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to make it easier for highly educated Russians to obtain visas to work in the United States, according to a section of the White House‚Äôs Ukraine supplemental budget request submitted to lawmakers last week and reviewed by CNN.

The request, if enacted, would allow Russians with a masters or doctoral degree in the fields of science, technology, engineering or math to apply for a visa without first obtaining an employer sponsor in the US.¬†

The amendment would also require the Department of Homeland Security ‚Äúto expedite consideration of such applications,‚Äù the document says, ‚Äúas appropriate‚Äù and with the necessary vetting.¬†

The administration explained in the document that the authority ‚Äúwould help the U.S. attract and retain Russian STEM talent and undercut Russia‚Äôs innovative potential, benefitting U.S. national security.‚Äù The authority would expire four years after the date that it is enacted, according to the document.¬†",False,1651627914.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

Ukraine's outspoken ambassador in Berlin has sharply criticised Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz for not yet visiting Kyiv in a show of support, unlike a number of other European leaders.  
  
Scholz indicated on Monday night that he wouldn't visit the Ukrainian capital until German President Frank-Walter Steinmeiner had gone there.  
  
Ukraine rejected the offer of a visit from Steinmeier last month, in what was widely seen at the time as a snub.  
  
""Acting like a sulky liver sausage doesn't sound very statesmanlike,"" Ukrainian ambassador Andriy Melnyk told the German press agency. ""This is about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine - it's no kindergarten.""  
  
Melnyk has ruffled feathers in Germany, repeatedly criticising the chancellor's centre-left Social Democrats for years of close ties to Russia.  
  
Scholz denied responding hesitantly to Russia's invasion: ""I've always made quick decisions, in tandem with everyone else... but my line is that we act in a level-headed and prudent manner.""",False,1651569876.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

**'This is your finest hour': UK PM to address Ukraine's parliament**

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to describe Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion as the country's ""finest hour"" when he address its parliament virtually on Tuesday.  
  
Johnson is set to say that the UK Parliament met throughout World War Two, just as Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada has done through the war with Russia, and that the British people showed ""such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour"".  
  
""This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come,"" he will say.  
  
Johnson will also announce a ¬£300m package in extra military support, which will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter-battery radar system, GPS jammers and night-vision devices.

She's dead as well, but her children's books inspire millions across the world. She told old children tales, often using strong female children leads, said to have laid the foundations of many a great women. In a period where women didn't even have voting rights in all of Europe. 

My mother is the kind of old woman who melts at the sight of children and babies, but even she had reverence over how kind Astrid was when she met her several times with my oldest brother. Despite her books being the most translated children's books in the world, she gladly listened and talked to my then toddler brother. She had that warm glow and security that made even restless children pause, relax, and listen in awe.

We sat at Astrid's remembrance statue now in spring, snow still in ditches as flowers budded for sunlight. I removed debris from one of the benches as my now old granny mother sat down. I said she [Astrid] would've wanted it because she'd enjoyed the company. My old mothers eyes lit up like a humans only can when remembering something with pure love. 

""Oh yes, she'd loved that. She'd strike a conversation."" She said, beaming in her smile in the spring sun. 

""She always did with your brother, always. That was just the way she was."" Ordinarily I'd say it'd felt sad. But I know Astrid would've just chuckled warmly and said to not fuss over her, to instead enjoy the warm sun with her.

A minority party with unpopular policy stances needs a way to ""scam"" people into voting for them. 

So they scapegoat women, gays, minorities, and members of the other political parties. They grab the attention of idiots and lunatic fringe haters, and glom them all together in hopes that they'll get their collection of minorities (by political persuasion) to out-number the collection of minorities getting targeted.  (in the case of misogynists, you've got to convince enough women who are afraid of ""other races"" to vote alongside the men who are voting for anti-women policies. And this works fine, and is relatively easy: as long as you control the loudest media voices). 

This culture-war game works; but it takes a little time, and once you're in power you've fear-mongered enough to your little base of deplorables, that  they're terrified they'll 'lose-power' (and that they'll be treated the way they treat other minorities) so they embrace authoritarianism and fascism.

From there, it just escalates, because this former minority party now needs to use modern media tools as weapons to keep power. This propaganda spreads their message of hate, until a certain critical mass of haters is reached. Then they're basically forced to do what the angry mob wants.

> Is that ammo cooking off or a MLRS barrage being brought down on a camp of trucks?

If those trucks were full of 152mm artillery shells or worse... GRADs rockets, hitting those trucks directly could make a ""mini MLRS"" like-explosion as all of the rockets and ammo cooks off.

Those explosions could of course, hit other trucks, causing them to also go off.

--------

Artillery strikes / MLRS barrages don't have that amount of black, thick smoke. That's something cooking off, I'm assuming gasoline?

It very well could have been ""one lucky bomb"" that set off a chain-reaction here. Or maybe it was a MLRS strike from the Ukrainians (why have ""one lucky bomb"" when you can shoot 30 rockets?).
