Day 69 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was pretty quiet around my area, but air raid alerts were active for hours at a time, actually one started just now as I’m writing this. Also some good news is that today it was confirmed that Molodova village was liberated, and that means Staryi Saltiv could be next.

Gorky Park was shelled again today, that’s a nice military target they got here, those children rides had it coming and were successfully demilitarized. A football stadium near the park was also denazified during that same shelling. Thankfully nobody died, though one person was wounded.

It was funny reading that today Russia doubled down and said that Israel supports neo-Nazis and then that made Israel reconsider sending us military aid. What is Russia even doing? They are literally shooting themselves in the foot. I mean I’m not complaining, they are helping us by acting like this, but this is literally self-sabotage, do they not want to win or something?

Their propagandists are also just becoming more and more cartoonishly evil by the day, [literally discussing on their TV how they plan to steal our corn and sell it to China.](https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1521155508626984960)  Also saying how [anyone who opposes their letter Z should be put into concentration camps, be reeducated and then sterilized.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/uhfdoy/russian_television_offers_responsibility_for/) 

What the hell is this? They are not even talking about Ukrainians. That’s what they want to do that to their own citizens that oppose the war. Are they in some sort of competition on who can come up with the most evil thing imaginable? It’s like we are watching some badly written villains, but the problem is that they are actually real.

The political decision of the Chancellery and the Ministry of Defense was made against the advice of leading military personnel in the Bundeswehr. They had pointed out that only around 40 of the 119 Panzerhaubitzen 2000 in the Bundeswehr's inventory were operational and indispensable for their own needs. The use of the weapons, which have a complex, digital fire control system, for Ukraine is also questioned. The government ignored these concerns - although one of its political maxims is not to weaken the Bundeswehr and its ability to form alliances with arms deliveries to Ukraine.

> **Isn't there any way to explain this to the girls at the reception? Explain to them that there are people and nations in the world who want to live in their own country, speak their own language and do not need Moscow's supervision, not even its sisterly love?**

> So you would like to explain to the Russians that there are other countries, other peoples, that Russia is not the alpha and omega and that maybe someone doesn't need it? They know that, but they don't think so.

> Russians have been travelling the world for years, sunbathing on Turkish, Greek or Egyptian beaches. They know there is a foreign country, they even like it because they can boast about their stay in Paris and bring back souvenirs.

> But at the same time, in their eyes, the other, more important ""order"" applies. With Russia in the lead.

⚡️ The main thing is from the President's address

 ➡️ The 68th day of our strong defense is coming to an end.  68th day of self-destruction of Russia.  Self-destruction in every sense of the word.  If this country once had what is called a reputation, now Russia does things on a daily basis that simply preclude any adequacy.

 ➡️ Yesterday, for example, the Russian Foreign Minister openly and without hesitation said that the biggest anti-Semites are allegedly among the Jews themselves.  And that Hitler allegedly had Jewish blood.  How could this be said on the eve of the anniversary of the victory over Nazism?  These words mean that Russia's top diplomat is blaming the Jewish people for Nazi crimes.  No words.

 ➡️ Of course, there is a big scandal in Israel about these words today.  However, no one hears objections or excuses from Moscow.  There is silence.  So, they agree with what their foreign minister said.  After the Russian rocket attack on Babyn Yar in Kyiv, after the Menorah damaged by shelling at the site of the mass shootings in Drobitsky Yar near Kharkiv, after the deaths of ordinary people who survived the Nazi occupation and Nazi concentration camps, such an anti-Semitic attack on their minister means  Russia has forgotten all the lessons of World War II.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  Or maybe they never taught those lessons.  So the question is, will the Israeli ambassador stay in Moscow, knowing their new position?  Will relations with Russia remain as usual?  Because it's not accidental.  It is no coincidence that the Russian Foreign Minister is a ""great connoisseur of Hitlerism.""

➡️ Today, Russian troops launched another missile strike on Odessa.  Destroyed the dormitory.  A 14-year-old boy was killed.  A 17-year-old girl was wounded and had a shrapnel wound.  What is it anyway?  For what?  What did these children and the dormitory threaten the Russian state with?  And that's how they fight.  That's all.

 ➡️ In Lysychansk, Luhansk region, a gymnasium, which was over a hundred years old, burned down due to Russian shelling.  It was built by the Belgians for this city.  She survived two world wars.  But, as we see, this gymnasium turned out to be a terrible threat to modern Russia.

 ➡️ 220 Ukrainian children killed by the Russian army since February 24.  And we still don't know about everyone, because we don't have access to the temporarily occupied areas of our state.  1,570 educational institutions were destroyed or damaged by shelling.  It's a little over two months!

 ➡️ Today in Kyiv I met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Denmark.  They discussed the whole range of issues of our bilateral relations, especially defense, financial and political cooperation.  I see progress in implementing the agreements reached during the talks with the Prime Minister of Denmark.

 ➡️ We are working on new sanctions against Russia.  We expect a new package from the European Union in the near future.  This package should include clear steps to block Russia's energy revenues.  We believe in this very much.  That the terrorist state is not given a billion euros a day for fuel.

 ➡️ We continue to do everything to save our people from Mariupol.  The evacuation operation continues.  Tomorrow we also expect movement through humanitarian corridors from Berdyansk, Tokmak, Vasylivka.

 ➡️ I just signed a big decree on rewarding our military.  438 servicemen of the Armed Forces of Ukraine were awarded state awards.

 ➡️ The title of Hero of Ukraine was awarded to senior lieutenant Todorov Dmytro Ruslanovych for personal courage and extraordinary efficiency in the battles against the occupiers in the Donetsk region.

From CNN's Paul P. Murphy and Tim Lister

Ukrainian military strikes, captured on drone footage, destroyed a number of Russian military vehicles in the village of Sulyhivka — about 11 miles or 18 kilometers — south of Izium in the Kharkiv oblast.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the footage, which was first uploaded to Telegram on Monday. When the footage was taken is unclear.

However, in two situation updates posted to Telegram on Saturday, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Kharkiv regional military administrator Oleg Sinegubov noted that Russian forces had tried to advance near the village.

Both said that Ukrainian forces had repelled the Russian assault, but Sinegubov claimed the Russians had sustained heavy losses.

There's been heavy fighting in the area for several weeks, as Ukrainian forces try to resist a large armored offensive from the Izium area south and west towards Sloviansk.

The Ukrainian army conducted a “significant counteroffensive” that likely pushed Russian forces roughly 40 km east of Kharkiv, the Institute for the Study of War says.

This would “unhinge the Russian positions northeast of Kharkiv” and “set conditions for a broader operation to drive the Russians from most of their positions around the city,” the Institute said in its latest assessment of the Russian offensive campaign.

It added that the Russian army may then face a dilemma of “whether to reinforce their positions near Kharkiv to prevent such a broader Ukrainian operation or to risk losing most or all of their positions in artillery range of the city.”

Good news everybody!  This is a GLORIOUS day for doomscrollers rooting for Ukraine.   Yesterday we got [firsthand reports](https://twitter.com/blacksmithVakul/status/1521035557794684928) that Staryu Saltiv was liberated by Ukraine.  This is hugely important because it indicates the russian position around Kharkiv has collapsed as [indicated by the muted silence on the russian telegram channels](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ugq1y4/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/i723w3a/).

In addition to being great news to our boy /u/SaberFlux this means the russian supply lines to Izyum are under continuous Ukrainian threat so that great pincer in Donetsk has little chance of advancing further.

Speaking of Donetsk, it was reported today that [US Howitzers are now seeing action in battle](https://twitter.com/JackDetsch/status/1521511830644043776) and is reflected in recent, notable upticks in destroyed russian artillery (US artillery has longer range and counter artillery radar).

Between the new supply line woes to izyum, the new US artillery, and the recent attack on russian command and control in Izyum on Sunday, don't expect any great russian advances here and existing hot spots like Lyman to shift again to Ukrainian hands.

We see continued incremental gains by Ukraine in Kherson and the fear an gnashing of teeth over the Transnistria situation seems to be pestering out (like maybe russia decided its a bad idea).

Finally, though no one but the odd tweeters seem to have picked it up, [the US Military briefing today](https://twitter.com/deptofdefense/status/1521490170398359555) had the US Military telling congress the war should be wrapped up in a few weeks.

Israel has reacted with fury after Russia's foreign minister claimed that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ""had Jewish blood"".

Sergei Lavrov made the comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish.

Israel's foreign ministry summoned Russia's ambassador for ""clarification"" and demanded an apology.

The comments have been condemned across the political spectrum in Israel and by newspapers in the country.

In an analysis piece, the Jerusalem Post said it meant Israel could no longer be neutral on the war in Ukraine.

Jerusalem’s best-laid plans to ""somehow stay above the war"" have now been undone, it says.

Another Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, carries comments from the American Jewish Committee saying: ""We’ve repeatedly said denazification is needed - in Moscow, not Kyiv.

""Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, one of Putin’s enablers-in-chief, makes clear why. His statement is grotesque.""

In the drone video, there are a number of smoldering Russian military vehicles.

In a Sunday briefing posted on Telegram, the Ukraine Armed Forces said Russian forces were moving south from the Kharkiv oblast and into Oleksandrivka.

According to briefing, the Russians were attempting to advance on Lyman, a strategic and heavily contested city just south of the village.

In recent weeks, the Russian military has conducted repeated military strikes on Lyman, including on its railroad infrastructure.

The Russian Ministry of Defense also admitted to military activity near Oleksandrivka, saying in a Monday briefing posted to Telegram that they targeted the area around the village with missiles.

Long but worthwhile read into the minds of Russians who support the war:


>People in Russia are accustomed to seeing war as a sacred experience, one that can wash everything away and return them to some true meaning, restoring them to themselves. They think war will release them from what they ended up living in. 


>The entire country’s repeating words about “denazification,” “demilitarization,” and “liberation.” You can’t help but notice that these words didn’t come out of nowhere. This really is what people want, subconsciously, but they can’t have it. So they vent their frustration by being aggressive to the people they think are most like them. Russia is doing to Ukraine what it wants to do to itself.

The Russian military “has reacted extremely nervously” to Ukraine’s success of getting more than 156 civilian evacuees from Mariupol to safety by attacking cities across the country, Zelenskyy has said.

“Various Ukrainian cities have once again become targets for Russian missiles and Russian strikes. Lviv, Vinnytsia, Kyiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Odesa, Kharkiv region – such a scale of today’s shelling clearly does not indicate that Russia has any special military purpose,” Zelenskyy said in his nighttime address.

“Strike at Zakarpattia? What exactly can it give Russia? They are trying to vent their powerlessness. Because they can’t beat Ukraine,” he added.

From CNN's Natasha Bertrand

US President Joe Biden has asked the US Congress to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to make it easier for highly educated Russians to obtain visas to work in the United States, according to a section of the White House’s Ukraine supplemental budget request submitted to lawmakers last week and reviewed by CNN.

The request, if enacted, would allow Russians with a masters or doctoral degree in the fields of science, technology, engineering or math to apply for a visa without first obtaining an employer sponsor in the US. 

The amendment would also require the Department of Homeland Security “to expedite consideration of such applications,” the document says, “as appropriate” and with the necessary vetting. 

The administration explained in the document that the authority “would help the U.S. attract and retain Russian STEM talent and undercut Russia’s innovative potential, benefitting U.S. national security.” The authority would expire four years after the date that it is enacted, according to the document. ",False,1651627914.0,t3_uh7pck,t3_uh7pck,,0,39,0,39,0,0,

Ukraine's outspoken ambassador in Berlin has sharply criticised Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz for not yet visiting Kyiv in a show of support, unlike a number of other European leaders.  
  
Scholz indicated on Monday night that he wouldn't visit the Ukrainian capital until German President Frank-Walter Steinmeiner had gone there.  
  
Ukraine rejected the offer of a visit from Steinmeier last month, in what was widely seen at the time as a snub.  
  
""Acting like a sulky liver sausage doesn't sound very statesmanlike,"" Ukrainian ambassador Andriy Melnyk told the German press agency. ""This is about the most brutal war of extermination since the Nazi attack on Ukraine - it's no kindergarten.""

**'This is your finest hour': UK PM to address Ukraine's parliament**

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to describe Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion as the country's ""finest hour"" when he address its parliament virtually on Tuesday.  
  
Johnson is set to say that the UK Parliament met throughout World War Two, just as Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada has done through the war with Russia, and that the British people showed ""such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour"".  
  
""This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come,"" he will say.  
  
Johnson will also announce a £300m package in extra military support, which will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter-battery radar system, GPS jammers and night-vision devices.

She's dead as well, but her children's books inspire millions across the world. She told old children tales, often using strong female children leads, said to have laid the foundations of many a great women. In a period where women didn't even have voting rights in all of Europe. 

My mother is the kind of old woman who melts at the sight of children and babies, but even she had reverence over how kind Astrid was when she met her several times with my oldest brother. Despite her books being the most translated children's books in the world, she gladly listened and talked to my then toddler brother. She had that warm glow and security that made even restless children pause, relax, and listen in awe.

We sat at Astrid's remembrance statue now in spring, snow still in ditches as flowers budded for sunlight. I removed debris from one of the benches as my now old granny mother sat down. I said she [Astrid] would've wanted it because she'd enjoyed the company. My old mothers eyes lit up like a humans only can when remembering something with pure love. 

""Oh yes, she'd loved that. She'd strike a conversation."" She said, beaming in her smile in the spring sun. 

""She always did with your brother, always. That was just the way she was."" Ordinarily I'd say it'd felt sad. But I know Astrid would've just chuckled warmly and said to not fuss over her, to instead enjoy the warm sun with her.

A minority party with unpopular policy stances needs a way to ""scam"" people into voting for them. 

So they scapegoat women, gays, minorities, and members of the other political parties. They grab the attention of idiots and lunatic fringe haters, and glom them all together in hopes that they'll get their collection of minorities (by political persuasion) to out-number the collection of minorities getting targeted.  (in the case of misogynists, you've got to convince enough women who are afraid of ""other races"" to vote alongside the men who are voting for anti-women policies. And this works fine, and is relatively easy: as long as you control the loudest media voices). 

This culture-war game works; but it takes a little time, and once you're in power you've fear-mongered enough to your little base of deplorables, that  they're terrified they'll 'lose-power' (and that they'll be treated the way they treat other minorities) so they embrace authoritarianism and fascism.

From there, it just escalates, because this former minority party now needs to use modern media tools as weapons to keep power. This propaganda spreads their message of hate, until a certain critical mass of haters is reached. Then they're basically forced to do what the angry mob wants.

The worst problem is that we've seen this happen over and over again in history (and the same process works even in non-democracies, or fake democracies; you still need to manufacture consent to some degree).
