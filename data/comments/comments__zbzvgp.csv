According to Peter Longerich, Dirlewanger's leadership ""was characterized by continued alcohol abuse, looting, sadistic atrocities, rape, and murder—and his mentor Berger tolerated this behaviour, as did Himmler, who so urgently needed men such as the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger in his fight against 'subhumanity'.

TL;DR Russia can't make more Kh-555s, ran out of stock of them, has between 500 and 1060 Kh-101s left. UA AA defense should have easier time due to difference between Kh-55 and Kh-101.


From my own analysis:

Images of impact sites suggest that only Kh-101s are used in the attacks. No more Kh-555s. Only inert versions of Kh-55s as decoys. 

I called my friend, who is much deeper into the subject and he said that Russia is no longer able to make Kh-55 family missiles. Apparently some kit stockpiles were... misplaced. So no more Kh-55s, Kh-65(S), no more Kh-555s. Only Kh-101s (which the current rate of production is 20 per month) and Kalibrs (they were making 30 per month, it was supposed to be ramped up to 50). 

They have less than 700 unarmed Kh-55s in stock, they shouldn't have any Kh-555s left and the number of Kh-101s is unknown (they were manufacturing them for 9 years, considering they were making around 250 engines for them per year and they should make around 700-900 of the nuke capable variant to utilize the cruise missile nuclear warheads,  it would suggest they made around 2200 of both variants, 1300-1500 of which were Kh-101s).


If we will speculate further to answer ""how many cruise missiles Russia has"" we don't know how many missiles were used in the initial phase of the war (when they were actually attacking military targets), so let's focus on the time line since October. We have the higher end of initial stocks (700 Kh-55s and 1500 Kh-101s). Ukraine MoD visually confirmed 132 Kh-101, however we know about at least 600 air launches. We know about at least one full over 100 missile Kh-101 salvo (October, over half shot down) after which they started to use Kh-55s as decoys. So we have 700 Kh-55s and 1400 Kh-101. Let's make it 1:2 ratio. That gives us 170 Kh-55s and 340 Kh-101s.
So 530 Kh-55s and 1060 Kh-101s left. This is the higher end of the bracket, assuming they are making 20 missiles per month, constantly, for 9 years. Ukrainian MoD is giving us the number of 15 per month, but doesn't specify if it's for Kh-101/Kh-102 or Kh-101 only. If it's for the whole platform - then the total would be 1600 instead of 2200 and it would mean that Russia has less than 500 of Kh-101 left.

(https://visitukraine.today/blog/1212/how-many-missiles-russia-has-left-commentary-of-the-minister-of-defense-of-ukraine)


Why is it important? Kh-55s and Kh-555s have almost the same radar signature and flight pattern. Kh-101s has much different radar signature (and different jet engine). So if there is incoming missile wave, the anti air defense can distinguish and focus on the Kh-101s, shooting Kh-55s after dealt with the main threat.

If we look at the prospects for the future Ukrainian offensives, Crimea has a lot of the same hallmarks that Kherson had, it will be nearly impossible for Russia to resupply with the Kerch bridge fully taken out, and Ukraine would have full fire control over the peninsula to hit Russian logistics and defenses. The Donbass on the other hand can never be cut off from resupply in the same way.

A lot of people have said that Ukraine will likely never get Crimea back but in reality, even if Russia retreats from all of the rest of Ukraine and only tries to retain Crimea, Russia will have a very difficult time actually supplying any of the troops on the peninsula, they are basically as good as surrounded at that point. It's basically the same situation as Kherson, way too many people across a body of water to supply efficiently, to the point that they are combat ineffective and Ukraine can just destroy them piece by piece. 

A lot of people point to the narrow corridor to enter Crimea as proof that it's easy to defend but a choke-point will also just mean Russian defenses will be more or less centralized in one easy to hit area.

The simple fact is there hasn't been much potential military offensive strategy to theorise about and most of my existing stuff still stands (looking at you Northern Luhansk and Melitopol).

Something has been bugging me about Russia's strategic actions in the last few months and I wasn't sure what. I kept just putting it out of my mind with 'Russia doing Russia things'. I also don't really find much interest in trying to predict what Russia will do, as it's usually really stupid (Russia doing Russia things).

It wasn't until I watched Anders Puck Neilson's latest video [(YouTube) Russia still hopes for a quick victory](https://youtu.be/xpNxwzb1rt4) that I realised what it was... (Also definitely worth a watch for those that haven't, he's superb).

As Anders points out, Russia is still trying for a 'quick' victory but yet their capabilities and the facts on the ground don't really aline with that.

They've partially mobilised and likely hope to conduct offensives in the spring, but that isn't likely to change the situation on the ground much.

The only thing I can think is that Russia has run out of options. Because about the best they can hope for out of this mobilisation is to try and freeze the battle lines, Ukraine is far ahead in mobilisation and training and is beginning to bridge the equipment deficit with allied assistance.

Anyways I'm rambling at this point, watch the video and you'll see what I mean, Anders is far more proficient at explaining it than a strategy/geopolitics nerd like myself.

**What next for Ukraine?**

Keep an eye out for where they conduct the most intensive shaping ops (targeting C3, logistics) - that may give a good indicator of where they will conduct any potential winter offensives.

The 3 possible locations/avenues:

1. East to Northern Luhansk. Possible but carries risk with a large area of border to then defend. Further strains the BSRs (Bull S%@! Republics - feel free to use this) logistically.

2. South to Melitopol. A theatre-level game changer, cutting off Crimea and occupied Southern Ukraine. Risky, large resource investment requirement and my personal dark horse.

3. East/South East from Kherson towards Crimea. Risky to move significant forces across the Dnieper, but given the poor defensive ground on the Left Bank, it does have potential. Watch for bridging efforts.

I still think Melitopol is what we're likely to see but I was thinking that around the time of the Izium liberation (although East of Kharkiv was my other potential offensive prediction at the time - so yay, I got that one).

Thoughts?

Also watch the damn vid, thank me later.

The argument is basically that the city is absolutely crucial for Russia to project power in the Black Sea and that their ability to do so was threatened after the Maidan Revolution. They invaded and annexed Crimea shortly after because it was the only way to guarantee the port would still be theirs to use.

The broader invasion of Ukraine is because Russia NEEDS a land bridge in order to supply the area, as the Kerch Bridge is/was not enough to keep the population happy for much longer, given that tourism is reduced to only Russians, and agriculture was threatened by the water supply being cut at Nova Khakova.

I predict that if Ukraine manages to break the southern front down the middle all the way to the Azov Seaz Russia will, in months if not weeks, perform another ""goodwill gesture"" in the east and leave the Donetz and Luhansk Republics to fend for themselves.

But the facts are that Russia had a long-standing rent agreement on the port with great liberties, that were never threatened by the Maidan protesters. Ukraine at the time also did not have the military force to evict Russia. If you want an explanation, what you need to do is look at what Putin said during the revolution, and what he said during the other color revolutions. Putin started reacting after the color revolutions rolled through the Middle East in 2011, and got outright reactionary when during the runup and the aftermath of the 2012 Russian Presidential election for the very first time saw widespread protesting against him. It was at this point he instituded draconian new laws and organisations to handle protesters. OMON, RosGvard and special police units number in the hundreds of thousands and quell anyattempt at protests.

He reacted strongly to Maidan, because he feared it would spread to Russia, and his moves afterwards were always to paint the legally elected governments that followed Maidan as vile, unlawful and illegitimate.

In reality as others have pointed out Sevastopol has no economic value as a export port as it has poor logistics connections to the rest of Russia even over the land route. 

The most important port for Russia in the Black Sea is Novorossiysk which has much more developed logistics connections to the rest of Russia both via road, rail and oil/gas pipeline infrastructure. It is also closer than Sevastopol is thus it is cheaper to transport goods to Novorossiysk than to Sevastopol from the rest of Russia. 

Even if Russia controlled Crimea and the land route to it most companies would choose to export via Novorossiysk given the shorter transport distance to said port and the better logistics capabilities to and from it. 

So from now on whenever you see someone make this economic argument for Sevastopol or even funnier argue its the only warm water port Russia has in the black sea know you are dealing with either an ignorant person just repeating Russian talking points or someone intentionally trying to mislead you. 

With regards to the military importance of Sevastopol it would have been cheaper for Russia to expand the military port in Novorossiysk  and move the rest of the Black Sea fleet there. 

The Russian navy lacks ability to operate in a contested Black Sea anyway even with Sevastopol as evidenced by their inability to even operate out of Sevastopol while fighting against Ukraine which lacks a navy at this point.

af23e7145f14ed31ab3d8e13539235e5,zbzvgp,iyx31ea,"Seems roughly analogous to the Franco regime of Spain during WW2. 

Franco successfully tap-danced around outright joining the war on the side of the Germans and Italians - even though Franco owed a lot to his fellow-fascists for the support they gave him in winning the Spanish civil war. Look up “gratitude” in the dictionary, and you won’t find his picture there! 

Hitler tried his best to pressure Franco into joining, only to be faced with a morass of bargaining, lying, and evasion. Franco never did join (though he gave the Nazis all sorts of help). 

This was when the Nazis were at the height of their apparent success. Hitler wanted Spanish help to seal off the Mediterranean against British armed forces, and offered to help Franco to seize Gibraltar. 

Franco recognized his nation was simply too weak and divided to even consider getting involved in a great-power war. If he did, he’d be utterly reliant on Hitler, his own forces would not last long unaided against any of the major adversaries. 

This proved to be the right move for Franco. While Hitler shot himself, and Mussolini’s corpse dangled upside down, Franco lived to an old age … I have no doubt whatsoever that Lukashenko is thinking about that precedent! 

Though whether he could survive the fall of Putin is more dubious, to say the least. His regime is even weaker and more divided than Franco’s ever was. 

One thing for sure - his chances of surviving go down *considerably* if he gets directly involved in a losing war. So, like Franco, you can expect him to give all sorts of help to Putin (he is after all quite reliant on Putin), but to tap-dance, to the best of his ability, around any direct involvement in the war.

There *can* be guarantees given to Russia, and the first guarantee is ""NATO will not attack Russia first, unprovoked, and as long as Russia does not make military or agressive moves towards any of NATO's allies."" The *conditions* for that guarantee is:

* Russia leaves all of Ukraine.

* Russia apologizes for its unprovoked attack and agrees to pay full reparations to Ukraine

* Russia hands over all war criminals to the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague

* Putin steps down and is prosecuted

I wonder, when west pushed Ukraine to disarm ourselves in order to guarantee ""peace in the world, nuclear non-proliferation, and security to NATO allies"" it was not too dangerous to leave us without weapons.

We happily obliged, thinking that we have no one to fight with, and that we have security guarantees from the west. We were very wrong. 
Ukraine right makes Europe more secure by dealing with Russian military. Every tank, plane, missile, IFV, destroyed in Ukraine is one less to worry about for NATO allies. We can do that even better, if we are provided with the right tools.

It only makes it safer for the Russians, giving them more chances to win. And costing countless Ukrainian lives in the process.

Spaniel's ""It's about sevastopol"" could make sense, but you have to involve some [rules-for-rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) to make that work; the cost to the russian economy of this invasion is absolutely insane and would have easily paid for moving the entire sevastopol operation over to Novorossiysk, and, why not, throw in an entire second base at Sochi if you want, with a heck of a lot of long range equipment. Sevastopol is undoubtedly the best location for a base to project power on the black sea, but by no means the only place - it's incredibly threatening to Ukraine but other than that, it's far away from everywhere else.  Being able to 'threaten' romania and bulgaria does not seem useful (Looking at the EU as a whole, their total economic dependence on their black sea coast is middling and their economic and nato power is phenomenal, so what's the point? MAD is the only way that's ever gonna go, there is no need for a navy in a backwater) - threatening turkey and georgia is a lot simpler from russia's own coast (not to mention turkey being a NATO member). Threatening the bosporus is hard to do from either Novorossiysk or Sevastopol.

So, the only explanation that remains that makes sense is either long-term projects to project power into Ukraine, but, see below, that doesn't _now_ make any more sense, as Spaniel covered, but in that case why don't they abandon this attempt / call it 'mission accomplished', if the mission is simply to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO, as spaniel covered - OR, the military bigwigs think Sevastopol is hot shit. Even though it is not, Putin has presumably not been able to change their mind on this, and applying some rules-for-rulers logic, cannot continue to operate as essentially a dictator, without their support, which cannot be bought without assurances about sevastopol.

Economically stupid from day 1, doubly stupid today, but Putin remains convinced that without it, his military command will be sufficiently unruly that he can no longer rely on them, and with it, he feels his position as ruler is not secure.

That's.. _a lot_ of theorizing to get there, and Spaniel didn't cover any of this bit, he just sort of posits 'must be about sevastopol' without truly delving into why it is an irreplaceable port. Given that it really isn't.

Having said all that, the remaining conclusions aren't any better:

* Putin is a fucking idiot who doesn't realize this is a loser.
* Putin is powerless to correct the course of the rockslide he kicked off - if he could travel back in time and unstart this war he would, but he can't, and sees no way out whilst remaining in power. But, in addition, he's not even looking to adjust the goals of this war for once to actual achievable goals, which would involve getting out of Zaphorihzhia province. It also requires he was still an utter fucking idiot (or extremely out of control of the local russian outlay and saw no way out of it) when the sham annexation referendums were held, which is now severely crimping his options to get out of this.
* Putin is not an idiot and has plausible reasons that he really could win this thing if he holds out long enough. Let's hope not; that would imply he knows something we don't.
* Putin just doesn't care and is obsessed with Sevastopol and possibly all of Ukraine himself / is obsessed with expanding the empire back to the old USSR borders, nevermind that this country was already incapable of using the massive land holdings it held before.

In February the expectation was that Ukrainians would become armed insurgents.  This is how USA lost multiple wars so it was assumed that Russia would lose a war in the same way.  That is why Ukraine got half a million detonators for IEDs, infantry portable rocket launchers, and small arms.  The situation evolved.  The weapons that arrive always seam late, but they are responses to the changing situation.  NATO could have started giving Ukraine 155mm guns in January.  There was no reason to believe Ukraine had time to shoot all of the 152mm ammunition *in Ukraine*.  Ukraine also got all the in 152mm inventories in former Warsaw pact countries.

Its not ""near zero"". Russia has plenty of chances at winning this war, with bring someone like Trump to power, or gaining more from Iran and NK, or even fixing their shit (sounds improbable), and starting to use their weapons, that they have plenty of – smart. 

Russian nuclear threat in response to new weapons is not credible. They will not attack anyone with Nukes if Russian land is not invaded. Us taking Kherson proved that. A city that was proclaimed a russian, a city they threatened to unleased nukes for is now liberated. And nothing happened. Russia threatened for delivery of Stingers, delivery of AA guns, new artillery, Himars. They will continue to do so, and threaten for every new deliver. And yet when west finally gives us these weapons - nothing happens! 

It shows that you cannot use ""chance of nuclear war"" as an argument. Its nuclear blackmail. If Russia is allowed to get away and use nuclear blackmail with success, then what the stops them from saying “stop HIMARS deliveries or we will Nuke!”. Or even ""give us entire Ukraine or we Nuke!"". """"Give us Latvia or we Nuke!"". ""Give us Alaska or we Nuke"". 

You ether submit to nuclear blackmail or you don’t. 

Ukraine gave up its nukes in order to ""reduce chance of nuclear war"". Right now, we lose people because we made this choice. We are now making west more secure by dealing with Russia. Giving us more weapons to deal with them better, will prove that international order still works, that nuclear disarmament is not dead, and that west will help stop genocides. 
Stalling with weapons deliveries allows Russia to adapt, gain more resources, or even outright hinder support for Ukraine by helping someone like Trump get elected in US, or other western states. 

There is an opportunity to defeat Russia now. It may go away in the future.
