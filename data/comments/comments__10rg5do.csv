Day 343-344 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were mostly quiet, there were no missile strikes aimed at Kharkiv, but as usual Kupiansk continued to get shelled repeatedly anyway. At this point most of the air raid alerts in our region coincide with some missile hitting Kupiansk, or it simply getting shelled. They have been just obsessed with shelling Kupiansk ever since they lost it, same thing with Kherson, which has been relentlessly shelled after Russians fled from it.

They are also very obsessed with shelling civilians in general, as yesterday they hit yet another apartment building in Kramatorsk, just a couple of days after hitting one here in Kharkiv. They hit this one with a bigger missile, apparently it was an Iskander this time, so the entire building was destroyed. 

It’s not clear how many people were killed, the rubble is still being cleared, but so far, we know that at least 3 people were killed, potentially 4, as just an hour ago there was a report of another body being retrieved from the rubble, but it might be a body of one of the 3 people, the message wasn’t clear about it. Also at least 8 people were injured, but most likely more, because some reports were talking about 30 casualties. What do the Russian bastards think they will achieve by killing civilians here and there? Do they still not understand that killing civilians is pointless? How the fuck can they be so stupid.

And then Putin in his speech today was talking about protecting civilians in Donbas right after deliberately killing civilians in Donbas with a missile just the day before. Then he was talking about how German tanks are “yet again attacking Russia”, so basically saying that Nazis are attacking them and that Russians are the victims. It’s just that he somehow doesn’t understand that in this situation he’s the Hitler, not the other way around. He was also saying that Russia is fighting “for the truth” what kind of a twisted parody of truth are they fighting for? The one where they live in an alternate reality and fighting against Nazi Ukraine with their best buddies North Korea and Eritrea? They love talking about truth, but they only spew lies.

Allegations of brutal interrogations, where Ukrainian men were shot and threatened with rape, have been made by a former Russian military officer.

Konstantin Yefremov, the most senior officer to speak openly, told the BBC in an exclusive interview Russia now sees him as a traitor and defector.

At one site in southern Ukraine, he said ""the interrogations, the torture, continued for about a week"".

There is simply no data of any significant troop movements by satellites nor third party intel. The movement and gathering of hundreds of thousands of troops would not go unnoticed. 

One likely scenario is that Ukraine wants to keep the current level of aid coming. Ukraine needs to play up the invader's capabilities to achieve that.  

Of course it is also likely that russia has indeed increased their offensive presence in the frontlines as Ukraine has reported. Whether that will ever translate to a larger coordinated push remains to be seen.

Bakhmut might be the last city they destroy/conquer, and then what? Repeat the meatgrinder strategy with another city? At this pace, Ukraine’s east would become a moonscape, and Russia will be in a demographic death-spiral if they aren’t already.

The West has poured far too much support into Ukraine to ever let Kiev or Kharkiv fall. The West will intervene directly if Kiev or Kharkiv are looking like it could fall due to some unexpectedly successful mobilization, training, and offensive push, by Russia along the northern front.

So, that leaves the scenario of an eventual stalemate where neither side can push offensively, for a time, but Ukraine will eventually win as their material supplies from their Allies continue to outpace Russia’s capacity to keep up.

Russia is hoping their campaign of terror of rocketing residential targets will bring Ukraine to the table, but that is as deluded as their predictions for a war to end in under a week. That delusion is really powering their only hope of an eventual political victory that sees Ukraine giving up the land-bridge, Crimea, and the eastern Donbas region. But it is just a delusion.

90% prisoners, who are not surviving their 6 months to buy their freedom.

10% elite forces, so at least they can capitalize on the meat shield, because regular forces themselves are still too incompetent.

> Are these the newly mobilised 300,000 ?

Generally, no. They're not motivated or trained well enough to attack.

The mobilks at first (the ones that got 2 days training and then shipped off to the front lines), were meat shields to stop the Ukrainian advances at the time. This wasn't too many.

The rest, since then, have completed their training, and are largely plugging the defensive lines. It's easier to get them to hold a line than advance.

The elites are doing the attacking.

> It's hard to believe there isn't more uprest in Russia over what is effectively sending father's / son's on a suicide mission.

It's still relatively small numbers of them honestly, it's not like WW2 when every block knew someone who'd died. It's just barely noticeable. And there's no information about how widespread it is (not that much, but, more than they know).

With the Wagner prisoners, their families aren't even paid a death bonus, they're just hoping to survive 6 months to wipe their slate clean (practically none of them are making it that long). So they're just gone. And, lots of them, ehn, they're already disowned, or excommunicated, or, not part of their families lives anyways. That's how they got into a life that led to being in prison.

For Ukraine, this might as well be a world war - the stakes are the same for them as for powers in WW1 or WW2 that faced the total defeat of their country or even genocide at the hands of tyrannical invaders, and brought forwards far larger numbers. WW1 France was a similar size to modern Ukraine in population, facing a similar situation (a part of its territory occupied and a gruelling stalemate against an invader) and they conscripted 8 million people and lost 1.4 million.

Russia through its insanity is treating it as an existential fight as well even though they could withdraw at any time.

On top of that, a lot of Russian people actually believe all the Kremlin propaganda. That's a double edged sword. On the one hand it helps Putin retain power and explain what's happening. But on the other hand, it prevents Putin, or anyone else, from withdrawing from the war.  

When people have suggested anything but a total conquest some of those people who have *really* taken the propaganda to heart have branded such people as traitors to Russia and Putin, as cowards, Nazi supporters, as being weak and in league with the West.

Then there are those who support Putin. For some of them they think that Putin is better than the alternatives.

The fall of the Soviet Union when money was worthless and children starved is not something they wish to revisit. Things can *always* get worse for the Russian public.

Russia has decided that the airspace is generally too hot for manned combat sorties, and has decided that missiles and drones are sufficient.  And that is in response to a relatively limited number of AA systems that Ukraine has been able to cobble together.  
  
The implication is that the situation would be mostly the same, if not considerably worse for Ukraine.  For F16s to make a difference, it would require the full SEAD doctrine - dozens, if not hundreds of combat and ISR aircraft in the skies at all times, able to respond in real time to new AA and BVR threats in order to make combat sorties acceptably survivable.  And that would just be to provide cover for the attack aircraft.  This is no easy feat.  It requires training pilots, analysts, operators, and leadership on not just the new weapons, but in doctrine, surveillance, comms and intelligence as well.  It's a big lift which would tie up critical resources for likely a year or more.  
  
Reading between the lines though, it sounded to me like the implication was ""$60M for an F-16 buys quite a lot of drones and missiles.""  That would again give Ukraine a degree of offensive parity with Russia, who is employing unmanned standoff weapons instead of combat aircraft for the most part.

Slow end, quick end, either way this ends with the US supplying arms to Ukraine essentially *in perpetuity*.  Once this war is over, Ukraine needs to completely retool and rearm - that's a massive opportunity for MIC.  But guess what?  They also need to rebuild, *and* exploit natural resources in the Donbas and Black Sea.  Those are also opportunities that can't be exploited right now because it's an active war zone.

The money argument makes *no sense* for dragging this out.  If it ends sooner, that's sooner that American companies can lean in, lend a helping hand, and make bank.  The MIC makes bank either way.  Russia is fucked either way, and giving them the bitter taste of defeat works better than a sniff of victory.

More importantly the longer you drag it out the more likely the administration changes hands and the sales come to an abrupt halt under under a Trump or a DeSantis (the latter, I really don't know).  So dragging it out might kill your revenue stream; ending it should not.

You may think that countries do not do enough to help Ukraine, but that is not the same as wanting Russia to not lose.

There are things that slow down military aid:

1. Lack of excess war material. Denmark just announced that they are donating all their artillery to Ukraine. That is a sacrifice of their own defense to help Ukraine and that is a scary move.
2. Fear of the war expanding into more countries. I think this fear is greatly exaggarate, but it still exists.
3. Fear of losing access to raw materials that will crash the local economies. As supply chains move elsewhere, this is less of a risk, but it's still a risk.
4. Russian influence on local opinion (Italy? Switzerland? Hungary?) that makes it politically risky to do too much.

The west is completely unprepared for this type of conflict, we always assumed in any conflict we'd have total air superiority.


Additionally, I think logistics plays a big role in why the west is drip feeding support to Ukraine.

If we'd just send them 1000 tanks at once, it would be an absolute nightmare trying to integrate that into the Ukraine army and logistics platform. But if we just send a 100,get them all integrated and let the Ukraine army figure out how best to use them and adapt to them, then we can send 100 more and they'll adapt much faster.


When it comes to sending jets, we'd have to send a large number for it to really make a difference due to all the anti air Russia has, jets and pilots are too valuable to risk. Sending 10 jets will just either be useless, or they'd get shot down.

But that missile is huge and hideously expensive and isn't want they're going to be using for trying to shoot down aircraft on a regular basis, it's literally for shooting down satellites in very low earth orbit. So they're only going to be using the one that has a range something over 200 km, maybe up to 250 km. Then keep in mind you can't put your S 400 right on the Belarusian border or Ukraine would take it out with artillery.

So you probably need to put your S 400 around 100 km from the border to be safe which means all the sudden you're lucky if you can shoot down a target 150 km into Ukraine since your missile has at most a 250 km range. And ground scatter means that detecting low altitude targets is going to be impossible well below max detection range of the radar and conversely the higher a plane is flying your missile loses range because it has to climb to altitude.

Long story short no ground based Russian anti aircraft system in Belarus is covering most of Ukraine, not even close. They probably extend 100-150 km into Ukraine at most I would guess, Ukraine is a pretty big country, that would leave a lot of space that Russia can't reach.

When you follow OSINT accounts on Twitter (good unbiased ones that don’t report rumors) you will see how FAST China is pumping out naval ships, and how many. Why would China need that many ships and that fast. Some people say their navy is now bigger than USAs. We all know China is not being invaded by anyone so it’s not to defend their homelands. It’s to project power outwards. There’s also OSINT accounts that had satellite photos of a mock enemy naval base (that matched to perfection a main Tawain naval base) in the Chinese desert and China was practicing how to hit it with missiles from the same distances they would face in a war. That’s a very specific practice run, especially at the same time as your rhetoric goes up and you push the issue to the front of the agenda.

Moreover, the greater the total range of the shot, the longer you need to maintain a lock.

A long-range shot will still take a minute or more to hit the target, and up to several minutes at absolute maximum range, and any loss of lock in that time produces a really massive possible error as it manoeuvres.

That is news to me.  Article 5.  I am not an international law lawyer.  The US constitution says ""only congress can declare war"".  Ratifying the North Atlantic Treaty was just guaranteeing that congress would take that action.  

I believe anything that carries the weight of NATO's article five would be adequate.  Something like the World Trade Organization (WTO) or Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would mediate the details.  If you invade anyone then all trade deals are off and need to be renegotiated.  

Some detail like what happens to a ship already unloading and/or ships already in route could get really complex.  That complexity is a good thing because it makes global business feel a sense of panic when the prospect of a war is looming.  There are fewer CEOs than young rape victims and CEOs can quickly recover.  It is just a few profits.

If Russia wins, it is still debatable that it comes at too high of a cost to Russia. We can’t factor in the well-being of the average Russian if we want to evaluate whether or not Russia comes out of this conflict better off. We need to only evaluate their leaders’ wealth and power, Russian resource exports, and Russian foreign influence. 

We also need to take into consideration that Ukraine could possibly remain Russian for a 50 years stretch afterwards, and also take into account what it means to Russia’s reputation and influence globally to have still overcome all of the “West’s interference”.

Further, a Russian victory demonstrates to Europe that Russia is capable of winning against a determined Western opponent armed with endless amounts of sophisticated weapons, because they were able to still mount effective human wave and artillery offensives even in the 22nd century. Russia would be considered a significant power again, even despite their military shortcomings so far. It makes future European conflicts far more likely. 

The playbook for invading a NATO country has already been played out. Just look at 2014 Ukraine, Brexit, Turkey’s shaky NATO behaviour, Trump, etc… Russia only needs to sow enough political discontent to empower some Russian sympathizers into control of the country, and then begin depositing enough Russian speaking populations or propaganda among their targeted NATO neighbour, in order to start pushing geographic or political boundaries again. 

They’ll wear their enemies down long enough, and their enemies may fall apart just enough for Russia to walk in with relative ease, and NATO may not do shit about it because by then their invaded ally will have already begun rejecting NATO’s “assistance”. Or Russia just stages a coup with some masked men in green uniforms again. Something will inevitably happen to the Baltic states, Moldova, and/or any other vulnerable countries, if Russia wins Ukraine. Stopping Russia here prevents additional future conflicts. It is great for Europe and Asia that we finally have a situation where Russia has miscalculated the timing of an invasion, because it allows the West to finally put a complete stop to the slow creep of Russian imperialism which has been ongoing since Chechnya.
