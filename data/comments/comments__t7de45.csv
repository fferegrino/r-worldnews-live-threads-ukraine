Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has demanded a new round of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters. He has been discussing the situation with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who is in eastern Europe.


The International Monetary Fund has announced it could approve $1.4 billion emergency funding as early as next week as the body warns of war’s ‘severe impact’ on the global economy.

The United Nations recorded 351 civilians killed and 707 injured just on Friday in Ukraine, according to the UN high commissioner for human rights, as reported by BuzzFeed.

Russia and Ukraine plan another round of talks on Monday, even though previous talks that produced an agreement to a limited ceasefire in order to protect corridors for civilian have not been honored by Russia.

The US government has warned American citizens living or travelling in Russia to “depart immediately”, in new guidelines, published today, by the US state department.

Volodymyr Zelenskiy reportedly made a “desperate plea” for eastern Europe to provide Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine. In a call with US senators, he is also understood to have called for a no-fly zone, lethal aid, a ban on Russian oil and a suspension of Visa and Mastercard in Russia.

The Associated Press reported:

At the refugee center, America’s top diplomat heard harrowing tales from mothers and their children who described long and perilous journeys and the shock of the sudden disruption and the fear for their lives after fleeing the devastation of the war.

“Near our home we heard bombs,” said Venera Ahmadi, 12, who said she came with her brother and sister, six dogs and seven cats from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, more than 600 kilometers (372 miles) away. “We walked to the border, I don’t know how many hours. We crossed the border on foot.”

Her 16-year-old sister, Jasmine, said: “I was scared I would die.”
Natalia Kadygrob, 48, reached the center with her four adopted children from Kropyvnytskyi, almost 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) by bus on their way to her brother’s home in Germany. Her husband stayed behind.

“There they bombed planes at the airport,” she said. “Of course we were afraid.”

Tatyana, 58, who wouldn’t give her last name, came with her daughter, Anna, 37, and her 6- and 1-year-old daughters, Katya and Kira, from Kharkiv, about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away. “They were shooting on the street,” Tatyana said. Anna said her home had been destroyed by a shell or a rocket.

She was in the basement with her daughters when the explosion happened. “They should be in school,” Anna said. “They are children, they don’t understand.”

Blinken then met with Kuleba on a visit to the Korczowa border crossing where Polish authorities escorted small groups of refugees about 20 at a time across the frontier from the Ukrainian town of Krakovets as sporadic snow flakes fell from a gray sky.

Groups mainly of women, children and elderly men grimly rolling their possessions in luggage and carrying infants and the occasional family pet made their way into makeshift processing centers set up in tents on Polish territory.

Bryan Armen Graham reports for Guardian US:

Brittney Griner, one of America’s most decorated women’s basketball players, has reportedly been detained by Russian Federal Customs Service authorities after the discovery of vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow.

The Customs Service confirmed “the detainee is a professional basketball player” who played in the Women’s National Basketball Association and won two Olympic gold medals with the United States in a statement issued on Saturday, but did not release the player’s name.

Russia’s TASS news agency identified the player as Griner, a seven-time All-Star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury who helped lead the United States to gold medals at the Rio and Tokyo Olympic Games, citing a law enforcement source.

“By accusing Ukraine of breaking the agreement, Russia is likely seeking to shift responsibility for current and future civilian casualties in the city,” the British defence ministry said in an intelligence update.

Russia said earlier it had opened humanitarian corridors near the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha and, according to RIA news agency, Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian “nationalists” of preventing civilians from leaving.

But Mariupol’s city council said Russia was not observing the ceasefire.

Russia just shows their hand in the worst way possible. I understand this is a way to garner public pressure for the lifting of sanction but they have miscalculated in the worst way possible.

For one, war can not be declared until someone fires a shot. Even if Russia said sanctions declared war, the west can deny it and war only begins if they are attacked by Russia, thus russia declaring war. Which no side wants for obvious reasons.

Secondly they chose careful wording, “equivalent” instead of just sayin war was declared. Because they know that that would be way to far and actually be at risk of causing ww3.

The Labour leader said the Russian president is “afraid of everything that we are most proud of” and his invasion of Ukraine is “an affront to the values of this country”, reports PA.

Addressing the Scottish Labour conference in Glasgow, Starmer said the UK must target oligarchs and remove their money and influence from British politics.

He said Ukrainian courage is “inspiring the world, just as the actions of Putin repel the world”. The west, he said, would have to “make sacrifices” to oppose the invasion.

He said:

The events we are witnessing right now will stay with us forever. These are dark days, peace in Europe has been threatened by an imperialist aggressor.

Images I didn’t think I would see in my lifetime - Russian tanks rolling into a European country, soldiers kissing their children goodbye, as they stay to fight, and families fleeing for the border.

He called for “the strongest sanctions” against Putin - including against oligarchs and their money in the UK.

We know Putin’s playbook. He seeks division so we must meet him with unity.

He believes the benefits of aggression outweigh the consequences so we must take a stand. And he believes the West is too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can.

In response, the BBC said ""access to accurate, independent information is a fundamental human right which should not be denied to the people of Russia, millions of whom rely on BBC News every week"".

Record numbers of people have read the BBC's Russian language news website since the invasion.

Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba just met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the Ukraine-Poland border and America’s top diplomat briefly crossed over into Ukraine with his counterpart.

The two met for 45 minutes under high security at a border crossing full of refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion, Agence France Press noted.

They emerged to speak to the media briefly and make a powerful visual statement standing side by side. They also gave bullish remarks, although Kuleba’s was heavily-qualified, with warnings that his citizens would pay the price if the Nato allies did not impose a no-fly zone to keep Russia’s military out of Ukraine’s skies and if the world tired of imposing sanctions on Vladimir Putin and Russia.

Kuleba said: ““Ukraine will win this war anyway, because this is the people’s war for their land...The question is the price.”

Blinken traveled to Europe earlier in the week and met leaders of the Nato military alliance and leaders of the European Council, the policy-making body of European Union, in Brussels yesterday, before traveling east to Poland.

Standing outside on the Polish-Ukrainian border moments ago, Blinken said he believe that Ukraine is “going to prevail” in the face of Russia’s invasion late last month.

But the United States, and Nato, have repeatedly said in the last 24 hours that they would not implement a no-fly zone over Ukraine because it would lead to the western allies having to shoot down Russian aircraft, bringing Nato members directly into conflict with Russia, which the alliance is adamant it will avoid.

Standing next to Blinken, Kuleba said of that policy: “I think it’s a sign of weakness...It’s the people of Ukraine who will pay the price for the reluctance of Nato to act.

AFP added:

The top Ukraine diplomat expressed gratitude for global coordination in placing hefty sanctions on Russia in support of Ukraine.

But he expressed concern that countries would grow weary of implementing those sanctions, especially as they also have an economic impact on the countries enforcing them.

“Ukraine will win this war anyway, because this is the people’s war for their land... The question is the price,” Kuleba said.

“If our partners continue to take bold systemic decisions to step up economic and political pressure... if they continue to provide us with necessary weapons, the price will be lower,” he said.

However, he said: “If anyone in the world one day starts feeling sanctions fatigue, for example, then more people in Ukraine will be dying, suffering.”

Read everything before taking action. 

The **resistance** in Russia needs help from people OUTSIDE Russia - if they themselves post anything on social media about the war they can now get 15 years in prison! There is a cry for help by well informed, especially young Russians who want to protest the war to spread information of when protests are taking place! **To protest most safely they depend on the safety of numbers!** 

This is a very real and alive resistance movement boiling underneath the Russian state and state controlled propaganda. Earlier this week, the already imprisoned opposition leader, Alexey Navalny has called for protests on Twitter where he addressed the Russian people - and he was specific about time. The places below are the  main squares for protets he also suggested. 

THE MAIN PROTEST IS ON SUNDAY AT 14:00 (2 PM). Time is now of the essence!

IMPORTANT:
You need to use creative ways to get through to Russians as Facebook, Twitter and many other websites have now been suspended. 

- Use Russian groups on Telegram, underground groups in Russia are also known to use these. 
- Use gaming chat rooms. 
- Use sites like TripAdvisor.ru and pick random places in cities you can find on Google Maps and spread information via reviews. 
- You can use Instagram and WhatsApp as these are still not banned in Russia, but the message needs to reach Russians in Russian. 
- If you are aware of other sites still **that allow posting** in Russia please suggest these - Google translate can be used to translate an entire Russian site into English. 

English translation of message:

Protest the war! Saturday at 14:00. Do not let fear be greater than your conscience. Save lives and our future. Spread the word!

Putin is afraid of freedom. Freedom, democratic, free speech, peoples right. Having free countries at his doorstep scares the shit out of him, because his people could get a taste of it and want it too. 

Putin is not worried about having a border with Nato. He knows full well Nato would never attack him. He doesn’t want a border with a free country. He wants a buffer zone of lesser dictators around him, so he can show the Russians how great he is.

### Sanitizing Water of Microorganisms:
***

**Note: This method will not work for water contaminated with chemicals or radiation!**

According to the the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water) you can sanitize water to make it safe for drinking, cooking, and hygiene.

Please download this [PDF](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/documents/emergency_disinfection_of_drinking_water_sept2017.pdf) from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/emergency-disinfection-drinking-water) infographic and keep it with you and share it with whom you can.

The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/making-water-safe.html) also provides information on how to sanitize water of microorganisms to make it safe for use.

Here is the [PDF](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/pdf/make-water-safe-during-emergency-p.pdf) to the infographic from the CDC.

Russian forces have advanced rapidly on the eastern outskirts of Kyiv, likely from the Sumy axis, and may attempt to encircle and/or attack the capital on the east bank of the Dnipro in the coming 24-48 hours. Russian troops did not press a ground offensive against Kharkiv in the last 24 hours but have instead diverted forces to the west and southeast, likely supporting efforts against Kyiv and in and around Donbas respectively. Russian troops have surrounded Mariupol and are attacking it brutally to destroy it or compel its capitulation. Russian forces have renewed their ground advance on Mykolayiv, having secured Kherson city, likely to set conditions for a further attack toward Odesa. Russian naval infantry are likely poised to conduct amphibious landings near Odesa when Russian forces have secured or are close to securing a reliable ground route from Crimea to Odesa.

The Kremlin dramatically limited Russia’s already isolated domestic information environment and criminalized unfavorable coverage of the war in Ukraine on March 4, setting conditions to improve the domestic efficacy of its information operations. Ukraine is attempting to increase the flow of information about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to Russian citizens to increase domestic Russian opposition to the war. The Kremlin set conditions to justify potential Russian conscriptions and more aggressive operations in Ukraine. The Russian Defense Ministry said foreign citizens fighting for Ukraine will not be considered legal combatants and will not be protected under international law. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko reiterated that Belarus will not enter the war in Ukraine but has likely already committed Belarusian troops. NATO rejected Ukraine’s request to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Russia has not yet followed through on its agreement with Ukraine to establish the humanitarian corridors that would enable civilian supply and evacuation. The US Department of Defense established a deconfliction line with its Russian counterpart to prevent accidental escalation near the Ukrainian and Belarusian borders. Finland and Sweden continued high-level discussions on NATO membership and multilateral defense measures.

Media outlets need to be careful with phrasing like this and have someone vet the original Russian language and frame it appropriately, because it matters. ""like a declaration of war"" could be more metaphoric. ""equivalent of"" can mean being considered the same as. The phrasing matters a lot, for example it could mean what everyone is going to jump to, he is considering it a declaration of war, but the meaning (especially first two) could also mean (in English, with that phrasing) to emphasize the severity of the sanctions, in the sense of ""the sanctions are like a kick to the nards"".

Putin Says No-Fly Zone Would Mean NATO Entering the War

Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated his warnings against a NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine.

On Friday NATO rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s call for a no-fly zone to avoid being drawn into a war with Russia.",False,1646509842.0,t3_t7de45,t3_t7de45,,0,10,0,10,0,0,

We need to show facts at every  comments section especially at russian news media controlled by Kremlin regime.  We need to spread the news everywhere and the truth will be told to Russians. It seems that Russian authorities has its own propaganda and the Russians do not know what is the reality in Ukraine. We can get online in touch with Russians telling them and sharing videos and any information that can open their eyes. There are many proofs that there is no ""special military operation"" and actually there is a war. Show them videos with towns bombarded and ruined,  kids in tears, shocking videos with dead bodies of kids, women, men being killed by Russian troops and videos where russian soldiers are not welcomed with flowers as Kremlin propaganda says and instead of that they are welcomed as Invaders and occupiers. Let's make this happen. Share this message in every subreddit and hopefully the truth will reach to Russians.

This would likely give some operational advantage to the Russians since it would protect their convoys from Bayraktars and Ukrainian Sukhois & MiGs. And let's mention a NFZ ignores Russian artillery, which shells Ukraine regardless; Currently, Ukrainians can strike Russian artillery from the air if the opportunity presents itself.

What Ukraine really wants? Western nations to join the war in their defense (a no-Russian zone), and more weapons & reloads to shoot down the aforementioned trash. No-Fly Zones may be sexy sounding, but really they're just *a* step towards joining the conflict for Ukraine and Moscow will consider it a declaration of war anyway. (Source on that one: BBC is reporting Putler has referred to a NFZ as a declaration of war.)

Also, I'm willing to bet the contested air is wreaking havoc on Russian aircraft even if they survive the flight. First, flying low and fast is not fuel efficient (and it gets expensive logistically to ship more JP). Second, the more wear and tear from use, the more you need to repair.

-Their nukes could be in the same state.

If Nato intervenes, Putin will launch nuclear weapons at minimum of 30 different countries including the UK and US. In response, Russia will be destroyed, but millions, if not billions of us will die. First from the initial impact, which will wipe people out immediately. Then those just outside of that will experience horrific burns and will die shortly after. In the days, weeks, months and years that follow, more will die from radiation and cancer. The water will be radioactive and dangerous. If the ecosystem collapses, those not impacted, will die from disease and starvation. The world as we know it, will never be the same again. If we live, the pain of the loss of friends and family, will not make us want to. This is what Zelensky demands and this is why Nato is not doing anything. 
Parading POW's and having them crying on camera does not look good and people don't agree with this spectacle, arming women and children then saying Putin is killing civilians also is a losing PR move. Russia offering a ceasefire to evacuate civilians which he doesn't acknowledge is also down to him and blaming the West does not go down well either. Russia warned Ukraine but Zelensky wouldn't listen and still won't, more will die and the blood is on his hands and his hands alone as he could stop this now before more lives are lost in a war he has no chance of winning.

ca64469d90c26a9c76cfc631cc1ccde8,t7de45,hzh5ukw,"IRPIN, Ukraine—Every day for the past week, Russian forces have tried to fight their way through this suburb of Kyiv to reach the Ukrainian capital. And every day, Ukrainian troops have forced them to retreat, leaving burning tanks and armored personnel carriers behind.    


“We go out to hunt and destroy them,” said Volodymyr, a Ukrainian special-forces team leader, as his squad, armed with a British .308 sniper rifle and British-made antitank weapons, waited for the latest Russian attack. “They certainly didn’t come here expecting that, expecting that we know how to fight.”

The front lines here have largely held fast since the first day of the war, on Feb. 24, when a Russian column pushed in from Belarus to the north. In some places, including the neighboring town of Bucha, the Russians have been pushed back.    


“Ukraine is fighting in a way nobody expected, not the Russians and not our Western partners,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser and member of Kyiv’s delegation at cease-fire talks with Russia. “Kyiv was supposed to have fallen in three days.  


”In part, that is because Ukraine has deployed elite special-forces units, trained by the U.S. and allies over the past several years, to defend Kyiv. Armed with British NLAW and American-made Javelin antitank weapons and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, they have helped blunt the Russian advantage in aviation and long-range missiles and artillery.  


But Kyiv is also holding because the Russian forces here seem to have stuck to Soviet-style large maneuver tactics, moving in long convoys that are vulnerable to strikes by small reconnaissance units and by Ukraine’s fleet of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 armed drones, Ukrainian officers said.  


“We’re in shock at how dumb their behavior is,” said another member of the Ukrainian special-forces unit who has been going on missions in the area every night. His unit, he said, had lost two soldiers since the war began nine days ago, and killed more than 60 Russians in recent days. “Now, we mostly focus on hitting their rear, their supply convoys, because if they don’t get fuel, they can’t do anything.  


”Morale among Ukrainian defenders was high in Irpin on Friday, even as a Russian attack airplane flew low over a housing block and sounds of artillery rounds landing got closer and closer. Big plumes of black smoke rose to the north and south of town, along other major routes where Russian forces have been trying for more than a week to break into Kyiv.  


Cloud cover has hampered Russia’s use of combat helicopters, soldiers here said. But to be prepared in case enemy choppers or attack planes approached, one of the soldiers took a position with a portable antiaircraft missile on his shoulder. Troops here say they operate their own small drones, including some with thermal cameras, to hunt for Russian targets.  


“The Russians keep trying to enter and to encircle us, but they just can’t. We are together, we are organized, and we are strong-willed,” said Alyona Pavlova, an Irpin native and a soldier who was helping evacuate civilians from the town on Friday. “It’s a real war—and nobody was really ready at first, because nobody really believed that Russia would do something this mad.”

Ukrainian and foreign civilians have been streaming out of Irpin and cities beyond that are under Russian control, walking toward the relative safety of Kyiv despite shelling and airstrikes.  


With a bridge over the Irpin River blown up, they have to climb down and under the span and then navigate a precarious pathway, their suitcases and pets in their hands. There was no formal agreement with Russia on the humanitarian corridor here, Ukrainian soldiers said, and the risk of a Russian shell hitting the area, something that happened before, was constant.  


“I’ve spent seven days hiding in a shelter, but today the power went off and enough is enough,” said Mykhailo, a screenwriter who hiked with two backpacks for more than an hour from the other side of Irpin, near the next town of Bucha. He declined to provide his surname.  


“The Russians are hitting everywhere, and it’s blowing up just outside my home now,” he said. It is the second time Mykhailo said he has had to move. He fled his hometown of Luhansk after pro-Russian forces took it over in 2014.  


Tanya Rybko and her two children spent the entire morning walking from the town of Hostomel north of here. Russian forces control several parts of town, while Ukrainians are deployed in others. “And tonight, we were right in the middle of it all, between the two sides,” she said.  


Russian troops, she added, had taken over a nearby apartment building, holding civilians hostage and seizing their phones so residents don’t phone in tips to Ukrainian troops. Hungry, the Russian forces were also looting local stores and homes, looking for food, she said.

Mohammad Amin, a Tunisian information-technology specialist, has been living in Ukraine for the past 10 years. On Friday, Mr. Amin, his Ukrainian wife and their 4-year-old son, with a small suitcase in tow, left the apartment they had purchased in Irpin and walked for nearly an hour to the bridge, hoping to get to Kyiv and then on to the European Union.  


“I just cannot sit in the shelter anymore,” Mr. Amin said, out of breath. “The Russians, they are just jealous. They feel themselves defeated, and so they are just hitting apartments with civilians in them. They know very well where civilians live.  


”He pointed to Ukrainian soldiers guarding the bridge, with bright-yellow tape on their helmets. “And these people,” he said, “they are heroes. Believe me, I am telling the truth.”",False,1646503120.0,t3_t7de45,t1_hzh2hrx,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

> - Sending equipment to Ukraine should not be done

What else would he say. However, and most critically, he did not say this was an act of war. Essentially, that's Putin going on the record he won't escalate to a war with NATO over the sending of equipment.

> - Sanctions = war

That's not what he said, he said they could be like war, but that we are not yet at this stage. So once again, he equivocates rather than taking the most aggressive stance. 

> - Wants a total economic freedom and urge the west to unfreeze the assets 

Again, what else would he say? Fact is, once again he did not layer this with any direct threats.

Additionally, he did say that anyone trying to enforce a no-fly zone would be entering the conflict. But that is in line with NATO's position on this. And really, that's also just a simple fact. If you shoot down a Russian plane over Ukraine, you're entering the war. So not exactly an escalating statement.

Lastly, there have been no hints or threats about the use of nuclear weapons. So all in all, it appears that we're moving to a slightly more stable position. Putin has apparently accepted the lethal weapon shipments from NATO, while NATO has accepted that they will not interfere with a no-fly zone. Additionally, there is a deconfliction hotline set up and working, so that any tactical mistakes on either side can immediately be dealt with. 


My guess is that Putin feels more secure at home since there have not been massive uprisings. In essence, he has retained and increased control over Russia and with the outright propaganda he can essentially set any narrative. I mean, look at Trump, he lost the elections but he and the conservative right wing in the US are perpetuating the lie that he didn't. What's the stop Putin from simply declaring the mission successful and then perpetuating that narrative? Not much, as it stands.

These missile attack warnings were suspected to be false alarms by Stanislav Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces on duty at the command center of the early-warning system. He decided to wait for corroborating evidence—of which none arrived—rather than immediately relaying the warning up the chain-of-command. This decision is seen as having prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack against the United States and its NATO allies, which would likely have resulted in an escalation to a full-scale nuclear war. Investigation of the satellite warning system later determined that the system had indeed malfunctioned.

With Ukraine becoming more westernised/democratic/considering joining NATO/EU (which I believe they have joined EU now) right on Russias boarder, that is a perceived threat from the west to Russia, as how they would see it. 

Russia would probably also see any sanction as further evidence to back this up, that the west are against them and trying to quash them and their values.

But to give your question a thought exercise, lets say there's a rebellion, maybe even a civil war, within Russia. And lets say the anti-Putin forces were to overthrow the oligarchy... What happens next?

In my opinion, what will happen during is NATO potential involvement in supporting the Anti-Putin forces. Weapon, training, supplies, etc. But even if NATO didn't intervene, we would still have some influence on the newly established Government. The uproar may cause a sharp divide post-war in Russia and we will likely start seeing some Russian Republics start splitting off from the mainland with outside (China) support. Those new Republics with leftover USSR Nuclear weapons, btw. 

This could cause some serious tensions, moreso than usual, between US and China and their allies (N. Korea). Which, again. Nukes.

Where people have no idea how the mechanism of their politics both domestic or international work.

They have never given much thought or paid much attention to why certain institutions were created or how they've evolved over time.

They've heard them mentioned in the news and probably learned about them for a few days way back in high school. Then just went on about their lives with false conceptions that they assume to be 100% true. And over time those conceptions become more and more watered down by a lack of attention.

Then all of a sudden something happens where they realize they do care or at least that they probably should. And then they blame the institutions without ever really understanding what they are, how they work, and most importantly why they work that way.

It's why you see so many people complaining about appeasement and comparing this to WW2 while completely ignoring the fact that the last 80+ years of history mean the world is nothing like the one that existed in the late 1930s.

I take it as a reflection that people \*want\* the west to be helping Ukraine more, and keeping it in the narrative (even if it's a bit of an extreme view) provides pressure on politicians to trend in that direction.

Obviously, the President is not going to be making specific policy decisions like the NFZ off of this, but saying it doesn't affect public narrative/opinion, and by extension policy making to trend a bit more in a certain direction generally speaking (i.e., supply more aid to Ukraine), is a bit false imo.",False,1646502162.0,t3_t7de45,t1_hzh2qnw,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

You take a few good high altitude SAM systems, turn them on. Ukraine did this. Then, you let your enemy run out of guided cruise missiles and swap to fixed wings. However, they can't fly high because if they do, they're targeted by the radar system for a near 100% certainty kill.

So, their only option is to get low, below minimum radar altitude. However, to do that limits you to subsonic speeds. Low and subsonic are the requirements for the Stinger. Now, it's good but it's an older, man portable guided missile so it's nowhere near a guaranteed hit. Likewise, planes are flying below radar so detection is visual only. So, the pilots take the risk (or are ordered to) and run the gauntlet.

What they seem to have underestimated is how many Stingers Ukraine has, how liberally they'll use them, and how good with them they are. Enough, clearly, that they're able to get opportunities to use them against off radar targets.

IBM interceptors are really only reliable near the origin of launch. The rocket exhaust is easy to see and they're moving relatively slow. Interception after the warhead has separated is extremely difficult and the best US systems are probably only like 50/50. Further, a given warhead can split into several (aka, Multiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicles, MIRVs), they can easily overwhelm defense systems.

>nuclear winter

That theory generally requires all out exchanges between multiple countries. Enough that enough infrastructure and surrounding forest burns, generating incredible volumes of smoke. Think of all the nuclear tests that happened and no nuclear winter. Think of the two bombs dropped on Japan, no nuclear winder. It's at best a remote possibility even in an all out exchange of nukes.

>Is the hesitance to engage directly really about the nukes?

It's about the risk of escalation. Russia doesn't have a particularly robust military, NATO would utterly destroy it in any conventional battle. It would be a humiliating defeat for Russia and they'd be *tempted* to stay in the conflict through the use of something like a tactical nuke.

This is why Russia fears NATO so much, because they're no match.

Most nuclear warheads are designed to destroy military harden targets - not destroy civilian cities. So they are purely focused on a relatively small destruction radius rather than designed for max civilian casualties. Also most nuclear warheads in a nuclear war is going to be used against nuclear strategic assets like submarine bases, bunkers, large military bases etc. They aren't going to be used against say a city of 1 million in Kanas with no military assets and their main export is wheat.

The technology we’ve seen used in this scenario has been described as “shooting a bullet with another bullet,” and it has been something like 50% effective. Which is okay if you’re facing one North Korean missile - less so against hundreds of incoming warheads.

The second is submarine launches. If one appears off shore of a major city, what defenses are in place to shoot a warhead down? There aren’t anti-missile batteries installed around London or New York or most places. 

As for nuclear winter, the concern is the amount of fires/debris kicked off by hundreds or thousands of explosions all at once.

They come down after reaching an orbital (not orbiting) altitude above Earth, at approximately 15,000 miles per hour. Within the head of the missile, you have MIRVs. Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles. Which means that each (about a dozen) warhead unseats from the head of the missile, and has a pre determined target. 

Contrary to popular belief, there is no way to actually intercept Nuclear Ballistic Missiles unless you are within 24 miles of the launch site. Which means anything launched from Russian ground based silos will hit. Some from Russian Submarines MIGHT get shot down, but only if the US Navy has AEGIS equipped ships within 24 miles of the submarine at launch.

Effectively the intelligence community was moderately sure that Russia was lying about their military capability and that, in the event of a war, they would suffer significant training, maintenance and logistics problems. 

They mainly though this because they had significant information portraying the military structure of Russia as being deeply corrupt, their soldiers were largely conscripted and did not have enough training/service time, they had far too few supply trucks for their stated forces, that their pilots were getting way less flight hours than they should be, amongst other stuff/etc.

The real surprise was not that these issues existed, but rather how extensive they were. Things like their tires ripping, the lack of radio and communication discipline, the lack of GPS, the food shortages, etc, were all things that I did not see predicted in the analyses I read.

>Ukraine is a sovereign nation, but that doesn't mean they can make decisions without thinking about how their neighbors would react.

That doesnt mean the reactions are justified. 

>Russia told Ukraine EU and NATO membership is a redline.

Russias red line is horseshit and should be treated as such. Russia has only one legitimate red line, it's own borders. Same goes with NATO, if you havent noticed. The Red line for NATO is NATO countries. If Russia wants to complain about USA's operations in Iraq and Syria, it has complete right to deliver arms and financial sanctions against USA. And it did.

>In 2008, NATO officially welcomed the inclusion of Ukraine, and that's where the trouble started. 

No, the trouble started when Ukrainians decided they wanted nothing to do with Putins puppet yanukovich.

>In addition, Ukraine is steadily trying to erode minority protection as seen in the repeal of the minority language laws. 

So has Russia. Russia has no right to complain about others countries minority treatment if it is actively disenfranchising it's own minorities.

> How is this neighborly?

How is Russias invasion neighbourly? why does everyone have to be neighbourly towards Russia, but Russia doesnt have to be neighbourly to anyone?

>Ukraine was free to do whatever it wanted prior to 2008 or even 2014.

And still is. 

>People make joining the EU such a great thing, but they are no different than Russia. 

Unlike Russia, EU isnt trying to force Ukraine to go with their way. If Ukraine legitimately wants to be with Russia, they can. 

>would have to adopt the policies of their benefactor, whether it's Russia or EU; it's no different.

yes it is.

Russia: You're with us whether you like it or not, we're not giving you the choice

It was more like:

- Trump lost and he wasn't supposed to. Putin was hoping his puppet would withdraw from NATO. 
- Covid happened, which delayed the plan.
- Putin opted to wait for Angela Merkel to step down as the most senior, experienced European leader who knew Putin for decades and spoke fluent Russian and could unite all of Europe.
- Meanwhile, Republicans cannot get their heads out of their asses and are taking advantage of the domestic chaos from nut-jobs like those who supported January 6th.

Also I learned that Ukraine haven’t really started their counteroffensive yet. So it’s very possible that they’re stocking up on foreign artillery and waiting a bit for the Russians to get even weaker before essentially ambushing them.

Bear in mind that’s mostly a hypothesis I’m throwing out there but I think we all need to remember strategy is super important when it comes to wars and battles. Similar to how we say Russia isn’t using their full force, neither is Ukraine at this point. We are mostly seeing infantry and defence from them. (And the reason why I think they haven’t been using their artillery is because it would contribute to the loss of civilian life and infrastructure.

- A significant portion of their air force may not be operable, and so what's at the front in Ukraine may represent a larger portion of available aircraft than thought. We have decent counts on what the USSR produced, but not the greatest insight into what condition it's in now.

- They may not have sufficient fuel, parts, pilots, or maintenance crews to actually use what they have frequently.

- They don't have the munitions to use that air force effectively. We've seen them flying low, dropping dumb (unguided) munitions in recent days. Which suggests they don't have enough available precision guided munitions to keep using them for much.

Their air force was taking pretty heavy losses yesterday, which I'm sure isn't improving the desire to use it heavily. This is a reasonably credible source: https://twitter.com/oryxspioenkop/status/1500134424368848899

9 lost aircraft (+ a UAV) in 24 hours is not exactly good. Especially not when a bunch of those were some of their newest.

- Lastly, sanctions are likely to hit their ability to make new munitions and aircraft, likely to cause shortages in certain parts for existing ones, etc.

I don't want war.  I certainly don't want *nuclear* war.  But in many ways this is *already* a nuclear war, as Putin is using nukes not as a defensive deterrent, but as an *offensive* deterrent.  Sanctions were the right first step, and it's good we came down as hard as we did, but if sanctions prove to be incapable of stopping this (as they appear to be), then Putin is creating a road map for ever nuclear authoritarian (North Korea, Iran, China, etc.) to follow in pursuit of their own goals.  We cannot allow Russia to get away with this.

It sucks that we're in the situation we're in, and there are a lot of geopolitically complex reasons why we've arrived at this point, there geopolitical complexity aside, the reality of the situation is morally simple: A relatively peaceful, relatively free, burgeoning democracy is withstanding an assault from a foreign aggressor and fighting for their very existence.  At a certain point - and I'm not saying we're at that point now, but it's rapidly approaching - we have a *moral imperative* to get involved.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and say we don't want to start World War 3, because *World War 3 may have very well already started*.

If your neighbor is beating their kid, you don't stay on your side of the fence and say 'well, they didn't pay their neighborhood watch dues'.  Putin is a bully and sometimes the only way to get the bully to back down is to fucking punch back.

There's no good way this ends.  My hope is that the Russian people take care of it themselves by overthrowing the Putin regime before this escalates to a point where we have to get involved.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

The war officially ended in July 2003, when the Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo took power. Although a peace agreement was signed in 2002, violence has continued in many regions of the country, especially in the east.

 >Estimates of the casualties from the Iraq War (beginning with the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the ensuing occupation and insurgency and civil war) have come in several forms, and those estimates of different types of Iraq War casualties vary greatly. Estimating war-related deaths poses many challenges. Experts distinguish between population-based studies, which extrapolate from random samples of the population, and body counts, which tally reported deaths and likely significantly underestimate casualties.

I’m Russian American and am plugged in with actual Russians in Russia that I’ve extensively spoken to in the last week in Russian (relatives, friends). I also check Russian media to see what they are seeing before I talk to them so my questions are more pointed. Americans truly do not understand the internal politics and climate that is going on here - they are isolated from this, and do not understand what makes this conflict so dangerous. The war propaganda is strong and he has backed himself into a corner politically - he knows this. I don’t think he gives any of this up - my belief is that he will be willing to make risky decisions and put everything towards securing eastern Ukraine. 

Ukraine is not part of NATO so nobody will retailiate in equal force on their behalf. The Russian people would see such a nuclear strike as difficult but morally necessary if conventional arms either fail or prove to be too costly - just like the U.S. nationalists see the nuclear strikes in Japan as morally necessary. The West will not retaliate since there is no treaty to do so and they will be unwilling to escalate into all our nuclear war.

I’m really hoping I’m wrong here, and I don’t mean to be alarmist, but this is the feeling I’m getting after getting closely in tune with the propaganda machine and the “all-in” mentality of the Putin loyalists.
