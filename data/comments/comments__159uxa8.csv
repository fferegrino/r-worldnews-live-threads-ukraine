>In an open test field in rural Ukraine, a drone equipped with a bomb lost connection with its human operator after coming under attack by electronic jamming equipment — but instead of crashing to the ground, the drone accelerated toward its target and destroyed it.

>The drone avoided the fate of thousands of other uncrewed aircraft in this war by relying on new artificial intelligence software that accounts for the electronic interference now commonly deployed by Russia, stabilizing the drone and keeping it locked on a preselected target. AI capabilities help the drone complete its mission even if its target moves, representing a significant upgrade from existing drones that track specific coordinates.

>Such AI technology, under development by a growing number of Ukrainian drone companies, is one of several innovative leaps underway in Kyiv’s domestic drone market that are accelerating and democratizing the lethality of unmanned warfare — especially crucial for Ukraine’s outgunned military, which is fighting a larger and better-equipped Russian enemy.
>
>The improvements in speed, flight range, payload capacity and other capabilities are having an immediate impact on the battlefield, enabling Ukraine to destroy Russian vehicles, blow up surveillance posts and even wreck parts of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s prized Crimean Bridge in an operation last week involving explosive-laden naval drones.

>The design and software innovations, as well as mass dissemination of piloting know-how, are also likely to influence the way drones are used far beyond the war in Ukraine.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-26-23/index.html?iid=fw_var-reg-hp-13

""Ukrainian forces have been able to wedge themselves in Russia’s first line of defense, with heavy and fierce fighting still ongoing amid a large offensive along the southern front in the Zaporizhzhia region, a Russian official has claimed.

“At least 100 armored vehicles have been used to attack by the enemy on the Orekhov [Russian spelling of Orikhiv] section of the Zaporizhzhya (Russian spelling of Zaporizhzhia) front,” a member of the Russian-installed Zaporizhzhia military-civilian administration, Vladimir Rogov, wrote on Telegram on Wednesday. “At the moment, as a result of several waves of attack near Rabotino [Russian spelling of Robotyne] with more than 100 units of armored vehicles, including tanks, BMPs, APCs and AFVs, the enemy managed to wedge in three sections of our first line of defense.”

Rogov went on to say Russian forces were using their full arsenal, including aviation strikes, to push back against the Ukrainian units carrying out the assault, which he claimed were Western equipped and trained. 

“The fighters of these brigades have been trained abroad, and the brigades themselves are equipped with Western military equipment, including Leopard tanks and Bradley BMPs,” he wrote. “Now there are heavy, fierce battles of high intensity going on in this area.”

Well-connected Russian military blogger Rybar says fighting in the area has slightly decreased in intensity, adding Russian forces have been able to hold their ground.

Some context: Russian-installed officials and military bloggers have claimed Ukrainian forces have launched a major offensive in the Zaporizhzhia region, to the south of Orikhiv, as they appear to build on modest gains in the area over the past couple of days.

>One of the difficulties in covering the Russo-Ukraine War as a journalist is the tendency of so many in this profession to assemble facts in favor of whatever the prevailing narrative of the day is. Sixteen months ago, it was hard to find many people in prominent Washington think tanks or at major broadsheets who did not think Kyiv would fall in three days. When it didn’t, those wedded to the notion that Russia was a near-indomitable military power still found the conventional wisdom, built up over years of diligent study and perhaps the unconscious assimilation of Russian propaganda, hard to slough off. Just because Kyiv wasn’t sacked and the Russian army was driven out of the capital region, ran this line of thinking, didn’t mean Ukraine hadn’t exhausted its inventory of miracles. It could not claw back more territory. Then Kharkiv happened. A wondrous bait-and-switch operation, to be sure, but a one-off for that very reason. The Russians were learning, adapting and preparing, and the long-shot play to retake Kherson would prove it. Then Russia withdrew from half of that region in November as a “goodwill gesture.” And so on.

>Having serially outperformed expectations, Ukraine finds itself in the unenviable position of having gone from scrappy underdog to victim of its own mythologized success. Six and a half weeks into a much-anticipated counteroffensive and there are no dramatic battlefield developments. A handful of settlements have been reclaimed in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk, and that’s it. An absence of climax has begun to lead to impending anti-climax and the sort of doomcasting that characterized the preliminaries of Russia’s full-scale invasion.

This evening, everybody is discussing this NYT article claiming from anon sources that the Ukrainian main thrust is under way in the Southeast.

Idk if it is true. However, there are a couple of interesting information coming out. Near Robotyne, a highly defended settlement, Ukrainians have managed to flank the Russians by bypassing east of it. The advance is reported to be 4 to 5km by Ukraine's 47th brigade.

But the most interesting area IMO is in Donetsk oblast near Staromayorske, where Ukraine almost controls the entire settlement.

Russian sources report that unless measures are taken very fast, Russian troops east of the Mokri Yaly river (36th army) are at risk of being flanked and find themselves stuck between the river and the Ukrainians. 

The Russians at Staromayorske under the command of the 5th army are about to retreat. The river is the intersection between the two Russian commands and Russians are not good at coordination. When the 5th army retreats Urozhaine is likely to be liberated without much fight because there will be no possibility to supply the Russians there. There are only two bridges: one links Urozhaine to Staromayorske and the second one is probably the short term target by Ukrainians flanking the Russians.

If these scenarios materializes it opens the way to Staromlynivka, where the Russian main defense line stands. If there is a breakthrough there, there is nothing significant until Mariupol...

Russians : ""Everyone on the ground sees this, but no countermeasures are taken.

Commanders lack the competence to solve this problem. Now the question is at the stage of pushing the blame on each other.""

""Heavy fighting continues in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, especially around the village of Robotyne, where Ukrainian forces have been trying to break through heavily mined Russian defensive lines, according to Ukrainian and Russian accounts.

“We came close to Robotyne. Have not yet entered the settlement itself. Fighting continues in trench positions in front of Robotyne,” Ukraine’s 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade, which is involved in the offensive, told CNN.

Ukrainian forces are also ""gradually advancing"" in the Melitopol and Berdiansk directions, Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said. Farther east, Ukraine is ""making progress"" and consolidating its positions in the area of Staromaiorske, she added.

Ukrainian forces have made only modest territorial advances in the south since the counteroffensive began at the end of May.

Russia attempted to attack Ukrainian forces in the Kupyansk and Lyman directions, but Ukraine has ""stabilized the situation,"" Maliar added, saying it was Russia's attempt to divert Kyiv's troops from the Bakhmut area. The Ukrainian military’s General Staff also said Wednesday that Russia attempted an assault in the Lyman direction, but it was foiled.

In the eastern Donetsk region, Maliar said Russians suffered ""huge losses in equipment and personnel"" in an attempt to go around the town of Avdiivka.

""They want to surround the city, but they are afraid to enter it, because they will get bogged down in urban battles with our defenders, so they have been trying to bypass Avdiivka for several months now. This morning they tried to bypass Avdiivka again, but suffered huge losses in equipment and personnel,"" she said.""",False,1690401592.0,t3_159uxa8,t3_159uxa8,,0,30,0,30,0,0,

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the campaign. Their comments dovetailed with reports from the battlefield on Wednesday, where artillery battles flared along the southern front line in the Zaporizhzhia region.

And Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry’s chief spokesman, reported a “massive” assault and fierce battles south of Orikhiv, a town that Ukraine holds about 60 miles north of the Sea of Azov. Vladimir Rogov, an official appointed by Moscow in southern Ukraine, said the assault involved Ukrainian troops who had been trained abroad and were equipped with about 100 armored vehicles, including German-made Leopards and American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

Another Russian occupation official in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said that Ukraine had made 36 attempts to shell settlements in the region since Tuesday. Russian assertions that the Ukrainian attacks had been repelled could not be immediately verified.

Ukrainian troops along the southern front said in interviews on Wednesday that they were steadily pushing Russian troops back, but their progress had been incremental with no major breakthroughs. They have been slowed by minefields, and some said the biggest obstacles were Russia’s withering artillery fire and airstrikes.

Ukrainian officials have told U.S. officials that the enlarged Ukrainian force would try to advance south through Russia’s minefields and other fortifications toward the city of Tokmak, and, if successful, on to Melitopol, near the coast.

Their goal is to sever the so-called land bridge between Russian-occupied Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, or at least advance far enough to put the strategically important peninsula within range of Ukrainian artillery. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and uses it as the base for its Black Sea fleet as well as to supply its forces in the south.

The new operation, if successful, could take one to three weeks, Ukrainian officials have told officials in Washington.

However, little has gone according to plan since the counteroffensive started early in June, and officials at the White House and Pentagon said on Wednesday they were watching the increased activity with keen interest.

“This is the big test,” said one senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

For more than seven weeks, Ukrainian troops have fought along three main fronts across several hundred miles in the country’s east and southeast, pressing to find a weak spot in the heavily dug-in Russian defenses to burst through.

American officials said on Wednesday that Ukrainian officials told them that Ukraine was now engaged in the main thrust of the counteroffensive, throwing more troops and equipment at the westernmost of the three fronts, near Zaporizhzhia.

The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss Ukraine’s war plans, cited three reasons.

First, Ukrainian forces have been making plodding but steady progress clearing a path through the dense Russian minefields and other fortifications. Second, they sensed an opportunity with the sacking of the regional Russian commander, Maj. Gen. Ivan Popov, to exploit turmoil in the local Russian leadership.

Last month, General Popov addressed his troops in a four-minute recording, accusing his superiors of inflicting a blow on his forces by removing him from his post in retaliation for voicing the truth about battlefield problems to senior leadership behind closed doors.

And third, Ukrainian artillery barrages have been steadily attacking Russian artillery, ammunition depots and command posts in areas well behind the front lines, creating a vulnerability to exploit if advancing Ukrainian forces can punch through the Russian defenses, and cause havoc in the rear.

“The Russians are stretched,” a Western official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details and intelligence assessments. “They are still experiencing problems with logistics, supply, personnel and weapons. They’re feeling the pressure.”

The sound of artillery battles could be heard in villages all along the front line in southern Ukraine on Wednesday. Ukrainian guns fired steadily from hidden positions and Russian artillery and mortars targeted former Russian positions and villages now occupied by Ukrainian soldiers.

Ukrainian troops deployed along the southern front as part of the counteroffensive say they are steadily pushing the Russian troops back, but they describe their progress as step by step, rather than breakthrough movements.

The front in Zaporizhzhia is one of three axes of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. One Ukrainian military objective is to reach the Sea of Azov, driving a wedge between Russian-occupied territories in southern and eastern Ukraine.

But Russian forces have built a layered defense of minefields, tank traps and fortified positions that stretches along the length of the front line and runs at least 20 miles deep. In the two months since their counteroffensive began, the Ukrainians have had to cross these heavily mined fields and tree lines to take dug-in Russian positions, while coming under heavy bombardment and frequent airstrikes.

The devastating artillery fire and powerful aviation bombs have hampered them the most, soldiers on the front line said.

On Wednesday morning a Ukrainian jet flew low over the front line, firing rockets at Russian positions before banking away sharply and releasing flares to deflect any antiaircraft fire.

Some of Ukraine’s newly trained brigades, many of them equipped with Western armored fighting vehicles and personnel carriers, are engaged in the fighting alongside well-established units of marines and mechanized infantry. The Ukrainian army command has said that not all the new Western-provided weapons are in use yet.

The strength of Russia’s firepower has forced the Ukrainians to adjust their tactics, but Ukrainian officials say they are still progressing and in some places have succeeded in breaching the first line of Russian defenses.

That may open the way to faster progress in coming weeks, some officials have hinted, but the army command is also focused on straightening the front line to prevent bulges that would expose the advancing units to a flanking movement.

Ukrainian forces launched a significant attack south of the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday, suggesting that a new phase of Kyiv’s southern counteroffensive might be underway.

Ukraine deployed three battalions reinforced with tanks, said Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry’s chief spokesman, but he added that the “massive” attack and a second one near Robotyne, a Russian-held frontline village around eight miles southeast of Orikhiv, had been repelled.

Mr. Konashenkov’s comments, reported by the Russian state news agency Tass, could not be independently confirmed, and Ukrainian officials did not directly comment. But the area south of Orikhiv, a town that Ukraine holds, is a key battleground in its push to expel Russian forces from the south and east of the country, and both sides have built up their forces in the area.

Ukraine’s counteroffensive — launched last month along three axes including in Zaporizhzhia — has failed to score a breakthrough, in part because of dense Russian minefields and heavy entrenchment by Moscow’s forces.

A major Ukrainian military objective is to reach the Sea of Azov, about 60 miles south of Orikhiv, in order to drive a wedge through Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine’s southeast.

Vladimir Rogov, an official appointed by Moscow in southern Ukraine, said on the Telegram app that fierce battles had begun south of Orikhiv, involving Ukrainian troops who had been trained abroad and were equipped with about 100 armored vehicles, including German-made Leopard tanks and American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

Another Russian occupation official in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said that Ukraine had made 36 attempts to shell settlements in the region since Tuesday. He said that Moscow’s forces had rebuffed Ukrainian attempts to break through Russian defenses.

The Ukrainian military’s general staff said in its daily update on Wednesday that Russian forces were engaged in defensive operations in the Zaporizhzhia region. A spokesman for the general staff, Andriy Kovalev, said that Russian forces had unsuccessfully tried to restore lost positions northeast of Robotyne. “The enemy continues to put up strong resistance, moves units and actively uses reserves,” he said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said that he had met with Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, and discussed offensive and defensive fighting on the front line. “We believe in our boys,” Mr. Zelensky said on Telegram, giving no details of military operations. “We continue to work.”",False,1690416213.0,t3_159uxa8,t3_159uxa8,,0,44,0,44,0,0,

>Lengthy post from milblogger Bulba of Thrones discussing the ""Genocide of Ru artillery""

>TLDR; Ukrainian losses pale in significance to Ru and while Bradley's etc can be replaced, Howitzers, MRLs and other Ru artillery cannot.

>The crackdown on dissenters such as Girkin, bloggers and military figures is seen as preparation for bad news in the Autumn.

>Another ""goodwill gesture"" is predicted soon.

>The map he refers to and included below is from 
@GeoConfirmed

Text of milblogger's post, from screenshots:

>The genocide of the artillery of the Russian Federation continues and is gaining momentum.

>Red icons are affected howitzers, self-propelled guns, MLRS, elements of air defense systems and counter-battery radars of the Russian Federation. Blue - Ukrainian. [This is referring to the map]

>These are targets hit since the beginning of the Ukrainian counter-offensive (May 9, 2023), but most of them have been destroyed in the last month and a half. Compare with the same picture from July 4th. At this rate, in a month, the superiority of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in destroying artillery (and other targets in the depths of the line of contact) will reach one order of magnitude (10 times).


>Western Osinters do the work. Each icon is accompanied by photo and video proofs with geolocation. In order to actually have parity on the battlefield, they must underestimate Ukrainian losses by 6-7 times (they cannot overestimate Russian ones - there are proofs for everything). I do not think that such an underestimation is possible: even if they have pro-Ukrainian sympathies, they are still first researchers of the war, and only secondarily propagandists. They don't have orders to increase the morale of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with outright lies, where Ukraine is losing a lot of equipment such as Bradleys - they write about it.

>The question is: can the general military stalemate persist with such dynamics? The Russian Federation destroys Bradleys, Leopards and MRAPs, and Ukraine destroys self-propelled guns, howitzers, MLRS and air defense.

>I don't think [the stalemate can persist]. Artillery is more important, and the Russian Federation has a weaker industry than the West. The losses of MRAPS and Bradleys will be compensated for Ukraine, but the losses of the Russian Federation in artillery will not.

>In order to continue to destroy the advancing IFVs, BMPs and tanks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Russian Federation needs defensive positions. When the Russian Federation runs out of self-propelled guns and howitzers, defensive positions will begin to be demolished with artillery. In addition, the practical range of Krasnopol is 17 km, and Excalibur is 35 km.

>Well, the leadership of the Wahhabi Confederation [ironic name for the Russian Federation used by milbloggers to avoid naming them directly] is clearly preparing difficult decisions, just like last year. In summer, political processes and setups for preparation, in autumn - make a run for it. Preparations are clearly underway. Many units of the Russian Armed Forces were beheaded, Wagner was castrated, and the accusation against Colonel Kvachkov, the searches in Listva bookstore, and the arrest of Igor ""Rallying"" Girkin are clearly for a reason. It's as if the gallows know that something epic is ahead, and take control of potential points of crystallization of discontent in advance.

>As you can see from the map, in addition to the traditionally hot Donetsk direction,
two more areas are being hacked by the ZSU: Melitopol and Mariupol. If the West does
not abandon Ukraine again, and does not cut off the GMLRS, Excaliburs and SARS
reconnoitred from satellites at a critical moment, and does not clamp down on the F-
16s, then, while maintaining such dynamics, one can expect breakthroughs in the front.
It is only incomprehensible why Ukraine shamefully leaked so much of its equipment
long before the Russian artillery was knocked out.

>Well, or you can believe that such a rate of knocking out artillery will not affect anything, and will not create any systemic effect.

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-26-23/index.html

""The United States and its allies are working with Kyiv on alternative land routes to deliver critical grain to the world after Russia pulled out of the grain deal that had permitted Ukrainian grain to travel through the Black Sea, the White House said Wednesday.

“We are working with our EU partners, we’re working with Ukraine and other European partners to see if there’s other ways to get grain to market over land. But that’s not as efficient,” John Kirby, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, told reporters at the White House Wednesday.

“The best way for this grain to get to market is through maritime lanes,” he said. “But we’re working to see what we can do.”

Some background: The US has previously warned that Russia could target civilian ships in the Black Sea and blame Ukraine after the Kremlin withdrew participation from the Black Sea grain deal earlier this month. The deal was originally brokered by Turkey and the United Nations last year to ensure the safe passage of grain from Ukrainian ports. 

Ukrainian grain is critical to global food supplies, especially for developing countries. Grain prices have risen sharply since the deal collapsed and as Moscow targets Ukrainian port infrastructure.""",False,1690401478.0,t3_159uxa8,t3_159uxa8,,0,19,0,19,0,0,

Some of you have been incredible at disseminating information from a conflict that doesn't directly impact most people who use Reddit. PCX, Lancet, I am looking at you, and PCX isn't even a poster anymore.

The amount of low quality posts I see, the 'Fuck Putin', the 'Slava Urkaine!' are so oddly unnecessary to me I assume I am the black sheep of the family and people appreciate it more than I do.

I am not affected by this war in a direct fashion. I live in a little-big town in the USA, I have no friend or relatives with Ukranian heritage, but I have empathy in realizing this is not a battle of countries, but a battle of ideology. 

The average Russian, for better or worse, believe this is a good course for their country. The average westerner, believe this is a ""net negative"" for personal beliefs and an assumption that other western countries believe the exact same as they do. That may not be the case. Why does that make them, the Russian, a bad person? 

We've been force-fed propaganda from one side or another, even if we refuse to believe it, even if our particular thoughts match that information.

I'll be honest, I am super drunk and apathetic, but I wish there was a way we  could utilize the information given and disseminate it in some sort of appropriate way, which does not seem to be the way we all operate here.

I know we've heard quite a bit about how the Russians are pulling reserves up to the contact 0th line, but I'm skeptical that they'd throw absolutely *everything*. 

Firstly because, even despite all the evidence to the contrary, I can't believe the Russians would be that brain-dead to not have operational reserves to allow them to retreat back to the first line in the case of a significant breakthrough, especially after having the entire winter to prepare for it. They *should know* what they're doing, but as I mentioned before Russian Command and Control has been lacking the entire war. 

Secondly, the only truly successful Russian operation after Ukraine's Kharkiv counter-offensive was the orderly retreat from Kherson oblast. I don't count Bakhmut since it was primarily Wagner throwing meat at the problem and not Russian MOD. (and it's debatable as a ""success"" for Wagner too). That might have been Surovikin, however, and I concede that Gerasimov and Shoigu are nowhere near as competent - so past success should not be indicative of future performance, but it's literally the only part of this war the Russian MOD has not looked like complete buffoons. 

Lastly, the people I hear repeat this (david D and company) can be somewhat hit or miss in their analysis compared to the more cautious OSINT folk like DefMon. Not sure how well your source stacks out. But I'm hoping they're on the money. 

All that out of the way, I'm cautiously optimistic in the outcome of this advance and I hope that Russia can't even follow it's own doctrine such that the whole house of cards collapses. I want to see us all sipping tea in Berdyansk sooner rather than later. 

Let the Russian Command and Control behave as in the words of the immortal soldier all those months ago:

This entire war was an attempt to quickly take a country through a combination of bribes, corruption and unpreparedness and thereby prove both the fecklessness of Europe in the face of power, laugh at the sanctions following Crimea in 2014, and undermine NATO and the power of ""the West"" across the globe... while grabbing control of the Black Sea coast, a bunch of natural resources including food, all while holding Europe hostage to the very thing they thought brought Russia to heel.

Ukraine not crumbling in weeks has basically *saved* the West - and undercut the whole ""multipolar world"" assertion.  Europe is finally listening to what the Baltic states have been screaming: Russia can neither be trusted in it's promises, nor ""managed"" through economic means, ever.  Obama's great reset was a rope-a-dope.  (Wonder if the lessons will stick this time?)

Once Russian artillery is diminished in that sector, Ukrainian artillery can start to more easily pick off infantry there. Locating more Russian troops to that sector is only going to increase the number of targets and not achieve a great deal. By putting troops in an area and attacking a sector that's not currently a focus of the Ukrainian advances, they hope to bait the Ukrainians into diverting resources to those areas to hold them. More troops trying to advance in a sector that Ukraine doesn't have as much equipment in causes more headaches than more troops sitting in an area saturated with artillery.

* That despite the doom and gloom on reddit.com and elsewhere, the Russians are not exulting in the ""slow offensive"" and understand in their bones the risk they face once their forces lose firepower, morale and cohesion 
* To achieve this, the AFU is using WW1 era ""nibbling tactics"" to great effect, fixing the enemy in place and then using fires to target their biggest threat - artillery
* And while the incredibly dense minefields of the defending RU is intimidating, by themselves they are only a geographical expression.  It is these minefields *observed and* *serviced by artillery* that is the real danger

c686adf106d8d8812ae30321f51167a9,159uxa8,jtljnhx,"The main thrust of Ukraine’s nearly two-month-old counteroffensive is now underway in the country’s southeast, two Pentagon officials said on Wednesday, with thousands of reinforcements pouring into the grinding battle, many of them trained and equipped by the West and, until now, held in reserve.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the campaign. Their comments dovetailed with reports from the battlefield on Wednesday, where artillery battles flared along the southern front line in the Zaporizhzhia region.

And Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Defense Ministry’s chief spokesman, reported a “massive” assault and fierce battles south of Orikhiv, a town that Ukraine holds about 60 miles north of the Sea of Azov. Vladimir Rogov, an official appointed by Moscow in southern Ukraine, said the assault involved Ukrainian troops who had been trained abroad and were equipped with about 100 armored vehicles, including German-made Leopards and American-made Bradley Fighting Vehicles.

Another Russian occupation official in Zaporizhzhia, Yevgeny Balitsky, said that Ukraine had made 36 attempts to shell settlements in the region since Tuesday. Russian assertions that the Ukrainian attacks had been repelled could not be immediately verified.

Ukrainian troops along the southern front said in interviews on Wednesday that they were steadily pushing Russian troops back, but their progress had been incremental with no major breakthroughs. They have been slowed by minefields, and some said the biggest obstacles were Russia’s withering artillery fire and airstrikes.

Ukrainian officials have told U.S. officials that the enlarged Ukrainian force would try to advance south through Russia’s minefields and other fortifications toward the city of Tokmak, and, if successful, on to Melitopol, near the coast.

Their goal is to sever the so-called land bridge between Russian-occupied Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula, or at least advance far enough to put the strategically important peninsula within range of Ukrainian artillery. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and uses it as the base for its Black Sea fleet as well as to supply its forces in the south.

The new operation, if successful, could take one to three weeks, Ukrainian officials have told officials in Washington.

However, little has gone according to plan since the counteroffensive started early in June, and officials at the White House and Pentagon said on Wednesday they were watching the increased activity with keen interest.

“This is the big test,” said one senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

We need more:

* Put sanctions on more individuals.
* Force companies to pull out of Russia. Before Russia confiscate them...
* Put more pressure on companies, organizations, countries who help Russia to evade sanctions.
* Confiscate Russian resources outside Russia.
* Turkey is about step up as they should. A lot of Russian assets there.

I'm not in the war room of either nation and I do understand the reasoning why Russia may try to attack in Luhansk to divert pressure from other areas. That said I think it's a plan that carries a lot of risks. Attacking is much harder than defending and Russia's best chance at victory is to stall out the war. 

Ukraine can more effectively use their less trained forces to defend against the Russian attack while also inflecting higher casualties on Russia. If the Russian attacks fail to make headway or to get Ukraine to divert significant amount of forces then Russia will have suffered a lot of needless losses which could have gone to strengthening their defensive lines. It's possible an attack in Luhansk is Russia's least bad option but given how much emphasis they've put in political victories over military ones part of me thinks this may just be an attempt to shift the narrative rather than a well thought out operational decision.",False,1690410636.0,t3_159uxa8,t1_jtl1zq9,,2,13,0,13,0,0,

Simply trying to plug the line, which has been Russia's primary strategy, will just lead to their men being slowly whittles away by artillery as it engages in a war of attrition.

ELI5:
Essentially, Teplinsky is highly competent, not corrupt, makes a long-term strategy to keep the “new territories” that he commands.  Luhansk is helmed by feuding men, most of which seem to be currently involved in a graft, and don’t care about gains, just getting bonuses for making said gains.


LONG VERSION:

Beginning last September, Teplinsky commanded a thorough entrenchment, several lines deep, stretching across the south and extensive mining.

His orders are so effective that the trenches are being called “bunkers” by the Ukrainians, and the UA artillery cannot penetrate.  **Teplinsky is THE REASON the UA counter offensive is “slower than expected.”** Bc it requires that reconnaissance teams approach every damn trench, *on foot*, over mined ground. 

As one [American fighting in Ukraine explained](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14mpqrq/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jq4s95y/),

> “Therefore, teams have to physically go up to the Russian positions in order to try to dislodge them. Run up to the Russians. But that the Russians have mined their positions well, so to even to get there is tough. We’ll see more of these probing attacks from Ukraine for a while.”

The placement of the trenches also plays in to the slow advance, as the analysts at VolyaMedia explained:


> The Ukrainians then inspect the captured stronghold, deploy defenses, wait for the [new Ukrainian] unit that will occupy it and move on.

> If the strongpoint is part of a defense network of several RF defensive positions, then Ukraine has to take them one by one, clear them [of Russians], clear them of mines, wait for [new Ukrainian unit] who will sit at these positions, and only then, move forward.

> Considering that the distances between strongholds can be up to 10 km apart, these advances by foot by Ukrainian infantry over rough terrain—with constant pauses of lying on the ground and ducking in bushes and waiting behind trees while a Russian drone flies by— takes 5-8 hours. 

[See here](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14wg7l2/rworldnews_live_thread_russian_invasion_of/jrkq2fx/) for rest of their analysis and relevant footnote.

Luhansk, however, is *not* commanded by competent officers.  First off, there’s a power struggle between the LPR detachments, the RF, and the PMCs.  They all attempt to have primacy, but in truth, the worst commanders were sent there because it was considered the easiest direction.
Second, there’s A LOT of training grounds there—all of those groups have training grounds there, actually.  But because of this, it means there’s a constant influx—no other occupied Oblast has this constant influx anymore.  Third, there’s a lot of holding facilities—all the refuseniks are sent there—and their presence creates much cynicism among the officers who exploit and abuse them and just generally act out of order.  All of this creates an environment in Luhansk where the officers are really just out for themselves.  Like the original link to yesterday’s comment explained—a fraud scheme seems to have developed where commanders in Luhansk are stealing the bonuses that members of the battalion get for making advances, and are indifferent about making gains which they can actually hold, long term. It’s as if they’re indifferent to the goals of their war, and each just try to get rich by it.

Teplinsky is not motivated by greed and is holds widespread respect.  He genuinely wants to create the conditions that would ensure (or at least favor/allow) that Russia could keep their illegally annexed territories.",1690402163.0,1690401825.0,t3_159uxa8,t1_jtk9yjs,,3,7,0,7,0,0,

Well thankfully people with that kind of attitude aren't in charge of these types of decisions.

I don't think that Putin will use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine but if you threaten to ""kinetically destroy them. (The Russian army and the Political structure)"" that is what countries have nuclear weapons to deter. There is not going to be direct conflict between NATO and Russia unless Russia does something to drastically escalate the situation on their own which Putin is very unlikely to do, he wants to pretend he's fighting NATO not actually fight them.

So no one is going to be forcibly removing Putin from power, there will be no boots on the ground in Russia, strikes against Russia or ultimatums that the Russian state replace itself or they will be attacked. It's not going to happen because it risks nuclear war and vast parts of world ending up as a smoking crater in a nightmare scenario. Everyone that thinks that we can somehow force regime change in Russia, or that any of Ukraine's partners would do so, are deluding themselves, it's not going to happen.

Nope when hopefully Ukraine forces Russia back to within its own borders there is likely to be no peace treaty because to sign one would be admitting defeat for Putin. So there will be border skirmishes, the odd exchange of artillery and small arms fire for years and years I would wager.

Putin still being in charge of Russia and a hostile border with Ukraine are both awful problems to have but the solution is not to touch off what will probably be a nuclear war by invading Russia. That's where your reasoning falls apart, the solution to these issues is not to get who knows how many millions killed and entire countries turned too glass. That is an outcome much worse than an intractable and hostile Russia on your border and a very likely outcome if you invade Russia.

The West/NATO should have done a lot of things differently after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, to not come down on Russia hard for it and continue with engagement was a huge mistake we all made, but once again the solution now is not to touch off a nuclear war and that is what will happen if Putin feels his position is threatening by an invasion of Russia.

The best way to contain Russia is to give Ukraine the tools they need to win the war and once Russia is out make sure Ukraine's army remains strong and they are backed up by clear security guarantees from partners, whether that be NATO or some separate agreement with Ukraine.

The only reasons they can even try to pin something on Joe, through Hunter, is the whole Burisima thing WAS an attempt at influence peddling.  Which failed.

Obama and the EU had decieded the top prosecutor in Ukraine was corrupt and they wanted him gone, before the Ukrainian govermnet recieved anymore Western money.  Joe was the point person in getting the guy canned.  Burisma was the company that had bought the prosecutor off and didn't want to lose their investment.

However, I think there's so much stuff out there that short of magic, any aircraft up there is going to have to be careful, stay low, or risk getting pinged by anti-air - even stuff from over the border.

I definitely agree that Ukraine’s systems are far better than Iraq’s were in the 1990s though that added sophistication does comes with the added drawback of cost for replacement radars/missiles. That cost tends to mean there’s far less sitting on a shelf somewhere to dig out (outside of AIM-9s/120s, those fuckers are everywhere lol).

Regarding the “Ukraine being the linchpin of the global security order” nonsense that is constantly being pushed -  quoting from [Harvard Professor Stephen Walt’s essay for ForeignPolicy.com](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/15/putin-right-ukraine-war/):

> Most important of all: Putin understood that Ukraine’s fate was more important to Russia than it was to the West. […]

> This fundamental asymmetry of interest and motivation is why the United States, Germany, and much of the rest of NATO have calibrated their responses so carefully, and why U.S. President Joe Biden ruled out sending U.S. troops from the get-go. He understood (correctly) that Putin might think Ukraine’s fate was worth sending several hundred thousand troops to fight and possibly die, but Americans didn’t and wouldn’t feel the same way about sending their sons and daughters to oppose them. It might be worth sending billions of dollars of aid to help Ukrainians defend their country, but that objective was not important enough for the United States to put its own troops in harm’s way or to run a significant risk of a nuclear war. 

> This situation also explains why Ukrainians— and their loudest supporters in the West— have gone to enormous lengths to link their country’s fate to lots of unrelated issues. If you listen to them, Russian control over Crimea or any portion of the Donbas would be a fatal blow to the “rules-based international order,” an invitation to China to seize Taiwan, a boon to autocrats everywhere, a catastrophic failure of democracy, and a sign that nuclear blackmail is easy and that Putin could use it to march his army all the way to the English Channel. Hard-liners in the West make arguments like this to make Ukraine’s fate appear as important to us as it is to Russia, but such scare tactics don’t stand up to even casual scrutiny. The future course of the 21st century is not going to be determined by whether Kyiv or Moscow ends up controlling the territories they are currently fighting over, but rather by which countries control key technologies, by climate change, and by political developments in many other places.

> Recognizing this asymmetry also explains why nuclear threats have only limited utility and why fears of nuclear blackmail are misplaced. As Thomas Schelling wrote many years ago, because a nuclear exchange is such a fearsome prospect, bargaining under the shadow of nuclear weapons becomes a “competition in risk taking.” Nobody wants to use even one nuclear weapon, but the side that cares more about a particular issue will be willing to run greater risks, especially if vital interests are at stake. For this reason, we cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that Russia would use a nuclear weapon if it were about to suffer a catastrophic defeat, and this realization places limits on how far we should be willing to push it. Again, not because Western leaders are weak-willed or craven, but because they are sensible and prudent.
Does this mean we are succumbing to “nuclear blackmail”? Could Putin use such threats to win additional concessions elsewhere? The answer is no, because the asymmetry of motivation favors us the further he tries to go. If Russia tried to coerce others into making concessions on issues where their vital interests were engaged, its demands would fall on deaf ears. Imagine Putin calling Biden and saying that he might launch a nuclear strike if the United States refused to cede Alaska back to Russia. Biden would laugh and tell him to call back when he was sober. A rival’s coercive nuclear threats have little or no credibility when the balance of resolve favors us, and it is worth remembering that neither the United States nor the Soviet Union ever engaged in successful nuclear blackmail during the long Cold War—even against non-nuclear states— despite the enormous arsenals at their disposal.",False,1690388823.0,t3_159uxa8,t1_jtjgifu,,6,1,0,1,0,0,
