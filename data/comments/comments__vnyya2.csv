Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 30 June 2022
 

- Ukrainian forces continue to hold their positions in the city of Lyschansk following their withdrawal from Sieverodonetsk. Russian forces continue to pursue an approach of creeping envelopment from the Popasna direction, removing the need to force a major new crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River in this sector.



- Current ground combat is likely focused around the Lyschansk oil refinery, 10km south-west of the city centre. At the operational level, Russian forces continue to make limited progress as they attempt to encircle Ukrainian defenders in northern Donetsk Oblast via advances from Izium.



- It is highly likely that Ukrainian forces' ability to continue fighting delaying battles, and then withdraw troops in good order before they are encircled, will continue to be a key factor in the outcome of the campaign.

The move replaces the NATO Response Force, which was for years the first to respond to any Russian attack or other crisis. The new model resembles the way NATO forces were organised during the Cold War. At that time, specific allied countries were assigned the defence of specific sectors of the border between Western and Eastern Germany.

Day 127 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet today, but as always they never forget their missile strikes, they didn‚Äôt launch them at 11pm this time though. This time they waited until 11:50pm, first they started firing at us either from regular artillery or MLRS, not sure which one, but the explosions were pretty close to us. Then just 10 minutes later, at 12am, they fired their missiles from Belgorod again, four of them, one of them might have been intercepted, and at least one fire started from those missiles.

And just half an hour ago, at 1:50am, in Odesa oblast, two missiles were fired at a town Serhiivka, one of them hit a 9 floor residential building, the other one hit a resort. One of the sections of the 9 floor building completely collapsed. Right now **10 people are already confirmed dead**, including a child, it‚Äôs likely that there are even more casualties, people are trapped under the rubble.

Is this the ‚Äúgesture of goodwill‚Äù they were talking about in the morning? They fled Snake Island, got very upset about it, and decided to kill even more civilians in retaliation?

Earlier today we reported that the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) had issued interim measures to ensure the death penalty sentence for two Britons held in Donestk were not carried out.  
  
Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured in Mariupol in April during the intense fight for control of the port city, before appearing in court in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).  
  
There, they were found guilty of ""mercenary activities and committing actions aimed at seizing power and overthrowing the constitutional order of the DPR"", though their families maintain they were fighting legitimately as part of the Ukrainian army.  
  
Today, the EHCR said in a statement that it had ""indicated in particular to the government of the Russian Federation, under Rule 39 (interim measures) of the Rules of Court, that they should ensure that the death penalty imposed on the applicants was not carried out"".  
  
However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said Russia had passed legislation this month to remove it from the jurisdiction of Europe's top human rights court and therefore was not bound by the order.  
  
He said: ""Russia no longer complies with the prescriptions of the EHCR, that's all there is to say.""

The Dutch prime minister has said western allies must send more weapons to Ukraine or risk seeing Ukrainian forces lose against Russia ‚Äì something that would be ""very problem-some"" for everyone.  
  
Mark Rutte also told Sky News that the NATO alliance needs to make good on a range of pledges made at a major summit in Madrid to bolster its own defences.  
  
Asked if the history books would look back at the Madrid summit as the moment when allies failed to respond to the challenge posed by authoritarian Russia, he said: ""No it is not the moment when we failed.  
  
""But whether this is a success depends on two things: whether we implement all the commitments including all the extra money being necessary‚Ä¶ and secondly it is about again the weapon deliveries into Ukraine,"" he said.  
  
""This is the short-term thing we need to do.   
  
""If we don‚Äôt do that then there is a risk that Ukraine cannot win this and that would be very problem-some for all of us.""  
  
At the summit, NATO allies agreed the biggest overhaul of their defences since the Cold War, increasing the number of troops at readiness to respond in a crisis, boosting military spending and bolstering their defences in countries that sit closest to Russia.  
  
They have also pledged to increase support for Ukraine, with individual allies promising more weapons and money.  
  
""It is crucial that every country in Europe and in NATO is now delivering the heavy weaponry they can deliver to Ukraine,"" Mr Rutte said.  
  
""I think we can still do more. This was my main point yesterday.  
  
""We cannot supply people, we cannot have a situation where NATO comes into direct confrontation with Russia so we have to help \[Ukrainian President Volodymyr\] Zelenskyy and his team to make sure weapon deliveries are at a higher speed, as massive as possible the heavy weaponry etc and really call up on all my colleagues to do what they can.""  
  
The Dutch leader also said threats from Russia could grow if NATO fails to increase its strength such as by inviting Sweden and Finland to join.  
  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would respond if NATO troops and infrastructure are moved into the two Nordic states, which were invited to become members of the trans-atlantic bloc during a summit in Madrid this week.  
  
Asked whether the move by NATO to expand had been escalatory, Mr Rutte said: ""It could escalate if NATO did not do this.

NATO is a defensive alliance. It's members are in Europe and North America.

It has been a long time stablising force in geopolitics as many European nations have a lot of old bad blood, often going back centuries.

By uniting many such nations and providing a deterrent for others, peace reigns (mostly) and economies can flourish.

It also enables small and middle powers to focus their defence expenditure and efforts on the things they need the most, while leveraging stronger allies or allies with other strengths.

The economic benefit slowly amplifies over time and the influence and peace impact other areas of the world (to varying degrees) through NATO and interwoven allies and partners (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea).

Some nations (see Russia) treat their 'friends' and neighbours with violence and threats to theirs and the worlds detriment (need I mention the stockmarket and inflation volatility we are all seeing at the moment).

So for those (few) who have negative or semi-negative thoughts about it, even in non-aligned countries, NATOs unity (and US strength) end up being a stablising force that all benefit from.

Even though some nations have engaged in expeditions abroad in the last 70 years, NATO, the US and the wider allies are still a net positive and a force for good for all. Stability is always a positive for economies long term.

And while some may not like the supply of arms to Ukraine, it will in the long run be seen in the same light, as a big flashing light of 'Don't engage in imperialist wars of aggression'.

More than a dozen women in Russia's Republic of Buryatia have recorded a video statement urging the head of the Siberian region to recall their husbands from Ukraine where they are serving with the Russian armed forces.

One of the women, Vera Partilkhayeva,¬†told RFE/RL¬†on June 28 that the women's husbands were deployed in what were officially called military drills in January. But since February, they have been taking part in what Russian officials call the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

""Since February 24, they have been taking part in the special operation. They have been exhausted both morally and physically. All of them have suffered light- and medium-level contusions,"" the women said in the video statement, adding that many of the men were sick due to their living conditions.

Partilkhayeva wrote on her social network accounts that region head Aleksei Tsydenov will be personally responsible for every death of local residents in the ongoing war in Ukraine.

According to her, the video statement was recorded by the wives of military personnel of the Fifth Tank Brigade of Tatsin. At least 30 officers and soldiers of that military unit have been confirmed killed in Ukraine.

The exact number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine in more than four months of the war remains unknown.

Ukrainian authorities claim that more than 35,000 Russian troops have been killed, while the Russian Defense Ministry last commented on the subject in March, saying that 1,351 of its personnel had died.

US basketball player Brittney Griner is due to go on trial in Russia on Friday on drug charges that could see her face up to 10 years in jail, in a case that highlights the already fraught relations between Moscow and Washington.

Griner, a star player in the U.S.-based Women‚Äôs National Basketball Association (WNBA), was detained at Moscow‚Äôs Sheremetyevo Airport on February 17, just days before Russia invaded¬†Ukraine, unleashing a broader confrontation with the West.

Russian authorities said the 31-year-old was carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, a substance illegal in the country. She was charged with smuggling a large quantity of drugs, an offence that can carry up to 10 years in jail.

US officials and a score of athletes have called for the release of Griner ‚Äì or ‚ÄúBG‚Äù as she is known in the basketball community. They say she has been wrongfully detained and should be immediately returned to her family in the United States.

According to the above podcast from the NYTimes, privately European politicians are sick of the war in Ukraine and are pushing Ukraine to give in to Russian demands. All while publicly showing support for the war.

I think the quote I remember most is roughly along the lines of ""they are unwilling to sacrifice their economy for the war"". This is exactly what Putin wants. He is hoping that the support for the war is waning and that Europe will grow tired of the war.

This is how he wins.

And there are some two faced politicians who are supporting the war publicly but behind the scenes doing otherwise. If you are in Europe please reach out to whoever represents you and let them know that Russia must leave Ukraine with no territory given up.

They want NATO to be a threat to them but they also want to be a strong threat to NATO countries. If they can't keep up with NATO posturing they look a lot weaker and their threats will carry less weight and influence. So while NATO expansion isn't going to threaten Russia with invasion, it's going to severely threaten and undermine Russian influence it gains through its own threatening stance.

Sweden and Finland as an example probably only felt safe enough to join NATO because Russia looked so weak in Ukraine. You know all of that ""you and what army"" joke people said to all Russian threats regarding it as an example. If Russia can't maintain an image of strength and being a big threat it might snowball similar problems for them in other regions of the world as obviously nobody wants to get forced into a shitty deal because of a hostile military rather than economic or diplomatic incentives.

At least that's my take on it. So yes, I think Russia obviously knows NATO wouldn't invade but at the same time I do think NATO is a huge threat to the current Russian imperialist state. As a Swede a big reason I wanted to join is both to protect the baltics but also undermine Russia's soft-power in the way they are expanding.

Fourth, Putin might personally benefit from the situation. Sweden and Finland joining NATO can be presented as another proof of NATO expanding and threatening Russia. Putin uses this perceived threat to solidify his position.

If the only way NATO could stop a Russian invasion was nuclear weapons, then NATO's defence is essentially to make a suicide pact with Russia. Ergo, Russia *could* push the boundaries of NATO to below a point where it would consider a nuclear response. Invading the Baltics, for example. NATO does not want to end the world over Lithuania, is the argument, and it gives Russia scope to try it on.

However, there are two problems for NATO: Having weapons is not the same as having them ready to go, and it is not the same as having them where they need to be. 

Germany is infamous for having much of its equipment in poor condition requiring months of maintenance to get them back to fighting state. That is why Germany and others need to increase spending somewhat to get back up to speed, although many of them are also buying new things.

The second problem is that NATO doesn't have all the weapons in the Baltic states ready to go. Estonia for example raised concern that if Russia attacked, Estonia would be basically wiped out before NATO finally counterattacked after months of getting ready. So NATO wants to increase its readiness and place forces in the Baltics to defend Estonia and not have it fall to Russian hands, at least for long. Doing so requires a bit extra spending.

A third factor is also aid to Ukraine. Many countries increase military spending so they can buy new things to replace what is being given to Ukraine.

So in short: NATO doesn't really need to increase spending. Some spending increases are the result of NATO preparedness, but much of it is just in case. A country like USA especially doesn't really need to increase spending, but military industry and their lobbyists won't pass on a good excuse.",False,1656613239.0,t3_vnyya2,t1_ieceuix,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

[Severity] x [Likelihood] = 4 x 7 = 28 (Total Risk)

Russia's military isn't half as scary as we thought it was, but the risk of future conflict - right now - seems very high. This is essentially the calculus most Western countries are performing when increasing their spending.

Additionally, it's worth noting an additional factor for European countries: they can see the instability in the USA, a core security guarantor for NATO and aligned non-member nations.

Some will say Russia has figured out how their army works and now will grind Ukraine down while others say Russia is desperate and doing everything to secure Donbas while Ukraine once they get more western arms and especially guided MLRS will start pushing back Russia. Russia failed to do any of their fancy encirclements but the death counts from their artillery is pretty severe (reports of up to 100-200 men a day dead on the Ukrainian side). But worth saying Ukraine is claiming they kill more of Russia with their artillery and repelling of Russian forces and we do see constant videos of things being hit.

Ukraine is slowly pushing down towards Kherson and it shows some promise but hard to know how good Ukraine is at attacking vs Russia at defending that place. Ukraine has said they will do a larger offensive in around August so hard to know how committed they are to the current attacks.

So both sides are inflicting a lot of damage on the other. Western support and military aid has been pretty stable but not a lot of MLRS have been delivered yet (but supposedly more is on the way). There's increased claims of Russian economy struggling but very hard to know when and if it'll have a big impact on its ""special operation"" and so far it's mostly their domestic industry that's suffering.

To me it looks like a lot of hard fighting ahead. I think Ukraine's resolve is stronger and I wonder what Russia's long term plan is. Do they really want to become North Korea 2.0 or is it a lot of talk to get some favorable negotiations at the end? Hard to see sanctions go off Russia unless they do a favorable peace deal for Ukraine so that can't really be all Russia is fighting for. Maybe they are stubborn and optimistic like the early phase of the war and they hope something major happens in the west and they give up and pressure Ukraine into a bad deal? Maybe if enough time goes they'll pull another ""we never had a problem with Finland and Sweden joining NATO"" but with Ukraine?

There was even one post that said foreign legion troops were being shot if they tried to return home. None of this is believable.

The only reliable negative stories are of foreigners without military experience being turned away and it not turning out the way they thought it would. Which seems fairly appropriate to me.

The men who are fighting in the foreign legion are true heroes, and have been in some of the hardest theatres of this war. Many are ex-elite forces. I even spotted an ex-Olympic gold medalist in shooting in one of the videos.

That said, here in the States, we went from an Army that was a shell of itself in 1975 to perhaps the best equipped, best trained force in the world barely ten years later, fully prepared (and even somewhat expecting to) face the Soviets in Western Europe almost any day. Even 1991's Desert Storm was in the more classical set-piece battle expected of the 80's, and the Coalition did well. It wasn't until Mogadishu and later, the GWoT that we learned the challenges of asymmetrical warfare for a modern army, and that was largely due to the premise that the army is always training to fight the last war, not the one we're in. 

So figure for a state with even a modicum of industrial ability, they'll produce the equipment and the troops roughly concurrently, with a slight lag on the personnel side of the equation to give the stuff they'll be using enough time to be built to train them with. In the States, it took us about ten years. For an economically depleted Russia? Your guess is as good as mine, but with Chinese support... who knows?

If the balloon goes up in Europe, I imagine we'll see more of what we're seeing in Ukraine - some initial conventional battle, followed by asymmetrical operations wherever NATO can't put a full force in play.

Ukraine did not and even now does not have 600K active duty military personnel, more like 250K. But it's a moot point because the larger numbers only makes their attempt to control all of Ukraine with such a minuscule army more idiotic. Remember that we are now in month five of what was initially suppose to be a one week war, because Putin thought Ukraine was going to fall like Crimea. Ukraine did have some fuck-ups in the South to match Russian incompetence in their attempt to capture Kyiv, but whether they were actually due to incompetence or betrayal the officer responsible is no longer there. 

>The Russians are grinding Ukraine to a pulp. Elensky himself even said they are losing 1k men a day to death or injury. 

And yet Russia is losing more, with estimates of deaths (not casualties) of from 25K to 35K. With a minimum of 3:1 injuries to deaths in war that's at least equal if not a larger casualty count. So which one is it, is Ukraine trading man for man despite there being three times as many UA targets for Russia to hit or are their militaries more equally matched in which case all those other soldiers are in reserve ready to replace the casualties taken on the front?

>Ask yourself this: if Ukraine is winning, why are they enlisting randoms off the street to fight?

Why is Russia now enlisting 60 year olds? Why are they conscripting LNR/DNR troops giving them almost no training and putting a WW2 rifle in their hands with no other equipment?

Putin is far from losing this war, he is happy to go on a path of extermination at whatever cost. The Chechen war was a prime example of his disregard for Russian deaths. 

Yes both Russia and Ukraine are taking enormous losses, their best troops are all dead and wounded. 

However, this war will be decided by which country‚Äôs economy folds first. 

Ukraine‚Äôs economy has been totally destroyed by Russia. Its grain and steel are being systematically stolen. Its gas reserves in the Donbas are now in Russian hands. 

Ukraine‚Äôs fate is now solely in the hands of the West, and who knows how long they will be able to keep Ukraine afloat whilst their domestic economies suffer from inflation. And when winter sets in and gas and oil reserves start to dwindle, there is every chance the EU will begin negotiations with Russia again in exchange for sanctions relief. 

So I believe the only way to end this war is for more ammunition and long range weapon systems to totally kick Russia out of Ukraine.

Ukraine has already pledged not to strike Russia with long range weapons, and it is in Ukraine‚Äôs interest to keep this promises lest aid cease. 

If not, time is on Russia‚Äôs side, its economy is intact, and they are still making a killing on oil and gas revenue to continue funding their war.
