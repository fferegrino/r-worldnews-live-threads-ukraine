Hundreds of Ukrainian troops have completed military training in the United Kingdom, including on the Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) the UK government is supplying to help counter Russian artillery tactics.

Ukrainian troops were filmed earlier this week loading and firing 105mm light guns during exercises in Salisbury, England – one part of a British-led programme that has been undertaken by more than 450 Ukrainian armed forces with support from New Zealand. MLRS systems were also shown in use.

“It’s a force multiplier,” Captain James Oliphant of the Royal Artillery, who was involved in the three-week MLRS training element, told reporters.

“Because it’s a tracked vehicle – their rockets systems are wheeled – it is going to give them more manoeuvrability which is going to going to aid in their survivability.”

The United Kingdom will provide another 1 billion pounds ($1.2bn) of military support to Ukraine, its government has said, as NATO branded Russia the biggest “direct threat” to Western security.

The funding will go towards boosting Ukraine’s defence capabilities, including air defence systems, uncrewed aerial vehicles, new electronic warfare equipment and thousands of pieces of equipment for Ukrainian soldiers.

“UK weapons, equipment and training are transforming Ukraine’s defences against this onslaught. And we will continue to stand squarely behind the Ukrainian people to ensure Putin fails in Ukraine,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.

The latest funding comes after the UK said in May it would provide an additional 1.3 billion pounds ($1.58bn) in military support and aid to Ukraine, and takes the UK’s total military and economic support to 3.8 billion pounds ($4.61bn) this year.

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 30 June 2022
 

- Ukrainian forces continue to hold their positions in the city of Lyschansk following their withdrawal from Sieverodonetsk. Russian forces continue to pursue an approach of creeping envelopment from the Popasna direction, removing the need to force a major new crossing of the Siverskyi Donets River in this sector.



- Current ground combat is likely focused around the Lyschansk oil refinery, 10km south-west of the city centre. At the operational level, Russian forces continue to make limited progress as they attempt to encircle Ukrainian defenders in northern Donetsk Oblast via advances from Izium.



- It is highly likely that Ukrainian forces' ability to continue fighting delaying battles, and then withdraw troops in good order before they are encircled, will continue to be a key factor in the outcome of the campaign.

NATO has agreed to put more than 300,000 troops at high readiness from 2023, up from 40,000 presently. The new military lineup is designed to better counter Russia, the country the alliance has designated as posing the greatest threat.

The move replaces the NATO Response Force, which was for years the first to respond to any Russian attack or other crisis. The new model resembles the way NATO forces were organised during the Cold War. At that time, specific allied countries were assigned the defence of specific sectors of the border between Western and Eastern Germany.

“Today, NATO leaders decided a fundamental shift in our defence and deterrence to respond to a new security reality,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters, adding NATO would enhance its “battlegroups in the eastern part of the alliance up to brigade level.”

A brigade has some 3,000 to 5,000 troops, while a battalion – the unit that made up a battlegroup in the past – normally has between 300 to 1,000 troops.

Day 127 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It was mostly quiet today, but as always they never forget their missile strikes, they didn’t launch them at 11pm this time though. This time they waited until 11:50pm, first they started firing at us either from regular artillery or MLRS, not sure which one, but the explosions were pretty close to us. Then just 10 minutes later, at 12am, they fired their missiles from Belgorod again, four of them, one of them might have been intercepted, and at least one fire started from those missiles.

And just half an hour ago, at 1:50am, in Odesa oblast, two missiles were fired at a town Serhiivka, one of them hit a 9 floor residential building, the other one hit a resort. One of the sections of the 9 floor building completely collapsed. Right now **10 people are already confirmed dead**, including a child, it’s likely that there are even more casualties, people are trapped under the rubble.

Is this the “gesture of goodwill” they were talking about in the morning? They fled Snake Island, got very upset about it, and decided to kill even more civilians in retaliation? Fucking monsters, they specifically targeted two residential buildings full of people; missiles were fired from the sea, from their planes.

It's the third and final day of the NATO summit in Madrid. 

We expect to hear about how much more aid countries will be providing to Ukraine.

Here are some of the key news conferences we are expecting today:

11.15am - NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg

11.45am - Prime Minister Boris Johnson 

1pm - US President Joe Biden 

2pm - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

We'll bring you the latest updates.

Yesterday the US said it would increase its military deployments in Europe with more troops and weapons - part of the largest overhaul of NATO defences since the cold war. 

The UK announced it was giving £1bn worth of military aid to Ukraine, including air defence systems and unmanned drones.

The government also promised to send an extra 1,000 troops to eastern Europe and to train Ukrainian soldiers.

Earlier today we reported that the European Court of Human Rights (EHCR) had issued interim measures to ensure the death penalty sentence for two Britons held in Donestk were not carried out.  
  
Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured in Mariupol in April during the intense fight for control of the port city, before appearing in court in the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).  
  
There, they were found guilty of ""mercenary activities and committing actions aimed at seizing power and overthrowing the constitutional order of the DPR"", though their families maintain they were fighting legitimately as part of the Ukrainian army.  
  
Today, the EHCR said in a statement that it had ""indicated in particular to the government of the Russian Federation, under Rule 39 (interim measures) of the Rules of Court, that they should ensure that the death penalty imposed on the applicants was not carried out"".  
  
However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said Russia had passed legislation this month to remove it from the jurisdiction of Europe's top human rights court and therefore was not bound by the order.  
  
He said: ""Russia no longer complies with the prescriptions of the EHCR, that's all there is to say.""

Because in all of the history of countries pulling dirty tricks on other countries, first it was the Crimea and Donbas bullshit while Ukraine was undergoing a governmental crisis precipitated by Putin’s punk Yanukovych bailing on his country in the middle of the night instead of facing his legal ouster from government, then with the ‘Who us?

The Dutch prime minister has said western allies must send more weapons to Ukraine or risk seeing Ukrainian forces lose against Russia – something that would be ""very problem-some"" for everyone.  
  
Mark Rutte also told Sky News that the NATO alliance needs to make good on a range of pledges made at a major summit in Madrid to bolster its own defences.  
  
Asked if the history books would look back at the Madrid summit as the moment when allies failed to respond to the challenge posed by authoritarian Russia, he said: ""No it is not the moment when we failed.  
  
""But whether this is a success depends on two things: whether we implement all the commitments including all the extra money being necessary… and secondly it is about again the weapon deliveries into Ukraine,"" he said.  
  
""This is the short-term thing we need to do.   
  
""If we don’t do that then there is a risk that Ukraine cannot win this and that would be very problem-some for all of us.""  
  
At the summit, NATO allies agreed the biggest overhaul of their defences since the Cold War, increasing the number of troops at readiness to respond in a crisis, boosting military spending and bolstering their defences in countries that sit closest to Russia.  
  
They have also pledged to increase support for Ukraine, with individual allies promising more weapons and money.  
  
""It is crucial that every country in Europe and in NATO is now delivering the heavy weaponry they can deliver to Ukraine,"" Mr Rutte said.  
  
""I think we can still do more. This was my main point yesterday.  
  
""We cannot supply people, we cannot have a situation where NATO comes into direct confrontation with Russia so we have to help \[Ukrainian President Volodymyr\] Zelenskyy and his team to make sure weapon deliveries are at a higher speed, as massive as possible the heavy weaponry etc and really call up on all my colleagues to do what they can.""  
  
The Dutch leader also said threats from Russia could grow if NATO fails to increase its strength such as by inviting Sweden and Finland to join.  
  
Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would respond if NATO troops and infrastructure are moved into the two Nordic states, which were invited to become members of the trans-atlantic bloc during a summit in Madrid this week.  
  
Asked whether the move by NATO to expand had been escalatory, Mr Rutte said: ""It could escalate if NATO did not do this.

Vladimir Putin has hit back at G7 leaders who mocked his bare-chested horseback riding photographs. 

As the leaders sat down for their first meeting of the three-day G7 summit on Sunday, the British prime minister asked if they take off their jackets, adding: ""Can we take our clothes off?""

""We all have to show that we're tougher than Putin,"" Boris Johnson joked, saying leaders should ""show them our pecs"". 

""Bare-chested horseback riding,"" suggested Canada's Justin Trudeau as leaders laughed. 

""Oh yes,"" said European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. ""Horseback riding is the best.""

Addressing the comments, the Russian president said: ""I don't know how they wanted to undress, to the waist or below the waist, but I think that it would be a disgusting sight. 

""In any case, if you remember [Russian poet Alexander] Pushkin, I can make a mistake in the words in the details, but I think he said that you may become a man of business and think of beauty of the nails.

NATO is a defensive alliance. It's members are in Europe and North America.

It has been a long time stablising force in geopolitics as many European nations have a lot of old bad blood, often going back centuries.

By uniting many such nations and providing a deterrent for others, peace reigns (mostly) and economies can flourish.

It also enables small and middle powers to focus their defence expenditure and efforts on the things they need the most, while leveraging stronger allies or allies with other strengths.

The economic benefit slowly amplifies over time and the influence and peace impact other areas of the world (to varying degrees) through NATO and interwoven allies and partners (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea).

Some nations (see Russia) treat their 'friends' and neighbours with violence and threats to theirs and the worlds detriment (need I mention the stockmarket and inflation volatility we are all seeing at the moment).

So for those (few) who have negative or semi-negative thoughts about it, even in non-aligned countries, NATOs unity (and US strength) end up being a stablising force that all benefit from.

Even though some nations have engaged in expeditions abroad in the last 70 years, NATO, the US and the wider allies are still a net positive and a force for good for all. Stability is always a positive for economies long term.

And while some may not like the supply of arms to Ukraine, it will in the long run be seen in the same light, as a big flashing light of 'Don't engage in imperialist wars of aggression'.

More than a dozen women in Russia's Republic of Buryatia have recorded a video statement urging the head of the Siberian region to recall their husbands from Ukraine where they are serving with the Russian armed forces.

One of the women, Vera Partilkhayeva, told RFE/RL on June 28 that the women's husbands were deployed in what were officially called military drills in January. But since February, they have been taking part in what Russian officials call the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

""Since February 24, they have been taking part in the special operation. They have been exhausted both morally and physically. All of them have suffered light- and medium-level contusions,"" the women said in the video statement, adding that many of the men were sick due to their living conditions.

Partilkhayeva wrote on her social network accounts that region head Aleksei Tsydenov will be personally responsible for every death of local residents in the ongoing war in Ukraine.

According to her, the video statement was recorded by the wives of military personnel of the Fifth Tank Brigade of Tatsin. At least 30 officers and soldiers of that military unit have been confirmed killed in Ukraine.

The exact number of Russian troops killed in Ukraine in more than four months of the war remains unknown.

Ukrainian authorities claim that more than 35,000 Russian troops have been killed, while the Russian Defense Ministry last commented on the subject in March, saying that 1,351 of its personnel had died.

The United States has not seen China evade sanctions or provide military equipment to Russia, a senior US official has said, adding that enforcement measures taken earlier in the week targeted certain Chinese companies, not the government, Reuters reports.

The Commerce Department added five companies in China to a trade blacklist on Tuesday for allegedly supporting Russia’s military and defence industrial base as Moscow carries out its war in Ukraine. US officials have warned of consequences, including sanctions, should China offer material support for Russia’s war effort, but have consistently said they have yet to detect overt Chinese military and economic backing of Moscow.

“China is not providing material support. This is normal course-of-business enforcement action against entities that have been backfilling for Russia,” a senior Biden administration official told Reuters, referring to the Commerce blacklist.

“We have not seen the PRC (People’s Republic of China) engage in systematic evasion or provide military equipment to Russia,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

US basketball player Brittney Griner is due to go on trial in Russia on Friday on drug charges that could see her face up to 10 years in jail, in a case that highlights the already fraught relations between Moscow and Washington.

Griner, a star player in the U.S.-based Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA), was detained at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport on February 17, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine, unleashing a broader confrontation with the West.

Russian authorities said the 31-year-old was carrying vape cartridges containing hashish oil, a substance illegal in the country. She was charged with smuggling a large quantity of drugs, an offence that can carry up to 10 years in jail.

US officials and a score of athletes have called for the release of Griner – or “BG” as she is known in the basketball community. They say she has been wrongfully detained and should be immediately returned to her family in the United States.

According to the above podcast from the NYTimes, privately European politicians are sick of the war in Ukraine and are pushing Ukraine to give in to Russian demands. All while publicly showing support for the war.

I think the quote I remember most is roughly along the lines of ""they are unwilling to sacrifice their economy for the war"". This is exactly what Putin wants. He is hoping that the support for the war is waning and that Europe will grow tired of the war.

This is how he wins.

And there are some two faced politicians who are supporting the war publicly but behind the scenes doing otherwise. If you are in Europe please reach out to whoever represents you and let them know that Russia must leave Ukraine with no territory given up. Territory was given up in 2014 and a handful of years later they invaded again. Giving up more territory is just a repeat of 2014 and we will yet again be at war sometime in the future.",False,1656643624.0,t3_vnyya2,t3_vnyya2,,0,16,0,16,0,0,

They want NATO to be a threat to them but they also want to be a strong threat to NATO countries. If they can't keep up with NATO posturing they look a lot weaker and their threats will carry less weight and influence. So while NATO expansion isn't going to threaten Russia with invasion, it's going to severely threaten and undermine Russian influence it gains through its own threatening stance.

Sweden and Finland as an example probably only felt safe enough to join NATO because Russia looked so weak in Ukraine. You know all of that ""you and what army"" joke people said to all Russian threats regarding it as an example. If Russia can't maintain an image of strength and being a big threat it might snowball similar problems for them in other regions of the world as obviously nobody wants to get forced into a shitty deal because of a hostile military rather than economic or diplomatic incentives.

At least that's my take on it. So yes, I think Russia obviously knows NATO wouldn't invade but at the same time I do think NATO is a huge threat to the current Russian imperialist state. As a Swede a big reason I wanted to join is both to protect the baltics but also undermine Russia's soft-power in the way they are expanding.

Third, Putin could not benefit from an open war against western nations, NATO members or not.

Fourth, Putin might personally benefit from the situation. Sweden and Finland joining NATO can be presented as another proof of NATO expanding and threatening Russia. Putin uses this perceived threat to solidify his position.

That being said, if Finland had chosen a different path and not joined the EU in early 90s, the situation might be different. Finland was part of the Russian Empire in the 1800s. There are some fools in Russia who think Finland is historically a part of Russia because of that relatively short period between Swedish rule and independence.",1656578808.0,1656569309.0,t3_vnyya2,t1_iea2xqx,,1,9,0,9,0,0,

It's that simple.

If the only way NATO could stop a Russian invasion was nuclear weapons, then NATO's defence is essentially to make a suicide pact with Russia. Ergo, Russia *could* push the boundaries of NATO to below a point where it would consider a nuclear response. Invading the Baltics, for example. NATO does not want to end the world over Lithuania, is the argument, and it gives Russia scope to try it on.

However, there are two problems for NATO: Having weapons is not the same as having them ready to go, and it is not the same as having them where they need to be. 

Germany is infamous for having much of its equipment in poor condition requiring months of maintenance to get them back to fighting state. That is why Germany and others need to increase spending somewhat to get back up to speed, although many of them are also buying new things.

The second problem is that NATO doesn't have all the weapons in the Baltic states ready to go. Estonia for example raised concern that if Russia attacked, Estonia would be basically wiped out before NATO finally counterattacked after months of getting ready. So NATO wants to increase its readiness and place forces in the Baltics to defend Estonia and not have it fall to Russian hands, at least for long. Doing so requires a bit extra spending.

A third factor is also aid to Ukraine. Many countries increase military spending so they can buy new things to replace what is being given to Ukraine.

So in short: NATO doesn't really need to increase spending. Some spending increases are the result of NATO preparedness, but much of it is just in case. A country like USA especially doesn't really need to increase spending, but military industry and their lobbyists won't pass on a good excuse.",False,1656613239.0,t3_vnyya2,t1_ieceuix,,1,21,0,21,0,0,

That is to say, the West all thought Russia was a near-peer threat to the US, but there was an extremely low likelihood they were going to end up in a war. In reality, the situation looks closer to:

[Severity] x [Likelihood] = 4 x 7 = 28 (Total Risk)

Russia's military isn't half as scary as we thought it was, but the risk of future conflict - right now - seems very high. This is essentially the calculus most Western countries are performing when increasing their spending.

Additionally, it's worth noting an additional factor for European countries: they can see the instability in the USA, a core security guarantor for NATO and aligned non-member nations. Right now, the USA is doing a great job on Ukraine, but their last President was impeached for trying to blackmail Ukraine over the selfsame arms.

Some will say Russia has figured out how their army works and now will grind Ukraine down while others say Russia is desperate and doing everything to secure Donbas while Ukraine once they get more western arms and especially guided MLRS will start pushing back Russia. Russia failed to do any of their fancy encirclements but the death counts from their artillery is pretty severe (reports of up to 100-200 men a day dead on the Ukrainian side). But worth saying Ukraine is claiming they kill more of Russia with their artillery and repelling of Russian forces and we do see constant videos of things being hit.

Ukraine is slowly pushing down towards Kherson and it shows some promise but hard to know how good Ukraine is at attacking vs Russia at defending that place. Ukraine has said they will do a larger offensive in around August so hard to know how committed they are to the current attacks.

So both sides are inflicting a lot of damage on the other. Western support and military aid has been pretty stable but not a lot of MLRS have been delivered yet (but supposedly more is on the way). There's increased claims of Russian economy struggling but very hard to know when and if it'll have a big impact on its ""special operation"" and so far it's mostly their domestic industry that's suffering.

To me it looks like a lot of hard fighting ahead. I think Ukraine's resolve is stronger and I wonder what Russia's long term plan is. Do they really want to become North Korea 2.0 or is it a lot of talk to get some favorable negotiations at the end? Hard to see sanctions go off Russia unless they do a favorable peace deal for Ukraine so that can't really be all Russia is fighting for. Maybe they are stubborn and optimistic like the early phase of the war and they hope something major happens in the west and they give up and pressure Ukraine into a bad deal? Maybe if enough time goes they'll pull another ""we never had a problem with Finland and Sweden joining NATO"" but with Ukraine?

To be frank, this reeks of propaganda.

It’s interesting, since the foreign legion is exactly the opposite of Russia’s hopes that the world will not stand with Ukraine, I’ve seen a HUGE proportion of Russian media trying to demonise it.

There was even one post that said foreign legion troops were being shot if they tried to return home. None of this is believable.

The only reliable negative stories are of foreigners without military experience being turned away and it not turning out the way they thought it would. Which seems fairly appropriate to me.

The men who are fighting in the foreign legion are true heroes, and have been in some of the hardest theatres of this war. Many are ex-elite forces. I even spotted an ex-Olympic gold medalist in shooting in one of the videos.

Wikipedia:

“The status of Snake Island was important for delimitation of continental shelf and exclusive economic zones between Romania and Ukraine. If Snake Island were recognized as an island, then continental shelf around it should be considered as Ukrainian water. If Snake Island were not an island, but a rock,[10] then in accordance with international law the maritime boundary between Romania and Ukraine should be drawn without taking into consideration the isle location.”

End result was a line for both Romania and UA waters. Maybe they’re afraid if they lose snake island all water goes back to Romania? Or Russia/Romania? Maybe nothing to do with that, but an idea.",False,1656583802.0,t3_vnyya2,t1_ieaf6v3,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

As far as I remember he has always said Finland joining NATO is Finland's own business, even though he considers it not beneficial to Finns themselves.

As a Finn I can't talk about Sweden, but the writing was all over the wall. Any decent intelligence service could've read it.

Finland has been preparing to join NATO for thirty years. The only obstacle has been the public opinion. 

Anyone (any politician, diplomat or spy) talking with Finnish people and leaders could have told that an open war against Ukraine would very likely cause a dramatic shift in public opinion. Heck, even I chatted about it here in Reddit before the 24th Feb. I find it hard to believe Putin wasn't well informed about this outcome.

That said, here in the States, we went from an Army that was a shell of itself in 1975 to perhaps the best equipped, best trained force in the world barely ten years later, fully prepared (and even somewhat expecting to) face the Soviets in Western Europe almost any day. Even 1991's Desert Storm was in the more classical set-piece battle expected of the 80's, and the Coalition did well. It wasn't until Mogadishu and later, the GWoT that we learned the challenges of asymmetrical warfare for a modern army, and that was largely due to the premise that the army is always training to fight the last war, not the one we're in. 

So figure for a state with even a modicum of industrial ability, they'll produce the equipment and the troops roughly concurrently, with a slight lag on the personnel side of the equation to give the stuff they'll be using enough time to be built to train them with. In the States, it took us about ten years. For an economically depleted Russia? Your guess is as good as mine, but with Chinese support... who knows?

If the balloon goes up in Europe, I imagine we'll see more of what we're seeing in Ukraine - some initial conventional battle, followed by asymmetrical operations wherever NATO can't put a full force in play.

The easiest part of that is population structure.  Sure, Russia's got a population structure issue, but it also has a population of 144M.

Quantity has a quality all of its own.

Then, as far as sanctions are concerned, these hurt now because of how Russia's entire manufacturing and military/industrial complex is reliant on western supply chains.

Running out of ammunition is a problem since their artillery uses a different diameter. I agree with that.

Ukraine did not and even now does not have 600K active duty military personnel, more like 250K. But it's a moot point because the larger numbers only makes their attempt to control all of Ukraine with such a minuscule army more idiotic. Remember that we are now in month five of what was initially suppose to be a one week war, because Putin thought Ukraine was going to fall like Crimea. Ukraine did have some fuck-ups in the South to match Russian incompetence in their attempt to capture Kyiv, but whether they were actually due to incompetence or betrayal the officer responsible is no longer there. 

>The Russians are grinding Ukraine to a pulp. Elensky himself even said they are losing 1k men a day to death or injury. 

And yet Russia is losing more, with estimates of deaths (not casualties) of from 25K to 35K. With a minimum of 3:1 injuries to deaths in war that's at least equal if not a larger casualty count. So which one is it, is Ukraine trading man for man despite there being three times as many UA targets for Russia to hit or are their militaries more equally matched in which case all those other soldiers are in reserve ready to replace the casualties taken on the front?

>Ask yourself this: if Ukraine is winning, why are they enlisting randoms off the street to fight?

Why is Russia now enlisting 60 year olds? Why are they conscripting LNR/DNR troops giving them almost no training and putting a WW2 rifle in their hands with no other equipment?

Putin is far from losing this war, he is happy to go on a path of extermination at whatever cost. The Chechen war was a prime example of his disregard for Russian deaths. 

Yes both Russia and Ukraine are taking enormous losses, their best troops are all dead and wounded. 

However, this war will be decided by which country’s economy folds first. 

Ukraine’s economy has been totally destroyed by Russia. Its grain and steel are being systematically stolen. Its gas reserves in the Donbas are now in Russian hands. 

Ukraine’s fate is now solely in the hands of the West, and who knows how long they will be able to keep Ukraine afloat whilst their domestic economies suffer from inflation. And when winter sets in and gas and oil reserves start to dwindle, there is every chance the EU will begin negotiations with Russia again in exchange for sanctions relief. 

So I believe the only way to end this war is for more ammunition and long range weapon systems to totally kick Russia out of Ukraine.

Ukraine has already pledged not to strike Russia with long range weapons, and it is in Ukraine’s interest to keep this promises lest aid cease. 

If not, time is on Russia’s side, its economy is intact, and they are still making a killing on oil and gas revenue to continue funding their war. And if Russia wins, there will be hell to pay for everyone.
