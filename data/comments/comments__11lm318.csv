Day 377-378 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last couple of days were mostly quiet, but with some air raid alerts as usual. There is even an alert active right now, and this one might actually be one of the real ones as there are reports of a possible Shahed attack soon. Apparently, there are also long-range bombers active in Russia right now, which could mean a new missile attack, though usually they don’t do them at this time of night. I guess this threat is being taken pretty seriously, as some regions preventively turned off electricity to avoid potential damage from missile strikes.

Some good news is that here in Kharkiv we are finally getting our street lights turned back on, and that’s despite all the missile strikes on our energy infrastructure. Our street lights were turned off on the first day of the war, over a year ago, and they weren’t turned back on even once since then, so lights being back is actually pretty big news. Though for now it’s only the main streets of the city that have their lights turned back on, so in my district we are still living in darkness, but that will most likely change soon. 

These recent protests in Georgia really start to remind us of our own maidan from back then, people going to the streets against the will of the pro-Russian government, and they are being suppressed by the police/special services as well. It’s great to see that people actually fight back and don’t let themselves get captured by the police. This is the only way to deal with Russian puppets, if you don’t fight back, you just lose by default and it’s great that Georgians know that, because they are in the exact same situation as us, their country was also invaded by Russia and parts of it still remain occupied. Sadly, they are a much smaller country than we are, so fighting back is that much harder for them, but they are doing it anyway, which is incredible.",False,1678322528.0,t3_11lm318,t3_11lm318,,0,81,0,81,0,0,

Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 8 March 2023  


* On 4 March 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defence released a video of a rare visit to Ukraine by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu.  

* There is a realistic possibility that this was partially in response to recent footage of the owner of Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, visiting his fighters on the front line.  

*  Wagner is in a high-profile dispute with the Russian Ministry of Defence and Shoigu is likely sensitive to being compared to Prigozhin.  

* The only deployed Russian field commander shown in the video was Colonel General Rustam Muradov. It is notable that Muradov is responsible for the Vuhledar sector of Donetsk Oblast, where several assaults have failed in the last three months.  

* Until recently, the Russian command likely saw a breakthrough at Vuhledar as a key way to achieve an operationally significant breakthrough in Ukraine’s lines.  

* Russian planners are likely facing the dilemma of attempting another Vuhledar assault or supporting intense fighting further north near Bakhmut and Kremina.

It's worth reading the full article, but if you're in a hurry here's a couple quotes [from the article in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/08/russia-ukraine-us-intelligence-chief-avril-haines):
>She claimed US-led sanctions were having an impact on Russia’s ability to build more weapons.

>“It will be increasingly challenging for them to sustain even the current level of offensive operations in the coming months and consequently, they may fully shift to holding and defending the territories they now occupy,” Haines said.  

>“In short, we do not foresee the Russian military recovering enough this year to make major territorial gains, but Putin most likely calculates the time works in his favour, and prolonging the war, including with potential pauses in the fighting, may be his best remaining pathway to eventually securing Russian strategic interests in Ukraine, even if it takes years.”  

She also thinks that China will help Russia:  
>“We do see them providing assistance to Russia in the context of the conflict,” she said, adding that it was something the US watched very carefully. “We see them in a situation in which they’ve become increasingly uncomfortable about the level of assistance and not looking to do it as publicly as might otherwise occur, given the reputational costs associated with it.”

>Despite the combative rhetoric of Xi Jinping and others in the Chinese leadership, Haines said it was the concerted assessment of US intelligence that Xi wanted to avoid further US sanctions.

>“He wants a period of relative calm to give China the time and stability it needs to address growing domestic difficulties,” Haines said.

Here's the full summary:

Ministers meeting with their Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksiy Reznikov, in Stockholm were debating a push to meet Kyiv’s immediate needs and bolster Europe’s defence industry for the longer term. “Our priority number one is air defence systems, and also ammunition, ammunition and again ammunition,” Reznikov said as he arrived for the meeting

The logic is clear: to prevent our units from deploying a potential (!) local counterattack and pressuring Siversk with its subsequent capture. The latter will make it possible to secure the western flank of the Lysichansk group of Russians from our counterattacks. That is why they attack so madly in the Rozdolivka area. So far, the enemy wasn’t successful.

> **South**: our Defense Forces are intensifying counterattacks. If successful, it will allow our garrison to breathe a little easier.  But so far the successes are minimal. After all, there are a lot of enemies in all directions.

>Where will the Russians try to advance - the opinion of a military expert

>Oleksiy Hetman said that in eastern Ukraine, Russian occupation troops will try to advance in an arc from Luhansk region to Vuhledar.

>The enemy has three groups for this purpose.

>""One is in the Kupiansk and Liman direction, there are about 120 thousand people. About 30-50 thousand people around Bakhmut. Near Uhledar in the south there are around 150 thousand troops. These are the three places where they will try to advance"".

>At the same time, Hetman noted that in this regard the weather plays in favor of the Ukrainian defenders, because in the current conditions it is impossible to move with heavy equipment.

>""Especially near Vuhledar, where the soil is slightly different than in Bakhmut or in the Luhansk region. Black earth is there, the equipment is bogged down. In the north, it is difficult to use heavy equipment, because there are forests there. It is more difficult to move BMPs and APCs, because you have to go on certain trails - not as on open field,"" the analyst explained.

From his observation it looks like the whole Russian military forces are grouped in those 3 areas. That actually confirms other reports that Russia drained absolutely everything to send men and equipment to Ukraine. The only ground units that are not in Ukraine are in Belarus and in Kaliningrad. Excluding nuclear forces (which were drained already to support the war effort) only some aviation and some AA units are not directly involved in Ukraine. That's probably why Ukraine wants to keep Bakhmut and Wuhledar and built the fortifications there. Integration JDAMs with Ukrainian planes is a game changer. Yesterday there were some SEAD missions as well, so looks like the shift there can happen.",False,1678266600.0,t3_11lm318,t3_11lm318,,0,37,0,37,0,0,

This is also likely why we had several notable Ukrainian motorized brigades take heavy losses.

TL;DR and you can response if any of these are incorrect  
\- UA is holding steady on the western area of Bakhmut, being reinforced  
\- Controlled withdrawal east part of Bakhmut from UA, RU has advanced and control eastern Bakhmut but making slow advances  
\- It is mud season. Both sides having trouble getting their vehicles across terrain.  
\- UA has only a few routes out of bakhmut, and getting harder to transport due to weather.  
\- RU has high casualty rates on Bakhmut to UA, losses high on both sides, both sides have both profesional and unprofessional soldiers fighting on the front. A lot of street fighting  
\- RU got obliterated in Vuldehar  
\- RU is reinforcing with bringing in reinforcements from Melitopol and other areas to reinforce the attack  
\- RU Wagner vs RU General forces are not on the same page due to politics although fighting in the same front  
\- UA is sending in tactical groups for counter-offensive, RU has resorted to infantry-battalions as mobilized units are getting obliterated or stuck.  


  
Speculation:  
\- UA is probably having a gradual controlled withdrawal while RU try to brute force on Bakhmut to thin their forces while RU try to advance  
\- UA is likely planning a counter-offensive while RU is concentrated on Bakhmut, while their forces are getting further exhausted

>Then, in 1987, Trump and Ivana visited Moscow and St Petersburg for the first time. Shvets said he was fed KGB talking points and flattered by KGB operatives who floated the idea that he should go into politics.

>The ex-major recalled: “For the KGB, it was a charm offensive. They had collected a lot of information on his personality so they knew who he was personally. The feeling was that he was extremely vulnerable intellectually, and psychologically, and he was prone to flattery.

>“This is what they exploited. They played the game as if they were immensely impressed by his personality and believed this is the guy who should be the president of the United States one day: it is people like him who could change the world.

Churchill, however, was outraged and denounced ""the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country.""[...] Churchill was glad Stalin had relented but thought that Stalin had been testing the waters.

In reality we should have been teaching it as it was: The USSR and first and formost the Russians in that group, **started WW2**, was a genocidal society, allied with Nazi Germany, helped Germany in secret develop the tanks and planes they used for Blitzkrieg, attempted Genocide of the whole nation of Poland, and only ended up as an ally, because Nazi Germany ran a knife in their backs, before they themselves could do the same to Nazi Germany (with absolutely no good intentions behind doing so) They VERY much would have carved up Europe in cooperation with Nazi Germany had not Hitler decided he wanted it all for himself.

The first is Ukrainian and possibly Russian eyewitnesses. It's unavoidable that some of them are in Russian-held territories. If revealed these witnesses will start falling out of windows.

The second are intelligence sources inside Russia, like actual Cold-War-style assets. It's crucial they remain undiscovered as long as possible.

And last and most important, there is intelligence-gathering tech. US likely has all sorts of sci-fi spy tech that was incidentally used to collect crucial war crime evidence. It's obvious US has something next-level. They were ready to burn it to avoid the war, but Russia was too stupid to read between the lines. US can likely hear literally any conversation they want.

Company X (likely owned/financed by Gazprom somehow) is screwed... unless they can breach the contract.

The original German plan on the Southern front was to prioritize the drive to Baku on the coast of the Caspian sea. If you take it you reduce the flow of oil to the rest of the USSR, Stalingrad included, as well as cut off the Soviets being able to easily transport troops by rail from south of the Caucuses. Even though it wouldn't cut off Stalingrad from being supplied from the north taking Baku was more important strategically than taking Stalingrad.

Then Hitler thought taking Stalingrad wouldn't be nearly as hard as it was and so wanted to take it first. Hitler, and some German generals to be fair, thought the Russian army was just about done for. Given the way they had beaten them back towards Stalingrad over the course of the summer offensive it wasn't crazy to think so but they were obviously wrong. They didn't end up taking either city of course and it led to the eventual culmination of the German offensive in Russia.

We're all lucky Germany got suckered into Stalingrad instead of driving with more force for Baku, they lost an entire army who's strength was maneuver warfare and let the Soviets grind it down to nothing in urban combat. Taking Baku might not have ended up tilting the war in Germany's favor long term but it was far more important strategically than Stalingrad but with what ifs you never know, it might have made a huge difference in the outcome of the war.

If they had focused on Baku they had the potential to get the fuel supplies they desperately needed and potentially cut off the Persian lend/lease route. It is debatable whether that would have been successful however. They had a long way to go to get there.

No they're not trolling. You just read something you don't want to believe. 

Ukraine knows what they're doing. Military experts questioning Ukraine's decision also know what they're talking about, but just don't have the same intelligence as Ukraine. 

We will see who's correct with time. It's also entirely possible Ukraine is involved in some deception right now. Think back to the narrative prior to Ukrainian offensives last year. Ukraine is telegraphing a first offensive in the South, but it comes at Kharkiv. What if Ukraine is now sending messages to the Russians through Western media hoping they will fall for it again?

Edit: On this final point I'm not saying a major counter offensive is coming soon, but mostly because of mud. I'm only saying Ukraine seems to be engaged in some information warfare and possible deception. 

Zekensky and Ukrainian soldiers have in recent days stated that if Bakhmut were to fall then Russia could just keep going West. This is highly unusual coming from the Ukrainian military, especially regular soldiers. This is a narrative that began in Russia, and my personal opinion is that Ukraine may be telling Putin what he wants to hear. Maybe they want Putin to overcommit even more and lay a trap, but it's just speculation.

Russia outspent Ukraine in defense budgeting too. I'm not saying this is equivalent to Ukraine entirely, but there's enough parallels to make one wonder. It might (and I stress might) be worth making some friends in other locations instead of keeping themselves reliant on China. 

But that's just me looking at the situation (that may not even exist aside from hypotheticals) from a different viewpoint. Russia ain't the only one with reminders of former imperial glory in its culture, so take that how you will.

In your comment higher up it seemed like you were implying Mongolia would be a danger to a country like China if they tried to invade and I'm just pointing out that it's not the case. Mongolia was dominant at the world stage in like the 14th century but isn't considered a major power or even a country that has any relevance militarily in the modern era. At best they would be able to mount some kind of insurgency after an invasion but if China decided they wanted to take over Mongolia they could do it without much issue. I think the main thing is that Mongolia doesn't have anything China wants as it only has a $15.2 billion annual GDP which is a rounding error compared to China's $17.7 TRILLION GDP. Another way to think of it, China spends on its military 20 times what Mongolia's ENTIRE GDP is.",False,1678300054.0,t3_11lm318,t1_jbfkmx9,,8,1,0,1,0,0,

A lot of trading connections and China was investing differently in the country than the French. The French just exploit the uranium and resources and leave behind damaged roads and empty promises. They tried to build a railroad but it stops after 50 km and after a year the tracks were in disrepair. The Chinese got oil concessions but they also built an oil refinery coowned with the government, the first in the country. The refinery outputs much needed electricity and also produces much needed cooking gas and much needed gas for driving. The latter can be exported. So they see that the Chinese are leaving useful things behind while the French are only taking.

Again, hypotheticals, but one has to wonder if Mongolia might be a beehive that you don't want to poke.

A lot of China's minorities have been subjected to Sinofication and China does keep trying to exert its old imperial pressure towards neighboring countries. Which many do seem to find insulting even if they bite their tongues about it because they want those bytes of data that are modern economics. But will they bite their tongues if China just goes through and grabs a big chunk of the steppe to get up next to Russia because they think they can? Just to be in a position to grab something that they want more?
