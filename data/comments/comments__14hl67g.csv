1.  *In the early hours of 24 June 2023, the feud between Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner Group and the Russian MoD escalated into outright military confrontation*
2. *In an operation characterised by Prigozhin as a ‘march for freedom’, Wagner Group forces crossed from occupied Ukraine into Russia in at least two locations.*
3. *In Rostov-on-Don, Wagner has almost certainly occupied key security sites, including the HQ which runs Russia’s military operations in Ukraine.*
4. *Further Wagner units are moving north through Vorenezh Oblast, almost certainly aiming to get to Moscow. With very limited evidence of fighting between Wagner and Russian security forces, some have likely remained passive, acquiescing to Wagner.*
5. *Over the coming hours, the loyalty of Russia’s security forces, and especially the Russian National Guard, will be key to how the crisis plays out. This represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times.*

Yevgeny Prigozhin is the head of Wagner Private Military Corporation (PMC), an operationally independent “military contractor” that essentially operates as a mercenary army for Putin. Notably, though they receive funding and arms from the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD), it operates as its own separate organization and are not commanded by the heads of the MOD (for simplicity, we’ll list the big three — Shoigu, Surovikin, and Gerasimov).

For months, Prigozhin has been publicly feuding with the MOD, saying that they’ve been under supplying Wagner PMC in an effort to undermine him/distract from their own losses in Ukraine. In the last few weeks, his critiques of the state and the MOD in particular have escalated, as have the apparent actions by MOD against Wagner — for example, they recently allegedly mined an escape route that Wagner forces were going to use to escape a Ukrainian push. Whether that’s true or, if it is, whether it’s due to incompetence or malice is unclear.

Approximately 8 hours ago, Prigozhin announced that his forces were openly attacked by MOD forces in an air assault and that he’d had enough. (Interestingly, it was revealed in the last few hours that for the last 24 hours, Wagner troops had been calling loved ones to say goodbye — query what that means for whether this was imminently provoked or planned out in detail.) At any rate, approximately 6 hours ago, Wagner forces entered Rostov Oblast in Russia and proceeded to capture the city of Rostov-on-Don along with its Southern Military District HQ, which is responsible for much of the Russian war effort in Ukraine. He then announced that he demanded to meet with Shoigu and Gerasimov in Rostov-on-Don and until they came, his troops would move north to Moscow. Recent reports suggest they’ve been attacked by Russian MOD helicopters and have allegedly shot several down (with apparent video evidence circulating). Most recent reports are that Russian MOD may be evacuating troops from Voronezh and Lipitsk (about halfway to Moscow) and that advance troops of Wagner *may* have reached the outskirts of Voronezh.",False,1687587319.0,t3_14hl67g,t3_14hl67g,,0,331,0,331,0,0,

When we were told we are fighting with Ukraine, we went and fought. But it turned out that the ammo, weapons, all money put towards this were also being stolen, while officials are sitting and saving them for themselves for an incident that happened today, when someone is going towards Moscow.""

Now they are not saving anything, they are striking us with planes and helicopters at the columns with civilians. And they hit civilians because they’re missing. And they hit anywhere they can.

* Wagner PMC forces have crossed the border from Ukraine and have secured Rostov on Don and appear to currently be working on Voronezh, and do genuinely seem to be marching towards Moscow.  In incredibly loose terms, they're about halfway there, as of 5:45 ET.  

* There has been limited fighting, including several aircraft being shot down, but the majority of territory taken by Wagner has been voluntarily ceded by local authorities and regular Russian troops.  Wagner tracked vehicles are not fighting through towns, but have remained on wheeled transports for quick transportation towards Moscow.

* Moscow, Voronezh, and Rostov authorities have declared shelter in place orders, cancelled public events (including the citywide Youth Day celebrations planned for today), and declared a ""Counter Terrorist Operation"" to be in effect. Tracked and wheeled military vehicles have been spotted near the Russian state Duma (parliament) and the Kremlin, as well as transportation and other government facilities.

1. Wagner forces are reported as far east as Volgograd, as far south as the Georgian border, and as far north as 300km from Moscow. Rostov on don (spelling?), military headquarters of Ukraine invasion, was captured almost 12 hours ago at this point. Rostov airport was also seized and is apparently operating normally.
2. Russian military forces are isolated logistically from Russia at this point in time due to this as well as StormShadow missile strikes on key logistical bridges in Crimea on 6/22.
3. Occasional air attacks/helicopter attacks have been reported, but nothing of strength.
4. All rhetoric allowing a walkback is gone. Wagner has called this a civil war, declared the need for a new president. Initially communication indicated the target was the Russian Minister of Defense and associated leadership.
5. Key government personnel such as the Moscow Mayor are apparently not present/missing. EDIT: Moscow Mitch is apparently fine (see below).
6. Light defenses/police barricades are being set up in Moscow.
7. Reports of light infantry engagements, but much more defections/surrenders (likely due to small numbers of troops in each encounter).
8. Pentagon McDonald's is operating at peak hours at 4am. President Biden has been briefed on the ongoing situation.
9. Nothing of unique note from the Ukrainian side, but there may be regular combat today. Assumptions that frontline Russian troops aren't aware of what is happening.
10. Putin's initial response was delayed by other 12 hours, and he was late to a speech. Things have been quiet within the government.EDIT adding more for the upvoters, will continue to do so periodically:
11. An-26~~/Su-25~~ confirmed shot down, verifying anti-air capabilities (eastern push by Wagner).
12. Google news is reported down for Russia/parts of Russia.
13. Some movement in Chechnya, uncertain whether it will take part somehow; referred to as a 'stab in the back'.
14. Reports of more airfields being approached for capture/potential capture.
15. Wagner is apparently awaiting troop reinforcements from Eastern Ukraine.
16. Someone reported 'supplements' being distributed in the Presidential bunker, but sources are unconfirmed.
17. ""Attempts to counter Prigozhin are only going through the FSB and the National Guard. The Ministry of Defence has simply withdrawn, junior officers either refuse to follow orders or directly support Wagner""

Let’s keep in mind that we are fully in that “fog of war” phase right now, too, so it’s hard to get a read on what’s actually happening. My take is as follows:

1. Prigozhin and Wagner are done fighting in Ukraine. They have left and I just can’t imagine them suddenly getting support from MoD (Putin) and then going back to the frontline.

2. This essentially leaves the entire southern front vulnerable. I don’t see how Russia can hold Crimea much longer. Ukraine has to be making advances now or at least planning to move soon. 

3. Wagner seems to be moving north to Moscow. The biggest question now is who is helping them? I have to imagine they have supporters in the Russian military that we don’t know about or other groups that have aligned with them.

4. What do you do if you’re Putin? Withdraw a huge chunk of forces from Ukraine to go back to defend Moscow? If Wagner can move quickly enough there is a chance they may be able to move on Moscow while it’s vulnerable. 

Next few days will be very telling. Some are saying this is all “staged as an out for Putin” but I just don’t buy that. None of this is good for Putin. It makes him appear weak and out of control.

""Friends, the night turned out to be difficult and the flights did not give time to voice here my position on this vile betrayal!

Everything that is happening is a KNIFE IN THE BACK and a real military coup!

I have repeatedly warned that war is not the time to voice personal grievances and resolve disputes in our rears. The rears must always be calm and reliable. Imagine how the guys in the trenches feel now, who are facing the enemy, and behind their backs are treacherous villains. We are talking about stability, about the cohesion of the state, about the security of citizens.

History shows that such actions can lead to bloody consequences. Have we not got enough losses in the SMO? Do we need to create more problems inside the country?

We have a Supreme Commander-in-Chief, elected by the people, who knows the whole situation to the smallest detail better than any strategist, and even more so a businessman, calls the commanders ""on the ground"" personally and fully controls the course of the SMO. And the decisions of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief are taken in a balanced and scrupulous manner. Each of us sees only one part of the map, and he sees everything at once! And Vladimir Vladimirovich quite rightly noted in his address to the nation - this is a military rebellion! There is no excuse for such actions!
I fully support every word of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!

I appeal to the fighters - patriots of our Motherland. Do not fall for provocations. Whatever goals you are given, no matter what promises you are told - the security of the state and the cohesion of Russian society at such a moment is above all else! See how our enemies in the West are taking advantage of this situation. How many throw-ins, how many lies, how many false appeals that frighten our citizens, create the danger of a destabilising situation. And these are the expected consequences of Prigozhin's treacherous march.

What is happening is not an ultimatum to the Ministry of Defense. This is a challenge to the state, and against this challenge it is necessary to rally around the national leader: the military, security forces, governors, and the civilian population.

The fighters of the Ministry of Defense and the Russian Guard in the Chechen Republic have already left for the zones of conflict. We will do everything to preserve the unity of Russia and protect its statehood!

The rebellion must be crushed, and if this requires harsh measures, then we are ready!""

""Regarding the betrayal of the Motherland, the President is deeply mistaken. We’re patriots of our Motherland. We fought and we are fighting, all fighters of PMC Wagner. And no one is going to surrender to the demands of the President, FSB, or anyone else. Because we don’t want the country to live further in corruption lies, and bureaucracy.

When we fought in Africa, we were told that we needed Africa, and then they dumped it, because they stole all the money that was meant to come for help.

When we were told we are fighting with Ukraine, we went and fought. But it turned out that the ammo, weapons, all money put towards this were also being stolen, while officials are sitting and saving them for themselves for an incident that happened today, when someone is going towards Moscow.""

Now they are not saving anything, they are striking us with planes and helicopters at the columns with civilians. And they hit civilians because they’re missing. And they hit anywhere they can.

Thus, we are the patriots, but those resisting us today are those who gathered around scumbags.

Rostov appears to me as one of the key points in Russia's supply route. There is even a train route that goes to Donetsk through there. The route is also far from Ukraine, which makes it difficult for Ukraine to intercept them.

And as Wagner pushes north they'll cut off more and more Russian supply lines towards Ukraine.

This means more supplies have to take longer routes and go closer to the front in order to reach their target. Causing Russia to need more to supply the same amount and have more of them to be taken out, causing their truck shortage to grow even worse.

And this is all without Ukraine doing anything. Imagine if the Crimea bridge were to be taken out now.

On the 485th day of Putin's 3-day special military operation,  the Russian army lost 25k troops in a single day,  the Russian population was exposed to the reality of the Ukraine war disaster, a now 25k strong private military contractor started ZERGING MOSCOW while the entire Russian military remains  stuck in Ukraine. Reports are showing some Russian troops refusing to fight, and even support, the PMC.

The war may be in the end game.

Russia will need to pull even more troops from Ukraine to stop Wagner from staging a coup. If they successfully stop Wagner, this may be at the cost of giving up Ukraine. If Wagner is successful, another war criminal may gain access to an entire nuclear arsenal.

* shortest possible land border with Russia, but still leaves lots of border for Russia to have to defend from Ukraine
* cuts Russia from direct access to the Caspian sea and Iran (incredibly important)
* cuts Russia from direct access to the Black sea
* grabs massive amounts of military resources, equipment, etc
* Includes some of the most important air bases from Russia in the south
* You can become the enemy of my enemy with Ukraine to build political ties despite how much they hate each other
* You can can Georgia the land stolen by Russia to build political good will and support
* Offer Chechnya and maybe some other region freedom for support and build good will with the West
* Siphon all Russian military/resources that are against the Russian MOD
* Cut Russia from the South and hamstring them to such an extent that long term they would be even more fucked, because they would lose a warm port
* You can set yourself up as a transport hub
* You can take ownership of all the Navy in the Black sea.

Soldiers will be left with two options. Support the coup and then get to go home and live in peace. Or oppose the coup and fight a veteran armed group and continue the war.

By promising peace it means each soldier has a greater chance of being killed by opposing a coup and continuing the war, then they would by joining it and ending the war.

Promising peace was the single biggest reason the Communists were able to attract the support of soldiers in 1917, that lead to them wining the Russian Revolution.

2. Are Ukrainians best off giving the front line a break so that those stationed troops could potentially return to defend Russia? Or should they keep them under pressure to ensure that they will remain in Ukraine?!

Yesterday, just after his troops were bombed, he made a statement saying that they had offered to lay down their arms (or something to that effect.) Which indicates the Russian MoD, specifically Shoigu in Rostov, was negotiating for their surrender. Then the bombing happened.

So, Prigs is going ballistic because, according to him, they were ready to capitulate and once they signaled that to Shoigu, Shoigu bombed them. That's why he headed to Rostov, because that's where Shoigu was when the bombing happened and where the orders were executed from.

You need to extricate thousands of troops, march them through territory that suddenly became unfriendly to you, keep them fed, watered, paid, and happy, try to dodge any lingering bands of Wagners, and race Wagner to Moscow in order to preserve your regime, with Wagner having a massive headstart.

(500 KM from Voronezh to Moscow, however long that takes is your deadline)
.
.
.

Assuming all of this is done successfully, you then need to get a large number of tired and pissed off soldiers into defensive positions, which means identifying where the line is going to be held in the first place, and you are on the clock for all of this.

.
.
.
.

You're dealing with variable after variable, and trying to get the stars to align, so an army that was previously being torn to bits in the Donbass, can be rushed into defenses around Moscow, while breaking multiple speed records along the way.

And this also self sabotages the invasion of Ukraine, which is also going to generate a backlash once the military realise that you are weak and their people died for nothing, but that is the least of your concerns right now.

(You can't worry about the aftermath of losing in Ukraine, while trying not to die right now.)

I expect they have their main forces on highest level of readiness though, because very soon it might be a good time to go.

Give it 12-24 hours and see if either a partial recall happens or some of the troops from Russia decide they should be fighting on one side or the other *in* Russia; they just might not all agree about which side to fight *on* once they get there, and internal fights could well break out near the front.

Most seem to say that he has around 20-40k troops. As I understood, after the prison recruitment, Wagner reached about 50-60k at its peak, but almost certainly lost a good chunk of that number during the battle for Bahmut. We should also keep in mind that, of this number, only a thousand or so troops are the well-trained ""elite"" Wagner guys. As for equipment, I don't think anyone knows exactly what they've got. 

As for Russia, ostensibly they *should* still have a sizeable military force inside its borders, although these would be in large part conscripts and reservists, and again, there's no knowing what numbers are just on paper or in reality. We've already seen that Russia struggled to respond to several hundred fighters of the Freedom Legion, so it may be that Prigozhin believes he can punch through with ten thousand or so. 

As for money, this is my main interest.

That's why Reddit eventually shutting r/TheDonald down was such a power move at the time, and it raised the site's profile compared to other social media that let the shenanigans go on.

Element of surprise is gone and Wagner would be fighting against a city that's at least minimally fortified, and they would have to either defend long supply lines or simply go without resupply.  If they didn't take it quickly, some portion of the Russian army, diverted from Ukraine, would surround and destroy them.

I think Wagner will claim as much territory as they can realistically hold with the troops they have, and try to form some kind of breakaway region.  Maybe force Putin to make a deal that he'll let Wagner be, and in exchange Wagner will allow Russian supplies to pass through their territory on their way to the Ukraine front.  Meanwhile Wagner will try to gain new recruits and grow their power and influence.  If they're successful, maybe they'll start pushing in the direction of Moscow as they grow stronger and Putin's forces get weaker.

Prigozhin does have Putin in a rather terrible position -- he can't really respond to Wagner's insurrection without dooming his war effort in Ukraine, and regardless logistics are going to be totally screwed up as if they weren't already.  Russian forces everywhere are going to be wondering which side they should be on, and which side all their companions are on, and whether they're going to be accused of being a traitor against one side or the other if they pick wrong.

If anyone thinks he's going to hold up the Russian military from continuing it's operations in Ukraine you are greatly mistaken. 

Even if he wants to end the war in Ukraine he's not going to do that by holding up supplies or stopping airfields from conducting combat operations in Ukraine until he controls the government and military, as holding up supplies and stuff from getting to the front lines will just mean more Russians being killed. And one of his statements was about how disappointing it is all these young Russian soldiers are being killed.

Hard to know his angle or if what he is saying is true, but if you believe he wants the war to end and hes pissed about how many Russians are being killed, holding up supplies ammo stopping airfields from running combat operations in Ukraine would only lead to more Russian deaths until he's in the position to have the Russian military work with him, or control it himself and be able to negotiate with Ukraine to stop hostilities, he's not going to stop supplies and ammo from reaching the front lines even if Wagner skims some of it.

But Wagner was sending Russian inmates into the Bakhmut meat grinder without a second thought so who the fuck knows.

He then stated he's taking 25k of his men and marching on Moscow to deal with the MOD. (Note: He specifically has not mention Vladomir Putin)

Following this, in the last few hours, footage (and reports) has been appearing online showing military forces on the streets of a number of cities in southern parts of Russia. Along with video of the Prognozian meeting with members of MOD at military installations he's claimed to have captured. Additionally there are reports of soldiers more or less stepping aside and taking no action to stop Wagner forces. There seems to be a caravan of troops moving up the M4 en route to Moscow (which is still hours away via the highway system)

It effectively seems that Prigozhin is staging a coup against Putin's government. Though it is worth noting he has yet to say anything against Putin directly.  A few minutes ago Vladimir Putin gave a (seemingly recorded) speech calling out ""traitors"". Making statements about how the military and police will deal with them. Rallying the people to fight ""treason"". Which would seem to indicate he's denouncing Prigozhin's actions. (Though he also hasn't mentioned Prigozhin or Wagner by name).

Effectively it seems this may either be a coup and/or potentially that start of a civil war.",1687593122.0,1687592380.0,t3_14hl67g,t1_jpbnf16,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

Indeed, Osama bin Laden's primary role was as the financier and figurehead - he came from one of the wealthiest families in the Middle East, and his money was the reason the others kept him around, especially at first. Ayman al-Zawahiri was the brains behind the organization, and the core of the group was always Egyptian, but they relied on bin Laden for funding. Saudi Arabia, while not directly funding al-Qaeda, did passively support them by looking the other way when it came to their activities.",False,1687596695.0,t3_14hl67g,t1_jpbt7nv,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

>May 24, 2018
>
>WASHINGTON — The artillery barrage was so intense that the American commandos dived into foxholes for protection, emerging covered in flying dirt and debris to fire back at a column of tanks advancing under the heavy shelling. It was the opening salvo in a nearly four-hour assault in February by around 500 pro-Syrian government forces — including Russian mercenaries — that threatened to inflame already-simmering tensions between Washington and Moscow.
>
>In the end, 200 to 300 of the attacking fighters were killed. The others retreated under merciless airstrikes from the United States, returning later to retrieve their battlefield dead. None of the Americans at the small outpost in eastern Syria — about 40 by the end of the firefight — were harmed.
>
>The details of the Feb. 7 firefight were gleaned from interviews and documents newly obtained by The New York Times. They provide the Pentagon’s first public on-the-ground accounting of one of the single bloodiest battles the American military has faced in Syria since deploying to fight the Islamic State.
>
>The firefight was described by the Pentagon as an act of self-defense against a unit of pro-Syrian government forces. In interviews, United States military officials said they had watched — with dread — hundreds of approaching rival troops, vehicles and artillery pieces in the week leading up to the attack.
>
>The prospect of Russian military forces and American troops colliding has long been feared as the Cold War adversaries take opposing sides in Syria’s seven-year civil war.
>
>At worst, officials and experts have said, it could plunge both countries into bloody conflict. And at a minimum, squaring off in crowded battlefields has added to heightened tensions between Russia and the United States as they each seek to exert influence in the Middle East.
>
>Commanders of the rival militaries had long steered clear of the other by speaking through often-used deconfliction telephone lines. In the days leading up to the attack, and on opposite sides of the Euphrates River, Russia and the United States were backing separate offensives against the Islamic State in Syria’s oil-rich Deir al-Zour Province, which borders Iraq.
>
>American military officials repeatedly warned about the growing mass of troops. But Russian military officials said they had no control over the fighters assembling near the river — even though American surveillance equipment monitoring radio transmissions had revealed the ground force was speaking in Russian.
