French President Emmanuel Macron said it’s “his wish” to see a total block on Russian exports of coal and oil to the European Union “this week,"" following the discovery of what he described as “war crimes” in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.

Speaking Monday on French broadcaster France Inter, Macron said there are “very clear signs” war crimes have been committed in Bucha and, “it’s pretty established that it’s the Russian army” who are responsible for them.

“We can’t let it slide. We must have sanctions that dissuade with what’s happened there (in Bucha), what’s happening at Mariupol,” he said.

Macron said that he would have discussions with his European partners this week regarding further sanctions.

“Those who are behind these crimes must answer for them,” he said.
“We must send the signal very clear that it’s our collective dignity and it’s our values that we defend,” he added. “There’s no peace without justice.""

Day 40 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today as always Russians are continuing shelling our city, at this point Saltivka looks like a small Mariupol only difference is that there was no active combat in that area at all since February 28th. Recent reports of incoming attack on Kharkiv by Russians don’t sound reassuring either.

That article Russian RIA Novosti (official government news agency) posted yesterday called “What Russia should do with Ukraine” is just perfection. There’s so much fascism in it that Hitler would be proud, it’s a must read, there’s a link to it in the live feed in this thread. It’s so insane that I couldn’t hold back from laughing all the way through while reading it, but the fact that someone so deranged exists is really concerning.

In that article they literally call every Ukrainian citizen supporting “Kyiv regime” a passive Nazi and everyone who opposes Russians an active Nazi. They are saying that every Nazi (Ukrainian citizen) will be executed or put into prison and that Ukraine can’t even retain its name after their “denazification” but instead there will be “Small Russia” and “New Russia”. Also saying that executions will continue for 25 years until there’s no more Ukraine.

These fucks said that Ukraine is an anti-Russian construct created to destroy Russia and that it can’t exist as a sovereign country. They unironically say that “Ukrainian Nazism” is more dangerous than Nazi Germany and that Russia has to end it before it destroys the world by doing “de-Ukrainianisation” and “de-Europeanisation” of Ukraine.

Do they really not hear themselves? They literally say that they will arrange the genocide of all Ukrainians in order to save the world from ""Nazism"" They are also saying how the “west” is not grateful enough to Russia for saving them from capitalism, which is especially funny hearing from Russia.

There is so much fascist nonsense in that article that it's just crazy, what I wrote here is just the tip of the iceberg. Russia is so far gone holy shit. They were spreading their lies so much that they actually started to believe in them themselves, now they truly think that they are the saviors of humanity.

Update 23:47 PM. Loud explosions are happening nearby, apparently 3 jets were sighted flying to Kharkiv from Belarus around 23:00 PM and judging by the reports right now our AA defense is doing some work.

From CNN's Jeremy Herb

A bipartisan group of more than three dozen lawmakers is pushing the Biden administration to expand the weapons being provided to Ukraine’s military amid continued demands from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to help his country with more weapons to defend itself against Russia, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

Democratic Reps. Andy Kim of New Jersey and Jason Crow of Colorado and GOP Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan spearheaded the letter sent to President Joe Biden on Monday urging the US to provide more weapons, including long-range surface-to-air missiles, fighter aircraft and anti-ship missiles. The lawmakers say their request is based off a wish list Ukrainian officials provided Capitol Hill last week obtained by CNN laying out 17 areas where Ukraine is seeking additional assistance.

The lawmakers’ request also includes increasing the supply of Stinger anti-air and Javelin-anti-tank missiles that Ukraine is running low on, as well as drones that have a greater range so Ukraine can “better disrupt Russian supply lines and counter Russian siege tactics, especially in Eastern Ukraine.” 

“We recognize that the United States and its allies and partners have already provided substantial military aid, in response to the Russian invasion, including a portion of the $13.6 billion in emergency funds through the fiscal 2022 Omnibus Appropriations bill,” the lawmakers wrote. “However, Ukrainians are clear that more needs to be done for Ukraine to win this war.",False,1649102914.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

“The images from Bucha so powerfully reinforce now is not the time for complacency. The Ukrainians are defending their homeland courageously, and the United States will continue to back them with military assistance, humanitarian aid and economic support,” Sullivan told reporters at the White House.

The Biden administration, he added, is “working around the clock” to fulfill security assistance requests from Ukraine, detailing US and allied response so far and hinting at forthcoming “additional military assistance in the coming days.” 

“We expect additional new capabilities to be delivered in the near future. We can't always advertise what is being delivered out of deference to our allies and partners or for operational sensitivities, but we are moving with speed and efficiency to deliver,” he said.

The US has committed $1.65 billion in weapons and ammunition to Ukraine since Russia invaded and a total of $2.3 billion since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, according to Sullivan. He cited US-produced air defense systems and anti-tank systems, as well as laser-guided rocket systems, Puma unmanned aerial systems, and armored multipurpose vehicles among the supplies provided to Ukraine from the US and other allies.

As he concluded his remarks, Sullivan emphasized three constants over course of the war: “First, Russia will continue to use its military to try to conquer and occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory. Second, the Ukrainian military and people will continue to effectively and bravely defend their homeland. And third, the United States will stand by them for as long as it takes.”",False,1649106473.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,31,0,31,0,0,

He looked exhausted, his face waxy and pale. He said he had been put through what he called a mock execution 15 times while being questioned about local Ukrainian territorial defense forces and ammunition stored in the area.

His interrogators fired an assault rifle over his head during the questioning, he said. His eyes were bound with sticky tape but he heard and felt the gunshot above his head. “It was psychological pressure,” he said. “They were trying to kick out of me information that I was not sharing.”

Two other men also described being detained by Russian troops and told of soldiers beating them with rifle butts, and punching and kicking them. One described being tied up with his arms suspended. Another, Oleksiy Bryzgalin, 38, a construction worker, said he was strapped to a chair with a grenade between his legs for 30 hours and also had a gun fired beside the side of his head during interrogation.

The detainees were moved around and held in barns and cellars and fed only two potatoes a day, with only one toilet break daily, Mr. Bryzgalin said.

We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight and we have to get all the details so this can be an actual — have a war crime trial.

Russians only chance to succeed is brutal frontal assault using the only thing they have upper hand  in - firepower. It's also the only way they can keep up with logistics.

From CNN's Ellie Kaufman

Shipments from the $800 million security assistance package for Ukraine from the US arrived “over the course of the weekend,” Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said during a briefing on Monday. One package is arriving “in the next 24 hours,” Kirby added.

“We’re prioritizing the kinds of capabilities in those shipments that we know Ukrainians need the most: Javelins, stingers, UAVs, so all of that is being prioritized,” Kirby said.

The Department of Defense announced another $300 million package of “additional assistance activities under authority provided by the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI),” on Friday, according to a DoD release.

Kirby said the $300 million package, which will have to be bought from contractors and is not coming from US stockpiles, is just “another tool in the toolbox” to help Ukraine.

Russia's aging population, fleeing youth/skilled labor and global move away from petroleum energy sources again means Russia is fucked.

Militarily, Russia has already culminated. Ukraine has an enormous influx of Ukrainian volunteers returning to their country. These are strongly motivated, and there will be no shortage of manpower to fight, provide logistics and maintain systems. Russia is scraping the bottom of the barrel for every single thing.

>We were particularly interested in how the word “war,” prohibited in Russia from March 4, was talked about on VK. It was used a great deal — much more than the official term, “special operation,” used by the Russian government. This suggests that people do understand that the “operation” is in fact, a war. There were anti-war, pro-war, and neutral narratives describing the war.

>[...]

> Among the anti-war narratives, we saw many references to Nazi Germany. Russia was equated with Germany in the year it occupied and annexed Czechoslovakia. Others use citations from the book “Night in Lisbon” by Erich Maria Remarque to describe Russia. People stated that Ukrainians are a “fraternal” people, that this war is “forced” upon Russia by Putin, and that it causes misery and harms the civilian population, including women and children. There were narratives about the war “again in someone else’s interests,” not Russia’s. We also observed calls to use “your own judgment” and not to “blindly believe everything you are told.” A lot of people were concerned about “young children” (soldiers) that are being sent to the war without warning or consent. Others suggested that “the dictator” (Putin) will soon be “finished.”

>[...]

> Pro-war narratives claimed that the war was also “forced” on Russia but by either external forces, such as the USA or Zionists, or by Ukrainian “nationalists.” For example: “First they invaded Russia.” A lot of conspiracy theories are included, both about the “evil West,” as well as “evil oligarchs” who are bad for Russia. They suggest the war was initiated by Putin to stop “them” from harming Russia.  

> [...]

>We noticed unusual activity around the name Putin, including identical comments under identical news items on the “operation,” which suggests the possibility of coordinated activity. We also found many negative narratives about the Russian president.

> # We can conclude after studying narratives around keywords and symbols in VK’s discussions on the Russian war with Ukraine, that — at least on this platform, in these groups — there is no unified support for the war. VK users, usually considered more conservative, patriotic, and likely to follow Putin's lead, are at the very least skeptical and often angry with or ashamed of Russia for starting this war.

I heard of Russian aviators who threw Chechen prisoners, screaming, out their helicopters. There were rapes, but it was hard to know how many because women were too ashamed to report them. One girl was raped in front of her father. I heard of one case in which the mercenary grabbed a newborn baby, threw it among each other like a ball, then shot it dead in the air.
Leaving the village for the hospital in Grozny, I passed a Russian armored personnel carrier with the word SAMASHKI written on its side in bold, black letters.

""Got questions about why I think it is genocide. Until this morning I resisted applying the term. War crimes? Sure. Heinous rhetoric? You bet. What changed is the combination of more and more evidence, from different places, and even more importantly, explicit official rhetoric

The official legal definition of genocide is ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such"". When I teach genocide I start by saying that this definition has huge problems because it doesn't give us clear thresholds (what ""in part"" does even mean?) and because it is almost impossible to prove intent. People who carry out genocide are usually not idiots, if there are orders at all they would be given orally.

But, several things are important to realize. First, something that doesn't start as genocide might evolve into one when conditions change. Russian invasion, in my view, did not start with clear genocidal intent, but evolved into one. Regime change and colonial subjugation are by themselves not enough to constitute genocide. Second, more evidence that Bucha is not an exception. Each massacre might be local initiative, together they are a campaign. And most importantly, the RIA Novosti (a state outlet) piece is one of the most explicit statements of intent to destroy a national group as such that I've ever seen I know Russian. I have read a lot of Russian nationalist rhetoric in my life. This is not some wild intellectual fantasy, it is a clear, actionable statement of intent by a state agency. The UN definition is problematic, but in this case it fits like a glove""",False,1649082838.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,38,0,38,0,0,

From CNN's Whitney Wild

A 255-foot luxury yacht owned by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg was seized by Spanish law enforcement Monday at the request of US officials, according to the US Department of Justice. 

Vekselberg has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his case marks the first seizure of a newly formed US task force, called KleptoCapture, dedicated to cracking down on sanctions violators in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

“It will not be the last,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement Monday. “Together, with our international partners, we will do everything possible to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue its unjust war.”

“The seizure of this luxury yacht demonstrates our determination to hold accountable those who support Vladimir Putin’s unwarranted invasion of another sovereign nation,” said US Attorney Matthew M. Graves for the District of Columbia.

Excerpts:

***What are your scenarios for the future? Where does the war in Ukraine lead Putin and Russia, and what does that mean for your movement?***

  
*There are three basic scenarios, which are the same for pretty much every authoritarian regime. The three scenarios are, first, biological death. Because Putinism is not able to survive after Putin. It’s all built on one single personality. There’s nothing else but Putin in Putinism. Nothing else.*  
  
*Other than biological death, there is some popular uprising, like black-swan-type event. When they make the public expression of dissent impossible for many years, this could lead to an unpredictable explosion, very suddenly, for some reason that many people would consider irrelevant.*  
  
*And the third scenario is the political elite, Putin’s inner circle, decides they’re not interested any more to work with him.*  
  
*So these three scenarios have not changed due to the war in Ukraine. But the probabilities have changed very much. I no longer believe there is a high probability that Putin will be able to balance the system long enough to stay in power until his biological death. So the probabilities of the second and third scenarios have increased dramatically. But I can’t think of a different scenario.*  
  
***What about in the more medium term? What kind of country is Russia after a long, protracted conflict with Ukraine? And how does the Navalny movement capitalize on that?***

  
*You know, in many ways, surprisingly, I’m quite optimistic here. Many things that were impossible before, Putin made possible. Consider Russia after this enormous disastrous war has finally ended, and after Putin is gone. What will be this Russia? What does Russia become? For instance, me and Alexei \[Navalny\], in our discussions, we were talking a lot about how challenging it will be to exercise political campaigns in a post-Putin Russia, even when there are free elections. Because there will be a huge nostalgic party, a huge party of Putin supporters, that will be present in the parliament. They would get maybe like 20% or 30% of the votes. We would probably be forced to build coalitions with them.*

*So imagine, there was no war. Putin dies. Navalny is released. There are fair elections, and there is a Putinist party, like the Francoists in Spain after \[dictator Francisco\] Franco, or even like the Gaullists in France after \[President Charles\] De Gaulle. Okay, the authoritarian leader has gone. But for many people, there will be a lot of nostalgia. Now, this is ruled out. In post-war Russia, Putin’s party will be non-existent. This will be like how the Nazi party didn’t exist in Germany in the 1950s and 60s. We will have our version of the Nuremberg trials. After the crimes of Putin’s regime are made clear and explained to everyone, people will learn in high school about what Putin did and who he actually was.*",False,1649061885.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,27,0,27,0,0,

The poll was conducted in all regions of Ukraine (including Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) from September 12-25, 2014 with a randomly selected sample of 1,200 permanent residents of Ukraine aged 18 and older and eligible to vote.  The margin of error does not exceed plus or minus 2.8 percent, and the response rate was 63 percent.

The survey was conducted by Baltic Surveys/The Gallup Organization, with field work carried out by Rating Group Ukraine.  The survey was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development.”",1649086733.0,1649086384.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,32,0,32,0,0,

Ukraine has made it clear that no new territory will be given in a peace deal. Period.

After the annexation, Ukraine blocked the canal and Crimea was running out of water. Even if Russia gets just the previous borders back, they won't have any way to supply Crimea with water other than very expensive infrastructure changes.

So Putin can't back down on getting new territory, and Ukraine won't back down on giving away new territory (especially with what happened in Bucha).

About two thirds of Russian troops that were centered around Ukraine’s capital city, Kyiv, have “departed the area,” a senior US defense official told reporters Monday. 

The troops that have left the area around Kyiv are “heading north,” and “consolidating in Belarus,” the official said. 

“What we continue to believe is that they’re going to be refit, resupplied, perhaps maybe even reinforced with additional manpower, and then sent back into Ukraine to continue fighting elsewhere,” the official added. 

The US “assessment” is that these troops will be “applied in the eastern party of the country, in the Donbas region,” to fight there, the official said. 

“Our best assessment, and it is only an assessment, is that they will be applied in the eastern part of the country in the Donbas region, but that is an assessment only,” the official said.

A “bitter fight” continues over Mariupol, but “there are no indications that the Russians have made any progress” in taking the city, the official said.

Russian forces are now “much more to a defensive posture” around Kherson, the official said.

“We assess that in the Kherson area, as we’ve been talking about for the last few days, the Russians have kind of gotten pinched between Kherson and Mykolaiv. We now assess that they’ve shifted much more to a defensive posture around Kherson,” the official added.

I recommend the show (it's on Netflix), it's Zelenskyy's presidential sitcom and it goes into Ukrainian politics and their  fight with corruption. It has the same vibe as 30 Rock, so it's zany and light-hearted. There is one serious moment in the show that is one of Zelenskyy's best moments. It is an epic monologue about abuse of power and the cynicism that enables it.

Truss said she will be working with Britain's partners and allies to go further on sanctions, noting that the UK is looking into added measures ""in banning Russian ships from our ports, in cracking down on Russian banks, in going after new industries for filling Putin’s war chest like gold, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate our imports for Russian oil gas and coal.”

“We need to do more on oil and gas, which are key to funding Russia’s war machine,"" the foreign secretary said. ""We’ve agreed that the United Kingdom will end our imports on oil by the end of this year.”

Truss added that there should be ""no talk of removing sanctions while Putin's troops are in Ukraine and the threat of Russian aggression looms over Europe.""

The rhetoric told in Russia is nothing short of what was happening in Nazi Germany in mid 1930s, today's piece on state media about Ukraine question calling for genocide is just another escalation that is going towards the Final Solution of the Jews plan of Nazis. We aren't there yet but these pieces will fuel the public eventually to the point where nothing short of complete military conquest of the West will be acceptable.

**The longer we allow this to go on the more probably a confrontation becomes that is far wider than Ukraine.**  The more war crimes are uncovered the more Putin will be cornered in addition. **If anyone thinks Putin will let war crime trials against him or his military take present without a major escalation they are wrong in my opinion.** Putin can't be seen as weak in Russia, that's when his reign ends. Soon not going to war with west is weak in Russia.

We should seriously start preparing a measured military involvement only inside Ukraine's territory. Start with some PR votes in UN about military involvement suggested by Ukraine on their territory to stop war crimes etc. Russia will of course veto but these votes are just to show how little support they have. I really do believe if we take a very measured and public position of our intents there won't be a world war 3 over NATO entering Ukraine's territory (make sure we will not enter Russia's territory).

As sanctions continue to increase in severity against the Russian economy, targeting key sectors of business and industry including citizens, I wonder if the West has their “sanction of sanctions” — and what will that sanction be?

We’ve seen war crime after war crime, bodies littered on the roadways and cities of Ukraine from Mariupol to Kyiv, listened to Zelensky’s pleas for relief. What would the act have to be to even trigger the final of all sanctions to hit?

As the war rages on by either attrition or it’s current pace, the damage it and Russia inflicts won’t be only to Ukraine as the world food shortage stemming from the war will be felt by countries from the Middle East to Africa and too in Western countries in terms of rising price and availability of product rather than likelihood of a widespread famine.

 237 respondents *total* (out of an estimated 240k) during the Chernobyl accident *itself* were considered for acute radiation syndrome. Of those, 134 were confirmed. Of those, 28 died in the short-term (<2 mo). 14 more died within *30ish years*. *Internal contamination* (inhalation of radioactive particles) was of relatively minor importance in treatment.   
   
All this to say, the odds of a glowing tankie are relatively low. They may well develop cancer and have reproductive issues, but I would be very surprised to hear they've keeled over within a month.  Chernobyl isn't nearly as radioactive as it used to be, its scariest isotopes (in terms of the rate at which they emit) were gone within a year or two and [the ones people are currently concerned about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Forest) are around [45% as strong as they used to be](https://www.calculator.net/half-life-calculator.html?type=1&nt=&n0=100&t=36&t12=30&x=44&y=20).

>The Chernobyl accident resulted in almost one-third of the reported cases of acute radiation sickness (ARS) reported worldwide. **Cases occurred among the plant employees and first responders but not among the evacuated populations or general population. The diagnosis of ARS was initially considered for 237 persons based on symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Ultimately, the diagnosis of ARS was confirmed in 134 persons. There were 28 short term deaths of which 95% occurred at whole body doses in excess of 6.5 Gy.** Underlying bone marrow failure was the main contributor to all deaths during the first 2 mo. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation was performed on 13 patients and an additional six received human fetal liver cells. All of these patients died except one individual who later was discovered to have recovered his own marrow and rejected the transplant. Two or three patients were felt to have died as a result of transplant complications. Skin doses exceeded bone marrow doses by a factor of 10-30, and at least 19 of the deaths were felt to be primarily due to infection from large area beta burns. **Internal contamination was of relatively minor importance in treatment.** By the end of 2001, **an additional 14 ARS survivors died from various causes.** Long term treatment has included therapy for beta burn fibrosis and skin atrophy as well as for cataracts.

1. It only strengthens Putin's position internally because it makes it look like western leaders are still willing to deal with him. Putin already knows what the west thinks and doesn't give a rats ass. His only concern is increasing his legitimacy internally. What Putin is doing is the equivalent of a teenager talking to a good looking girl at school in order for a medium looking girl to notice that he is talking to good looking girls. The teenager in question knows that the good looking girl has no interest in him but he is using her to get the attention of the medium looking girl. Putin is presenting his conversations with Macron and Scholz as the west still considering him legitimate. Macron can do what Biden does and only have a nuclear hotline with Putin.
2. The war won't end with a diplomatic solution or with a political solution. It will end with a military solution. The political treaty will only reflect the realities on the battlefield. If Ukraine takes back territory it will keep them. It Russia defends Crimea and Donbas it will keep these territories. The political and diplomatic talks will only confirm what is on the battlefield. WW2 didn't end with a political solution, it ended with some treaties determined by allied victories on the battlefield.
3. Macron warned Biden against saying mean things to Putin because he is worried about French business interests in Russia. French companies are the largest foreign employers in Russia and French companies like Leroy Merlin are the most pro Russian and pro Putin companies out there. Macron couldn't give a rats ass about the massacres in Ukraine. He only cares about the profit margin of French companies.
4. As proof of the above Macron has not obtained a single success after these negotiating with Putin. What Macron will do is that he will wait for Ukraine to defeat Russia with weapons sent by the USA, UK, Sweden and Germany and then claim he had a role in negotiations. Basically he is the in real life equivalent of the ""my job here is done"" meme with a sprinkle of genocide and massacres.",1649094885.0,1649094661.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,20,0,20,0,0,

Ukrainians are not your enemy & the world did not see Russia as its enemy.  Your commanders, your government and Putin had been lying to you to fight in Ukriane for nothing.

This is exactly what some of your Russian soldiers are doing inside Ukraine - inside somebodyelse's homeland.  Definitely not yours & definitely not what your government & Putin told you that you are entitled for.

I can imagine inside Russia, you may not have a lot or wealth to protect but you may have someone to protect.

An outsider like you would never understand that Ukrainians would NOT just surrender everything they build & believe in, and agree to return to a 3rd world like most places inside Russia.  An outsider like you can never change locals' love for their homeland & accept unfair treatment & old outdated ideology.

Can you imagine yourself welcoming the intruders & their mates who kill your father, beaten your mother, raped wife & children in your own home?  Nope.  You will fight them until your last breath! I am sure.

Do retreat from Ukraine, Do disobey the senseless orders from the top or from Putin, Do whatever you can to escape the army & destroy the weapons, Do surrender rather than dying in foreign land knowing nothing.

You will be forgotten since you are the Soar thumb for Russia - your total existence reminds Putin, Russia, the people that you failed to capture Kyiv; failed your mission; failed Russia.

Online it said they provide people with essentials, including clothing.  My Cat had pooped 3 times on my jacket and that jacket was old and had holes in it, so given that clothing stores are closed (sort of like Covid where only essential stores are open - although some restaurants are opening up), I went there to ask for a jacket and they told me that the donations are only for people from Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol and that as an American (I'm Chinese American - they asked where I was from and I told them) I should be able to afford stuff.

I think it is too bad the donations that they are getting from abroad are only going to people from those cities because everyone in Ukraine is affected.  Most people have been unable to go to work since the invasion started due to employers deeming it unsafe to reopen and even if you do have money, you don't have a chance to buy things. In grocery stores, essentials like pasta and rice are often out for a week or more at a time, and you have to go to the more expensive store, which is double the price.  I would have thought that people donating things to Ukraine cared about everyone affected.

But the weather's warming up so I guess I'll be ok w/o a jacket and just wearing my hoodie soon :)

,tvso4l,i3fc6ie," I’m really torn on NATO intervention. Do I agree that we should be doing much more, everything possible? Absolutely. But I’m still thinking about the nukes. I’ve seen some comments in other threads saying things like, we could take out all of Russia’s nukes in 30minutes or that we could easily roll over their military and Putin wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I would love to be proven right, and for people to educate me if I am wrong, but these statements don’t make sense to me. 

*First, I 100% support Ukraine and appose Russia in all of this. I am not qualified to make any factual statements about the specifics of the Russian military or anything else for that matter. This is only my uneducated opinion. I’m just an arm-chair documentary watcher who’s read a few things in my spare time about military world powers over the years. My purpose is not to demoralize or criticize Ukraine in any way but to learn more. I am hopeful for Ukraine, for the end of the killing, and survival of its people.*

“Can we take out all of Russia’s nuclear assets before they can launch them? “

I am 99% certain we could not. Russia has nuclear ICBM submarines. These stay hidden under arctic ice for extended periods so no one knows exactly where they are. Once they receive the signal, the subs surface through the ice and launch their missiles. Once the ICBM re-enter the atmosphere, they can theoretically target any location on the globe and are almost impossible to stop. Each ICBM can have a 12+ separate independent warheads, with separate targets. When they re enter earth’s atmosphere, they reach super sonic speeds. The most technologically advanced counter measures have a low probability rate of successfully tracking and hitting these warheads due to how fast they are moving. 

I believe Russia also has short range tactical artillery nukes that can be used against a NATO ground invasion. Think normal artillery shelling, but each shell causes a nuclear explosion.  

Even if you have a way to target all subs, mobile launchers, bombers, silos, and individual warheads (that could be used as man-portable terrorist style weapons) simultaneously, all it takes is one to get through. Then it is game over. 

Lastly, how will other outside countries with nuclear weapons respond? If NATO invades, there is a risk that other non-NATO allies will get involved. Not necessarily to protect Russia, but to protect themselves from further NATO influence. Many other countries also have nuclear capabilities. It only takes one nuclear launch to put all other nuclear capable countries on alert and to signal immediate launches of their own (you never want to be the last one who launches their nukes in a nuclear war). 

So even if NATO was able to take out all of Russia’s nukes before they are used, what about the rest of the world? For example, are we confident in the communication and tracking abilities of everyone else at this stage? For example, other countries might see Russia attempt an ICBM launch. What happens next? If NATO disables it before it can hit anything, does everyone get the message? Maybe I detected the launch but am unable to track it. Do I assume it was successful and that things have already escalated past the point of no return? Do I risk waiting or do I automatically launch my own missiles based on the information I have?  

Are all the leaders of nuclear armed countries logical, humane, moral, or sane? How many would choose self preservation, retaliation in anger, or take advantage of the situation for their own expansion of power? I don’t trust Putin, and I don’t trust that others in leadership have the ability to stop him. One might say, that would be suicidal. No way Putin wants to blow himself up. Well, what if it got to the point where Putin saw he was going to lose power and be held accountable for what he has done. Putin is Putin’s whole world. So if Putin is going down, why not take the rest of the world with him? He’s proven how unstable and narcissistic he is.

To me, in my limited knowledge, the risk of nuclear war is still too great. My one thought is that, maybe now, with the heavy loss of lives and morale, the Russian people (military, leadership, and civilian, with exception of Putin) will throw down their weapons out of self preservation. Seeing how badly they have performed in trying to conquer Ukraine, the reality of a hopeless war with NATO might deter obeying orders or fighting any further. This of course assumes knowledge of the facts and not a propagandized populace. That is a lot of big if’s and maybe’s to weigh against the risk of global nuclear war.

I absolutely believe NATO and the rest of the world should be doing everything to stop Russia. I don’t know where the line is for avoiding escalation to nuclear war. It’s all theoretical, as it has never happened before. I think you can continue testing that line to some degree without it escalating though. For things like tanks and jets, will that really escalate Russian response? Why do they even need to know where the weapons came from? I am hoping that maybe there is a lot of covert action taking place against Russia which we don’t know about. But that doesn’t change the fact that tens of thousands of civilians are still being murdered. I want to see the end of this and whatever Ukraine needs, should be given. 

Since Russia seems to be on the retreat, maybe this is a perfect opportunity to justify moving in “peace keeping” forces to protect civilians. I am less worried about Russian escalation in their demoralized state. It seems easier for them to stop and retreat than to try and continue. But “I am not a well educated person so I might be wrong about everything I’ve said.”

Please let me know if anything I’ve said is incorrect or what it is I am missing. 

If I was living I Ukraine right now, I absolutely would be asking for additional military intervention. For Ukrainians, it is already Armageddon. The risk of further escalation isn’t much of a concern when your whole world is already on fire. If you lost your family, are you really worried about the possible impact to me, living safely on the other side of the planet? No, and you shouldn’t be. Ukrainians should only be concerned with their own lives and survival right now. 

It is easy for me to say any of this because I don’t live there or know anyone who does. This war does not currently impact my life directly. It is easy for me to read about military conflicts until I get to the civilian portions. I can stay somewhat emotionally detached until the reality of the horrors becomes visible. I like to think I’m open to learning from others and growing in my individual humanity, but I’m struggling between my heart and my head. My head tells me the numbers don’t add up, the risk is too great. My heart tells me it doesn’t matter, every life is worth saving, no matter the cost.

I am hopeful. Hopeful that the lives lost will not be in vain. To save future lives from future conflicts by deterring future aggression. I hope Ukraine becomes the central country of peace for the world. A utopia for its citizens and future generations. A model and symbol of hope for a world without conflict. But mostly, I hope Ukrainians stop dying and that all of you, your friends, and your families, live.",False,1649117792.0,t3_tvso4l,t3_tvso4l,,0,-15,0,-15,0,0,

Propaganda works because it employs little bits of truth with lots of lies and falsehoods and if you feed people propaganda long enough, even the strongest will develop doubts. It's hard for us to imagine it, but we live in societies were propaganda does not surround us every day (unless you willingly do it, eg places like Facebook) and many people try to follow various forms of media to get a wider picture. 

But in places where the media is essentially owned by the ruling leadership or elite, it's extremely easy to just push out propaganda more and more. 

There was work done on asking how could Germans support Nazis. Propaganda was one thing, using people's xenophobia and anti-semitic thoughts to increase anti-Jewish sentiment was another, dehumanising Jewish people after that came next, and blaming all the world's ills on them later and people were happy to find someone to blame. But also - people do get swept up in mass hysteria/actions. If everybody around you does it, it makes you question in the rightness of your position/actions. There was a clip that was shared here or on Twitter some time ago, about an experiment with kids (from 50-70s potentially, black and white footage), where they had several kids who were asked questions. Question was X, right answer was A, but out of the 4 kids, three kids said the answer was B, and then the last kid also said B. When asked why, the kid said that they knew it had been A, but also everybody else said B, so they didn't want to say A. It's simplistic, but it works on masses too - if the masses choose A, when in reality they should choose B, many go with the masses. 

I loathe to add this here, but Goering told something like this during the Nuremberg trial detention to Gustave Gilbert. He said that no ordinary person wants war, but ultimately, every person can be brought to support it if the leadership shows them that they're under threat and not participating would endanger them even further.",False,1649064917.0,t3_tvso4l,t1_i3bxjtv,,1,26,0,26,0,0,

tl;dr:

Most Russians supported the invasion at the start. Their attitudes are changing now because retreating from Kyiv makes no sense given the propaganda said that Russia’s goal was to replace Ukrainian leadership, also the number of Russian deaths is higher than expected.

He basically begs us not to give up on the Russian people because he believes that in time the majority will oppose the war.  He looks tired, like he knows that it’s too late for that now.

Nukes you've already mentioned.

The other problem is the issue of China. So far, China has remained actually neutral. However, if Russia were existentially threatened that might not remain true. 

If America sent fighters and bombers, Russia might send their own AA equipment, fresh cruise missiles, armored trucks and logistics equipment and even fighters and bombers of their own, for example. 

The one thing America *could* do, but will not, is finally, once and for, come down on tax havens like God's own judgement. 

America is the ultimate guarantor of the world's small nation tax havens, places where everyone from Hollywood superstars to Wall Street bankers to Russian Oligarchs to corrupt Chinese bureaucrats to drug cartels can hide and wash their assets.

The West has the power to shut most of them down by cutting them off with punishing sanctions. They have not done so because a lot of billionaires would lose a lot of billions, and have to pay a bunch of taxes. 

Getting rid of them, though, would let sanctions go after the bulk of Russian oligarch wealth that was moved to havens with the help of western officials who delayed sanctions with enough warning for them to pull it off.

Kyiv has like, a 50+km radius, including subway tunnels and rivers for transport.

Run the math on a serious encirclement, and you realize that Russia simply doesn't have the manpower to guard every route into, or out of, the city.

Now imagine that one of those troops has a number of Javelins, and deep-knowledge of the underground subway system. These are 25-lb weapons that can kill a tank in the cover of darkness (3am in pitch-black) from 3-miles away.

So now the question is: what forces do you station in these subway tunnels, around bridges, at the rivers, and all other points, to perform a proper encirclement? If you prepare tanks, they die. If you prepare lighter vehicles, they'll get mowed down by machine guns.

I mean that's just not true. Plenty of countries negotiated with Hitler, some negotiated surrender, others joined alliances, some negotiated neutrality. The allies had backchannels constantly trying to negotiate with the Nazis to end the war. Sorry but I don't buy this idea that you just stop talking to your enemy, it doesn't make sense.

It's just that you shouldn't put all your eggs in that basket, you need to give your enemy a reason to negotiate by making them stare in the barrel of military defeat.

Certainly we're seeing a radicalization happen before our eyes and fanaticism leads to unpredictability and extreme actions for sure.

More likely than not this fanaticism will be used to move Russia to a situation where they can dedicate more resources to the war effort, as people are willing to accept the sacrifice that may entail. General conscription was out of the question a month ago, but suddenly doesn't seem so far away.

Still - we have to remember that the Russians are about 2-3 weeks ""behind"" in their emotional reaction to this situation from us. At the beginning, it was for them just a small military action, not something that was important or would affect them in any way. Whereas for us, it's been a huge part of our news cycle and it's reshaped the foundations of EU politics, energy strategy and the NATO alliance. 

Only when the war became unavoidable, did it take hold in the collective Russian psyche, so we're not seeing the ""rally around the flag"" or ""[defensive consolidation](https://postsocialism.org/2022/03/04/defensive-consolidation-in-russia-not-rally-around-the-flag/)"" effect with a delay compared to us.

Right now the narrative is being pushed that this is a temporary situation. In a few months when Russia has won the West will forget, we will want their oil and gas, and everything will be OK. That narrative exudes strength, is the most attractive one to believe in and is impossible to disprove because it takes place in the future. 

Effectively, the leadership has won time with this. But the question remains what will happen if the war in Ukraine does not go their favour. Their army has systemic issues that won't be fixed overnight, you can't just snap your fingers and get a good morale or good leaders. The sanctions will keep biting harder and harder and while propaganda is all good and well, it doesn't hide bodybags coming home, or empty places at the dining table.

I don't pretend to know how this will go, and I certainly believe that we have not yet seen the worst part of this war, but I also think that right now Russians are experiencing an authoritarian high, fueled by promises of a future dream that likely will run into the jagged cliffs of reality in the coming months. Putin, as any authoritarian, is only successful when he is perceived to be powerful - and his power is being challenged in a highly significant way.

Secondly, we still have ways to go to sanction Russia. There are banks we could sanction further. But at one point comes a point where the question is - what now? 

And I think many Western countries - very reluctant to actually consider physical engagement like in the Balkans, for obvious reasons - are very reluctant, even afraid, to push sanctions to the point where there really are no more sanctions to add. That's why they trickle them in, I think.

Because once we use up all the sanctions, then - at least from the EU side - there's only two more options, I think (unless we can get China on-board, and that seems very unlikely to me, perhaps only if Russia would go fully completely insane and use a tactical nuke or something). The two options are completely shutting of Russian gas and oil, which will have tremendous effect in Europe, and getting physically involved.

The russian gas and oil issue could have deeper ramifications. We think Europeans are all pro-Ukraine, and I think many are, but people are.... idk what's the word. They'll see an increase in their bills and/or less heating for their house and they will blame their governments and will elect a new, more authoritarian, more extremist government (who has connections/financing from Russia ofc). 

Energy and electricity prices in Europe since last end of summer last year have been through the roof due to several reasons and at least here, people have been grumbling how the government doesn't do anything or doesn't do enough to lower the costs and of course the extremist party uses it to their advantage. I can only imagine how the costs would skyrocket if we'd shut Russian gas and oil. Private homes are one thing, but whole businesses, hospitals etc. in Europe would be affected.

And yes - ofc the lives of Ukrainians are important, ofc there should be no question about this when it comes to either cheap russian gas or the butchering of ukrainians. The problem is that a large share of Europe has gotten itself onto the Russian gas to a degree that all pipes go to the east - there are no (or only very few, marginal) alternative pipelines, no alternative infrastructure, even the potential to source more gas and oil with such a short notice (5-6 months until new winter season, the true problem for private consumers) is questionable. 

Ofc this is a European f-up, because it shows how blindly we've all allowed ourselves to be tied to just one single entity that is now wanting to slowly close the noose.

So if you ask what are the Hail Mary sanctions? That would be it from Europe - sanction all the banks, cut off all the gas and oil completely, and stop any kind of economic/cultural/etc cooperation with Russia, would be my guess.

And if that doesn't work - then what? I can bet this is the question on the minds of many politicians. We may have no choice BUT to actually get physically engaged and many people don't want that.Extremely complicated.",False,1649063170.0,t3_tvso4l,t1_i3bv0n3,,1,4,0,4,0,0,

As long as the Ukrainians continue to receive arms and armour from NATO, their superior morale and training will almost certainly mean Russia is going to be in trouble.

On the other hand, Russia still enjoys vastly superior fire power, armour and has the potential to send many more troops to the front than Ukraine can. This can't be discounted.

Okay, but you need to think this through. ""Someone, anyone"" would almost certainly be a NATO country, unless you have someone else in mind, and a a NATO country stepping in would likely trigger a world war.

Even without nukes, a world war would kill a lot of people, including more civilians. Putin will bomb hospitals in Poland and Moldova and Berlin as well as Ukraine, for example. Ukrainian refugees will have fewer places to hide, and increasing the scale of the war will generate new waves of refugees from new countries.

Now throw in the very real threat of chemical weapons. Poke the bear, and Putin may resort to using them on children like Assad did in Syria. Google that if you want to see what it looks like.

Now let's factor in nukes. ""F that threat of nukes,"" you say. I won't go into too much detail about what nuclear war would mean, but even use of tactical nuclear weapons would cause devastation in already devastated civilian populations.

Bucha is horrible, and Putin does need to be stopped. But there are good reasons the global community is not doing anything that might be interpreted by Putin as an act of war.

It's really easy to suddenly start getting caught up on this conflict now and say ""somebody do something."" If you want to say ""F that threat of nukes"" or ""it’s time someone calls [Putin's] bluff"" or ""someone anyone needs to step in now,"" keep in mind that the cost of stopping Putin may be a larger-scale war and many, many more deaths of innocent people. Are you comfortable with that?

Edit: to u/pantie_fa below: I assumed everyone knows how NATO works, but evidently not. There are 30 countries in NATO, and if one NATO country steps in, they all step in. That's how NATO works. If 30 countries including all of North America and most of Europe go to war against Russia in Ukraine, that's a massive step in the direction of world war.

Well - so are we here in the Baltics. 

Except that unlike Germany that has done everything it has been able to redeem itself and to apologise to victims of Nazis, Russia has not done the same. Germany has said never again, and yet it allows Russia to do the same. 

The people in the Baltics were taken to Siberia in cattle cars by the Russians. Prior to that, men and women were separated, sometimes men were straight out shot and killed before any cattle car even started to move. Our fault was that we existed, nothing else. 

We were not able to live free and to hear Russia apologise post-WWII. Russia has never apologised. It gloats and shoves it into our faces that it ""liberated"" us.

Ukraine moved pretty quickly to clear them out and would have succeeded, but Putin couldn't have his puppets defeated so quickly, so he sent a couple of armies in to help, which pretty quickly pushed back the Ukrainians and captured most of the currently occupied territory plus Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, and other towns.

The Ukrainians regrouped, called up reserves and formed citizens' militias, which were able to fight back and retake a number of towns until things stalemated at the current contact line.

They’ve provided food, weapons, ammo, intel etc etc which is probably as much as they can give. There is talk of giving jets, tanks, whatever else, but it’s a big upscale from weapons and ammo, to suddenly providing equipment like planes and infantry vehicles.

Russia has stated they’d only use a nuke if they thought their own existence (so Russia itself) is at stake and is threatened, now, we don’t know at what point they really draw that line. 

We’ve never seen America actually go to DEFCON level 1 (I think 2 was the highest during Cuba crisis) so we don’t fully know the extent of their abilities to actually defend against nuclear warheads that may be fired at them.

My understanding of these tanks is that they, like the aforementioned MiGs, are in the possession of other NATO countries. If that's the case, and I understand it correctly, those nations are free to send the tanks to Ukraine themselves. 

The US is leading all other nations in the amount of aid and Intel being provided to Ukraine, but people still push this narrative like it's entirely on the US as to what gets delivered to them. European nations could send their stuff, but look to Daddy America to be the face of it all. Weird.

 >The Dirlewanger Brigade, also known as the SS-Sturmbrigade Dirlewanger (1944), or the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (German: 36. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS), or Black Hunters, was a unit of the Waffen-SS during World War II. The unit, named after its commander Oskar Dirlewanger, consisted of convicted criminals who were not expected by Nazi Germany to survive their service with the unit. Originally formed in 1940 and first deployed for counter-insurgency duties against the Polish resistance movement, the brigade saw service in anti-partisan actions in German-occupied Eastern Europe.

To get ahead of Russian propaganda, it's better to admit that yes, sadly there are (Neo-)Nazis everywhere - they are a minority, though. The ultra-right wing party in Ukraine had a miniscule proportion of votes. Somewhat more troubling are things like Ukraine [in April 2015 declaring OUN as ""freedom fighters""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists) and [the ambassador of Ukraine to Germany honoring Bandera himself](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/botschafter-ukraine-deutschland-101.html) (second link in German only - sorry). We need to acknowledge these things - and we do. However, as opposed to Russia - such things are actually deemed problematic in the West.

Meanwhile - Ukraine has elected a jewish President, *hasn't* led a war of aggression against their neighbors, *hasn't* perpetrated ethnic cleansing and *hasn't* committed genocidal acts - while the regular Russian army *has definitely done all of that*, the DNR Lt. Col. mentioned above is clearly displaying definite Nazi insignia (see above) and [the Wagner group has strong ties to Neo-Nazis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/russian-mercenaries-in-ukraine-linked-to-far-right-extremists)... none of which seem to bother Russia in the slightest, showing that their pretense of ""de-nazifying"" Ukraine is just exactly that - a pretense, and an incredibly flimsy and transparent one at that.

Any deep hatred towards Russia and Russians in Ukraine now is a completely legitimate and direct result of Russia's genocidal campaign. 

They would have been (actually had been) welcomed among the liberal-democratic nations of the world... but through corruption, irridentist aspirations and now the act of perpetrating an actual genoncial war of aggression, Russia has slammed that door shut and rendered itself a pariah. 

In the beginning of this campaign - pretty much everybody was giving the Russian people the benefit of the doubt - calling this *Putin's war*. Through their actions and inactions, they managed to show the world that this is not the case.

Early in the war, I came across this article talking about Anatoly Sobchak and his widow, Lyudmila Narusova . Sobchak was originally Putin's ""mentor"", and believed he was ""a man who really thinks about the state... not about his own interests and needs."" 

Sobchak died in 2000 of one of those mysterious ""heart attacks."" In this 2015 article, Narusova says:

>""It's definitely true, in the sense that Putin is a person who believes he's been given a special mission, that he's a statesman . . . ""He really thinks that he understands the interests of the state and implements them accordingly.""

> ""But...'power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.' Fifteen years is a long time.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Narusova

Narusova has been critical of the war in Ukraine, saying: 

>""I do not identify myself with those representatives of the state that speak out in favor of the war. I think they themselves do not know what they are doing. They are following orders without thinking."" She also stated that Russian soldiers in Ukraine lay ""unburied; wild, stray dogs gnawing on bodies that in some cases cannot be identified because they are burned.""[8] 

>On 4 March Narusova told the Federation Council, in livestreamed proceedings, of the heavy losses Russian forces were suffering in Ukraine. She claimed to know of a 100-strong Russian conscript company of whom ""only four were left alive"" when the unit was withdrawn.[9]",False,1649108158.0,t3_tvso4l,t1_i3eg2nh,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

The Victory Day Parade will be dominated by Russian Navy units since the parade units of the Russian Army are either dead in Ukraine or broken and being reformed.

Said Parade will be the abridged cliff notes version due to all the high tech weapons and vehicles being destroyed or lost to Ukraine.  I mean, they could go old school and roll the T-34s, T-55s out.

Prior to that, I feel that Russia is going to run out of PGMs, cruise missiles, SRBMs and will lose the ability to strike deep into Ukraine, which maybe why they have stepped up infrastructure attacks in the last week, they want to hit the targets while the missiles are in stock.

Personally, I think sending the remnants of the Kyiv force to Donbas is going to backfire and zap the morale of the Donbas troops. They are sending a battered and beaten force into a theater that is just as intense if not higher intensity than what they just left.

Also, will Russia's logistic infrastructure be able to cope with the influx of troops? I think it will break under the increased demand.  If the logistics break, I expect to see a similar vaporization in Donbas as we saw in the north.",False,1649093339.0,t3_tvso4l,t1_i3d9crt,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Crimea is a peninsula only attached to mainland Ukraine by small land bridges, the largest of which is ~10 kilometers wide. That makes it an extremely difficult place for Ukraine to launch an assault on, particularly since the Russians have complete naval superiority in the Black Sea, and realistically that situation is unlikely to change since Ukraine doesn't really have a navy. Anti-ship missiles could help but it's likely Russia will retain some level of naval superiority in the Black Sea.

This means that an amphibious assault is impossible for Ukraine to use to support an attack across the land bridges, and their attacking troops on land will be getting hit with missiles launched from Russian ships.

The land bridges are so small that Russia could probably hold them with a relatively small force, it's not like they would need 50,000 troops to hold those chokepoints, 10,000 might be more than enough.

It's just a nightmare scenario for an attacking army. I think and hope that Ukraine can push back in the south and make it to mainland coastline, but pushing over the land bridges into Crimea would be incredibly difficult and bloody.

4d76270422665fbb57b379d80ad743df,tvso4l,i3cwci1,"Counter arguments to some points:

> The ruble has fully recovered

Russia is propping up the Ruble at the expense of everything else, and it's going to make their economic disaster even worse. This summarized it pretty well a couple days ago: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/01/opinion/russia-ruble-economy.html

> sanctions are not biting as hard 

The sanctions hit is going to be a slowly building disaster, in terms of how it cripples the country, not just an overnight snap. Slowly you're going to see attrition as spare parts and materials can't be acquired and things at every level of the economy grind to a halt. That includes oil/gas production, since they needed tech from the Western majors for all their new fields.

> Now they are recruiting reservists

Russian reservists need months to be formed to any remotely effective military unit. They are not like the US military reserves. They're a list of people who did a conscription term years ago. They don't have equipment assigned, they don't train, they don't have a unit or job. You're talking about taking some out of shape 30 year old who did a conscription term at 18 and going ""you're a soldier again!"".

Russia doesn't appear to have the ability to equip them, either. Many of the front line troops are already going in with inadequate equipment and shortages - we've seen 40 year old field dressings, MREs expired by years, etc. And those are what the current troops got. What do you think hastily outfitted reservists are going to get? A rusty Moisin-Nagant and a WWI helmet?

>  Besides, Europe and NATO only have so many missiles and not a lot of USSR equipment they can send.

Over time Ukraine can be equipped with more complex NATO/Western systems. Sending ex-USSR equipment is for stuff to use immediately. If (hopefully not) the war runs that long, I'd imagine we'd start training their crews, maintenance base, etc on those kinds of systems.

And I'd put a lot more faith in the combined weapons stockpiles and full production capacity of the US + Europe than Russia even before you factor in sanctions.

That is wrong. You are thinking about mass infantry charges which off the top of my head haven't been done in awhile since maybe Japanese in WW2 doing the bonsai charges or some African warlords since then have done mass infantry charges as well. But trenches, foxholes and front lines are still a thing in modern warfare.

edit; So yea, A recent example of trench warfare is the War in Donbass. To consolidate and defend their territory, government and rebel forces have dug trenches and have initiated warfare reminiscent of WW1, with troops staying in and fighting from trenches for months at a time using cement mixers and excavators at their lines for digging network tunnels and deep bunkers for protection. After the Minsk peace agreements the front lines did not move significantly until the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the two sides mostly fired mortars and sniper shots at each other.

It is not that NATO intervening in Ukraine directly will instantly cause nuclear apocalypse, but rather that NATO intervening directly could lead to a scenario where a series of seemingly reasonable choices or unintended miscalculations leads to a nuclear exchange. 

For example, NATO intervenes in Ukraine. To begin with they seek to establish air superiority. This requires SEAD (suppression of enemy air defense) operations targeting Russian AA sites. A great deal of the S-400 sites are in Russia itself.  NATO targets these in a limited strike but ends up killing some civilians by mistake. Russia responds by attacking trains inside of Poland they believe are loaded with weapons meant for Ukraine. Some of the trains are carrying civilians. NATO then responds by trying to eliminate Russian SRBM mobile platforms inside Russia, like Iskander-M launchers. Russia views this as an attempt to weaken the Russian nuclear deterrent and responds by torpedoing a US Ohio class guided missile sub. 

Holy shit, now the Pentagon is going bananas because they fear the nuclear triad is at risk. They put all nuclear forces on the highest alert level and scramble nuclear bombers.

After the cold War and particularly after Yeltsin, when Putin was thrust into power the West basically had two paths to deal with Russia.

1. Treat them as the long time foe they had been for decades and not trusting them

2. Increase diplomacy and trade with Russia in the hope they become a trusted ally and democracy.

There were obvious arguments for both paths and ultimately the cooperation path won over. The last 25 years is obviously a lot more complex than just two strategies and where the West perhaps failed was not accepting soon enough that Putin never wanted to cooperate, he simply played along while preparing for his actual war in typical KGB fashion.

Trade deals were put in place while Putin was also preparing to really infiltrate the West in their politics, buying politicians and other decision makers. Then utilising social media for further divide in the West.

This worked successfully to the extent of Brexit and other well known political stooges and tto the extent that it even seems like criticising Russia was seen as silly conspiratorial talk.

 >Ukrainian oligarchs are business oligarchs who emerged on the economic and political scene of Ukraine after the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum. This period saw Ukraine transitioning to a market economy, with the rapid privatization of state-owned assets. Those developments mirrored those of the neighboring post-Soviet states after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The influence of Ukrainian oligarchs on domestic and regional politics, particularly their links to Russia, has been the source of criticism from pro-Western sources critical of Ukraine’s lack of political reform or action against corruption.

 >The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (Ukrainian: Організація українських націоналістів, romanized: Orhanizatsiya ukrayins'kykh natsionalistiv, abbreviated OUN) was a Ukrainian ultranationalist political organization established in 1929 in Vienna. The organization first operated in Eastern Galicia (then part of interwar Poland). It emerged as a union between the Ukrainian Military Organization, smaller radical right-wing groups, and right-wing Ukrainian nationalists and intellectuals represented by Dmytro Dontsov, Yevhen Konovalets, Mykola Stsiborskyi, and other figures. The ideology of the OUN is described as similar to Italian Fascism.

According to the head of the Jerusalem office of the Simon Wiesenthal Center,   
   
>“One of the biggest problems we are facing now is something called the ‘double genocide theory,’ something prevalent throughout eastern Europe, where governments are trying to say that Communist crimes amounted to genocide,” he said. “They were not. If they were, then that means that Jews committed genocide. There were Jews – not out of any loyalty to the Jewish people, and usually Jews who left the Jewish community – who worked in the KGB, in the Communist security apparatus, and did horrible things. It’s true.”

Sometimes its because they want to appeal emotionally to a domestic crowd. Sometimes people are getting paid. Sometimes they're idiotic egomaniacs. But the end result is people doing profoundly stupid things over and over and over. 

Iraq II made no sense.

Trying to make Afghanistan a liberal democracy made no sense.

Nordstream made no sense.

Abandoning nuclear power made so sense. 

China choosing Trump's presidency to sever ties with western nations who were ripe for being turned made no sense.

Obama's ""reset"" with Russia made no sense.

The West continuing to design their societies and economies in a way that maximizes the rate of ecological degradation and mounting climate change makes no sense. 

The Republican refusal to confront COVID made no sense.

Trump's deep drive into deficit made no sense.

The USA bringing China into the WTO because ""making them richer will persuade them to become a democracy"" was a special kind of stupid. 

NATO disarming made no sense.

And, most of all, the invasion of Ukraine makes absolutely zero sense in any way whatsoever.

Narcissism is different from sociopathy. Sociopathy usually requires some additional things to make it dangerous. Sociopaths can think their way into solving problems. If they can't feel empathy, they can at least construct a facsimile out of logic.

It connects the White Sea, in the Arctic Ocean, with Lake Onega, which is further connected to the Baltic Sea. Until 1961, its original name was the Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal (Belomorsko-Baltiyskiy Kanal imeni Stalina). The canal was constructed by forced labor of gulag inmates.

Over the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.

  
Poland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia -- but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

  
The US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not ""tenable"" and deemed it too risky.

  
""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.

  
US officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

  
NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine -- even if done bilaterally -- could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.

He is paying a price for it. That's what the economic sanctions are for. It may not sound like much, but it's crippling the Russian economy. Don't underestimate how much that will hurt them - it's not just about economical hardship it's about ex-communicating them from the rest of the world.

Yeah, my own country isn't much better ATM and if it hadn't been for internal squabbles a few years ago, we would've broken our dependency on Russia by now, but we're doing what we can. Germany seems to be stubbornly insisting, for example, that its NPP cannot be, in any way or form, restarted. It *seems* like Germany is looking for excuses, not solutions. Granted, I'm going to admit that it seems to me also that their PR is just so bad - they need a good spokesperson or someone, who could basically explain things in simple terms as to WHY Germany cannot do XYZ. Right now, all people hear is ""we can't"", but if they provide the reasoning behind why they can't, people would be more receptive to their arguments. 

I still stand by my words though. I've heard it from so many people saying that Germany has a deep deep trauma that they're still dealing with and Russia's behaviour is bringing up some ugly memories. But nobody seems to understand that it's even worse for us. Realistically - because let's be honest, there's what? Some tens of thousands US soldiers in Germany alone - Russia would never invade Germany. It doesn't need it - it likes to toy with it, to ignite some of that fear Germany has, but it knows Germany is long gone. As long as it has Germany connected economically, Russia is good. 

But here - people are genuinely afraid. Despite what you read in the news, despite us being in NATO/EU and thus the situation being vastly different compared to Ukraine, people are afraid. People talk about bomb shelters, people talk about places to go and escape to, about where to go if Russians come. What we see in Ukraine is a memory or a personal experience that exists in nearly every family in the Baltics. I don't want to minimise Germany's trauma, it's not a competition, but it's incredibly harsh to hear of Germany, of all nations, being traumatised while everybody seems to dismiss our experiences with Russia. Nazi Germany inflicted trauma upon others and the Red Army then inflicted trauma on Germans. Well - the same happened here, twice actually by the Russians during WWII alone, expect then the trauma lasted 50 years. I don't think it's fair for Germany to proclaim they are still traumatised and thus unable to deal with Russia, considering that when we have wanted to confront the one-sided depiction of history of evil in Europe during the 20th century, the experiences of CEE under direct/indirect Soviet rule are somehow never seen as on par.

I'm more trying to say that I'm seeing a lot of people who seem to think Russia's defeat is a done deal and they are crashing to inevitable ruin that will cause the regime to collapse, when that's simply not true.

Yes, the ruble is propped up by measures that will economically ruin a lot of ordinary Russians in coming years. It's an open question whether Putin cares or if this is even a bad thing as far as he's concerned. Poorer people are more dependent and more easily controlled people.

Yes, the reserves will take time to train and months to form into a unit. They have months. This is a sign that they are in this for the long haul - prepared to continue a murderous campaign for years if need be. And why not? Politically, it appears to be all upside for Putin. The oligarchs are weakened, the opposition is finally completely disbanded, state control is expanded, and he gets political cover and support for his absolute rule. The question is, will the west fork over the tens of billions it will require for Ukraine, with its shattered economy and industry, to stay in this fight. We'd better. The alternative is genocide.

NATO which is a defensive organisation cannot be seen to be the aggressive party. It's an incredibly sensitive situation which may result in more negative consequences if not handled carefully. At most I could see NATO securing territory with no Russian soldiers so they can't return.

I don't think NATO is worried about a direct conflict as they're a superior force. Especially if working alongside the UA. I don't even think they'd be afraid of nukes being used but I do think they're likely concerned of the optics. They were hoping the sanctions would do the job would be my guess.

And yes, I see it in the same way. 

There were only two obstacles for Putin in his vision for the great Russian Reich: Nato and EU. Nato was /almost/ successfully dismantled / turned into insignificance by Putins puppet Trump.

And he tried to split the EU via the Brexit. But that didn't work as expected, since actually it turned out that the EU was stronger after the Brexit then before Brexit.

And in the center of all of this: Social Media. Facebook, Youtube, Twitter. All the mouthpieces for fringe stuff like QAnon. And albeit fringe this stuff is still extremely dangerous, like you can see in the Jan 6 riots. Just imagine for a second what would have happened had the riots succeeded and trump been reinstated in a then no-longer-democratic USA. The world stage would have been successfully prepared for the great russian reich.

In movies you always see the hero being the one person in charge for saving the universe. Like he and only he has the powers that can defeat the ultimate evil.

In reality, there was one villain (trump) who almost succeeded and no single hero to save us, but a whole lot of good people who stood against this villain.

And there can really be a scenario where this whole thing was planned in advance by the powers that are. Decades ahead by some think tank who knew this was inevitable.

But until we know (if ever) anything about such a scenario it would be wise to stick to what we really know. So not taking into account any of these scenarios what we know is that Russia once in the not-so-distant-past was a democracy. And then the Russian people due to ignorance, incompetence and a throwing-their-pearls-to-the-pigs-mentality gave that away and granted Vladimir Putin almost unlimited power combined with almost zero responsibility.

They let that happen! And they didn't object to it, like they didn't object to the Chechen war and the Georgian war. They didn't object to the barrel bombs killing Syrian people, they were ok siding with dictators like Bashar al-assad. If not for this the Syrian war could have resulted in a democratic syria. There was a real chance for this.

And the Russian people cheered all of that, they liked it. Or did you hear anything like mass protests during the decades this sh\*t happened? I certainly didn't.

And now they liked the Ukraine war. Maybe, just maybe the Russian people now have a chance to wake up to what they steered their ship into, but I doubt it. Too little to late, and there is the fallacy of the sunken costs at play.

My book club last week finished the Killers of the Flower Moon, which chronicles how the laws enabling the ""guardianship"" of Osage Oil wealth lead to the murders of many of the tribe.

This has nothing to do with the teaching of history or sociology in k-8, which was my point, although admittedly in 1972 as a jr high student in Oklahoma History course, the coverage of how Oklahoma came to be ""Indian Territory"" and then a state certainly would qualify as CRT, I suppose, under current Republican fear-mongering. How did the Cherokee wind up in Oklahoma, pray tell?  An explanation is......... CRT!

CRT fear-mongering is aimed at white suburban moms afraid that their kids will become sympathetic to minorities or trans.  There is nothing there.  Hell, my Oklahoma History teacher was a conservative Norwegian descendent who just wanted us to know how OK became a state, but unfortunately this required him to cover the history of the 5 Civilized Tribes and how they wound up in Oklahoma, despite being in the SouthEast before Andy Jackson.  This is no critique of Ed Engel, bless his soul; he was our tennis coach even though he never played a set of tennis his whole life; he was a teacher and a dry wheat farmer.

As I recall, since we had moved there from Missouri, I asked him a bunch of questions, and he answered them bluntly and correctly; I wouldn't say gracefully since Ed wasn't exactly grateful, he was a ""man of the sod"" but wouldn't lie to save his soul.

 >The Ukrainian War of Independence was a series of conflicts involving many adversaries that lasted from 1917 to 1921 and resulted in the establishment and development of a Ukrainian republic, most of which was later absorbed into the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of 1922–1991. The war consisted of military conflicts between different governmental, political and military forces. Belligerents included Ukrainian nationalists, Ukrainian anarchists, Bolsheviks, the forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary, the White Russian Volunteer Army, and Second Polish Republic forces.
 
**[Zaporozhian Cossacks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporozhian Cossacks)** 
 
 >The Zaporozhian Cossacks, Zaporozhian Cossack Army, Zaporozhian Host (Ukrainian: Військо Запорозьке, romanized: Viisko Zaporozke, or Військо Запорізьке, Viisko Zaporizke, Russian: Войско Запорожское, romanized: Voysko Zaporozhskoye) or simply Zaporozhians (Ukrainian: Запорожці, romanized: Zaporozhtsi, Russian: Запорожцы, romanized: Zaporozhtsy, Polish: Kozacy zaporoscy, Czech: Záporožští kozáci) were Cossacks who lived beyond (that is, downstream from) the Dnieper Rapids, the land also known under the historical term Wild Fields in today's Central Ukraine and Eastern Ukraine. Today, much of the territory is flooded by the waters of the Kakhovka Reservoir.

""eu·gen·ics

/yo͞oˈjeniks/

noun

noun: eugenics

the study of how to arrange reproduction within a human population to increase the occurrence of heritable characteristics regarded as desirable. Developed largely by Sir Francis Galton as a method of improving the human race, eugenics was increasingly discredited as unscientific and racially biased during the 20th century, especially after the adoption of its doctrines by the Nazis in order to justify their treatment of Jews, disabled people, and other minority groups.""

-definitiin from Oxford Languages, a dictionary 

Eugenics were part of the Nazis' justification for their genocide upon the Jews, the Slavs, and othe ethnics minorities. It also happens to be one same justifications that Putin's Russia is using in attempt to legitimize their invasion of and subsequent genocide upon the Ukrainian people.

Pretty much all of them rely on gas for heating water and homes (and then there are non-household buildings and industries). Do you know how much time and money it would take for an infrastructure of that scale to transition to an electric source? But yeah, at it's peak nuclear usage (2005) the German electricity grid was ~25% nuclear (~13% in 2020), so it definitely decreased which I agree was a bad move. Also, in 2010 gas made up ~8% of their electricity whereas in 2020 it's down to 6% (so that's a decrease of 25%) at least. And it's also important to keep in mind that things look waaaay different in hindsight. Before Russia started amassing their forces at the Ukrainian border last year, nobody would have thought that Russia would launch a full scale invasion of a sovereign nation near the heart of Europe. On the other hand, Germany's heavy reliance on coal energy seemed like a much more imminent threat to the world, so cutting the coal reliance by switching to the far less destructive natural gas for a couple of decades to buy time while transitioning to sustainable alternatives (hydro, solar, wind, etc) naturally seemed like a no brainer at the time, especially considering the extremely negative domestic perception of nuclear power (you can thank Chernobyl and Fukushima for that) not to mention various smaller issues they've had related to it as well as billion dollar plants being abandoned in neighbouring countries for similar reasons. But if you view it without these things taken into consideration, of course expanding their nuclear power sector would be a much more preferable choice, but reality doesn't always work out that way. Besides, none of this changes the fact that what's done is done and there's no way to change this overnight at the snap of a finger, and quarreling about it only benefits Russia. What we need now is solidarity in our efforts to stop Russia in whatever ways we reasonably can and pretty much everyone in Europe is trying their best (with some uncertainty in regards to parts of the Balkan; who knows what Orban, Transnistria, Serbia, etc will do).

It's not just a little bit of hardship that we can get rid of by wearing an extra sweater next winter, literally 2/3 of their energy portfolio imports come from Russia. Household heating is only a subset of that - imagine large chunks of industry no longer being able to manufacture because the raw material is expensive and unattainable, transport industry and electricity companies winding down because gas and petrol become extremely expensive. The fertilizer industry heavily relies on natural gas, so that would mean even less fertilizer for even higher prices, driving up global food prices and causing even more food shortages in developing countries. Do you see the knock-on effects yet? I don't think Americans are aware that we are paying the equivalent of 10 bucks per gallon for gas over here Already. These prices will rise so much that supply chain breakdowns will follow that make the bottlenecks we experienced during the pandemic look like a fucking cakewalk. And who do you think will be able to pay for the rebuilding effort for Ukraine if the biggest economy of Europe is torching itself just to save face?

It’s *supposed* to function similarly to what you’ve just described. And to some extent it still does aside from the upward trend of executive orders signed over the last century. It just hasn’t seemed that way because we are a two party system which means either we vote for the single opposition party for the house and senate or we have a stacked government where it’s political suicide to go against the president. 

If it weren’t for the two party thing our system would at least work better. The president still has way more power than they are supposed to because our congress is often split right down the middle. There are two reps in the senate out of our hundred who are independent. Of our 435 representatives, *none* of them are third party. 

So basically with the level of partisanship we’ve created over the last few decades our president fluctuates between having absolute power and being a lame duck depending on how good each party is at redrawing constituency lines and how high presidential approval is.

By denying that a genocide may be occurring (during the early stages, amid the warnings) you risk persisting in doing so to the point of denialism. 
       
Remember, Rwanda only took a few months. Large number of people are lost very quickly when these things happen.
       
We have to call out these actions and intent NOW because it's not much good waiting until it's finished. 
      
Much of the 100k in Mauripol could be lost in a matter of days as the city falls.
     
Edit: here is a summary of state propaganda pushing for genocide. This is Russian policy that they are poised to enact:
        
""it calls almost every Ukrainian a Nazi who deserves death. ""Nazis who took weapons, must be killed in numbers as much as possible... Not just the elites, the most of the people are guilty, they are passive Nazis, Nazi enablers. They supported these elites and must be punished""

It foresees tyrannic approach to culture. ""Further denacification of the mass of the population is to be reached through ideological repression (oppression) of Nazi ideas and through harsh censorship: not only in politics, but in culture and education areas"".

it foresees economic and political destruction of Ukraine: ""Ukraine must pay for its guilt towards Russia. It must be treated as an enemy, and therefore may develop only in dependency to Russia. No ""Marshall plan"" may happen. No ""neutrality"" both ideological or practical"".

A tyrannical future emerges: ""Personnel providing denazification in new denazified republics (plural! - Sumlenny) cannot act on another way but only with direct military-police and management support from Russia. Denazification must be a Deukrainisation"".

Ukraine is the enemy: ""The history has proven: Ukraine may not exist as a national state. Any attempt to create it leads to Nazism. Ukrainism is an artificial anti-Russian construct... De-banderisation is not enough... Denazification of Ukraine must be De-Europeazation of it"".

Deliberate targeting of civilians: ""The Bandera-elites must be liquidated, they cannot be re-educated. The social ""swamp"" who supported them must experience terror of war and learn the lesson, and pay for its guilt"".",1649066739.0,1649066478.0,t3_tvso4l,t1_i3c0nsz,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

The country's whose existence was used as an excuse to justify why trade wasn't working to bring peace because Russia rejected the free market and couldn't be ""tamed"" by it.

After reforms that created special economic zones where the free market could exist. Which did nothing in the long run seeing as China is still hostile and preparing for war for Taiwan and other neighbors. China held back by the fact NATO would defend Taiwan and any other allies in the region since they pivoted in 1991.

To be clear - I don't think there's any way to get enough LNG to meet German demand by this winter. But it is likely possible to get some level of LNG flowing directly into Germany for this winter.

It's also worth noting that you did sign a deal with Qatar for natural gas recently. Not sure the size of those flows, but you do have a significant new supplier lined up....once you can actually get the gas from A to B.

If NATO gets involved with the EXPRESS reason of repelling Russia, Russia would be INSANE to use nukes.  How do you twist that logic so much in your head.  Russia would withdraw nearly immediately.

Look it's simple.  If NATO gets involves and stays inside Ukraine's borders Russia loses a war.  That's it.  If Russia nukes, they ALL die (and so do we).  Russia is objectively better off withdrawing.  And that's exactly what they would do.

Over the weekend, the US said it was in discussions with Poland about a potential deal in which Poland would supply Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukraine has requested, and the US would then provide Poland with American F-16s.

  
Poland, however, on Tuesday took the US by surprise and offered to deploy all its MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine in its fight against Russia -- but by first sending the jets to US Ramstein Air Base in Germany, also a NATO nation.

  
The US Defense Department rejected the proposal as not ""tenable"" and deemed it too risky.

  
""The prospect of fighter jets 'at the disposal of the Government of the United States of America' departing from a U.S./NATO base in Germany to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" Kirby had said in a statement Tuesday.

  
US officials described the issue to CNN as twofold: a logistics problem of getting the jets to Ukraine, and a political problem of avoiding escalation with Russia. US officials described the Polish plan as failing to adequately address both.

  
NATO members have expressed concerns that providing fighter jets to Ukraine -- even if done bilaterally -- could be perceived by Russia as the alliance becoming directly involved in the war, NATO diplomats told CNN.

One, numbnuts, why do you think Putin is in Ukraine? Because he has lost his mind? Because he's a hopeless old anachronistic patriot trying to reconstitute the Soviet Union while destroying his country?

Two, flailing about with the genocide word as if applying a word to something is the very key to its resolution has nothing to do with anything. It's a distraction. If the killing of civilians was so odious to all you clowns, and to your clown governments, you would have had NATO troops in Ukraine independent of membership or upheld guaranteeing Ukraine's sovereignty. But you are more scared of Putin's nuclear words and wouldn't dream of provoking him ahead of the fact.

What you people are is behind the curve, degenerate in a way. You pretend you're moral, hell, hyper-moral, but many of you westerners are almost child-like. You react and overreact. Your democracies are often a joke if we judge by the quality and repetition of election campaigns. You just love to talk, and you love to act holier-than-thou without much serious critical thought as to whether you actually are. The holier-than-thou part isn't really the problem - that's a human pursuit. But many of you have descended into this state of oblivious, delusional twerpdom in which your thinking is quite short-sighted, it almost being more important how you sound as opposed to what you really are or end up doing.

Case in point, it was clear civilians would die. American intelligence even thought it would happen the American way through mass aerial bombing, although there have also been many warnings about ugly ground fighting. Massacres, torture, war crimes, these are common in war. How many genocides has the US been part of if everything is suddenly a genocide? Anyway, this was foreseeable and preventable. You had your chance to be responsible. Don't act shocked all of a sudden. As a recent US president said, ""It is what it is."" Good luck with your conveniently timed moral outrage. I'm sure Putin will subject himself to international justice the same as US presidents, whataboutism and all.
