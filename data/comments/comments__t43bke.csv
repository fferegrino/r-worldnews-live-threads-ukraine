Part of the article translated here;

THE HAGUE - According to the ambassador of Ukraine in The Hague, a 'considerable number' of Dutch people have come forward to join the Ukrainian army in the war against Russia.  Ukrainian President Zelensky announced on Sunday that he will establish a foreign legion.

""We are amazed at the number of registrations,"" Ukrainian ambassador Maksym Kononenko told De Telegraaf.  He does not want to name the exact number of registered Dutch people, because of 'privacy rules'.  “We have received a significant number of requests from Dutch citizens who want to join the Ukrainian armed forces.  We got those applications before President Zelensky made his announcement yesterday.”

Zelensky wants to set up a foreign legion to fight against the Russian troops.  It is unknown what exactly the foreign volunteers can do.  The Ukrainian embassy in The Hague also does not provide information about how Dutch volunteers will be deployed in Ukraine.

Sellers of military clothing and special equipment also see that there is enthusiasm to join the fight in Ukraine.  Gearpoint in Amersfoort has been busy since Thursday with people who want to buy items for Ukraine, such as special military medical kits that can be sent to the country as relief supplies.

The company also gets a lot of information requests through its website and phone calls from people who seem to want to join an international legion.  According to a Gearpoint seller, it concerns Ukrainians, but also Dutch people who previously worked for Defense or the police.  He estimates that there are groups of dozens of people in our country who are considering taking this step.

At Noorloos Equipment in Kaatsheuvel, a Dutch war volunteer was on the doorstep on Monday morning for stuff.  He would like to leave in a few days.  According to entrepreneur Jan Noorloos, it was someone who still works for the Ministry of Defense and wants to call in sick to fight in the Ukraine.",False,1646126253.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,34,0,34,0,0,

""We have had residential quarters shelled for five days. They are pounding us with artillery, they are shelling us with GRADS, they are hitting us with air forces,"" Vadym Boichenko said in a live broadcast on Ukrainian TV.

""We have civilian infrastructure damaged - schools, houses. There are many injured. There are women, children killed.""

Mariupol has lost electricity as a result of the attacks.

A Russian-backed separatist leader in eastern Ukraine said his forces aimed to encircle the Mariupol on Tuesday, Russian news agency RIA reported.

Dutch Stingers and anti-tank weapons arrived in Ukraine

The 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and the anti-tank weapons that the Netherlands has sent to Ukraine are on site. Commander of the Armed Forces General Eichelsheim confirmed this this morning at WNL on NPO Radio 1.

The weapons are now being handed over to the Ukrainian armed forces, Eichelsheim said at around 11:30 am. Since these are weapon systems that can be easily deployed, the highest-ranking Dutch military officer expects the Ukrainians to use them immediately.

""The Stingers can be deployed against planes and helicopters, which is exactly what Ukraine needs,"" Eichelsheim said. He won't say where the weapons were delivered for security reasons. ""It is up to the Ukrainian armed forces to determine where they will be deployed."" The cabinet decided to send arms after Ukraine had requested this from the Netherlands.",1646134282.0,1646133540.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,26,0,26,0,0,

#• BRICS - Association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

The BRICS states are an association for 5 major emerging economies around the world. The aim is to deepen economic, political and cultural co-operation between the member states. 

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

_Note: BRICS association could be one reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis_

#• CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

#• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

#• What are Thermobaric weapons?

Thermobaric or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermoberatic weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermobaric weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

#• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary _A Winter on Fire_ does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the EuroMajdan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

Then, Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, dropped a bombshell, saying sanctions would ""paralyze the assets of Russia’s central bank"" & ""freeze its transactions."" This sounds a lot like blocking sanctions—the strongest sanctions tool we have.

Now that the details are out, it looks like these are essentially blocking sanctions. (There are technical differences, but the effect is the same—""any transaction"" with the CBR is prohibited.) The CBR will be unable to intervene in FX markets to prop up the ruble, full stop.

The US directive also applies to Russia's National Wealth Fund and Ministry of Finance. Consequently, the action renders ALL of the Russian government's rainy day funds inert. It is comprehensive. (SOEs aren't included, but their FX holdings aren't nearly as large.)

This is a sanctions action without precedent. As a result, the specific consequences aren't easy to predict with a high level of confidence. But the consequences will certainly be far-reaching. And it took a whole lot of courage for the US and Europe to take this step.",False,1646131641.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,65,0,65,0,0,

This is an unprecedented event with many possible outcomes. I'll offer some predictions below. But first, how unprecedented is this?

We haven't seen the full-scale land invasion of a large industrial nation since WW2. And no nuclear superpower has ever been isolated this quickly and this completely from the rest of the world. That's before we even get into COVID, cyber warfare, social media, Putin's meddling in US domestic politics, or how quickly European countries are moving towards robust common defense policies that would have been unthinkable a year ago.

Now to Ukraine: things were completely up in the air in the first 5 days, but it looks like we're settling into a battle of attrition and atrocities, which really means it comes down to who blinks first:  
1) Putin, in which case we get some kind of peaceful resolution, and perhaps an uneasy, temporary return to the status quo ante.  
2) The Ukrainian defenses, in which case we get a Putin puppet regime facing an active insurgency for however long it takes.  
3) The Russian military & society, in which case Putin's in trouble.  
4) The rest of the world, in which case apathy takes over, Ukraine suffers, and Russia gradually slinks back from its pariah status through sheer Ukraine fatigue by western publics and politicians.

  
I genuinely can't say which of those 4 is likeliest, but obviously each one has very different implications for the kind of world we will live in this century, most notably for the Western alliance.",False,1646132795.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,61,0,61,0,0,

Because ive seen many people asking about it/confusing certain things repeatedly (no shame, its a lot of similar names and geopolitics is very complex and ever changing)

• EU (UE) - the European Union

The EU is a european political trading bloc consisting of 27 member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Louxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden)

The EU has a defensive mechanism where if one state is being attacked, other member states shall offer support

The current president of the EU (Commission) is Ursula Von der Leyen

• NATO - North Atlantic Treaty Organization

NATO is a defensive alliance between EU member states and the US, UK, Canada, Norway, Albania, Turkey, Iceland and Montenegro. 

EU member states who are NOT members of NATO are: Austria, Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Cyprus.

Important: NATO =/= EU. NATO has member states that are not part of the EU and vice versa.

The NATO defense mechanism Art 5 states, that an attack on one member, is considered to be an attack on all of NATO.

The current Secretary General of NATO is Jens Stoltenberg.

• PfP - Partnership for Peace

PfP is a NATO programe that aims to foster trust, co-operation and peace between member states and NATO. 

Current member states of PfP are: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.

EU member states that are part of PfP: Austria, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden

European Free Trade Association members that are also part of PfP: Switzerland

Cyprus is the only EU member that is neither a NATO member nor a PfP member.

• EFTA - European Free Trade Association

The EFTA is a free trade organization that is operating parallel to the EU and all members are part of the Schengen Area and participate in the european single market.

EFTA member states are not members of the EU.

Member states are: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland

• BRICS - Association of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa

The BRICS states are an association for 5 major emerging economies around the world. The aim is to deepen economic, political and cultural co-operation between the member states. 

In essence it is a light version of an inter-continental version of the EU. The BRICS states even have their own ""Central Bank"", the New Development Bank, which was founded to fund various projects in the member states 

Note: BRICS association could be one reason why countries like India or China have tried to remain relatively neutral in the Ukraine crisis

• CSTO - Collective Security Treaty Organization

The CSTO is a eurasian military alliance which consists of former soviet union states. It also aimes to deepen economic and political relations, however it is also important to note, that in the past there have been some serious clashes within the alliance - especially between Belarus and Russia, with most disputes revolving around economical issues.

Current members are: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan

Up until the Taliban takeover, Afghanistan had been granted observer status.

• UN - United Nations

The United Nations are an intergovernmental organization aiming to maintain global peace. Every sovereign state is a member of the UN (193) with the EU having an additional Observer Status. 

The current Secretary General of the UN is Antonio Guterres

• UNSC - United Nations Security Council

The Security council has the power to make binding decisions which UN member states have to carry out, since they have agreed to that by signing the UN Charta (Art 25). 

The UNSC consists of 15 members, of which 5 members are permanent members (The US, France, UK, China and Russia) - only the 5 permanent members have the power to Veto a UN resolution, and 10 non-permanent members (Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway, UAE) which are elected for two year terms by the UN assembly. 

The presidency of the UNSC rotates alphabetically between the member states every month:

Jan - Norway ; Feb - Russia ; March - UAE ; Apr - UK ; May - US ; June - Albania ; July - Brazil ; Aug - China ; Sept - France ; Oct - Gabon ; Nov - Ghana ; Dec - India

• DPR (DNR) and LPR (LNR) - Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic

Are two self-proclaimed breakaway Regions in eastern Ukraine which were officially recognised as independent states by Russia on Feb 21 in the prelude to this war.

Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, these two regions have been highly contested with russian-backed seperatists fighting against the Ukrainian government

• How do the financial sanctions on Russia actually work?

I saw this article being shared in a different thread and thought it layed out very well how the freezing of assets of the Russian Central Bank poses a real threat to Putin and Russia. 

I also recommend this read to people who feel like the sanctions have not been strong enough.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/how-russian-sanctions-work/622940/

• What are Thermoberatic weapons?

Thermoberatic or vacuum bombs use oxygen to generate an explosion. Conventional bombs consist of fuel and an oxidizer to charge the explosion, thermoberatic weapons however are fuel-air bombs, meaning they use almost 100% fuel and use the oxygen to create a more powerful explosion than conventional bombs do. 

For more in depth reading, here is an article from the Guardian explaining how thermoberatic weapons work:

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/what-are-thermobaric-weapons-and-how-do-they-work

• How did this situation devolve into this war/why is the EU offering candidate status now?

Imo, the documentary A Winter on Fire does a fantastic job of documenting Ukraine's fight for freedom, independence and a turn to the west - away from Russia. 

In this, you will see the outbreak of the EuroMajdan protests which eventually turned into a revolution which led to then president Yanukovich fleeing the country to russia which shortly after annexed Crimea.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4908644/

This aims to provide a short overview over these terms and maybe help understanding the differences - let me know if there is any other things i should add.

Feel free to copy, share or add to it - use it however you want.

 Russian trolls are trying the following :          
 1.Change the discussion to WW3/Nuclear warfare. Why ? So the people in the west get frightened and start complaining to their leaders to end this, which would make the west concede. Use your brain, Putin didnt threaten nuclear war to inform, but to frighten. Dont do his work for him.                   
 2.Sanctions dont do anything/the west isnt doing enough. As usual, diving a united society is the way to break it. See US politics. The west has its own sins,and LOOOOTS of them,but people trying to change the discussion to that, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, have ulterior motives.         

 While propaganda is rabid ON BOTH SIDES, remember what motives the people behind it, have. You are today not speaking german(unless youre german), because some people in 1945 chose to present the news in a certain way, which kept people`s minds at their tasks for the war effort, instead of at their fears. 
 Remember the worst is yet to come, those troll factories were working overtime just to install Trump. They arent on vacation, and the equivalent of a nuclear bomb, in the digital age of propaganda, is still in their arsenal. The dreaded ""false flag/kill your own civilians and blame the enemy"" method still hasnt popped up, AND IT WILL during the worst that is yet to come.               
  Remember Ukraine is being helped, and countries and corporations are hurting themselves just to help, ONLY because they want to associate themselves with something good. If Ukraine were to do something evil, like an assault on Russian land/civilans/infrastructure, it would make everyone turn on them and lose ALL support. In fact, the ONE thing Ukraine CANNOT do, is lose the PR war. Its what is keeping them alive. They know this, Putin knows this, the trolls know this. Do not help them when the moment comes.

> A lot of people have talked about the need to get inside Putin's mind, to try to understand the resentment, isolation, vindictive personality. But I wonder if we're missing something?
1/4

> Putin is indecisive. Unless the Russian army is profoundly incompetent, you have to conclude they lacked clear direction from the outset. So Putin must have failed to give clear orders. The Russian army hasn't been told what it's supposed to do. 2/4

> Putin is scared. The presence of Chechen fighters mixed in with regular forces suggests Putin doesn't trust his own military. Chechen leader Kadyrov ""listens only to Putin"". By bringing them into the mix, Putin's standing with his conventional commanders is further weakened. 3/4

> Has Putin stopped believing his own hype? Perhaps he doesn't think he can win this war, so he's in his bunker, refusing to give orders. It's not so much the risk of him lashing out, as the risk that his blundering army fights on, unsure whether and how to stop. 4/4

I understand that many of these are tanks but even still, a massive convoy of this size will be slowed significantly if they have to keep stopping to move around destroyed road (or move / destroy barricades in the way) and I'm sure some of the vehicles won't make it through.

* 1 protests become more and more visible on social medias
* 2 people that are anti war merge with the one that are anti putin and the one that want to save their economy.
* 3 there will be some occasion where the police will not arrest people/refuse order/resign. this will be the catalyst to more social unrest
* 4 opposition become more vocal and majority of the population side with them. part of the government stop working
* 5 sudden coup when putin is hiding in his bunker.

Yes the sanctions are having an economic impact on Russia. Whether that impact has any sway on Putin's actions is a completely different thing. Yes I hope they do, but if they don't and Putin keeps on, then what, do we just put Ukraine flags in our profile pics and say we tried. Yes There is a risk of nuclear escalation with Putin, but if we back down every time because of that, IMO Putin just takes more of what he wants until the rest of the world call him on his bluff. So I guess my question is, how many lives should be sacrificed before the bluff is called? That's not rhetorical, it could be that sanctions do work or it could be that they don't but Putin stops at Ukraine.

If they dont correct or acknowledge the ruling, both countries can be thrown out, if they persist to break democratic principles and doesnt cooperate. 

This illustrates the power of the European Commission - so a fast track of Ukraine's application to enter the EU is for certain possible.

Hope Putin has changed both Poland's and Hungary's perception, on basic democratic principles, from now on.

I also credit him and Merkel with thoroughly destroying Germany’s political landscape and subsequently for the rise of the right-wing AfD.

Schröder’s party was the Social Democratic Party, but Schröder was more of a centrist. So the party that was once the “left-wing-but-not-socialist-choice” for people became a centrist party under him.

After eight years of Schröder utterly demolishing the left side of the German political spectrum, Merkel was elected. Now, Merkel’s party, the CDU, was the Conservative party. The “right-wing-without-being-nazis-choice”. You know, healthy conservatism. However, just like Schröder, Merkel was very moderate, to the point of being a centrist. She too moved her party radically to the centre. SPD and CDU became almost indistinguishable. It pulled the even more conservative bavarian sister-party CSU a bit further to the left and created a big political vacuum on the right side of the CDU/CSU-Union. A vacuum that AfD filled. They then kept radicalising and are now just a bunch of populist Nazis in our parliament. 

But that entire thing, the two major parties becoming a centrist mess, that started with Schröder. That’s on him.

NATO is not part of a call of duty campaign, they can’t just go in guns blazing and firing freedom bullets/bombs everywhere. NATO is literally doing everything in their power to support Ukraine right now. These fantasy scenarios are exactly that.

Also, believe it or not, Reddit’s demographic skews young, I’m talking teenagers here ok. Teens are not the most rational people. They get anxious, they get pessimistic, they get scared, they think everything is an earth shattering event. This is normal human behavior/emotion. Stop calling everyone you disagree with a Russian bot/troll for expressing these common human emotions. It’s annoying, intentionally derails any conversation, and just antagonizes/divides people. Not everything is propaganda. Obviously if someone is saying pro-Russian shit or deliberately missing the point, call them out but not everyone is informed on what’s happening, some people are new to the conversation so questions that may seem obvious to you may not be obvious to everybody (tho I will say google will probably give you better answers for certain questions than Redditors)

This is not because it's a war crime, or because civilians got killed, or anything like that.

It's because it was a half-assed pinprick on a militarily unimportant target that never the less used up scarce Russian military resources.

An actual MOU - to use Russian military jargon for a front massed fire strike - wouldn't just have damaged the building, it would have flattened it, and most of the square kilometer around the building, making it really clear to Ukrainian defenders that continued resistance leads only to death.

Instead, we get this half-assed little single missile strike that is seemingly designed to show the Russian army is continuing to be busy and is definitely doing damage. It's the sort of attack that's designed to get fifteen seconds of good video for a presentation.

Russia also made a huge organizational change to their military back in the late 00's and as of 2017 their career soldiers out umber conscripts. There has been a large cultural issue between the two groups. Going back to 2014 and up to present day, soldiers fighting along the Ukraine border have always been looked down upon by others in the force. It was one of these places you didn't want to be sent to. They lacked training, equipment, and have always suffered from low morale.

I wonder if Putin offered conscripts near the front line some sort of ""bonus"" or legally bounding incentive that out them on contract so he could send more in on the front line.

1. He sees them as expendable/undertrained, but possibly enough of a force to takeover and control Ukraine.

Like most disinformation, there is a grain of truth. There was a verbal agreement and the US/NATO broke it. The US has also moved our interceptors closer to Russia as more countries joined. 

However, NATO is a defensive alliance, not offensive. If Russia doesn't attack a NATO country, NATO won't hit back. If Russia wasn't threatening its neighbors, they would not feel the need to join NATO.

From all the reliable information we have had so far it's safe to say that Putin's plan was to do a quick and clean Blitzkrieg-style attack. He wanted to take over Kyiv, force a surrender (therefore stopping the attacks) and then start the ""peace talk"", which would lead to them putting a puppet to rule Ukraine. This would be the ideal scenario because damage and loss of life would be minimal so the west wouldn't be so angry at them, also sanctions wouldn't be so harsh, and would likely be progressively lifted as the peace talk progressed.

However, this plan failed because the Ukrainians showed way more resistance than the Russians expected. They couldn't finish it as quickly as they wanted, and because the Ukrainians are holding the line, the Russians need to press harder, causing more destruction and deaths than they initially planned, which in turn led to more sanctions from the West, way more than they expected.

So now even if Russia wins the battle and takes over Ukraine (which will likely eventually happen), they have completely shattered their relationship with the West, caused damage so big in their economy that it will likely take over a decade to recover (if it doesn't get worse from here) and sparked a lot of domestic anger against Putin and the government.

So yeah, Putin thought he could do it quick enough and finish before the heavy sanctions came in, so he would eventually be able to get away with it like he did get away with Crimea, and to be honest, this would probably have worked.  But that failed and the whole thing was a fiasco, even if they win the battle now.

Backing out now would probably make him look even worse, so he will likely keep pushing until he eventually wins the battle, so he can at least say it wasn't for nothing.

Story Time, if someone is bored and want to read it:   


Back in 2016 I and 3 friends did a road trip from Coast to Coast in the US. Starting from Miami we drove overnight and arrived in New Orleans early next morning, we were hungry and there weren't many places open so when we saw a KFC just opening we stopped there to eat. One of my friends collects sports jerseys, and on the occasion he was, coincidentally, wearing the Ukraine's national team jersey. While we were eating, another guy came in, ordered something and sat there to eat as well. Then he heard us talking in a different language and came to our table, it went like that:  


He: Are you guys fucking Russians?!  
Friend: No, we are not  
He: Why the hell are you speaking Russian then?!  
Friend: We are not, it doesn't even sound like Russian, bro!  
He: So why is he wearing a fucking tee with Russian writing then?!  
Friend: It's not Russian, it's Ukrainian, look at the colors, it's yellow and blue, Russia is blue, red and white!  
He: You sure about that? Why you wearing that shit anyway? You're in America!  
Friend: It was a gift, it's from a soccer team, I collect jerseys and didn't know it was a bad idea to wear it here in America.  
He: Ok then, but you should take it off soon, we don't like Russians here and the next guy might not be as nice as I am and ask before beating that shit out of you.  


Friend: Thanks for the tip, bro, I'll change it after I'm done eating.  


We managed to keep it cool, but it was pretty scary. We were 3 guys and one girl, but the guy was much taller and stronger than us, plus we didn't know if had a gun or knife so we didn't want to upset him and played it nice.  


My friend of course took it off as soon as we got back to the car and never wore it again during the next 25 days we stayed in America. I don't know if this guy was just an asshole, if this was a ""gang thing"" or if people there really don't like Russians, but if they go through something similar often, I feel sorry for them, must be tough.",False,1646133765.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,14,0,14,0,0,

Russian troops get hold of Zelenskyy and relpace him and his cabinet by someone else to asert control. Seems very unlikely tbf. Zelenskyy is too popular and making him a martyr will add to the ukrainian fighting spirit.

The russian army has held back for now. Large Grozny-style bombardments have not happened on a large scale (eventhough they are intensifying now). Using excessive force against the Ukrainian people will not help with controlling the country afterwards.  Don't see how this could be a sound strategy.

  
Russia comes to an agreement with Ukraine. Most likely this will result in the partition of the country. They will force this agreement by intensifying their attack on the cities. Splitting up Ukraine is the only way they may be able to keep control of the country. After this they would sit on the table with the West to talk about the gradual removal of the sanctions. This seems to me - speaking as an armchair general and politician- as being the most likely outcome.",False,1646128445.0,t3_t43bke,t3_t43bke,,0,1,0,1,0,0,

But the one thing really bugging me is the overall tone in response to this from not only the US but NATO as a whole. How is Putin not a dead man walking? How is someone allowed to do this in the name of military exercise not only to the country they’re invading but their own people as well. How can a world exist where he succeeds, conquers Ukraine and then what? We all are supposed to forgive the war crimes that have been committed? 

Also, on a broader scale. Why is Putin not being referred to as a terrorist? How are these not acts of terror? News outlets like the BBC still refer to him as “President Putin” as if he is deserving of any respect whatsoever. Just the entire tone seems to be way too accepting of the situation.

dc4311272815ce638afa23482cbaad95,t43bke,hywftf1,"Doing IED’s is a skill. Many of them in Iraq began as artillery shells.  Empty abandoned military warehouses were raided by disgruntled unemployed ex-military residents of Iraq. President Bush famously disbanded the Iraqi army leaving trained people unemployed without supervision. 

In Ukraine The government is handing out firearms and instructions for making Molotov cocktails.   There are not a lot of abandoned military warehouses yet. There probably won’t be.  

A large quality of explosive is required especially if the target is a tank.  In Iraq, targets were originally Humvees without any armament, especially underneath.   The explosive device must be triggered somehow.  So there must be a trigger installed.   That would have to be activated.  So imagine wires leading between the observation post and the device.  Or a more advanced set up would be wireless, A modified cell phone. 

To counter IED‘s, cell phone blockers would be mounted on Humvees.  Special vehicles were manufactured with special shapes to reduce the impact of an IED. 

No one in Ukraine actually expected Putin to invade until the last month. If they had, then the expected invasion routes would have been mined. The minds would’ve had to be monitored and switched because regular roads are being used for invasion.  By switched, I mean mine planted in the road which can be switched on.

Things changed when Pakistan was found to have been protecting Bin Laden, due to which Pakistan lost US support…

US started forming relations with India then and India had to walk the fine line between US & Russia so as to not antagonise an old ally (Russia) … who is also one of the largest arms supplier to India and having sided with India historically and strategically.

Now with China trying to eat in to India’s borders, Russia has became more important to India because it is the only country who would put some pressure on China to back off…

So with Russia being a key ally for India against Pakistan and to a certain extent China… India cannot afford to cut ties and openly condemn Russia…

Even more so, as (and I don’t mean to be a troll about this) India clearly sees that in a time of actual conflict, the US did not really provide Ukraine any military support (I mean send their troops)… it is left to fight on its own (Yes they are doing a great job with the sanctions and providing arms and support), but it is clear that the US doesn’t want to fight other peoples battles for them so India understands that in case Pakistan or China (who btw have now joined forces to attack India on either side routinely), US WILL not fight a battle for India but there is a possibility that Russia might help in some way (due to history)…

So it is in India’a best interest now to be quiet about Russia…

Now why Indians are supporting them is because the government can see that the entire world is condemning Russia and they need to spin a narrative to defend their stance, due to which State run TV channels provide fake news and one sided stories to form a narrative they want… and Indians are falling for it…

Depends.

Brexit showed that the EU can form a united front and is willing to do quite a bit to maintain that.

[~110.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) civilians in Iraq, with total excess deaths between 400.000 and 1.100.000.

Current Ukrainian claims are [~350](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) civilians dead as reference. That's a lot for this early in, but not in the grand scheme of things.

The 2014 revolution happened because the then government turned away from the eu and chose closer ties with Russia. Among those who fought on the anti-Russian side were ultranationalists. They were important in the revolution but polled at near-zero in subsequent elections.

Regardless, Putin has used them as a casus belli. Of course he doesn't care that they are far-right. He cares that they are anti-Russia. It does seem that he was expecting a much warmer reception from the Ukrainian public upon the arrival of the Russian army, I think he believed that the influence of the ultranationalists was far far bigger than it actually is.

If he considers Ukraine a part of Russia and can see it turning its back on Moscow and looking towards Brussels, trying to join the EU and NATO - which he sees as designed to rival and threaten Russia respectively - that for him is a red line and explains his decision to go to war to bring Ukraine back 'home'.

This failed completely and they lost the battles to secure the airport and bring troops there but they got chernobyl.

This failure meant that the tactic failed and the troops they had taking over small cities in south/east had no supply lines and made little sense.

Ukraine is getting a lot of supplies but we do not know what state the professional army is in. 
Did they just retreat in east/south or take big losses there.

Most likely solution is a political one with ukraine getting political support and Russia having upperhand military wise.

Thats the sad truth. Russia would not behave like this (they have been enormously stupid throughout this but I doubt they would be THAT stupid) if they weren't confident that the Ukrainians can do fuck all about it.

One reason we all have been rallying behind Ukraine was because it has the feel of David vs. Goliath and that it early looked like David might actually be able to pull it off.

But between all the losses in the South (where it looks like the Russians have taken everything but a few cities) and this convoy, the outlook is very, very bleak. The Ukrainians might be able to turn this into one of the ugliest meatgrinders we have seen since Stalingrad and make Putin pay an incredibly high cost in lives lost, material lost and all that comes with that (unrest at home, sanctions, insane financial costs) but from the looks of it it isn't even sure if that would ever force Putin to pull back.

Putin encircles Kiev and other cities and lays siege for weeks, making it impossible for Ukraine to resupply food or ammo, by simply waiting.

Hope is good for people, and we should hope each day brings about relief for Ukrainians who deserve the ability to decide their own fate, just as the Kremlin chooses its fate.

hope is not a plan. The current course of events makes for a clear outcome: the Kremlin is willing to harm the world to impose its will.  It is also willing to talk to minimize the costs of imposing its will on others. 

The allied nations that the Kremlin has identified as its foes have many options, and many of those options due not involve conflict.    Note that the best of the bad options is still bad, and selecting nothing is an option itself. 

Encouragingly the world is reacting right now with a healing mindset.  There is hope that the Kremlin turns its course away from a net negative.  The US, for example, isn’t “there”.

In Russia, all boys after finishing school must serve in the army for 1 year unless they have some medical conditions or they manage to get into the university.

As you can imagine, this accumulates less witty individuals in Russian army.
This, plus trend to promote people based on how loyal they are instead of how good they are at their job creates systemic incompetence.

When military superior ask his subordinate to, count the amount of working tanks he responsible for, he will answer ""ALL OF THEM!"" without even thinking, because otherwise he will be in trouble. Now this superior, feeling good with himself, will go to his superior and report that 250 tanks are ready and in shining condition, despite the base only having 200 tanks nominally, and only half of them in a decent order. This goes up and up untill it get to the tops where whey think they wield the second best military in the world.

Similar goes with the orders. General orders 20k troops on the border until February, and as this order goes down, the amount of troops increases because superiors wants to outdo each other and get promotions.

First of all, I think it is important that you stop doomscrolling as much, I fucked my mental health over the past few days and had to take an entire two days to reset everything and get back to somewhere manageable. I've dealt with it for so long I now recognize when I'm in decline pretty fast. In general you need to avoid depressing subs and news subs. Focus in subs that only help you.

Second you need to ease up on the Crypto, it looks like you are not in a good place mentally to be doing trades that frequently. The best investment early on is to invest in yourself and increase your earning power, so that you have expendable money to work with. You probably should not be working with crypto for now if you need food stamps. I did similar and it was awful having my anxiety ride the market.

Stuff takes time. If you enjoy reading I recommend ""You can't afford the luxury of a negative thought"" and ""The Slight Edge"". Go through those books and pick out a couple concepts and ideas that resonate as you read them (mark everything that resonates on your first read through). Try them out for a couple months, reassess and then go through some others that resonated.

You will eventually get to a solid baseline, which is where I am after four years (31 now). From there you work on increasing your earnings and deciding what you want to do. Your apparent fluency in Mandarin(?) is a massive advantage if you ever want to start a business once war and Covid fuck off, but first you must invest in yourself.

I wont reply as I simply don't have the attention or capacity to keep up and mentor a random stranger on the net without it being detrimental to myself. I hope one day I reach a point where I am able to help others properly without imploding myself, but a one and done block of advice is the best I can do for now.

putin can very easily just decide to replay yesterday and basically just drop those oxygen bombs all across kiev or whatever else he has in his arsenal.

8f281b5cf17e7dc7b06e29ef92ad6d35,t43bke,hyw9giy,"Here's my uninformed opinion on the matter:

Russia thought that the massed forces and supplies would be sufficient to break through the Ukrainian positions, and blitz their way with little resistance across the country. They probably also thought they would be welcomed, or at least not utterly despised by the civilian population.

Therefore, they had enough material and supplies for a few days of shock and awe, and pushing through. It's important to note that mechanized divisions can move 100s of KM in a day, and should have overrun the country by now.

To back this up, I point to the constant throwing away of elite paratrooper units on the airport at Kyiv. The goal was not to sacrifice them to the skull throne of our lord and savior Khorne, but they thought that they would be relieved quickly by armored columns arriving at the outskirts of Kyiv within hours.

So they didn't throw poor quality troops. They threw what they had amassed at Ukraine.

When the breakthroughs failed to materialize, the wheels immediately started to come off. First off, they failed to achieve aerial superiority, which meant that they armored and mechanized units were now sitting ducks, forcing them to stop or risk being picked off. Secondly, their supplies were only sufficient for a few days of movement and light fighting, and they started to run out. Thirdly, the troops were not ready to get a bloody nose, shooting morale down.

The next punch that Russia takes will be far slower, more methodical, and rely on its overwhelming superiority of numbers of heavy artillery, tanks, and other heavy weapon systems. They seem to have abandonned any hope for a quick breakthrough, and so I suspect we'll see massive shelling campaigns, barrages, bombing raids, and whatever missiles they have left being smashed into Ukrainian positions.",False,1646129726.0,t3_t43bke,t1_hyw6rot,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Putin doesn't admit defeat or show weakness, instead he'll double down repeatedly until he gets something he can spin as a win.

Looking at his relationship with Belarus it is clear he wants to re-establish Moscow's control over former soviet states where possible. Ukraine looked possible. In 2008 a pro-EU president faced off against Putin's favoured puppet and Ukraine began to slip away. Everything since then has been move and countermove in trying to bring Ukraine back under Moscow control. The motive is nationalism, nostalgia and yes, money. But it is part of a broader idea of carving out a ""sphere of influence"" which the US recognises as Moscow's just like the 2nd world once was.

He foresaw sanctions but calculated that they'd be modest. Remember that they nearly were. Over the weekend the SWIFT sanctions went from opposed by Germany, Italy, Cyprus and therefore the EU to being agreed. This happened because of Ukrainian pressure. If Zelensky was killed and the military operation concluded as quickly as planned they never would have occurred.

All winter the Russians were sending the bare contractual minimum of gas to the EU and ignoring high market prices. Why? Well, this is why. At first it was conceivable that the EU (led by Germany) would rather just look the other way while Russia quickly conquered Ukraine than stop buying gas. Stockpiles are low (thanks to Putin's preparations) and prices already high (thanks to Putin's preparations).

The key miscalculation was Ukrainian resistance. If the conquest had been swift, even if few other governments believed that a spontaneous uprising had been made safe by Russian peacekeepers looking to prevent genocide, so long as 48hrs later it was over and done the world could shrug.

But with people all over the western world falling in love with Zelensky and the fate of Ukraine hanging in the balance there is a strong push for aid and sanctions even on reluctant national governments.

This isn't what Putin planned, what he was assured would happen. But now he is facing down an unappealing choice between a quagmire in Ukraine under economic sanctions that really ruin his economy or failing in the most public way possible and looking weak in a mafia state where the weak are robbed and killed.

They do not export a lot outside of natural resources and they have no tech, manufacturing, or proprietary products to give them a strategic advantage.

All of their international assets are seized so they are completely hamstrung as to what they can do financially.

They would literally have to physically deliver it and accept cash or barter it. 

The interest rate just doubled overnight. Right now you could buy a Russian bond at a 20% interest rate or a US bond at a 0.5% interest rate. The US bond will probably significantly outperform the Russian one.

They're advancing from the south from what we can see and we expect Mariupol to be sieged soon but that's it for now.  

You forgot one thing to address couple of things:

1) Ukraine is receiving intelligence from most powerful intelligence agencies in the world right now. 

2) For 1 defender there needs to be at least 4-5 attackers especially in Urban warfare. Russia simply doesn't have the numbers to hold those cities.  
  
3) They're receiving a lot of high tech weaponry from NATO and allies and combined with intel it allows them to wreck Russians even when in inferior numbers.  They know the terrain a lot better because it's their land.  
  
4) Low morale of Russian troops which we can already observe. Abandoning vehicles, empty base near Sumy is showing that they're not truly dedicated to fight. Demoralized army is the worst army.

Action speaks louder than words. No reason is important enough to kill the innocent and civilians, unless you have received equal scale of violence. Did Ukraine do anything to the scale of what Russia has done to them?

Since 1648 we have lived in a world where leaders of sovereign nation-states theoretically get to make their own decisions. Of course, Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state, but since WW2 we have also lived in a world where nuclear powers are de facto exempted from the normal rules, for better or worse, which is often bad news for non-nuclear powers. Ukraine had nukes after USSR fell and gave them to Russia in good faith, which is an obvious irony here. More directly to your question, Putin is a new kind of authoritarian, who has cleverly played on the Russian psyche traumatized by the instability of the 90s. The deal was: I give you law and order and a functioning economy, and you don't question my rule. All that worked as long as there was order and a functioning economy. The crazy part (which might re-establish the moral imperatives that underline your question -- right and wrong) is that Putin has, for the first time, utterly failed to hold up his end of the bargain (order, and a functioning economy).

The US credit card company did not specify which institutions it had restricted but said it would continue to work with regulators.

Kyrylo Shevchenko, governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, told Nikkei Asia on Monday that the central bank had urged Mastercard and Visa to halt transactions of their credit and debit cards issued by Russian banks.

Michael Miebach, Mastercard’s chief executive, said the company was on a heightened alert against cyber attacks.

“Our cyber and intelligence and corporate security teams are working with governments and partners around the world to ensure the stability, integrity and resiliency of our systems, which are operating as normal,” he said in a statement.

“We are committed to active monitoring and rapid response to cyber-attacks, the threat of which is heightened significantly in the present environment.”

Mastercard also pledged to contribute $2mn for humanitarian relief for Ukraine. “The invasion by Russian military forces over the past week has been devastating for the people of Ukraine,” Miebach said.

Look, all I'm saying is that India has it's own border issues.

We have been looking out for us on our own.

We know that ukraine is in the right here.

We know that aligning with any country would be compromising our border safety.

We also know that we'll be alone in our fight if something like this happens. Our only hope is India being a nuclear power.


On a side note, Ukraine has voted against everything India has stood for in the UN, and asking for help and expecting  a yes is quite illogical.


We have been forced to sacrifice enough over the centuries. Especially for wars in Europe. We've had enough. We've spilled the blood. You can't ask for more.

Even when a good chunk of the population do support the dicatorship's horrors, it's also to be understood that it is difficult to stay clear and clean when oyu're inside. Propaganda isn't something easy to protect yourself from (Anyone saying so probably just doesn't even understand what propagandas he blindly believes in), and with time it becomes harder and harder because thoses who succub to it becomes new source of propagation for it, as well as social pressure, youngsters get involved and grow up into adults that only endorse because they've never been told how wrong it all is and were never raised to understand it. Plus, out of thoses who grew into people not rotten by the propaganda, openly protesting is much more difficult.

Technically yes, they're accountable, but it's important to understand that and try to help them more than to beat on them, first of because we're better than that, second because really no one is safe from that, being at a large or small scale, it takes very little to start the echo chamber.

>MUTUAL DEFENCE CLAUSE

>The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the solidarity between EU countries in dealing with external threats by introducing a mutual defence clause (Article  42(7) of the Treaty on European Union). This clause provides that if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it **by all the means in their power**, in accordance with Article  51 of the United Nations Charter.

>This obligation of mutual defence is binding on all EU countries. However, it does not affect the neutrality of certain EU countries and is consistent with the commitments of EU countries which are NATO members.

>This provision is supplemented by the solidarity clause (Article  222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU) which provides that EU countries are obliged to act jointly where an EU country is the victim of a terrorist attack or a natural or man-made disaster.

He can't.

Russia's power in the world comes from the perception of their power. Their nukes aren't a REAL bargaining chip, all they do is just mean nobody can invade Russia. But if Russia pulls back in Ukraine, they show the world that what everyone thought until this week was a third rate military can beat the much vaunted Russian Juggernaut. Not to mention basically every nation to Russia's west, sans Belarus, is probably going to join NATO now to ensure that Russia can never offensively attack again, it basically means that Russia is done for.

Their economy has been entirely relying on the sale of fossil fuels for decades, with their various other industries sort of limping along. With corruption so rampant that multi-billion rubel projects, like their new space launch center, are losing ~40% of the funding to corruption and graft, they've been in a slow economic death spiral.

In a very real sense, this situation is a last hurrah to try and reforge the Soviet Union and the old glory days.

And the problem Putin has, is that even if Ukraine surrendered right this second, NATO now solidly is aware that Russia's conventional armed forces are lacking in the extreme. Unless he immediately pivoted to invade several other nations that are likely now going to seek NATO membership, he'll have definitely lost his chance anyway.

The only reason why I'm writing something here at all and I left the ""read only"" mode is that some people here, foreigners, started asking me how it looks, feels when you were born in Ukraine, in a Russian-Ukrainian family, when you have relatives in Kiev, relatives in Moscow, and geographically was born in Donetsk and spent childhood in city which is the source of all problems. Also I’m historical, so I really like to compare the facts, making some analysis. My own dissertation in uni was about Soviet 60’ dissident movement: it’s truly the hidden treasure of controversial facts and blind spots.

In the process of reading many news, I have been discovering inconsistencies for several days. And they outrage me. I see a huge amount of frankly clumsy propaganda from both sides, news about which no one does fact-checking, they just look at what is happening as if it's a Hollywood movie, where all Germans are necessarily dirty sick bastards, and allies poop a rainbow. I have already written here, and I repeat once again, no one in Russia and Belarus wanted to start this war. No one except specific politicians pursuing their dirty and mercantile goals. 

And yes, I openly admit that I want war crimes to be condemned. Convicted by a court, democratic, fair and honest. And I really believe that in a situation of general panic, fear, lack of objective information on both sides of the conflict — at such moments, the assholes (all of them: Russians, Ukrainians, Chechens, Belarusians, even maybe any of foreigners) have their hands untied. This is how rapists, looters, bastards appear, using the crisis in order to achieve their mercantile goals.

The reason why this is a dangerous and destabilising lime of thinking is that it can lead to contested regions and conflict. There are ways to transfer land and people that don't involve war, and as soon as you intervene militarily you delegitimise the whole affair in a way that makes it hard to maintain peace, and actually often is only counter productive. Rather than liberating the people of Crimea, what Russia has done is ensure that there can be no easy path to stability in the region.

>As does fighting your own people to keep them in your 'state' against their will...

Perhaps. But that didn't happen. Ukraine fought a war against Russia when they invaded.

>Because the canal and the water rights were there since before modern Russia or modern Ukraine existed. For the same reason Turkey doesn't cut off water to Syria.

Actually, it kind of does. Turkey has been reducing the water downriver. That wouldn't make it right, but it's worth noting that you're acting under an incorrect assumption. This is hardly limited to that region either: the US has also been causing rivers into Mexico to dwindle.

But importantly, what does make this different is that a river is not a canal. It's not a natural resource, and is more akin to other manmade resources. Ukraine also wouldn't want to supply electricity or gas into the contested region. Again, this falls on Russia for ensuring that there could be no reasonable negotiation.

>Depends on if you sympathize with Crimea or mainland Ukraine I suppose.

It doesn't because Russia changed the game by invading. It's not only possible but completely reasonable to support Crimean integration into Russia but recognising that annexation was utterly wrong.

>Does Syria pay Turkey for the Euphrates?

No, but as I've mentioned Turkey does reduce the supply of water into other countries. So this isn't a very supportive argument.

>I blame them for the atrocities they commit, and I blame Ukraine for the atrocities they commit. Rarely is anyone completely innocent in war, or in the events leading up to it. Something you might do well to learn.

There is no comparison here. Russia is the aggressor, Russia is the state that invaded, Russia is breaking international law, and Russia is killing Ukrainian civilians.

Crimea was the only region of Ukraine with a majority ethnic Russian population. The 2001 census recorded 58 per cent of the population of Crimea, including Sevastopol, as ethnic Russian, and 24 per cent as ethnic Ukrainians.

The 1996 USIA/SOCIS-Gallup survey showed that 59 per cent of ethnic Russians in Crimea supported their region joining Russia.

The 2001 Razumkov Center survey showed that 50 per cent of the respondents in Crimea favoured their region becoming a part of Russia, and an additional 9 per cent preferred to see their region as an independent state.

The separatist preferences in Crimea increased significantly after the ‘Orange Revolution’ in 2004 brought a pro-Western and nationalist president, Viktor Yushchenko, to power. In the 2008 Razumkov Center survey, conducted soon after the Russian-Georgian war following an attempt by the Georgian government to seize the de-facto independent secessionist region of South Ossetia, 73 per cent of the Crimeans, who made their minds on this issue, backed the secession of Crimea from Ukraine with a goal of joining Russia (calculated from AR Krym, 2008). In this survey, 85 per cent of ethnic Russians, 65 per cent of ethnic Ukrainians, and 17 per cent of the Crimean Tatars wanted their region to secede from Ukraine.

The official results of the referendum held on 16 March 2014 reported that 97 per cent of the voters in Crimea supported joining Russia.

Even if you dispute the 2014 referendum, prior to that you were seeing 70-80% approval, and I'd hardly say there was much reason to suggest a russian op back in the early 2000s, especially as Putin, prior to the overthrow of the Yanukovych government in February 2014, did not support separatism in Crimea.

Also, FIFA, one of the world's most corrupt sport federation, the one that puts a blind eye towards slavery in Qatar is now acting as bastion of purity. They were very happy to continue their football matches when Crimea was being invaded. Every single corporation in the world was like ""yeah, it is just a local conflict"" back then.

So, trust me, I don't remember any difference between that and today. Other than everyone in west suddenly becoming paragon of peace. 

Btw, 8 years is not too long in world politics. I mean, we still have reservations about Germany for world war 2, right? We still have reservations for Saudis for 9/11, right? So, ""it was long ago"" isn't really a thing. 

See, I know what I am trying to do might come across as ""trying to sow seeds of conspiracy"". And to be frank, that's what I am doing. My conspiracy theory is just that ""Crimea was not different, but now everyone suddenly cares, something is not right"". What's that ""something"", I don't know. Maybe it is nothing. Maybe it is just that this is second time, so world is more frustrated with it. Maybe it is just that Trump and Boris caused people to hate Russia more. Maybe it is a way to justify someone going for a coup in Russia. Maybe it is to justify getting Crimea back by crippling Russia till they play nice. Maybe it is a justification to start world war 3. I don't know. All I know is that something is off. That Crimea was same situation but no one cared then. 

And if that makes me be considered as a paid bot or conspiracy nutter like those flat earthers, so be it. I am just not looking forward to people using this invasion as a justification for nuclear war. And somehow, that's what every country, every corporation seems to be building towards. It is not like Putin will stop being senile due to the sanctions. Most likely, he will retaliate by using nukes, and then, welll, that's it. Say goodbye to humanity. So, you can understand why I am not feeling at ease with the extreme level of retaliation or the whole ""omg, Russia bad"" thing.

What the fuck are you talking about? It involves 3 states right now. *per definition* it requires the involvement of a significant amount of states all over the world.

No, heavy sanctions is not the same as waging war. North Korea is not at war with the USA, neither is Iran, nor Cuba, nor Venezuela, nor was the entire world at war with South Africa over the Apartheid sanctions.

Also it is definitely not all of the world. China largely remains neutral, so has India, so has Brazil. Most African, south american and Asian states are largely not getting involved. Not even to mention Russia's allies who are definitely not siding vs Russia. It's the western countries that stand united against Russia, but then again, that was always the case to some extent. Now just more so than before. Get out of your western bubble. The entire world isn't Europe + 3 asian states + The USA and Canada.
