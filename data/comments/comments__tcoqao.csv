Day 17 of my updates from Kharkiv, my previous post can be found at the link above.

Today it was actually really quiet and uneventful, which is good, but rarely there are still some sounds of explosions and shots being fired. And at this point it‚Äôs weirder when everything is quiet, weird but good; it would be nice if every day was like this.

Actually while it is quiet there are still air raid alerts almost every hour of the day, there‚Äôs one going on right now, but we haven‚Äôt heard any aircrafts in almost a week, or maybe it was just so far away that it didn‚Äôt sound like one, there are some weird sounds in the air almost constantly, they might be coming from missiles but we are not sure, they sure don‚Äôt sound like one of the planes that sometimes fly over our building.

Please keep in mind that there's an enormous amount of misinformation flowing about, and that in times like these even things presented by traditional media as fact may be found out to be false later.

If true, it would also mean that Russian forces east of Volnovakha would have some of their supply lines cut

üëâüÜï Ukraine's Security Services SBU report that intercepted phone calls supposedly show Russian troops near Kharkiv were ordered to shoot at civilians, including children

üëâüÜï Chernihiv's exhausted-looking Governor reported from in front of the ruins of the city's Ukraine Hotel and said, while wiping tears from his eyes, that ""There is no such hotel any more, but Ukraine itself still exists and it will prevail""

üëâüÜï More reports of civilian deaths amid evacuation efforts yesterday as a humanitarian convoy of mostly women and children was fired upon by Russian forces killing 7 people, one of which was a child. This was reported today by Ukrainian military intelligence, noting that they do not know the exact number of injured as the remnants of the convoy were forced to retreat back to the village of Peremoha by Russian troops. One witness from the convoy say the cars were marked with signs saying children were inside

üëâüÜï Ukraine's state operated nuclear energy company Energoatom says in a press release that 11 Russian engineers have arrived to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia to relieve the Ukrainian staff that has been effectively forced to work at gunpoint. A representative of the Russian group now says the plant belongs to Russian state company Rosatom

**Politics/Diplomacy**

üëâüÜï Russian military officials say situation in some Ukrainian cities ""catastrophic"". They also claim Ukrainian Army has dropped phosphorus bombs on Popasna south of Severodonetsk near the Donbass front lines which could indicate a Russian attempt at arranging a ""false flag"" attack allowing them to escalate with chemical weapons of their own

üëâüÜï The Biden administration's previously announced Task Force KleptoCapture will not just target oligarchs but also those ""who have assisted the regime responsible for the invasion of Ukraine""

üëâüÜï Heads of states of British led Joint Expeditionary Task force to meet in London tomorrow

üëâüÜï Ukraine's Foreign Minister says Russia is trying to create a logistics base in Chernobyl and that Belarus is unlikely to commit troops. He also does not hold out much hope for a negotiated settlement with Russia but that they are willing to negotiate further, but not surrender

üëâüÜï Croatian PM states disappointment with EU and NATO's slow reaction to the drone that crashed in Zagreb yesterday. Initial reports from Croatia itself stated the drone was likely Russian, but as Ukraine also operates that type of drones (Tu-141), it may well have been an Ukrainian drone

1. They have an extremely wide area of effect. 

2. They consistently leave behind a large number of unexploded ordinances. The ordinances can remain in a given area for decades and they may still be live. Basically, they may function as land mines.


Notable past instances of usage:

1995 Shali cluster bomb attack - Russian fighter jets dropped 18 cluster bombs in the Chechen town of Shali. Locations struck included a market, a gas station and  a hospital. Over 100 civilians killed.

> 2003‚Äì2006: United States and allies attacked Iraq with 13,000 cluster munitions, containing two million submunitions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to the HRW. At multiple times, coalition forces used cluster munitions in residential areas, and the country remains among the most contaminated to this day, bomblets posing a threat to both US military personnel in the area, and local civilians.
> 
> When these weapons were fired on Baghdad on 7 April 2003 many of the bomblets failed to explode on impact. Afterward, some of them exploded when touched by civilians. USA Today reported that ""the Pentagon presented a misleading picture during the war of the extent to which cluster weapons were being used and of the civilian casualties they were causing."" On 26 April, General Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the US had caused only one civilian casualty.

Ukraine's military has (or had) around 170k active troops and 100k reservists.  In addition another 100k or so territorial defense force members consisting largely of veterans bring their total of potential military combatants and support personnel to just under 400k.  This is one of the largest militaries in Europe and as it is demonstrating, they are well trained.  The number of them actually experienced in warfare isn't going to be close to that total though; modern militaries contain a lot of non-combatant members like medics, technicians, mechanics, and so on.  They can fight if they have to, but that's not their job.     
  
Russia's total troop buildup in and around Ukraine has been estimated to be just shy of 200k troops at the highest possible estimates.  It has been reported over the past couple weeks that upwards of 90% of that force is now engaged in the fight.  
  
The misconception I am seeing is that some of you seem to think that this almost-200k force is the totality of Russia's ground forces.  That they've moved their entire army into Ukraine for this fight.  You're reading ""90% engaged"" as 90% of Russia's total military force, not 90% of the troops they built up at the Ukrainian border.  Russia has the fifth largest military in the world.  Their active duty troops are around 1 million and they have around 2 million reservists.  They have plenty more bodies to throw at this conflict if they need to.  They aren't remotely close to fully engaged and have more than enough troops to go into other countries at the same time as continuing to fight in Ukraine if Putin wants.

Ukraine's winning the social media war, but losing on the battlefield. The final note still bears some hope.

**For Russia:**

(The pure military aspect)

* They don't need to hurry; they can spend months. Need two weeks to scrape up some reserves or resources? Ok, wait two weeks, no problems.
* Basic strategy 1: Encircle all cities first. No need to hurry to capture them, just make sure the inhabitants don't get support or supplies. Then move forces to one city (Kyiv first) and finish it before doing next. Cut electricity, water, medicine, food. Starve them and shell them. Wait them out.
* Basic strategy 2: Deal with Ukraine's main army. UA army around 100,000 soldiers + tanks and other vehicles; located in the East due to Donbas crisis. Encircle as much as possible.
* Pinchers. Two main routes: Mariupol - Donetsk - Kramatorsk - Kharkiv, and Melitopol - Zaporizhia - Dnipro - Kharkiv. Only need to capture 250 km more inwards and a pincher locks. Then UA army can't get out to the west. 
* UA army pulling back to the west extremely vulnerable to air attacks in the steppe landscape.

**Against Russia:**

In pure terms of military they can win, BUT:

* Russian army has unbelieveable levels of suck. Strategy holds (encircling, shelling, pincers) and progress is made, but army leadership disastrous. NATO officers and NCOs in Russia's place would win this easily.
* Will the army system itself actually hold? Logistics, communications, coordination, control over all battlegroups, lines of command, corruption, lies ... something can actually just break down in the full army system. (Currently only pieces breaking down.)
* As weeks go by, the sanctions will be felt.
* Soldier morale: horrible.

**End note:**

* In a larger strategic picture, the cities aren't the main factors. The end result will be determined by the survival of the main UA army in the east. UA army wins and breaks through: can battle Russian units head on. UA army loses: down to guerilla and insurgency.",False,1647115319.0,t3_tcoqao,t3_tcoqao,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

Important excerpt wrt Ukraine war:

> Russia has a lot of weapons that they haven‚Äôt used yet, but there are a couple of factors here. **First of all, Ukraine is winning this war only on Twitter, not on the battlefield. They‚Äôre not winning this war. Russia is advancing very well in the south, which is an extremely valuable place because of the Black Sea littoral and the ports. They are advancing in the east. If the southern and eastern advances meet up, they will encircle and cut off the main forces of the Ukrainian Army. What‚Äôs failed so far is the Russian attempt to take Kyiv in a lightning advance. Otherwise, their war is unfolding well. It‚Äôs only a couple of weeks in; wars last much longer.** . . . Moreover, the largest and most important consideration is that Russia cannot successfully occupy Ukraine. They do not have the scale of forces. They do not have the number of administrators they‚Äôd need or the co√∂peration of the population.",False,1647116187.0,t3_tcoqao,t3_tcoqao,,0,-6,0,-6,0,0,

I get it, the west is helping with sanctions, some small arms, info sharing, but are unwilling to provide the help they are desperately asking for. These contributions show no sign of impeding this invasion. Surely the Ukrainians understand why this is. That they aren't NATO, that it's a regional conflict, and NATO has to look out for their own interests, which are avoiding war with Russia. 

I don't want WWIII, a NFZ, or anything of the sort. I would prefer that is avoided at all costs.

But it would be nice to drop the act by western powers. They can stop taking their victory lap conferences where they bask in the camera and display resolve against the aggressor. They make a show of signing documents and shake hands, make speeches that say how much they care and are committed to stopping Putin. Make menacing quotes with stoic expressions. At the same time treat Zelenksy like he is some animal exhibit, while he is begging for help. Patronizing him in the process.

Should have just stayed out of it altogether. Should stop saying how they stand united with the People of Ukraine and will not let Russia win. Quit with the public displays and constant conferences. It's fake and phony and it's for their interests and their own poll results, not for Ukraine. 

Like I said, I get it. I understand NATO completely for staying out of this to prevent WWIII or nuclear war. Selfishly, I'm totally fine with it, not because I don't care about Ukraine, but because I understand the ramifications of getting involved. But stringing them along, making a big show of nothing is gross. Just be real. 

Also, if not willing to stop Putin completely and go the distance, why do anything at all? Dramatically higher gas prices for a war that was always going to be futile for Ukraine unless they can defend themselves by themselves. If that is the case, than leave them to it and be transparent about it. 

""Russias nuclear arsenal is preventing us (NATO) from engaging in this conflict and we don't want to risk it for a conflict thousands of miles from home for a semi relevant former USSR republic. As a result, there is very little that can be done for you guys. Good luck"" 

Yeah, not what Ukraine wants to hear but at least it would be real and not patronizing feel good bullshit about standing with the people of Ukraine. 

Either get involved and risk it all, or stay out of it. Riding the middle seems like a poor choice. If the US is still determined to play world police and defender of democracy, it should behave like it. Worse than inaction, is action that undermines the principles that democracy is built on and erodes the worlds confidence in the US dominated hegemony. This half assed support of Ukraine weakens the US position more than staying out of it all together. 

They dared Putin not to cross the line, Putin called their bluff, and now is seemingly behaving with impunity in regards to the atrocities committed each passing day. Emboldened with each step, laughing at speculation over charging him with war crime. Then what? More sanctions? More isolation? A stern letter? 

Maybe the sanctions eventually take their toll and bring the end of this and they can take a victory lap in a year's time when Putin is deposed by his own people and Ukraine is smoking rubble. 

NATO should have just stayed in their lane to begin with and stayed out of it. The only reason Ukraine expects support from the west is because it's been dangled in front of them since the fall of the USSR. They thought it would be enough to protect them from the big bad wolf next door, but they were wrong.",False,1647124070.0,t3_tcoqao,t3_tcoqao,,0,-59,0,-59,0,0,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not kidding,‚Äù Senior Lt. Vasyl Vyshyvanyi wrote to her. ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm back, I‚Äôll have a baby with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to come back as fast as possible,‚Äù Ms. Lopushanska responded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have everything, a girl and a boy. The main thing is for you to be well.‚Äù

Hours later, Lt. Vyshyvanyi was killed in combat.

The lieutenant, a 28-year-old paratrooper, died while fighting Russian forces in the Mykolaiv region, according to the 80th Air Assault Brigade. Heavy fighting delayed the return of his body to his family. Five days later, his coffin arrived home.

At the Church of the Most Holy Apostles Peter and Paul in Lviv, in western Ukraine, mourners gathered to pray over Lt. Vyshyvanyi. Another two soldiers from the same brigade were also carried into the church.

‚ÄúGod takes away the best ones,‚Äù said Kyrylo Vyshyvanyi, Lt. Vyshyvanyi‚Äôs older brother, who is also in the military. ‚ÄúHe lived through the worst. He is at peace now.‚Äù

While Ukrainian officials have been quick to report Russian casualties, they have been largely silent about the deaths of their own soldiers.

After two weeks of uncertainty, Ukraine‚Äôs president announced in a news conference on March 12 that around 1,300 soldiers had been killed since the Russian invasion began. That number could not be independently verified.

Lt. Vyshyvanyi‚Äôs military funeral was a solemn reminder that Ukrainian soldiers are fighting and dying every day.

As the funeral procession traveled from Lviv to the family‚Äôs home village of Duliby, residents lined the roadside to pay their respects, kneeling as the cars drove by.

Soldiers carried the flag-draped coffin through a crowd of mourners before Mr. Vyshyvanyi was laid to rest.

Speaking through tears, his mother, Aghaphia Vyshyvana, mourned her son.

So the plan was to have multiple advances along multiple fronts to seize the key cities - after that the Ukrainian government surrenders and a new regime is set up. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. The Ukrainians caught back. Hard. Oops. So those initial columns were cut to pieces. They had better luck in the south because the terrain is better and there were fewer Ukrainian forces. Second, combat requires a ton of resources. Fuel, bullets, food, etc. The Russian logistical train is not that robust. So now they‚Äôre low on supplies and trying to restock while the Ukrainians are wrecking their supply trucks. So the attack stalls. Third, Russians are also running into manpower issues. On average a battalion can cover 1000 yards of front. Ukraine is a huge country, so advancing along multiple fronts while simultaneously securing a hostile population to the rear is becoming increasingly challenging. That‚Äôs why Putin is looking to Chechnya and Syria for reinforcements. Fourth, they have had to change their strategy on the fly from simple quick conquest to a war of attrition/maneuver so they are repositioning their forces. Fifth, they don‚Äôt want to assault a major urban center. In general you need a five to one advantage because in urban combat the defender has a massive advantage. The Russians don‚Äôt have the manpower for that. So they are going to try to isolate the cities and pound them to dust. Unfortunately, that takes time and resources. Which goes back to the second point. Last, the will to fight. These guys weren‚Äôt told much. They‚Äôre attacking people who are defending their homes and families.

Second, he expected that Ukraine would fall in a few days and he could claim this victory for his 70th birthday later this year. He is a brutal tyrant and he is calloused to the suffering of people as he has honed and demonstrated in several similar conflicts. He is no more than his experiences suffering in Leningrad. 

The analysts who have studied Putin for 3 decades have a consensus that is grim. Putin will not stop in Ukraine. He will bring war to more and more places. I would watch interviews with Kasparov, Ioffe, Vindman, and Fiona Hill. Vindman in particular is practically hysterical in making the case that something needs to be done. In fact, Ioffe comes right out and says this will only stop when Putin is dead.  It almost doesn't matter what Putin wants. The west must stop him.

You can take this information in two ways. One is to think that buying more time will mean that Putin will get old and be either deposed or die. Another is to think that since war is inevitable that we need to escalate (this will certainly provoke Putin into using banned weapons including nuclear weapons and biological bombs). I think we need to trust our democratically elected officials to handle those decisions with their experience. Register to vote, donate to candidates you believe in, and prepare yourself to accept the hard changes we need to make to support democracy.

The backup endgame appears to be to at least secure Southeastern Ukraine, giving Russia complete control of the Sea of Azov and a land path to Crimea, alongside the Donbas region.

The Kyiv operation in this case would be more of a distraction to prevent Ukraine from using its forces to secure this area than a viable attempt at the city, though he'll take it if he thinks he can get it.

The way things currently look, Putin will probably accomplish this ""backup"" objective and then focus more on securing these new territories rather than pushing for more.

Mercenary forces were very effective in a number of wars in Africa in the 60s and 70s but mostly because they had modern weapons, military training, and in many cases air support and were fighting lightly armed farmers with no training or combat knowledge. Some of these mercenaries caused a ton of chaos by realising they could effectively fight for themselves and indeed created semi independent mini nations.

More recently we've seen mercenaries effectively working marine security against pirates, and private military contractors doing close protection and escort duties in the Middle East. Used right, they're very powerful and give your regular soldiers some breathing room from the more mundane jobs or the ones that are physically exhausting for long term deployment. Of course, some are effectively just government soldiers but working as ""contractors"" for plausible deniability purposes.

The truth of the matter is that mercenaries (and private military contractors) are a really broad spectrum of people on the whole. Some are nutjobs who live to kill and have no rules, others are highly trained professionals who would give any special forces a run for their money in discipline and training. The majority of them though are just normal ex-soldiers who have simply aged out of military service, either in a conscription system that doesn't offer to recruit onwards (much of Europe for example), where they have reached the end of a fixed term of service as an enlisted soldier, or they're genuinely retired and middle aged, but miss the travel and lifestyle of the soldier.",False,1647126553.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0fauxb,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Not to mention that the single largest remaining trading partner for Russia, China, would almost certainly not like this. If Russia's willing to use chemical weapons on population centers (where the defenders are primarily located) in front of the world's cameras, the chance of Putin deciding to drop a tactical nuke in the Black Sea or something like that as a ""demonstration"" rises dramatically. Russia is going to be China's bitch for the next century at the going rate. A radioactive crater isn't as useful to China.

So my prediction would be that publicly China would continue with their ""We're waiting on further evidence that this was Russia and not Ukraine."" but incidentally and COMPLETELY unrelated to this statement, a lot more Chinese businesses would announce that they've decided, entirely without government consultation of course, to pull out of Russia.

First, no one should ever listen to a word Greenwald says. He‚Äôs a Russian puppet. 


The best propaganda uses some basis in reality. There are research labs in Ukraine that were partnered with the US (who does a ton of this work overseas for the obvious reasons that Covid displayed) for legitimate medical and scientific research. 



The idea that the US was doing biological-weapons research in labs in Ukraine that has been under active Russia threat since 2014 is fucking hilarious to anyone with more than a brain stem. If the US actually wanted to launch some bio weapon we would not involve some 3rd party with a traditionally highly corruptible government next door to Russia. We would make it in our own labs and people and then fly it into the area. Unlike Russia our military and intelligence apparatus isn‚Äôt a fucking embarrassment. 



The entire thing is ludicrous. But, now that they‚Äôve put the propaganda out there when they capture one of these innocuous labs they can plant whatever bullshit they want and say, *see see!* Again, ignoring the obviousness that anything like that, if it existed (which it doesn‚Äôt) would have been destroyed in preparation.",1647117405.0,1647117077.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0eqguh,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

If Russia ""wins"" and has to permanently occupy Ukraine, then keeping most of the sanctions up (even adding more) will cause an already costly occupation to become VASTLY more costly.

If Russia loses and pulls back, some sanctions will likely remain (I could see some sanctions being conditional on Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk being returned to Ukraine's control), but ultimately most of the sanctions will no longer be necessary beyond being purely punitive measures.

Now, I get that ""Fuck Russia, keep them in the stone age!"" is a popular sentiment, but lets say the best case victory happens. They pull back, their government suffers a partial/full collapse/coup and a new one steps in. A gradual reduction in sanctions makes sense in many ways. You want to encourage and help a more cooperative government exist. Being TOO punitive in the long run is ALWAYS counterproductive. And at the end of the day, there IS the humanitarian side of things. It's tempting to take a lot of the stories we hear about random Russians declaring that everything is fine, that Russia is in the right, etc. But we KNOW there's a fair number that are opposed. Look at all the people getting arrested for protesting. Then there's all the people that simply put are only focused on getting through today into tomorrow and have been that way for years. To continue punitive actions that by their nature are collective when the original impetus for them (the war) has concluded is not civilized behavior. Right now it's a necessity, but after the war if there's no other impetus BESIDES being punitive to engage in them, it's very much a ""Kill them all and let god sort it out."" behavior, which civilized society has judged counter to the common good.",False,1647125532.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0f58i2,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

1. Russian army ~~no~~ need to hurry. Why? Logistic sucs, even it depletes without any movement. Plus, they are harassed here and there.
2. encircle all the city. Even only to encircle Kyiv the current deployed army may not suffice as it turns stretched thin. That is the difference between the siege and besieged. The besieged will wither, but in this particular case, see point 1. On top, as they stretch thin, the siege can be easily broken either from inside or pierced feom outside, especially the west. For every city? Never happen. 
3. Pincher attack will work if they have a good logistic support. Else, the may just become salient and then fully encircled become a pocket for a massacre zone. 
4. Air superiority is unfortunately not the case for russian army; as we see helicopers are falling in a dozen.

It could happen but why would he? Am I missing something? Unless he‚Äôs fully crazy but wouldn‚Äôt he have done it by now if that was the case? Or is it a last resort if he lost to nato?

From a technical standpoint, ignoring the political reaction and human toll for a moment, rebuilding after a nuclear strike would not be that much more difficult than any other kind of massive explosion, as long as they stuck to (less polluting) airbursts.

It would kill *many* people. But, basically, they'd need to wait a couple of months for the radiation levels to to drop to normal (or start earlier, and accept that workers would be exposed to moderate levels of radiation -- if they were using Ukrainians as forced labor, that might be the approach they took) and then bulldoze the rubble aside and start rebuilding. ""Bulldoze the rubble and start rebuilding"" would also be required for a conventional war -- those buildings that are blasted out are unlikely to be structurally sound and would need to be razed anyway.

Radiation from fallout goes away quickly. If it's an airburst, there's minimal fallout to start with. If it's a ground burst, 2-3 weeks and the levels would be survivable. A few months until they're negligible. 

NUclear winter is just not a thing, though in a massive exchange there may be climate change and a global impact due to damage to the ozone layer.

Let's truly hope they don't make this calculation, because the loss of life would be immense, and I suspect that a tactical nuke or two would lead to additional escalation from NATO because they would *not* be pleased about being downwind of even minimal levels of fallout.

Side note, groundbursts would likely be used where they wanted to really destroy hardened bunkers or take out runways -- anywhere that a crater was actually desired. Or, as an area denial weapon -- where they *want* to make the ground too hot for troops for awhile. Might also be used against dams and levees and so forth. Airbursts are more likely to be used against civilian targets. That's where you explode the weapon several hundred feet up. The fireball and blast wave thus impact a larger area and cause more destruction to non-hardened structures (like houses) and kill lots of peoplen over a wider area.

God, I hope we never nukes used in war again. (Hiroshima and Nagasaki were airbursts.)",False,1647121029.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0eznsn,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

I don't think it would have much of an effect. Russia is reorganizing its economy east and will continue to do so. It's a clean break from the west no matter what happens moving forward. They aren't going to rejoin western institutions even if it was offered, sell their oil in dollars, or have dollar currency reverse. 

And, China among others has been setting up their own economic systems to counter western institutions. CPIS as an alternate bank messaging system. The Asian Infestructer and Investment Bank as a counter to the IMF, The Shanghai Cooperative alliance as a NATO alternative etc.

The west has lost its monopoly on financial instruments over the past decade and that will probably accelerate given the scorched earth nature of these stations.

If the cooling pools aren't cycled that could cause the water to boil off due to the heat produced by the decaying radioactive elements allowing radiation from those isotopes to be released. If you remember back from basic chemistry to remove electrons from an atom or even changing the state of an element you need a lot of energy which can come in the form of heat. So the cooling ponds are meant to absorb that heat as the elements decay to stable isotopes. It just so happens that water is a very good absorber of heat, which is why ocean temps might be in 50s on a 90 degree day, since it takes a lot of heat to break the bond between the Oxygen and Hydrogen atoms which is a state change for water.

It's not technically a meltdown since it's not uncontrolled reaction in a nuclear core. The fuel rods have to be stored in pools of water for basically 10-20 years before the rod is safe enough for dry storage as the atoms within the rod are cool enough to not trigger a chain reaction due to heat being given off.",False,1647125562.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0fa9o7,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

There's not really a ""choosing not to for ethical reasons"" here.   The US has satellites and our PAVE PAWS early warning radar systems (and I'd not be surprised if we have other means) that can detect an inbound ICBM when it's launched and can very roughly determine its intended flight path and trajectory.

&#x200B;

There is no way of knowing exactly how many nuclear warheads are in that ICBM or its exact target or targets (as they can make midcourse corrections), so *before the warheads even impact*, a decision will be made by the President and the Joint Chiefs as to a response strategy.  The US has a number of predetermined, classified response strategies against predetermined targets based on possible any possible scenario. *(in fact, launching nukes en masse may not even be the totality of said strategies; attack subs shadowing ballistic missile subs may be ordered to pre-emptively engage their shadowed targets, for example)*  I am pretty sure, though I cannot be certain, that none of them are ""wait around and see what happens.""

That's why.  If you say they're evacuees, some people will try to twist it with stupid conspiracy theories.  If you point out that any of them were kids, any kind of propaganda argument becomes absurd on it's face.  They are left to either try to argue that it didn't happen at all which is a lot harder to do since bodies exist, or they have to shut the fuck up and take the L.    
  
That's why it's important to focus on the child casualties when they happen; it really undermines any attempt whatsoever for Russia to try to justify what they're doing.

cfd097b01d689230a77480ec77222152,tcoqao,i0ents9,"KYIV ‚Äì A few hours ago I got a phone call inviting me to a meeting with Zelenskyy. I received a map of the capital Kyiv, marking the location I needed to go to. I went there. After me, representatives of leading world media outlets started arriving there as well. Heavily armed soldiers verified that we were among the invitees. We were put in black cars that took us to a complex of fancy buildings that used to serve as dwellings, not far from President Zelenskyy‚Äôs office.

After one of the most meticulous security checks I had ever gone through, in the course of which I was stripped of my phone, I was asked to walk exactly behind a soldier and security guard walking ahead of me, not straying even an inch. The explanation? To avoid the anti-personnel mines that had been placed in some of the rooms and corridors. The entire complex, it appeared, was the best-guarded compound in the world these days. All around were armored vehicles, anti-tank missile launchers, sand bags, firing positions, tractors (apparently for snow removal) and dozens of armed men.

The dominant color of the high-ceilinged room we entered was military green. The walls were adorned in the European tradition. The curtains were the color of a military uniform. The ceilings had colorful parrots as decoration. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve already been told,‚Äù the president‚Äôs personal spokesman told the journalists, ‚Äúbut I want to again make sure that none of you have any broadcasting equipment, such as phones or live broadcasting equipment. Your personal safety depends on this.‚Äù The president‚Äôs security guards drew the curtains.

After a short wait, the president entered the room and sat down, wearing olive, Palladium-like shoes, black cargo pants and an olive-colored sweatshirt. The president, claiming that the Russian army‚Äôs losses were 10-fold higher than the Ukrainian army‚Äôs losses, seemed relaxed during the almost one-hour session in which he answered questions. No one from his team interfered during this almost clandestine event, and no one inquired in advance about the questions we wanted to ask. Only when speaking about Ukrainian women and children who had been killed by the Russians did he seem emotional, with glittering eyes.

Zelenskyy first answered a question by Haaretz, relating to how he saw Kyiv‚Äôs future. ‚ÄúIf they annihilate all of us, they‚Äôll enter Kyiv,‚Äù he said soberly. ‚ÄúIf there are tens or hundreds of thousands of people, whom Russia is now mobilizing, and they all come with hundreds or thousands of tanks, they‚Äôll penetrate Kyiv. We understand this. If they carpet bomb and erase the historical memory of this whole region, erasing Russia‚Äôs history, Europe‚Äôs history, then they‚Äôll come to Kyiv. If that is their goal, let them enter. But then they‚Äôll have to live on this land alone. Certainly, without us, since they¬†won't find any friends here.‚Äù

Regarding¬†Israeli mediation¬†between Ukraine and Russia, Zelenskyy added that ‚Äúamong the founding fathers of Israel, there were Ukrainian Jews who brought with them their history and a fierce desire to build a wonderful country, as it is now. So, it‚Äôs not so bad to have such mediation.""

""I talked to¬†Mister Bennett and told him that I don‚Äôt think it would be right at this point to meet in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus. These aren‚Äôt places in which we could reach any understandings on stopping the war. I‚Äôm not talking about technical meetings, but about meetings between leaders. I believe Israel could serve as such a meeting place, especially in Jerusalem.‚Äù

According to Zelenskyy, ‚Äúin talking about security guarantees [for Ukraine] and the countries that should be involved in agreements about such guarantees, Israel should definitely be among them.‚Äù

Ukraine‚Äôs president noted that ‚ÄúMany Jews emigrated to Israel from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. There are large numbers of people who speak Ukrainian or Russian there, one and a half million, I believe. These are people with influence on decision makers and I assume that they definitely support us, even though some may support Russia too, since the media play an important role. In Israel, as in Germany and the United States, Russian media has a lot of impact. There are hardly any Ukrainian channels there. I think it‚Äôs time to change that.‚Äù

At the end of the meeting, when he was about to leave the room, a French journalist noted that he looked tired. The president, who even in the midst of a war has not forgotten his sense of humor, turned to the journalist and asked him: ‚ÄúDo you know why I look a bit tired? Maybe it‚Äôs because I am.‚Äù",False,1647114755.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0elboa,,2,4,0,4,0,0,

The assassination of Soleimani (and it was an assassination) broke norms. The US lured him to Iraq under false pretenses and killed him with his Iraq representative as they were leaving the airport. Iran retaliated but gave the US a heads-up first. No deaths meant no response.

The killing of the IRGC in Syria was by Israe and was a pretty standard event (e.g., Syria is a war zone and Iran is openly hostile to Israel, and visa-versa). So retaliating by attacking a US Consulate would be a massive escalation and out of the norm for Iran. I do expect that if the US determines they were the target, they will respond with a limited guided missile strike on the site of the launch.

It's possible that a rogue IRGC commander took it upon himself to launch the attack. Or possible that Khameini himself ordered it. It's possible they were targeting something else and got close to the Consulate. Why launch from Tabriz and hit Erbil? Why not Baghdad? There are larger and more easy to hit US bases in Iraq.

I'm going with rogue commander for the moment. US will respond. Ayatollah will deal with the rogue element and that'll be the end of it.",False,1647130959.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0flnyt,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

Just to be completely correct, it doesn't mean nobility, as Scots nobility falls within the general heraldry of the United Kingdom, given that King James VI of Scotland became the King of England (where he was known as James the First). Thus, the Scottish nobility became British nobility.

In historical terms, it meant a member of a clan. But the whole concept of the Scottish clans was bent in history by Walter Scott's 19th century revisionism.

First round laid out small explosives that disabled vehicles. Next round  searched for heat and exploded on it. So essentially we put down a mine field.

I've explained it to people and they kind of understood it. They also didn't think that Putin would use nukes as that keeps him from getting what he wants (Ukraine), but a lot of them also thought Putin wouldn't invade (they saw it more as Soviet Era posturing).

Edit: And I know that the world, unfortunately, is not a moral place. Governments operate in shades of grey, not black or white. Everything is weighed and balanced, including lives, before action is taken (generally speaking). Politicians are worried about re-election and those who aren't under the current threat of attack are worried about nuclear war.

Unfortunately, war makes politics more conservative, so the chances that Biden will actually go to war are pretty low because it would screw up his domestic agenda. And Biden is pretty anti-war.

And the airstrike on Iran's top general in charge of proxy conflicts. And his proposal to use a nuclear bomb to destroy a hurricane. Those all could have gone very differently, in descending order of world threat level.

There were also serious discussions about attacking Iran directly, and he had China sharply on edge with his post-election behavior.

Additionally, one of his first acts was to tell the US military to be more aggressive in exchange for more civilian deaths, which caused a measurable increase in civilian casualties. He was a vocal proponent of killing families to punish terrorists and the like.

There is an alternate world where one or more of his near misses resulted in a catastrophe.

I get what you are saying, but people put far too much faith in checks and balances of the US system, when in fact it is good behavior by enough participants keeping a lot of the wheels on the rails.

387,072 in 20 years is something like 19'000-20'000 civilians - civilians, not soldiers- who ""have died violent deaths as a result of the wars"" per year. The Iraq war was just one such war. This wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_wars\_involving\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States) lists 11 wars in the 21st century. I wonder how many you can name without looking at the list. People weren't really told about these things the way we're getting info about this war in Ukraine and so basically didn't really care about them. My point was that, considering how hard public opinion has swung against Russia (and obviously the backdrop of several generations being raised in the Cold War), I don't think your average American would care more about Russian civilians than they did about those in Afghanistan, Somalia or Syria.

You bring up 'whataboutism' like it's a catch-all. The question I answered was about how US citizens would feel about a nuclear weapon killing thousands of Russian civilians. If I, in trying to answer them, use previous thousands of civilians killed by US military action as context I don't think that's whataboutism. 

Whataboutism is when somebody uses the 'tu quoque' logical fallacy. It's an attempt to discredit what the person is saying by pointing out their hypocrisy. This is a logical fallacy because if, lets say, a smoker of 40-years tells a teenager that alcohol is bad for their development, their tobacco habit doesn't make what they said any less true.

That's not what I was doing here. I was contemplating the response of the American public to thousands of civilian deaths by discussing the public response to recent events with a similar death toll as per their comment.",False,1647134099.0,t3_tcoqao,t1_i0fqbar,,5,0,0,0,0,0,

This one says 190k allthough just before the War broke out I think the number was close to 300k.

Russia has 3 mil troops total, 300k out of 3 mil is 10% no?

No, in fact what I said is that attacks in Erbil and Baghdad happen often and are usually militias. I then linked some examples.
