Day 400-401 of my updates from Kharkiv.

It’s pretty crazy that it has already been over 400 days since the war started. It really messed with our perception of time because it doesn’t really feel like it started that long ago. And I guess (expectedly) Russians decided to celebrate the 400 days of war anniversary with a new attack on our cities, they really never change.

Yesterday they fired quite a lot of S-300 missiles at our cities, both Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia. At least 6 missiles hit Kharkiv and the explosions were pretty loud here. I’m pretty sure they launched more than 6 missiles, but the rest of them landed somewhere in Kharkiv oblast. It was reported that they were aiming at our infrastructure again, but probably not at our energy, as we had no blackouts after the missile strikes. They also damaged some residential buildings, but thankfully there were no casualties.

They also launched a bunch of Shaheds at some of our cities yesterday. They pretty much exclusively use them to strike cities that they can’t reach with S-300 missiles, so cities like Kyiv get all the Shaheds, while Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia are showered in S-300 missiles, but at the same time we almost never see any Shaheds here. Though we would rather have Shaheds, at least they can be intercepted relatively easily unlike the ballistic S-300 missiles.",False,1680302698.0,t3_1279jox,t3_1279jox,,0,154,0,154,0,0,

So they launch an invasion with roughly 200k (regular army, lpr, dpr, wagner, omon). In the months after and seeing it not go their way, they launch campaigns to sucker in volunteers (who eventually form units of their own). Roughly in September they have to add another 300k through partial mobilisation and even after it concludes they keep recruiting volunteers to replenish losses. Then it turns out that Wagner has been emptying prisons to replenish losses (and subsequently lost the majority around bakhmut and soledar).

They also said they want to make their army bigger (I think from 1.1 million to 1.4 million), while at war and losing personnel daily, which doesn't make sense, but it's russia so whatever). A week or two ago, they announced there were 400k job openings (which is just a mobilisation but worded differently let's be honest)

And now they're officially mobilising another 147k (which is less than half from the first time, so I don't know how they think it's going to work out this time)

But everything is going smooth for their smo guys, just don't look at the hundreds of new graves in wagner cemeteries...

Russia stopped reporting economic data to The IMF and World Bank in December 2022, they say that this information is now classified as top secret. This is a fundamental requirement to be a member of the #IMF and #WorldBank - another topic altogether, just why have these institutions FAILED to kick russia out, is a failing by the heads of those organisations and must be scrutinised publicly and action taken to remedy this failure to act.

Russia is a regime headed by an #indicted #warcriminal and the information it has released, is manipulated to reduce the negative impact that information causes. An example is the recently released official Russian Government war casualty data in March 2023 at just 18000 killed and wounded, which is one tenth the level that independent international reports have calculated with the real numbernear 200,000 - see wsj.com/articles/russi…

Bear this level of under-reporting in mind, when assessing the Russian’s latest published data on their economy in March 2023, a “preliminary report” contained in a press release on 06 March 2023, which is not shared or validated by anyone outside of the criminal regime. 

Assessing the information in their report 👉 2/2

Oil and Gas Revenue in Jan & Feb 2023 = 947 Bn Roubles, a 46.4% reduction from Jan-Feb 2022 at 1.8Trn Roubles

Expenditure:
Total Expenditure in Jan & Feb 2023 = 5.7Trn Roubles, a 51.5% increase on Jan-Feb 2022 at 3.7Trn Roubles.
Total Budget Defecit in the first two months = 2.581Trn Roubles, against a forecasted 12 month TOTAL in 2023 of 2.925Trn Roubles. They have already reached 88% of their full year forecast for 2023. Just a reminder, Russia projected an economic forecast for 2023 based on their projection of the 2.925 projected “ranged forecast” deficit, of -1% to -4%.The #Thumbsucked forecast for 2023 by the IMF published in January 2023 (remember the IMF stopped receiving data from Russia in 2022, predicted an increase of 0.3%)

You don’t need to be an accountant to realise that even the published Russian Government data suggests their economy is in free fall and they have now burnt 88% of the deficit they themselves projected for the whole of 2023 - and with 10 months to go and the net effect of sanctions and the $60 pb price cap on their oil only kicking in from mid-March 2023, the projected deficit at the current rate will top 12 Trillion Roubles for 2023.

Just to conclude on these figures - remember how Russia has manipulated the figures on war casualties, understating them by 90% If that sort of #Putin distortion and propaganda bears out in their published financials, then these figure could theoretically be understated by 90% too. Even if an ultra-conservative view was taken and the figures have only been manipulated to the 30% bullshit level, then Russia will realise a deficit in 2023 upwards for 24 Trillion Rubbles.

The Russian economy is experiencing a catastrophic failure, and their revenues will decline significantly from April - December 2023, while their expenditure is going to rocket over the same period as they run out of resources to support the war, run out of money to pay wages and compensate 200,000 families for their losses in vatnic soldier deaths in #Ukraine

> On the afternoon of March 31, Russia launched another missile attack on Zaporozhye. The city was attacked with an Iskander-M missile. The epicenter of the explosions was a local cemetery in the Kommunarsky district. Here is a huge funnel, dozens of broken graves. Part of the cemetery has been destroyed. Initially, it was reported that up to ten houses and several garages with cars were damaged by the blast after the missile attack. Some houses, like those of a local resident Yulia, are practically destroyed. 

> Toward evening, it became known that many more houses were damaged as a result of the impact - more than 50. Rescuers continue to sort out the rubble.

Ukraine let Russia gain some ground around the city. To the point where Russia would think it can really encircle it is it only put more meat in the grinder. Ukraine knew they could keep Bakhmut.

You can look more Russians if the frontline is longer. A circle has three times the length of a line the same width. So Ukraine can inflict three times more casualties of they let Russia surround them instead of keeping them on the other side of the river.

This quote from Wikipedia may explain why:  
>Soviet Spetsnaz units had advanced training with the MPL-50, which they mostly used as a weapon for close quarters combat rather than for entrenching. The spade is well balanced, which allows it to be used as a throwing weapon.[4]  

Yet, the next section of the same article states:  
>In March 2023, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Russian military reservists fighting in Ukraine had resorted to using MPL-50s in hand-to-hand combat, due to a shortage of ammunition.[5][6][7]  

Plus, during a major protest where the Soviet military used tanks and other armoured vehicles, the protestors did manage to drag out people and cause trouble.

Assuming no circumstantial change (=idiots continue this pointless war), they have only two choices - increase the revenues or decrease the spending. 

Increasing the revenue means getting more money from inner economy (Russia itself) or outer economy (exporting to foreign countries in exchange for money). Their foreign trade is essentially dead now (except of very pragmatic China and bootlicking Belarus), so not a realistic way of getting money. When it comes to the inner economy, they have options to print money or increase taxes/bills. If I would be in charge of Russian government in such situation, I would be trying to compensate through increased bills in energy usage (so not showing an increase in tax rates publicly) and nationalising the profits of Gazprom and similar companies, as well as adding a small amount of money through money printing.

Cutting the expenses seem to be a much more realistic option. Russian government would stop funding roads, railways, airports and new infrastructural developments throughout the country. Scientific research, pensions, welfare - everything would be cut down in as they're not a priority of a war machine. Brutal consequences of such actions would be felt in a decade or so, but not now, so the short term gains would be prioritised, as the country is draining its resources.

Even if they stop the war right now, a lot of the sanctions wouldn't be lifted and (re)gaining confidence from the potential investors would take decades.",1680291273.0,1680290978.0,t3_1279jox,t1_jefyna4,,1,14,0,14,0,0,

Indeed I've made that same point myself before in these very threads.  However I disagree with some of the specifics in your comment.

First of all, it's important to note that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear breach of the UN Charter.  That doesn't mean they should be kicked out of the UN, but your club analogy breaks down in this situation because clubs will typically discipline/suspend/expel members who break their rules.

Secondly, it's not true that ""nothing happens unless everybody agrees to it"".  Yes, not much can happen unless the *Security Council* resolves that action should be taken, but that doesn't require unanimity.  In fact it only requires a simple majority of the members for the time being, provided that none of the five permanent members vote against.  Of course, since Russia is one of those five, they can effectively veto any resolution they don't like.  But, in other situations, the UN has taken action even without unanimity of the permanent members of the Security Council (eg where some merely abstain).

But yes, even without Russia's veto, the options available to the UN in this case are somewhat limited.  They could authorise a peacekeeping force... but what countries would want to provide boots on the ground directly against Russia in this conflict?  After all, NATO have already made clear that it's not something they're going to do.  Besides that, the Security Council could I suppose try to impose sanctions at the UN level, with secondary sanctions against states that violate them, but that would probably never get approved and even if it did would cause much bigger geopolitical rifts/consequences than we already face.

Yep. And it presupposes a level of genius and predictive capability of the Ukrainian forces that they simply don't have. They don't have the ability to forecast Russia's battle successes two months into the future. They couldn't have had any certainty that the Russians wouldn't be able to close a final, 8-kilometer gap on the last two roads after two months of the most intense fighting of the entire war. Ukraine's POV in January was that Russia / Wagner had a good chance of successfully surrounding the city within a few months.

tl;dr seems to be:  
- many countries waving a white flag shows intent to *discuss* surrender terms  
- actual surrender should be along with unambiguous signs you are not a threat (ie: raised arms, fully exposed, not in combat)  
- one person/party cannot try to surrender if the other side is still being attacked by others in the former's group    
  
An extract below gives an example deemed to not be a legal surrender, and why many think a white flag is now an intent to surrender:   
  
""The US Law of Armed Conflict Deskbook also rejects the use of the white flag as being declarative of surrender, and discusses the use of the white flag in the context of the 1982 Falklands Conflict:Footnote 110

During the Battle for Goose Green, some Argentinean soldiers raised a white flag. A British lieutenant and two soldiers advanced to accept what they thought was a proffered surrender. They were killed by enemy fire in a disputed incident. Apparently, one group of Argentines was attempting to surrender, but not the other group. The Argentine conduct was arguably treachery if those raising the white flag killed the British soldiers, but not if other Argentines fired unaware of the white flag. This incident emphasizes the rule that the white flag indicates merely a desire to negotiate, and its hoister has the burden to come forward.""",False,1680323558.0,t3_1279jox,t1_jehxk8f,,3,3,0,3,0,0,

The idea is that in a large conventional war, you start off with a large enough stockpile of them that will last you until you've ramped up production under a wartime building program. They are also not giving Ukraine all they have either, they are still keeping enough of a stockpile to feed the US needs as well. Another factor to consider is that the GMLRS rockets is not the only rocket, there are unguided versions that allow those hundreds of US systems to be used as a regular MLRS. The US is actually tapping into their massive stockpile of old unguided cluster munitions, scrapping the warhead, taking the rocket and attaching them to a guided small diameter bomb to create the Ground Launched Small Diameter Bomb to help alleviate the lack of guided rockets.


Just to note here the GMLRS in Ukraine are shouldering the heavy burden of being the main precision guided weapon of the Ukrainian military whereas in the US military it is just 1 of 20 different long range guided systems. All the rest of them are either air / sea launched or too long range to hand over, so because they are being so heavily relied upon those excess stockpiles are being burned through fairly quickly. Recently they've fitted MiG-29's with the ability to use JDAM's and JDAM-ER's and Ukraine is also being supplied with additional MiG's from Poland and Slovakia.

I do agree with this.   However, the Ukrainians aren't planning around this in mind, but with overall goals fully in the picture.

The Russians (or at least Prighozin, anyways) stated that they were going to seek to rest and reconstitute their units once Bakhmut was taken.  Though a defense in such a compact and crowded area was going to be costly with enemy troops, artillery and aviation able to focus on such a small area, I think a decision was made in Ukrainian high command that keeping the Russians from reconstituting their forces again were worth the effort, especially with the strain that not only deploying forces but keeping an already distressed supply situation working to a near breaking point.   When it also became clear that the Russians were willing to throw the baby, the bathwater and the nanny into the fight to get that win, that only made holding the position more attractive.

The longer they can draw this out, the more they can delay until they can get more armaments and weapons into the country in the hands of troops, identify potential weaknesses in the theater of operations, and perform the required planning and training to shift into a more counter-offensive mode.
