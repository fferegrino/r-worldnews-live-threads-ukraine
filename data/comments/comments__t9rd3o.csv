The holdup has been that Article 5 of NATO fails to envision the following scenarios, and Poland wanted clarification if Article 5 would be triggered.  NATO Counsel could not give clear answers.

FIRST SCENARIO:  UKRAINIAN PILOTS PICKING THEM UP
 
The complication here was if Russia or Belarus shoots down a MiG, piloted by a Ukrainian pilot, before the pilot crosses into Ukraine.  This situation would be a donated jet, now in possession of Ukraine, but behind polish border. It’s been undetermined whether that triggers article 5. UK pledged to back Poland in such a situation.  The counsel of NATO believed that if happened in Polish skies, would likely trigger NATO. Poland worried either way and didn’t want to invite attack. 


SECOND SCENARIO:   A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR, SUCH AS FORMER PILOT, DELIVER THE MIGS TO UKRAINE

The Poles thought a work-around was possible:  a non-state actor, such as private contractor, could fly the planes into Ukraine.  Poles did not want it to be from their air bases, so as to not be attacked. 

Additionally, if in transit from an USA base, then at least could limit the aggression to something the USA has to sort out. Not automatically NATO, the Poles believed.

But this just opens door to more countries having their airspace flying over (Germany, Czech, etc).  So the same issue exists, just with more countries.

USA considers this not feasible, because again opened a second article 5 issue—if an American contractor, flying an American/Polish donated plane was shot down in Ukraine trying to deliver, does that trigger article 5?  The counsel at NATO believed less likely, though not definitively; however, would be seen as too participatory by Russia. 

Bc these questions couldn’t be answered within NATO with confidence, this transfer has become messy, stalled, confounding.",False,1646782402.0,t3_t9rd3o,t3_t9rd3o,,0,28,0,28,0,0,

In my mind the only reason China matters is they sit on the security council. I doubt any of the other 3 members will, but China doing so gives legitimacy and complicates things.

Otherwise, a Ukrainian government in abstentia can maintain official ties, and the Russians and puppet government can be bled to death through a destroyed economy until they have to acquiesce. 

But China can make that a moot point. 

I know this is a somewhat fatalistic thought process, but hoping for the best and preparing for the worst - still unfortunately requires considering the worst could happen.

There's no secret sauce, there must be local bottling plants that bottled coke, and they'll just start running them again, they'll put people to work in these restaurants and businesses and things will appear to function as normal. For stuff they have to import, I'm betting China will supply the knockoffs and then secondary sanctions start hitting and the world will get even more screwed.

Edit - lol, downvoted for wondering if Russia will just open these businesses up on their own. Does not matter to me, but typical.

2nd Edit - Russia announced they were doing exactly what I thought they might. So in the words of General Gordon Ramsay, you donkey's were wrong.

Because of the marginal utility of income this is going to hurt the poorest of America the most. Why? I don’t fucking get it. I mean will cutting off Russian energy harm Russia and make them have less money for the war effort? Sure I can see that. 

But even if that’s 100% certain it’s still not worth it. Biden was elected by the people is Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. not the people of Kiev, Odessa, or Kharkiv. Why is Biden (and both sides of Congress for that matter) prioritizing the people of Ukraine over his own constituents, his own people? We’ve already spent over 5 trillion dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan when we could’ve spent it here right in America building schools and hospitals, laying miles of road and rail, and helping fulfill our children’s hopes and dreams. 

Now, after wasting 5 trillion dollars on trying to “help” the people of foreign nations we’re going to again hurt the poorest of our people for a country on the other side of the globe? I’m actually so incredibly disappointed.

Countries loan each other money all the time, their credit rating is used to determine how likely they are to pay that money back. The higher the rating the more likely they will pay it back and the better the terms they are able to borrow on.

Fitch is just saying out loud what everyone already knows: don't lend Russia money and if you already lent them money you're about to be SoL on getting that back. That default is imminent and will drive the cost of Russian debt into the floor. That debt will likely eventually be bought up by vultures making long term bets that they can force Russia to pay some of it back once recovery begins.

It's a dramatic gesture, but an inevitable one regarding a situation everyone was already aware of.

In terms of practical effects it can drive market panic, but Russia's markets are closed anyway so we won't be seeing that soon. There's plenty of reasons for Russian markets to be panicking anyway, this is just a drop in the bucket.

Putin’s other bad assumption is that a) NATO would not get involved because their rules dictate that they will not defend a non-member. The lines for that are grey to say the least. And b) NATO will not admit a new member when their borders are disputed. 

It is this line that NATO is currently uncomfortable about crossing, but there is nothing stoping NATO from changing their own rules, if and when it suits them. Putin seems to assume that they will not. 

Currently it does not suit NATO to do so, and would escalate the situation. NATO are quite happy to continue on the current trajectory, and although it knows civilians are being killed and Ukrainian cities are being destroyed, that loss is empowering anti-Russian sentiment extremely effectively worldwide, and in the long term ensures Russia’s collapse, Putin’s fall and thus ending the Cold War (and Luke-Warm War of the last three decades).",False,1646779614.0,t3_t9rd3o,t1_hzw9xhj,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

While I do not trust Russian media, there is a lot of footage of their advances which is verifiable by foreign observers.

This isn’t a doom post or pro Russian. I just feel people really, really need to manage their expectations here. It’s easy to get drawn in by the momentum of threads like this and also the Ukrainian reports which are almost all unverified - I can’t blame them they’re raising morale.

They're also not going to be able to get parts or service for any of their Western aircraft, so even domestic air travel is likely to rapidly disintegrate. I'm not even sure if they can fully maintain the Sukhoi Superjets given that the engines are partly French.

Flying the planes from Poland next door to Ukraine would be perfect.

The aircraft would have to fly a short distance, allowing them to carry self-defense Air-to-Air weaponry and enough fuel to enter combat if needed.

Going from Rammstein in (western) Germany to Ukraine presents a problem.

1) Distance. The aircraft have to fly a lot further, making it infeasible to carry weapons or enough fuel for emergency combat when entering Ukrainian aerspace. These MiGs cannot refuel whilst airborne, and have short range. Even when carrying a drop tank.

2) Time. It not only takes a lot longer, by having to bring the Ukrainian pilots to Germany first, but it will leave the first delivered MiGs a lot longer exposed without back up (little to no fighter cover) and a lot less pilots within Ukraine to take turns flying the aircraft.

Russian state media is trying to get the idea going of Ukraine creating a “dirty bomb”. they will probably massage that idea enough that the Russian people readily believe that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that was responsible. 

Yeah I’m speculating. But I’ll I’m doing is drawing a line through data points as they exist right now.

 >Uzhhorod International Airport, (Ukrainian: Міжнародний аеропорт «Ужгород»; Slovak: Medzinárodné letisko ""Užhorod"") (IATA: UDJ, ICAO: UKLU) is an international airport located in the city of Uzhhorod, in the western Ukrainian province of Zakarpattia. The airport is situated in the westernmost part of the city, in the Chervenytsia district at 145, Sobranetska Street. It is a small airport, serving Uzhhorod and the whole oblast. The airport's runway begins 90 meters from the Ukrainian-Slovak international border, so planes must use Slovak airspace for take-offs and landings under special treaty.

Putin's chief concern right now is the international response and the slowness of the advance as it stands now.

Reason why is there is a need to show some real accomplishment to his population before negotiating a favorable settlement to the conflict.

He can, possibly, get Ukranian capitulation if he keeps up the pressure, but every day this continues his ability to maintain control over Russia and fight future enemies diminishes.

If I were Putin and I had access to an unbiased form of information from all around the world or even had a person who would compile my general appeal to the public, I would be worried about almost everyone in the West and most of Europe unanimously deciding that he's in the wrong and shouldn't be tolerated, that should scare him because it's likely that he had a second step after Ukraine. Other countries and NATO are sending in troops to bordering areas, they're giving them money while restricting Russia's, they're giving them the ability to fight this war without having to put NATO members into Ukrainian territory.  As for me, I can't answer for whether he's lying or not, for starters my only experience is having to learn to recognize emotions and be able to replicate them, this also includes lying, this is in order to blend in with everyday life.  So I'm not experienced, and he's Russian, I'm American. I can't pick up an inflection in his tone, which can't help me to look for other things.  Also, he's a former KGB Agent, much more trained at deception than I am at detection deception.

The population is also a lot more hostile than I assume he expected, making control difficult.

* Putin is worried about losing his own personal position. He has made a big mistake and it's very obvious for anyone to see. So he has to cover up that mistake by pretending it's not true. Because he is very powerful, everyone around him is also pretending. But secretly, the people are thinking he has made a mistake. And Putin is afraid of that, because if the people around him think he is a failure, they might not support him any more and he would lose his job.

* Because of this, Putin now has to attack Ukraine even harder. If he can capture some cities he can say that he is winning and people won't think he made a mistake anymore. 

* But he is still worried that other countries might still get involved. If that happens, he knows he will lose the fight. So he has to pretend he is very strong and not afraid of anything, so that everyone else will be afraid of him and doesn't think to fight him. But secretly and in his own mind he is not really sure if they still think that, and that makes him scared.

* Putin is also afraid of his own people in Russia. They don't really like him but because he was strong they couldn't really go against him. But now because he is killing people in Ukraine, some people in Russia are really mad at Putin and no longer afraid. So they are protesting and hoping that everyone will join them and get rid of him. Putin is very afraid of that, so he is making all sorts of laws and rules to stop that, and telling his police to arrest anyone who is protesting against him. 

* Putin is also worried about all the sanctions other countries are putting against Russia. He wants to be remembered as a great man who made Russia a strong and powerful country. But now people in Russia are going to be poor, because the rest of the world doesn't want anything to do with Russia and not sell them anything, or buy anything from them either. So when Putin was trying to make Russia strong, he actually made it weak, and he is even more worried that the people in Russia will protest against him.

* Putin is also very upset with himself. He thought he was this really smart person who was always getting away with things. But then he made a big mistake by attacking Ukraine. He thought he was going to win the fight in just a few days and people in Ukraine would be happy to see his soldiers. Instead, the people in Ukraine are very angry at his soldiers and fighting against them very hard. So now it is taking a very long time, and Putin is not even sure he is going to win. Instead of being smart and getting away with it, he has made a huge mess of things and everyone is angry with him. So now he is upset with himself and angry because he was not as smart as he thought, and everyone is looking at him like he is pretty stupid.",False,1646782681.0,t3_t9rd3o,t1_hzwha7h,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Send convicts and ""socially unreliable"" political prisoners there (so that they don't mess with the water inside the country) - the morale of the army will simply go into the negative. And the enemy is motivated, terribly motivated. He knows how to fight, there are enough middle-level commanders there. There are weapons. They have support. We will simply set a precedent for human loss in the world. And that's it.

What we are most afraid of: at the top, they act according to the rule of overlapping the old problem with a new problem. Largely for this reason, the Donbass of 2014 began - it was necessary to divert the attention of Westerners from the topic of the Russian spring in Crimea, so the Donbass crisis, it seems, should have drawn all the attention to itself and become the subject of bargaining. But there were even bigger problems. Then they decided to push Erdogan into 4 pipes of the South Stream and entered Syria - this is after Soleimani gave deliberately false inputs in order to solve his problems. As a result, it was not possible to close the issue with Crimea, there are also problems with the Donbass, the South Stream has shrunk to 2 pipes, and Syria has hung with another headache (if we go out, they will demolish Assad, which will make us look like idiots, but it’s also difficult and useless to sit).

I don't know who came up with the ""Ukrainian Blitzkrieg"". If we were given real introductory information, we would at least indicate that the original plan is controversial, that we need to double-check a lot. A lot of things. Now we got into the shit somewhere up to the neck. And it is not clear what to do. ""Denazification"" and ""demilitarization"" are not analytical categories, because they do not have clearly defined parameters by which one can determine the level of accomplishment or non-completion of the task.

Now it remains to be seen that some fucking adviser will convince the top to start a conflict with Europe demanding to reduce some sanctions. Or reduce, or war. What if they refuse? Now I do not rule out that then we will be drawn into a real international conflict, like Hitler in 1939. And then our Z will be compared to us with a swastika.

Is there a possibility of a local nuclear strike? Yes. Not for military purposes (it will not give anything - this is a defense breakthrough weapon), but with the aim of intimidating others. At the same time, the soil is being prepared to turn everything to Ukraine - Naryshkin and his SVR are now digging the earth to prove that they secretly created nuclear weapons there. Damn, they are now hammering on what we have long studied and dismantled: you can’t draw evidence here on your knee, and the presence of specialists and uranium (Ukraine has a lot of depleted isotope 238) is nothing. There the production cycle is such that you can’t do it imperceptibly. You can’t even make a “dirty” bomb imperceptibly, but the fact that their old nuclear power plants can produce weapons-grade plutonium (plants like REB-1000 produce it in minimal quantities as a “by-product” of the reaction) - so the Americans introduced such control there with the involvement of the IAEA, that sucking on the topic is stupid.

Do you know what will happen next week? Well, even after two. Now it will cover us so much that we will start to miss the hungry 90s. While the auction was closed, Nabiullina seemed to be taking normal steps - but this is all like plugging a hole in a dam with a finger. It will still break through, and even stronger. Nothing will be decided in 3, 5, or 10 days.

Kadyrov beats his hoof for a reason - they have their own adventures there. He created for himself the image of the most influential and invincible. And if it falls once, it will be taken down by its own people. He will no longer be the owner of the winning teip.

We go further. Syria. ""The guys will hold out, everything will be over in Ukraine - and there in Syria we will again strengthen everything in positions."" And now, at any moment, they can wait there for the contingent to run out of resources - and such a heat will set in ... Turkey blocks the straits - to transport supplies there by planes, it's like heating an oven with money.

Notice that all this is happening at the same time, we don’t even have time to bring everything into one heap. We have a situation, like in Germany in the 43-44th. At the start right away. Sometimes I am already lost from this overwork, sometimes it seems that everything was a dream and it was a dream, that everything is as before.

In prisons, by the way, it will be worse. Now the nuts will begin to tighten so that to the bloody ichor. Everywhere. To be honest, purely technically, this remains the only chance to keep the situation - we are already in the mode of total mobilization. But you can’t stay in such a regime for a long time, and we have ambiguity with the timing and it will only get worse for now. From mobilization, management always goes astray. Yes, and imagine: you can run a hundred meters in a snatch, but it’s bad to go to a marathon distance and give a jerk with all your might. Here we rushed with the Ukrainian question, as if we were running a hundred meters, and fit into a cross-country marathon.

And that's what I'm talking about very, very briefly.

From the cynical, I will only add that I do not believe that VV Putin will press the red button to destroy the whole world.

Firstly, there is more than one person making a decision, at least someone will jump off. And there are a lot of people there - there is no ""one-man red button"".

Secondly, there are some doubts that everything is functioning successfully there. Experience shows that the greater the transparency and control, the easier it is to identify shortcomings. And where it is not clear who controls and how, but always bravura reports - everything is always wrong there. I'm not sure if the red button system works as advertised. In addition, the plutonium charge must be changed every 10 years.

Thirdly, and this is the most vile and sad thing, I personally do not believe in the readiness to sacrifice oneself of a person who does not let the members of the Federation Council, but his closest representatives and ministers, come close to him. For fear of the coronavirus or an attack, it doesn't matter. If you are afraid to let the most trusted people near you, then how will you dare to destroy yourself and your loved ones, inclusive?

If anything - ask, but I can not answer for several days. We are in rush mode, and there are more and more tasks.

In general, our reports are peppy, but everything flies in the pi_du.

From the Ruble standpoint you would need to pay 1 Ruble to purchase 0.5 US Dollar (hypothetical example). This transaction is also described as conversion rate, because it dictates the conversation of one currency into another (using one currency to buy another currency).

Knowing this, the question is, why is the freeze of central bank assets so significant?

Well, Putin spent years to build up a war chest in € Euro and US Dollar $ to be able to counteract incoming sanctions. 

Why did he use foreign currencies to build his war chest? Because he anticipated the impact sanctions would have on the Russian Ruble - which is what we are seeing now, a devaluation of the Ruble.

This means that pre sanctions, Putin used 100 Rubles to buy 50 US Dollars because he knew that after sanctions hit the Ruble would be worth less, which in turn means that he would be able to buy less US Dollars for 100 Rubles -> post sanctions he would be able to only buy 25 US Dollars

And this is why the freeze of his central bank assets is so significant - he thought he would have billions worth of US Dollar and Euros in his central bank. Now that he cant access those, while at the same time the anticipated effect of the Ruble crashing in value materialised, he is in a very tough spot because he essentially cant afford enough foreign currency to keep on paying for his war while also keeping the country running.

The continuous sinking of value for the Ruble will then in turn lead to the Ruble not being worth the paper it is printed on, which leads to inflation, runaway inflation and hyperinflation which essentially is a state where the currency does not have any real quantifiable value left. 

Where pre hyperinflation you paid 3 Rubles for a piece of bread, you might pay 100.000 Rubles for ond piece of bread. This situation can currently be observed in Venezuela or also Zimbabwe.

China sits in a weird place in all this, because they *want* a nationalist world to fulfill their objectives. But they need the globalist order for growth to pull it off.

Basically:

-NATO does not want to be involved in any way

-Poland is a NATO country

-Poland wants its fighter jets given to Ukraine

-US says you have the green light to give them to Ukraine

-Poland says, ""Ok, I'll give them to the USA, and the USA can give them to Ukraine""

-USA says, ""No, we never said WE would give them to Ukraine, we just said that we don't have an issue with YOU giving them to Ukraine""

-Ukraine: ""Ok so who the fuck is delivering these god damn jets?""

Thats... Basically it.

Lots of people in here and on Twitter are pointing the finger to the USA saying this is their issue and they should just go along with Poland's plan.

Russia are clearly worried about the impact of the sanctions, which suggests both that nukes aren't an option and that they're capable of doing their job. Putin claiming they're akin to declaring war and whining about how it doesn't have to be this way is evidence that he's at least concerned. 

2. Ukraine are being supplied by NATO and some others, Russia are pretty much on their own.

3. Russia severely underestimated Ukraine and overestimated their own operational capabilities. Supply chain issues like they've seen in the last 2 weeks are only likely to get worse, and warfare is highly reliant on logistics.

4. Putin may appear crazy, but he isn't. He's very calculating. Unfortunately for him, it seems highly likely that he's been being lied to about how well equipped and prepared his military is. There's been a lot of whispers that much of the money that should have been going to their military has been stolen. He won't back down as it stands because it would make Russia look even weaker, and he wants to appear strong, but logistical and economic problems on a large scale could yet force him to.

5. The Ukrainian people are doing a phenomenal job so far. Their spirit is unbelievable and nobody really believed they could hold out this long. The longer it continues this way, the more chance they have of winning. They're actually fighting *for* something, most of the Russian soldiers seem to have no idea why they're there. That's a big difference in motivation. Even if Russia do manage to take control, the Ukrainians aren't going to stop fighting. History suggests that, eventually, people fighting for their freedom regularly succeed. It won't be over even if we reach a point where Russia claims they've won.

As horrible and cynical as this sounds, nobody cared when Putin bombed the shit out of Aleppo. Now his imperialistic horseshit is brushing up against NATO territory, however and what he's trying to do is seriously going to upset the balance in Europe. Everyone knows if he gets way with vassalizing Ukraine he'll try to do it to the Balkans or Moldova. Not only that our reaction to this is being watched by other powers like China. If they feel it's weak and permissive they'll take the opportunity to throw international law in the trash can and we'll be back to a time when wars of conquest are accepted practice. I shouldn't have to point out how absolutely hideous and blood drenched the 20th century was. 

The entire liberal-democratic, legalistic, international order that's kept nation states more or less in line for the past 70 years is being directly threatened (never mind, if we're being honest, American hegemony). Putin wants to rebuild Russia as a superpower and undermine that consensus that has existed since the 90's. 

The US and NATO are not going to let him win this. They can't afford to. They might stop short of actively shooting at Russian soldiers, but anything short of that is clearly on the table. If you told me 2 weeks ago the US would agreed to voluntarily tank the stock market and drive up oil prices I would have called you insane. 

All those sanctions on Russia hurt American corporations also. I want you to let that sink in: our corrupt plutocracy of a government suddenly grew balls and decided it cared about something more than money. 

Even if Putin wins this phase of the war we're going to be sending CIA agents with shipments of rifles and grenades into that country for decades. We did it to them in Afghanistan. And we're going to do it again. 

The US has done far worse things for far worse reasons to countries before. What it is going to do to Russia over the next 10 years in Ukraine is almost expected at this point.  

Consider this: nobody in our government who matters seriously thinks the Ukrainians can hold back Russia. They just don't have enough people and equipment, and what they do have is spread so thin across the country that sooner or later Russia is going to break through barring some kind of miracle. 

So why are we flooding the country with NATO toys? 

Because we know it's not going to end there. We're making a world where every Ukrainian farmer has a javelin in the shed.

Giving Ukraine arms and intelligence is about the most we are capable of barring getting into a shooting war with Russia. 

I suppose a non-nuclear country like Poland (I think?) could send troops and then publicly go ""we're doing this alone, NATO isn't involved"" but there's no way the Russians would buy that line and there's no telling how they'd react. There's a good chance they'd just assume (rightly, I guess) that they're at war with NATO anyway and start bombing Estonia. 

They could also do something like they did in the Balkans and send NATO troops there ostensibly on ""peacekeeping"". If NATO plopped ""neutral"" troops in Kiev to ""monitor the humanitarian situation"" or something like that I doubt Putin would be so chevalier about bombing the place. But see the thing is, again, nobody's pulling one over on him and he'd know we're basically just another army he has to fight and it's only a matter of time before he's in a shooting war with us anyway. 

At the end of the day there's no greater involvement for NATO that doesn't result in nuclear war. And I want to make this clear because people keep downplaying this: if both factions assume any conflict means nuclear war (and they do) then both factions are already primed to push the red button, and will. It's not a risk worth taking. Not like the Ukrainians are going to be less dead then the rest of us. 

Most we can do is give the Ukrainians fancy toys. Putin can bitch and moan about that but he did it in Syria, and besides it keeps NATO troops officially uninvolved.

- Send 30 jets now, Russia uses this to justify massive escalation of violence on civilians and major cities, including greater attacks on western Ukraine.  NATO gets cold feet and doesn’t want to send more.  In the end 30 jets won’t be enough anyway.

- Hold off and use as a carrot for Russia to avoid ramping up civilian violence.  Put the ball in their court.  If they do ramp up, I think NATO will go all in on a bigger effort and send Ukrainians 100+ Soviet jets and helicopters.  If they don’t ramp up, good you may have saved some lives and avoided escalation.

- The other benefit of a delay is NATO could actually be cross training Ukrainian pilots on American hardware while waiting, which could be used later in greater quantities.  

People need to realize that what has united the west is the moral high ground - releasing all their invasion plans early really gave the west the mandate to act in a strong and unified way.  I think this kind of strategy immensely frustrates Putin even if he lies to his people about it.  Notice how he immediately pivoted to recreating the Russian Empire right after invading?

Or for the US to admit they have been giving real-time intel to Ukraine. Or any of the military support that has been sent to Ukraine and broadcast to the world from a dozen different countries.

Russia started this war by drawing a big line in the sand making it clear that: if foreign armies join the fight in Ukraine against Russian forces, it could start a nuclear war.

You don't see Putin constantly threatening to nuke Turkey and the US and the UK and France, Japan, Germany, Poland... etc. And you don't see them threatening nuclear war because of the sanctions that are destroying their economy. Because they know they can't get away with playing the nuke card on every demand they have.

Nukes are buying Russia the space it needs to win the Ukrainian war, and eliminate the possibility of a counter-attack on Russian soil. And that's all they are going to get out of them.

The rest of the world is so blatantly helping Ukraine because it they can't afford to let Russia get away with anything it wants because of the nuclear threat. Someone playing it safe would have sent no help to Ukraine. They may have held back on sanctions as well. Ukraine would have fallen by now, and Putin would be drawing up plans to do the same thing all over again with Finland or Moldova (or rushing towards whatever country got closest to being accepted into NATO).

The only thing stopping Poland from giving them the jets is the same thing stopping the USA from doing it:

No one wants to get pulled into this war. 

So yeah, it does make sense for them to say that Poland's plan lacks rationale, when the only thing their plan does that giving the planes directly to Ukraine doesn't do is:

Shifts responsibility of the transfer to the USA.

I don't understand why everyone's struggling to understand the Pentagon's response to this plan. It's pretty fucking obvious that Poland doesn't want to be the ones to give them the jets and, shockingly, no-one else in the region seems inclined to do so either.

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

But in truth beyond being an irrational actor like North Korea threatening nukes every month, it's hard to take Russia seriously when their economy is less than that of California alone. Russia simply is not by definition a superpower and in no way has a geopolitical clout in proportion to its geographical size.

I hope a lesson is learned in all this; that to give a dictator an inch, they will try to take a mile. After Georgia's creeping-annexation and Crimea, along with defense of Assad and his use of WMDs against his own citizens...

Of course that's not how it works, but if we round the numbers and use the same percentages you could say that russia makes about 1bln per year profit in russia, which would amount to more than 30months/2,5 years of paying them.

 >White Coke (Russian: Бесцветная кока-кола, tr. Bestsvetnaya koka-kola, lit. ""colorless Coca-Cola"") was a clear variant of Coca-Cola produced in the 1940s at the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov. Like other clear colas, it had the same flavor as the original, virtually unchanged by the absence of caramel coloring.

The DOE has even had lawsuits brought against them by groups like Keep Yellowstone Nuclear Free just for operating the site. 
While I know a lot of people who work out there, I know if none who flow in the dark because of it. 
I was working road construction before college and worked a flagging job out near the facility. One guy that I stopped complained that I stopped him there and he said to me, ""I usually drive 95mph through here to limit my exposure.""

As part of the KyivNotKiev campaign, Ukraine asks that their capital be called _**Kyiv**_ (/ki:v/ KEEV) (derived from the Ukrainian language name Київ) instead of _Kiev_ (derived from the Russian language name).

> The ""KyivNotKiev"" campaign is part of the broader ""CorrectUA"" campaign, which advocates a change of name in English; not only for Kyiv, but also for other Ukrainian cities whose English names are derived from Russian as well.

Plus you can't do anything about it anyway. But it's not something to dismiss as 20th century fear tactic and not an issue either. It's somewhere in between, hopefully on the more positive side. What worries me some is that if there are people vocally saying that a few nukes won't be much more than conventional attacks, higher ups that control and advise leaders may also have the same opinion, and so the layers of redundancy to prevent haphazard use is lessened.

I hope that if something does happen, it's just a single incident and with our enhanced ability to show it now we'll be so shocked at the result that it will make us set down nuclear weapons across all nations.

For the Russian government's it's not a major problem compared to war and sanctions, not least since Russia's given up any pretext of being a free-market economy; Putin can just force banks to buy government bonds or whatever he wants. If they default on rouble-denominated bonds bought domestically, it'll cut the value of the assets held by Russian banks, pension funds and the like, which is a problem. But it's less likely that will happen; it's foreign currency they lack to tender their loans, not roubles.

 >Air Force One is the official air traffic control call sign for a United States Air Force aircraft carrying the president of the United States. In common parlance, the term is used to denote US Air Force aircraft modified and used to transport the president and a metonym for the primary presidential aircraft, VC-25, although it can be used to refer to any Air Force aircraft the president travels on. The idea of designating specific military aircraft to transport the president arose during World War II when military advisors in the War Department were concerned about the risk of using commercial airlines for presidential travel.
 
**[Boeing E-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_E-4)** 
 
 >The Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post (AACP), the current ""Nightwatch"" aircraft, is a strategic command and control military aircraft operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The E-4 series are specially modified from the Boeing 747-200B for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP) program. The E-4 serves as a survivable mobile command post for the National Command Authority, namely the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, and successors. The four E-4Bs are operated by the 1st Airborne Command and Control Squadron of the 595th Command and Control Group located at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska.

It's about what forces are prevailing within each country... and by extension world wide.  Just like we saw in the Cold War where communism and capitalist forces were at odds in a number of countries. (With different sides trying to give them an edge via manipulation)

There's examples from the CW where authoritarianism and democracy were just shiny veneers over those underlying view points. I mean how many times did the US ignore authoritarianism during the Cold War... because they played ball economically or allowed push back against Communism? (Remember the [Shah of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi)? [Park Chung-hee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee) of South Korea? [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek) from China/Taiwan? History is full of these examples )

For the most part you are right that it will likely come down to authoritarian backed nationalism or democratically based globalism... but there's going to be places where the economic realities the world will turn a blind eye. Which is why it really won't be about authoritarianism vs democracy (that will be part of how it's framed for the masses).  It's more about who's a good international partner versus who's not.

Exactly. He did it anyway. And was going to keep doing it. 

>These things seem symbolic but they really do matter. This could be a scenario where we don’t send 30 MIGs today to keep civilian attacks at the current level, or send 100+ planes and helicopters for support if Russia ramps up the violence. 

I don't think you understand what is happening here: there is no scenario, none, where Ukraine comes out of this unscathed. It's people are *going* to suffer horribly and there is nothing any of us can do about it. It isn't our fault Putin is bombing apartment blocks, it's his for being a megalomaniac. He did the same thing to Chechnya and Aleppo. Now pray tell, the fuck did the people of Aleppo do to him? 

Let him send whatever he wants into Ukraine. Hopefully they'll end up charred corpses along with all their friends. Thing is that's only going to happen if we give Ukraine jets. 

You have two choices: give Ukraine the means to win this war, or support a bloody and ruthless insurgency that will drag on for decades. 

I know you're about to mention some non-existent third option but keep in mind NATO is never, ever, going to let Putin win this. Ever. So it doesn't matter.

All I know is Russia has much more they can bring to bear and several prior examples of their brutality is the proof.

They may do that anyway but so far Russians have been holding back, they’re not just a third rate operation overall they just didn’t plan for the invasion to go this wrong and for Ukrainian resistance to be this strong.  Russian doctrine dictates that now they will establish supply chains and begin bombarding major cities until they submit or they’re gone.  That takes time but once they establish it, it will be brutal and difficult to stop.  30 jets won’t do it.  They will give him a justifiable excuse to the world though.

It’s possible there was some sort of collaborative effort for propagandizing purposes to damage Russia further. The letter seems convincing on the surface, and it seemed to be convincing enough to the supposed former or current FSB contacts of Grozev’s, but there are things that set off my own—as well as other people involved in security forces in Russia, aside from Grozev’s contacts—spidey senses just enough to be suspicious of why it would be written and its overall legitimacy.

Such as, the part about Kadyrov going nuts over Ukraine’s allegation that the FSB took out his own men—it *almost* seems out of place, as if it was really put in as some sort of secret, tongue-in-cheek inside joke.

I'm not cool with that sort of thing and I explicitly said so. I'm saying that you're looking at it through the lens of American domestic politics and ignoring the facts of the case. The reason why Trump was in a position to ""extort"" was because he dramatically increased US military spending to Ukraine - potentially escalating the military conflict (you can argue this made things worse, but I truly believe a true realist reading of the situation understands that once Euromaidan happened, invasion was not a matter of if but when). 

There is no argument that Trump left Ukraine ""unprepared"" for invasion, because the democrats likely would have supplied Ukraine with far less military aid. That's not an argument about the ethics of the Zelensky call, it's just a fact. You can choose to believe I'm a Trump supporter, but I genuinely am not, I think he had a pretty horrific foreign policy on the whole.
