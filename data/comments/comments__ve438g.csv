More on the Vasily Bekh tugboat now, which Ukraine's armed forces say they hit with missiles in the Black Sea today.

It's notable for a number of reasons, particularly because it is the first time Ukraine has claimed a hit using Harpoon anti-ship missiles supplied by the West.

The vessel had been transporting soldiers, weapons and ammunition to the Russian-occupied Snake Island, the Ukrainian navy said. 

The Russian Defence Ministry has not yet commented on the incident. 

Ukraine's defence minister said last month that Ukraine had started receiving Harpoon missiles from Denmark after cooperation between several countries. 

The missiles can be launched from air, land and sea, using active radar homing and flying just above the water to evade defences.

Ukraine's Armed Forces Strategic Communications Directorate said today's strike was the second time that anti-ship missiles had been used, referring to the earlier sinking of the Moskva warship.

""Both uses were successful. At the same time, the air defence of Russian ships proved to be entirely ineffective,"" they said.

Day 114 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today it was mostly quiet, I don’t think we were shelled even once, but they didn’t forget their usual missile strike from Belgorod at 11pm. This time they fired 6 or 7 missiles at us, no idea what was hit, but it was pretty loud, there was at least 1 apartment building that caught fire from it. 

It still feels so weird when you read about missiles being launched from Belgorod at the same exact time almost every day, and then within seconds from you reading it, air raid alert pops up, and you hear those missiles hit something nearby. Sometimes the missiles already hit something by the time alert pops up, because there’s at most a couple minutes of flight time from Belgorod to us, so the delay covers it.

Yesterday Russia fired a missile at Pisochyn, today they said that they destroyed an Azov HQ there, but there’s footage from the place of impact, and it’s just a crater in the middle of some random street, they damaged some buildings nearby, but none were destroyed. Apparently everything in Ukraine is actually just an Azov HQ, so anything they hit is a valid target, even that outhouse they destroyed with a missile in Odesa. Is their intel really this bad, or do they have people helping us by wasting expensive missiles?

Also that Putin’s speech was really disappointing, I thought he was going to announce the new world order, but he just said that unipolar world is over and that’s it, as if that means anything. Blaming the west for everything is Russia’s classic, but him saying that it’s everyone else who lives in the past is so funny, he literally wants to bring back Russian Empire, but apparently that’s very modern in his eyes? Everything they say is just the opposite of what they actually mean, how do they even do it, do they not get tired of lying?",False,1655517953.0,t3_ve438g,t3_ve438g,,0,91,0,91,1,0,

As Prime Minister Boris Johnson landed in Kyiv, it was revealed the UK plans to spearhead a programme to train thousands of Ukrainian soldiers. 

The operation could train up to 10,000 soldiers every 120 days and help Ukraine to accelerate deployment, rebuild forces and scale up the resistance against Russia.

Ukrainian troops would be trained outside of the country, if the offer is accepted by Ukraine. 

Mr Johnson said the plan would ""change the equation of this war"". 

""Two months on from my last visit, the Ukrainian grit, determination and resilience is stronger than ever, and I know that unbreakable resolve will long outlive the vain ambitions of President Putin,"" he said.

Over the last two days defence ministers from NATO countries and allies have been meeting in Brussels to discuss the war in the east - among them Ukraine's Oleksii Reznikov.

""I am proud that all the colleagues admire our soldiers and their valour,"" he said

""They understand that we are fighting not only for Ukraine, but also for a free Europe.""

While he didn't go into specifics, he says that the ""key message is that there will be supplies"" of ""high quality"".

""But not everything can be made public here and now. All will be later.""

Quoted in a Facebook post on the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine's official page, he spoke about what any weapons given to Ukraine will be used for.

Part of the hesitancy among Western nations to send heavy weapons - such as long-range rocket systems - has been down to concerns they could be used to strike targets in Russia.

Mr Reznikov said: ""Ukraine does not intend to use weapons to attack Russia or seize its territories. 

""We don’t need things that don’t belong to us. We protect our own: the lives of our people and our land. 

""We are liberating free Ukraine from the Russian invasion.""

Some more now from President Putin, who's been speaking today at an economic forum in the city of St Petersburg.

The Russian leader insists he has nothing against Ukraine joining the European Union; objecting only to ""military utilisation"" of its territory.

His remarks come after the European Commission - the EU body responsible for drafting laws - recommended that Ukraine be made an official candidate country for accession.

Earlier, Putin made a variety of attacks on the EU, including a claim that its sanctions targeting Russia had backfired.

Italy’s Eni says it will receive only half of the gas supply volumes it had requested from Russia’s Gazprom on Friday after experiencing a shortfall in the two previous days.

“Against a daily gas demand by Eni of around 63 million cubic meters, Gazprom announced that it will only supply 50 percent of what was requested, with actual quantities delivered almost unchanged from yesterday,” the energy giant said on its website.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that reductions in supply were not premeditated and were related to maintenance issues, but Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi dismissed his explanation.

“Both Germany and us, and others, believe these are lies. In reality they are making a political use of gas like they are using grain for political use,” Draghi told a news conference during a visit to Kyiv with his German and French counterparts.

Speaking at a joint news conference in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Boris Johnson has pledged his continued support for Ukraine.

The UK has just offered to provide help with training thousands of Ukrainian soldiers amid the conflict - and the prime minister said the aim is to help Ukraine push Russian forces out of the country.

""We will continue, as we have from the beginning, to provide the military equipment you need - and now, of course, the training that may be necessary to go with that new equipment - so that you, the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian armed forces, will be able to do what I believe Ukrainians yearn to do, and that is to expel the aggressor from Ukraine,"" he said.

""That will be the moment for talks about the future of Ukraine and it will be in that context of a free Ukraine that we and other countries will be making the security commitments and guarantees we have discussed so often.""

He said there is ""evidence"" Russian troops are under ""acute pressure"" and are taking ""heavy casualties"". 

""Their expenditure of munitions - of shells and other weaponry - is colossal. After 114 days of attack on Ukraine, they have still not achieved the objectives they set out for the first week,"" he said.

""We are here once again to underline that we are with you to give you the strategic endurance that you will need and we are going to help to continue to intensify the sanctions on Putin's regime.""

The prime minister added that he understood why Ukraine cannot ""compromise"" with Russia.

An international expert helping Ukraine investigate alleged war crimes has said there are all the “hallmarks of a chain of command” linking reported atrocities committed on the ground during the conflict to Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.

“With the noises and rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, with the obvious correspondence between what’s being said by the Kremlin and what’s happening on the ground, you’ve got all the hallmarks of a chain of command from the ground crimes to Putin himself,” British lawyer Wayne Jordash, who is coordinating mobile justice teams that will assist the Ukrainian investigators, said during a visit to a village near Kyiv.

Jordash and others were visiting Bohdanivka, which sits about 50 kilometres (30 miles) northeast of the Ukrainian capital, where they toured a burned-out school and a kindergarten and houses that were reduced to rubble when Russian troops pulled back from the area in early April.

Russia denies its forces have carried out war crimes during its self-described “special military operation”, which it claims is aimed at disarming and “denazify” its neighbour. Kyiv and its allies argue the invasion is an unprovoked war of aggression.

Details: Ukrainians trying to leave Russian-occupied cities cannot do so without going through a process called ""filtration.""
  
People have their phones confiscated, and their social media accounts examined; they are undressed, their bodies are examined carefully, tattoos are checked, and the occupiers look for bruises on their shoulders and fingers that may suggest the recent use of weapons.
  
Anything that seems suspicious to inspectors can lead to beatings or even electric shocks, civilians say. Many are forcibly sent to Russia.
  
One man said that he deleted all the files from his phone, although the occupiers then tried to recover them using a computer. However, he said that he did not have time to ""clean up"" his social media – the internet was cut off in Mariupol. They found a video on his Instagram where he’d written: ""A president we can be proud of. Go home with your warship!"" For that, he was beaten. 
  
Another Ukrainian, a history teacher, was found with the word ""Ruscist"" on his phone – he was beaten and kicked. He was then labelled as a person who spreads pro-Ukrainian propaganda, and asked about the ""events of 2014"" when Russia occupied Crimea and started the war in Donbas. He was asked if he agreed that it was ""a Ukrainian civil war"", then they found a photo of a book cover with the letter ""H"" in its title and thought it was about Hitler.  

After that, the teacher was transferred to a prison, where he counted 24 people in a cell with four bunk beds. A couple of days later, he was released into Ukrainian-controlled territory.  

Another man saw people with their hands tied behind their backs being beaten in an interrogation tent in Bezimenne, a small village to the east of Mariupol.  
People report that soldiers are torturing Ukrainians to the point of unconsciousness with severe blows and electric shocks. Many are released only if they agree to head for Russia.  

There is another room in the filtration camp, which is called a ""cage."" People there received no water or food, and had to urinate in the corner, in front of everyone.

Continuing with President Putin's speech in St Petersburg.

Referring to fears of a global food crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, he claims Russia is capable of significantly increasing its exports of grain and fertilisers.

Grain exports alone could rise to some 50 million tonnes, he says.

Ukraine is one of the world's top grain producers along with Russia, but has been unable to send supplies abroad due to a blockade of its ports.

This is likely true, Russia has expended an immense amount of its modernized arsenal (which we now know wasn't even that good) to fight a war that at best, it can hope to maybe hold on to what it's already taken. It could double down, but in reality these losses will likely take decades or more to replenish for Russia, if at all.

The Russian industry isn't capable of making the modern tanks the soviet union was, and definitely not in the same quantity. Despite the T-14 being ""the best tank in the world"" it hasn't been seen in Ukraine and there is like what, 10 that we know exist and drive around? It might as well not exist, Russia could probably not even build many more T-72s or T-90s if it wanted to.

Russia handed the US a major W, basically guaranteeing that it will never be able to do something like this again and now because of the sunk cost fallacy Putin doesn't want to leave, hes already spent too much he needs to double down on his gamble. That will likely just be another W for the US. They already lost 20-30% of there entire armies armored force (not just the invasion force, all of their military).

France has not received any natural gas from Russia via pipeline since June 15, network operator GRTgaz says, after Russian energy giant Gazprom warned this week it would sharply cut deliveries to Europe.

Gazprom said the supply reductions via the Nord Stream pipeline are the result of repair work, but EU officials believe Moscow is punishing allies of Ukraine.

France gets around 17 percent of its gas from Russia through network connections with Germany, which relies heavily on Russian supplies and has criticised Gazprom’s move as “political”. Supplies had already been reduced by 60 percent since the beginning of this year, sending prices soaring.

But GRTgaz said there was no risk to French supplies currently, with reserves at 56 percent capacity compared with 50 percent in June normally.

French President Emmanuel Macron says he is open to talking to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin as part of efforts to strike a deal to get grain out of the Ukrainian port of Odesa but that he sees little chance of an agreement.

“We have to talk with Russia on food security and it (discussions) can be justified by liaising directly with the UN secretary general to get grains out of Odesa,” Macron told BFM TV on his way back from Ukraine.

“But I don’t believe a lot in this path, because I already had talks a few weeks ago with President Putin, but he didn’t want to accept a UN resolution on this subject.”

If a major war kicked off with out nukes, NATO v Russia, the war would be an absolute slaughter for the Russians, they know that as well. But the people of Russia believe their military is basically as good as the US, or pretty close at least. Maybe even better in some departments, like motivation or the # of tanks they have. 

Russia's economy is tiny though, with a GDP of 1.43 trillion Russia simply cannot maintain a large modern force, definitely not enough to challenge NATO in a head on war.

Declaration of mobilization on May 9th was the right move, which is why many intelligence communities predicted it would happen.

Funny of him saying this considering how they treat Ukraine. Other than that I think it's funny he goes with the ""Europe is forced against their will in this"". Fuck you I wish we did more.

Also I love the ""whew we survived the sanctions by killing our stock market and putting our currency in an artificial limbo"" when his own economic minister says the real pain begins in the fall.

>“Currently this problem might not be as acute because the economy still has inventories, but we can see that the sanctions are being tightened almost every day,” Nabiullina added, predicting there was no way of telling how long this will potentially last.  
>  
>“Already in the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter, we will actively enter a period of structural transformation and the search for new business models for many enterprises.”  
>  
>Translation: Russian companies haven’t even begun to feel the pain.

And West has effectively inserted itself in a way that a Ukraine loss will undoubtedly be counted as a Russia win over the west and NATO. They will be extremely emboldened and have a lot of respect by a lot of countries. Not to mention, nobody will have any more appetite for helping the next country on their list the same way Ukraine is being helped and supported. 

Conversely, a Russian defeat would completely and utterly undermine Russia as a superpower and nobody will be taking it seriously anymore. It will lose the allies it has and business will be fucked. No more demand for Migs or Sus over Western jets. 

Which brings us to the interesting yet quite frankly terrifying question of how far will either side go and how much will be lost by the end of all this? 

See my theory is simple. I think Putin had his golden opportunity and it came and went in the initial days of the war. Ukraine had support but not quite as much as it is today. Russia could have bombarded Kiev back to stoneage along with most of Ukraine. But it did not. And now Ukraine has enough support in hand and incoming to resist and fuck knows what we aren't aware of or what is in the near future. 

On the flip side, the support for the war is starting to wane in small numbers in the US. We have mid terms coming up and in true democratic fashion, the House could flip by December 2022 costing Biden a lot of power and influence. If this war is not wrapped up in the next month or two, the support will continue to drop and there will come a point where it will be actually unpopular. And if Republicans take the House, that would just seal the deal because the Trump party will be following the Trump doctrine and saying it is very expensive to be NATO member and USA has to do most of the heavy lifting and spend the most money etc etc and fucking etc. 

If USA is not able to support Ukraine as it is doing right now, Ukraine is put in pretty bad shape because nobody in Europe can match USA's support in weapons or money. 

I am just analyzing the political eventualities here and I may be quite wrong on some things or all of them. So for me, the next couple of months could change the trajectory of this war completely.

average citizen knows what a tank is and what a fighter jet is. and they know they're expensive.  and they can always use it to refute Putin when he goes off the rails complaining about western escalation

it's also crap.  plenty of the toys sent to ukraine have just as much individual destructive power as fighter jets or tanks, if not more, and have been sent in vast numbers.

its ridiculous to think they aren't necessary. the ukrainian air force has repeatedly proven its worth and any additional assets it could field would certainly have an impact on the battlefield.  There's very little a MiG 29 or F16 can do that an S300, Harpoon or MRLS/Artillery cannot.  The Poland transfer sounded like a win-win-win (for ukraine/poland/the US); though it sounds like it might have been partially done on the down low.  I've said on many occasions that I hope ukrainian pilots are training on F16s at this very moment.  The F16s ground attack capability could really make a difference in the fight as it stands.

Tanks are a slightly different story. Ukraine already has received several hundred, which is factually one of the world's largest tank forces.  Realistically, modern western tanks are much, much more complicated than the ones ukraine is used to, and have much more sensitive technology in them that no one wants in russian hands.  if the russians were to kill an Abrams (and they would, eventually), it'd be a bad look.  Given where the war is - we're seeing less and less maneuver warfare, I honestly don't think Ukraine could ask for a whole lot more right now (they can and shoot continue to ask, of course, i just don't think its the current priority)

a lot of this is moot: almost all of europe could not send fighters if it wanted to... all their forces are laughably / embarrassingly small and it'd take a decade to replenish even a few dozen, even if you ignore the training & logistics issues.  Most western countries have tiny inventories of their latest Dassault / Eurofighter / SAAB / F35; nothing they can give or even sell away.  

The only countries that could actually donate fighters are eastern european countries with MiG 29, MiG-21, Su-24, and Su-25 excess stock, and the United States with early block F16s and legacy Marine F-18A/B hornets (of which there are quite a few).",False,1655476045.0,t3_ve438g,t1_icp04dh,,2,3,0,3,0,0,

Not really though. There's a difference between defense of Ukraine and war with Russia. NATO wants to prevent Russia from taking over Ukraine, and thus arms Ukraine with weapons essential for territorial defense. NATO doesn't want to go to war with Russia, thus excludes weapons which can be used to strike deep into Russia.

I'm going to use the US as an example, because it's where I'm from. Let's say the US believed the drug cartels had corrupted the Mexican government to an unacceptable state and launched an invasion to 'liberate' Mexico. Russia sides with the cartels and arms Mexico with APCs and artillery. Unexpectedly, Russia gives Mexico a bunch of SU-57s (4.5 gen fighters) and Medium Range Ballistic Missiles (MRBMs) with a range of 2,500km. Mexico starts indiscriminately bombing Washington DC, New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, etc... The US would see that as a massive escalation by Russia and would respond by attacking Russia proper. It would unquestionably be all out war with Russia.

So that's what's at risk with Ukraine. Give them too much advanced weaponry, and they bomb the fuck out of Moscow. All of a sudden Russia starts bombing NATO cities and it's a massive war. So, NATO is giving Ukraine enough weapons to severely punish Russia while they're in Ukraine but leaving Russian territory safe for them to withdraw to.

Winner winner chicken dinner.

Russia is depleting its limited resources over a chunk of land that they pretty well already controlled. I think if the Ukrainians (God bless their souls) had a more difficult time pushing russia out of the western portions, things would be different.

Donbass has been in a ""civil war"" (I put quotations because now Im questioning everything I thought was fact) since 2014. 

Russia tried to take the whole country. Instead, they are going to wind up with less influence then pre feb and a depleted military. 

Plus, as much as I love Ukraine and the Ukranian people right now, ""we"" (collective west) can't be sending our cutting edge tech that way, some will without a doubt wind up in the wrong hands and end up in China being reverse engineered.

As you mentioned, and I agree with, China is waiting to play, so the coming months are going to be very, very interesting to watch.

Im waiting for Russia to be supplied with Chinese arms, if they haven't already, once they ""run out""

Basically, we've let our ability to do 152mm stuff rot, as it seemed like the Baltics were migrating towards modern Western gear and continued investment in tooling and production of 152mm stockpiles that were unlikely to be used seemed unjustified.

This is a war between two peer powers, and Ukraine will take losses. That includes western supplied heavy weapons. Just because a weapon system doesn't survive until the end of the war doesn't mean it won't have an impact on the battlefield and ultimately the outcome of the war.  


attriting faster than stockpiles NATO is willing to supply to Ukraine, Ukraine will win the war.

* US/NATO should have fostered a little more 152mm production capability, because even within NATO we're not transitioning away from it as quickly as thought, and the need to support non-NATO states with primarily 152mm capabilities is more important than previously thought.
* Both the panicked production of 152mm and the ramp of 155mm artillery gifts should have started a bit sooner.

It is not necessarily that a Russian man cannot fight like a Ukrainian.  They are not fighting for their homes.  The Russians are not volunteers.  To a much larger extent Ukrainian infantry are now experienced with tactics that work despite a artillery disadvantage.  If it (whatever ""it"" is) was not working Ukraine would not be advancing.  A drop in Russian ammunition leverages Ukraine's advantage.
