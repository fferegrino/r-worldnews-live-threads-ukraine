I will say in russian. The man from the Kremlin is very afraid and probably hiding somewhere. I am sure that he is no longer in Moscow. He knows what he is afraid of because he himself created this threat. The longer he can run between his bunkers, the more you all will lose... all who are connected with Russia.

What will we, Ukrainians, do?
We will defend our country. We know how to win – and it will happen.

And what will you do?
The longer your troops stay on Ukrainian land, the more devastation they will bring to Russia. The longer this person is in the Kremlin, the more disasters there will be.""

Criticism of the military is illegal but Putin blocked prosecution because he liked being able to use Prigozhin as a mouthpiece to criticize commanders while keeping his own hands clean. Losses in the military are unpopular but Putin used Wagner to lose men off the books. The military establishment always hated Wagner because Wagner existed only to undercut them and their influence. They’ve wanted to cull them forever but Putin refused to let them because he felt it would give them too much influence and he wanted a counterbalance.

Putin specifically invited the wolf to the fireside and he specifically overruled everyone else who said it was a bad idea. He insisted that he could place a leash on the wolf and planned to use the wolf to intimidate his rivals.

And, of course, Prigozhin also gets his wish to see Shoigu removed, who he's been complaining about forever. 

Even without a coup/battle taking place, this is a massive shift in the balance of power in Russia and a huge blow to the perceived strength of the Putin administration and its control over the military. Wagner, a private military contractor, marched to the gates basically unopposed and got what they wanted, uncontested, and are now far more instrumental in directly controlling policy.

Wagner is angry as fuck. Literally announce a coup, something thats strange to announce openly in itself. 

Ask military to step down and join them. 

Shoots down a bunch of helicopters and a oil depot. Move tanks, other armor, 25k men, all the way up to Moscow. 

Withdraw soldiers from the occupied areas in Ukraine to join them.

Have some talks with Lukashenko, which isnt even the Shoigu or Putin, and suddenly something they talks about, makes them question the coup.

Nah, blod might be shed, we go back. No worries people, nothing happened here.

In addition, Wagner met no resistance all the way from the border up to the capital.

>  
>The recent events have sparked contemplation on whether Prigozhin will endure the aftermath or succumb to its consequences. However, there is no doubt that this rebellion carries far-reaching implications.  
>  
>From both external and internal perspectives, Putin's image has weakened, reminiscent of the Japanese emperor during the Sengoku period. Similar to a symbolic figure, the emperor held nominal power while warring samurai clans vied for control over Japan.  
>  
>Though Putin still wields undeniable power, it is evident that he has lost control over the situation, resulting in a significant crack in his perceived ability to exert authority and manage internal affairs. Additionally, Putin had to rely on the intervention of a foreign leader (Belarus) to resolve the internal conflict.  
>  
>These events highlight the potential use of military force against Putin's government as a means to coerce acceptance of terms, although the details of the arrangement between Prigozhin and Putin-Lukashenko remain undisclosed. If a replacement occurs within the top military command, it would only reinforce such behavior.  
>  
>Furthermore, this upheaval exposes the inherent weakness within the system itself. Numerous senior officers responsible for decision-making chose to abstain from issuing orders or making decisive moves, opting to wait for the outcome.  
>  
>The relatively swift movement of Wagner forces from Ukraine to Moscow within a span of less than a day, coupled with the chaotic attempts to destroy bridges and hastily dig ditches near Moscow, have laid bare the unpreparedness of the system to face a genuine threat.  
>  
>It has been intriguing to witness the involvement of various groups, including the Club of Angered Patriots led by Strelkov, the Rusich neo-Nazi military unit, and the Kadyrovites, aligning themselves with different factions within the conflict. This development reveals a landscape that hints at the potential for a future civil war,

>While the immediate repercussions of the current events will become apparent in the coming weeks, it is crucial to recognize that we are merely at the inception of something far more significant. The unfolding situation carries profound implications that extend beyond the present moment.

Putin just surrendered to Prigozhin. Putin went on TV and basically called Prigozhin a traitor, and that he would be punished. He wouldn't have done all that if he was planning to give in to pretty much every one of Prigozhin demands. He looks weak after all of this.

As i've said in previous threads, and others have said it as well, Prigozhin started this because the Russian MoD was planning to take all his influence away from him, with the move to get PMC fighters sign contracts with the Russian MoD by July 1st. It was basically do something or die for Prigozhin, and he decided to gamble everything in  a last ditch ""coup"".  That somehow ""worked?""

The recent events have sparked contemplation on whether Prigozhin will endure the aftermath or succumb to its consequences. However, there is no doubt that this rebellion carries far-reaching implications.

From both external and internal perspectives, Putin's image has weakened, reminiscent of the Japanese emperor during the Sengoku period. Similar to a symbolic figure, the emperor held nominal power while warring samurai clans vied for control over Japan.

Though Putin still wields undeniable power, it is evident that he has lost control over the situation, resulting in a significant crack in his perceived ability to exert authority and manage internal affairs. Additionally, Putin had to rely on the intervention of a foreign leader (Belarus) to resolve the internal conflict.

These events highlight the potential use of military force against Putin's government as a means to coerce acceptance of terms, although the details of the arrangement between Prigozhin and Putin-Lukashenko remain undisclosed. If a replacement occurs within the top military command, it would only reinforce such behavior.

Furthermore, this upheaval exposes the inherent weakness within the system itself. Numerous senior officers responsible for decision-making chose to abstain from issuing orders or making decisive moves, opting to wait for the outcome.

The relatively swift movement of Wagner forces from Ukraine to Moscow within a span of less than a day, coupled with the chaotic attempts to destroy bridges and hastily dig ditches near Moscow, have laid bare the unpreparedness of the system to face a genuine threat. 

It has been intriguing to witness the involvement of various groups, including the Club of Angered Patriots led by Strelkov, the Rusich neo-Nazi military unit, and the Kadyrovites, aligning themselves with different factions within the conflict. This development reveals a landscape that hints at the potential for a future civil war,

While the immediate repercussions of the current events will become apparent in the coming weeks, it is crucial to recognize that we are merely at the inception of something far more significant. The unfolding situation carries profound implications that extend beyond the present moment.

What kicked off the whole thing wasn't Russia's failure on the battlefield but the fact that the Russian army planned to confiscate and dismantle ALL PMC groups and integrate them into the Russian army. Aka the Russian government was planning a communist style nationalization of Prigodzin's private property the Wagner PMC. He even said so in his message justifying the retreat from Moscow

[https://targum.video/v/2023/6/24/6159b770af72ed25fae73473bdd826f7/](https://targum.video/v/2023/6/24/6159b770af72ed25fae73473bdd826f7/)

>The Wagner PMC was about to be disbanded. We went out on June 23rd for a march of justice. We've been through 24 hours,

The big problem for Prigodzin if Wagner gets taken away from him is two fold

1. It's his main if not only source of income atm
2. Given the conflicts he has created with the Russian MOD without the 50k wagner soldiers to protect him he is dead cause the Russian Mod would most likely try and smoke him.

Prigodzin's only chance of staying alive was to prevent the confiscation of Wagner and this was what this was all about. He scared Putin a bit and now he was bough some time. Putin has kinda won this battle though because the coupists need to finish the dictator quick in order to succeed him and Putin will most likely try to off Prigdozin anyway but for now both men got what they wanted: Putin avoided a costly civil war and Prigodzin gets to keep Wagner and live another day.

What's going to happen next is slightly more unclear. THe slightly more probable scenario is that both Putin and Prigodzin will try to avoid smoking each other at least until the end of the Ukraine war. Nevertheless as Putin is a dictator he might try and make a move on Prigodzin sooner and overall if given time the Russian government has more resources than the Wagners. Prigodzin will either try to find a country to flee too or might start recruiting and preparing for a second real coup attempt. Most likely he might try and recruit disgruntled elements of the Russian army to see if he can stage a big coup because he knows he won't be safe until the end of his life. Prigodzin did say in his message that they are going back to their camps and that means he is planning to stay next to the war zone most likely to recruit people given the fact that Wagner doesn't have any active contracts with the RUssian MOD.",1687634088.0,1687634025.0,t3_14hxs7o,t3_14hxs7o,,0,46,0,46,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-06-24-23/index.html

""United States intelligence officials believe Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin had been planning a major challenge to Russia’s military leadership for quite some time, three people familiar with the matter tell CNN — but it was unclear what the ultimate aim would be.

Intelligence officials briefed congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight earlier this week concerning Wagner movements and equipment buildups near Russia, two of the people said.

US and Western intelligence officials saw signs Prigozhin was making preparations for such a move, including by massing weapons and ammunition, one western intelligence official and another person familiar with the intelligence said.

The official said they believe Prigozhin’s claims of an ammunition shortage for operations in Ukraine was deliberate deception, to help lay the groundwork for a potential military challenge to Russian leaders.

A source familiar with the intelligence said “it all happened very quickly,” and it was difficult to discern how serious Prigozhin was about threatening the Russian military and where he would take his troops.

As CNN has previously reported, US officials were caught off guard by the speed with which the situation unfolded Friday night and escalated into Saturday, causing senior officials to cancel planned international trips and convene emergency meetings across the government.""",False,1687631931.0,t3_14hxs7o,t3_14hxs7o,,0,18,0,18,0,0,

Here's a guy who started out getting imprisoned for theft as the Soviet Union rotted and ultimately fell. After getting released he starts out with a kiosk, or a hot dog stand, becomes successful and gets his dirty hands into many different businesses before settling for fancy restaurants that catch Putin's attention who makes him his caterer.

He becomes rich, and starts a maniacal mercenary group to help Russia in 2014 in Ukraine. This group is successful, they're brutal, crazy psychopaths that nobody wants to fight, and have raped and pillaged their way through Africa and Syria in the years since.

The war in Ukraine provides another opportunity to rise higher in the ranks of the oligarchical oil mafia state. And he's only one of a few 'leaders' up there at the frontlines, together with his maniacs, gaining him popularity. As the war progresses, he sees the writing on the wall, there is no way for Russia to win this war with the incompetent fools at the helm.

So he makes a 'pitch' by capturing Bakhmut as an example, and making a public plea to Putin to get rid of the current crop like Shoigu and make him the leader of the army instead. He says he'd win the war immediately, and because of his popularity most soldiers on the front would support that.

But Putin remains silent, and Shoigu and the rest make plans to get rid of him instead. But they forgot they created a monster, a rabid dog without a leash that has smelled blood and is smart enough to understand that he's strong enough to seize the ultimate price for himself, to become the top dog.

He's been branded a traitor and domestic terrorist by Putin and his media. Now Putin will get the army to easier surround him. What's Prigozhin going to do or what's his plan? Especially with stopping? He in my eyes needed to get the capital, as it would be a very public image of his power, authority, and influence towards the people and other army groups to have a rebellion or regime change/coup.

Reports say he has 25k troops, and an expert on BBC said he might have that total worldwide, but a lot of Wagner troops are in Africa right now, so maybe he has about 10k in Russia, and not all of them will be with him on this campaign in what was towards Moscow.


Prigozhin was never going to last. By taking Moscow he at least has a chance for survival, but the most likely outcome is nothing much else happens in regards to regime change, and Putin quickly surrounds Prigozhin (since Putin has hundreds of thousands of troops apparently) and easily defeat Prigozhin in the bigger picture.

But if Prigozhin is stopping his advance towards Moscow, then what? He's got nothing and can't do anything, except be surrounded quicker and easier. He has to move FAST. Behind him are annoyed Russian troops on the frontline in Ukraine, and elsewhere are Russian soldiers probably advancing towards him, and air support will be organizing against him.

Putin can't go back on branding him a traitor, and there's already been conflicts between Wagner and Russian troops. Prigozhin could have already pulled out with Wagner instead of going for a coup/""to get Shoigu"" so what's he trying for here?

Does Prigozhin really think he can get concessions and things will go back to how they were? Either concessions will be a ploy by Putin and he'll just steamroll his army when he can, or he will give him concessions and then assassinate him later. But i can't see Putin handing over Shoigu, and that's what Prigozhin specifically asked for. Prigozhin will look weak if hardly anything happens, and he's forced back to the place he has called a meat-grinder. Putin would also look weak if he gave him any kind of genuine concessions.

2. It was a coordinated ploy to see who was really faithful to Putin and who was not. From reports of border guards and military standing aside and letting Wagner pass through unopposed to the reaction by other politicians within Russia and their international allies, this may have been a way to draw out those who would turn their back on Putin. Maybe Putin reasoned the loss of a few men, equipment and an oil facility was worth it?

* 0% chance Lukashenko would be the one to successfully mediate here. It would be between Putin and Prigozhin

It's either:

1. There WAS a legitimate peace deal between warring factions. Prigozhin thinks he'll be safe and considered a hero for exposing weaknesses in MoD. And his entire goal was to replace Shoigu/Gerasimov and improve Russia's attack on Ukraine. This means Prigozhin legitimately got cold feet over the course of a few hours. I'm leaning towards this.
2. Months long coordination between Moscow and Wagner for an elaborate red herring to expose some Ukrainian offensive hand, which Russia would theoretically punish. This makes no sense because there is nothing forcing Ukraine to ""fall"" for the red herring, and the more logical response for Ukraine, which they did, is to wait and watch.

Putin’s Chef leads the Wagner group. Close allies. And, despite the calls for a March on Moscow and usurping of military power, he never once made an ill statement against his friend Putin. Instead, statements were made that only one politician would be able to save the war but that the people lying to him had to go. 


Who did Wagner threaten directly via statements? Shoigu. Who has been allegedly arrested by Putin? Shoigu. Who will take the fall for this disaster of an invasion? **Shoigu.**


Conspiracies don’t need right cooperation. People play off each other. I get the feeling that is what happened here. Would Putin acknowledge that he fucked up with Shoigu? Probably not. The dude had been starving Wagner for months. 


So Prigozhin gave him an excuse by scapegoating Shoigu. Putin appears to have acted on it. After all, who failed to stop an invasion of Russia with city annexation nearly all the way to Moscow? Shoigu.

Chief of the Russian mercenary group Wagner has told his troops to abandon their march on Moscow to ""avoid bloodshed""

Yevgeny Prigozhin told his forces to return to their bases after negotiations with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, according to Russian TV channel Rossiya 24

BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says Lukashenko's deal means it is ""one-nil to President Putin"".

He says Yevgeny Prigozhin expected people to ""rise up and join him"" but that did not happen.

Putin is ""not somebody who's going to forgive this"", Gardner says.

""I think Prigozhin's military and political future must now be over.""

Gardner added it was ""deeply embarrassing"" for Putin that Prigozhin was able to cross the border and take Russian Southern District military headquarters Rostov-On-Don with nobody opposing him.",False,1687633809.0,t3_14hxs7o,t3_14hxs7o,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

I think there are no direct ramifications for the war itself. I think Wagner as well as the Kadyrovites were designated reserve troops for fending off the Ukrainian counter-offensive. That is why they were free to go on this wild goose chase in the first place. So this changed nothing at the actual front lines with regards to current strength on both sides.

It's disappointing that it ended so soon. There are nevertheless some mid-term ramifications.

Firstly it seems like a significant portion of the Wagner forces are free to leave Ukraine and Russia. This means that the combat strength of Russian forces will be diminished in the near future.

Secondly this event might force Putin to re-think the security of his home front. I think there was not much military force to stop Wagner from taking the capital. This combined with the recent incursions by ""Free Russian Troops"" might force Putin to re-deploy some of his Ukraine based combat troops to Russia.

Thirdly Putin has been unmasked as weak and scared. This is fuel for the fire. We are still witnessing the destabilization of Russia. This was just one episode, albeit a dramatic one. The power struggles will go on. A lot of people will be very pissed about the situation and ask themselves if Putin is still the man. A future without Putin now seems not only possible, but we all have seen that his power has become fragile. There is blood in the water.

Pringles though, I don't know. I explain this to myself that he is a business man in the first place. He felt that his business empire was in grave danger by the threatened nationalization of his mercenary force. So maybe he was seeing a way out for his and his troops, to return plundering and mutilating Africa, and retain his independence.

Do we know if their Columns are from all the way down the M4 at the Front?

Edit: For the folks pointing out about distance, time and speed limits: Good intel, But I'm wondering how they didn't like... get stuck in a traffic jam, or a few under informed army/police personnel setting up a roadblock, getting blown up and the Column getting delayed as it was cleared. 

I am deeply underinformed on the conditions on the ground, But such  sudden movments of personel often need a LOT of planning, and from what i've been told so far all the lads in Wagner are just so damn loyal and effective at breaking camp that they broke camp and sprinted up the country's spine. 

I guess I am trying to articulate some questions that are forming. Badly.

I know how insane that sounds and like I said I don't believe it, but I do think it would explain the situation if Putin died Thursday evening or Friday morning.

I asked it to elaborate on what the motivation might be if that were the case and it gave me this (I get it, and I don't blame you for the downvotes):

If the events unfolding are indeed a form of strategic deception, the potential goals could be numerous and depend on the internal and external pressures facing the Russian government. Some possible motives could include:

Diversion from the War in Ukraine: The Russian government may want to divert attention away from the poorly handled war in Ukraine, both domestically and internationally. This manufactured crisis may serve as a compelling distraction and could allow them to regroup or change their approach in Ukraine.

Consolidation of Power: By creating a crisis, the leadership may be attempting to rally the populace around a common enemy, fostering a sense of national unity in the face of adversity. This could bolster Putin's support even further and allow him to consolidate his grip on power.

Justification for Policy Shifts: If Russia is looking to enact major policy changes—be it military, economic, or foreign policy—that would normally face resistance, this crisis could provide the needed cover or justification. In the face of a perceived ""traitor"" like Prigozhin, previously unacceptable actions might be deemed necessary for the safety and security of the nation.

International Diplomacy: The crisis could serve as a tool to gauge or manipulate the reactions of international allies, adversaries, and neutrals. Depending on responses, Russia could justify shifts in alliances, treaty obligations, or even military postures. This could also be a way to test the West's reaction to potential internal instability in Russia.

Internal Purges or Reorganizations: This situation might be a cover for an internal purge of officials who are considered disloyal or inefficient. It could allow for a reorganization of the military or political structure under the guise of a crisis.

Testing Loyalties: This could be a way for Putin to test the loyalty of his military, security forces, or even regional leaders. By seeing who would support Prigozhin and who would remain loyal to the Kremlin, Putin can identify potential threats or allies.

All these possibilities rely on the assumption that Putin, Prigozhin, and potentially other high-ranking officials are coordinating to deceive the public, and possibly even elements within their own government and military. Such a plan would require meticulous planning and execution, as well as a readiness to manage potential unforeseen consequences.",1687636425.0,1687636058.0,t3_14hxs7o,t3_14hxs7o,,0,-5,0,-5,0,0,

People thinking that Moscow will fall to Wagner are wayyyyy too optimistic.

Even if Wagner was reinforced by some defectors from the Russian army (Let's say they, super optimistically, grew their forces to 70 000), Moscow remains a huge city of 12 millions.

Let's not forget that even with a complete assault from multiple sides, Russia wasn't even close to conquering Kyiv, which 'only' houses a bit under 3 millions inhabitants.

However, it'll still depend on the fervor of Putin's loyalists. If they back him 100%, there is 0 chance for Wagner to even come close to inflicting real damage to the capital.

And I think that the moment Wagner sees they've reached an impasse, they'll pull back and start to consolidate their gains instead of risking it all on a move that has realistically no chance of success.

Edit : Didn't realize this'd be unpopular :') Anyway, I stand by what I said. I highly doubt that Putin suddenly lost all support overnight in Moscow, meaning that I expect a decently motivated armed defense of the capital. If Wagner really pulls it off, I'll eat my hat though",1687626756.0,1687625946.0,t3_14hxs7o,t3_14hxs7o,,0,-17,0,-17,0,0,

458358bf10b8dd9d1761e4592b1ace24,14hxs7o,jpdgw3v,"Here's my thinking: Prigozhin is the man behind the Internet Research Agency, i.e. essentially the top dog when it comes to Russian disinformation in recent years. 

He already appears to have used disinformation in the Ukraine conflict in recent times - like when he made the announcement that his troops were pulling out, only for them not to do so - perhaps with the aim of baiting Ukraine into thinking they would face less resistance on certain fronts, causing them to over-extend, thereby weakening the counter-offensive.

From what Prigozhin himself said, his reasons for going against the Russian Ministry of Defence are 1) misappropriated funds and corruption leading to them being under-supplied and lacking the necessary ammunition to continue fighting, and 2) that Russian military forces shelled Wagner positions, killing some of his men.

As far as I'm aware, no evidence came out supporting #2, and as for #1, there's evidence that Prigozhin was stock-piling ammunition and supplies for years himself, making his claims about a lack of ammunition somewhat doubtful. 

Now we do know that Wagner and the MoD have been somewhat at odds with each other, so it's plausible that these shaky reasons were just part of that ongoing feud, but it would also be pretty on brand for it to be a diversion and more of Prigozhin's information warfare - with Ukraine and allies being the target of the disinformation. 

After all, why was Wagner simply able to walk through the Russian military divisions to its rear? Why was the only ""resistance"" we've seen to their advances within Russia itself a couple of videos seemingly showing a burning vehicle or two. In this most well-documented war with tons of mobile phone & go-pro footage, why do we have zero footage of the alleged fighting that supposedly broke out between Wagner and regular Russian troops along their advance?

I think it's highly possible that this entire thing was intended either to a) bait Ukraine into changing up their counter-offensive plans - for example: attacking too early, over-extending, or changing up the locations they decide to focus their troops on, b) to move large amounts of Wagner and Russian military forces to a different staging point (perhaps the Eastern border, or the Northern border between Ukraine and Belarus) without it being obvious that the troops are being moved there for a fresh attack (or with it being realised too late for Ukrainian troops to move into defensive positions), or c) both.

It's literally one of the most over-quoted segments from Sun Tzu's The Art of War: “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak”

It is Russia though, so it's entirely possible it *was* just more internal strife and quarrelling, undertaken by Prigozhin to make certain demands of Putin.

[Scene: The Kremlin's Situation Room. Tension fills the air as leaders discuss the imminent coup in Russia. Vladimir Putin, Lukashenko, and Prigozhin are present, each wearing a serious expression.]

Putin: (firmly) We cannot allow this coup to succeed. Our nation's stability is at stake.

Lukashenko: (thoughtfully) Maybe there's a way to diffuse the situation peacefully.

Prigozhin: (agitated) Peaceful? Putin must be removed for the sake of our country!

[Enter a delivery person holding a tray with a Snickers bar.]

Delivery Person: (cheerfully) Special delivery! A Snickers for each of you.

Putin: (curiously) What's this about?

Lukashenko: (smiling) It's a snack that might just help us find common ground.

[Putin takes a Snickers bar and bites into it, experiencing the mood-altering effects.]

Putin: (calmly) Dmitry, let's reconsider this course of action. There must be a way to resolve our differences without violence.

Prigozhin: (pausing, still agitated) But our vision for the country is different!

Lukashenko: (offering the Snickers bar) Have a Snickers, Dmitry. You're not yourself when you're hungry.

[Prigozhin hesitantly takes a bite of the Snickers, and as the delicious taste satisfies his hunger, his demeanor begins to change.]

Prigozhin: (munching) This is unexpectedly satisfying.

[As Prigozhin's agitation subsides, he starts to rethink his plans.]

Prigozhin: (thoughtfully) Maybe there's another way. Perhaps we can find a compromise that benefits our country and maintains stability.

Putin: (nodding) That's the spirit, Dmitry. Let's work together to find a peaceful resolution that upholds our shared goals.

[The tension in the room eases as the three leaders engage in a constructive dialogue, their focus shifting towards finding a mutually beneficial solution.]

Voiceover: (energetically) Snickers: Uniting even the most unlikely allies. When hunger strikes, make peace with Snickers!

[The scene fades out, leaving viewers with a powerful message of resolving conflicts through dialogue and finding common ground.]

If a regular Russian person didn't know about Wagner and Prigozhin now they do, because people were fleeing, roads blocked, events cancelled, the front has moved significantly due to the chaos and Wagner forces missing. Wagner stopped some 200km from Moscow, having shot down helicopters sent to stop their advancement, and basically said ""boo, we got you"". Putin looks weak, Kreml looks weak, Lukashenko gets to play saviour and Prigozhin seems to hold all the cards. 


I think this would be a smarter way to pave way for an actual coup than getting to Moscow and starting bloodshed. Especially if Wagner and Lukashenko baked it together.

The first group consists of moderate Chechnyans and non-Chechnyan minorities. The second group consists of nationalist Chechnyans and extremist muslims.

The first group is supported by Russia. They are given *de facto* independence and Russian funds, and in return they are expected to keep the second group in check.

Sometimes the first group fails to keep the second group in check. Then that group will start bombing Russians or declaring independence, and daddy Russia gets angry; they replace leadership of the first group; and kill a lot of innocents in the progress.

The last time (but certainly not the first time!) that happened was the second Chechnyan War. Since then, Kadyrov (and his dad before him) have been the leader of the first group, and they have done their job well.

So no, Kadyrov would not be more sympathetic to Wagner. It's *his enemies* that they need to worry about - the second group of Chechnyans that they try to keep down.

In 2015 he was appointed to be Shoigu's Deputy. The article seems to imply that he continues to hold that job, even while being the Governor of Tula Oblast.

So Shoigu is being replaced by his Deputy. That's an easy, obvious choice. I wonder if he'll be any different from Shoigu.

> Aleksey Gennadyevich Dyumin (Russian: Алексей Геннадьевич Дюмин; born 28 August 1972) is a Russian politician serving as Governor of Tula Oblast since 2016. Previously, he served as the chief security guard and assistant of Russian president Vladimir Putin before being promoted to lead the Russian military's Special Operations Forces, where he oversaw the annexation of Crimea in 2014. The following year, he became Deputy Minister of Defense.  He holds the rank of lieutenant general and was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. 

> **Career**

> In 1995, he served in the Russian Federal Security Service, followed by the Federal Protective Service. In 2007, Dyumin became head of security of Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov.

> In 2012, Dyumin became the deputy head of the Presidential Security Service.

> In 2014 Dyumin became the deputy chief of the GRU, Russian special operations forces, which has played a key role in the Russian annexation of Crimea. According to the newspaper ""Kommersant"", Dyumin orchestrated the evacuation of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych on February 23, 2014. Dyumin personally declined to comment on it and called all speculation as ""myths"".

Apparently you can be a governor and a Defense Minister's Deputy at the same time.

I do think that anything that leaves Putin in power in the long term must be unacceptable to Prigozhin - he knows Putin will kill him after this mutiny - so I just can't figure out where he thinks he's going to go from here except out of a window.",False,1687630477.0,t3_14hxs7o,t1_jpdhqlv,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

9100883983d41c341a0474f693093818,14hxs7o,jpdlao7,"Putin is not going to bomb his own city, the capital city.

I don't think there's any way Putin is going to let him have more control over the army or resources now, not after what he's done. Putin would always be worrying about another betrayal from him, and a greater one, and it would be giving Prigozhin more leverage, and make him look stronger and Putin weaker.

I think Prigozhin has enough troops to take Moscow. These are battle-hardened veterans skilled in urban warfare, and probably most of the best troops from Moscow are already fighting in Ukraine, so Moscow wouldn't be able to put up much resistance, and there would be confusion since Wagner are Russian and were just fighting with them. Wagner would be effective in taking control of the city, and because they are Russians themselves, they might be able to take much of the city quickly through deliberate public messaging, talks, threats and assassinations. By manipulating people and the public ""We're all on the same side, we want better support in Ukraine/We want regime change, for the good of all Russians""

If Prigozhin has accepted whatever concessions have been offered, i think it's a great miscalculation. Putin branded him a traitor and what he did as treason, and there's been scuffles between Wagner and Russian forces (equipment has been blown up, and probably lives lost). Putin looks weak offering these concessions, even moreso if he goes through with them. If Prigozhin accepts genuine concessions, he'll also look weak for not getting the aim he's stated (Getting Shoigu and going to Moscow). He also said the war in Ukraine is a meat-grinder. He knows they are losing and having heavy casualties, so he'd be forced back into that.

Prigozhin may be a dead man walking. Putin may covertly put out the word of taking out Prigozhin because of what he's done here, or Putin may just outright get him, these concessions being a bluff to stall time while his main army goes to steamroll him.

Or Putin gives him genuine concessions and tries to assassinate him later. Or at least has a military or intelligence force nearby to keep an eye on Wagner from now on. But doing all that, starting with giving genuine concessions, like you said, makes Putin look weak, especially after going on tv and branding them traitors and treasonous actions. That may have been a miscalculation by Putin, reacting too fast and too much, but it may have also prompted Prigozhin to cower down.

Putin reacted very quickly, to an admittedly very quick march, and something was pointed out that stuck in my mind, that Putin was always deliberate in his messaging and propaganda, but here he was caught on the back foot, and that unexpectedness caused him to react in this way.

If Prigozhin is now not taking Moscow and just stalling around a supposed agreement, then the main Russian army can more quickly surround him, especially if he's not taking Moscow, though he may retreat to one of the other cities he took like Rostov. But does it still keep him in a strong position? I don't think Putin will allow him to have that much control for long.

It'll be interesting to see what happens going forward. If Putin gives him genuine concessions and everything mostly goes back to how it was before, then Putin will look weaker and possibly Prigozhin, but less so. If Prigozhin gains some concessions he may seem to be in a better position, but you can't do something like this and get away with it.",1687632217.0,1687631596.0,t3_14hxs7o,t1_jpdhqlv,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Copy/paste from a comment I made earlier:

Russia was about to dissolve Wagner and roll it into the general Russian military in a week's time. I suspect this was 95% about stopping that from happening, and I bet that was part of the concession. Prigozhin made a demonstration proving that the Wagnerites are more loyal to him than the state (and some Russian military, too, if reports of divisions of the military deserting to join Wagner are true). And, of course, Prigozhin also gets his wish to see Shoigu removed, who he's been complaining about forever.

Even without a coup/battle taking place, this is a massive shift in the balance of power in Russia and a huge blow to the perceived strength of the Putin administration and its control over the military. Wagner, a private military contractor, marched to the gates basically unopposed and got what they wanted, uncontested, and are now far more instrumental in directly controlling policy.

I would have liked to see Wagner and the Russian military tear each other apart as much as anyone, but anyone who is dismissing this as a disappointing nothingburger couldn't be further from the truth. **The Russian government just capitulated to a small convoy in less than a day.** Wagner allegedly took no losses while downing 7 Russian aircraft (apparently all Russia could muster to throw at them).

Your last statement is probably true, though. Putin can't give in to a powerful domestic opponent without disempowering him - this is basic Machiavelli 101. He should make sure Prigo goes, somehow.

Trouble is, he might be harder to get at than some dissident journalist or oligarch in Moscow or St Petersburg, since he's sitting in the middle of his own private army that's (usually) parked near the front lines of an ongoing conventional war. Arresting him or discrediting him doesn't seem like it would be an option, disbanding the army legally was already tried, and caused this mess in the first place, and getting at an army leader in the middle of a conventional warzone looks like a riskier-than-average job for the usual FSB hitman.

As a species, when threatened, we are no better than a five year old with crumbs on their face lying that they didn’t eat the last cookie.  When cornered, we lie.

As a result, over time, the more fear, the more lies.  Fascism is so insidious as an ideology because it recognises this — when operating in an environment of fear, there is no need for truth, only strength.  

The result over time seems entirely surreal, but is predictably replicable every since time: 

Everything is Made Up.

Previously, Wagner claimed Russia struck their camps with missiles. This was ""the final straw"" per Wagner and prompted Prigozhin (Wagner's boss) to order his troops Cross the Don (pun intended) and occupy Rostov-on-Don and then drive north towards Moscow.

The mutiny is nominally over Wagner's independence and probably over Russian MoD control, but Prigozhin has accused the Russian MoD of not being aggressive enough regarding mobilization, supplies to Wagner, the state of the war in general. There's a lot of political infighting, with few confirmations but some corroborative observations.

The missile strike is not confirmed. Occupying Rostov is confirmed; Wagner was geolocated at Rostov Military HQ.

Prigozhin's totally delusional if he thinks Putin can afford to let him live very long. Maybe a year or so if he's very useful, but he's dead for sure. Once Putin decides it's time the FSB will get him anywhere he goes.

Meanwhile, Shoigu and Gerasimov control hundreds of thousands of troops, plus tanks, planes, ... and they're supposed to just lie down and die because of some deal? 

Really? If they're not already in custody then they would be committing suicide to let a deal happen.  (And they must have known they were in danger for quite some time now, so ... how would they be dumb enough to be in custody?)

None of it makes any sense. MoD leadership is dead sooner rather than later if Prigozhin takes over MoD ... why would they let that happen? Prigozhin is (eventually) dead if Putin stays in power. Why would he let that happen? 

None of them can trust any of the others. They all have resources the others don't, resources which mean someone will die. Prigozhin's big chance of not dying was the run succeeding. If he agreed to any deal he's dead. Why would Putin let someone make him look weak and live? Prigozhin's only card in the poker game was time.",False,1687631615.0,t3_14hxs7o,t1_jpdh10l,,2,1,0,1,0,0,

He went through the Russian heartland as a hot knife in the butter in a way who would have made Napoleon envious (not because Prigo is a master strategist, but probably because the corruption, the oppression and the disrepair in to which Russian armed forces clearly find themselves -and this stunt has proven it to the whole freaking world- made it possible.) 

He had very probably at least some support from the regular military, as evidence of battalions surrendering to Wagner or even joining them was mounting and resistance to Wagner's advance was close to inexistent.

Given he painted a target on himself by taking this very action in the first place and the fact that the Russian State truly looked powerless in this ordeal, I really think he's retiring troops from Moscow because he's now holding the whole of Russia hostage.

He established himself as a power the Russian State has to negotiate with. Which means the Russian State has basically lost sovereignity on its own territory.

What will be stopping him tomorrow from doing another stunt like this? Putin? And what army? (Literally, at this point.) They bent to him, and are now hostages of Prigozhin demands. The guy may have been a thug of the Russian mafia years ago, but he's not stupid.

I could see the argument being that he ACTUALLY did approve of that message, but the reason I find that doubtful is in large part due to how quick you were to call it a layer of deniability. If it was unapproved messaging by some Wagner intern (lol), then Prigozhin coopted the sentiment the moment he didn't categorically disavow it. Because it LOOKS like an attempt to provide a layer of deniability. And that's the only thing that would matter to a dictator like Putin, particularly after so long in power and the stakes being so high. 

Also remember that Putin's number one fear is ending up like Gaddafi. This isn't over, at least two of Putin, Shoigu,  and Prigozhin don't end the week alive and free at the same time. 

If Putin sides with Prigozhin against Shoigu, there's significant chance of another mad dash to Moscow not only by elements in the MoD loyal to Shoigu, but also his own PMC. Putin also would still need to eliminate Prigozhin, either by assassination or imprisonment or it's inevitable that Prigozhin will continue to slowly seep power away.

“Bahkmut has been a disaster for Ukraine”- Yes Ukraine took heavy losses but they exhausted Russian combat power and inflicted a minimum of triple the losses they suffered onto Russian forces.

Okay if this actually ends in a negotiation then that leads some credence to this conspiracy theory I posted last night from Ukraine War Video Report:

The theory was that this was all a false-flag designed to give Putin cover so that he could end the war in Ukraine, and bring the troops home without looking like a massive loser and having the populace (which support the war) rebel against him. So, Wagner declares the war was started under false pretenses, Prigozhin blames the MoD and other leaders for duping Putin into battle, and then Putin can bring all the troops home to defend from Wagner. Then there's a quick negotiation, and Putin can say he ended the war in Ukraine as part of the negotiated peace with Wagner. Then it looks like Wagner forced him to do it, and he managed to hold Russia together from another revolution.

If this whole thing ends with a negotiation, with only a few casualties and helicopters destroyed, with Putin in power and Prigozhin not dead.... I'm not one for conspiracy theories but... this is the sort of shit Putin pulled to take power in the first place. Is it really that far-fetched?

Russia is at war with Ukraine in a stalemate, and Wagner is a meaningful part of their forces.

Wagner said they were hit by missiles, Prigozhin dislike the MoD.

Prigozhin said this wasn't a coup, but that they would march on Moscow if MoD wasn't removed.

Wagner did no harm to ground troops, but shoot down any air vehicle that approached.

The Russian army didn't try to stop Wagner on the ground but russian soldiers were digging trenches and demolishing roads and posting in Moscow, meaning the intention was there but not the resources.
