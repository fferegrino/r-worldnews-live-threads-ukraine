Ukraine's President Zelensky has also warned that Russian forces are preparing to bombard the southern city of Odesa.

There are reports of multiple military checkpoints in the city, but the streets remain calm and largely empty.

Almost one million people live in the historic port city on the Black Sea coast. Odesa is close to the Moldovan border and the Russia-backed breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria.

Russian forces have made progress in southern Ukraine since their invasion.

Mykhailo Shmushkovich, the city official in charge of European solidarity, said more than 100,000 people had already fled Odesa.

But he said the city was ""ready to fight"".

""It could happen any moment. You can't ever be ready for that,"" he added.

*Instilling puppet regimes in at least 2 confirmed countries recently.

**Fact**: Such an agreement was never made. NATO’s door has been open to new members since it was founded in 1949 – and that has never changed. This “Open Door Policy” is enshrined in Article 10 of NATO’s founding treaty, which says “any other European State in a position to further the principles of this Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic” can apply for membership. Decisions on membership are taken by consensus among all Allies. No treaty signed by the United States, Europe and Russia included provisions on NATO membership.  
  
The idea of NATO expansion beyond a united Germany was not on the agenda in 1989, particularly as the Warsaw Pact still existed. This was confirmed by Mikhail Gorbachev in an interview in 2014: ""The topic of 'NATO expansion' was not discussed at all, and it wasn't brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn't bring it up, either.""  
  
Declassified White House transcripts also reveal that, in 1997, Bill Clinton consistently refused Boris Yeltsin's offer of a 'gentlemen's agreement' that no former Soviet Republics would enter NATO: ""I can't make commitments on behalf of NATO, and I'm not going to be in the position myself of vetoing NATO expansion with respect to any country, much less letting you or anyone else do so…NATO operates by consensus.""

my family, in particular my mom, is pretty heartbroken by this whole thing.  she's a retired nurse for a children's hospital and watching mothers and kids flee is not easy (she also had trouble watching her former colleagues being overwhelmed by covid).  we've donated money, are looking to send clothes, but she wants to do more.  in particular, we have some extra space, and my mom would be very willing to host a Ukrainian family. 

Granted, we're pretty far from europe (california), and my guess is that Ukrainians who do end up here would probably find places with the greater Ukrainian diaspora.  But she would like to put the option out there.  

Is there such a thing?   We would call a local consulate/embassy, but figure they're going to be completely overwhelmed coordinating refugees, people who want to go the other way to fight for ukraine, etc.  Figure it might also be helpful for others.

Ramzan Kadyrov said that bandera's men and Volodymyr Zelensky's Europe will not save him.

Mr. Kadyrov also said that Mr. Zelensky is not able to solve the problems he faced.

You are experiencing low-quality trolling. The Russian troll farms are on their third string or fourth string, because the good ones are either working the home-front or quit when the checks bounced, so we're getting noobs who don't know how to stir up shit properly. Their typical modus operandi goes like this: today, the Russian government wants to propagate an idea, let's call it ""X"". Then, your trolls go out and discuss X using methods both straight-forward and subtle:

Have you guys heard of ""X""?

""X"" is dumb!

We should support ""X""

Honest question, ""X""?   (This is my personal favorite)

Why not ""X""?

""X"" is for idiots

etc, ad nauseam.

They'll carry on conversations with themselves and each other. They'll argue for X and against X and for neutrality on X, not to actually win any particular argument, but to get past your mental guard and plant the idea. Right now, for whatever reason, the Russians are scared shitless that we'll take away the rest of their garbage airplanes, so ""NFZ is bad"" = X.

Once you see the pattern, you can develop mental rules of thumb to spot the bullshit. In addition, troll posters don't try very hard to hide their origins, since it costs next to nothing to drop a burned username and start again fresh:

1) AdjectiveNounNumber usernames (note: not using Reddit's auto-generation template)

2) Out of date American pop culture references with typos for usernames

3) Repetitively posting about all sides of X

4) Being unnaturally easy to wind up, even for reddit (boss is watching, gotta be seen to be loyal!)

5) Not understanding obvious cultural shibboleths

6) Weird shifts in poster personality in the last couple of months (indicative of ""seasoned"" accounts purchased for nefarious use)

7) Karma whoring, usually on AskReddit or other high-traffic subs (who has sexed the sexiest sex?)

TL:DR: you're not crazy, people are being annoying because they are bad at trolling, which is somehow a job now in places with jerk-ass leadership and no money.

1. Sabotage
2. Pilot mutiny/sickout/refusal
3. They don't have as many as they claim
4. They want an excuse in case they lose
5. They're terrified of anti-aircraft weapons
6. They're scared of someone attacking their flank

Pilots aren't conscripts. They're trained for years and can't be replaced quickly. They are required to know English so they aren't limited by Russian-language propaganda. It is entirely conceivable that they're either refusing to fly or made it so they can't fly.

On the other hand, Russia is the master of faking equipment. During the cold war, they regularly made it seem like they had far more than they actually did.

There is always the option that they aren't bringing out the modern weapons because they want an excuse if they lose. You've already seen them argue that they barely have deployed anyone. If Ukraine wins against old equipment, ""clearly"" it was because Russia wasn't trying.

The one that seems most convincing to me is that they're afraid someone else is going to take advantage of the war and attack their flank. If they believed NATO might stage an invasion of Russia right now (because everyone\* wants Russia), they can't have the only jets capable of taking them on occupied.

The ""win"" by the Russian military invading and initially taking over the main cities seems likely, even with their issues.

But it's also a ""loss"" at this point because they completely showed their ass and it's only going to be more of a slog.  And, they united NATO.  Yet some think that as long as Russia ""wins"", it's an absolute win but that's objectively just not true.  Russia doesn't want a slog.  They'll certainly claim it, others may join them, but it just won't be true.

On the economic front, some are claiming that Russia's economy won't completely collapse, that China and India will help prop them up.  And sure, some of that to a degree is probably true.  But...can you imagine suddenly your country can't deal with basically anyone?  Russia not becoming a Mad Max world isn't a ""win"" - it's going to be devastating.

However some people imply that this situation is almost entirely Putin and a tiny bunch of henchmen, as if the entire population are all innocent victims, kept in the dark, waiting to be liberated and shown some American TV shows, whereupon they'll immediately see how good life could be our way.

How true is this? It seems overly idealistic to me. 
It's important to understand the reality and, like Nazi Germany, I can imagine there might be a large chunk of the Russian population who strongly support everything. What percentage do you think are strongly behind all this and see the west/NATO as an enemy?

Obviously NATO can't get involved first but the idea that Russia would send nukes because NATO gets involved in Ukraine is far-fetched. Putin might be mad enough to want nukes involved but for everyone around him to agree to mutually assured destruction is extreme. Who in their right mind would guarantee nukes being dropped on their own country? Especially when Russia itself isn't even being invaded. 

I'm tired of Putin taking advantage of the West's submissive attitude because of the constant spectre of nukes being used. Putin now thinks everything is an act of war: sending supplies to Ukraine, sanctions, other countries wanting to join NATO. It doesn't end and this doesn't end with Ukraine either. How many times can Putin play the nuke card to get what he wants?

If we want Putin ousted then the best way to do that is to cause conflict in his inner circle. Disagreements over whether to use nukes is the most likely topic that would divide Putin from his group. We know that Putin doesn't care about damage to Russia's economy or about how the Russian people are affected. All he cares about is enriching himself and his friends so that he can maintain his power. 

A situation where Putin demands nukes being used and members of his group disobeying that order is how Putin finally gets removed. The Russian people are either too brainwashed or not strong enough to revolt against him themselves. We can sanction Russia to death and squeeze the Russian people as much as we can but it's so unlikely that they would actually come together to oust Putin.",False,1646596616.0,t3_t83ti0,t3_t83ti0,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

There were plenty of Russian fuckups but they are still a very powerful and destructive force that is currently laying fucking waste to entire major Ukrainian cities.
So fuckoff with this 12 year old level spam of 'russian military is weak' as they rain tens of thousands of artillery shells, rockets, missiles and bombs into these cities. Russian military isn't as pathetic as this trash opinion that's getting annoyingly spammed thinks.      
No, instead Ukraine's defenders are very very impressive in the face of such a powerful and overwhelming force. The mass death and destruction the Russian military is facing in my opinion is far more due to the Ukrainian defenders and their plentiful amount of shoulder fired, heat-seeking anti tank and air missiles than it is Russian logistics or equipment problems (which are big issues but nothing compared to having these missiles creeping around in every alley and ditch and behind every tree and building).

""We have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law,"" the social media company said in a series of Twitter posts. It said in-app messaging would not be affected by the decision.

He has specifically said so. The west should be given a heads up that there is a possibility Putin is going to provoke America and NATO into firing a shot so he is justified taking out the nukes and pointing them. Then he will have those Cold War tensions that he has been talking about. I think the west should be warned and even tell the Russian people that this is where we are heading. Appeal to the humanity of the Russian people. We shouldn’t go 40 years backwards in one week   


Look how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. “I want mutually assured destruction”. It’s the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they’re playing the long game. They figure in the long run it’s worth it. Which I disagree with. But it’s not about Ukraine

For Putin it’s a long game with his people’s livelihood. As it’s always been with communist leaders. 

If you watch from nine minutes on he explains that the only way to address this whole list of grievances he goes over in the first nine minutes is to re-shift the balance of power. And we do that through mutually assured destruction. His concept is that mutually assured destruction  is a balancing vehicle. So it would get Russia back some leverage it last and push America and the waist down.
He is upset that we put our missiles around his border. We claimed they were in the name of the fence. This is why he did the exact same thing and it was his main strategy going into Ukraine. Declaring independent like we did in Kosovo. Moving your forces in the name of peacekeeping. And he was just cheeky about it. The next step is to beat America into a war so he can have this bullshit crazy stand us. And keep his people blind and only sitting on his narrative

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  

Next thing he will do is make more threats and escalate. Do things like look crazy like shoot out a nuclear power plant. Pretend to look crazy and not him self (KGB tactic). And then start to influence the right wing in America wanting to go to war to help. I’m sure whoever has influence has already done this did you notice Trump did a 180 and suddenly called it a holocaust? Then the next day Lindsey Graham said we should shoot Putin. Who gave them those ideas? Who put those in their heads?

We are trying to be manipulated into a war. It’s the only way Putin can do what he said he wanted to do. Without the nukes and somehow in his twisted mind getting back some leverage he thinks he lost




Mark my words the next couple of weeks you’re going to see Putin do anything to try to get the west to get involved. Either through fear or through making it look like a humanitarian crisis, some thing. But he’s going to want to use his Internet trolls to also get the sentiment in America to get them involved.


But that’s what he wants and we can’t do it. And it’s pretty messed up. I even have family there. Either Ukraine is the sacrificial lamb and we show Putin for who he is. Or, we get involved and trigger Cold War tensions and escalations to what we look like World War III. As tough as we are, it’s really hard to do anything when another country has the same nuclear arsenal you have. In fact more. And I don’t know how many new submarines he was bragging about


In 2019 I started to compile links. Not research. But things I was noticing as I watched Russia in the news. Putin had been preparing for a war. This has been long prepared. Don’t be fooled by the crappy tanks and bad maneuvers in Ukraine. It’s all for bait. They want to appear weak so that the west can come in. They want to threaten and make Putin seem crazy. They attack nuclear plants and cars humanitarian crisis. I’ll because Putin wants to be in a world war. Or make it begin the process of wine. Also he can get a new security deal. He said so himself

You will see. He’s going to do things that don’t make sense because his intention is to escalate. He already said it. Give me a deal or war. Today to macron. 

Zelensky should tell the world and call
Him on it

People disclosed the information more, stopped hiding the issues of corruption that they had previously.

1. It's Putin's end game. He has to start his fascist Duginist fantasy now, or he'll run out of (life-)time
2. He needs a casus belli that keeps the rest of the world, especially China, out of his ""Eurasian"" all-out war.
3. A move that would entice NATO to fire the first shot would be perfect for that.
4. Regular troops are held back, possibly close to Baltic states and Scandinavia, along with modern airpower
5. The strange mixture of conscript troops and elite terrorist units (Chechens) used in Ukraine is both used as bait (conscripts) and to spread fear/commit war crimes (terror Units) in order to prompt Western audiences to demand direct intervention while bolstering support at home (""they're slaughtering our boys"" - conscripts)

The solution is very simple. Unlike Afghanistan, where the enemy hid in caves, the USA can pull up the exact location of every Russian tank/launcher/troop carrier currently on the roads, besieging cities and headed to the capital. And like Syria, we use drones, fire missiles from ships, and destroy those targets. We don't even need troops in Ukraine. 

We tell Russia, not only are they breaking international law but also they are targeting and killing civilians. In order to protect the senseless death of 1000s of innocent civilians, any military presence in the Ukraine will be eliminated. Withdraw troops to Russia or else they'll be destroyed. Period. 

If they want to launch a nuke, that's on them. We're already giving guns/ammo/missiles that are being used to kill Russians, part of the reason Russia is having issues is the west is sending Ukraine a shit ton of boom. Whether we fire it or Ukraine fires it, that's not the difference between a nuclear war and not a nuclear war. 

If Hitler had nukes we would have let him run through Europe killing Jews? At some point, you can't let a madman slaughter innocent people when we have to power to stop it. The nuclear option is a deterrent to being invaded. We're not invading Russia, we're stopping them from killing 1,000s of people for no reason at all.

The problem with “USSR victory” is that it swept the Soviet crimes under a carpet - so much so that when Eastern European countries have tried to bring attention to Soviet crimes - deportations in cattle cars for weeks to Siberia and Far East, executions, occupation - we’ve been told that we don’t understand how horrible Holocaust was. We do and shamefully there were people who participated in them here as well, but whilst Germany was made to apologise, repent, and learn from its crimes, Soviet Union/Russia never was and the atrocities they committed are not considered as horrible.

99395ae3b65bbd3f008ad2d49692bb8e,t83ti0,hzlxbog,"There are a few big issues:

1. Pilots - having pilots that can fly the correct mission types is one thing (close support, SEAD, strike, air superiority) but they won't be familiar with the aircraft type. It's a lot of hours for a pilot to retrain in a new aircraft of the same type, and even more if you are training in new roles.

 Something as complex as an F35 would be particularly problematic there given the level of computer input compared to a cold war design, even more so if you're talking F35B with VSTOL capabilities. 

In practice you'd need to have the pilots go to the UK or the USA for 6 months training, which means they aren't flying sorties over Ukraine instead.

2. Logistics - giving the planes is fine, and given the distance you can probably transfer them with an ordinance load, but beyond that where is the ordinance coming from. The avionics/targeting packages and hardpoint won't be set up for eastern block ordinance, so you'll have to truck it in from Poland/Germany having airlifted the stuff there in the first place. Combined payload of an F35 is up to 18,000lb which means around 2 trucks worth of munitions per mission per plane. 10 planes is a 20 truck convoy of ordinance per day assuming 100% sortie rate, traveling hundreds or more miles there and back.

Thats just munitions. Then you need spare parts, and this is the really difficult bit, as lots of these will be large, delicate and tough to transport. Without them the aircraft will quickly become useless.

3. Maintenance staff - you need a lot more engineers than pilots, and they take longer to train. Each part of the aircraft has a standard procedure for maintenance, overhaul and replacement. Cutting edge western aircraft are particularly maintenance intensive and will have technology, particularly avionics, that isn't easy to just read up a manual on.

4. Technology sensitivity - The US and China just had a race to recover a downed F35 (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/f35-crash-china-stealth-recovery-b2000753.html). Either Russia or China would love to capture or shoot down an F35 and recover it for study. Basing them in a fluid warzone where you can't protect them, giving them to inexperienced pilots in an environment with extensive missile cover and low level AA is asking for some to be lost.

5. Impact - given the aerial environment where Russia has superiority (if not supremacy), there is no guarantee that they will do much good. In practical terms of you want to sustain constant sortie rates you need 2-3x the aircraft you want ""up"" at any one time in order to allow for maintenance and repair. Even with that, a full package needs recon support, AWACS cover, jamming and SEAD, refueling support etc and then multiple squadrons to actually own the skies.

All in all, it's far more cost effective to give easily used, compact weapons that have high value added. Javelin/NLAW and Stinger are superbly capable weapon systems. And those trucks needed just for the ordinance for 10 F35s for a single day would carry *thousands* of those, and can do it tomorrow, not in 6 months time when the pilots are trained up.",False,1646593587.0,t3_t83ti0,t1_hzlnph2,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Let's build good roads, quality health care and education, and eventually come up with the kind of technology that would allow us to be the first to colonize Mars. That would be quite empire-like,""

Amazing how few autocrats do this calculation.  The Russian invasion has probably cost them billions of dollars in direct spending (food, fuel, ammo, contracting, etc), and obviously the sanctions will cost 10s of billions.

with that money they could have set up hundreds of joint ventures in ukraine, made both countries richer, and... guess what... had a lot more influence over ukraine.  This went out the window in 2014, and to be effective would have needed happen even earlier.  but realistically, thats the kind of stuff you should be doing to maintain your ""sphere of influence"" in the modern world. 

(goes off on tangent)  It is broadly similar to one of my critiques of the joint strike fighter's price tag. if you had told lockheed that instead of a stealth fighter, we want to go to Mars...  we'd have been there 10 years ago.  And we'd have done it with mostly those same engineers, technicians, and factories (e.g., the ""jobs"" counterargument doesn't work).  at this point i'm sure the JSF will be a fine plane for decades (and at this very second I'm sure the US military is glad we have them), but still.

hell, it could have been another opportunity to involve Russia, back in the day.  ""Instead of building a mass produced stealth fighter for every western country, we'll include you in our Mars mission, including cosmonaut boots on the planet, if you formally play nice around the world""

I feel like I constantly have to explain this...

Russia is not omnipotent and neither is the US. In the event of a war between these two powers both sides are operating under the assumption that a nuclear launch could happen at any moment. As such the pin is already going to be pulled, if you get me. They're just holding onto the grenade wondering when they should finally throw it. 

The most likely way a nuclear war would start is by accident. Not only that, in the event of nuclear conflict the only slim chance you have of ""winning"" comes from bombing the shit out of your opponent before they can launch all their missiles. So if you get any information (by its nature incomplete) that the other side is planning, or even *considering* a nuclear launch, you have about 30 minutes to decide whether to launch or not. 

It isn't about ""wanting"" nuclear war, it's feeling you have no choice. 

Also people aren't rational. Any system built on human reason is inherently going to fail. People are idiot monkeys. I say this because you people really, really, do not grasp this and what it means.",False,1646597667.0,t3_t83ti0,t1_hzm4lnl,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

Frankly, and intervention solves two problems in one go.

Compare to a situation like now, where even if Russia loses in their invasion of Ukraine, they will not (realistically should not anyway) feel as though Russia itself is facing an existential threat. If the US as a whole had planes circling Moscow or boots on the ground in Rostov, though, that’s a different story.

If he wanted Russia to become a superpower again he would need to stop looting it from inside. All he cares about is himself and his inner circle. He wants to keep Russia isolated and without western influence so he and his friends can continue looting and abusing ordinary Russians for their gain. 

On that note though, I do agree that he does want to provoke a war with the west, that will help those goals and further his ability to keep a stronghold on Russia. They've already started wars twice in the recent decades to have an excuse to postpone elections and change the constitution to enable him to stay in power. Recent laws and blocking western media/internet is exactly what he needs to further cement his stranglehold.

This is a sharp contrast to Hitler for example, that actually did in his sick twisted mind have huge ambitions for Germany to become a superpower. In my opinion Putin doesn't give a shit, he's just in it for personal gain. China on the other hand, goes both ways. They legitimately want to become the next de facto superpower, usurping the US (not necessarily through conflict however). Their leaders are also looting the country for personal gain, but they are not allowed to do it on nearly the scale that Russia does. China will not allow corruption to get so bad that their military will become ineffective. It was getting close to that point but they have actually been cracking down on corruption in recent years because they know that it will weaken them and threaten their eventual goal as a nation. Russia has no goal as a nation other than to provide as much money for Putin's inner circle as possible, and to keep him in power. They have _no idea_ what to do when Putin eventually does. China will be able to eventually replace Xi without missing a step however.

Edit: Can you imagine Putin trying to crack down on corruption like Xi has done? The idea alone is laugable. He is the most corrupt person alive in this world today. By some estimates he's also quite likely the richest person in the world.",1646602994.0,1646602568.0,t3_t83ti0,t1_hzmf9f5,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

Everything else is somewhere in the middle, jets specifically are closer to the carrier than a rifle in terms of prior requirements - you need spare parts, training, integration with your existing comms, radar, and IFF systems, and much more.

He also doesn't seem to have expected economic sanctions so brutal that they have effectively cut Russia out of the Western economy.

Clearly things aren't going to plan. Poor military leadership, a failure to establish air superiority,  and an unexpectedly stern Ukrainian resistance all mean Putin is having a much more difficult time sweeping through Ukraine than he expected, and the economic sanctions are crippling the Russian economy in a way that is impossible for Putin or the average Russian citizen to ignore. 

However, Putin really doesn't have an off-ramp here. Short of overthrowing the Ukrainian government and then gaslighting the hell out of the people of Russia to convince them that the invasion was a necessary evil, there's not really any way for Putin to end this conflict that looks good for him at home, and to some degree at least he needs to appear strong to Russians to hold on to power (and, probably, ultimately save his own life). That means he's probably going to put the whole might of the Russian military behind this war if need be. Even nukes probably aren't off the table, although that would be a real hail mary that would lead to a whole host of new problems, and Putin probably understands that. 

Ultimately the most likely outcome seems to be a pyrric victory for Putin. I expect that Kiev will fall, and that Zelenskyy will either be killed, imprisoned, or escape Kiev and set up a government in exile. Russia will have faced extremely heavy losses and will not have the resources to quell an insurgency with the brutailty necessary to truly crush it, especially since that insurgency will be receiving back-door funding from basically every intelligence agency in Europe and North America. I expect Ukraine to become what Germany was during the Cold War: the tension point between East and West that neither side can take full control of without seriously risking WWIII. This is almost definitely not the outcome Putin wants, but at this point it's hard to see any realistic outcome that is better for him.",False,1646600375.0,t3_t83ti0,t1_hzmap0u,,1,5,0,5,0,0,

If you forget literally everything we know about Russia and Ukraine, erase all the short-term context and long-term considerations, the invasion is going OK for Russia, for now. It's not like Ukraine is getting ready for a counter-offensive to Moscow. Russia is still taking ground and unless that stops, they will eventually force the whole country.

But if you consider everything surrounding the conflict, especially including Russia's initial planning and their long-term political goals, they've already lost even if they do win a tactical victory through great cost.

He's going to incite and exacerbate ethnic tensions in the Baltics, then use it as a pretext for grey-area operations like cyber attacks.  NATO won't do anything.

Then, at some point (probably once there's a new administration in the US), he'll send troops into a NATO member and the alliance will be so scared of nukes (he already used one!) and so torn over what to do that there's only a weak disunited response.

They're losing so much equipment, like tanks, jets, helicopters, trucks, artillery and fuel supplies, and so much manpower, that they're having to ship more troops and equipment over, some from as far away as Vladivostok! The initial staging equipment and troop count was not enough. Their supply lines were poorly planned, and are getting hit with precision, so their advances are frequently stalled.

But Russia is a nation of millions of people and can easily raise 1 million troops if need be. They surely have more equipment in reserve, but the quality of the equipment already deployed is sowing doubt about what they might have in reserve. For some reason it looks like they're shipping regular vehicles to the front in lieu of military equipment, but it's possible that they never actually enter Ukraine. It's a weird transport of equipment if they don't, though.

Troop morale is low. People are cutting their own fuel lines and surrendering to avoid combat.

Westerners can put much more into a war of attrition/pissing contest than the Russians, their best strategy would have been to use top troops to capture Zelensky and key government institutions during the chaos of the first couple of days. Once defenders get entrenched its a lot harder to break them. We saw this with the sending in of the Kadyrovites, the Wagner group, and other elite forces to try to assassinate or capture Zelensky, all of which were destroyed because the Ukrainians knew where they were coming.

He *has to* hold back his more advanced weaponry because otherwise he is left exposed to larger regional wars that may break out/won't be able to project power meaningfully.

It's far from over, but what you're going to see is the slow leveling of Ukrainian cities with conventional 'dumb' weapons. They know the Ukrainians can't push them out, and they will just sit in their positions and destroy cities that could threaten their supply lines once they move past them. They can't use armour/air force to move quickly because of all the western anti air and anti armour supplied to Ukraine.

Ukraine's hope is that they can slow them down enough and inflict enough damage that eventually the Russians back down due to the combination of losses and economic sanctions. They know they will continue to receive weapons and aid from the West as long as necessary, and as I said, the West can spend for a lot longer, especially with the sanctions.

Long story short, there was this conspiracy theory pushed in right wing media that Joe Biden had used his position as vice president to pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor that was investigating corruption at a gas company his son Hunter was employed at. Trump was president at the time and withheld military aid to Ukraine that had been authorised by congress unless they announced an investigation into Hunter Biden. Note that they didn't have to actually investigate - just \*announce\* an investigation - it was purely a stunt to try and undermine Joe Biden's presidential campaign before it got off the ground.

This is what Trump's first impeachment was over - the military aid had been signed off by congress and he did not have the authority to withhold it.

It's an interesting conspiracy theory because they took a real event and reversed parts of the story. The prosecutor was actually known to be corrupt and wasn't investigating corruption in Ukraine (including at the gas company involved), and was believed to be in the pocket of Russian oligarchs. The pressure was put on Ukraine by the EU, America, the world bank and the IMF. It had bipartisan support in America and was the official position of the federal government at the time, which means it wasn't up to VP Biden's office in the first place.

Which means that if anything, getting that prosecutor sacked was actually putting Hunter's company in the firing line, not protecting it.

Ultimately the Germans were held responsible therefore for igniting a possible regional conflict into a full blown European war.

Between 1965 and 1968, the treaty was negotiated by the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament, a United Nations-sponsored organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. Opened for signature in 1968, the treaty entered into force in 1970.

I do know that Ukraine moved a bunch of inoperable aircraft into their military airbases just prior to the war while moving their actual flight-worthy aircraft out, to give the appearance on satellite imagery that those bases were still active.   The first round of cruise missiles thus just hit a bunch of already useless scrap.   It's the same strategy that kept many of their SAMs in play.

Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics.

Dear Viktor Gennadievich!

pursuant to your order regarding the formation of shock battalion groups, I have to report the following: due to the massive refusal to take part in the hostilities of the personnel of the military units that were supposed to be involved in staffing the above battalion groups, the Armed Forces of Belarus have no opportunity to equip any battalion group .

Conducting explanatory work with the commanders of military units did not produce results. I have the courage to assume that the replacement of the commanders of these military units, who were unable to organize the formation of groups on the ground, will not give us the result we need.

In view of the above, I ask for your decision regarding the acceptance of my resignation.

Big enough that you're not moving it without getting noticed.  Put it this way; a [Czech hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_hedgehog) or [dragon's teeth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon%27s_teeth_(fortification%29) are likely not enough. They can stop tanks, but tanks don't have anywhere near the same momentum a train does. They're also easy to remove with heavy machinery in territory that you control.

Even if you did a even -spread between three branches (there's like 6 different branches for the Russians), that means 300k soldiers at best. *Half of which - are conscripts for their 1 year of service.*

And because of the special economic operations we put on them - They have to keep some in the country in case their prevention plans go sideways and country wide riots happen. Someone has to maintain all those bases, and Russia has a wide amount of territory they need to maintain control over. And that takes troops being present to do so.

They are not going to commit 100% of their attacking force to taking Ukraine. They have committed 111 out of the 117 staged combat BTG's to the invasion of Ukraine. The 6 combat BTG's are mostly guarding the command HQ's for each front (North, East, South). The 70k support staff of that 100k men or so are shuffling supplies to them. Sure, they can draw up more conscripts - but at this point - Ukraine has shown they are simply target practice and waste of resources/equipment. They aren't even *good* for holding towns/cities that they have already taken. 

Their Air force can no longer fix the planes they have, they can no longer get the components to even make the spare parts they need, we don't know how many are actually operational and they lack guided munitions which means they have to fly low. Which means even if the Ukraine's only have stinger missiles - so long as we continue to flood the country with them - the Russians are losing aircraft that they *cannot* replace. As in, it takes years for them to build new migs. And they are losing a few every single day. 

They have no tactical comms, no NVG, they aren't in good communication or coordinating with other units. They don't even have enough trucks to resupply the BTG's that they have committed. And most of all - their troops did not know they were going into a war - and thus were not prepared at all for this at any level. They thought the training exercises were a joke/bullshit and selling fuel/supplies for Alcohol etc. 

At a certain point, it's gonna be better for Russia to pull out and go invade Georgia or Moldova or some other non-NATO country that is smaller and get a quick PR victory - then it is to stay in Ukraine.

If Ukraine knock out 30-50k of their combat troops (killed/wounded/deserted/etc.) - it's over. They cannot hold the land they have grabbed. Shock and Awe tactics aren't going to work like shelling a city to dust. And they aren't going to reform BTG's with even lower morale and send them back in till they have nothing left.",1646594000.0,1646592561.0,t3_t83ti0,t1_hzlsxz8,,5,1,0,1,0,0,

 >A no-fly zone, also known as a no-flight zone (NFZ), or air exclusion zone (AEZ), is a territory or area established by a military power over which certain aircraft are not permitted to fly. Such zones are usually set up in an enemy power's territory during a conflict, similar in concept to an aerial demilitarized zone, and usually intend to prohibit the country's military aircraft from operating in the region. Military action is employed by the enforcing state and, depending on the terms of the NFZ, may include preemptive attacks to prevent potential violations, reactive force targeted at violating aircraft, or surveillance with no use of force.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

You can track the scientist assigned to MDEP by going through the publication list and the faculty lists. You can track their wealth from that and from after the project. We know who was paid what, they told us. There are interviews with these people.
