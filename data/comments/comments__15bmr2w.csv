fa14bfdfacd37e1aeebd082d99811b0a,15bmr2w,jtv145w,"Day 515-520 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last few days continued to be pretty quiet for us here, there were no missile strikes aimed directly at Kharkiv, but I’m pretty sure there were some that were aiming at towns in Kharkiv oblast. Some Shaheds were also spotted in our region at least once since my last post, but all of them were intercepted. They never send many of them at any target in our region, so they don’t pose much of a threat if they are not followed by a missile strike right after. 

In the last few months missile strikes almost completely stopped here, but instead Russians started using guided bombs pretty frequently, though since their range is pretty small, they are never used against our city. Apparently now Russians think that trying to destroy food is the best use of their missiles, so they are almost never used against military targets. I’ll never understand why they think that attacking civilian targets is going to help them win the war, but it’s honestly better for us that way, they are just wasting their ammo.

Today they tried to target civilians in Dnipro with missiles, but they were mostly unsuccessful this time. They hit an abandoned building of the SBU and a high-rise apartment building. Thankfully that apartment building wasn’t currently in use as it was just recently built, so civilian casualties ended up being pretty minimal, and there were no deaths reported. They even used their Iskander missiles in this strike, which are pretty accurate, so you can’t say that an apartment building being hit was an accident. We were lucky that they chose 2 empty buildings as targets this time, otherwise there could have been much more casualties.",False,1690580561.0,t3_15bmr2w,t3_15bmr2w,,0,234,0,234,1,1,{'gid_2': 1}

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-28-23/index.html

""Ukrainian forces have consolidated gains along the southern front after successfully capturing the village of Staromaiorske in Donetsk region and repelled Russian attacks in the east, officials have said.

“[On Thursday] under heavy fire from enemy aircraft and artillery, Ukrainian soldiers liberated the settlement of Staromaiorske in Donetsk region and are consolidating the achieved lines,” the spokesman for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Andrii Kovalov, said during a briefing on Friday. 

“At the same time, the enemy made unsuccessful attempts to regain the lost ground in the areas of Rivnopil and Makarivka in Donetsk region,"" he said, but added that ""the Russian occupiers continue to put up strong resistance.""

Ukrainian forces are now expected to turn their attention to the neighboring village of Urozhaine, just across the Mokri Yaly river, to the east. Russian officials and well-connected pro-Moscow military bloggers fear their positions in the village will now be very difficult to maintain.

The reports of Ukraine consolidating its gains come the day after two US officials told CNN that Ukraine has committed more forces to the south east of the country -- in a sign that Kyiv has identified potential weaknesses in Russian defensive lines and is ramping up its counteroffensive.

Gains in the east: “Ukraine methodically rolled up Staromaiorske for several days, knocking personnel out of their shelters and turning those shelters into piles of broken bricks… Losing a populated area after a stubborn and no doubt heroic defense was a blow to our military ego,” the commander of the “Vostok” battalion which is operating in the area, Alexander Khodakovsky, said on Telegram.

“[Ukraine] went on the offensive, clinging to the outskirts [of Staromaiorske] and gradually pressing us back, at the same time creating a flank threat to the positions on Urozhaynoye (Russian for Urozhaine).”

“The capture of [Staromaiorske] gives access to Urozhaynoye (Russian for Urozhaine) from the west and north,” added a pro-Russian blogger, Semyon Pegov. “The enemy's plan in this case is obvious: the Armed Forces of Ukraine intend to pincer the [Russian Federation] Armed Forces,” another pro-Moscow journalist, Rybar, wrote.

""Dragon teeth"" defenses: A few miles to the west, also along the southern frontline, Ukrainian forces for the first time reached Russia’s ""dragon teeth"" fortification, part of its main line of defense.

Satellite imagery had previously shown that Russia installed the ""dragon's teeth"" lines -- concrete and rebar pyramids designed to block the advance of armored vehicles -- across the territory they control in Ukraine. CNN has geolocated the video to an area just east of the small villages of Nove and Kharkove, near Robotyno, along the Melitopol axis, in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia oblast. 

Ukraine has not commented on any advances near Robotyno or towards Urozhaine, with the General Staff saying only that “Ukrainian Defense Forces continue to conduct the offensive operation on Melitopol and Berdiansk axes, consolidating their positions.”""",False,1690541084.0,t3_15bmr2w,t3_15bmr2w,,0,50,0,50,0,0,

>
>*The Yale professor on why the west got Putin wrong — and what the past tells us about the war in Ukraine*
>
>February 2022 was a second “1938 moment”, Snyder suggests, referring to the Munich conference of that year, when Britain and France fatally caved in to Hitler’s threats over Czechoslovakia. 
>
>“For me, the reference to 1938 is actually really important because that was a terrible mistake. Had Britain and France stood behind Prague, they would have made the second world war impossible — or at least in the form that it took,” Snyder says. “The war in Ukraine is horrible, but the fact that Russia wasn’t appeased is a sign that I’d like to think we have learnt something.”
>
>In other ways, however, Snyder laments western policymakers’ long and still tortured reading of Russia — a problem that beset Barack Obama, and still afflicts Germany and France. “Our misreading of Russia is deep. Very deep,” Snyder says.
>
>For Snyder, the west’s lack of historical clarity on Russia has been a deadly mistake, and continues to be at the core of our misreading of Putin. He decries our ongoing focus on “pragmatic” solutions to the conflict, and a conceptualising of Putin as some kind of cynical, but ultimately relatable, power politician in the western mould. 
>
>Putin’s radical ideas have been catastrophically minimised in our analysis, Snyder believes. “Ideas, it turns out, matter. Until far too recently [western] policy discussions about Putin were shaped by our own ideas about technocracy and pragmatism and stability — categories which I think have already worn out their welcome.”
>
>So, I ask, is this Putin’s war, or is this Russia’s war? “This war is being fought by a lot of people who are not called Vladimir Putin,” Snyder says. “The person who pushed the button to fire that missile at Kramatorsk that killed [Ukrainian writer] Victoria [Amelina] and those children . . . the tens of thousands of Russian soldiers fighting and killing in Ukraine now . . . ”
>
>It is a moral as well as an empirical point, he adds. “Putin is going to die, and when he does, does that mean everything else is forgiven? All of the crimes? The deportations, the kidnappings of children, the rapes of women, the castrations of men, the murder of Ukraine’s elite? How can any of that be processed according to the idea that this is his war alone?”
>
>“We drive ourselves round and round in anxious circles about what Russia is thinking about this war, and we’re not letting ourselves realise that the Russians will find ways out for themselves . . . They don’t need for us to have our focus groups and our studies and our exit ramps. Anthropologically speaking, our exit ramps are not applicable to their highways, if you’ll forgive that stupid metaphor?”
>
>He quickly alights on a more elegant turn of phrase: “It’s two different fairy tales, as the Poles say.” 
>
>In Russia, the west seems to forget it is not seeing a mirror nation-state to its own. It is a different paradigm of power altogether, driven by “Weberian notions of charismatic leadership”, says Snyder.
>
>“The thing is, Russia can’t have a domestic policy,” Snyder muses. “The elite have stolen all the money, all the laws are corrupted, and there’s almost no social mobility or possibility of change in most Russians’ lives, so foreign policy has to compensate and provide the raw material — the scenography — for governance.”

""Ukrainian forces are continuing their push around the embattled eastern city of Bakhmut, trying to advance north and south of the city, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Land Forces, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, who described the situation as ""very tense.""

“The enemy is clinging to every centimeter, conducting intense artillery and mortar fire,” Syrskyi explained during a briefing on Friday. “We are gradually advancing and liberating our land.”

Syrskyi went on to say that under such difficult conditions it was important to manage the soldiers at the front carefully and support them with counter-battery fire, in order to protect them from Russia’s intensified artillery.

“To support its troops in the area of Klishchiivka, Kurdiumivka and Andriivka, the enemy has concentrated a significant amount of artillery, the destruction of which is one of the main tasks for our troops,” he explained.

According to the General Staff, Ukrainian forces also repelled a Russian counter-attack in the area. 

“Ukrainian defenders successfully repelled adversary attacks in the areas west and south of Klishchiivka,” it said.

Clashes near Lyman: Ukraine also says they’ve repelled Russian attacks near the Nadiya village, near Lyman, north of Bakhmut.

“Ukrainian troops continue to hold back the Russian offensive in this area,” the spokesman for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Andrii Kovalov said.

According to Syrskyi, Ukrainian troops are holding on but attacks along this line are frequent.

“The enemy is constantly attacking in the Kupyansk and Lyman directions, using its most professional units,” the colonel general said. “Every day we repel numerous assaults in these areas. Not a single position has been lost.”""",False,1690541258.0,t3_15bmr2w,t3_15bmr2w,,0,69,0,69,0,0,

https://www.cnn.com/europe/live-news/russia-ukraine-war-news-07-28-23/index.html

""Moscow reserves the right to take tough measures in response to a missile attack that wounded more than a dozen people in the Russian border region of Rostov on Friday, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.

The official, Maria Zakharova, said the strike on the southwestern Russian city of Taganrog was ""directed against the civilian population and peaceful infrastructure. They obviously had no military meaning.""

Zakharova called on the international community to condemn the attack. ""The Russian side reserves the right to take tough retaliatory measures,"" she said.

What we know about the strike: Earlier on Friday, air defenses shot down a missile over Taganrog. The missile’s remnants fell on the center of the city, leaving 14 people wounded, according to the Russian defense ministry.

The ministry says air defense systems also intercepted a second missile in the Rostov region Friday, but that it ""fell in a deserted area."" Rostov's governor confirmed the second attack.

Friday's strike on Taganrog is believed to be the first time the city – some 40 kilometers (nearly 25 miles) from the border with Ukraine — has been hit since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

What I'm getting at is, when that first line is breached, could it be that the second and third one could collapse rather quick compared to the first one?

The first one is the line of contact, mostly infantry based with no heavy equipment (tanks or anti air for example). Behind this first line is the massive minefield. That's why no heavy equipment is on the first line. The second line is behind the minefield and this is the most fortified line, the one that will be defended the most. Dragon Teeth (or whatever the Russians call dragon teeths), anti tank ditches, maybe barbed wire, concrete based trenches, etc.

Behind the second line is the artillery and AA systems which offers protection for the line of contact, and when it is breached, this equipment should retreat to the third line to provide cover fir the second and fortified line. Behind the second line they are no minefields because the heavy equipment needs clear escape routes.

The third line is a retreat line to prevent a full breakthrough if the second is breached and hold the enemy enough for reserves to counterattack. It's not intended to be so fortified as the second one, but rather delay.

So, to answer your last question, the breakthrough can only happen when they clear the minefields and properly breach the second line.

When you're the ones laying the mines, you know where they are.  And where they aren't.  Related, you can choose to *not* mine certain roads, roads that your artillery has pre-sighted, and just take the roads out, while the opposing forces would get slaughtered when travelling in a narrow, dense single-file over the road by artillery.

They are, along with booby traps, and remote-controlled mines in trenches.

The total number of BARS according to the military commissar of Karelia, Colonel A. Artemyev – up to 100 thousand people. The Southern Military District accounted for 38% of BARS reservists, and this suggested that this district was preparing to attack Ukraine.

>Who and by what decision created a new structure in the Ministry of Defense in Russia was initially unknown. Messages about the recruitment of reservists as part of the BARS-2021 project (Combat Army Reserve of the country) began to appear on the websites of local administrations in Russia. These messages are stylistically and informationally very different from each other. For example, the prefecture of the Northern District of Moscow posted on its website a detailed informational material about ""citizens in the most mobilization-ready state"" (as reservists are called in the prefecture), and in Veliky Novgorod they filmed a short video about young people who came to sign up for the reserve to the military commissar.

>In early August 2021, Konstantin Zapatotsky, head of the organizational and mobilization department of the Southern Military District, said that by September it was planned to create a combat army reserve of 38,000 people in the Southern Military District. Earlier in the Southern Military District, the mobilization manpower reserve was about 400 people.

Translation of the post at 12:49 (40 minutes ago now):

*The Russian president Vlamidir Putin wants to sent free ammunition to African countries to increase security there and also promises to erase 23 billion USD (about 21 billion Euro) in debts. He did this on the second and last day of the Russian-African conference in St Petersburg. On the first day he promised some countries free grain.*

*Putin has stated on the conference to have interest developing a military cooperation with the African continent. He also said he'll 'carefully' study the African proposal for peace in Ukraine. African leaders presented their peace initiative last month to both Putin and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.*  

*Putin, as expected, tries to strengthen the ties with African countries. He did this among other things by urging for Russian grain deliveries, after the Ukrainian grain transports recently were put to a halt due to the expiring of the grain deal. According to Putin, Russia will increase the amount of grain deliveries to Africa and will be a reliable partner.*",False,1690543776.0,t3_15bmr2w,t1_jtsfc2n,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

At the same time it’s not like Ukraine is withholding punches either. Yes they have the nato trained troops that they are just now cycling in now that they want to exploit a breach, but it’s an absolute grind for a reason (namely lack of ammunition and the west sitting on its ass and letting russia set up defenses for six months).

Even accounting for that: Russia looks to be exhausted and in hold on for dear life mode. If the entire russian military needs 6 months and 100k+ casualties just for bakhmut it’s pretty safe to say they can’t sustain real offensive actions on a wide front anymore. Anyone who doesn’t think russia is currently losing despite losing so much ground over the past year and the signs of internal fractures is a nutter. It might be happening slowly but as sanctions start biting harder and harder and these rates of attrition are sustained the state simply can’t compete with the collective west.

I’m not sure Ukraine takes all of that by winter, frankly just one of said locations would be a success.

>MILAN, Italy, July 28, 2023 – The Bureau of the International Fencing Federation (FIE) has decided to permit Ukrainian sabre fencer Olga Kharlan to participate in the forthcoming women’s team sabre team competition at the 2023 Fencing World Championships currently underway in Milan.  
This extraordinary decision came following an incident involving Kharlan, who conceded the penalty against her was correct after refusing to shake hands with an AIN\* opponent. The event occurred at the conclusion of her elimination bout in women’s individual sabre on July 27.  
The FIE stands fully behind the penalty, which, after a thorough review, is in complete accordance and compliance with its official rules and associated penalties.  
“We have discussed this issue and decision thoroughly, and we have met with Ms. Kharlan”, said FIE Interim President Emmanuel Katsiadakis “Furthermore, and after consultation with the International Olympic Committee, we believe this decision is made in keeping with the Olympic Spirit. It also sends a message of sensitivity and understanding to our members and all sports federations, as the world faces tremendous challenges.”  
“I am thankful for this decision of the FIE Bureau”, said Kharlan. “The most important thing for an athlete is to be able to compete, for my family, my team, my country and all the people who support me. During these difficult few days, I appreciate all the support I’ve had from around the world.”

Then, from my experience, everybody started using those specific lines as fact, ignoring any other defensive structures that may or may not have been build since, or simply hadn't been analyzed on satellite.

Which has led us to situations where Ukraine has captured multiple trenches, tree lines, and other defensive structures, only for redditors to claim ""they're still not at the first defensive line!"" as if the red lines on the map are the only defensive structures to exist.

Periods of reform are either cut short or followed by disappointment, with Stalin being an outlier, who forced the country through a massive industrialisation while burning everything to the ground, killing millions, and helping to cause irreparable damage to the USSR in terms of demographics, politics, and sociology.

Going from the Great Purge straight into World War II, wiped the Russian academic class almost off the map, and led to a situation where for one year in particular in the 1920s, almost no males existed with that birth year post-Stalin.

——

Battles raged in southern Ukraine on Thursday, as Kyiv’s stepped-up offensive against the Russian occupation made small gains, according to Russian, Ukrainian and Western analysts and officials, but the scope of the assaults and their toll remained unclear.

A day after U.S. officials said the main thrust of Ukraine’s counteroffensive appeared to have begun, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said, “We confirm that hostilities have intensified and in a significant way.”

But there was minimal, and sometimes contradictory, information about how many troops and armored vehicles Ukraine had committed so far to its attempt to punch holes through Russia’s daunting defensive network. Crucially, it was also unclear what kind of losses either side was suffering, in soldiers and weaponry.

What is clear is that Ukraine has significantly ratcheted up its seven-week-old counteroffensive, along two southward thrusts apparently aimed at cities in the Zaporizhzhia region: Melitopol, near the Sea of Azov, and Berdiansk, to the east, on the Azov coast. In both cases, the Ukrainians have advanced only a few miles so far and have dozens of miles to go.

In the short run, success would mean getting behind Russia’s defenses, where its forces would be far more vulnerable, and taking major towns farther south. Longer term, it would mean taking back Melitopol, a major transportation hub, or Berdiansk, an important port, or both — effectively cutting the Russian-occupied territory in half, complicating Moscow’s strategy and logistics.

The Ukrainian military said in a statement that its forces “continue to conduct an offensive operation in Melitopol and Berdiansk directions,” and that Russia had launched blistering artillery and aerial bombardments across southern Ukraine to repel the assault. Russian forces are focusing their “main efforts on preventing the further advance of Ukrainian troops,” it said.

American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday that the main part of Ukraine’s counteroffensive was underway, and that most of the units trained and equipped by the West for that purpose had been committed. But Russian officials described the assaults as considerably smaller, though aggressive and intense, and on Thursday, Ukrainian officials, also given anonymity, said that most of their reserve units were not yet in use.

One U.S. military official appeared to step back a bit from the earlier claim, saying on Thursday, “It remains to be seen what they’ll truly commit, when they’ll commit it and where.”
The United States and other Western allies have trained more than 63,000 Ukrainian troops in preparation for the counteroffensive and have provided thousands of armored vehicles, figures that continue to rise.

In the past, Mr. Putin had often gone weeks without publicly discussing battlefield events, but he has done so repeatedly in the weeks since a failed mutiny by the Wagner private military group, telegraphing that he is control.

In St. Petersburg, Russia, on Thursday, he took a break from meetings with African leaders to speak to Russian state television about what he insisted was a failing Ukrainian counteroffensive. He claimed, without offering evidence, that the Ukrainians had suffered heavy casualties and losses of armored vehicles — a frequent and often inflated Russian assertion.

Ukraine, maintaining operational secrecy, has not acknowledged that the offensive has entered a new phase, and it has repeatedly cautioned that progress will be slow and difficult. President Volodomyr Zelensky, in his late-night address on Wednesday, said only that there were “very good results today.”
The Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington, said in an analysis that Ukraine still had many units in reserve and that if American officials were correct that the main Ukrainian push had started, this was just the first element of it, “rather than the sum of such a thrust.”

“ Western officials are unhelpfully raising expectations for rapid and dramatic Ukrainian advances that Ukrainian forces are unlikely to be able to meet,” it added. While it still believes that “Ukrainian forces can make significant gains,” it said, those were “likely to occur over a long period of time and interspersed with lulls and periods of slower and more grinding efforts.”

The U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, speaking to reporters while visiting Papua New Guinea on Thursday, did not comment on the claims that the counteroffensive was in a new phase.

In the western thrust, the most intense fighting has been around the village of Robotyne, south of the town of Orikhiv, where Russian officials reported a “massive” Ukrainian assault on Wednesday and some Western analysts reported Ukrainian advances on Thursday.

On the eastern axis, the combat was centered on Staromaiorske, the southernmost in a string of villages that Ukraine has retaken since early June. A popular Russian war blogger, Aleksandr Khodakovsky, and Ukrainian officials both said on Thursday that Kyiv’s troops had seized the village in fierce fighting.

Mr. Khodakovsky, a pro-Russian separatist military commander in the Donetsk region before it was annexed by Moscow, said that Russian forces facing the Ukrainian assault were “already pretty battered and at a critical level of fatigue.” Rybar, another popular Russian pro-war blog, reported Ukrainian gains in Staromaiorske, and added that “there was practically nothing left” of the village.

Ukrainian Special Forces released video, verified by The New York Times, that appears to show Ukrainian troops taking Russian soldiers prisoner in Staromaiorske.

2d922fc13f931d435623a4bc1ef92e43,15bmr2w,jtryk6b,"The Kremlin on Wednesday and Thursday attacked airfields in western Ukraine with dozens of missiles, including some of the most expensive in its arsenal, Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, but the extent of damage was unclear.

Since seizing territory in southern Ukraine in their invasion last year, Russians have built a dense web of minefields, trenches, bunkers, tank traps and obstacles, and grinding through them has been slow, bloody work for the Ukrainian offensive.

The first two weeks of the operation last month were marked by heavy losses, so Ukrainian military commanders paused and adjusted, focusing more on degrading Russian forces with artillery and long-range missile strikes than penetrating enemy minefields under fire.

Day after day, the Ukrainian military reports on dozens of strikes aimed at taking out Russian command and control centers, ammunition depots, troop concentrations, air-defense systems, rocket launchers and logistical operations. In particular, Storm Shadow missiles, which are fired from a plane and have a range exceeding 155 miles, have had a big impact, according to Western officials and military analysts.
U.S. officials say the timing makes sense to intensify the Ukrainian offensive, including the progress the Ukrainians have made clearing paths through some of the Russian defenses, wearing down Russian troops and artillery, and weakening Russian infrastructure and resources behind the lines.

“The Russians are stretched,” a Western official said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational details and intelligence assessments. “They are still experiencing problems with logistics, supply, personnel and weapons. They’re feeling the pressure.”

American officials also cite the turmoil within the Russian military hierarchy since the failed mutiny last month by the Wagner group that had been fighting for the Kremlin. Leaders who have questioned the conduct of the war or are viewed as insufficiently loyal have been removed or reassigned.

But Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army major general, cautioned against making a snap assessment of the fighting, in part because Ukrainian forces were still a long way from being able to penetrate Russia’s main defensive lines.

It's nice because of the reasons you mentioned. As a reputable outlet their journalists disclose where they are getting their info from, and yes this includes anonymous sources. However, they'll make it clear whether it's coming from a high level source, and even better, they'll ask around amongst multiple sources and see whether those ones can also back up the claim, and then they'll report that. This is very standard in legitimate journalism, and is an accepted practice when it's done correctly like the NYT. The reader can decide ""well I'm gonna ignore everything from an anonymous source"" or they can weigh it accordingly and say something like ""well, NYT says it's from 1 source, so maybe I'll put a little weight in it"" vs. ""ok well NYT says it's 13 sources in high positions from 6 countries, I'm going to put a lot of weight in it"", etc. The key point is they're transparent about the nature of the sources (number, country, government, etc.) even without revealing the identity. Anonymous sourcing is integral to reporting on sensitive topics. Without them, you'd have no reporting on sensitive topics other than what is plainly visible, which means you'd have a fraction of the information you have access to with anonymous sources. And again, it goes back to being your own best judge of the information, and that's made possible by the transparency of a good outlet like the NYT vs. a random twitter account or a tabloid, or a clickbait mainstream digital-only outlet, etc.

Another nice thing, also on the topic of anonymous sources, is if you read the continued reporting over multiple hours/days, NYT will always keep  pressing their sources and they will update as they get more/new info. That's evidenced here in the article I linked. They did a follow up with one source they previously quoted, after having been confronted with new info, and found that this source added some hedging to their previous claims for clarity, which the NYT then included in this article. That's the kind of dedication and quality you will not get from an inferior outlet, much less Twitter anon ""osint"" accounts.",False,1690569148.0,t3_15bmr2w,t1_jts7h1x,,9,2,0,2,0,0,
