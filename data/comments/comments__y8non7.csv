Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 20 October 2022


- On 18 October 2022, recently appointed commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, General Sergei Surovikin, told Russian media that 'a difficult situation has emerged' in the Kherson area. He endorsed the previously announced plans of the occupation authorities to evacuate the civilian population.

- As the overall operational commander, Surovikin's announcement highlighting negative news about the special military operation' is highly unusual. It likely indicates that the Russian authorities are seriously considering a major withdrawal of their forces from the area west of the Dnipro river.

- A key challenge of any Russian withdrawal operation would be extracting troops and their equipment across the 1000m wide river in good order. With all the permanent bridges severely damaged, Russia would highly likely rely heavily on a temporary barge bridge it completed near Kherson in recent days, and military pontoon ferry units, which continue to operate at several locations.",False,1666251668.0,t3_y8non7,t3_y8non7,,0,51,0,51,0,0,

Day 239 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today was yet another quiet day with no missile strikes. Though there were a couple of times where we thought that Russians were firing their missiles from Belgorod in our direction, but thankfully they turned out to just be their air defenses trying to intercept something again. Other than that and some air raid alerts nothing much has happened, and that’s a good thing.

We had no rolling blackouts in Kharkiv today, and presumably we won’t have one tomorrow either, but they already started in some other cities. Just like it was for us, they started by completely turning off all the street illumination, and also limiting energy consumption for businesses. There could also be rolling blackouts for regular people, with up to 4 hours of no electricity, and they already happened in some places yesterday, but we don’t know if they will be happening here yet.

That news about Russia planning to blow up the Nova Kakhovka dam is definitely not great. The consequences would be catastrophic, it would be worse than using tactical nukes, and could potentially kill over 100k people, but it wouldn’t really stop our offensive in any meaningful way, and it would have much worse consequences for the Russians. Places that would flood are mostly the ones controlled by Russia; it would also stop water flowing to Crimea, and make it impossible for them to resupply Kherson. Blowing it up is just plain stupid, but there are a lot of stupid things they have already done, so they just might go for it.",False,1666314667.0,t3_y8non7,t3_y8non7,,0,145,0,145,1,0,

""Ukraine has been demystifying of the whole world for the last 8 months. No matter what it focuses on - a whole slew of imagined nonsense is blown away and everything gets shown in its true light.

When Ukraine focused on Russia - a horde, advancing simply due to a ten-fold number advantage, appeared instead of a superpower with 2nd most powerful army of the world. It hastily unpacks 60 year old tanks and cannons, and blows up village outhouses with expensive missiles.

When they touched on Germany - the largest economy in Europe with Bundeswehr turned into some sort of a bubble filled with cheap gas with a few underequipped brigades and cannons without ammunition.

They touched Boris Johnson - and a freak with a strange hairdoo turned into a fiery inheritor of Churchill, first to deliver real weapons, and behind him is a nation that accepts, trains, and helps both the civilians and the military.

When the touched the Russian ""opposition"" - it turned out that there is no opposition, ""don't force us to apologize, give us visas, money for propaganda, we have a very important clip about the apartment of the chief assistant of the junior referent of the seventh VP in Ust-Fartsk.""

When they touched Musk - an eccentric genius that attempts to conquer space for humankind turned out to be a complete as\*\*ole that read too much Russian propaganda. With a thin skin no less.

When they touched Israel - a small, but very proud country that protects its interests even in such cases as naming a stadium in Ternopil does not see anything wrong with the bombings of Babiy Yar. ""No, we bomb Iran because of Syria, but drones falling on Kyiv do not concern us.""

But the most telling was of course - when it touched itself - and instead of a heap of villagers with every house on the edge, it turned out to be a United Country, where everyone is collecting, buying, bringing, constructing, inventing anecdotes, yells at everyone - including themselves.

> My husband and I once spent eighteen months in a village 300 kilometers from Moscow, in the Kaluga province, which is relatively well supplied. The village population was noisy and querulous, they would pick up their knives at the slightest provocation. Every evening we would hear shouts – somebody’s chicken was stolen, somebody’s dog poisoned, someone’s wife seduced, somebody had been beaten and was now chasing his attackers with an axe. These were energetic, proud people.

> The village water system was only connected to a few lucky houses, but the majority of villagers had to carry their water in buckets from the street fountains. One cold, gray November day the fountains suddenly dried up. The nearest well was in the ravine whose slopes were slippery at this time of year. The usually boisterous and quarrelsome villagers, always ready to start a fight, trudged meekly into the ravine with their buckets.

> When I asked them how long the drought would last, they said: ‘Until spring.’ Assuming that the villagers knew best, we started packing our things to leave, but at the last moment I called the emergency maintenance service to check on the situation. My call was news to them. None of the villagers had informed them of the problem, even though there was a telephone in almost every house. The next day a team of workers arrived, repaired the water tower and restored the water supply. If it were not for my call, the villagers would have waited for water until spring.

> Something similar happened with the power supply. The outdated electricity network often went down, leaving the village immersed in darkness. The thing to do was to call the emergency service, but the villagers never would. While I was there, I played the role of a miracle-worker. If the light went out during the night, the villagers had to stay in the dark until I woke up closer to midday.

Zelensky laments ‘massive blackouts’ as fresh evidence on Nord Stream pipeline damage points to Putin

Wednesday October 19 2022, 7.45am, The Times

Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, made an urgent trip to Washington yesterday to hold talks with his US counterpart after Russia unleashed exploding drones on Kyiv.

Nearly a third of Ukraine’s power stations have been destroyed in the past week, President Zelensky said yesterday, warning his people of a tough winter ahead as Moscow shifted its war strategy to bombing infrastructure.

> When they touched on Germany - the largest economy in Europe with Bundeswehr turned into some sort of a bubble filled with cheap gas with a few underequipped brigades and cannons without ammunition.

Meanwhile Germany is one of the largest contributors of military aid. Aside from that, it's been well known for a long time that the German military was underfunded, this is not some type of big surprise for anyone that has been paying attention. They are fixing that now though with 100 billion euro 1 time injection and then 50 billion a year more.

> They touched Boris Johnson - and a freak with a strange hairdoo turned into a fiery inheritor of Churchill, first to deliver real weapons, and behind him is a nation that accepts, trains, and helps both the civilians and the military.

Giving credit to a political opportunist because the opportune thing this time happened to align with the right thing. What a joke.

> When the touched the Russian ""opposition"" - it turned out that there is no opposition, ""don't force us to apologize, give us visas, money for propaganda, we have a very important clip about the apartment of the chief assistant of the junior referent of the seventh VP in Ust-Fartsk.""

This is news to absolutely no-one. 

> When the touched Musk - an eccentric genius that attempts to conquer space for humankind turned out to be a complete as**ole that read too much Russian propaganda. With a thin skin no less.

Our electricty is approximately covered 60% by rivers and 30% by nuclear (shrinking, as reactors are old and not renewed). As nuclear shrinks solar and wind are supposed to cover the hole. Other sources are burning of wood and waste.
In Summer we can pretty much cover ourselves but we still import a lot as we use dams to store and sell energy (functioning as a transporter of electeicty from France/Germany to Italy). Come winter, the situation is different, as we import more and can't cover as much ourselves. Still, the dams allow us to import and use them as a responsive measure afterwards.

Electricity covers about 25% of the energy needs, the other 75% (oil, gas, fuels etc...) is mostly imported (exception being part of wood / waste used for heating. Gas mostly through Germany as far as I am aware. Currently, the fear is, that European countries might not deliver their end of the contracts, when they see shortages coming.

There are discussusions about re-legalizing nuclear and building new reactors, but I am scpetical if this will go through (would have to be voted for by the people) and it wouldn't help short term. Projects such as wind and solar parks (in the alps for example) take way too long due to communities not wanting them in their proximity and environmental groups protesting. Administrative process needs to be faster imo.. same would go for nuclear plants, not sure how long one would take, but I'm not optimistic.

Russian aircraft 'released missile' near British plane over Black Sea

A Russian aircraft released a missile near a British plane patrolling in international airspace over the Black Sea on 29 September, defence minister Ben Wallace has said.

Wallace told Parliament Britain had suspended patrols following the incident and expressed their concerns to Russia’s Defence minister Sergei Shoigu.

He said an “unarmed RAF RC-135 Rivet Joint” plane was “interacted with” by two Russian SU-27s, one of which “released a missile in the vicinity of the RAF Rivet Joint beyond visual range”.

Russia said it was a technical malfunction and Wallace said Britain has now resumed patrols. The patrols now have fighter aircraft escorts, he added.

The US public is pretty firmly behind aid for Ukraine, so the Republicans aren't going to just flip a switch and turn it off. What they've said is ""no blank cheque"" for Ukraine, which quite frankly is the case now already. The reason the Republicans are saying this is not because of compromat or some type of pro-Russian stance (though certainly there are a few among their ranks), it's simply because they must oppose anything the Democrats support. They are just reactionaries, nothing more. If they do take control of one of the two houses, certainly we can expect some rumblings and performative standoffs, but ultimately there will still be significant funding for Ukraine - most likely.

Secondly, the whole point of passing legislation for $50 billion now, is clearly to pre-empt any of that. The new Congress doesn't get seated until the end of January 2023, so by passing a budget for Ukraine before that, the Democrats can assure funding for the whole of 2023 essentially.

The truth is that the American people, by and large, don't care about this war to the degree that it's going to alter the elections.  This election is going to be about domestic issues, and decided on domestic issues.  Public support for Ukraine will be irrelevant in deciding who gets power.

Usually, when the American people don't care about an issue, its politicians have room to maneuver, and when American politicians have room to maneuver, they almost always move towards their donors.  In this case, those donors would be defense contractors, companies that build military hardware, who very much want this war to continue.

That's all well and good for Ukraine, but here's the tricky bit.  Trump wants the U.S. to get out of Ukraine, and Trump has a habit of making Republican voters care about shit that they wouldn't otherwise care about.   So, if Trump and his associates in right-wing media get Republican voters to demand the U.S. stop supporting Ukraine, and Republicans have power, they'll have to kowtow to that pressure, and the U.S. will stop or at least significantly reduce support for Ukraine.

Yes, absolutely. It's just that taking care of civilians in a war zone is a logistical challenge.

Sure, it's a huge victory, at least for a while, but there is still a long and arduous path ahead. Also, having closely followed the battlefield situation since the beginning of the war (I have relatives on the front lines), I am skeptical about a Kherson liberation in the next ten days. It will likely happen somewhere before the year-end, but Ukraine needs to progress in the region first, and it has not so far in terms of territory. Russians still hold Snihurivka, for instance, in Mykolaiv Oblast, which is possibly the most overextended position of Russia in the entire Ukraine territory: far from the Dnipro, surrounded by Ukrainian territory, with the Inhulets river around complicating their logistics. Still, Ukraine has shelled it for weeks to no avail. 

Unless the Russians retreat completely and suddenly, as they did in Kyiv at the beginning of the war, a “right bank” liberation will not come in ten days. First, a breakthrough to Nova Kakhova outskirts must be made (Ukraine is struggling with anything south of Dudchany/Davydiv Brid), then it needs to be liberated, and then Snihurivka must be liberated, which would allow for Kherson to be surrounded. That's how it happened for Lyman (a process that took three to four weeks **after** the liberation of Izium, with Ukraine liberating villages around it almost daily. Ukraine is not liberating anything for almost two weeks now), that is how it will likely be for Kherson. Unlikely that all this will happen in ten days (it could, but again, unlikely). Before anyone says ""but OPSEC?"", this is more regarding logistics/moves on the battlefield. If cities south of Dudchany/Davydiv Brid were liberated, we would know. UALivemap is 99.99% accurate regarding Kherson as of this moment. I would say that very likely yes, the Russian front will collapse south of Dudchany/Davydiv Brid at some point, and Ukraine will recover a lot of territories quickly. But again, this is a process that will take weeks once it has started, and it did not even start yet. 

Finally, for those who remember the Kharkiv offensive in detail, it started with the liberation of Balakliia, which took more or less 3 days. Once an equivalent event happens in Kherson (e.g. I would guess Snihurivka, but can be Beryslav or around Davydiv Brid), then yes, expect a “full liberation” of the right bank in 10 days. Until then, assume it is one/two months away.",1666262453.0,1666254600.0,t3_y8non7,t1_it1jy65,,3,4,0,4,0,0,

Um; yeah. Fukushima would like a word with you.

the zirconium cladding on the fuel rods will split hydrogen from oxygen in the cooling water, when it's about 1200 ˚C (https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/47/032/47032411.pdf ) which usually causes an explosion.  This is what initially blew the shit out of the reactors in Fukushima, spreading radiation across the region.

This can happen in an active reactor core that has been shut down, and then deprived of coolant.

Now; if the fuel has been in shutdown for more than a few months, the peak temperature won't really get that hot.  And if you remove the fuel from the reactor and store it in a cooling pond; that also mitigates it, but what can happen in these cases (and DID happen at Fukushima) is the water can boil-off, and then the uncooled fuel-rods can heat up and catch fire, which will also spread shit tons of radiation.

You want to listen for ideas of Russian Emperism and the notion of the ""Glory of War."" That's not a specific term, just the one my brain is using to describe the idea that war brings about national improvement in some way. Russia as saviors via war a centuries old propaganda technique. Expanding is saving. War is good. Suffering for your country is good. Etc. I picked the first thing that popped up on my scribd. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it over any other. 

 The Long Hangover: Putin's Russia and the ghosts of the past is great. But be prepared to be shocked and have your heart strings pulled occasionally. He discusses a lot of how today's propaganda in Russia ties to the soviet union in some ways... but completely covers it up in others. He interviews people, and takes you on his travels. 10/10. 

For Putin you want to read his speeches, like the Munich one, but his interviews are good too. Just get an idea for how he talks about things himself, vs how other people say he does. For example I don't hear putin referring to soviet russia, nearly as he does the Russian Empire. Putin's Kleptocracy is good too. 

I listened to Putins interviews with Oliver Stone. He heavily guarded his words, but it was interesting to hear him banter and talk about relationships. I thought a strong need to feel wanted comes through. Wanting the world to want Russia. Feeling hurt when they don't. Lashing out when they don't. Yachts, tourism, etc.

Jan 6 was the first step, an attempt at normalization. Eventually they'll do enough that it just becomes a part of regular political discourse. To assume that the fascists will stop because of a botched coup attempt is optimism to an unhealthy extent. The goal is always normalization of violence, extremism and to make the whole thing seem far more reasonable than before it happened. They were mostly successful in that regard. 

The Italian fascists worked in a very similar manner back in the day, until eventually Mussolini could stand up in the parliament and admit that he did all the murders and political violence he was accused of organizing and all they could do in response was give him even more power.

there is waaay too much going on with the MAGA/GOP civil war and all the things they have done to turn any sensible American against them for them to pull out a win. The MAGA KULT may enthrall ~ 30% of the population but thats not enough to win when we keep having record turnout in response to their idiocy. 

Now their beloved leader is mired in more criminal investigations than he can count, Jan 6 is spreading his shame, and CoVid decimated far more red voters than blue. and thats before you even get to the Roe impact.

Ive got no doubt record turnout will destroy the Republican hopes, hell normally red Georgia is proving me right right now with record early voting, and those are mostly Dems. Blood red Kansas also had record turnout (especially women) just a few months ago to keep abortion access there. Im counting it and will revisit anyone who tries to argue with me after election Day to discuss.

""Georgia voters surpassed the day two 2020 Presidential Election record for Early Voting. As of Wednesday morning, just over 268,000 Georgia voters have cast their ballot during in-person Early Voting, with 134,005 showing up on Tuesday, October 18th. Tuesday’s total marks a 75.3% increase from day two of 2018 midterm early voting, and an astounding 3.3% increase over the second day of Early Voting in the 2020 Presidential Election.

Georgia has had record early voting turnout since the first day of Early Voting this year, surging to nearly twice the number on the first day of Early Voting in 2018.

2021: We estimate that 50% of young people, ages 18-29, voted in the 2020 presidential election, a remarkable 11-point increase from 2016 (39%) and likely one of the highest rates of youth electoral participation since the voting age was lowered to 18. Our new estimate is based on newly available voter file data in 41 states—AK, DC, HI, MD, MS, NH, ND, UT, WI, WY do not have reliable vote history data by age. This analysis replaces our earlier estimate, released immediately after Election Day, which estimated a 5 to 11 point increase in youth voter turnout compared to 2016 based on data available in that moment.

https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016

A November 6 analysis from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University shows that youth voter turnout (ages 18 to 29) surged by around 8 percent this year compared to 2016. Based on the conservative end of CIRCLE’s preliminary estimate, 53 percent of eligible youth voters cast votes in this election versus 45 percent in 2016.

That's the wrong argument. Your point was the Obama did more drone strikes and therefore Obama = bad. My point was that it's documented that these drone strikes were supported by local populations and therefore an increase in drone strikes doesn't automatically disqualify them. I did not say anything about the drone strikes under Bush. Additionally, the rise in drone strikes is explainable simply by the maturing of the technology between the Bush and Obama administrations, as well as the evolving nature of the conflict.

Your reasoning is laughably simplistic and doesn't hold water under any type of scrutiny. 

> An accusation ""Enlightened centrism!"" is what people say when they want to take a cheap shot because they have nothing of value to say. The reality is his foreign policy was little different to Bush's or Trump's.

This is just disingenuous reasoning. Bush choose to invade Afghanistan and Iraq for for fun and profit, in the case of Iraq with falsified evidence. Obama inherited that mess, that's a huge difference. Trump then essentially [removed a bunch of controls](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/trumps-secret-rules-for-drone-strikes-and-presidents-unchecked-license-to-kill) from the drone strikes and started hitting targets wantonly. Obama specifically took the responsibility to have the final say in drone strikes because he realized the responsibility that came with it. Trump cozied up to Putin and Kim Jong-Un and picked fights with Europe and NATO, to the point of causing a strategic rift between the EU/US upsetting the post WWII order that was only healed (perhaps temporarily) due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. To classify their foreign policies as similar is mindbogglingly stupid.

I'm not sure what your definition of ""tabloid"" is, but for years it referred to the dimensions of the print publication, with ""gutter press"" preferring the small [tabloid format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_(newspaper_format)) and ""serious newspapers"" preferring the large [broadsheet format](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadsheet).  From 1821 to 2005, The Guardian was printed in the broadsheet format, whereupon it switched to the Berliner format; in 2018 it switched to the Compact format (as is The Times and as was The Independent).

The Guardian is considered to be one of the UK's four [newspapers of record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_of_record) by reputation (the other three being The Daily Telegraph, The Times and The Financial Times).  That is perhaps the best recognition of authority and independence that a newspaper can have.

Moreover, unlike the other newspapers of record, The Guardian is unique in being not for profit, instead established to reinvest all monies into journalism with the intention of upholding journalistic independence and integrity.  As a consequence, The Guardian have conducted and published some of the best investigative journalism in the world, for which they have received numerous awards.  It remains one of the UK's most trusted news sources.

The Guardian has a centre-left lean, which together with its strong editorial independence has led to it being despised by those on the right of the body politic.
