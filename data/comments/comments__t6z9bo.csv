He was arrested and went to a Spanish court. He explained himself, said he didn't regret it, and would do it again. 

They let him go. 

The kicker at the end of the story was that he has now gone back to Ukraine and is currently awaiting to be issued a weapon so he can join the fight.

For those unfamiliar with Reddit Live Threads, there are two parts. The comments section, which is where you are now, and the [Live Feed Ticker](https://www.reddit.com/live/18hnzysb1elcs), which everyone is commenting on. Sometimes the ticker isn't obvious, especially if you're a masochist and use the official Reddit app. Thanks to /u/low_iq_opinion for the hint about this, great point for those new to these things.

&nbsp;

- The convoy NW of Kyiv hasn't moved. It's a combination of stuck, broken down, run out of fuel and the front has been attacked
- NATO is an ostensibly *defensive* alliance, they're not getting involved because Ukraine isn't a NATO member and NATO has *no business* there†. Sucks for Ukraine, but the alternative is an immediate escalation from Russia and even more conflict in other places, therefore more suffering. This is the trolley problem on a country scale. Russia is the trolley, Ukraine is the single person on the track. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO
- A No Fly Zone cannot be established over Ukraine by NATO or any other country. To do so requires air superiority to start with, and the ability to enforce the zone. That means firing upon Russian aircraft that encroach, or zone-enforcing aircraft being fired upon by Russian AA, which results in immediate escalation and conflict. See item 2. Read more here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60576443
- Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is a strategy/policy of nuclear deterrence whereby a given country's defence against a nuclear attack is to assure the attackers that they would also be annihilated. Nuclear weapons are typically delivered by Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that literally fly into space to travel half way around the world and hit their target. Launch to impact takes up to 30 minutes. Thus, any would-be attacker is guaranteed a fiery nuclear death as their target will also launch a retaliatory strike before the attackers missiles launch. No-one wins, so no-one initiates. Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction
- Ain't no fucking fool dropping tactical nukes on anyone. To do so would result in an immediate escalation to full-blown nuclear exchange. If the nukes start flying, it'll be all of them going everywhere. Unlikely to happen, but if it does then everyone is fucked so don't even dedicate any time to worrying about it. See previous point.
- The West/Europe can't send Ukraine planes that they're not familiar with. These are not family hatchbacks that any dick with a license can drive. Flying a particular type of aircraft requires months of familiarisation and training. 

Anything else?

&nbsp;

EDIT:

Thanks to /u/Bored_guy_in_dc for the suggestion of covering the principles of MAD

† I added the word ""ostensibly"" to the description of NATO being a defensive allience. Per /u/FlaviusDomitianus's reply, there are historical cases where NATO got involved with non-NATO conflicts, the reasons and merits of which can no doubt be debated to death but are arguably not relevant here. As shitty as it seems, NATO not getting directly involved in Ukraine is the right call.

Odessa is such a beautiful port city and the people are kind. I loved seeing my family and we were even planning a family vacation again this year to see them since my grandma is 85 and has early dementia.

I had 2 beautiful baby girls within the past 2 years and it was my dream for my grandma and my Ukrainian family to get to meet them. 

Now I don’t even know if I will get to see them alive (my brother recruited to be in the Ukrainian military and my grandmother can’t find medication for hypertension and other conditions since all the pharmacies are closed) and I’m genuinely not sure how Odessa will get hit in the coming days. They tried to leave but my Ukrainian family are animal lovers and they have a bunch of dogs and cats and they couldn’t bare leaving them plus my grandma uses a walking cain and is overweight so it’s hard for her to barely walk down the steps of her Soviet apartment building let alone go through the stress of figuring out to escape the country. 

What makes matters worse is that if they somehow survive all of this war bullshit and Ukraine becomes fully occupied by Russia they will probably never get to see me me or my babies again since travel will forever be restricted if you try traveling to the us to Russia.

On one hand, they’ve almost single-handedly stopped any major conflicts directly between superpowers, as the threat of WW3 and nuclear holocaust is too great. A conventional massive-scale war is pretty much impossible.

That being said, on the OTHER hand, nukes are solely responsible for some crazy-ass dictators being able to get away with almost whatever they want. The brightside to this is, the world can see the firsthand effects of economic sanctions as a deterrent to war, preventing more needless death.

You have build yourself an international reputation, where despite being a dictator where until 2014, people look up to you as superior to the ""inefficient"" western leaders, including people in the west. You have the entirety of Latin America's population eating from your hand as they see you as a counter for the USA, which has oppressed them. You tanked your reputation significantly with a 2014 invasion, but the minds and hearts you have won in the west remain significant. You own a troll army and propaganda aparatus able to sway elections in the world's only superpower and put your guy in the White House. Overall, you have managed the world to begrudgingly accept your 2014 fiasco.

Faith in the European Union and western institutions are at its lowest. An extremely unpopular president runs the United States, and it seems you will be able to again seat your guy in the White House again. Furthermore, a populist is set to win in France's next elections diving the EU even further.

A lot of people see you as the definition of ""based"". You have successfully cultivated the image of a manly macho guy, the strongest bravest world leader. People see you as having lifted Russia from the soviet collapse, into an, even if still third world, decent economy. You are listed for years as Forbes most powerful person in the world, above the president of the United States. The entire world is in awe of your military might, indeed some consider your armed forces to be #2 of the entire planet. The opinion that if it wasn't for the United States, your army would be able to overrun everything from Ukraine to France in a year or less is not an unpopular opinion.

Stop being so damn scared people. The world won't end. I am an army reservist in a NATO country bordering russia, I don't want war  but we have to be real about what is going in here. The way I see it; if we just stick our heads in the sand and say: 'well he'll use nukes' every time russia tries to upend the world to gain more power we might as well disband NATO and submit. 

1. There is no guarantee it will go nuclear, because that would also entail russia being glassed. Putin has been playing the same card every fucking time someone breathes his way and it's time we say enough.


2. He won't stop here. Moldova is next, and who is to say he wont go for Finland, Georgia or even the Baltic states, after all, we don't want nuclear war. Power drunk dictators with a wish to restore what was aren't typically rational people that say 'okay, I've had my fill'. 


3. No one is suggesting rolling our tanks into Moscow, it's real tangible support for Ukraine that is the discussion. Suggesting all out war is just the enablers' and cowards' strawman, because take away and netflix on the couch might be threatened.


4. I am not nor have I ever been a war hawk and find the concept of war completely obselete and barbaric. However, not doing sonething is doing something. The war won't go away, the long term ramifications won't go away and imperialist ultranationalists won't go away. The only way to stop this type of behaviour is beating them at the game they pride themselves in being so good at. If russia is bitchwhipped in a few months tine in Ukriane with western support Putins cool aid might start tasting a little artificial for some.


5. As a closing note, I want to return to the question of nukes and ramifications. Russia said they would treat being shut out of SWIFT as an act of war, but last I checked I wasn't glowing and there are no T90s in my back yard. They said the same about support with weapons and other material, but we haven't been shelled yet. Your fear, which is understandable, makes you not consider the full picture, which is; Russia and Putin fucking lies so much that you could bet on them misreporting the weather. It was just military excercises, the invasion was western hysteria, Ukraine is run by nazis, we will declare war on anyone supporting Ukraine, the consequences of helping will bring consequences never seen before, there is no war, we have never hurt civilians.

He's done and is still doing anything he can to help his people, from practically begging for help to making it v clear how serious he is about them joining NATO/EU. I doubt he's slept more than a couple of hours a night since this started, he's under a tremendous amount of stress, his country is being bombed to the ground, his people are being butchered right in front of his eyes, and what he desperately needs--actual boots on the ground, actual protection, actual people fighting besides him--is something he's being told again and again the West can't give him, and to make matters even more frustrating it's pretty clear NATO armies would v easily cut through the russian armies and stop the devastation they're waging in Ukraine. It's nerve-wracking to me, and I'm all the way across Europe and have no special connection to Ukraine. I can't imagine how much worse it is to him.

But here's the thing--it /is/ something the West can't give. NATO implementing a NFZ means NATO shooting down russian planes, which means everyone being dragged into WWIII. Which comes with a very serious possibility of nukes, which really won't make anything better for anyone, including Ukraine. Honestly, maybe especially Ukraine, since they're right in the middle of Russia/the West. 

And lbr there are a lot of times where the West has been completely useless, and while it is not a distinction I expect Zelenskiy to make, those of us who are not as emotionally involved in this really should know better. We're arming Ukraine nonstop, taking their refugees, providing aid, waging economic war on Russia, sharing intelligence... like this isn't doing nothing. This is pretty much doing everything within our power to do short of putting boots on the ground, which seems to be where NATO draws the line.

I also feel like we all need to remember that world leaders as a general rule get a lot of information/intelligence reports that we are not privy to, and probably have a much clearer picture on Putin's state of mind and what the stakes actually are here than any of us armchair psychiatry/war/nuclear experts on reddit.",1646452363.0,1646449788.0,t3_t6z9bo,t3_t6z9bo,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

I'm confused.  So russia is taking senior officers and putting them up front, which puts them in greater danger and has already resulted in 3 of their deaths.

This is *also* something the US did?  The US took experienced officers and put them up front, causing their deaths?  Or ISIS put its officers up front and US seized the opportunity?  Maybe the US put officers up front and they didn't get picked off?

I'm confused because it seems to paint it as a good move, or something the US did successfully (maybe I'm reading subtext that isn't there).

&#x200B;

I've come to the conclusion the *""but nuclear war""* thing, oft-repeated on Reddit, is a very convenient excuse that NATO is using to not directly get involved, because they've done the political calculus and decided that Ukraine just isn't important enough to put any skin in the game on. And it's much easier to cite the potential of nuclear conflict or ""WWIII"" and come out looking morally justified than admitting that, to a Western geopolitical perspective, Ukraine just isn't particularly relevant to the West. Nuclear hysteria is an *incredibly* easy pill for an uninformed public to swallow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**1)** Another war in the west would be political suicide right now, especially in the US, after just spending the last couple decades embroiled in increasingly unpopular low-intensity conflict. Getting into another war that's halfway round the world, when we aren't even a year removed from the last is a guaranteed L come the next election cycle.

&#x200B;

**2)** Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to Western geopolitical interests (regardless of what Putin seems to think), and the balance of power isn't meaningfully shifted regardless of who controls it.

&#x200B;

**3)** The war in Ukraine is rapidly shifting opinions in Finland and Sweden about NATO membership...and unlike Ukraine, they *are* wealthy, NATO-integrated, strategically relevant allies and partners. A quick resolution might end that momentum, doubly so because if NATO comes to non-NATO members' rescue, then why bother contributing the necessary amount of GDP to defense and following all the other rules?

&#x200B;

**4)** While NATO loses very little by letting Ukraine fall, letting Ukrainians grind down Russia into military irrelevance is very much in NATO's interest; and the cost in weapons (or ""lethal aid"" as we call it) to do that is miniscule compared to the payoff. This is especially relevant for the the US, as a Russia that's weakened financially by heavy sanctions and militarily by intense resistance is a Russia the US has to spend less resources defending Europe from, allowing a more complete pivot Eastward.

&#x200B;

**5)** Finally, though it almost certainly would not mean nuclear annihilation, it does elevate the risk of that some, but much more significantly there is the potential for direct military action to escalate into a much wider, costly conflict. If prosecuted, this wider conflict would largely be a wasted effort, because it wouldn't accomplish any strategic goals that point 4 is already going to wrap up neatly at considerably less cost to manpower, materiel, and exposure of modern technologies and tactics to observers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is some fucking *cruel* realpolitik at hand, and it ignores the tremendous amount of suffering and the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Ukrainian civilians. It ignores the genuine right of the Ukrainian people to live their lives free of outside interference as they please, electing the people they choose to lead them.   And I *genuinely* think that a number of elected officials in office are hiding behind nuclear hysteria as a way of getting out of having to sincerely address the above points, while still coming across as compassionate.  There are enough historical precedents of non-nuclear conflicts between nuclear powers and instances of direct hostility throughout the Cold War and all its associated proxy conflicts, that the *actual* threat of  ""WWIII"" alone for a defensive operation of limited scope on NATO's part is acceptably low.  It's the other factors I listed that really make the decision clear.

&#x200B;

To illustrate that, were any of what's happening to Ukraine be happening to Poland, there would be a fierce, direct defensive response regardless of the nuclear risk... not because Poland is an inherently more important country than Ukraine on its own virtues, but because an unanswered Article 5 challenge is, geopolitically, the end of Western hard power hegemony, and that is **absolutely** worth all of the above risks and potential consequences and more.

&#x200B;

If things are going so well for UKR, why is Zelensky asking for a no-fly zone?

The press seems to be coming around to the strategic problems Ukraine is facing: From: ""Across Ukraine, Russian forces are pressing ahead, laying siege to cities and trying to control vital ports...""

The Russian military's tactical and logistical issues, and material losses and casualties, are not preventing it from grinding along with its offensive. Ukrainian forces are undoubtedly taking losses on par with Russian forces. And its logistical and material issues are real.

Just because the Russian offensive hasn't gone as nearly every analyst thought it should have gone doesn't mean it isn't working. The Russians are gaining ground and squeezing the Ukrainian forces from three sides.

The Ukrainian government and military have hard choices to make. And needs to make these hard choices now. It is in a bind: as it tries to defends everything, it is in effect defending nothing. At some point it has to decide what exactly it is that it wants to defend.

With that said if they can sustain it long enough, are willing to soak enough losses, kill enough civilians, they are perfectly capable of taking Kyiv, Kharkiv and any other city they wish. They have the numbers and the capability (at least on paper) to do so.

With that said, there's a lot of doubt about whether or not the Russians CAN do this. They are clearly demoralized and ill supplied. They are facing a determined resistance that will cost them men and material. There have been massive miscalculations which continue to effect decision making.

TLDW; Massive amounts of natural resources discovered in Ukraine, particularly relating to energy. After the revolution in Ukraine in 2014 replaced the pro-russia Ukrainian government with a pro-western one, a path for Ukraine going over to NATO seemed likely. This would push NATO right up to Russia's borders close to Moscow and in the case of a land war would be very very difficult to defend, especially with Belarus sticking far behind NATO lines. If Ukraine was friendly to Russia, look at how much of an advantage the Carpathian mountains would give Russia. Simultaneously, Ukraine with it's newfound energy resources would, with western investment, be able to supply massive amounts of energy to Europe, and Russia would lose it's largest source of income. These two things would comepletely ruin Russia. The people would come for the hoarded wealth of Putin and the oligarchy.

Putin has become the rat from his youth, and now all he can do is lash out.

If he wants to remain in power, and given all of his previous actions and decisions, invading Ukraine and preventing NATO membership while taking control of the resources off the coast of Crimea and on Ukrainian land is the logical decision.

That's not to say this is the only possible course of events. If he wasn't such a backstabbing scum fuck and NATO wasn't necessary then none of those actions would have ever been on the table.",1646457235.0,1646456673.0,t3_t6z9bo,t1_hzewoft,,1,1,0,1,0,0,

Nuclear conflict is highly unlikely to happen. A world war in the modern era would not need nuclear arms to cause death and destruction far beyond that of the previous 2. 

Sacrificing millions of people, or even risking such without trying to do everything possible first, is unquestionably the worst evil of all outcomes.

Ukraine *can* be successful if NATO and the US begin giving them what they need to defend their nation and their people, and the strangulation of Putin’s autocracy *can* succeed if it is happening in that environment and if the world sticks to it.

Both sides can be right in their position and still disagree, but both sides can also still work through it for a better result somewhere in the middle that doesn’t make things vastly worse, and lead to 20 Ukraines and millions dead all over the planet.

56f4add4282af80ed71e6f98d6da1a10,t6z9bo,hzemb12,"This is a bit long, but I wanted to add to your thoughts with some of my own:

I've come to the conclusion the ""but nuclear war"" thing is a very convenient excuse that NATO is using to not directly get involved because they've done the political calculus and decided that Ukraine just isn't important enough to put any skin in the game on.   And it's much easier to cite the potential of nuclear conflict or ""WWIII"" and come out looking morally justified than admitting that, to a Western geopolitical perspective, Ukraine just isn't particularly relevant to the West.   Nuclear hysteria is an *incredibly* easy pill for an uninformed public to swallow.

&#x200B;

**1)**  Another war in the west would be political suicide right now, especially in the US, after just spending the last couple decades embroiled in increasingly unpopular low-intensity conflict.  Getting into another war that's halfway round the world, when we aren't even a year removed from the last is a guaranteed L come the next election cycle.

&#x200B;

**2)** Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to Western geopolitical interests (regardless of what Putin seems to think), and the balance of power isn't meaningfully shifted regardless of who controls it.

&#x200B;

**3)** The war in Ukraine is rapidly shifting opinions in Finland and Sweden about NATO membership...and unlike Ukraine, they *are* wealthy, NATO-integrated, strategically relevant allies and partners.   A quick resolution might end that momentum, doubly so because if NATO comes to non-NATO members' rescue, then why bother contributing the necessary amount of GDP to defense and following all the other rules?

&#x200B;

**4)** While NATO loses very little by letting Ukraine fall, letting Ukrainians grind down Russia into military irrelevance *is very much* in NATO's interest; and the cost in weapons (or ""lethal aid"" as we call it)  to do that is miniscule compared to the payoff.  This is especially relevant for the the US, as a Russia that's weakened financially by heavy sanctions and militarily by intense resistance is a Russia the US has to spend less resources defending Europe from, allowing a more complete pivot Eastward.

&#x200B;

**5)** Finally, though it almost certainly would not mean nuclear annihilation, it does elevate the risk of that some, but much more significantly there is the potential for direct military action to escalate into a much wider, costly conflict.   If prosecuted, this wider conflict would largely be a wasted effort, because it wouldn't accomplish any strategic goals that point 4 is already going to wrap up neatly at considerably less cost to manpower, materiel, and exposure of modern technologies and tactics to observers.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is some fucking *cruel* realpolitik at hand, and it ignores the tremendous amount of suffering and the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Ukrainian civilians.  And I genuinely think that a number of elected officials in office are hiding behind nuclear hysteria as a way of getting out of having to sincerely address the above points, while still coming across as compassionate.   Were any of what's happening to Ukraine be happening to Poland, there would be a fierce, direct response regardless of the nuclear risk... not because Poland is an inherently more important country than Ukraine on its own virtues, but because an unanswered Article 5 challenge is, geopolitically, the end of Western hard power hegemony, and that is absolutely worth all of the above risks and potential consequences and more.

However, from a geopolitical standpoint, there's really just not justifiable method of implementing a no-fly zone over Ukriane and it is **precisely** because of NATO.

Russia's pretext for its invasion focused specifically on NATO expansion. Looking through recent history real quick, he cites the war in the Balkans as well as the Libyan Civil War as incidences where NATO acted as an offensive force. To his credit, both conflicts took place in non-NATO countries therefore can't necessarily be categorized as defensive measures (let's keep in mind that NATO is a defensive alliance, not an offensive one).

The reason that NATO won't provide air support is far simpler than the risk of sparking a nuclear conflict. The reality is: if NATO goes through with the measure, Putin will be able to claim that the alliance is indeed an offensive security threat to Russia (regardless of the fact that he started this war).

Apart from Canada, the US, Europe and maybe Japan, the other countries in the world aren't necessarily anti-Russia. They give at least some credence to whatever lie Putin slings.

**TL;DR** NATO can't go through with a no-fly zone because it risks painting them as an aggressor in the conflict and many other countries could lose both interest or belief in their side of the story.

Edit: to further touch on the TL;DR: this conflict I'd all about legitimacy for the west. They need the rest of the world to see Putin for what he really is: a dangerous, unpredictable dictator.

There is a chance any conflict with Russia goes nuclear, but more than that, a no-fly zone means a hot war with Russia.  Even if it stays purely conventional a lot of Americans would by dying in the skies over Ukraine.  American missile crews operating in neighboring countries would be legitimate targets of war.  The Russian navy could start targeting American ships and there could very well be a naval battle in Baltic Sea.  

I think a lot of people assume that the US would just swat aside Russia like we did to Saddam in 1991 and 2003.  This shows a lack of understanding of the technical aspects of an air war.  Whatever is going on with Russia that is making them so sluggish and inept in Ukraine is not guaranteed to pervade their entire military, nor last indefinitely.  Americans who are rooting for this need to understand that they're rooting for something that could very possibly end in thousands of American deaths, even if it stays fully conventional.  

I too am distressed by the West's apparent real-politic acceptance of Ukraine's resistance eventually devolving into an insurgency.  I think every effort should be made to supply them with planes and missiles and materials, and whatever is holding up this Polish Mig deal needs to be rammed through.

I think though that the clear intention to target civilians and nuclear infrastructure calls for something more - a no fly zone, with fair warning before being implemented, perhaps a week, for the sake of protecting Ukrainian lives, might be enough to make Putin call this off, and is more than justified both due to Ukraine's stated intentions to join NATO and the implications that Geneva convention holders should work to prevent its violation.

 >The basic principles of war propaganda (Principes élémentaires de propagande de guerre)  is a monograph by Anne Morelli published in 2001. It has not been translated into English. The subtitle recommends its ""usability in case of cold war, hot war and lukewarm war"" (Utilisables en cas de guerre froide, chaude ou tiède). The ten ""commandments"" of propaganda which Anne Morelli elaborates in this work are, above all, an analytical framework for pedagogical purposes and for media analysis.

Morelli explains this principle or commandment as follows: ""With rare exceptions, people tend to join the victorious cause. In the case of war, the preference of public opinion depends very much on the apparent results of the conflict.

Business don't raise prices every time the US dollar goes up and down. The value of the ruble initially only impacts international trade. The stock market being closed initially only impacts people who own stocks in that market (not all of which are Russians).

Russia also has a pretty isolated economy. They can still produce food and basic necessities internally. Whatever is happening globally doesn't impact that right away.

Long term, the financial pinch will trickle down and scarcity for the things (often raw materials) that Russia cannot produce internally will increase prices among all goods.

Trump reportedly said he wanted to pull the US from NATO multiple times last year
PUBLISHED TUE, JAN 15 2019 12:47 AM EST
UPDATED TUE, JAN 15 2019 7:27 AM EST

U.S. President Donald Trump privately said a number of times in 2018 that he wanted the U.S. to leave NATO, according to the New York Times.

The U.S. leader made headlines last year when he hinted that he could leave the defense bloc without Congressional approval before eventually saying that U.S. withdrawal was ""unnecessary.""
Many fear NATO could fall apart if the world's largest economy is no longer a member.

Big problem for big brain Vlad is that most of that $630b he had saved he was keeping on ledgers in New York and Frankfurt and London. He assumed for whatever reason that that money was off limits. Whoops!! 

So, now Russia has an expensive war and all the money it saved up vaporized in seconds. Plus the bank sanctions basically say to companies that if you move money to do business in Russia you do so at your great peril. So a lot of companies rather than navigate the web of sanctions and hope that their transaction w a Russian company is OK or else risk huge penalties if it turns out they were connected w the oligarchs.

With foreign trade gone, international travel for Russians eliminated, and a war chest that they can’t touch, their economy isn’t looking so hot. So that brings up to the ruble which - thanks to restrictions on export of foreign currency - is quickly becoming the only game in town and it can only buy the very limited goods (beyond base commodities) that Russia makes. At that point Russia let’s the ruble printer go brrrrr which does nothing but give them the appearance of meeting things like pension obligations even though the resulting inflation makes those rubles even more worthless. 

Way over simplified

*it gets better too bc Vlad assumed oil and gas were off limits too. That constitutes 30% (and that’s not accounting for the sanctions, which are drying up w big chunk of the remaining 70%). I certainly hope we prove his assumption wrong.  Vlad has put Ukrainians in line for bread and soon he will put the Russians there too.

If you don’t want the risk of being sent to war, don’t join the military.
Voting citizens of a democratic nation get a voice as to whether the use of their military is justified or not. This is a basic principle of civilian control over the military.



Intervention on the side of a legitimate democracy against an expansion minded authoritarian dictator who invaded under false pretenses, now indiscriminately bombing civilian areas, is perhaps the most morally justified use of force I can imagine.

 >Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike). It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy's use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.
 
**[Dead Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Hand)** 
 
 >Dead Hand (Russian: Система «Периметр», Systema ""Perimetr"", lit. ""Perimeter"" System, with the GRAU Index 15E601, Cyrillic: 15Э601), also known as Perimeter, is a Cold War-era automatic nuclear weapons-control system (similar in concept to the American AN/DRC-8 Emergency Rocket Communications System) that was used by the Soviet Union. The system remains in use in the post-Soviet Russian Federation.

First scenario is Russia decides not to escalate. They accept the loss of air support over Ukraine and continue the war.

Second scenario, Russia thinks it's a bluff and calls it. Continues air operations as usual. One of their planes gets shot down, they don't immediately know by what so either other planes or Russian air defenses shoot at, and potentially shoot down, A NATO aircraft. 

This activates article six of the NATO charter, which essentially says that attacking NATO owned assets, even if they are outside their country, is the same as attacking the country itself, which activates article five, which means NATO is at war with Russia. 

Now this scenario goes three ways, either Russia finds out they shot down a NATO aircraft and backs down immediately, NATO  sees the Russians called their bluff and back down, or they both double down and start an air war, which would quickly turn into a ground war as both sides need to take out the others air defenses, some of which will be located in home countries such as Poland and Russia. Which means, WW3.

Honestly, I say if we are gonna go as far as a no fly zone, just declare war on Russia. Your already betting they won't shoot down your planes and start a war, so you might as well just gamble they won't launch nukes in a war. Atleast that way you get to plan the offensive instead of sitting around waiting for Russia to kick it off when they are comfortable.

Now obviously, I think all this would be a horrendously bad idea. The last thing Ukraine needs is more soldiers fighting over their country. A full on ground war between Russia and NATO will result in more Ukranians dying, not less.

If we really want to help militarily without starting WW3, send in SOF as military volunteers. Ukraine is getting Intel from the west anyway, so really they are just changing uniforms. Hell, could even send in pilots as volunteers, then send Ukraine modern jets, Ukraine just gets lucky that some of their volunteers could fly their brand new planes, wasn't the plan all along or anything. 

They already have 16,000 volunteers coming over. Chances of a few of them being recently retired SOF or fighter pilots is non zero (probably fairly high since these are the exact type of people to volunteer to go to a war zone), so it gives plausible deniability, and helps prevent war.

Don't get me wrong, the Russians will know it's all a ruse, but they can't do anything about it unless they want to start a war. These people volunteered to fight for the Ukranians government, what's Russia gonna do?

>  
>I've come to the conclusion the ""but nuclear war"" thing, oft-repeated on Reddit, is a very convenient excuse that NATO is using to not directly get involved, because they've done the political calculus and decided that Ukraine just isn't important enough to put any skin in the game on. And it's much easier to cite the potential of nuclear conflict or ""WWIII"" and come out looking morally justified than admitting that, to a Western geopolitical perspective, Ukraine just isn't particularly relevant to the West. Nuclear hysteria is an incredibly easy pill for an uninformed public to swallow.

Nuclear war is a very real threat, it's the reason development of them accelerated so much, that whole Cold War thing, duck & cover for a whole generation, etc. Of course Putin's threats are likely in vein, but that is absolutely a primary reason no one is stopping them. It's why NATO was comfortable in Kosovo in the 90s; no one could nuke them back.

&#x200B;

>1) Another war in the west would be political suicide right now, especially in the US, after just spending the last couple decades embroiled in increasingly unpopular low-intensity conflict. Getting into another war that's halfway round the world, when we aren't even a year removed from the last is a guaranteed L come the next election cycle.

What? Public opinion would be overwhelmingly in favor of direct military involvement against Big Bad Russia. 

&#x200B;

>2) Ukraine is strategically irrelevant to Western geopolitical interests (regardless of what Putin seems to think), and the balance of power isn't meaningfully shifted regardless of who controls it.

This is so grandiosely incorrect. Ukraine is a powerhouse of radioactive extract, steel production; top 10 in so many things it is not even funny, in terms of available resources, industrial production, you name it.

 

>3) The war in Ukraine is rapidly shifting opinions in Finland and Sweden about NATO membership...and unlike Ukraine, they are wealthy, NATO-integrated, strategically relevant allies and partners. A quick resolution might end that momentum, doubly so because if NATO comes to non-NATO members' rescue, then why bother contributing the necessary amount of GDP to defense and following all the other rules?

NATO would of course love to have Finland & Sweden, but to think they would not love to have a country that the RF wants so desperately, is foolish. It hasn't happened yet due to Putin's little post-USSR land conquest for over a decade now, nukes, all that. This is a real chance for NATO however and they obviously want to capitalize.

&#x200B;

>4) While NATO loses very little by letting Ukraine fall, letting Ukrainians grind down Russia into military irrelevance is very much in NATO's interest; and the cost in weapons (or ""lethal aid"" as we call it) to do that is miniscule compared to the payoff. This is especially relevant for the the US, as a Russia that's weakened financially by heavy sanctions and militarily by intense resistance is a Russia the US has to spend less resources defending Europe from, allowing a more complete pivot Eastward.

This is completely right imo

>5) Finally, though it almost certainly would not mean nuclear annihilation, it does elevate the risk of that some, but much more significantly there is the potential for direct military action to escalate into a much wider, costly conflict. If prosecuted, this wider conflict would largely be a wasted effort, because it wouldn't accomplish any strategic goals that point 4 is already going to wrap up neatly at considerably less cost to manpower, materiel, and exposure of modern technologies and tactics to observers.

I mean, of course direct intervention leads to wider conflict. All of NATO getting involved would be massive, truly WW3 as far as the West is concerned. There's really no telling if a side would just say fuck it and launch nukes, but that would most likely not be the West, that's for sure.

&#x200B;

>This is some fucking cruel realpolitik at hand, and it ignores the tremendous amount of suffering and the growing humanitarian crisis caused by the indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Ukrainian civilians. It ignores the genuine right of the Ukrainian people to live their lives free of outside interference as the please, electing the people they choose to lead htem.  And I genuinely think that a number of elected officials in office are hiding behind nuclear hysteria as a way of getting out of having to sincerely address the above points, while still coming across as compassionate.  There are enough historical precedents of non-nuclear conflicts between nuclear powers and instances of direct hostility throughout the Cold War and all its associated proxy conflicts, that the actual threat of  ""WWIII"" alone for a defensive operation of limited scope on NATO's part is acceptably low.  It's the other factors I listed that really make the decision clear.

Unfortunately, wars do not get started for inherently moral reasons. There is some sort of greed involved, always. Be that direct capital, land gains, resources, a vast empire, etc. The US did not jump into WW2, for example, to save the day. It took direct US soil being attacked to finally get us into the fray. 

What conflicts would you be referring to? Proxy wars between nuclear powers do not count, so I'm unsure what direct conflict between 2 nuclear superpowers during the Cold War era you are talking about.

&#x200B;

>To illustrate that, were any of what's happening to Ukraine be happening to Poland, there would be a fierce, direct defensive response regardless of the nuclear risk... not because Poland is an inherently more important country than Ukraine on its own virtues, but because an unanswered Article 5 challenge is, geopolitically, the end of Western hard power hegemony, and that is absolutely worth all of the above risks and potential consequences and more.

I'm confused, there is absolutely no question about A5 enactment. If Poland gets attacked, it's a direct NATO involvement no questions asked. Do you not understand how NATO works? 

&#x200B;

>Yet they're saying, ""We're doing everything we can to help Ukraine that wouldn't cause the world to end,"" when under any real scrutiny or historical analysis of hostile encounters between nuclear powers or incidents during the Cold War, that reasoning doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

That is of course a grandiose statement, but it is 100% true this is all the West can do without expecting direct justified military reaction from Russia.

The west will absolutely let a small developing nation be wiped out to avoid a *potential* nuclear war. Not a definite one, just a potential one. The risk of that war escalating to that point is just too high in their eyes.

2. NATO isn't interfering because they're afraid, and they'll take advantage of the situation, but they wouldn't really do anything even if it came down to it.

There were, of course, failsafes. These bombs, both despite and because of their destructive capacities, were designed for this very eventuality: Built into each were four safety mechanisms meant to prevent accidental detonation. The bombs were also attached to parachutes.

While one bomb's failsafes worked as they were supposed to, the other's -- the Faro bomb -- didn't. On that bomb, as its trigger mechanisms engaged, one switch failed. Then another. Then another. The only switch that ended up working, according to Jones's report, was the final of the four. One tiny little switch standing between what we know and what could have been.

Had the device detonated, lethal fallout could have been deposited over Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia -- and could have extended as far north as New York City.

It must re-supply all 4 fronts if not now, soon.  The southestern front resupply is easiest since it is shortest and comes from Crimea; that is one of the reasons it is most successful (the other is that since Kiev is the capitol, Ukraine is using more forces to protect Kiev).

This is why the battle for the airfields is so important; near Kiev the Russian strategy assumed they could take 2-3 airports there immediately, have air supremacy and resupply the northern assault easily and Kiev would fall in a day or two.  That apparent assumption was wrong (there are reports that the convoy contains both supplies and troops to ""police"" Kiev, although those reports could be wrong, like everything I post).  But I think it is clear Russia will need to resupply the northern assault fairly soon; the fact that the ""40 km convoy"" is bogged down is a good sign.

The question is whether there is a point where Putin decides it is not worth it and decides to cut a deal.

That would, of course, be a pretty big win for Ukraine.

Still better than the worst-case scenario, not quite the best-case scenario. Or, of course, there is the possibility that Russia wins.

So we do what we can. 

We pressure companies to pull out of Russia. We tell national sports team not to play them, and tell FIFA and IOC enough is enough. 

And sometimes that's not enough either. 

So we look for other ways we can feel like we're helping, and we say ""we won't let cats from Russia participate in cat competitions"" and pressure our politicians to investigate Russian money in our countries.

The Pandora’s box that atomic weapons unleashed is an especially difficult one. Our military vastly overpowers Russia’s, but unless we want to sacrifice a few million people at a minimum, we can’t use it in a direct way.

Instead, the US, led by European nations, is sending billions in aid, weapons, and intelligence to Ukraine. This avoids a direct conflict, saves millions or BILLIONS of lives, and is still likely to defeat Russia, in part by depleting their economy and making it more likely to implode itself.

Finally, the economic sanctions are massive and Putin was ill prepared for this.  His ability to wage any effective campaign is rapidly dropping.  And while he could try nukes, wind patters of ukraine would bring the radiation to Moscow.

- The Nero Decree was an order given by Hitler to destroy critical infrastructure in Germany to avoid it being used by allied forces. The order was ignored by Albert Speer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Decree
- In 1983, a soviet nuclear early warning radar reported the launch of several missiles from America. Stanislav Petrov suspected these to be false alarms. He decided to wait for corroborating evidence rather than passing it up the chain of command. The evidence never arrived, but ultimately he was proven right when an investigation later showed that a malfunction had occurred. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident

Guess my ultimate question is, how can he afford to pay mercenaries? Let’s say Ukraine does fall. It’ll cost a fortune to maintain a presence there. There will certainly be a lot of underground resistance. 

Let’s say there isn’t any resistance. Completing the annexing of Ukraine will undoubtedly lead to much heavier sanctions on Russia. This will tank their already paltry economy further. 

Let’s say that they can weather the sanctions and there is no resistance. Now Russia has to pay to fix all the damage they just cause. Otherwise, there will be definite resistance and anger from the remaining Ukrainians. How much will it cost to make Ukraine into a somewhat stable province again? How does Russia pay for that?

 >The Russian Imperial Movement (RIM; Russian: Русское Имперское Движениe, romanized: Russkoe imperskoe dvizhenie, RID) is a Russian ultranationalist, white supremacist, far-right paramilitary organization based in Saint Petersburg. As of 2015, its leader is Stanislav Vorobyev. It has been designated as a terrorist group by the United States and Canada. RIM is part of a broader cluster of extreme-right ""political Orthodoxy"" groups in Russia that promote monarchy (specifically, by idolizing Russia's tsarist past), and draw inspiration from the violent, antisemitic Black Hundreds of early 20th century Russia.

 >Russian National Unity (RNU) or All-Russian civic patriotic movement ""Russian National Unity"" (Russian: Всероссийское общественное патриотическое движение ""Русское национальное единство""), is a neo-Nazi political party and paramilitary organization based in Russia and formerly operating in states with Russian-speaking populations. It was founded by the ultra-nationalist Alexander Barkashov. The movement advocates the expulsion of non-Russians and an increased role for traditional Russian institutions such as the Russian Orthodox Church.

 >The NASA X-43 was an experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft with multiple planned scale variations meant to test various aspects of hypersonic flight. It was part of the X-plane series and specifically of NASA's Hyper-X program. It set several airspeed records for jet aircraft. The X-43 is the fastest jet-powered aircraft on record at approximately Mach 9.

Long term, even if he is able to cause a regime change in ukraine or force a surrender by the military, it seems like it would be hard for the Russians to occupy Ukraine indefinitely. However, Putin is unlikely to be satisfied with an outcome that looks like a complete defeat/retreat at the hands of the Ukrainian military alone. It would show Russian military and governmental incompetence. 

It seems relatively clear from Ukrainian resistance that the Russian military would be outmatched against NATO. If NATO entered the fighting, Russia’s only opportunity for victory would be through nuclear escalation, however, that would end life on earth.

Because Russia’s victory scenarios currently appear to be, at best, pyrrhic maybe NATO establishing a no fly zone would give Putin an “out”; he would tell his leadership and population that the Russian military was set to win an important victory against the nazis but the fascist supporting west intervened militarily and also imposed significant sanctions; in light of this, he decided that although it would be best for Russia to save the Ukrainians from their nazi overlords, he couldn’t continue to risk Russian soldiers lives in the process. He is now going to pull out forces and continue to strengthen ties with India, China, South America, etc.

You *really* think he's going to volunteer to vaporize himself because he can't fly aircraft in Ukraine anymore?

The man is, personally, an absolute coward.

 >The trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.

1. In the US at least, public opinion is really weird regarding direct military involvement.     Polling seems to indicate that boots-on-ground involvement is coming around in polling from the 80-90% against that it was when war broke out, but is still in the mild negatives, but one recent poll cites broad 75%\~ support for a No Fly Zone.   I'm not sure the latter poll is as indicative as the first, as I'm not certain a NFZ could be prosecuted without it eventually turning into a broader war, which would drag public perception into the negatives as it sets in.   I don't really think it's a fair poll, because I'm not convinced that the average poller would understand all of the ramifications behind a NFZ.

&#x200B;

2)  In terms of available resources, Ukraine is indeed an incredibly resource-rich country...but those are resources that Western powers have had no issues sourcing elsewhere, or even internally.  Much of what you cite is incredibly useful for making Ukraine itself a richer and more developed country, but there is very little there that's absolutely essential for Western industry to function, barring say, neon extraction.   Illustrating that, sanctions we imposed upon Russia have had a more meaningful impact on our economy by something of an order of magnitude compared to literally all trade in Ukraine ceasing.   Ukraine could, one day, be a powerful and valuable ally to NATO, but it is in no way a hill worth dying on for the West, and it never was.  It's no Taiwan, with their TSMC.

&#x200B;

3)  I understand exactly how NATO works, which is my point.  NATO has used its monolithic nature as a defensive pact as an effective tool for hard and soft power historically, but all of that power, which is itself one of the cornerstones of global Western hegemony, is based on the inviolability of Article 5.   All of that geopolitical leverage goes away if they let Article 5 be compromised, which means defending one of its members from an attack *regardless of how small or strategically irrelevant that member is.*  I suppose one of the Balkan countries would be a bit better of an example than Poland, now that I think about it.  But the point is, the collective leverage of NATO as a power bloc and the diplomatic and economic cooperation it brings with it is something that western governments **absolutely would** escalate a conflict up to and including nuclear war to defend.  And that goes *even if* the actual, strategic difference between Estonia (or Poland in my first example) and Ukraine is irrelevant beyond that single piece of diplomatic paper and what it represents.

&#x200B;

4)  The conflicts I'm referencing are the sporadic wars that have occurred between India and Pakistan, as well as the ongoing conflicts between India and China.   On occasion those have boiled over into actual shooting wars interspersed with constant border tensions, land grabs, and low intensity conflict.  In spite of all three being nuclear powers, there has never been a nuclear exchange.",False,1646453254.0,t3_t6z9bo,t1_hzeq4oi,,2,2,0,2,0,0,

But people should understand that high-level geopolitics largely *is* grim cynicism, that's the whole point of my post.    We are doing quite a bit to help Ukraine, and I sincerely feel that their resistance to their plight and their innocence in it has prompted a far stronger response from the West than they otherwise might have gotten.   And I'm genuinely glad for that, and wish we could do more.

Nobody at all is laughing maniacally and hoping that they tear one another apart.

The United States explained the attack by stating that the pro-government forces had ″initiated an unprovoked attack against well-established Syrian Democratic Forces headquarters"" in the area, while Coalition service members were ""co-located with SDF partners during the attack 8 kilometers (5 mi) east of the agreed-upon Euphrates River de-confliction line"".

If Putin can simply claim anything he wants to justify any level of aggression, and NATO can't respond from fear of escalation, then we've already lost. Putin just gets to do anything he wants unchecked.

The way you deal with an irrational person is to draw a line in the sand at a reasonable place, and hold your ground, not crossing it yourself. In this instance, a NATO defensive presence would have a very clear rule of engagement. If they are fired on, they respond very strongly, but do not continue past that. It doesn't escalate because we don't escalate it. Granted, this tactic would not push Russia out of Ukraine, and it's only purpose would to be prevent a repeat of Chechnya. 

One reason this might work is that Russia has already played a lot of their cards now. They've already escalated things pretty hard from a traditional standpoint. What would they respond with? Another reason is NATOs apparent technological advances. We could likely respond ""In kind"" much more successfully than they could. Putin has already lost the war of public opinion home and abroad, so successfully ratcheting up things could be difficult to find internal support as long as we NATO holds the non offensive stance. 

The hard part about this method would be the NATO troops would have a shit job. The other risk is that Russia develops a new type of asymmetric warfare; some kind of a hit and run. In theory a NATO exit strategy could be straight forward; to modernize Ukraine's military enough to kick out Russia. NATO would just be buying them time.",False,1646454256.0,t3_t6z9bo,t1_hzembh6,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

 >The Nero Decree (German: Nerobefehl) was issued by Adolf Hitler on March 19, 1945 ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent its use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany. It was officially titled Decree Concerning Demolitions in the Reich Territory (Befehl betreffend Zerstörungsmaßnahmen im Reichsgebiet) and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree, after the Roman Emperor Nero, who, according to an apocryphal story, engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. The decree was deliberately disobeyed by Albert Speer.
 
**[1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident)** 
 
 >On 26 September 1983, the nuclear early-warning radar of the Soviet Union reported the launch of one intercontinental ballistic missile with four more missiles behind it, from bases in the United States. These missile attack warnings were suspected to be false alarms by Stanislav Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces on duty at the command center of the early-warning system. He decided to wait for corroborating evidence—of which none arrived—rather than immediately relaying the warning up the chain-of-command.

Once you realize it was a 3 or 4 way conflict due to a splintered opposition, and avoid the false premise that the opposition to Assad was either socialist, democratic, or evil Islamist, the civil war makes more sense. 

Assad regime faced a rebellion. Russia's intervention was key in propping up this Assad regime. The rebellion splintered. The Islamists largely lost, but Turkey holds an enclave for the 'moderates' in the northwest. The USA's largely secular Kurdish allies fought ISIS and still control a third of the nation's northeast. 

PS - The splintered opposition is not just a headache for outsiders. It was a large reason why the rebellion failed against Assad. Ukraine's unity is a key force multiplier against Moscow.",1646666328.0,1646457024.0,t3_t6z9bo,t1_hzexqze,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Before the war, the debate between the pro- and anti-war people wasn’t over whether Saddam had WMDs, it was over how imminent the threat was, whether Iraqis would welcome regime change, and the possibility of mass civilian casualties.

The anti-war side was pushing the notion that Bush et al were motivated by lust for oil. It wasn’t until the war had been going on a while and no WMDs were found that the notion that Bush et al purposefully lied to lead us to war starting getting traction.

But neither criticism, either the oil one or the lie one, really fit the facts. The better antiwar arguments (that unprovoked invasions are a terrible idea, that turning Iraq into a liberal democracy was *not* going to happen, that it would be too economically devastating and that too many innocent people would suffer, etc.) didn’t really make a good slogan (“no blood for oil”, “Bush lied, people died”) or fit a partisan political agenda so they weren’t pushed as loudly.

It was a massive intelligence failure, naïveté about how successful occupation would be, and ignoring how the ensuing insurgency would just breed more terrorism that led us into that stupid war, and Bush is responsible.

But the “Bush lied to lead us to war” never made sense. Unless you think Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and even Bernie Sanders were in on the lie too:

 >The Monroe Doctrine was a United States foreign policy position that opposed European colonialism in the Western Hemisphere. It held that any intervention in the political affairs of the Americas by foreign powers was a potentially hostile act against the U.S. The doctrine was central to U.S. foreign policy for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. President James Monroe first articulated the doctrine on December 2, 1823, during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress (though it would not be named after him until 1850). At the time, nearly all Spanish colonies in the Americas had either achieved or were close to independence.

There is historical precedence for this placation approach and it didn't end well.  In fact by leaving things so late things got much worse.

What message is the west sending the leaders of other countries right now?  ""Just get nukes and you can operate with impunity"".  Sanctions are all fine and dandy against Russia.  The west doesn't OVERLY rely on Russia.  But what about China?  You can't sanction China without destroying your own economy.  

I always see this bigger picture type of argument but rarely do the people making actually have the true bigger picture in mind.  What I see a lot if fear being expressed by people too young to have ever seen a major east vs west conflict.  It has happened before and no one nuked anyone.  

Putin has correctly realized that the demographic shift in the population of the west has made us soft.  Too many people are no alive who were taught not to fight back against a bully but to tell a teacher or whatever.  

War fucking sucks.   No one wants it.  But throughout the entirety of history when you have a man like Putin you HAVE to deal with them.  Sanctions is some neo bullshit.  Sure they hurt in the long run but rarely ever hurt the people they are supposed to.  NK has endured decades of punishing sanctions as has Cuba.  In both cases it is the citizens that suffer while the political elite carry on.  

All our sanctions accomplished in North Korea was them building nukes... or did we all forget that?  Building nukes and statving people to death.  You think Russia is going to be different.  Iran is the same thing.  Cuba the same.  All still have the same basic regimes in place while the people suffer.

Moreover he would be “justified” in claiming that NATO’s aggression on Russia’s border is a direct attack on Russia’s safety.

The thing to remember though, is that Putin threatens nuclear war if someone burns his toast...

He fled to the Ural mountains at the start of this, even though there was exactly no threat to Moscow...

I confidently believe the West has the ability to life rush off in that before an equally large countermeasure takes place.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%B9\_Lai\_massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%E1%BB%B9_Lai_massacre)

  
2 batallions of the U.S. military gunned down and straight up murdered 500 unarmed civilians from a village in the Vietnam war. Only ONE was held responsible (their commanding officer) - and his punishment was a total of 3 years in house arrest. The guys who obeyed orders and pulled the triggers got nothing. The three U.S. servicemen who had tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned, and even denounced as traitors by several U.S. Congressmen

I honestly believe he has a physical ailment of some sort that has impacted his emotional and mental state.  That’s just a hunch, but at the very least he is disappointed in the last several decades of his country’s history and has realized he has a lot of influence in his waning years.

I’m also certainly not advocating for a no-fly zone.  I have children, family, friends, coworkers, and random internet debate opponents whom I truly want to live long, happy lives.

If it were just me and the Pootster sitting at the nuclear card table with nobody else in harms way, I think I’d push all in, but that’s not the situation.

I simply cannot stand the situation at hand both in Ukraine and all of the other places around the world where people are caught in the meat grinder with no way out.  Probably just like you, and so many other people helplessly watching the news, feeling that pit in their stomach tighten at every new scene that plays out.

So these people get on and want the world to do something.  They talk about no-fly zones, assassinations, first launches and all manner of *probably not the best ideas*.  But instead of simple empathy and an attempt at helping people understand a little better, a lot of jackasses just come in and make asinine, dismissive comments and frankly, that’s how conflict starts in the first place.

- not all Volunteers know how to speak English. There’s gonna be communication problems even without each squad. 
- what’s the command structure? Who are leaders?
- Not all volunteers are from NATO countries. They have different battle language, different army terms for maneuvers and tactics. 
- are there enough radios for each unit to communicate? Are there enough rifles? Weapons? Protective gear? 
- Hell the civilian population already don’t have enough food and water and even electricity. How does anyone propose to feed the volunteer army? Provide shelter, tents, water, generators? The basic supplies that feed an army? 
- are there transport to transport these troops to the frontline? Or are they expected to March hundreds of Kilometres to the frontline without air cover? They will be killed and slaughtered by Russian airforce. 
- are there enough air defense missile systems to defend these volunteers from Russian airforce? 
- can they learn to work together well? To forge an huge army, most nations take years to master that technique. Even with experienced leaders it will still take time to train and to coordinate the huge volunteer army.

Generally speaking, it's a poor strategic decision to piss off nations whose currency you use as your reserve. Russia made that choice, they did not anticipate what we would do to them. That was a poor risk assessment.",False,1646458107.0,t3_t6z9bo,t1_hzf25bs,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

Lithuania/Estonia are technically closer to Moscow, and they definitely are to St Petersberg. If we wanted to put nukes we would do that there.

This is fear mongering and bullshit to justify a stupid war.

Plus to reiterate a point repeatedly made by others. Putin said he was invading to denazify Ukraine.

So let's ask the Jewish President if he's a nazi.

Hint: I suspect the answer will be no.

So again, you are spreading Russian propaganda on purpose. Your points and grandstanding is bullshit.

The Ukrainians however have had choices every step of the way. Not happy or good ones, but they're choices. Some chose to leave and find asylum. Some chose to stay and defend. Some didn't get the choice to leave, but they did choose to take up arms and defend themselves and their country. I'm sure some chose to give up and paid for that choice with their life.
