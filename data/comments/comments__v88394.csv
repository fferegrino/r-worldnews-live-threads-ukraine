Western-supplied artillery systems are already making a difference on the ground for Ukraine, the governor of the Mykolaiv region, Vitaliy Kim, said today.

Mr Kim, whose region is partially occupied by Russia, told Reuters that Ukrainian forces had ""some success"" in recent weeks in a counterattack in the neighbouring Kherson region.

Asked when Western weapons would start to make a difference on the ground, he said: ""It is already happening and we will have (more) success.""

""We are talking about artillery,"" he said.

 ""It is already working in our region.""

Last week, the UK pledged to send medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine after the US and Germany said they would equip the nation in its war.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said Britain would send M270 launchers, which can fire precision-guided rockets up to 50 miles.

He also said Ukrainian troops would be trained in the UK to use the equipment. 

It came as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his country would send modern anti-aircraft missiles and radar systems to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia’s occupation and blockade of Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea will cause a “food genocide worldwide.”

“We have 20 billion worth of grains that have been blocked in Ukrainian ports,” Zelenskyy said via video conference at the Yale CEO summit.

“We are going to have an additional 50 billion tons of grains and foodstuffs in Ukraine, which are going to be stranded in Ukraine because of the occupation and the blockage,” he added.

For weeks, Russian forces have blocked roughly a dozen Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov.

Abandoning Ukraine ""would be morally repugnant"" and we must continue to support the country ""for as long as it takes"" amid its war with Russia, Boris Johnson said today in a speech on the cost of living crisis in Blackpool.

In his speech, Mr Johnson said there was no quick fix to the instability prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine but that the economic consequences of the war would abate over time.

He said: ""Putin has made a colossal strategic error, he has fundamentally misunderstood the psychology of his opponents and what Ukraine really is.

""He will never succeed in subduing Ukraine and the sooner he comes to that understanding the better.

""Nor should he be allowed the partial success of swallowing some of the country as he has done before and declaring a ceasefire.

""He would be able to continue to twist the knife in the wound and the crocodile would simply come back for more and he would be able to claim his aggression and his violence had paid off.""

The prime minister went on to say that now is not the time to stop supporting Ukraine and even though prices for gas, oil, grain and fertilisers have risen, the West cannot force Kyiv to accept peace terms dictated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

""Over time the inflationary effects will start to diminish,"" he added.

Now, Ukrainian commander Petro Kuzyk has described how his troops are fighting ""for every house and every street"" in the region.

Mr Kuzyk, who is commander of the Svoboda (Freedom) national guard battalion, said street fighting in the small industrial city was at times raging under heavy Russian artillery barrages that endangered troops on both sides.

""We fight for every house and every street,"" he told national television.

""Yesterday was successful for us. We went on a counterattack and in some areas we managed to push them back by one or two blocks. In others we pushed them back literally by one or two houses.""

Mr Kuzyk went on to say that Russian forces were now ""simply covering both their own troops and our units with artillery fire"".

It really does feel worse when you know that during those explosions you hear some people get injured or killed.

Sberbank has been unable to conduct transactions in yuan since the beginning of the week due to a decision by its Chinese counterparty. The bank has forwarded a corresponding message to its customers.
Chinese banks and companies fear secondary sanctions and exclusion from the European and US banking systems.

Russian authorities believed they were using the yuan to avoid sanctions. The Russian central bank has therefore placed a significant portion of its reserves in the Chinese currency.

Indian Potash Limited (IPL) was also affected by the problem of inability to exchange. It opened an account with Sberbank and deposited Rs 1.7 billion in it to raise rubles to buy potash fertilisers. As the transaction did not take place, the company approached Sberbank with written enquiries and information that it would seek refund of the money. Even after two days, the bank did not respond.

Reuters, citing three anonymous government officials in India, writes that the country will be cautious about introducing a mechanism for settlement in rubles and rupees between countries. One of the officials said New Delhi might even hold off on setting up such a mechanism until there were signs of de-escalation on Ukrainian territory.

We've got a bit more from the court in Donetsk where two British men and a Moroccan have just been sentenced to the death penalty. They are foreign fighters with the Ukrainian military but they were accused of being mercenaries.  
  
The chair of the panel of judges who gave the death penalty has described sentence as just.  
  
Alexander Nikulin, said the court had been guided by ""not only the prescribed norms and riles, but the main, inviolable principle of justice,"" according to the Interfax news agency.  
  
Interfax said the three men were tried for ""mercenarism"" and activities ""aimed at seizing power and toppling the constitutional order"" of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic.  
  
Tass news agency quoted a lawyer acting on behalf of the defendants saying that all three ""wished to"" appeal against the sentence.

Former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen has told Sky News the military alliance has a duty to help Ukraine with the ""means to fight"" and ""win this war"".

He said the only language that Russian President Vladimir Putin understands is ""a language of strength, force and unity"".

""That's why we should continue to put maximum pressure on Russia through delivery of all the weapons and cutting off all financing of Russia,"" he said.

""I think the European Union should cut off all financing of Putin's war machine.""

He said it was a good first step for the EU to ban around 75% of Russian oil imports, but it should be followed by an embargo on gas too.

""That would bring Putin's war machine to its knees,"" he said.

He continued: ""I think history has taught us that appeasement with dictators does not lead to peace. On the contrary, it leads to war and conflict.

""I've noted that someone [we think he is talking about French President Emmanuel Macron here] has proposed that it would be dangerous to humiliate Putin.

""Setting the precedent that an aggressor can achieve territorial gains through a peace deal after pursuing an unjustified war - that will only encourage other dictators as well. It would send a very dangerous signal.""

He warned the biggest risk right now is a prolonged conflict, because ""Putin and Russia are experts in prolonged, simmering, frozen conflict"".

""I think Putin's goal might be to continue to destabilise and weaken Ukraine through a prolonged conflict,"" he said.

""I think this is currently the biggest risk and that's why we have to deliver all the weapons that Ukraine needs.""

From CNN's Mick Krever

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization over the impact its war in Ukraine has had on global food insecurity.

The call is likely largely symbolic. All 193 UN member nations are also members of the FAO.

“There can also be no question of Russia's continued membership in the FAO – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,” Zelensky said during a speech Thursday to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. “What has Russia to do there if it is working for starvation of at least four hundred million and at most more than a billion people?”

Polish President Andrzej Duda has criticised the leaders of France and Germany for having phone calls with Vladimir Putin, saying it was the equivalent of conducting talks with Adolf Hitler during the Second World War, Germany's Bild newspaper reports.

Over the course of the war in Ukraine, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron have held one-on-one phone calls with Mr Putin in an effort to encourage negotiations between the two sides.

However, Mr Duda has now said such discussions only legitimised an illegal war in Ukraine.

He told the Bild: ""Did anyone speak like this with Adolf Hitler during World War Two?"" 

""Did anyone say that Adolf Hitler must save face? That we should proceed in such a way that it is not humiliating for Adolf Hitler? I have not heard such voices.""

Earlier this month, Ukraine's foreign minister criticised Mr Macron after the French leader said Russia must not be ""humiliated"" over the invasion of its neighbour.

In an interview with a regional newspaper, Mr Macron said: ""We must not humiliate Russia so that the day when the fighting stops we can build an exit ramp through diplomatic means.""

He added that he was ""convinced that it is France's role to be a mediating power"".

From CNN’s Mariya Knight

A Ukrainian official on Wednesday accused Russia of stealing about 600,000 tons of grain from Ukraine that he claimed was later transported to the Middle East.

In a statement, Denys Marchuk, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Agrarian Council Public Union claimed the grain was stolen from occupied regions in the south of the country.

He claimed the grain was transported to the port of Sevastopol in the Russian-occupied territory of Crimea before onward shipment to the Middle East.

Criminal cases have been opened “to demand through the international courts of law that Russia compensates those who has been affected by these actions,” Marchuk said.
Marchuk called Russia’s actions “a well-planned operation by the occupiers.”

Russia has not yet responded to Marchuk’s accusation. 

Some context: CNN has previously reported that convoys of trucks have been seen carrying grain from farms and silos in southern Ukraine into Crimea. Ukrainian authorities estimated in May that Russian forces in occupied areas had seized more than 400,000 tons of grain.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed humanitarian and military support during a call Thursday, according to a statement from the French government, as troops continue to battle for a key eastern city.

Local Ukrainian officials say the city of Severodonetsk is now mostly controlled by Russian forces. Earlier in separate remarks, Zelensky said the region ""remains the epicenter of the confrontation in Donbas.""

According to the statement describing the nature of the call between Zelensky and Macron, the French president said his country ""will remain mobilized to meet Ukraine's needs, including heavy weapons.""

Macron also asked Zelensky about his needs ""in terms of military equipment, political support, financial support and humanitarian aid.""

The statement said the two leaders agreed to stay in touch, ""especially in light of the opinion that the European Commission is going to deliver on Ukraine's application to join the European Union.""",False,1654832877.0,t3_v88394,t3_v88394,,0,8,0,8,0,0,

What makes Severodonestk special is how much the Russians want it. The ""pontoon bridge"" incident was all in support of Severodonestk. This battle has been going on for more than a month, and Russia continues to increase the number of troops in that area, concentrating their firepower and focusing their artillery more-and-more.

Russia really wants that city. A month ago, I was inclined to believe that Ukraine should just ""kinda give it to them"" (perform rear-guard action, retreat slowly, fight another day). But, Ukraine's strategy seems to fight back fiercely and bleed the Russians in a higher-risk, bloodier battle.

There's certainly advantages to Ukraine's approach here. Maybe they've done the calculus and realize that the only way the war ends is if enough Russian soldiers die. (Kill enough soldiers, and Russia simply will become unable to perform offensive operations). So in this sense, it doesn't matter if Ukraine fights ""here"" in Severodontesk, or ""later"" somewhere else. The sooner the Russians die, the sooner everything ends.

These are people who see the world as a bipolar struggle between an oppressed team good guy and a conspiracy of Ultimate Evil. This is fairly common in political history, with famous examples including Marxism, Christian Nationalism, Islamic Jihadi movements, many mainstream Nationalist groups and so forth.  

People who ascribe to this kind of political philosophy tend to ascribe to the obvious consequential conspiracy theory. If the politics and at least recent history of the world is really all about the fight of team good guys (whoever that is) against the Ultimate Evil (be it Capitalism, Atheism, non-WASPs, non-Muslims or whoever), then it follows that anyone who is working against the Ultimate Evil is working for team good guys and should be supported. By the same token, anyone who is friendly with the Ultimate Evil must likewise be evil.

There is a strong streak of this among some American radical progressives and MAGA conservatives, and certainly their anti-moderate views make them easy targets for this kind of conspiracy theory. In the eyes of the radical leftist, anyone who opposes America's evil oppressive capitalist rulers are on ""their"" side. They have difficulty imagining a multi-polar world where everyone has their own personal concerns and battles. It's a form of extreme political narcissism that makes everything in the world all about *their* problems and preferences.

Right now they are relying on the original troops they sent into Ukraine, trying to cajole veterans into re-enlisting, what the mercenary Wagner group has scraped together and some forced conscription in the territories they already occupied in the Donbass. Yes a few of Russian conscripts have been found fighting in Ukraine but they are a very small part of the Russian forces there.

Meanwhile Ukraine has tens of thousands or maybe even more soldiers that will be finishing their training in the next few months. Even if Russia started drafting more tomorrow if they want to do any training at all they won't be ready to fight until much later than those Ukrainian troops are ready to fight. Plus Russia is already scrapping the bottom of the barrel for equipment when they're giving some troops steel helmets and mosin nagant bolt action rifles. And dragging out ancient T-62 tanks from the 1960's.

Yes Russia could fully mobilize more troops than Ukraine, get industry to at least make them some basic modern kit, give them some decent training and just overwhelm Ukraine with sheer numbers but they haven't done that yet. And the only reason they wouldn't have already done it is because they think it will cause too much dissent in the Russian population. I think Putin has decided mass mobilization simply won't fly even with his propaganda machine in full swing.

So if they're not going to fully mobilize Russia chances in this war go way down, if they haven't done it yet I don't feel they plan on doing it in the future so that means trying to keep trying with insufficient forces they are struggling to take the rest of Donbass with. Meanwhile Ukraine's combat power looks to be increasing as Russia's stagnates, even if they could use more heavy equipment from donors.

ace7c168aefa9c150fbbab8e3ddeb9f6,v88394,ibqxkp5,"Yes.  Composite is better than steel/iron which is better than rock/concrete which is better than loam or wood which is better than water.  Those are approximately even steps in a ball park sort of way.  Diving into water does offer some protection from rifle bullets.  Spaced armor is a thing so cobbles might even be slightly better than concrete slabs though probably not reinforced concrete.  Soldiers may laugh at the tanks but ask about their preference for sniper positions in buildings with brick vs buildings with aluminum siding.

More armor has a mixed effect. The likelihood of sinking into the mud increases with weight.  Modern tanks can be used as fun sporty all terrain vehicles.  Before you could fly over a half meter obstacle at 40 kph, bounce a few times and keep cruising.  With a big pile of rock bags the same action snaps something in the suspension system or loses a tread.  Engine performance is measured in horsepower(or kilowatt) per ton.  More tons means lower performance.  

It looks silly.  It is also cheap.  They can dump the rock bags anytime.  The stone bags can be used by infantry to make a machine gun nests.  They might be in a unit with orders to have the infantry march with the tanks.  They may temporarily not need much engine performance and the ground may be dry.  

Russians will probably forget about the stone and drive the vehicle into a river.  Or they will break the suspension so that they can abandon the tank.  All the scenarios increase their personal survival chances.  Even a slight decrease in the odds of shell detonating the autoloader increases the crew's life expectancy.",False,1654791868.0,t3_v88394,t1_ibqrf0d,,2,6,0,6,0,0,

 >The Genocide of the Ingrian Finns is a series of events triggered by the Russian Revolution in the 20th century, in which the Soviet Union deported, imprisoned and killed Ingrians and destroyed their culture. In the process, Ingria, in the historical sense of the word, ceased to exist. Before the persecution there were 140,000 to 160,000 Ingrians in Russia and today approximately 19,000 (after several thousands repatriated since 1990). From 1935 onwards, the genocide manifested itself in deportations of entire Ingrian villages, mass arrests and executions, especially in 1937 and 1938 associated with the Great Purge.

Only Republicans voted against the $40-billion aid bill that allowed Biden to send in HIMARS.

Its Republicans who are against sending bigger and better aid packages, not Biden. Why aren't you chastising Rand Paul?

Talk about these people, not Biden: 

* Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri
* Sen. Mike Lee of Utah
* Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana
* Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho
* Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee
* Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee
* Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas
* Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas
* Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming
* Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky
* Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama

These are the people who blocked the $40-Billion aid package and slowed it down from reaching Ukrainian hands.

Remember, Zelensky did two things that Russia used as the reason for it's military operations. They refused to solve the problem of Donbas and they said they were going to join NATO. And the issue gets more complicated in Donbas when you realize that the West regarded the Ukranian government as being corrupt in 2014. So a corrupt group of anti-Russians were fighting ethnic Russians in Eastern Ukraine. Big fucking deal right?

Now it's clear there's going to be a grinding war and even escalation of the conflict due to the West financing Zelensky and not telling the little fuck to admit he lost and accept Russia's peace terms

Now world famine is happening. Lovely. I say we all cut off our cocks for Ukraine. Slava Ukraine or whatever people say. Let's keep encouraging Zelensky not to accept Russia's terms in peace talks, the US and NATO will just keep taking money from the citizens and giving it to Ukraine because that's cool?

I kind of feel that. Gas up, rent up, everything up. What about government aid redistributed to American's and not to a demon elf who wants to rule over ethnic Russians in Donbas?

The guy also was saying cities couldn't surrender, essentially condemning the civilians to die so that he can prance around pretending to be some great defender of Ukraine

My main point, and I'm not sure if you got this, is that this is a proxy war and Ukraine is a welfare state. We are fighting the war. We built their economy, funded it, and have been doing it since 2014. So I don't think that Zelensky has the right to indepenent decision as long as we pay his bills.

They would think, ""what the fuck this is weird. I didn't agree to this. I think I would prefer that money and maybe let the ethnic Russians join Russia"".

War is not in our best interests. It's in nobody's best interest. Zelensky is hiding Ukranian causalty figures and the whole thing is a shit show.

Quite frankly your mistake is exactly this assumption. You see one type of behaviour and you immediately assume the worst. I could equally argue that those 188 Republicans afterwards voted pro-Ukraine, and that this was not an ""optics"" thing, as you suggest, and therefore there is intrinsic support. Both arguments are suppositions and lack a basis. 

Fact is that right now there are 53 Republicans in the house who have always voted against Ukraine, and that number does not necessarily represent a pro-Russia point of view. Fact is, many Republicans always will vote against whatever Biden would propose, as they have styled themselves as anti-authority lawmakers and ""America first"" lawmakers. If you recall, there was even a time when the Republicans filibustered their own bill, much of what they do is meant as performative protest and should not be immediately seen as a real policy position.

Lastly, your argument does not account for the shifting of political tides. As I said, if Trump wins the candidacy for the 2024 elections, we can expect that his pro-Russia line of thinking will be taken over. If he does not, we can expect more classical narratives to remain active. 

A few years ago the Republican party was the party of Trump, but now that is no longer so clear. His influence is palpable but no longer so absolute. He's lost a general election and candidates he has endorsed have been losing elections as well. There is a very real question as to how palatable and influential he is. Certainly, he still has a rabid fanbase, but that base has not been energized enough to carry him and his vassals through recent elections. As such, his ability to set the narrative and talking points has also been reduced.

So again - we must wait and see what will happen with the Republicans. But the statement that ""If the Republicans win both houses the support for Ukraine will end"" is factually baseless, loaded with a large amount of assumptions and does not account for the dynamics that we see playing out currently in the Republican party.",False,1654790011.0,t3_v88394,t1_ibqlwtn,,6,1,0,1,0,0,

The Paratrooper's job wasn't ""offense"", strictly speaking. The Paratrooper's job was to defend as many bridges as possible that led to the beach, preventing German tank reinforcements.

Though 24,000 paratroopers were deployed to support D-Day, the bulk of the work was done by the 150,000+ strong amphibious landings on the beaches. Paratroopers wouldn't ""push out"" offensively. They're deployed to protect an area by surprise. Whether it was back then, or today.

-------

The D-Day landings are an exact scenario where paratroopers really do excel, even in today's world. Imagine if you will, that the Russian VDV secured the Donets river before attempting the disasterous pontoon bridge attempt.
