Day 103 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Most of the day was relatively quiet, with some rare sounds of explosions, mostly coming from the oblast and not from the city itself. Sound does travel pretty far, so some of those seemingly close explosions could actually be many kilometers away, and even from outside of the city.

Air raid alert was also active for over 6 hours in the morning, but nothing much happened during it. At around 9pm there was another shelling of Kharkiv and its oblast, it was pretty loud here, and clouds of smoke were seen in the distance. And just about two hours ago, at 3am there were a couple of very loud explosions in the city, after that a fire started somewhere. People living near there reported that their window frames were blown out from those explosions; it seems another residential district was shelled.

There were some unconfirmed reports saying that Tsupivka was liberated, but there’s not much information about it, the only thing that is certain is that there’s intense fighting going on for it right now. And also Blahodatne in Kherson oblast was confirmed to be liberated, which is great, one step closer to Kherson itself. Situation in Sievierodonetsk seems very fluid, entire parts of the city change hands basically every day, and officials are saying that Russians are destroying the city with artillery now, but it still stands either way.",False,1654567482.0,t3_v5u8iw,t3_v5u8iw,,0,114,0,114,2,0,

Moscow has denounced airspace closures by three eastern European countries which prevented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov from travelling to Serbia as a “hostile action.”

Countries surrounding Serbia – Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro – closed their airspace to an official plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday.

Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, told reporters such actions could cause problems with the timetabling of high-level diplomatic meetings. But they would not prevent Moscow from maintaining contacts with friendly countries, he added

> Ukrainian forces continued to conduct limited and localized but successful counterattacks against Russian positions throughout Ukraine on June 5, including retaking large areas of Severodonetsk—the city in Luhansk Oblast the Kremlin has concentrated the majority of its forces on capturing. A Russian Telegram channel claimed that Ukrainian troops launched a counterattack north of Kharkiv City, indicating that Ukrainian forces continue to pressure Russian defensive lines near the Russian border. Ukrainian forces are likely seeking to leverage the continued Russian focus on Severodonetsk to conduct counterattacks on other axes of advance. Even as Russian forces continue to pour equipment and troops into the Severodonetsk-Lysychansk area, Ukrainian forces have conducted a successful counterattack in Severodonetsk in the last 48 hours and pushed Russian troops back to the eastern outskirts of the city and out of southern settlements. Ukrainian counteroffensive pressure will likely continue to draw the attention of Russian forces to Luhansk Oblast and therefore leave vulnerabilities in Russian defensive efforts in Kharkiv Oblast and along the Southern Axis. The ability of Ukrainian forces to successfully counterattack in Severodonetsk, the Kremlin’s current priority area of operations, further indicates the declining combat power of Russian forces in Ukraine.

Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says Moscow will respond to Western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine by pushing Ukrainian forces back, further away from Russia’s border.

“The longer the range of the systems that will be delivered, the further we will move back the Nazis from that line from which threats to Russian-speakers and the Russian Federation may come,” he told a news conference, citing Russia’s repeated description of authorities in Ukraine as neo-Nazis and nationalists – labels that Kyiv says are being used as propaganda to justify the conflict

Lavrov also described as  “unprecedented” the move by Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro to block his plane from travelling to Serbia, adding that he had yet to receive an explanation for their decision.

He said that he would instead invite his Serbian counterpart to visit him in Moscow. “The main thing is no one will be able to destroy our relations with Serbia,” Lavrov added

Quick Summary:

1. Russia has much more generals than NATO/Ukraine armies, and they lead much smaller groups of soldiers. Which means that Russian generals are usually less valuable than NATO/Ukraine ones.
2. At the same time, they are the only ones who can make routine or even tiny decisions. That is why they have to be ""on the front"". This differs from NATO/Ukraine armies' approach, where such decisions (e.g. to start artillery fire) might be made by regular officers/soldiers.

They probably hoped that by fighting on one front close to the Russian border that they could just slowly make their way to kyiv.  They didn't realize their army is incapable of doing anything beyond flattening a city.

You have to keep in mind most of the forces on the ground are militia, not professional, which means they are local people fighting their own local wars for their own local regions.  They're under the command, if you can even use that word, of the oblast, not Kyiv.  And supplementing these militia are the professional units.  

But Ukraine did not send many professional units to Zaporizhzhia.  They send several of the foreign volunteer brigades and maybe one, one and a half native brigades.  By and large this is not their best people, and only the native brigade, which was reformed from Kyiv units, can be said to be experienced.    

The way I can see it happening is since the Zaporizhzhia front is not a continuous one, just built around several strongholds with long stretches in between that are *occasionally* patroled, it's easy to slip through and conduct operations.  

But I doubt very much these operations are designed to liberate or occupy towns.

That is probably now to capture Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, and maintain the land route to Crimea (and maintaining control of the water source).

After that, he can wait for Zelenskyy to lose some popularity and wait for the West's provision of equipment to dry up a bit - all while firming up Russian positions. The war could then stall and fall into the same state the Donbass was in between 2015-2020. 

Putin then dies of cancer having ""achieved"" some goals.

On a base level, it's a simple way to estimate how well an army is or is not doing, but that doesn't always align with the goals of both sides - especially in this case, the Ukrainian forces.

The Ukrainians are focused on attriting the Russian ground troops on a constant basis (you can't hold ground with artillery and aircraft, after all) and degrading or forcing the Russians to waste critical logistical and supporting elements, while they buy time to allow reinforcements and new weapons to reach the front to bolster their position.    Territorially, the Ukrainians are more focused on possessing critical chokepoints and positions they can fight back with an overwhelming advantage.

The first gambit is that Russia will hit a stable floor economically before the west will.  Even if that floor is much, much lower and produces massive economic strife for Russia, the bet is that the west will not tolerate burning off any significant portion of GDP here.  In 2008, the housing crash brought the west to its knees on a mere 3% contraction in GDP (along with some other major factors).  So if rising energy costs lead to inflation and recession in the west, Putin believes that the public will not tolerate this, and that it may actually help friendly far-right politicians win in these places.  
  
The second part of this is likely that Putin does not believe it will be logistically possible for the west to build out new, strategically sound energy infrastructure in time to avert an energy-driven recession.  Things are ramping up now, and in the long term people will likely point to this as a catalyst which drove a renewable energy renaissance, but this will take years to fully realize even in the most optimistic scenarios.  
  
The combination of these two things does seemingly give Putin some economic leverage.

No, yes, sort of.

Russia's offensive capability is slowly diminishing, but will never reach 0.

They will be difficult to displace from territory they have taken, due to favorable air situation (for them), and insufficient artillery on the Ukrainian side.

They can keep committing resources for years if they decide it is in their strategic interest.  Or rather, the *leadership's* strategic interest.

Yesterday, Zelenskyy visited Lysychansk.

That means the Russian offensive has stalled. Such an important person would not visit Lysychansk unless the Ukrainians were confident in his security.

So the timeframe you're talking about was probably just about... yesterday. If I were to take a guess.

To the point where President Zelenskyy can safely visit the ""pocket"" of the #1 objective of the Russian offensive push.

This almost certainly marks the point where the war is shifting from Russian-offense / Ukrainian-defense, to Ukrainian-offense / Russian-defense.

Direct price controls aren’t possible without granting the government legal authority to do so, and I don’t think that would pass Congress either. Basically anything requiring Congress to act seems unlikely due to present partisan political realities; the Republicans have shown time and again they are willing to leave the economy hurting if it helps them in the midterms, and since the GOP+2 DINO’s control the Senate, that’s all we can say about it. 

Increasing our own production or drilling wouldn’t have much of an immediate effect either. Leaning on OPEC countries to increase production seems futile to me. Though I agree with you that it’s past time to cut Saudi Arabia loose (has been since at least 9/11).

Nobody knows exactly how many Ukraine has mobilized but as their training finishes up in the next few months you're going to see tens of thousands if not maybe a couple hundred thousand more Ukranian troops and those at the front line can draw on the vast array of small arms, vests, helmets, med kits, uniforms and so on that they have been given that have almost gotten lost amongst all the talk of heavy weapons. Yes Ukraine could use more tanks, armored personal carriers, howitzers, anti aircraft systems and so on but Russia is already hauling out 1960 era T-62's and equipping some conscripted troops with steel helmets and mosin nagant bolt action rifles.

So even with sanctions making it difficult for Russia to replace some of their high tech weapon systems could Russia overwhelm Ukraine by drafting even more people than they have and then force industry to make them proper basic infantry kit? Sure they *could* but the thing is they haven't fully mobilized yet. They don't have tens or hundreds of thousands of troops that have been training since the star of the war. They don't have their economy on a war time footing.

So since Russia hasn't done that it seems too many that Ukraine should shortly have an overwhelming advantage in infantry and a decent number of replacement armored vehicles like the few hundred T-72's from Eastern European countries and the hundreds of M113 armored personnel carriers from several countries. Then add in the other heavy weapon systems as well. Sure Ukraine could always use more but the optimism you're seeing some have isn't necessarily baseless, it's because Ukraine has more troops coming into the war in the next few months than Russia does, most likely way more.

Ya Russia could crush them long term with weight of numbers but they haven't shown any signs of actually doing that yet and even if they started tomorrow it would be months from now until they hit the front lines. It seems like they might be at a decided disadvantage for at least a few months, that's a huge opportunity for Ukraine and good reason to be optimistic.

Russia had about 1 million active at the start of the war but Russia also has a large Navy taking up nearly half of those numbers which isn't that involved in this war. Then a large number is also Air Force which hasn't been able to take control of Ukraine's air. Only around 280k of the 1 million was infantry.

Ukraine had around 175k active when this started, some of those are air force so it was around 125k infantry. Ukraine also had around 50k boarder patrol which operates through the military and has training to fight. Since this started in 2014 Ukraine has had 7 drafts, bringing in new and releasing those that had been there the longest. When this kicked off earlier this year Ukraine had around 400k citizens with war time military training that was either active or had previously been. Many of those signed back up to train.

Ukraine recently has stated that they have around 700k fighting. If Russia was to pull in all of their active military they would need to come up with 420k conscripts to match Ukraine's numbers.

Russia has the advantage by number of artillery but that is coming to an end. We often see that Ukraine does very well in urban fighting against Russia. Ukraine has the advantage of night vision. I wouldn't say that Russia's military is much stronger than Ukraine. By the looks of what has been happening they are fairly well matched currently with each side having advantages.

They mentioned some previous conflicts in the 20th century and the kind of ratios that successful ones had and also the not so successful ones. They all agreed even if Ukraine lost the war quickly and Russia took every single soldier in that initial wave of attack and put them on occupation detail that they didn't have close to enough manpower to effectively control Ukraine and suppress partisan activity. And that was before all the losses and diverting most of their resources to Eastern Ukraine. After all of that? I bet they are stretched *mighty thin* in a lot of places.

I think Kherson and the Sothern front in general is much more lightly defended and like you say they don't really control everything and are probably suffering from a ton of partisan style attacks if the reports are to be believed. And they probably don't have the manpower to do chase those partisans and try and catch them after attacks either.

An economist came up with something called the Big Mac index to represent this. A Big Mac costs £3.59 in Britain and US$5.81 in the United States. The implied exchange rate is 0.62. The difference between this and the actual exchange rate, is 0.75.

[https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index)

With this simple point, you can conceptualize that 1 USD dollar will buy a different amount of bread in America than it will in Russia. Since Russia doesn’t have Big Macs anymore. 

>Purchasing power parity (PPP)\[1\] is the measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies, and, to some extent, their people's living standards. In many cases, PPP produces an inflation rate equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing\_power\_parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity)

>Using PPP, one finds that Russia’s effective military expenditure actually ranged between $150 billion and $180 billion annually over the last five years. That figure is conservative; taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, Russia may well come in at around $200 billion.  
>  
>Unlike some other large military spenders — for example, Saudi Arabia and India — Russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs. This means that effective Russian military expenditure is much larger given that a ruble spent at home buys considerably more than a dollar spent abroad.

Poland is both a specialist in NATO-equipment and in Soviet-equipment. Its hard to tell which kind of equipment is getting maintenance upon specifically.

But does it really matter? In either case, Ukrainians are using artillery systems to such degree that they're wearing out (be it Soviet or NATO weapons). I guess it matters a little bit in terms of logistics / on the ground tactics (an artillery crew with a worn-out gun will be forced to be removed from battle while waiting for gun repairs). But it doesn't really change the proof that unfathomably huge numbers of artillery strikes are being used.

Ex: Some Ukrainian 2A65 Msta-B crew is removed from combat because their gun wore out. Well, fortunately USA sent a new M777 system (and a reserve-crew was placed where the old-crew was stationed, allowing the groups to ""rotate out"").

Even if its the Msta-B crew with the worn-out gun, its still proof that the M777 system was useful.

The original complaint was made by a small, sketchy company, and appears to have been done deliberately to harm the solar industry in the US.

Nuclear weapons are exorbitantly expensive to maintain due to a host of reasons, including checking for damage, corrosion, errors in guidance systems, problems with the nuclear cores, on and on and on. The people hired to do this work aren't bought at market rates: they are military. They have a set salary, and an expertise in their field. One that would earn them BANK in any private sector field, so they aren't cheap, either. 

Now let's look at the stockpiles. The US has a comparable stockpile to Russia. Both forces are claiming that they will be modernizing their weapons platforms in the near future. The US expects this to cost approximately $60 billion per year for 9 years starting in 2019.

Russia's total budget is $66 billion.

Yes, they are paying in rubles, but unless they are paying the rest of their armed forces literally with food and clothing and nothing else, there is no way they are achieving the level of maintenance, monitoring, surveillance, and repairs needed to keep their vast arsenal in combat ready condition AND modernizing it. There simply would not be enough people with the necessary skillsets who would be working for pennies when they could be earning literal millions of DOLLARS anywhere else, and yet are also numerous enough to consistently maintain the systems in question. So it's very likely that a large number of their nuclear weapons are suffering from corrosion or other poor maintenance issues, and we will never know until they are dismantled or launched, whichever occurs.

Remember this same argument was used to justify why Russia's army was to be feared: it just had different costs! It was still big, and modern, and powerful! It'd be at Paris in 3 weeks!

Except now we know better: the money wasn't used to make the army better with less, it was squandered. To assume nuclear weapons are exempt from this corruption is wishful thinking. Obviously no one wants them to launch, but we sure can't take their word on their ready status anymore.",1654553810.0,1654553586.0,t3_v5u8iw,t1_ibehgia,,4,0,0,0,0,0,

US invested heavily in mothballing properly, with vehicles prepped for storage in appropriate atmospheric conditions, indoors if possible, in a dry desert if not, things removed if that was more appropriate, engines stripped, fluids drained, and parts standardised so that the exact same part didn't have to go back on the same vehicle, or could be replaced from inventory easily.

Russia literally just parked up the vehicles (APCs, tanks, helicopters, even jets) in rows in rainy forests with harsh winters, shut the hatches, and called it a day.

In many cases, the restorers basically keep the ID and a few small parts and replace almost everything else, up to and frequently including building new panels on jigs. The car's really a clone but nobody says anything.

Russia's reserves are just dumped outside in the rain. They're not made with rustproof materials, they're made with cheap steel.

If you've got a huge steel armoured body where the steel is flaked and corroded to the core with rust, and the structural integrity is completely compromised, you don't have ""95% of the work"" already done. You've got a rotten vehicle.

If you've got an engine where the headers weren't sealed over, damp has got in, and has literally welded the piston rings to the block, it's not going to turn over, let alone start, and it may well be far beyond even a rebuild in that state.

If you've got suspension and axles and hubs and moving parts where they're cracked and disintegrating as you try moving them, you're replacing the whole lot. Better hope the spares in that tin roofed shed fared better!

So now you have a vehicle that whilst *cosmetically* looks about the right shape and has all the parts attached, there's actually almost nothing you can save.

In many cases, it would actually be *more* effort than manufacturing it from scratch because you have to undo all the problems before you start the actual build process, and you have to handbuild the replacement parts on a case-by-case basis rather than just mass producing something new.

We NEEDED global production cuts to keep oil prices from dropping below the shale band, which would have made our domestic oil and gas industry largely economically unviable. It was a deal to cut production the last administration was central to assembling, begging, wheedling, and cajoling into existence.

To pretend otherwise is naive, obtuse, or ridiculous.

Now that we're well hoisted on that potentially short-sighted petard... having to accept a murderer in the house of Saud staying in power is one of the realities of this war. If anyone is going to expand production it won't happen without them, as a matter of realpolitik. Absent a massive and generationally profound land war in Europe, nothing was empty about those threats, though.  It also didn't seem particularly populist, more internationalist/institutionalist (which fits with Biden's whole ethos,) but I'm not connected to anyone involved to know their actual motivation.

Zelensky has done an amazing job acting the role of president.  Good presidents delegate tactical military decisions to generals and colonels.  The war economy is delegated to economists and accountants. Not interfering or derailing the national effort is a mark of an excellent wartime leader. 

As a martyr Zelensky might have just as much of a positive impact.  There is a risk but the danger is much much lower than the danger faced by infantry fighting door to door across the river.  Russians will have a hard time figuring out which decoy is actually Zelensky.  Drawing the howitzers and aircraft away from the main battle could tip the battle toward Ukraine. 

No one can claim Zelensky is a coward ordering others to the front line while hiding in safety.  That image is only created if there is in fact some danger.  It does not work if there is no battle ""to close to call"".  Visiting a section of stagnant front would still be a risk but has little or no value.  An in and out dash is risky for a small fraction of the danger faced by artillery crews occupying those position all day and week.  The primary danger to Zelensky's life is intelligence related.  Someone on staff revealing the exact position.  That is real and Zelensky and his wife and children have to live with it all the time.

Market exchange rates don't represent accurately what things actually cost. 1 USD buys a different amount of bread in Russia than it does in America as a basic example. Just as it does in China or India. There is no value in conceptualizing Russian defence spending in U.S. dollars at market exchange rates. This isn't conjecture or speculation, it's fairly basic economics.

There is plenty of ink spilled on this topic and people who study these things will constantly talk about military purchasing power parity in regards to the US defence budget vs other countries. As this obviously doesn't only apply to Russia, but to every military to varying degrees. 

>Using PPP, one finds that Russia’s effective military expenditure actually ranged between $150 billion and $180 billion annually over the last five years. That figure is conservative; taking into account hidden or obfuscated military expenditure, Russia may well come in at around $200 billion.  
>  
>Unlike some other large military spenders — for example, Saudi Arabia and India — Russia also produces most of its weaponry itself and does not buy its equipment from countries with higher costs. This means that effective Russian military expenditure is much larger given that a ruble spent at home buys considerably more than a dollar spent abroad.

To put a bell on this Russia spends more than enough on defence to maintain its nuclear arsenal. And, the rise in Russian defence spending has coincided with their nuclear modernization. 

 To add more context before the current program to modernize its nuclear arsenal which is costly the US was spending 35 billion per year to maintain a nuclear arsenal that was twice the size in the mid-90s.

What needs to be factored is the proven use of similarly banned weapons in civilian areas in order to determine wether those accounts are true. 2 readily available examples of this are the proven use of incendiary munitions and cluster bombs. Both of these by nature of their design are easily proven, and have been repeatedly. So suggesting that Russia has opted to respect the Geneva convention with regards to thermobaric weapons, but decided not to with incendiaries and clusters, is short sighted. 

As for victim counts, that entirely depends on civilian density in the target area. For example - a Kalibr shot at the crowd of a rock concert would kill hundreds, but the Kalibr that was shot into an apartment complex in Kyiv when UNSG Gueterres was visiting only killed 1 person, a reporter. Both are civilian areas, And you could argue the Kalibr is inherently far more destructive a weapon.

I don't think you understand, America *wants* to give Ukraine everything it needs. They've been intensively training Ukraine since 2014. They've given billions of dollars. They're not half-assing this, nor trying to weasel out of commitments.  On the contrary, they're providing way, way more than weapons. Sanctions, training, intelligence, satellites... 
  
If they wanted to cut costs, they could turn around tomorrow and say ""sorry, the well's run dry"". They don't need to invent some convoluted plot to try and convince Ukraine give up prematurely. They're not going to tell Ukraine the money has run out though, because they're all too happy to see their defense budget going towards exactly what it was sized for, on a Russian war of aggression no less. They're happy to help Ukraine break Russia's teeth in until it has to negotiate. The proof is how ridiculously bipartisan all government actions have been.

(From Wikipedia:)

  
""A Human Rights Watch report of 1 February 2000\[18\] quotes a study made by the US Defense Intelligence Agency:  
The \[blast\] kill mechanism against living targets is unique—and unpleasant. ... What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction \[vacuum\], which ruptures the lungs. ... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate, victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common FAE fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, are highly toxic, undetonated FAE should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as with most chemical agents.  
According to a US Central Intelligence Agency study,\[18\] ""the effect of an FAE explosion within confined spaces is immense. Those near the ignition point are obliterated. Those at the fringe are likely to suffer many internal, thus invisible injuries, including burst eardrums and crushed inner ear organs, severe concussions, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness."" Another Defense Intelligence Agency document speculates that, because the ""shock and pressure waves cause minimal damage to brain tissue ... it is possible that victims of FAEs are not rendered unconscious by the blast, but instead suffer for several seconds or minutes while they suffocate"".\[19\]""",False,1654552239.0,t3_v5u8iw,t1_ibey3qu,,9,1,0,1,0,0,
