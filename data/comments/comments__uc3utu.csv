Day 62 of my updates from Kharkiv.

Today periodic shelling continued as usual, sometimes it sounds pretty close, especially at night, because that’s when they become active. Though compared to that hellish shelling 3 days ago this is nothing special, but it still puts us on edge, now more than ever. 

They also continue constantly shelling Saltivka, today they killed 3 more civilians. Our friend living there said that at the same time when our apartment building (in a different part of the city) was shelled 3 days ago theirs was hit too, it also broke their windows. From our observations they are very coordinated in their shelling, when one district gets hit, there are immediate reports of other districts being shelled simultaneously.

It honestly feels so weird when there is no shelling and everything is quiet, but it does feel good, almost as if there was no war at all, but then of course some explosions happen and ruin your day. What is even weirder is that after that shelling 3 days ago it looks like there’s now actually more people in the streets than before. People just going for a walk, kids playing, and almost all benches are occupied, some people are playing chess. It almost feels normal if not for the shelling.",1651017975.0,1651017867.0,t3_uc3utu,t3_uc3utu,,0,179,0,179,2,0,{'gid_1': 1}

In order for Russia to resupply and support any push from Transnistria they'd have to do one of two things: 

1. Push out of Kherson, take Mykolaiv, take Odessa, secure the entire Black Sea coast, all while under attack from the most defended and supplied region of Ukraine and with forces that weren't even able to take Mykolaiv at their peak.

2. Amass a landing force of naval ships, sail them right up the well defended Ukranian coast that's supplied with batches of new anti-ship missiles and already sank the flagship which can provide the best air/missile defense. Take this naval landing force they don't have ready, supply it with troops and armor they don't have ready, and successfully navigate it right up next to the coast of Ukraine to drop off troops. Then they have to continue doing this without being sunk for the duration of this push.

Neither of these outcomes are going to happen. What could happen, at best for Russia, is scenario three.


*  3. Russian forces push out of Transistria, take the isolated part of the southern coast of Odessa Oblast that is slightly cut off, maybe take a few towns in southwestern Ukraine, then be utterly annhiliated to the last unit because they've placed themselves in an encircled position with no hope of resupply and only one route of retreat, back into Moldova where even a small Moldovan force will have free time and space to destroy logistics and supply bases in Transnistria unobstructed because the entire separatist force is getting mowed down trying to walk to Odessa.

Odessa is twice the size of Mariupol and much, much further from Russian reinforcements. Russia hasn't been able to take Mariupol with a force larger and better supplied than the entire ""army"" of Transnistria. Opening up an additional front to ""Distract"" Ukraine in a region they are already defending, as Odessa has remained on guard, doesn't actually work when Ukraine can adapt much faster than Russia and has more supplies to spare than Russia at the moment.",1651003953.0,1651003564.0,t3_uc3utu,t3_uc3utu,,0,38,0,38,0,0,

**Russia halts gas supplies to Poland, reports say**

As European countries move to limit or ban supplies of Russian natural gas, there are reports from Poland that Moscow has halted deliveries to the country.  
  
The Onet.pl website says the move has been unofficially confirmed by sources in the Polish government and the country’s state gas company PGNiG.  
  
There has been no official confirmation of the news yet.  
  
PGNiG buys about 60% of Poland’s natural gas imports from Gazprom via the Yamal pipeline.  
  
If supplies have indeed been deliberately suspended by Gazprom, it would not be an immediate problem for Poland because underground storage is about 70% full and stocks can be drawn down. Also, natural gas demand is fairly low now because of the upcoming summer season.  
  
Poland plans to stop importing Russian gas by the end of the year when its long-term supply contract with Gazprom expires and a new pipeline delivering gas from Norway comes online.

*Transnistria, or the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR) as it is officially called, is a breakaway state situated between Moldova and Ukraine that has largely escaped the world's attention ever since its self-proclaimed independence as a Soviet republic in 1990 and subsequent violent secession from Moldova in 1992. Despite having ended armed conflict in 1992, the situation in Transnistria remains just as complicated as it was in the 1990s, with the ephemeral nation wishing to join the Russian Federation while continuing to remain heavily reliant on Moldova for exporting the limited produce its economy outputs.*

Speaking on CNN Newsroom, Bogner relayed the scale of civilian atrocities the mission has documented throughout the war so far, including cases of sexual violence and arbitrary detentions.  

So far the mission has documented up to 5,000 civilian casualties, Bogner said, noting the actual number will be ""thousands"" higher. Currently the UN is investigating 150 cases of enforced disappearances.

""Again, the number of cases are higher than that, these are just the cases that we have sufficient information about to already look into,"" she said. 

""We are hearing in some of the areas occupied by the Russian Federation, that they are targeting people who have pro Ukrainian views. For example, local officials, activists, human rights defenders, sometimes journalists who they consider have pro Ukrainian views are being detained. They often disappear. Some have been released, which is good, but others have since been found dead. 

""We are also trying to document cases of sexual violence. Unfortunately it's very difficult to get full information. Victims usually are not willing to speak in areas that are unsafe, when they haven't had services provided to them. 

""So it is very important that these services are provided, that people are able to have access, and move to safer areas. And it's only when that happens that we will start to get the full picture of what's really going on in the country.""",False,1650975210.0,t3_uc3utu,t3_uc3utu,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

**From CNN's Ellie Kaufman**  
  
The Department of Defense has established a control center to coordinate shipments and “streamline the delivery” of military assistance to Ukraine with both US and allied forces in Stuttgart, Germany, within the US European Command area of responsibility, a senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.  
  
The EUCOM Control Center of Ukraine, or ECCU, is based at US European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, and is run by a US two-star military general, the official said. The center works closely with what the US military calls the international donor coordination center, or IDCC, which is run by a one-star general from the United Kingdom, the official added.  
  
“This was set up to support this security system’s efforts,” the official said.   
The control center, along with US personnel, includes staff from 15 other supporting nations in Stuttgart, the official said. The control center will also manage the network of more than 40 partner and allied nations that met in Germany earlier Tuesday and are providing assistance to Ukraine, the official said.   
  
This new group of allies will meet once a month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced earlier Tuesday. The first meeting was hosted by Austin at Ramstein Air Base in Germany on Tuesday.

Bulgaria.

And now by cutting off their gas, Putin has delivered the perfect reason to forgo that neutrality.

""Russia is preparing a missile strike on the ""Transnistrian region"" with civilian casualties
April 26, 2022

Residents of the unrecognized ""Transnistrian Moldavian Republic"" receive SMSs on behalf of the Armed Forces and special services of Ukraine. They contain a warning about a ""missile and artillery"" strike on the territory of the ""Transnistrian region"".

Quote from fake message:

""Ukraine's Security Service urges the evacuation of civilians to safer regions. We assure you that the Armed Forces of Ukraine do not wish harm to civilians, but the people who remained in the cities will be perceived as sabotage groups and will be eliminated without warning. Exactly at 19.00 rocket and artillery shelling of objects on the territory of the republic will be carried out "".

These reports are actively covered by Russian propaganda information resources.

We note that the state of Ukraine has nothing to do with this and similar provocations.

Such fakes and incidents, which are likely to take place on the territory of Transnistria, are nothing more than another provocation of the Russian special services against Ukraine and Moldova.""

* Believes the war is going to last for a very, very long time
* Says Putin's nationalism is completely phony. He just wants more resources so he can steal more money for himself.
* Says Trump agreed to 'hand over' Browder to Putin at the 2018 Helsinki summit. Was going to stay away from America had Trump been re-elected.
* Only way for the war to end is a complete embargo of Russia. Or, he will push and push until he encounters 'steel' (I interpreted this as NATO intervention)

Japan will provide food and medicine to war-torn Ukraine as additional relief supplies, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday after speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by phone.  
  
Kishida told reporters after their roughly 40-minute conversation that Japan will step up diplomatic efforts to support Ukraine in cooperation with the Group of Seven nations, which are leading efforts to punish Russia for its invasion.  
  
Japan has strongly condemned Russia's onslaught against Ukraine as shaking the foundation of the international order to its core, imposing a raft of sanctions against Moscow at the expense of bilateral ties amid a long-unresolved territorial dispute.  
  
According to the Foreign Ministry, Kishida told Zelenskyy that Japan will deliver requested items, including food and medicine, as soon as possible.  
  
Within the bounds of the pacifist Constitution, Japan has so far sent or decided to provide bulletproof vests, helmets, protective masks and commercial drones since Russia's attack against its neighbor began in late February.  
  
""President Zelenskyy explained his views on future assistance and sanctions,"" Kishida told reporters.  
  
Kishida and Zelenskyy previously spoke by phone in early March.  
  
Kishida has repeatedly said any unilateral use of force to change the status quo should never be tolerated.  
  
In a rare move for a nation known for its strict immigration and refugee policy, Japan has been taking in hundreds of people fleeing Ukraine, leaving the possibility open for them to stay longer and work in the country.  
  
The government will assist the evacuated in various aspects of their lives, including finding jobs and going to school, as part of longer-term support for them, Kishida said.",False,1651031926.0,t3_uc3utu,t3_uc3utu,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

After they win (as in: keep most territory being fought over, not Russian puppet, Zelenskyy in charge) Ukraine is extremely unlikely to ever elect any anti-West candidate, let alone a pro-Russia one, and despite a shitton of corruption it will likely continue the post-2014 trend of steadily increasing. This also massively increases European security as Ukraine, the easiest and essential state for Russia to invade to ever hope to invade other former soviet republic, it's bleeding them out

It's like US popularity in Albania and Kosovo, and I can't imagine that would change for a long while.

Not to mention the field testing of equipment, new tech and destruction of Russia's ability to wage further wars and project power directly helps the West's interests (sinking the Moskva is a great example of this)

Finally, for the US, they can finally now actually ""pivot to Asia"" as Europe collectively (mainly Germany, other countries esp some in Eastern Europe already were on it from day 1) recognize the true threat to European security and spend accordingly

Long run, this'll save the US a fuckton when Europe deals with their own security, but keeps good if not better US-European ties at the same time with the US being vindicated, which always seemed unlikely but has now been achieved

https://breakingdefense.com/2022/04/facing-obsolete-parts-raytheon-struggling-to-replace-stingers-sent-to-ukraine/

>WASHINGTON: In the past two months, the United States has sent more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine, but replacing the aging weapon system will require Raytheon Technologies to redesign electronics in the missile and seeker, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes said today.

>“We’ve been working with the DoD [Department of Defense] for the last couple of weeks,” Hayes said during an earnings call.  “We’re actively trying to resource some of the material. Unfortunately, DoD hasn’t bought a Stinger in about 18 years. Some of components are no longer commercially available, and so we’re going to have to go out and redesign some of the electronics in the missile of the seeker head.

>“That’s going to take us a little bit of time,” he said.

>While the company hopes to increase Stinger production as much as it can this year, Hayes said it will likely take until the 2023 to 2024 timeframe to surge to the levels needed to recapitalize the stockpile.

>Currently, the shoulder-mounted Stinger is still in “limited production” for an international customer. That customer is providing much of the obsolete components needed for its own Stingers, and the remaining pool of obsolete parts is limited, a source told Breaking Defense. The source declined to name the partner.

>Further, much of Raytheon’s workforce is trained to manufacture the more advanced missiles currently in demand by the US services, like Tomahawk cruise missiles or the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile. In contrast, little automation is used to build the Stinger, with artisan workers doing much of the fabrication by hand, the source said.

>“Transitioning that workforce over to the munitions that are appropriate for the Ukraine fight, that requires some shift of priority and training,” Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks told Breaking Defense earlier this month. Despite those challenges, she said, Pentagon officials are working with Raytheon to look for ways to ramp up production.

>“We’ve had a lot of opportunity between the [Pentagon’s acquisition and sustainment] community… and the policy community to start thinking about how we work with other armaments directors in Europe and elsewhere to understand what they have, to start to understand the supply chain interrelationships, and see if we can speed some of that up,” she said.

>Meanwhile, the Army has begun to take steps to develop a Stinger replacement.

*Putin’s propaganda is breaking records of effectiveness.

Unfortunately, people believe it.*  
  
*All of Putin’s speeches represent a collection of rhetorical and discursive devices that have been already tried and tested by other dictators (from Hitler to Gaddafi, Mubarak, Saddam Hussein and others). Despite its apparent diversity, their language boils down to a few recurring and rather simple linguistic techniques.*

summary- 

Sighetu Marmatiei - A heartbreaking human drama is playing out along Ukraine's borders - fleeing refugees pass the homesick going back, while others who left and then returned flee for their lives for a second time.  
  
Hundreds of thousands of refugees are returning home, determined to stay.  
  
Theirs is a story typical of the tides of despair and hope pushing and pulling the waves of refugees.  
  
Despite the dangers of a war entering what could be an even bloodier second phase, hundreds of thousands have decided to return to Ukraine and stick it out.  
  
To try to tell all these stories, the AFP team drove 2,500 kilometres along the length of Ukraine's western frontier earlier this month, from the northernmost crossing in Dorohusk, Poland, hard by Belarus, to Isaccea in Romania in the south on the banks of the Danube.  
  
Apart from Poland, where many of the nearly three million refugees it welcomed have decided to stay for now, most just transit the countries bordering Ukraine.  
  
Jehovah's Witnesses - who are omnipresent along the border - have set up opposite a Sikh food truck, while Israeli organisations rub shoulders with Egyptian Red Crescent workers.  
  
A dozen kilometres to the west at the bustling Przemysl train station, a jovial French Catholic missionary from Calcutta, Brother Francois, is handing out meals and blankets and providing information to exhausted and disoriented refugees.  
  
A town of 60,000 people that has seen up to 55,000 refugees arrive daily, Przemysl is ""The world capital of volunteering"", its mayor Wojciech Bakun said proudly.  
  
Police officers were warming themselves around a wood fire when a young Ukrainian woman arrived with a baby strapped to her chest and two other children in tow.  
  
Having crossed the border, she looked up at the sky, closed her eyes, and a tear rolled silently down her cheek.  
  
""We have not had a single problem with the refugees,"" the police chief said.  
  
The contrast is striking with the situation in the north, along the Poland-Belarus border.  
  
All along the Ukrainian border, the flow of refugees has slowed in the past few weeks.  
  
Since Ukraine doesn't allow men between the ages of 18 and 60 - those of fighting age - to leave, some 90 percent of refugees are women and children.  
  
In the Polish town of Korczowa near the Ukrainian border, a shopping mall that has gone out of business has been converted into a refugee reception centre, with beds lined up in rows, and the sound of children playing echoing in the distance.  
  
Libraries Without Borders have set up shop in an empty store, with Ukrainian children laughing and chatting as they read books and play board and video games.  
  
""We have children who arrive with signs of post-traumatic stress, and we steer them toward activities that will distract them from the life they have been living for weeks,"" said Clemence Loupandine of LWB. Back in Hungary at the Zahony train station, two Britons in zany outfits hand toys donated by British children to kids stepping off the trains from Ukraine.  
  
More than a million people are estimated to have returned to Ukraine after fleeing, either because the fighting has moved away from their homes or because they just can't stand being away.  
  
Appearing out of nowhere on a sunny day, a smiling Kateryna Bolotova turned up at the small Moldovan border post in Palanca.  
  
""Before the war, I travelled every month. I've been to 25 countries, but this trip from Germany back to my Ukraine was the best,"" she declared.  
  
If she ever has to flee Odessa again, she won't leave Ukraine, Bolotova insisted.  
  
Between those who leave with heavy hearts and those returning with renewed hope and determination, there are others marooned at the border, whose lives are on hold.  
  
Briton Anthony Phillips wanted to fight for Ukraine's ""Foreign legion"".  
  
""I've been an orphan since the age of six. What touched me the most was stories about children leaving Ukraine with no parents, no clothes, nothing. It felt like me again..."".  
  
In Chisinau in Moldova, Viktoria Logvynova, a sprightly Ukrainian woman in her 80s, is stuck in a refugee reception centre.  
  
Ukraine's second city is taking the brunt of the new Russian offensive.  
  
A quarter of Ukraine's population is over 60, according to Justin Derbyshire, of the charity HelpAge, who warned of ""The devastating impact"" it was having on them.  
  
A ferry was shuttling passengers across the Danube to Isaccea in Romania and back, a fitting symbol of the to-and-fro across Ukraine's border.

Russia successfully bombed five train stations in Western Ukraine on Monday. If any significant damage was done to the locomotives this could degrade Ukraine’s ability to resupply the front lines with ammo and new equipment. More worrying, it signals that Russia may employ increased long range strikes against infrastructure in the future, which will arguably be much more effective than some of their other tactics have been so far.

Russian forces are advancing steadily along the Izyum axis. Their units appear to be pushing forward at a controlled pace and coordinating their movements so they can support each other, and the result is that it isn’t another massive clusterfuck like the Kyiv offensive of last month. It’s not clear how much resistance they’re facing on this axis. It’s likely that Ukrainian forces did not have defensive positions really built up in this area, like they do along the south-east front lines.

Russian units are failing to make progress anywhere else along the front lines. The Ukrainians have continued to destroy Russian heavy equipment in multiple locations using primarily indirect fire. A trickle of videos on Twitter supports this assertion, but I imagine the videos show only the tip of the iceberg in terms of volume.

I have not found any video or report showing the use of US-provided switchblade or Phoenix ghost drone systems. My guess (pulled directly out of my ass) is that while quite a few of these weapons may be in country, they have not been deployed to the front lines yet. It’s also possible that UA is using them and not publicizing it. It’s also possible (I’m not a Russian shill by the way) a quantity of these weapons were destroyed or captured in transit.

In Mariupol the situation remains unchanged. Russia targeted the azovstal plant with 36 airstrikes in the past day and limited fighting continues in some areas around the plant.

They are absolutely minuscule state whos Air Force (if they have one?) and armored vehicle force would be eliminated within days by Ukrainian air and artillery. And also it’s extremely unlikely they would even get involved in the first place, if Belarus refused to send troops then I have a hard time believing they would either. Lastly, if they attempted to invade some of Ukraine along with the 2000 Russian troops stationed there I think it would be highly likely Moldova would get involved as well, leaving a tiny and thin pseudo-nation totally surrounded by hostile states, without able to trade or get resources from anywhere as there would be a total land and air embargo enforced by Ukrainian and Moldovan air forces. It just makes no sense to me that they would get involved, but I guess the Russians have done really stupid stuff before.

I don't know whether that's true, although it seems unlikely to me that the wells aren't at very least fitted with some sort of adjustable valve—after all, how else would seasonal demand fluctuations be managed: by diverting the excess into storage tanks?!  Indeed, oil (but perhaps not gas?) is often *pumped* from wells rather than merely released under its own pressure.

Can anyone confirm?

If it is indeed the case that Russia is unable to reduce the rate of production, and alternative customers are hard to reach (eg lack of sufficient available gas liquefaction and tanker/shipping infrastructure), what will happen with the excess?

Russia can fight on but they have no way of replacing their losses with anything like the same standard. 

They have more manpower to call upon (barely, general mobilisation is not ideal and they really have a shrinking youth population that's smaller than their total *losses* during WW2), but nothing else. Their manufacturing is a shadow of the USSR, they're suffering insane brain drain, the youth aren't going into military engineering because it's not the glamorous job it was in the Soviet era, so they just can't make stuff in quantity, at all. Not even equipment that's to the same lower standards as the old Soviet gear. Fun fact is that the average age of a Russian military engineer (in manufacturing) is about 60. The standard deviation on that is very small - almost all of them are within 5 years of retirement age (61 in Russia) - virtually zero new blood after the fall of the USSR, essentially.

They blew a huge chunk of their ""elite"" troops early on with failed assaults that the US has now confirmed did involve hugely devastating shoot-downs by Ukraine of those transports full of VDV troopers. There's a decent chance that a substantial proportion of Russian Spetsnaz / Special Forces, who take *years* to train, are dead. Their reserves are mostly non-combat and any new combat troops will be lightly trained. Ukraine has had a steady programme of rotating its troops in and out of reserve and that's showing now, they've got more troops with more training and more experience.

Russia is seemingly failing, after 60 days and very little resupply to the UAF, to gain any kind of air superiority and its ground attack aircraft are relying on distant shoot-and-scoots with unguided rockets right now. They seem to be running lower on guided missiles of all flavours, they've lost their flagship to a nation that barely had a navy, they've lost more tanks than most nations even *have* and their reserves look to be mostly garbage that doesn't even start.

Oh, and they keep losing generals, plural, in a single Ukrainian strike.

This is the tipping point of attrition and it's falling in Ukraine's favour, much to a lot of early speculators' surprise.",False,1651007856.0,t3_uc3utu,t1_i6bchbu,,1,12,0,12,0,0,

Russia has a long history of covering up the disasters. Especially, made by themselves. The perfect example of this is Chornobyl. It actually happened on this day, April 26th, in 1986.

So, there are several reasons why not to send or report dead people from Moscow to war. The main one: they need all the military forces within the city in case of uprising from within.

The cope is real.

Combat experience is only worth something if a)soldiers survive b) learn from the mistakes. Something Russians are unable to do and will continue to be unbale to do until you know they stop fudging the numbers and selling off equipment when no-one is looking.

NATO militaries can afford to sit in bases because they would've bombed the living shit out of infrastructure, air defenses and within the 1st week and ground forces would've had carte blanche to do whatever they want.

What weapons are being destroyed? Javelins, MANPADS, NLAWS maybe UAV's and small arms. For all intents and purposes disposable equipment. BAyraktars are probably the most expensive piece of kit being destroyed but they earned their keep. $150-$200K manpad vs $2mil+ tank/helicopter/airplane.

Edit: copying his 14 points in sum:

>The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

>The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

>The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

>Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

>Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

>Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

>The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.”

>The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

>Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

>Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

>Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

>Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

>Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

>Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

I'm not convinced the second of these sets contains any voices other than Putin's own.  Possibly Bortnikov, but anyone who says they know what's really going on in his head is lying. 

The immediate succession stipulates the PM Mikhail Mishustin becomes acting president.  He's a multi-millionaire Moscow elitist, but hasn't had much to say about the war.  I consider it almost definite that he'd immediately suspend operations and find a way out of the war as quickly as possible through the negotiating table.

Yeah, this actually falls in line with Russia's military tradition of being absolutely incompetent. Hard to find a nation that hasn't embarrassed Russia militarily in their vicinity.

Russia's military performance was likely not as big a factor in the analysis as you think.  

The calculation was probably significantly informed by the evaluation of whether Ukrainians would be willing and able to stand up and fight.  And there were reasons to believe that they would not -- at least not in large organized battalions that could hold ground against a mechanized army.  After all, remember we literally just watched the huge U.S.-trained Afghan national army disappear in a matter of days.

The fact that a week before the invasion--even though the U.S. had been warning about it for weeks--the Ukrainian media and public still seemed to be completely disbelieving the possibility that an invasion would happen would strongly point toward a population that could be too shocked to respond to such an attack.  

And psychological warfare is a major part of Russian tactics, which could likely exacerbate those problems with the public. 

And it was also not clear whether the pro-Russian sections of the population were organized and ready to assist the Russian invaders (like they were in Donbas and Crimea).

There are a lot of good reasons why analysts expected Ukraine to fall.

So they may specialise in Russian international politics, or geopolitics in general or just whatever think tank they represent and are told 'just basically brief this paper we did'.

In those cases, they'd just do some quick light reading on Russia's AF on the fly and then Ukraine's and do some napkin logic with their prior knowledge.

The key components that led to this shit-show are logistics (often overlooked as it's a military-specific spectrum of interest and a generally boring one for most) and Ukraine's will to fight and sense of identity - not something you'd know by default without having spent time with many Ukrainians. (Although there were some obvious indicators, such as the breakaway vote in 91 being something stupidly huge like 90%).

There were experts and analysts that got this right, they were just drowned out by the 'Russia has modernised and will crush Ukraine' narrative that's been 'common sense' in many areas for a long time.

Edit: another important thing - military planning; any experienced military commander or leader should have at least crunched the facts as we knew them in Feb and got to 'messy shitshow'. The military planning process goes through lots of different elements.

There are a lot of elements in the mix that were against Russia, from Rasputitsa and lines of supply (weak against insurgency and asymmetrical warfare) to force numbers, Ukraine having 1+million once mobilised vs 200k.

I can’t remember if it the first time in their history that they were independent (sorry - going by memory and no Google).   It was historically aligned with Romania.

The Dniester River runs through Moldova on the East.  After 1991 the USSR fell and there was much disarray.  In 1992 there was a small war between Moldova and some Russia-supporters.  The West Bank of the River (yes, that is accurate) broke away from Moldova proper.  This small strip of land became known as Trans-Dniestria; or Transnistria.  It was the more heavily-industrialized part of Moldova and was highly-desirable for Russia who needed to try to maintain influence where they could.

Fast forward to now: Transnistria is almost as foreign to Moldova as Russia.  It is still officially recognized as Moldova, but has been run completely separately for three decades and running.  The big “Russian Presence” there is essentially a big police force with families and community ties to the area.

Russia has squirreled away equipment there; but it is hard to know what since they keep them so shut off from the outside - specifically Moldova and UN monitors.

Russia sees value in Transnistria as a western anchor to their ambitions to create Novorussia with control of the entire northern Black Sea.

tl;dr - breakaway region of Moldova, supported by Russia and home to a small garrison of troops and an indeterminate amount of weapons.  Industrialized, but cut off and outdated.  Right now it’s greatest significance is that it is a little island of Russian ambition between two countries they formerly oppressed and do not like them much.

One of Russia's big fears before this war was Ukraine, a former Soviet state, and quite a large one, becoming a more significant power than Russia itself. Considering that Russia sees most former Soviet states as rightfully Russian, that is an unthinkable thought for many in the Russian regime.

Ukraine was well placed to be the state that pulled this off. Politically, very progressive, having made similar changes to those seen in the Baltics, although with further to go after a long period of corruption and uncertainty early on. Large, physically, with a well balanced population and affordable cost of living, even in the cities which are modern and well-maintained. Fantastic production of food and other resources. Undeveloped oil and gas fields with increasing interest from Western partners. Excellent heavy industry including aerospace and maritime - they actually make rocket engines that Russian weapons use! Rapidly growing digital sector, Ukraine was on the verge of becoming the ""it"" place for outsourcing programming and software development - higher quality than the Far East / India, good level of spoken English, excellent time-zone match-up for most EU businesses, but still substantially cheaper than most of Europe.

Within a few years of now, Ukraine was on course for EU membership, and being, potentially, a shining example of a European nation. Russia could not fathom that when they were failing, and could not stand for it.

They are often playing up the threat of Russia to create more tension...

They also (by numbers) spend a lot of time showing death and destruction over and over, which begins to create a negative psychological narrative.

And then many of them have been giving far too much airtime/article space to 'experts' with very little actual expertise. Although this last point has improved a fair bit so far.

Western media often tries to show 'both sides' of a story and give them equal weight or time. The issue with this should be obvious but isn't; some sides are far more wrong or misinformed than others. A good bad example is climate change; despite 90+% of climate scientists saying it's a thing, for years you would see one explaining the 90% opinion, and another explaining a counter-narrative, giving them 50% weight each...

We also see this in casualty numbers and estimates. Part of the allied intel system is to take each sides estimate as an extreme and try and find a middle ground with other information. But that is designed around both sides being wrong, not necessarily true.

So sailing through the Bosphorus anyway would majorly piss off Turkey.  

Furthermore they'd have to give quite a lot of naval firepower to even the odds, which seems unlikely. It's not just handing off a single destroyer and expecting it to win against the 95% intact Black Sea Fleet.

Second, Russia does not have the numbers even if it does fully mobilize to maintain teh incredibly manpower taxing mission of both invading and holding enemy territory. 3rd, Russia's logistical lines continue to suck ass even when they are operating less than 50 miles from their staging grounds. 4th, Economics: Ukraine's economy may be in the shitter right now, but they operating off cheat codes, their actual economy right now is NATO and the EU; and the US alone has many States whose GDP is above Russia's pre-sanctions GDP. 5th, production: The sanctions have forced the shut down of several of Russia's arms factories, and they are lacking so many critical parts that they really just can't produce the weapons they need; Meanwhile Western Military Industrial Complex goes ""Brrrrrt!""

Ukraine is in positions that have been fortified for 8 years, while putler  keeps sending what few men he has left to attack them, and they may get a little gain, at the cost of dozens of men, but now they are in a Ukrainian kill box and the land is quickly retaken.

Meanwhile, in February when the war started Ukraine FULLY mobilized their population (IE the draft), and about May 9th that will be 10 weeks of basic training and ~200k bloodthirsty young men are gonna head to the front wanting some personal answers for Bucha and Mariupol.

And those men will have more tanks, more artillery, more drones, more discipline and more heart and humanity than russia could ever dream of.

Why? How does that assist peace rather than a desire to be entertained or enthralled by war? Edit: for the record I ask this because it seems disconnected from everything else and just yet another bad faith ask. Anything presented will be summarily dismissed as propaganda as all available evidence has been. 


>	Sure you can’t believe what Russia is saying but there is no way Ukraine is giving us the truth on where everything sits.

The two aren’t even really comparable in this regard and I don’t understand the point here. It’s like saying you can’t trust China and Japan fully. Geopolitics is messy and the world isn’t so clear cut that one side is always right and the other always wrong. Russia absolutely has valid criticism about NATO, for example. But it doesn’t mean they can invade, annex, and genocide to their heart’s content. 

>	I just want this war to be over. The world should be suing for peace, not blowing itself up

False equivocation. Only one country, possibly two if we count Belarus, are suing for war. You’ll note that every other country wants peace from this unprovoked assault. But calling for peace doesn’t mean you let things happen to your country and people. 


Come on now. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are rotting in mass graves because Russian soldiers put them there, while even more have been forcibly relocated into the heart of Russia so Russian nationals can colonize Ukrainian territory.

I'll set out my arguments, based on what I personally believe to be plausible, and brace for the downvotes (because I'm well aware it's not a popular opinion). 

Let me begin by saying I don't buy into the argument that the West would retaliate, and that this possibility would somehow deter a Russian attack. Ukraine isn't formally under any nuclear umbrella (except for China's, but I strongly doubt they would honor the document). I believe that the use of nuclear weapons, especially strategic, inside Ukraine would inherently reinforce Russia's nuclear deterrence against retaliatory strikes. 

Second, I believe the Russian establishment (going well beyond just Putin) have reached a political point of no return. They simply cannot afford to lose what they deem a proxy war against NATO. If they do, the nationalist frenzy they whipped up will turn against them. It would be political, and as a result perhaps literal, suicide. At that point they will need to deliver a win by any means. 

I feel my second point, being about short term survival, outweighs any deterrence from medium to long term effects resulting from (possible) further international condemnation (I believe several, but not all, current neutrals would get on board with sanctions). 

As a result, I believe that Russia would, if faced with a total loss scenario, resort to nuclear weapons. I'll now accept your downvote, but would much prefer your arguments.",1650985718.0,1650985462.0,t3_uc3utu,t1_i69pygq,,1,2,0,2,0,0,

At least they maybe looked at a map first, this would require doing the extra step and thinking about it for 5 seconds. 

Destroying the bridge people are referring to doesn't do anything to help create a pincer movement. It actually makes it harder, given the Russian forces would be landing on the opposite side of the destroyed bridge and stuck their. It also somehow thinks damaging (the bridge is still usable) a single bridge would disable Ukraine's entire coastal defense network. Russia has been afraid to even sail close to Ukrainian held coast after losing the Moskva, and they are even more vulnerable to air and missile attack without their flagship. Any landing force that sails up that way is going to be annihilated, and destroying that one bridge does nothing to help avoid that.

Again, this is without even addressing that Russia DOESNT HAVE the naval power to spare, the manpower to spare, the armor to spare to even fill up enough ships to go and complete this doomed-to-fail plan.

Agree.

The announcements we are seeing now will start to bear fruit in about a month when there is a major build up in western military equipment in service in eastern Ukraine and enough trained people to operate it. And once that process starts, it will snowball as more and more western equipment flows in, damaged or destroyed soviet equipment is replaced and their ammunition stocks are exhausted, whilst western governments get bolder and better coordinated in their arms supplies. Western governments have also crossed the psychological barrier of supplying heavy equipment- now that they are doing that and the russian threats of response are looking empty, the overwhelming sentiment is going to be to give Ukraine what it needs to force russia end the war as quickly as possible.

 >The Second World is a term used during the Cold War for the industrial socialist states that were under the influence of the Soviet Union. In the first two decades following World War II, 19 communist states emerged; all of these were at least originally within the Soviet sphere of influence, though some (notably, Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of China) broke with Moscow and developed their own path of socialism  while retaining Communist governments. Most communist states remained part of this bloc until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991; afterwards, only five Communist states remained: China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam.

In China, they are regarded as among the unequal treaties.

 >Prior to the 17th century China and Russia were on opposite ends of Siberia, which was populated by independent nomads. By about 1640 Russian settlers had traversed most of Siberia and founded settlements in the Amur River basin. From 1652 to 1689, China's armies drove the Russian settlers out, but after 1689, China and Russia made peace and established trade agreements. By the mid-19th century, China's economy and military lagged far behind the colonial powers.
 
**[Sino-Soviet border conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_border_conflict)** 
 
 >The Sino-Soviet border conflict was a seven-month undeclared military conflict between the Soviet Union and China in 1969, following the Sino-Soviet split. The most serious border clash, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 near Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, which led to a return to the status quo.

First Zelenskyy says that he wants Asian countries to “change their attitude” over Ukraine even though many countries HAVE supported them both in UN votes and in aid despite Ukraine being close to China, a major destabilizing factor in the region, before the war. 

For example, they sold China their aircraft carrier Liaoning which is causing a lot of problems for Asian security. 

Now there are obviously nuances but it should be understood that people feel like they have been giving their support despite the fact that Ukraine never really cared about the region in the first place and now the support is not appreciated. It comes across as ungrateful. And yes, I understand the need to drum up support. Nevertheless, that is the sentiment. 

For reference, Russia remembered to put us all on unfriendly lists. If Russia can remember to be petty, the PR people should remember to add a few countries to their video and triple check it knowing that a little effort goes a long way. Countries like Taiwan for example count their recognition very carefully and this small gesture could've netted them millions of dollars more. 

Then they insult an ally (Japan) during a time of war. Regardless of if it is truth or not, that is an unnecessary move which further contrasts Ukraine's perceived contempt towards Asian countries compared to ""western"" allies. 

The feeling over here is basically ""oh, NOW you care? "". Because they've never tried to be a friend to anyone until they need something from you. And even now, they are still not trying to do the bare minimum to be friends.

Firstly, just because a strategy is not a good strategy does not mean it isn't a Russian strategy.  We are seeing quite a lot of not-very-good strategy play out here.   

Second, you seem to think that the only military objective here is Odessa, and that a ""pincer"" movement is necessary.   All that is necessary is to have people carrying arms in a territory to claim it.  

Third, Odessa is not the prize here.   Nor is a ""land bridge"" - to Crimea or anywhere.   The prize here is the gas-fields off the coast of Ukraine.   That gas alone, at market prices, could pay for the rebuilding of Ukraine several times over.   

What matters in claims of underwater territory is the nearest coastline.   If you did what you are advising others to do and spend five seconds looking at a map with a protractor and a ruler, you'll see that Odessa is geometrically irrelevant in a claim for offshore gas rights.  What *is* relevant is that little bit of coastline south of Moldova.  Together with Crimea, those territories ""claim"" the gas fields.  And being mostly a park, it isn't particularly densely populated. 

Now... the part about the difference between taking territory and holding territory is well made.  However, again that calculus is equivalently valid in the east of Ukraine and doesn't seem to worry Russia there, so it just might cross the mind of a thoughtful person that it also won't worry Russia in this case.

 >The Transnistria War (Romanian: Războiul din Transnistria; Russian: Война в Приднестровье) was an armed conflict that broke out on 2 November 1990 in Dubăsari (Russian: Дубосса́ры, Dubossary) between pro-Transnistria (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR)) forces, including the Transnistrian Republican Guard, militia and neo-Cossack units (which were supported by elements of the Russian 14th Army), and pro-Moldovan forces, including Moldovan troops and police. Fighting intensified on 1 March 1992 and, alternating with ad hoc ceasefires, lasted throughout the spring and early summer of 1992 until a ceasefire was declared on 21 July 1992, which has held.

NATO was created to provide collective security against Communist expansion driven by the USSR.  After the USSR collapsed, there was interest in Russia and the former Warsaw Pact joining the alliance.  However, there are minimum standards for membership

[https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/eur/fs\_members.html](https://1997-2001.state.gov/regions/eur/fs_members.html)

Russia did not meet these minimum standards, and trying to meet those would threaten the kleptocracy that formed in the chaos of the Yeltsin years.  There was a vested interest in the Russian oligarchs in NOT joining NATO.  The rest of Eastern Europe developed into something other than a cluster fuck and joined NATO/EU. Germany was trying to pursue something along those lines with their economic appeasement of Russia - that's the idea behind the entire EU project.

Thanks for the reminder!

I think the issue is around the simultaneous nature of the explosion of one very big bomb vs. the multiple (not so simultaneous) nature of the explosion of several hundreds of smaller bombs.

Don't get me wrong, if you sent a cruise missile into a very large ordinance depot, you will get a very large bang, then a long series of more and more bangs (and probably a whole lot of ordinance that may not go bang until you sent a few more cruise missiles into the whole storage area).

If you dropped a 25kiloton MOAB, you will get one very very very big bang.

This group that is worse equipped and worse trained than Russia's army will be making a completely unsupported push into defended Ukrainian territory along what path exactly? 

Are they supposed to take Odessa by themselves? Mind you Odessa is twice the size of Mariupol with two extra months to prepare and the entire Russian army hasn't taken Mariupol despite being literally right on the border of it. Russia never got past Mykolaiv and is slowly collapsing around Kherson so it's not like they'll be able to provide backup.

So again, do you seriously think a couple thousand completely unsupported militia members could secure a safe route...anywhere?

Moldova doesn't have to just sit around doing nothing while this happens also. What happens to Transnistria when the entire Russian friendly militant force is killed trying to march unsupported into/past Odessa? Keep in mind they'll be extremely far from any air defense or support, Russia has been afraid to fly jets and helicopters deep into Ukraine and the destruction of the Moskva eliminated their best air defense asset in Southern Ukraine.

So this minimally trained, poorly armed, unsupplied rabble without heavy armor, artillery, or air support will be walking to Odessa while able to be freely pummeled from the air and from range, walking into defended ground, with zero chance of relief reinforcement or resupply. While Moldova is freely able to retake the areas they've vacated, further denying any chance of being supplied from Transnistria with what little ammo they do have stockpiled.

I mean sure Russia could try a plan that stupid but it's the only outcome will be the destruction of their forces, while Ukraine already has a significant defense force tied down in Odessa anyway as a precaution so it wouldn't seriously distract from the eastern front.",1650991428.0,1650990947.0,t3_uc3utu,t1_i6a9cs7,,3,1,0,1,0,0,

Trump also said he saw no problem with corporate consolidation that vastly exacerbated the rampant price gouging/inflation we see now.

2020: In their annual Economic Report of the President, released on Thursday, Mr. Trump and his advisers effectively dismiss an emerging line of economic research that finds large American companies increasingly dominate industries like telecommunications and tech, stifling competition and hurting consumers.

That research, which President Barack Obama’s economic team championed in 2016, has become fodder for presidential candidates like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont to call for breaking up big tech companies.

In its report, the Trump administration contends that the studies that demonstrate rising market concentration in the economy are flawed — and that the rise of large companies may not be a bad thing for consumers.

This outcome would be devastating for the Ukrainian economy and compound the high Costs associated with rebuilding the country after heavy bombardments and schelling that is occuring.

While true, the caveat that is necessary to apply there is that this assumes the situation doesn't change. Ukraine doesn't have enough heavy weapons (like artillery) to counterattack over a large enough front over a sustained enough time to make significant territorial gains, while they have sufficient lighter weapons to prevent Russia from making too many gains at a time.

Once Ukraine starts getting heavier weapons in, the military situation can very well change. And this leaves aside the economic perspective. Russia's economy is propped up by emergency measures that can only last so long until the slack is just totally gone from their economy. Once that hits, they'll start running into serious problems. Rumors are growing that there's a vocal contingent of the Duma that's demanding that the economy could be bolstered by just running the Ruble's printing presses 24/7 for a few weeks. Once that happens the economy there will just slam down into the floor and Russia will run into the problem that their soldiers just can't be paid.

Soldiers that aren't being paid sometimes work out, if they are defending their nation from an outside aggressor. But trying to use your army offensively, in a war that is going so poorly that troop morale is in the toilet, and then telling the soldiers they aren't getting paid is a recipe for mass desertions and order refusals.

Meanwhile multiple Western nations are committing to all sorts of economic aid packages, the US and UK have already removed nearly all tariffs on Ukrainian goods and other nations are likely to follow suit shortly. The West is virtually guaranteed to pay to help rebuild Ukraine, while nobody is stepping up to commit to the same with Russia.

In short, stalemate favors Ukraine. They might temporarily lose large swaths of the east in the coming weeks, but there's a fair amount of reason to be optimistic that this loss will be strictly temporary.",False,1650952837.0,t3_uc3utu,t1_i68cv2r,,3,2,0,2,0,0,

Gas can either refer to gasoline or natural gas but neither are petroleum. It's a little confusing because both gasoline and natural gas be can refined or found with petroleum in some cases but petroleum itself is known as crude oil or simply oil. 

This use of ""gas"" or gasoline is actually a little bit more accurate than using petroleum or petrol because petroleum by definition is unrefined oil which can be used in all sorts of applications but will probably cause your car to breakdown if you put it in the fuel tank if it's a gasoline engine. 

For natural gas is still more accurate to call it gas because while most of time they find natural gas in oil fields there are some cases where natural gas is found without petroleum. 

So in short:
Gas = Gasoline or Natural Gas
Crude, Crude Oil, or Oil = Petroleum 

I'm not bashing Europe's use of Petrol for gasoline I get it gasoline is refined from petroleum but I'm just giving insight into why Gas in the U.S. refers to gasoline or natural gas.

Germany would never have allowed that. I posit that the US was not in a position to help either country when they were invaded by Germany. 

Also keep in mind propaganda. Hitler was quite popular in the US in the 30s because he was seen as doing great things in Germany.

Just four months before the US entered the war. So we can’t really blame the US for ignoring it.

So I’m not entirely certain what your point is.

The US didn’t want to support Ukraine early on because there was an incorrect consensus the they couldn’t hold on.

They did pre-dawn raids to take out the coastal guns but the big success of D-Day was that they landed on beaches far from a port, where the defences were thinner, enabling them not just to gain a foothold but to actually retain it in the face of counterattacks, and to move forwards once they had positions on the shore. A huge amount of the reason D-Day worked was that the allies solved the problem of supplying an established beachhead on days 2-7 without controlling a major port and harbour - they simply brought their own: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulberry_harbour

This was a move completely unexpected by the Germans and totally out of nowhere. Without it, their troops would have struggled to move further inland and every subsequent wave would have been an additional amphibious landing.

What's not so widely remembered is that D-Day wasn't attempt number 1. The Allies *tried*, two years earlier, an assault (in an ""if it works it works, if not we learned"" kind of way) on a port city, an area that Germany *was* expecting an assault: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieppe_Raid 

It is one of the largest Allied military disasters of WW2. They held their position for less than six hours, made most of their gains because the Germans thought it was too soon for an attack, and lacked air support or heavy naval support. Their tanks and armoured vehicles generally remained trapped on the beach because they didn't bring engineering vehicles, so the infantry moved up unsupported. They lost more than 50% of the invasion force in a single day, a Royal Navy destroyer was sunk, and the Canadians bore the bulk of the losses which strained relationships amongst Allied forces for years. Most modern historians agree that Dieppe was doomed to fail, and this wasn't just because they used inexperienced troops (with good morale) - even elite veteran soldiers with naval landing experience (e.g. US Marines from the Pacific war) would not have been able to complete the objectives.

The lessons from Dieppe are summarised as:

1. A need for preliminary support, aerial and naval bombardment.

2. Surprise

3. Intelligence concerning enemy fortifications

4. Not attacking a defended port directly

5. The need for specialist landing and engineering vehicles deployed correctly.

It's a lot like a wedding with a wedding planner. (I'm also planning my wedding. So forgive the tortured analogy)

&#x200B;

If you want a breakdown it goes like this:

SecDef says we need to convene a meeting make this happen, let me know if there are road blocks.

General A says ""Yes sir""

Gen A reaches out to Col B.

Col B starts coordinating with various State Dept staff and DoD staff. For NATO it's pretty easy. For countries like Kenya and other nations that we're building alliances with? It's a bit more involved. They may want more attention, an invite from SecDef himself. etc.

Invites are sent. Countries accept or decline. (this is rarely a surprise, more of a formality) 

Mid-level logistics folks get involved at every level to make sure it runs smoothly. Things like seating order are actually somewhat important, some folks are easygoing some are not. So there's a Protocol office that usually helps... mitigate that.

Then the big day happens. Decisions are made.

Germany says, ""We will do ""X"""" and you see that cluster of people off to the right there in the photo? They take notes.

France says, ""We'll do ""Y"""" etc.
