Day 359-360 of my updates from Kharkiv.

The last 2 days were somewhat quiet, there weren’t any massive missile strikes, but there was one very weird and very small missile strike this morning that honestly came out of nowhere and ended abruptly. Nothing happened yesterday other than some air raid alerts, but today at around 8:30am we were suddenly alerted about missiles being fired by ships in the Black Sea. 

We thought that this was going to be the start of a new massive missile strike, but it turned out that they only fired 4 missiles total and that was the end of it. Out of the 4 Kalibrs that were launched, 2 were shot down, but 2 others managed to get through our air defense. Both of those hit Khmelnytskyi, one of them struck a military target, which is a pretty rare target for Russians, but the second missile hit some street with residential buildings, damaging many of them and shattering thousands of windows. Thankfully nobody died, but 2 civilians were injured.

There are actually some pretty good news concerning energy situation in our country. There were no blackouts pretty much anywhere in the country in about a week now, and the reason for that is that we have no energy deficit anymore, it’s actually the opposite, as apparently, we have enough of it now that we can start exporting electricity again. This is seriously just astounding, Russians fired hundreds of missiles at our energy infrastructure in order to cause blackouts, but they completely failed as we can see it now. Of course, a lot of our infrastructure still needs to be repaired after the strikes and it will take months to do it, but the fact we have no blackouts right now is a pretty unbelievable achievement in itself, especially considering just how much of a beating our energy infrastructure took.",False,1676763003.0,t3_1156bk4,t3_1156bk4,,0,158,0,158,0,0,

Göring: Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.

Gilbert: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.

Göring: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

**What does the data show?**

In short, Ukraine controls 80.1% of her core territory (incl. Crimea, Donbas), which is up from the low-point of 71.9% on March 22. Prior to February's invasion, control was at 90.9%.

Since the latest Russian offensive began around Bakhmut in late January, Russian forces have captured approximately 12 square miles, at a cost of at least 6,000 Russian soldiers killed. As many as 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in this engagement.

🔴 Russian KIAs are an estimated 49,000 (± 4,900), with a 30-day average of 200 KIA per day, significantly increased from last month's 40 KIA per day average.

🟡 Ukrainian KIAs are an estimated 18,900 (± 900), with a 30-day average of 80 KIA per day, also significantly up from last month's 20 KIA per day average.

In short, to track territorial control I run simple colour analysis on the daily update maps published by ISW, and chart how these colour proportions (one for Russia, one for Ukraine) have changed throughout the war. Graphs should be taken as illustrative rather than scientific.

I'm curious if Germany will reach the 2%. 

According to media reports, the chancellor and the party leader of the SPD support him, but the question is where the money will come from.  

The FDP, one of the government's coalition partners, wants to comply with the debt brake without ifs or buts.  But the Ministry of Defense would need an extra 10 billion, which the minister has demanded.  

With no new debt, the money would probably have to be taken from somewhere else.  (Unless they give the Ministry of Defense the permitted new debt of 12 billion, according to the debt brake and the other ministries get nothing)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxGxCTuuj8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxGxCTuuj8w)

The three experts here seem to agree that while Putin is clearly losing the war and Ukraine leadership is framing things in terms of maximalist goals, talks will most likely resume at some point and Putin could get a ""consolation prize"" of some sort (I predicted Crimea, but we'll see). Right now it's all about giving Zelensky the strongest possible hand for those upcoming negotiations. 

Of course, I hope I and they are wrong and that Ukraine gets EVERYTHING back. Whatever the case, once this war is over, Ukraine should be fast-tracked into NATO so Russia will never be tempted to go for another grab.",False,1676740294.0,t3_1156bk4,t3_1156bk4,,0,15,0,15,0,0,

I am sure you have heard recent news about 400 planes already - there are some Ukrainian analysts believing they will go all out in a Pearl Harbor style air raid. They will attempt to take out Ukrainian SAM batteries with their own version of HARM missiles (KH-31) and Iranian ballistic missiles (if they actually have them). 

&nbsp;

That would be a desperate attempt to establish air superiority and cut off Western armament deliveries. Now, I don't think Russia has enough skilled pilots and maintenance personnel to have more than 60 jets in the air at  the same time. They don't have anything similar to Bayraktar either. But if Ukrainian air defense takes heavy losses,  monthly missile bombings will get much harder to deal with. Russia can still produce around 50 cruise missiles a month.

&nbsp;

If they decide to proceed with this plan, I can only imagine how many planes will be destroyed. But I don't want to downplay the threat of such mission either, especially if they manage to follow up with possibly heaviest missile barrage since the opening phase of the conflict, using whatever Iskanders, Kinzhals and other ballistic missiles they have left. There is definitely some shift in how they have been using cruise missiles lately. Seems like they are trying to probe Ukrainian AA. Would have been nice to have some F-16s or F-15s already.

Intellectually, we must be honest an allow Ukraine to win quickly and decisively. Dragging the war out even more just to exhaust Russia will only lead to more Ukrainian casualties, which may give the idea that we're using Ukraine as canon fodder to exhaust Russia.

No, we must help Ukraine to WIN quickly, so we can help them rebuild and fortify quickly. Not just ''Hold on and drag this out for as long as possible''.

The only downside is the range — but it should be enough. Russians cannot handle supply depots 150km away from the front lines.

They also may or may not be nine months away. Russia will know when the time has come.

The Leopards, Challengers and Abrams is kinda a mess to be honest. But I'd put my stock on the IFVs instead. They're potent, available and easily integratable. The upgraded T-72s and Leopard 1s will pick up the slack as far as MBTs go. 

As long as the UAF manages to keep their drones in the air in contested airspace to direct artillery, they will manage without the F-16. One can't have too many MiGs though.

They don’t want Ukraine to lose, but realistically I’m becoming more and more convinced that the goal is a forever war for Russia while the Ukranians do the dying. The dribs and drabs of western equipment are turning it into a quagmire. Enough for the Ukranians to hold ground but the gains they make have all come from chutzpah and improvisation. I think the silliness with the Leopards best exemplifies this. You get Zalinskey doing his tour followed by a few announcements over a couple weeks that Challengers and Leopards and Abrams (oh my) are going to be on their way at some point in the future.

Thing is, that’s a stupid way to do it if your goal is to let Ukraine actually retake territory and force Russia out. The haphazard grab bag made sense in the first 4-6 months, but as soon as summer hit, or at the very least after the Kherson offensive, if western powers were really for realisies serious about helping Ukraine actually win rather than just not lose then they should have had themselves an all hands on deck NATO meeting behind closed fucking doors and hashed out how the entirety of the alliance was going to respond. Instead we got a ridiculous dog and pony show of various chancellors and presidents and prime ministers and foreign ministers and retired generals yammering away in front of cameras calling each other out (yes I blame Poland for this) for not doing enough to help. First rule of negotiations is that you DON’T negotiate through the media. It’s stupid.

How it should have gone down is that months ago all the concerned parties should have sent people with the power to negotiate and an understanding of their respective military capacity into a room where they would hash out that they would be sending X, Y and Z material. Then they get Ukraine onboard and tell the Ukraine govt. what they will be sending. Then the Ukranians send troops to train on those systems well away from the media.

The fact that their government is committing crimes against humanity in their name doesn’t seem to be a cause of significant concern.

Sure, it is dangerous to protest in Russia, but that does not prevent Russians in Georgia, Germany and the rest of Europe protesting or making significant noise about the crimes being committed in their name. 

The silence is remarkable.

I do however, see evidence that the Russian people are becoming alarmed at how badly the SMO is going. The alarm is mostly caused by the realisation Russia is losing their war of choice and what that might mean for them personally.

If anything, this might lead to a significant level of dissent in Russia.

Is there a way to scrape and quantify social media contributions while excluding bot accounts? Which of the big data brokers has the most accurate information on the political leanings in Russia? Is it Meta or Google? 

If they can predict flu outbreaks from searches, they can determine political affiliation and likely place a person on the spectrum between pro-occupation/war and the opposition.

My read on this, based on the number of corporations leaving Russia and making a point of doing so is that the population is divided between generations. The people that grew up in the cold war are an easy sell on Russian expansion, where the youth, born into a global monolithic culture are less able to dismiss other humans as enemies because of the flags they wave.

I saw these quotes in an [article dated the 18th](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/18/chinese-peace-plan-for-ukraine-greeted-cautiously-by-the-west).
>At the Munich conference, a succession of European leaders, including the French president Emmanuel Macron, admitted the west should have done more to convince the south that its strong support for Ukraine was not born of double standards.

>“I am struck by how we have lost the trust of the global south,” Macron said. He argued that the world’s response to the war showed the need to rebalance the global order and make its institutions more inclusive.

>Rishi Sunak also admitted that the west should have done more to persuade the global south that food prices had rocketed due to Russia bombarding Ukrainian wheat fields, and not western sanctions. Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, who condemned Russia’s crimes against humanity, said the solution to the global south’s doubts was to treat them as partners.

>Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, who has travelled recently to Brazil and South Africa in a largely fruitless bid to extract clearer condemnations of Russia, told the Munich audience: “In order to be credible and achieve something as a European or North American in Jakarta, New Delhi, Pretoria, Santiago de Chile, Brasília or Singapore, it is not enough to invoke common values.”

I will note that treating the Ukrainians as expendable is very much a Russian thing, and in the this viewpoint we are talking about and the Russian viewpoints agree. 

Another aspect is that the blame for the situation is placed on the West for not doing enough to help stop the Russians. The Russians, too, would prefer this, that the West get blamed instead of them. You know, the lying sons-of-bitches who actually started this war and deserve 100% of the blame. 

So I understand the impatience, and the desire for a quick fix: if the West were only to release the weapons this whole thing would end quickly. Unfortunately this is just not true. The suffering will continue, and it will remain 100% Russia's fault. The West has done wonders, and most considerations on what has or has not been delivered have tendency to gloss over those things that have been done in contrast to those things that haven't, because obviously more can be done as the suffering hasn't stopped. 

But this is letting the conclusion lead the horse, and is motivated thinking. The suffering will stop when Russia stops the suffering, and yes I do think the West is doing their best to help Ukraine win the fight with the best tools they can use right now to do that. The calculus is both tricky and uncertain. Mistakes will be made. Things will happen as less-than-optimal efficiency. These things are unavoidable facts of life. No one is doing this on purpose to maximally hurt the Russians. That seems like it's going to happen in any case, and again that's on them , not us. 

And just to tag on a similar argument, the Military Industrial Complex is also going to get rich no matter what happens. They too don't need to juice the machine to make more money off this conflict and drag it out. The Russians are already doing that for them. We are, in fact, crushing Russia as fast as we can.

This is not a civil war and never was, every move that so-called separatists did was coming from Kremlin directly. I mean when it all started literally the head of the separatist and the minister of defense were both Moscow citizens, Strelkov and Borodai  it was the highest positions of power in there.

But they inherited unsustainable situations and took the opportunity of their succession to power to try to stabilise their regimes by making significant (positive) concessions. This did not actually save their regimes or their own political careers but it is a lesson that the main resistance to concession comes from stubborn incumbents (Putin) who have everything to lose if they acknowledge a failing situation. Conceding to resolve an unwinnable situation is also one of the ways that a new leader can undermine the previous leader's credibility (e.g. Nixon and Vietnam) and blame their mistakes for national failure.

The most likely scenario (of all the many) is that Putin's successor will naturally be a nationalist; non-nationalists won't get a look in when Putin goes as it is likely to accompanied by a fervent, and dangerous climate of betrayal narratives from the nationalist wing.

12746f3bcd0175effa2ee564e9e6c324,1156bk4,j91rl86,"The German Greens have a very difficult history with lots of influences that made them into the party they are today.

They came into being out of opposition against nuclear power, against the NATO double track decision (which has been ironically been pushed forward by the SPD which is nowadays very divided on the Russian question) and as a general movement for stricter environmental policy.

In the wake of the German re-unification they merged with an eastern German movement called Bündnis 90 (loosely “Pact of 1990“), which was not so much made up of environmentalists and pacifists, but of people who had peacefully but forcefully resisted the Soviet and Socialist oppression of Eastern Germany.

In 1998 / early 1999 the now so called “Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen“ together with the Social Democrats (SPD) took over the federal government after 16 years of conservative rule. Practically the very first decision of the new government under Schröder was German participation in the NATO-Yugoslav war over the Kosovo question. The most prominent figure of the Greens was Joschka Fischer, an illustrious personality, once a “street fighter“ against the establishment, and he was our Foreign Minister. He forced the Greens into accepting the government policy, which was a humanitarian intervention. He famously said “Never again war is only the first part of our historic lesson, the second one is Never again Auschwitz“.

After this a lot of people left the Green party, who wouldn't support this policy shift. Ever since the German Greens are “the right kind of pacifist“, which means eternal vigilance and the readiness to intervene militarily, if need be.

The Greens have been critical of Russia for a long time, in part because of their experiences from Eastern Germany, in part because of the necessity to steer away from Russian coal and gas, in part because of their social liberal agenda which is of course at odds with the Russian right-wing autocracy and oppression.

Annalena Baerbock was the only top candidate for the last federal election who openly and very loudly criticized Russia and demanded to cut our fossile imports and stop Nord Stream 2. That's one of the most important reasons why I voted for her and her party. She was and she is absolutely right.",1676742024.0,1676736272.0,t3_1156bk4,t1_j91lxxt,,3,16,0,16,0,0,

The Ukrainian figures don't distinguish between KIA and WIA, and WIA tends to be 2x-3x the KIA figures in modern combat, which may account for the difference.

In January Defence analysts who are quoted every day on this thread challenged whether the Russian force in Ukraine resembles one that has lost 120,000 troops KIA (between 25-40% of its number), as Ukraine claims. They challenged that, while we will never know, the actual observed reduction in force capability appeared to suggest KIA figures of closer to half of the Ukrainian number.

Ah! This old thing, I remember that. The problem with this was this one is that this was false! It wasn't for ""gender studies,"" it was for promotion of women's rights -- something the US has championed for years. \[[Source](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/us-congress-clears-25-million-for-democracy-gender-programmes-in-pakistan-120122201575_1.html)\]

That's why even Lindsey Graham was for it. He said about the program (on Fox News): ""Pakistan is a place I really worry about. Eighty-five countries a woman can't open up a bank account without her husband's signature. She can't inherit property. If you're a young girl in Pakistan life is pretty tough. So we're trying to make life better for women throughout the world.""

So this ""issue"" cropped up due to intentionally misleading distraction campaigns, as part of a broader cultural campaign to attack COVID bills (which had plenty of issues, but not really this one). It was presented as if the US was exporting a tiny liberal arts college gender studies 101 course circa 2002 -- which is just weird! (There was also 15 million for Pakistan to promote democracy.)

And this ends up being a repeated problem -- so many conservatives end up taking almost comical misinformation uncritically, and it shepherds them to some strange policy discussions.

Well previous to the last invasion after 2015 the war was fairly ""quiet"" with only small engagements and the odd bit of artillery, neither side was making big pushes to try and capture large amounts of territory. That's why it was referred to as a ""frozen conflict"" at times.

Now taking back Crimea would be tough but assuming Ukraine can take the southern part of mainland Ukraine back and take out the Kerch bridge all the sudden Russia has the same problem they did in Kherson city, a lot of people and soldiers that will be very hard to keep supplied. And a lot of those pro Putin citizens left when the bridge was damaged because they realized they might be trapped there permanently in the future.

Obviously pushing in Crimea along the two narrow access points will be tough but against a weakened and demoralized Russian army that has by that point probably lost most of Eastern Ukraine and hasn't been properly supplied in months all the sudden it looks a lot more possible. Still tough sure but I'm not sure why you would assume Ukraine would require assistance to do it, which but that I assume you mean soldiers and air support from other nations.

Ukraine did not want to start a war with Russia over Crimea. But they have the war now anyway.

We agree here. But that is different from saying Crimea can only be returned to Ukraine through foreign intervention. Which I take as Western countries entering the war. Ukraine receives and will receive a tremendous amount of weapons that are way more advanced than what Russia could produce. More effective, more precise. Russia is able to keep Crimea by constantly supplying it with military resources through the land bridge they secured at the beginning of the war.

I merely pointed out that it wasn't 50+ years ago that USA went around changing governments in sovereign nations. It happened very recently - Iraq of which is just one example and they did it to benefit themselves or their coalition.

Every conflict in history involves benefit to the participants. I don't really understand your point here.
