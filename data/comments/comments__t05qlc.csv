EU foreign policy chief: Russia attack is one of ""darkest hours for Europe since World War II""
From CNN’s Joseph Ataman in Paris and Amy Cassidy
Russia's attack on Ukraine Thursday ranked among the ""darkest hours for Europe"" in nearly 80 years, according to the European Union's foreign policy chief.

“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War II,” EU High Representative Josep Borrell told reporters.
Borrell promised “urgent assistance to Ukraine,” as well as supporting evacuation efforts, including of EU staff.

EU sanctions: Speaking alongside EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Borrell said punitive measures from the 27-member bloc against Russia would be “the harshest packet of sanctions that has ever been implemented.”

Von der Leyen said she will present “massive and strategic” sanctions against Russia for approval later today",False,1645693636.0,t3_t05qlc,t3_t05qlc,,0,13,0,13,0,0,

Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

Putin lashes out with ominous threat to Ukrainians and other countries
Analysis by Jill Dougherty
Before the crack of dawn, just before explosions began in cities across Ukraine, Russian state television unexpectedly broadcast an address by Russian President Vladimir Putin.  

The two self-proclaimed ""people's republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk, in the breakaway Ukrainian region of Donbas, which he had officially recognized as independent less than two days before, had ""turned to Russia with a request for help,"" he said. To answer that call he was launching a ""special military operation."" Its purpose: to ""demilitarize"" and ""denazifiy"" Ukraine. 

Within minutes, Russian missiles began hitting targets in Ukraine. ""Our actions are self-defense against threats,"" he told his fellow Russians, claiming Moscow had no plans to occupy Ukraine. ""We do not plan to impose ourselves on anyone,"" he insisted.

Putin described the ""special military operation"" in limited terms, to protect people living in Donbas who, he claimed, had been subjected to ""genocide,"" a charge that Ukraine has strenuously denied. But in the next breath, he lashed out more broadly: ""NATO supports Ukrainian neo-Nazis ... our actions are self-defense against threats."" 

Then, in an extraordinary passage, he spoke directly to members of Ukraine's military, at that very moment in the crosshairs of the Russian military. Addressing them as ""dear comrades,"" he told them they had taken an ""oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and not to the anti-people junta that is robbing Ukraine and abuses those same people.""

""Don't follow its criminal orders!"" he demanded. ""I urge you to lay down your weapons and go home."" 

As he has done so many times before, Putin claimed Russia had no choice but to defend itself. With a hard-edged tone in his voice, he seemed to threaten the US, Europe and NATO which, in just a few minutes, would witness his armed forces opening fire on Ukraine, something the Kremlin had consistently dismissed as western ""hysterics."" 

""Whoever tries to interfere with us, and even more so, to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences that you have never experienced in your history.

""We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made.""

Putin, who for years had criticized the West for ignoring his complaints about NATO's expansion toward Russia's borders, was finally striking back with fury. ""I hope,"" he concluded his short address, ""that I have been heard.""",False,1645693824.0,t3_t05qlc,t3_t05qlc,,0,24,0,24,0,0,

The second is that Ukraine has resources that would improve the economic position of Russia, idk what it could be tho, i know it has some fertile land and coal, but it doesnt seem to be worth considering the sanctions, army costs, and the further upkeep costs of an annexation.

The third one is political, he's doing this because if it goes right and a annexation comes quickly it would make him more popular and because war times are good to suppress political opponents without much alarm.

>I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.  
>  
>Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity.

>To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

“Dugin wrote a book about it, but the ideas he had in his book were not original. Dude is well connected with top Russian military and intelligence officers. He was just writing about the general sentiment within those circles.

Rather than think of him as a master mind, it's much more believable to think of Dugin as reflecting Russian nationalist strategic thinking around the year 1997. His writing's relevance to today shows that much of these ideas have not basically changed.

That said, not all the ideas in the book have stayed current. For instance, Dugin had called for dismantling China and annexing its northern territories to create a buffer zone for Russia, while encouraging China to expand in Southeast Asia instead. But Russia has done nothing of the sort in the past two decades, because situations have changed since 1997 when China was weaker, more fragile, and more aligned with the West and hostile to Russia. Today, China is none of these, so Russian strategic thinking has shifted, as Putin has demonstrated with his recent moves to align with China.”",1645692856.0,1645692581.0,t3_t05qlc,t1_hy7ulhj,,1,3,0,3,0,0,

Your comment is very shallow, as it is straight up false that the Swiss pandered to the Nazi's in WW2. 

They maintained an armed neutrality, and had to defend that neutrality from both sides. I just want to highlight that it's not as simple as you think. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/aih5mi/switzerlands_role_in_wwii/

Here's a good brief read on it. 

In this case, the Swiss see themselves at the mercy of the banking system. They are playing neutral as they are in a unique position once again. As they have mentioned, the fact that they themselves may ""embargo trade services to promote human rights"" sends the message that they will take actions, but not at the discretion of the EU, but as themselves. Ensuring that there will be no circumvention through the Swiss banking system is already huge on its own. 

You have you remember that the Red Cross originates from Switzerland. Historically, it is the West/Allied powers that heavily utilized their services.

""The long-feared Russian invasion of Ukraine began at approximately 4AM local time in Kyiv, lining up with a previous rumor that the invasion would begin at that time. In announcing this action, President Putin declared that Russia would engage in special military operations in the Donbas and stated that his aims in Ukraine were to de-militarize and de-nazify the country to protect Russian security interests. Since then, Russian forces have begun their assault on Ukraine, using cruise missiles and bombers to take out military facilities, particularly anti-air installations. Some reports state that hundreds may have already been killed in the attacks, which have now targeted all major cities in the country, including in the extreme Western city of Lviv. Social media videos also show tanks coming into Ukraine from Crimea in the South and and approaching the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city. Belarus has also joined in the attack, placing its troops under unified Russian command as these forces attack from Ukraine's north, where they are extremely close to the capital city of Kyiv.

The response from Western nations has been to express solidarity with Ukraine, but with few other options on hand. The G7 is convening a meeting in the morning to discuss the development, with the EU and US among others working to consolidate around a package of punishing economic sanctions against Russia. Baltic NATO states have also invoked Article 4 of the treaty, calling for emergency consultations over fears for their territorial integrity. The invasion has sparked a collapse of the Russian rouble and Moscow stock market, and led to a spike in oil prices, with the Brent crude benchmark exceeding $100/bbl for the first time in 8 years.

I would first point you to experts on Russia and foreign policy, but they don't know either. The ones I've read think this invasion is a surprisingly irrational move on Putin's part. The simple answer is that WW3 is unlikely, but it just got a teensy bit more likely than it was yesterday. 

Compared to the rest of world history, it's actually quite remarkable that the world has gone nearly 80 years without a war between major powers. That's because of nukes, aka ""mutually assured destruction"": the only way to win a nuclear war is to not play. In other words, starting WW3 is guaranteed suicide because sooner or later someone will use their nuclear arsenal, and the other side will fire back, and then everybody loses in a matter of minutes. Even if you thought you could get away with using yours while preventing the other side from using theirs, what would it profit you? There wouldn't be any territory worth conquering if it's radioactive. The world economy would be shattered in a way that would take decades to recover from. Even in the countries of the victor, there would be serious environmental damage.

Meanwhile, NATO is too afraid to fight in any meaningful way unless they feel like they'll die either way. We are a zillion miles away from that kind of situation right now, and Putin's probably not crazy enough to advance on NATO countries, which would push NATO to that brink. So we're all just going to do a lot of yelling at each other and talking about ineffectual sanctions and not much else will happen except a lot of poeple in Eastern Europe will die until Putin has taken back every European country he wants that isn't a NATO member.
